If he's younger than say 12 or 13, you needed to go get him and force him to come home, but at a certain point you just gotta let them make bad decisions. Judging by the fact that he successfully made it to his older brother's place, I'm guessing he's old enough to make these kinds of stupid decisions and have to deal with the consequences.\n\nI actually had something very similar happen with my younger brother. He was maybe 15 or 16 at the time. We were at a family function that we had all driven to together. He and I were ready to leave and he asked my mom when we were going home. She said 5-10 minutes, but that time came and went and she was still just sitting around chatting with family. He got pissed off and started walking home. It's about a 5 mile walk, so doable, but it was below freezing outside and he wasn't really dressed for those kinds of temperatures, so he would have realistically lost a few fingers and toes before making it home, if he didn't call an Uber, call one of us, stop into a store, or do any one of a number of things to prevent that. My parents drove alongside him for like 15 minutes asking him to get into the car, but he refused cuz he was feeling stubborn. I started to get annoyed. He was practically an adult and he had made his (albeit very dumb) choice.  Finally we just drove home and left him on the side of the road. Another fifteen minutes later he called, freezing cold, apologizing, and asking to be picked up. \n\nBut I mean, point is, what did he want you to do? If he's a teenager, were you going to physically force him to come home? He wanted to run away, you respected his wishes, and now he's mad? Fuck around and find out.", "Info: how old is your son?", "INFO How old is your kid?", "NTA. Kid is 14. Nothing seems harder on parents than when their kid goes through puberty. He's old enough to take a bus and your oldest is sensible enough to keep you in the loop. Kid was mad you let him leave while being mad you brought em back. Do what you can, do your best, and good luck.", "Info: how old (roughly) is your son? If he's an older teen than n t a", "NTA.  It\u2019s called tough love. You both knew he was okay. And had you not then after a bit more time, reported him as a missing runaway. Your wife\u2019s way is pretty much accepting him yanking her around.", "This is complicated. In this specific instance I'll say NTA - if you had gone to get him, he would've been mad that you forced him to come home. But, I think this is all a big cry for attention. He clearly feels like he is missing something from you, and he even told you so when he said he couldn't believe you didn't come to get him.\n\nI'd approach this with love and empathy, not with anger. Tell him that you don't know what to do to help him, but you want to understand. Approach him wanting to better hear his perspective. Start there and see where it goes.\n\nEdit to add: why didn't mom go get him?", "YTA  \n\n\nWhich one of you is a teenager again? Imagine feeling like your parents don't understand you and they don't care enough about you. so you emotionally leave to provoke some type of reaction, and you are met with complete disregard for your safety and feelings.

How far is it to your oldest child's apartment?", "Without understanding all the circumstances, I find it hard to pass a judgment. Is your city dangerous? Would it have been on the safe for him to go to his brothers on his own?

Teenagers are emotionally difficult, sometimes a bit of tough love is good for them. At 14 they're old enough to look after themselves for a day.", "NTA. 14 is perfectly old enough to learn consequences from his actions..He knew to go to a safe place, he's just goading you now, you're right, damned if you do, damned if you don't with this situation", "YTA\n\nThe kid is 14. Sure a bit of distance when tensions and anger are high is a good thing but you had *no idea where he was going.* What if he got hit by a vehicle? What if he ran into some thugs?

You conveniently don't tell us a cause, but from the behavior your kid probably just wanted his parents to show him they care enough about him to stop him from leaving. You sure showed him you don't!

Anything else other than that is you posturing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy was he angry? What was the argument about? Were you hoping something would happen to him so he'd learn a lesson?

It must have been bad if he felt like he had to make a statement by running away and your wife seems angry at you as well.\n\nThe standards of asshole vastly differ between a young teen and a grown ass adult, even if he was being difficult you'd think that as the father in this situation you would be more inclined to get the issue resolved right away and not let reddit dispute your family mess.", "Nta. Ditch them both.", "Info: Perhaps your kid is going through puberty? Can you state why he started acting out to his own parents?
