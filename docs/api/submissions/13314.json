If he's younger than say 12 or 13, you needed to go get him and force him to come home, but at a certain point you just gotta let them make bad decisions. Judging by the fact that he successfully made it to his older brother's place, I'm guessing he's old enough to make these kinds of stupid decisions and have to deal with the consequences.\n\nI actually had something very similar happen with my younger brother. He was maybe 15 or 16 at the time. We were at a family function that we had all driven to together. He and I were ready to leave and he asked my mom when we were going home. She said 5-10 minutes, but that time came and went and she was still just sitting around chatting with family. He got pissed off and started walking home. It's about a 5 mile walk, so doable, but it was below freezing outside and he wasn't really dressed for those kinds of temperatures, so he would have realistically lost a few fingers and toes before making it home, if he didn't call an Uber, call one of us, stop into a store, or do any one of a number of things to prevent that. My parents drove alongside him for like 15 minutes asking him to get into the car, but he refused cuz he was feeling stubborn. I started to get annoyed. He was practically an adult and he had made his (albeit very dumb) choice.  Finally we just drove home and left him on the side of the road. Another fifteen minutes later he called, freezing cold, apologizing, and asking to be picked up. \n\nBut I mean, point is, what did he want you to do?

It\u2019s not acceptable to use language like that, get no consequences and both parents argue over which way to ignore the fact he\u2019s picked up a disgusting word and feels free to use it.\n\nAnd before you go oh but he\u2019s only 14, I was a disabled 14 year old kid who had that word thrown at them and it sticks with me at age 44 because it is definitely always a insult designed to make the other person feel lesser. If your 12 year old has any disabilities this is even worse. But either way, he\u2019s 14 and if you haven\u2019t instilled not bullying into him, it\u2019s a good time to learn. You are way too blase about the ableist language.\n\nAlso if he\u2019s big enough to use language like that without thought to the hurt it causes, he\u2019s big enough to take a bus. You and your wife are giving him incredibly mixed messages with your parenting. ESH except your other kids.", "By telling them to stop fighting about nothing, you basically didn't stop your 12 yo to call your 14 yo dumb for something he seems to be passionate about. And if this was not the first time something like this happening, a hormonal teenager might feel totally devalidated and would think you are ignorant for the things important to him (well, even adults would)  \n\n\nAt 14, having no clue where your son is going, taking the bus at night... YTA", "Okay? So where I live it\u2019s 14? I live on a farm so I\u2019ve been driving on private land since I could sit on my dads lap? Never had an issue. Also as far as I\u2019m aware AB doesn\u2019t have learners permits dying left right and center so they can obviously see over the wheel", " I think some family therapy with you, your wife, and runaway kid might be a good option.", "I asked him about why exactly the mom didn\u2019t like the older kid. It felt like there was something missing.", "Yes, because his middle kid might then be her oldest kid, if his oldest kid isn't her kid.", "I am my mother's oldest but my father's middle, like the kid in the OP. This is what happens with multiple marriages/kids, the child will be in different birth orders depending on which parent you're referencing.", "Definitely a great playwright. I took him to see Amadeus at our local community theater last year, and he loved it; it's such a great play. Theatre kids being dramatic, how could anyone have foreseen this?? I jest.", "You may well be right about everybody needing space, in fact, I think you probably are.", "Teenagers are emotionally difficult, sometimes a bit of tough love is good for them. At 14 they're old enough to look after themselves for a day.", "Understood, but OP hasn\u2019t confirmed yet that they don\u2019t share all the kids. You could be right. But it could also be that all three are full siblings.", "Calling someone the R word is not being dramatic, it\u2019s horrible", "R word?..Can I have a clue?", "The little brother used the R word and you're right that it is not neccessarily being dramatic. But 14 year old was def acting out cuz I guess he wanted his dad to tell his brother that playwrites can be rich."]}
