The letter also gave me a \u201chome\u201d to start with for leads and said don\u2019t ask your family for help, they\u2019ll deny it. \n\nI confronted my parents, who were devastated that this finally reached me, but they were honest with me. It happened when they were both 16 and my grandparents forced my mother to go to a religious home until the baby was born. While there she was mentally beaten down and degraded, the girls, all pregnant teens, were only allowed to go outside via a backyard with a high fence (so no one could see them because they were so sinful.) my mother only saw the baby girl for a few seconds before \u201cAlison\u201d was taken away and she returned home and was told to never mention it to the family or anyone again. \n\nEventually my mom got pregnant again with me in college l, was forced to drop out, and there was a \u201cshotgun wedding.\u201d My parents are still together. \n\nLearning about this explained SO much about the dynamics of my family, and my parents admitted that they stayed in the area hoping they\u2019d be easier for my sister to find one day if she wanted. But neither wanted to actively look for her, they said it was their daughter\u2019s decision if she wanted to search and they asked me not to. \n\nBut without telling them I spent 5 very hard years searching for her only to find out that she died as a child.  The paper trail was horrible, it\u2019s still a miracle that I was able to finally get as much information as I did. She has no death certificate. It broke me, don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you you can\u2019t mourn someone you never met. \n\nMy parents have never mentioned her again since the day I confronted them and I mourned alone and kept her death to myself this past decade. But a few weeks ago my mother said something unusual that makes me think she\u2019s finally ready to search for her daughter via the internet. (She won\u2019t find anything there\u2019s no digital trail.) My parent\u2019s health is delicate and my dad is fighting cancer. I know learning about her death when they\u2019re in their 70\u2019s would be incredibly devastating. \n\nTo me, it would be better to just think there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019s happy to be here, rather than learn she never had a chance to live.

I trust your judgement. I am so sorry for your loss and for the trauma your mother and whole family went through, and mostly for Alison. This story broke my heart. You have been an amazing sibling to find these answers and I'm devastated for you that they are so horrible.", "Wow, this is really a tough one. I would imagine even if they haven\u2019t mentioned their other child to you in years, they still probably have conversations amongst themselves about her from time to time. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve kept this secret from my parents but I can understand why you would want to shield them from it. Whatever you decide to do, I wish you and your family well.", "NTA. Don't tell them. There is absolutely nothing for them to be gained from that knowledge except pain.", "NTA. Your parents sound like sweet and wonderful people who were victims of an awful system. As are you, in a way. Now, should you tell them what you know? They sound like strong people to me, and I lean towards \u201cyes\u201d.  If it were me, I would want to know.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nFirst, I am so sorry for your loss. You definitely can mourn someone you never met, especially if you dedicated five years of your life looking for them. \n\nAs for what to do, I think you\u2019ve made the right choice not to say anything. A close friend of mine, now in his 70s, lost a child to a forced adoption as a young teen. He is still in touch with the mother despite both of them being married the past 50+ years. They get together often and he shared with me that they still talk about the loss. When they talk, they will try to imagine what their child might be doing- maybe they\u2019re married, maybe they have children, they wonder how many, where they might live, etc. It brings them a little peace and shared comfort to talk about the life they brought into the world. \n\nIf your parents decide to look for her, you might want to put some thought into reconsidering your decision, but I think you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NAH - I probably would tell them, IF she actually began searching, but you're not TA if you don't, either. And I can't see how your parents are TA in this situation, either.", "NTA. You would only be telling them for your own sake. This does nothing to benefit them in any way. It can only cause them pain, needlessly.", "NAH. I don't think there are any good options here. I'm sorry.", "This is not the right subreddit for this question. NTA either way.", "NTA \nI am so sorry for your loss.  I believe that your gut instincts are correct. This information would be devastating.  At this stage of their lives, it would be best to let them believe she is out there somewhere doing well.  They would likely blame themselves if they found out the truth and take that guilt and regret to the grave.  Since it was so challenging for you to uncover the truth, it seems unlikely that they will find out unless you tell them.  While it will be difficult to keep this to yourself, i think it is a secret worth keeping.  Don't hesitate t seek counseling to help you through this.  Not only are you NTA, but you are clearly a kind and compassionate person who wishes to spare their parents much grief.", "This is way above AITA\u2019s pay grade. There is no right or wrong answer. My best advice would be to go with your instincts.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Never speak of this again.", "NTA. There is no clear, easy choice here. I am sorry for the burdens your family bears. <3", "NTA, it's one of those is it better to live in ignorance and have hope or live a devastating truth with a chance of closure/pain. Use your best judgment. Both have their merits.", "I think your mother suffered for many years because the people around her thought that they knew better than she did. She had her daughter, her childhood, and her freedom taken from her. I think it would be wrong to take this choice from her, too. \n\nLet your mother mourn her daughter. That\u2019s her right. So I say this so gently, because I have nothing but sympathy for: YTA if you do not tell her. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss. I hope you and your family can find peace.", "NTA but you need to tell them. They may not have mentioned her in a long time but im sure she's in their thoughts every day.  EDIT: if I were in your parents position, I would want to know.\n\nMaybe don't mention how long you've known everything you know- they might be upset that you didn't tell them sooner. Just tell them that when your mum said what she said a few weeks ago, it prompted you to start looking.", "Very soft YTA. I understand your thinking but I do think your parents deserve the opportunity to know the truth. Let them decide if they want to hear the story. \n\nYou could tell them that you know about their daughter and can give them answers (and probably closure); you\u2019ll share with the the information if they are comfortable. For so long people have made decisions for them without including them in the process (yourself included) let them finally make an informed decision about their own daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they become overly obsessive or distressed about not being able to find her I'd admit the truth. But if it's going to provide more pain than relief then there's no point. \n\nRegardless I'd find someone I could trust who's separated from the situation to talk to OP. A therapist or friend, it's not healthy just keeping all this to yourself.", "NTA. Sometimes, there's no good answer. But I believe you are only as sick as your secrets. There's ways to tell them gently. They will have time to mourn. It might free them of any ambivalence about trying to find her before they die.", "NAH.  You did what many people would have done.   I think the best thing to do is to ask your parents if they wanted to find out what happened and if they would still want to know if the news was bad.  Trust their judgment on this. It might be that they need closure.   If they want to know, volunteer to do some looking around.  Come back to them with what you know. Decide whether or not you want to tell them when you found out. Don't lie but you are not obligated to tell them details of your earlier search.", "I would argue against that...these people have already had so much pain and grief in their lives because of people taking their choices around their family from them. Don't they deserve, at least once, to have their choice honored, even if the information is painful?", "I actually asked and my dad told me later that day that in 39 years he\u2019d only brought Alison up once and my mom told him she wasn\u2019t talking about it. The level of PTSD I realize now that she\u2019s lived with is heartbreaking. \n\nAs a side note, the only discussion my grandmother had when my mom returned was to ask if she had a photo of the baby. (Of course she wasn\u2019t allowed that.)  When I was small, my grandparents had these hanging connected frames in the house of all the grandkids, in age order, and the top frame was empty. I realized later this was my grandmother gaslighting my mom, for a daughter and grand daughter she rejected when my mom needed support and love the most. And my poor mom had to see that frame every time she was over there.", "I had this, too, while I was looking for her. Just the idea of what she\u2019d be like and how amazing it would be to have a sister. To lose that sense of hope in what might have been was as devastating as finding out she was gone.", "That is some Flowers in the Attic level mind game from your grandma. Your poor mother! I am sure the reason she never wanted to talk about it or search is because of the tremendous guilt and pain she felt. I say this as an adoptee who was reunited with his birth mother when I was in my early 30s.\n\nEDIT: NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine how your mother would deal with the knowledge that your sister died as a child. She would forever beat herself up thinking she might still be alive if she had kept her.", "I didn't think it could get worse holy smokes"]}
