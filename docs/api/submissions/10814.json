Good grief.", "Airplanes are a place for passive aggressive behaviors. \n\nYou should have just let out an exasperated sigh. Especially with you not being in a hurry. \n\nBut she was inconsiderate.

You weren't trying to catch a layover, and you most likely ended up standing around the luggage carousel waiting for your bags anyway.  You didn't need to say anything to her.

I get , I really I do. It would have cost her nothing to move out of the way. That being said, I literally never make comments to another passenger deplaning. It costs you MAYBE 2 minutes of your life to just chill and let her get her stuff together. You know not everyone flies often, just chill out.", "ESH. Flying is a pain in the neck and other people are sometimes awful. Should she have moved? Yes. Did you need to say something? Not really. If you travel a lot then you\u2019re well aware that you\u2019d probably buzz by her on the walkway and then you\u2019ll both get held up at the luggage carousel or immigration or the taxi rank.  Let it go.", "YTA. Cause you travel alot, I expect you to realize that boarding/de-boarding always takes longer than it should cause w/e reasons. You should know this. This chat wasn't going to speed anything along. You know that.", "INFO honestly, realistically, how long did she hold up the line? Are we talking a minute or two (that felt like an hour after travel) or more than four or five minutes?", "YTA.  It's not like you're going to save that much time.  She was being considerate letting an elderly person in front get off.  Someone trying to slide by and accidentally bumping her could be bad. \n\nEveryone raises off the plane and if it's your final stop you're just going to sit on your ass. Waiting for your bags anyways.", "Have you tried putting on your coat while crouched over because the overhead bins are low and with others still in the row? I\u2019m below average size and it can be a challenge. It\u2019s a coat. If you truly fly a lot, then you know it is impossible to get stuff from the bin until you are out in the aisle. And putting on a coat in winter is extremely reasonable. YTA.", "INFO: Why couldn't you just sit down and wait for more people to file out?", "INFO: It really all depends on how long she was taking. If people ahead of her were still on the plane, you should have just chilled out another minute or two.", "YTA. Would I have put my jacket on like that? No. But the thirty seconds she was taking really aren't that big of a deal. You decided to make someone else day a little worse on purpose. You probably have spent more time thinking about and writing this post than you would have saved had she stepped aside.", "NTA I am all about \"move out of the way if you need to stop for something\" - on planes, on sidewalks, at escalators, all of it.  I still get angry thinking about this woman who decided to stop and order an Uber...in the doorway of a theater that was letting out.  GO OUTSIDE!!!", "I mean it doesn't take long to put on a jacket.", "In an airport everyone is kind of just rushing to wait in another line.", "Nope, they were all empty as they had deplaned, except for the lady, her partner and the other lady I mentioned.", "It\u2019s really amazing. As soon as the seatbelt sign dings off, people catapult into the aisle. I just sit there in my window seat until we\u2019re the next row in line, I get up grab my bag, and leave. I don\u2019t get it!!", "It\u2019s really not, because if every person on a 120-person flight took 30 seconds in the aisle to \u201cget themselves organized\u201d, it would take an hour to get everyone off the plane.\n\nThe only reason it doesn\u2019t take that long is because 90% of us have our shit together and the 10% that don\u2019t only cause the disembarking to take 20 mins instead of an hour. \n\nNTA", "Spoken by someone who rarely flies. \n\nIt\u2019s the principle. If everyone did that, we\u2019d never get on or off flights.

No aggression, passive or active, necessary.  \nNTA", "I'm usually the passive aggressive sigher...it may have been the exhaustion that compelled me to speak up on this occasion. I'm still suffering from jetlag.", "And people like her are one of the reasons deboarding takes longer than it needs to.  Maybe you have the patience to be inconvenienced by thoughtless people.  The lady could have certainly gone through her belongings in her own aisle and didnt need to hold up and entire airplane's worth of passengers.  The rest of us not so much and OP didnt cross any lines to ask her to move to the side so the rest of them could get on.  NTA", "- 120 person flight\n\n- Each person takes 30 seconds to futz around in the aisle \n\n- it takes AN HOUR to disembark\n\nSo no, your logic is incorrect. The behavior described by OP is a huge no no. Stay out of the aisles, people, until you\u2019re ready to move.", "Yes its a challenge but it still doesnt give you the reason to block an entire plane full of people bc rummaging through your bag and needing to put on a coat is more important.\n\nIm 6'1\" and know what you're saying about the cramped space under the overhead bin.  I still do my own business in my seat row and not in the exit row.", "Yeah\u2026I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and I always put my coat on in the seats, or after I get off the plane. Because I don\u2019t want to block the aisle.", "Why does someone need to out their coat on before exiting the plane?  Put it on outside the plane!  Don\u2019t hold up the whole plane.  Some in the back could be trying to make a connection or not miss the last rental car bus.", "I didn't time it but longer than needed. Everyone in front except that other lady I mentioned were all gone already. I wasn't in a rush, had checked bag to collect, it was more the inconsideration she had for the nearly full plane she had behind her that bothered me.", "Then NTA.", "[deleted]", "You nailed it. I bet this woman also stands in a bus queue for ten minutes, then when the bus turns up gets on and then starts fannying around in her purse for money.", "Typical low-effort comment to invalidate an opinion you disagree with. And incorrect by (frequent-flier) miles.", ">  Maybe you have the patience to be inconvenienced by thoughtless people.\n\nIn air travel, I think you have to have that patience and charge it to the reality of getting to travel via the air.", "Exactly, only exit was from the front.", "Sorry? \u201cLow-effort\u201d? Lol that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen that. Are you going by comment length? Bc mine was longer than yours to which I replied. I\u2019m honestly intrigued by that statement.\n\nWant the high-effort answer? Some things qualify as standard, \u201cproper\u201d behavior because if everyone does them, society functions in an efficient and orderly manner. Conversely, if everyone behaves the opposite way, everything falls apart.\n\nIf everyone did what this woman did, it would take a minimum of an hour for a 120-person plane to disembark.\n\nJust because the rest of us are keeping things moving by behaving the proper way, and therefore people like this woman don\u2019t TOTALLY ruin everyone\u2019s day, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to sit there silently while something is being an inconsiderate, self-important AH. OP was very polite, and it was a fair request.\n\nAnd finally, just bc you\u2019re willing to happily watch AHs inconvenience you, and let them inconvenience everyone behind you, doesn\u2019t mean I have to be too. Also doesn\u2019t make me an AH.", "You really do bc inconsiderate, thoughtless & entitled people do exist and unfortunately cant see past their own nose as to how their behavior impacts everyone else.\n\nWe cannot blame OP for having the optics to see such behavior and call it out.", "It's low effort because it relies on the assumption that I don't fly frequently enough to have an informed opinion on this topic. \n\nIt's like users who comment \"You must not have kids\" or \"Found the cheater boyfriend!\" or \"You must be a dude to say that.\"", "I don't see an AH ruling as blame though. Just an adjudication of the situation. We can't scream at all the angry clouds of incompetence that we come in contact with.", "Nobody screamed at anyone here.  OP was polite, yet assertive.  We can call out such incompetence as we encounter it and still be courteous about it.", "I was speaking more to the utility of it trying to parallel the \"old man screams at cloud\" meme. Its not gonna speed anyone up. Its gonna create a conversation that will slow them further.", "I travel a lot too. NTA. People like that should be put on the no fly list, which is something which is VASTLY underutilized thing.", "NTA, people have no consideration for others on airplanes", "ESH. It's not that serious.", ">This is a pretty common practice to let people get themselves organized to get off the plane.\n\nYou get organised at your seat before stepping into the aisle, then you grab your case from the overhead and go.\n\nIf you really need to get organised after getting your bag out from the overhead, then go back to your seat and leave the aisle clear. \n\nIt's just selfish to block the aisle for longer than absolutely necessary, OP is NTA", "Why should OP have to do that?", "Maybe it\u2019s because of my adhd, but basically as soon as the seatbelt sign goes off I feel like I must get off the plane immediately. \n\nAt the very least I need to stand in the aisle. If I don\u2019t have an aisle seat I am miserable until it\u2019s time for me to move.", "Exactly. You get as long in the aisle as it takes to get your bag in/out of the overhead locker. Thassit.\n\nIf you need to pack stuff after that you move back into a seat row. An empty one, so you're not blocking anyone else. \n\nIf you've got a whole collection if stuff in the seat pocket/in your lap/wherever, you have your shit together and ready to move before it's time to deplane. \n\nThe whole one-narrow-exit-for-100-people thing is annoying enough without oblivious folks faffing about.", "That\u2019s fair, although my comment doesn\u2019t actually rely on that assumption at all. It stands whether you fly frequently or not, and my point was explained. \n\nSo while I\u2019ll accept a \u201cdickish\u201d label on my comment, I still take issue with low-effort ;)"]}
