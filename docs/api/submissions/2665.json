Theft is theft.", "NTA, but I would also change the password on your account just in case she tries anything", "NTA, at all.  She is taking advantage of you.  Close it.  If she wants to borrow money from you she needs to ask, not just take it.  You're giving her far too much leeway with your money.", "NTA, she has no reason to ***need*** it anymore. Cancel it immediately. If she needs help with finance from you she should ask.

Just cancel the card.   Tell her you cancelled the card because she was being irresponsible with your money.   \n\nAnd stop loaning her money.

There is something wrong, who is the the mother, and who the kid? Your mother must grow up and take on her responsibilities. If you have the money and want to help her, nice of you. She can get a debit card, and you can transfer money. Not that you have to: It usually is the other way round, the parents support the kids, and that does make a lot more sense, because it was their decision to have kids. But even aside from all this: don't give someone free access to your money when they have proven not to be trustworthy.", "NTA \n\nClose it.\n\nYou, or your mom can always get a secured debit card for emergencies, if you choose. That way she has access to emergency funds but those funds do not come from your personal account.", "NTA.  Cancel it.   You told her multiple times, she's not going to stop.

Time to have a frank discussion with your mom that you will no longer be loaning her money and for her to plan accordingly.", "As a former teller, my best advice is to open a new account solely in your own name. Transfer any direct deposits or automatic payments to your new account. This will start building a more accurate picture of your own income and expenses without having to check which card was used for each transaction. If you choose to grant your mom any further financial assistance, you can transfer funds to the old joint account and she can use her debit card to access them. However, I caution against giving her any heads-up about this until it is all set up and your access passwords have all been changed. I have seen vindictive people clear the last funds out even when they previously had never behaved in such manner. You have no obligation to provide any further assistance to her or anyone else. Best of luck!", "Cancel the card or close the account and get one in your name only.", "NTA. She'll be upset, but it's your account and she's using the card inappropriately.", "NTA You need to close that card yesterday. If she needs money and you're obliged to give it to her, you can deposit it in her account or send a Venmo.", "nta. cancel the card", "YTA\n\nOkay wait, didn't she immediately call to let you know the next day? And you snapped at her for keeping you informed? Yes it was late but she's clearly trying and she's also clearly struggling with money or she wouldn't be relying on you like this.\n\nI know money issues are tough, I've had my parents go into my drawers and take my savings without telling me and I found when I went for it later and had big arguments over it, but you have to understand, no good parent WANTS to take their kid's money no matter how old they are.\n\nIt's embarrassing for your mother, she's embarrassed and you're berating her further because you're pissed someone else has access to your money now you don't rely on them for food and house anymore. It's a little fucked up no? Maybe you should reflect. I know it's tough when people don't meet the exact boundaries you've outlaid, but you're also being precious about those boundaries, the boundary which requires your mother to report to you when she has to lean on you for money (which again, embarrassing for an adult woman to do with her kid and she's clearly been made to do it by you more than once) which she is trying her best to meet. I'm not saying you're completely wrong but, before you cut her off from the card and make her actually beg to get the money for groceries and the like, handed from you directly, maybe have some empathy?", "Cancel the debit card. You don\u2019t need to tell her. If she\u2019s trying to check out somewhere & she gets embarrassed bc the old card doesn\u2019t work it\u2019ll be her own fault. You set boundaries. She didn\u2019t /can\u2019t follow them. You must restrict her. NTA.", "NTA but please cancel the card now", "Yeah, not buying that. More like : \"there was no money on my card anymore\" or \"i use yours instead of mine, so i can save money\".", "Oh 100%, I can't imagine just stealing money from my child!", "NTA, but don't tell her you've canceled it. Just tell her not to use it, and see how long it takes.", "NTA. Close it. \n\nAnd how did she have your debit card, but not hers? Does she not keep them in a wallet? How does one forget their own card, but have someone else's? Sounds more like an excuse.", "NTA You would be a fool to let this continue.", "NTA. Your mother is stealing from you. Telling her to stop while she has access to your money is fruitless. Close the account and open another and never give a mooch access to your money. Just because you were too young to know that she would later steal from you is no excuse to continue to let her do it. Let us know what happens when she goes to swipe an invalid debit card.", "If she doesn't have the card, she can't use it and you can set up a bank transfer if you choose to do so. But how the heck did she have your card on hand to pay for groceries and not her own? That doesn't seem accidental...\n\nNTA but I'm glad she paid you back at least", "NTA. Call the bank and get a new one.", "At a new bank or credit union. Seen and heard of too many screwups. Never heard of someone making that mistake at a different bank or credit union. \n\nYou should have done so at 18.", "AFAIK, a second debit card is only given when there is more than 1 person on the account, OP's mom might be able to go to the bank and change back in that case."]}
