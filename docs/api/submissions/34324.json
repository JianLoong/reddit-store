NTA", "No, NTA. But INFO: Does she clean up after herself before she leaves, or are you inspecting private spaces while she's still there? \n\nBecause I'm NGL, I live a bit how you describe her. Clothes tend to be strewn about until the weekend when everything gets washed and put away. When I do my makeup through the week, its all across the counter, and no I'm not taking the time to wait for my curling iron to cool down just so I can roll it up and put it away only to need it again tomorrow morning. Water glasses on the nightstand are a staple. It isn't being dirty, it's not causing damage, it's just being disorganized - in my private spaces. Given a private room to stay in and a private bathroom, I'd probably do the same shit. But I clean up before I leave - the mess is all my own stuff which I would need to take with me, lol.\n\nIf this were a common space you'd be fully 10000% justified, but I'm getting nosy picky vibes from this. Do what you want with who stays in your house, but I couldn't imagine being this level of overbearing to a guest.", "NTA\n\nNo is a vey powerful word. make sure your Husband hears it loud and clear.\n\nTell him she will not be staying.

You are under zero obligation to bring her into your space.\n\nAs has been mentioned though, be prepared for major push back from your partner.  All the housing subsidies/help that you see as enough may be just evidence of his strong tendencies to give his kids whatever they want.", "NAH You need to discuss with your husband the rules she must follow to live there and what happens if she doesn\u2019t abide by them. It\u2019s important you two present a united front. If he doesn\u2019t agree you shouldn\u2019t have that conversation with SD by yourself.

A cordial discussion about respecting your home and keeping things tidy is absolutely fine, though; that's just having respect as a guest for someone else's home.", "Info: who cleans up the house? Is there someone who comes regularly or do you or your husband pick up after her?\n\nAs for advice...is there any chance your husband would agree to hire cleaners while she\u2019s staying there (if you don\u2019t already?) maybe there\u2019s a way to both have her over and not make her mess your problem.", "Your husband needs to have the conversation. It's his child. And he needs to respect your wishes.\n\nThis is not a child. She is well into adulthood. \n\nNTA", "INFO:  Why doesn't SD want to stay in the other house that her siblings are in?  I strongly suspect it's because they are so messy and she wants a 'clean' home.  So I suggest you start your conversation with SD with asking her to explain why she doesn't want to live there.  Then point out how messy she was the last time she stayed in your home (garbage on the floor, messed up bathroom that other people have to use, food and dirty dishes left in the room), remind her that she said she would keep the bedroom/bathroom cleaned and she very much didn't, and that the rules for her bedroom and bathroom would be \"At the end of each day the bedroom needs to look like it did the day you moved in.  All clothes must be put away, no dishes or food in the room, no garbage that can't be contained in the garbage can.  Bathroom needs to have all toiletries and makeup put away and counter/tub must be cleaned.\"  Then ask her \"I have seen your apartment.  How you live there is up to you and I have no issue with how you keep your home.  But given that, do you seriously think you can maintain the level of cleanliness I expect in my home?\"\n\nWhen you say \"Her two siblings live in the same town that we do, in a 3-bedroom house that we also subsidize.\" does that mean you and husband share finances or that you contribute your money to the mortgage on this home as well as the home you live in?  If so, then you and husband BOTH have to agree on SD moving in.  If not, then you have to decide if you want to stay living there yourself.  My main concern is that SD will 'move in for the summer' and at the end of the summer will decide she simply wants to continue living there.  **This will not be for 3 months.**", "NTA. Also no wonder why I struggle so much and see others who don\u2019t and I\u2019m like how do you do it? They don\u2019t. Their family pays for their housing.

And when you say \u201cwe\u201d subsidize the kids\u2019 housing do you really mean her father pays for it? \n\nI am a similar age to your step kids and have friends who hate their step mothers. It has put a sad wedge between them and their fathers. A huge sticking point is not feeling welcome in their own home (your parents home feels like your home even in adulthood, many are living at home into their 30s because of the economy). \n\nChild-free folks often don\u2019t understand that parenting is a forever job. You do what you you can to help your children until the day you die, not until the the kids turn 18. Twenty seven is still a reasonable age to be asking for this kind of support. \n\nIt is totally fair to be stressed about the mess. You husband needs to insist on clean communal spaces. He should clean up after her or hire a maid to do it if she slips.", "For the summer job, come on. You need to lighten up lady. You have step kids part of the package my dear.
