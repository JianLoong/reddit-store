When I do my makeup through the week, its all across the counter, and no I'm not taking the time to wait for my curling iron to cool down just so I can roll it up and put it away only to need it again tomorrow morning. Water glasses on the nightstand are a staple. It isn't being dirty, it's not causing damage, it's just being disorganized - in my private spaces. Given a private room to stay in and a private bathroom, I'd probably do the same shit.

I strongly suspect it's because they are so messy and she wants a 'clean' home.  So I suggest you start your conversation with SD with asking her to explain why she doesn't want to live there.  Then point out how messy she was the last time she stayed in your home (garbage on the floor, messed up bathroom that other people have to use, food and dirty dishes left in the room), remind her that she said she would keep the bedroom/bathroom cleaned and she very much didn't, and that the rules for her bedroom and bathroom would be \"At the end of each day the bedroom needs to look like it did the day you moved in.  All clothes must be put away, no dishes or food in the room, no garbage that can't be contained in the garbage can.  Bathroom needs to have all toiletries and makeup put away and counter/tub must be cleaned.\"  Then ask her \"I have seen your apartment.  How you live there is up to you and I have no issue with how you keep your home.  But given that, do you seriously think you can maintain the level of cleanliness I expect in my home?\"\n\nWhen you say \"Her two siblings live in the same town that we do, in a 3-bedroom house that we also subsidize.\" does that mean you and husband share finances or that you contribute your money to the mortgage on this home as well as the home you live in?  If so, then you and husband BOTH have to agree on SD moving in.  If not, then you have to decide if you want to stay living there yourself.

I don't even understand how that can happen!\n\nYou mean someone visiting doesn't spend their holiday keeping the bedroom clean? the horror.\n\nYou don't mention her leaving it like that so I can only assume that like that while she's there.\n\n>So how do I have the conversation with the SD about my expectations if she stays with us?\n\nYou need to understand that you don't get to have many expectations about the guest bedroom while it is in use by a guest.", "Why are you going in to the guest room when she's staying? What an invasion of privacy. As long as she's not damaging the house your being incredibly selfish and ridiculous. \nI'd be fuming if at her age I learnt my stepmum was going In my room and looking at my clothes etc.", "Keep the bedroom door closed. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done with my parents when I have to stay there or when we\u2019re traveling. I have things all over the place, but they never have to look at it. All common spaces are fine. I will say though there\u2019s no food or things like that that could attract bugs. It\u2019s just clothes, books, papers, etc\u2026", "So she married the husband knowing he had kids and now wants to ignore the kids. Got it", "Thank you for your comments - they are probably some of the most helpful this far. The other problem that her being here for the whole summer creates, is then there is no space for other visitors - my brother and family cannot stay with us, my Dad and GF, my out of town friends.... I would feel embarrassed if they had to share a bathroom with her. But perhaps I can use some of your points and hope that she would perhaps show more courtesy if others were here as well.", "This isnt a guest it's their kids. When you marry a parent their kids become your kids. Like fuck", "I accept the kids, 100%... it is the behaviour that I don't feel I need to put up with. My parents did not allow me and my siblings to behave like that, especially not in someone else's space. The element of disrespect is hard to take as well, and that is not only towards me but her father as well - it is his house too.", "Yes, I am starting to realize that he spent many years - crucial years in the kids' lives - divorce-guilt parenting. I am overwhelmed by all of the comments, and appreciative at the same time. I am going to work hard to get my husband to have a conversation and set clear expectations, so that there is much less stress and the summer can be enjoyed by all of us.", "Thank you, I am now in the spot that if a summer job in our area does pan out for her, and she asks to live with us, I will be arranging a meeting with all of us in the room to kindly lay out some expectations. As for trying to keep them from their Dad? Mostly it is quite the opposite.... I invite them regularly to our house for suppers, games, etc.., and I (not their Dad) make suggestions and plans for all of them to join us in many other activities (skating, skiing, concerts, vacations)..... I would like nothing more than to be that cool step-mom who the stepkids can count on, hence why I have been (what I thought was) generous in contributing to very nice housing for all of them. I have never missed a birthday or Christmas or other special occasion of theirs. This is mostly a matter of me not feeling like having a roommate who is excessively messy. And I expect more from someone who is 27 - their Dad should too.", "Okay I don't think you've read all of my replies.... I do NOT go into the room - she leaves the door open and it is clearly visible from the common area of our basement where our TV is. The bathroom is a common bathroom, and if you don't have a problem with dirty underwear left on the floor, and makeup mashed into the rug, and toothpaste spattered on the mirror, personal garbage on the floor, etc... then perhaps you wouldn't mind her as a roommate. She is 27, not 7. I would never live like that at my parents or in-laws place.", "You said \"we are contributing\" to the other 2's living arrangement. Just pull out your contribution if your husband doesn't fold.", "Is it possible for her to keep the bedroom door closed? I'm a naturally messy person & my parents' rule, even when I was living with them as an adult, was to keep the common areas neat (this would include the bathroom, within reason) and to keep my bedroom door shut so they didn't have to see it. There was no food allowed upstairs where the bedrooms were, so that was never an issue.\n\nI say within reason for the bathroom b/c some makeup on the counter would be neatened enough, but the underwear and such is unacceptable; like not perfectly set, but not a stye.", "It\u2019s two yeses and one no. If one person veto\u2019s it it\u2019s an automatic No. You don\u2019t even have to explain yourself why you don\u2019t want her there, it\u2019s your home and you deserve to have it just like you want it.", "Hopefully it will lead to divorce.", "No.  She doesn't want a disgusting slob living in her house.  There are various ways this problem could be solved - for example, husband could make daughter clean up after herself, or he could clean up after his spawn every day, or he can hire someone to do that.", "And if you regularly host other guests, that's a valid point if there are no other rooms for guests.\n\nI think on paper, this is all solvable. I also don't think it is unreasonable for someone's son or daughter to stay with them for a period of time like this in similar circumstances. I'm sure there are many people like your husband who would welcome the opportunity to have their kids live with them again (at least for a short stint).\n\nThe issue is that people get emotional, or can't articulate the why and the how easily. Everyone involved needs to act like the adults that they are.\n\nI think an important part of this is that you or your husband need to explain why these rules are important to you, and I mean you as a couple. Your husband needs to be on your side here.", "Given your other descriptions I servery doubts its \"overflowing\" you seem like an unreliable narrator.\n\nYou strike me as the kind of A-type AH that would get annoyed with dishes being left in the sink rather than immediately washed and rinsed.", "What are you going to do when there are grandkids? Not let them stay over?", "They're not standard visitors, my parents have always insisted I treat their home like it was my own.", "With all that helping, it really shouldn\u2019t be about your clean house. I think you may have a husband problem.", "Yes I would love to be able to have those types of rules or understanding... taking food into the bedroom makes me cringe, as I have had to scrub cheeto dust out of the rug, and try to stain-remove hot sauce from the bed covers (after she has gone of course). Her Dad says that he will set those boundaries, but he has yet to talk to her.... this kind of stuff has been happening every time she visits.... and in order to keep the peace with the kids, I argue with their Dad about it instead.", "I do not go into the room, but when the door is wide open (to the common area of the basement where our TV is) it is hard not to notice.", "Nothing I read show the stepdaughter as a slob.", "'Unreliable narrator'.... I don't even know what that means? I am describing the space IN MY HOME how it is maintained when she is here. And you bet dishes in the sink irritate me.... the dishwasher is less than 18\" away, so put them in there for gawd sake. \ud83d\ude1c", "I\u2019m 37 and in the US. I moved back in with my mom for a few years in my late 20\u2019s, but she was in no way obligated to house me and I also cleaned the house every week which was a requirement of my moving in. If this woman wasn\u2019t a gross slob with an apartment already bought for her it would be a different situation.", "Grandkids will be great! I have no problem when my nieces and nephews visited me when they were small.... they were all about 'Auntie's house, Auntie's rules'.... plus I would be able to help coach the grandkids and teach them better manners and habits than their mother.... LOL.... truth be known, all of the stepkids have expressed that they are not interested in having their own kids, so I am fairly confident I won't be a step-Grammy.", "Oof. That sounds like a very difficult situation. The only thing I can think of is insisting that you both sit down with her (or zoom or whatever) to discuss the conditions of her living with you for the summer. Other commenters ointed out she can get a summer job near where she lives now, which makes the most sense to me assuming there are equal-ish financial opportunities (rural vs city, low-income area vs ritzy area).", "She has an apartment that is being paid for and a summer job. She can live with her siblings in the home their parents also pay for, or she can sublet somewhere for the summer.", ">plus I would be able to help coach the grandkids and teach them better manners and habits than their mother\n\nAH confirmed.\n\nyou need to STFU and stay in your lane.", "No need to be so rude!   I was raised to work hard and look after my belongings, and I would never dream of not taking good care of someone else's space when I was visiting them - my parents house or otherwise."]}
