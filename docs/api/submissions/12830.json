Also, no one can just dump their kid on you if your not willing to help. The word No exists & there are agencies that can intervene to ensure this kid is safe. \n\nSIL\u2019s previous relationship & arrangement with with her family has almost nothing to do with you. If your wife & MIL don\u2019t want to care for the kid, then they need to let his Mom know that & she will need to find other arrangements. I understand that SIL may never allow you to see the kid again but if she wants to choose that path then let her. \n\nIf the adults are unwilling to help the kid because his Mom is an ah... sorry but that makes y\u2019all bigger assholes. 5 yr old did nothing to cause this problem. He shouldn\u2019t be punished because his mom doesn\u2019t have her shit together.\n\neta \u2014 based on your comments & more information YTA. Your judging your SIL on past behavior & none of it has affected you. Believe it or not people can grow up & change.

You can\u2019t decide for your MIL what she should do (or how much she\u2019s owed for babysitting) & your SIL\u2019s relationship with her family has nothing to do with you.

It\u2019s what they do. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to care for the kid or deal with SIL you may want to re-think MIL living with you. It\u2019s appears your biggest issue is with the fact that your MIL will be living with you now & still caring for SIL kid. You should\u2019ve thought of that before you asked her to move in with you.
