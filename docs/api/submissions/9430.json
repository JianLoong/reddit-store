It's unreasonable to expect one's partner to never notice attention from other people. Of course it's nice. If you start thinking \"Gee, I wish I could do something about it...\" that's when you have a problem. But that isn't the case, and in fact you felt comfortable enough about it to tell your wife about it. \n\nOf course there are other things that aren't mentioned...have you been married long, has your wife been insecure in the past, have you cheated, etc. Maybe none of that is true, but you should look @ this in the context of your relationship.", "NAH it sounds like it\u2019s just harmless jealousy rather than anything to be worried about", "NTA, I don't see why this would be a big deal unless you're having intimacy issues, then I'd maybe understand why it hit a nerve with her? I love it when my partner gets attention, if it makes her feel good/attractive! That's how I want her to feel.", "YTA.  I\u2019m missing the part why you thought it\u2019d be a funny conversation? \u201cHey. These 2 girls hit on me and it was an ego boost.\u201d. Where\u2019s the haha?", "NTA but she's teaching you to withhold information with her current behavior.", "YTA. Oversharing is garbage. What were you trying to achieve? And you had indeed \u201cobviously thought about it\u201d.", "YTA sounds like you also like to make her jealous. What was your point in telling her? Don\u2019t you have friends you can laugh about your story with? Read the room, she is your wife. You already knew how she\u2019d respond. If you truly had no idea how she would respond, there is the problem and the real reason she is mad at you.", "Ehhh yeah I think your SO getting mad about something as petty as \u2018two women passing by gave me an ego boost\u2019 is weird. But I also think it\u2019s a weird thing to bring up in the first place. My SO\u2019s not the jealous type at all but when I get hit on, I don\u2019t feel the need to bring it to him. For what? To make him feel jealous? Brag to him I still got it? Just seems like an immature conversation. Also I don\u2019t know the exact language used in this conversation but she might have not gotten mad if you were a bit more tactful in telling her about this ego boost. You can be honest about liking the attention while also making your partner feel valued and special.", "NTA from the info listed.\n\nMost people like being acknowledged there are attractive (depending upon how it's portrayed) and you were honest and open about it with her, this is something she should have had a laugh over with you.\n\nOnce things are not quite as tense might want to get to the root of why she reacted as she did.", "I don't think so.

I think there\u2019s more to this story.", "NTA- She feels threatened, you can still turn a woman's head. As she gets older she is afraid that you may seek the attention from those younger women.", "NTA\n\nThat is a perfectly normal reaction to members of the opposite sex giving you attention. Although, it's probably not the best course of action to tell your wife about it. That said, her reaction was ridiculous. Like she wouldn't be happy that someone paid her a compliment. I don't know a human on earth that doesn't like an ego boost every now and then.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Moderate success, I suppose, but not 100%.", "I am wondering she actually does give attention that gives him an ego boost. I mean in general men are starved of praise and encouragement by society.

No infidelity on either of our parts.  I always thought she was mildly insecure in our relationship and definitely jealous, but overall she is a logical thinker and good woman.", "Same here!  My wife is hot; I know she gets hit on a lot.  But I know her heart is mine, as mine is hers.  I think where I effed up, and you can find it in the comments, is we're going through IVF and because sometimes I don't think before speaking, I didn't consider that in this time, it might have been better to just not say anything. \n\nWe don't have intimacy issues beyond the IVF.  It leaves her hormonal, ill, and often physically in pain.  So it's not a lack of want for each other, just extenuating circumstances.", "Seriously?   My husband is fine as fuck but he doesn't think so. \n\nHe always tells me if he thought someone was nice to him, of course he's fine.

Have there been any issues with jealousy/insecurity/infidelity in the past that this might be playing into, or that might be triggering her reaction?", "Not gonna lie, that comment and way of thinking is so not helpful. Sure ,maybe there is some insecurity playing a part here, or maybe she is just territorial, but your reaction of \u201cyour just teaching me to hide things from you\u201d isn\u2019t going to help her work through that. You could just end up making it worse which could cause further issues later. She (or you for that matter) should never have to wonder if your spouse is keeping secrets, and it\u2019s not cool to plant that seed. \n\nYou shared your feelings that it made you feel good to get that (from your description, very mild) attention from other women, and she didn\u2019t like it.  She has every right to express her honest feelings (just as you say you were doing in the last sentence of your post).  Even in your own words (in another comment), you described her reaction as \u201csalty\u201d rather than blowing up. That doesn\u2019t sound like an overreaction, just a conversation not going you the way you hoped.", "No, never any infidelity.  Jealous, yes; insecure, maybe a little.  This, in my mind puts the insecurity up a notch though.  I really felt sidelined and shocked at her reaction to what was, in my mind, harmless and funny.  I thought she'd do some playful jealous bit like grab me and say I belong to her, then I'd say forever and ever..  But no.", "Thanks for the feedback.  You're right that there should not even be a suspicion of secrets.  We've just always had a very open relationship.  I just didn't think there was something wrong with the way it made me feel and she said if it made me feel good then I must want more.  Obviously I never have wanted anyone else but I didn't think I was weird for feeling the way I did.", "> thought she'd do some playful jealous bit like grab me and say I belong to her, then I'd say forever and ever..  But no.\n\nYeah this is the type of response I'd usually expect too. Have there been any changes lately to either of your health or physique, work stress, or anything else that might have exacerbated things?", "Her comment is over the line. That's not ok to shame your feelings. Of course it feels good. That doesn't mean we need or want more. \n\nTalk to her because this isn't ok behavior no matter what her hormones are doing.", "We're going through IVF.  If I were a smarter man I would have thought it through more considering her hormones are about 9,750 higher than normal.  I don't know what hormone they measure but it's typically 10-50.  Hers is hovering around 9,800.", "After reading many of the comments here (even the disparaging ones) and digesting that, I talked to her earnestly and told her there's nothing that could ever persuade me to jeopardize our relationship but that if we were to keep our open, honest relationship, then my feelings should be acknowledged and not shame me. \n\nI think we're good now.  I had little doubt we would be but still.", "I appreciate your transparency In your comments, I really do, but man they are not helping your case \ud83d\ude02. I  could only make assumption to the \u201creason\u201d you guys have to go the IVF route and that\u2019s not my business. However, if by chance your infertility journey is female factor infertility, can you not empathize as to why she might me sensitive to you getting ANY outside female attention, no matter how small. And be clear, I\u2019m only including the psychological and emotional reasons for these insecurities and feelings, not the hormonal reasons (which of course may also play a part). If she is already feeling any sort of inadequacy toward her body or herself as a woman due to her infertility journey (again going of the total assumption that it\u2019s female factor), I\u2019m sure the last thing she needs to hear is how you had an ego boost from other women flirting with you. \n\nAgain, I stand by my comment that statements like \u201cyour incentivizing me to hide things\u201d isn\u2019t helpful, but some self awareness to your specific situation is key, man.", "Damn...  Maybe I should have posted this in r/facepalm or even better, r/tifu\n\nI think from everyone's feedback, maybe I'm not an asshole, but I'm definitely an idiot. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nEdit:  and just so we're clear, that is the type of transparency I have with everyone.

Honest to a fault.", "I feel like you\u2019ve been the most engaged, thoughtful and responsive aita OP I\u2019ve ever seen - all the best for you and your lady friend!", "I came with an open mind for honest opinions from the community.  99% were respectful even if they thought I was the asshole.  I came away understanding my wife's position more, how I may have been insensitive considering the other factors despite never having that intention.
