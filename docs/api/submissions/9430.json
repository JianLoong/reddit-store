To make him feel jealous? Brag to him I still got it? Just seems like an immature conversation.

Have there been any issues with jealousy/insecurity/infidelity in the past that this might be playing into, or that might be triggering her reaction?", "Not gonna lie, that comment and way of thinking is so not helpful. Sure ,maybe there is some insecurity playing a part here, or maybe she is just territorial, but your reaction of \u201cyour just teaching me to hide things from you\u201d isn\u2019t going to help her work through that. You could just end up making it worse which could cause further issues later. She (or you for that matter) should never have to wonder if your spouse is keeping secrets, and it\u2019s not cool to plant that seed. \n\nYou shared your feelings that it made you feel good to get that (from your description, very mild) attention from other women, and she didn\u2019t like it.  She has every right to express her honest feelings (just as you say you were doing in the last sentence of your post).  Even in your own words (in another comment), you described her reaction as \u201csalty\u201d rather than blowing up. That doesn\u2019t sound like an overreaction, just a conversation not going you the way you hoped.", "No, never any infidelity.  Jealous, yes; insecure, maybe a little.  This, in my mind puts the insecurity up a notch though.  I really felt sidelined and shocked at her reaction to what was, in my mind, harmless and funny.  I thought she'd do some playful jealous bit like grab me and say I belong to her, then I'd say forever and ever..  But no.", "Thanks for the feedback.  You're right that there should not even be a suspicion of secrets.  We've just always had a very open relationship.  I just didn't think there was something wrong with the way it made me feel and she said if it made me feel good then I must want more.  Obviously I never have wanted anyone else but I didn't think I was weird for feeling the way I did.", "> thought she'd do some playful jealous bit like grab me and say I belong to her, then I'd say forever and ever..

That's not ok to shame your feelings. Of course it feels good. That doesn't mean we need or want more. \n\nTalk to her because this isn't ok behavior no matter what her hormones are doing.", "We're going through IVF.  If I were a smarter man I would have thought it through more considering her hormones are about 9,750 higher than normal.  I don't know what hormone they measure but it's typically 10-50.  Hers is hovering around 9,800.", "After reading many of the comments here (even the disparaging ones) and digesting that, I talked to her earnestly and told her there's nothing that could ever persuade me to jeopardize our relationship but that if we were to keep our open, honest relationship, then my feelings should be acknowledged and not shame me. \n\nI think we're good now.  I had little doubt we would be but still.", "I appreciate your transparency In your comments, I really do, but man they are not helping your case \ud83d\ude02. I  could only make assumption to the \u201creason\u201d you guys have to go the IVF route and that\u2019s not my business. However, if by chance your infertility journey is female factor infertility, can you not empathize as to why she might me sensitive to you getting ANY outside female attention, no matter how small. And be clear, I\u2019m only including the psychological and emotional reasons for these insecurities and feelings, not the hormonal reasons (which of course may also play a part). If she is already feeling any sort of inadequacy toward her body or herself as a woman due to her infertility journey (again going of the total assumption that it\u2019s female factor), I\u2019m sure the last thing she needs to hear is how you had an ego boost from other women flirting with you. \n\nAgain, I stand by my comment that statements like \u201cyour incentivizing me to hide things\u201d isn\u2019t helpful, but some self awareness to your specific situation is key, man.", "Damn...

Some things are better left unsaid. \n\nI also wonder what your motivation truly was sharing this story, maybe a thin veiled attempt to let your wife know you need attention that she isn't giving. If that's the case, it wasn't a good way to ask for it and could have been seen as manipulative.\n\nIf not, you are still an idiot for opening your mouth, lol.", "I also wonder if OP mentioned ages of these women- if they are a bit younger, especially with the IVF process, it may have hit a nerve.", "Or she could be a big girl and *do* something to give op an ego boost.", "I have no idea their ages.

I've never had complaints with our relationship regarding feelings, sex, etc.", "[deleted]", "Hmm, maybe subconsciously she has been blaming herself for any fertility issues and equates carrying children easily with her worth as a partner to you.

My wife loves me infinitely, even with my many, many faults.  She knows I have a good heart, mean well, and put her first in everything. \n\nThat said, I can see where the other guy is coming from.  I was starved of attention, feeling, sex, everything that makes a good marriage in my first marriage.  I endured that one for 12 years before filing for divorce.", "Thank you!  I think you and others are correct.  I didn't read the room, so to speak, when I said it.  It'll all work out, for sure. We love each other dearly.

You think you could talk to your person about this. Not sure why this upset her so bad? Maybe sit down and ask her seriously and calmly. Tell her you didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feelings or anything. You just found it amusing because you\u2019re married but you were coming home to HER. ALWAYS to her :) I\u2019d honestly be proud someone else was checking out my husband Hahaha", "NTA. I'm extremely jealous and it would definitely sting to know someone's hitting on my husband but it's natural to feel good about yourself after such thing happens and I don't think it's bad that you shared with your wife. She's your closest person I presume, so it's normal to tell her interesting things about your day,especially since I assume men get hit on far less often than women.", "lol NTA but i got a solid giggle out of the \"oops\" commentary below.", "I feel me and my husband share a similar relationship to you and your wife (or at least how it sounds from what I've read)\n\nwe're super honest with each other, and he has told me a million times about girls that flirt with him and things like that and how it makes him feel good. I just make a joke about it or call them wh\\*res or something crude like that, and we have a laugh.\n\nI don't get upset because I know that after a certain age it makes you feel good to still be considered attractive by someone besides your partner, it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean you're planning on cheating, it doesn't mean you regret choosing who you're with, and that goes for both of us.\n\nSo NTA and continue being honest!", "NTA. Your wife is being extremely insecure. I understand telling her made sense because you thought it was a funny story. But now that you know your wife gets irrationally jealous it might be best to keep these kinds of innocuous interactions to yourself.\n\nThere are two kinds of people. People that want you to be honest (Of course I enjoyed a little attention from random women) and people who want you to lie. (Ew, any woman looking at me who isn't my wife disgusts me.)", "Everyone needs a little ego boost from time to time and my boyfriend and i are always laughing together about situations like these and tell each other about it. In a sense of \u201eguess what happened today\u201c \nIts healthy to be able to talk about those things without the other one getting insecure", "Kind of a shit take when all the other girls had to do was exist and give him some attention to boost his ego. She exists and gives him attention every day lol (assumedly)", "Would that have been your reaction if it was her saying she enjoyed being the object of two guys attentions?", "Your feelings aren\u2019t wrong, I just don\u2019t see the point in telling her every feeling you have. You said multiple times in your responses that she is jealous, so you knew that already. You knew she wasn\u2019t going to laugh and think it was funny.\n\nMy ex was jealous too. I knew if I told him I turned a head, he didn\u2019t want to hear it. If I told him, I knew I was intentionally hurting him. That\u2019s what he taught me about himself. It didn\u2019t mean I withheld everything going forward, it meant I was selective out of care for his feelings. \nIf you know she is jealous, you are saying you know that telling her hurts her. So why hurt her on purpose? What do you gain? Before speaking ask yourself if what you are saying is kind or necessary.\n\nTransparency and honesty are important, and so is integrity. I expect my partner to act with integrity, meaning be an honorable and trustworthy person behind my back when nobody is looking. I believe you have integrity, so your sharing was a lesson in not saying something unnecessarily. Don\u2019t guilt her by saying you will withhold now, it is her right to not have to listen to every time you get your ego stroked because you feel compelled to be transparent. She told you how it made her feel. And you are telling her that if she doesn\u2019t allow you to keep making her jealous then you will stop sharing with her? Put the shovel down dude.", "NTA OP. I went through IVF to conceive all my kids though so for sure the hormones could be affecting her response here plus the knowledge that she knows statistically it\u2019s quite probable it may not work with her own eggs given her age, makes sense she would get a little salty."]}
