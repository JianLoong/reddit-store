We started as gymbros, and eventually, we began dating.\n\n4 months into our relationship, Aiden would come over to my apartment and stay over on an irregular but somewhat consistent basis, and I always had a hot meal prepared for him, especially when he\u2019s had a long day at work.\n\nAiden invited me to his home because he wanted me to meet his close friends, who are also his roommates \u2013 we\u2019ll call them Ricky, Miguel and Juan. The rest of the night went smoothly, I met his friends and the girls they had over. They\u2019re cool dudes, but I'm pretty sure they\u2019re all fuck boys \u2014 funny enough, they all come from wealthy backgrounds, including Aiden.\n\nFor the next two weeks, I began visiting Aiden\u2019s home and staying the night regularly. And, of course, I was cooking for him. One night I was cooking for Aiden, then Ricky and Miguel asked me if I made enough for them, I thought they were joking when they asked me that, so I playfully said \u201cNah.\u201d I quickly found out they weren\u2019t joking when Ricky said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d in a serious tone, and Miguel cosigned it by saying, \u201cDeadass.\u201d My response was, \u201cI\u2019m not in a relationship with any of you,\u201d then out of nowhere, Juan chimed in, saying, \u201cBro, that doesn\u2019t mean shit, Aiden isn\u2019t the only person that lives here.\u201d Ricky told me that if I was going to cook, I had to cook for everybody. When Aiden came home and got settled in, I told him what happened and he told me that he\u2019ll handle it.\n\nSo the next time I cooked for Aiden, I thought there wouldn\u2019t be another issue, \nI thought wrong. When I came from the kitchen with only one plate, his friends went nuts. Ricky immediately pounced and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re still are going to cook for one person?\u201d I snapped and said, \u201cBruh, if you want someone to cook for y\u2019all so bad, then why don\u2019t the three of you have all the females that walk bare ass through your hallways do it for y\u2019all.\u201d Some hours went by, and they somehow got Aiden to fold because he pleaded with me that the next time, I cooked something to make sure there was enough for his friends to get at least a little bit. I reluctantly agreed and the next two times I cooked, I made sure it was enough for his friends.\n\nThey got really comfortable with me cooking for them, too comfortable for my liking. I was sitting in the living room one day and Ricky was also present. We sat in silence until Juan and Miguel, but then, out of nowhere, Juan said, \u201cI\u2019m hungry, I haven\u2019t ate all day,\u201d and when I looked up from my phone, they\u2019re all staring at me and Ricky says \u201cAiden bro, go make us something to eat.\u201d So, in response, I simply got up and left and I texted Aiden and told him from now on, we\u2019re spending time at my place only.\n\nWhen I told my friends what\u2019s been going on, they sided with Aiden\u2019s friends, saying that I was a stranger in their home and cooking almost every time I was there and not offering anything is disrespectful.

But I agree on ESH, because it seems there might be some kind of house rule that one person cooks for all? But the housemates suck for demanding food & being generally rude.", "Wait, but Aiden wants you waiting at his place with hot meal? Tbh, that sits oddly with me - his friends are definitely entitled and rude, but are you comfortable with his expectations there?", "that is certainly good to hear.", "Smh over food. Those guys are jerks and have serious issues.", "Well you are young.  People don't like it when other people use their kitchen.  Not the food in it but the kitchen.  Unless they are making food for them.  It is a real thing.  Not everyone. Is like that but a lot of people are. \n\nWe used to have au pairs that lived in our house, drove our cars, took care of our kids.  We are still very close to them.  If they had friends over they would cook together.  I can't remember once in 15  years that their friend cooked alone in the kitchen for the au pair.  For themselves, yes, but more usually they were together or the au pair cooks for the friend. \n\nProbably because if something breaks or goes wrong you want the person that lives there to deal with it.  \n\nI dont think you did anything wrong.  I just hope you learned something, stay out of your bfs kitchen unless he has his own place.", "Word choice matters mate. Of all the adjectives you could have chosen to describe the flatmate's guests you chose \"bare arsed\". In a different comment you mention that these would not be women to take home to meet the parents.\n\nYour negative opinion of these women is shown by your description of them. And as far as this post goes, the only thing they have done wrong is spend the night with people you don't like.\n\nYou may be reporting what you saw but we are informing you that the lens you are looking through needs realignment.", "It\u2019s not. OP seems to think that if they were to get anyone to cook for them it should be the womenfolk", "Let me know when you found out, because I\u2019ve said females so many times to women and none of them got ever mad at me, so\u2026\u2026", "You\u2019re not redeeming yourself here", "Judgy much", "But that is the boyfriends place\u2026 that\u2019s kind of how shared living usually works, and the comparison doesn\u2019t really work here since I doubt your live in help was also on the lease. If OP wants to cook for just their boyfriend in their boyfriends kitchen, as long as they clean everything up what is the problem here ?", ">Word choice matters mate.

In a different comment you mention that these would not be women to take home to meet the parents.\n\nEverything I said about those women is true. If you don\u2019t like my description of their behavior, that\u2019s a-okay. \n\n>Your negative opinion of these women is shown by your description of them. And as far as this post goes, the only thing they have done wrong is spend the night with people you don't like.\n\nDid you read the comment I was responding? It absolutely nothing to do with what you\u2019re rambling about.\n\n>You may be reporting what you saw but we are informing you that the lens you are looking through needs realignment.\n\nMy lens perfectly fine, you seem to believe it needs \u201crealignment\u201d because doesn\u2019t line up to what believe to be acceptable behavior from women, or how you believe criticism should be levied against women. Not my problem.", "I think you might be a little slow. They should know how to cook for themselves, but if they expect someone to cook for them, it should be the people they\u2019re having some form of a sexual or romantic relationship(s) with that they\u2019re bringing home. Explain to me what\u2019s misogynistic about that? Because I\u2019m really confused\u2026.", "You're overthinking it", "I see it a lot online. Never heard talk about it irl either. I'm a woman and a native english speaker and I don't really understand why women is ok and females isn't. They're basically synonyms of each other.", "Not trying to. I\u2019m just reporting what I saw, if you\u2019re okay with women walking around bare ass in a house with mostly men present, that says more about you than it does about me.", "Back in the day when I lived with a roommate my bf didn't use the kitchen and neither did her friends.  Maybe I am the weird one.  I am territorial with the kitchen.", "How you put it is misogynistic. How do you not see that? You judged and insulted the women rather than basically telling the men to (preferably) to cook for themselves or telling them to look at someone they actually have a relationship with.\n\nYou had zero tact here.", "It\u2019s really quite transparent in their attitude", "That\u2019s my exact line of thought. So I didn\u2019t somebody would express discontent with the female, the internet is a weird place.", "Awh sweetie. \n\nDo you say the same about the guys walking around with their tops off?", ">How do you not see that?\n\nExcuse me, for not seeing misogyny in my line of thought and wording that had nothing to do with misogyny.\n\n>You judged and insulted the women rather than basically telling the men to (preferably) to cook for themselves or telling them to look at someone they actually have a relationship with.\n\nI did the latter. However, I use adjectives you didn\u2019t like. \n\n>You had zero tact here.\n\nJust curious, If I described the men in the house the same as I did the women would you be accusing me of misandry?\n\nMoreover, I called them Aiden\u2019s friends fucking boys with actually getting to know the first night I met them, where you comment accusing of me misandry? Just curious\u2026.", "Yes, I do pumpkin pie."]}
