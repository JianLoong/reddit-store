Our family owned a big cottage and a forest near it for at least 200 years and it has Always been passed down. Currently it's owned by my father and my aunt. The cottage desperatly needed a new roof (the old one was literally falling apart at this point). So my father worked his ass off to make enough money for it. Him, me and my brother (19M) spent every. single. weekend. In the forest cutting/getting out the wood so we could sell it. We agreed with my aunt that she'll give us half the money we'll need. Well, the time came and we FINALLY got enough money. We called our aunt over and told her the amount of money we'll need - 47,000 USD (So that's 23,500 usd from her). She said that there's no way she can get her hands on that much money. My father told her that it's okay. That she can give us the money she spared. We actually did save up the full 47,000 because we thought we would use the extra money to renovate a little. She ended up giving us NOTHING. Not. a. Single. Penny... All was good until i found out that she went on 6 holidays (all international) with her 2 childern (4m, 11f) in the next 2 months and is going to Paris next week. Yesterday we met again and i was PISSED. We spent our whole summer and a year prior working our asses off. And She had the audacity to say something in the lines of \"That colour could have been better\" when She first saw the new roof. I lost it. I screamed  something like \"Oh i'm sorry you don't like it. Maybe if you gave us some of the money you promised, you'd get to choose the colour. This Is our family's legacy, but you don't even care enough to spare a few damn bucks. You're not my family anymore.\" I'm usually pretty collected And calm, So hearing me yell visibly scared the f outta her.

Enjoy the silence.", "This one might be controversial but ESH. Yes, your aunt should have paid her share but it's not up to you or your father to dictate her financial priorities. It's also not up to you to get in the middle of an argument between the people who actually own the cottage.", "Info: does she work? How long before you started renovating did you talk to her about the money. And if she works how much does she make?", "NTA for your feelings about the situation. I can't even really fault you for how you reacted. But I think it's best for your father to deal with your aunt.", "NTA. Screaming was probably out of line and your aunt and uncle won't probably speak to you and *will* see you as the asshole. Is your dad on your side, or was the yelling just 'out of nowhere'?

Sorry to say this, because you are young. But for most normal people, 23,500 dollars is a lot of money and it needs much more notice than you gave her now.  Vacations are also usually planned in advance - months, sometimes even a year. \n\nYour father does understand and he said it's okay. It is not your job to question both your father and your aunt about this. Mind your own business.", "I think you\u2019re NTA for your efforts in supporting the family in getting the roof done, which sounds like incredibly hard work for all of you.  You ATA for yelling, that\u2019s not constructive (my daughter at your age would have been quite vocal if she felt there was a perceived injustice, do you think that played into your reaction?).  You\u2019re also NTA for getting a grasp on quite a complex situation (not saying that you fully understand all of the complexities yet, but NTA nonetheless).", "NTA  - if she owns 50% of the cottage, that is how much of the renovation costs she should technically pay. It sounds like you guys were empathetic about the fact that she might have different financial pressures, and would be happy with any contributions she could make.

I would have blown a gasket too", "ESH", "YTA- the roof renovation and its financing is a matter to be dealt with by the owners, so your dad and his sister. Even if they were not able to deal with it properly, it's still their circus. You were brought into this situation by your dad and doing the work, I assume, because he asked you.  If you have a gripe with someone,  it should be with your dad, who didn't negotiate this properly with sister. Otherwise you need to butt out.  It's really not your circus.

There definetly should've been more communication...", "She said she'd help then backed out entirely and bitched about the color. It's not her responsibility but them she can shut her mouth", "Nah nah nah, if you're a co owner, you have the responsibility to pay your part for upkeep. If she didnt have the money it would be a different story, but Auntie wants the reward without any of the work", "Fair enough tbh", "I mean yeah, but also it's her cottage as well. Other replies from the OP say that the aunt uses the cottage just as much as they do. So I think that she sould pay as much as they do.", "Yes, She does. She knew about it basically the moment we knew. We told her about all the money needed like a year before the renovation. I'm not sure about her income. She's only able to work part time since she's disabled (spinal injury, She's in a wheelchair), but her husband makes really good money, he's some kind of a scientist.", "My dad is also angry at his Sisters, but he usually stays quiet about it. My father and his sister had a long conversation after what i said to her. My dad said that they'll figure it out.\n\nAnd yeah, She has parties there, invites friends over And stuff...", "Yeah, I agree. I definetly wasn't supposed to yell, I just Couldn't stop myself. But yeah, i think you might be right. My dad was always working and i didn't see him as much and my aunt would just get away with not even trying...", "I'm So sorry if it wasn't written right. But She knew about it all like a year prior And agreed", "You also say that it\u2019s your family legacy\u2026 but is that how she feels? I work in the funeral industry, and 100% of the time people say the legacy of the deceased was the family they leave behind\u2026 not material possessions.\nIt might feel to you like this house is a legacy, but your aunt may not place the same importance on it.", "I\u2019m a little confused. It sounds like your part of the money came from cutting and selling the trees on the property. If so, you could have charged for the labor, but the trees were an asset to the property and were sold. Was this all discussed?", "Don\u2019t forget to take the positives as well as the one small negative, don\u2019t beat yourself up, you put a lot of effort into that roof!", "I genuinly think she loves this place, but you have a point...", "It\u2019s a house her family has owned for 200 years. That sounds like a family legacy to me.", "Sooo the trees were basically all dead anyways. There was an \"epidemic\" of bark beetles in our country in the 2020. Basically All the labor was Done by my father, me And my Brother. I am not sure if that's what u mean, sorryyyy", "Thank you! I'm just glad that it's done. This way we won't have to deal with it for at least 100 years, So me And potentionally my kids won't have to do what my father had to... I love my dad, but He had to sacrifice some valuable time with his Kids for that roof...", "You guys should probably start saving up to buy out her half, though, just in case she ever decides she'd rather have the money than the cottage.", "You can love a place and still not have it as your financial priority. Furthermore, making changes to it might be upsetting for her if it does hold a lot of sentimental value which could also explain her comment about the colour?", "So to clarify- your portion of the cash needed came from selling the trees on the property? The property your aunt also owns? Does she know that you did this, and that this is where your portion came from?", "Good point, but i'm pretty sure she wouldn't do that. She loves this place and even if She didn't, She knows that if She Sells it, her parents And my dad Will cut her off completly...", "Yeah, i Guess so... thanks, this Is pretty interesting to hear about...", "OHHH, ohkaayy, yeah, She knows And Is Okay with it.", "NTA but I think you were also sure before she pulled this that she would never back out of maintaining the cabin so.... buy her out if you can", "INFO: How frequently does she use this place? You said you're young, do you have any idea how much money $50k actually is? \n\nI can understand being upset someone didn't contribute money, but you said you guys needed to replace the roof, then start talking about how you need nearly $50k. Something about this is not being communicated correctly. A roof on a small cottage is probably like $10k with labor, maybe $15k. \n\nIf I had a family member say to me hey we need you to contribute half on this dilapidated roof and then follow up by saying they need $50k, I'd literally laugh and say absolutely the fuck not.", "Then you should have all sat down, figured out the amount of money needed for the renovations, and figured on the amount you could get for the trees to pay for it. You could then discuss the money you would expect to be paid for your labor. Aunt then has the option of saying yes, or no. Maybe she would rather hire professionals. I don\u2019t understand why she is expected to pony up cash when you have sold and asset to the property.", "So she also paid for the roof then.", "Okay, So it cost 50k in total. The cottage Is literally huge, there's also a Cowshed that's a part of It. She comes here regularly and has parties here. She knew about it for a VERY long time And She agreed to help out. She owns 50% of It. Oh And i know how much money it Is, since i helped my dad a lot with the work in the forest. I think i also reacted the way i did, because my dad was almost never at home because He was always working. Trust me, i know that 50k Is a ton of money.", "Okay, so... We did sit Down about all of it MANY times. That's what makes it even worse i think. Also we sold the wood from the forest since the trees were already dying And we needed to take down the infected trees either way. We didn't sell the forest. We decided to do all the labor in our forest since it's just cheaper. She was expected to pay 50%, because She owns 50% And She uses the cottage regularly.", "Nope. Not at all. The wood was sold thanks to our labor. And only 15% of the forest Is actually owned by her", "I'm just confused why it's costing $50k. A roof on a standard home is like $10k with labor. I'm more under the assumption that she may think you guys are trying to get extra money out of her, and shes just steering clear of the entire situation. \n\nAlso, cottages are by definition small, so you guys may call it a cottage, but that's not an accurate representation. But unless this roof is like 6000 square feet (like a literal mansion, not a cottage) something is very wrong with the cost here. \n\nI can understand your frustration, but if I was your aunt I'd be having 9 million alarm bells going off in my head about the costs we're talking here.", "Right, but she owns 50% or those trees too. I think the way this reads, it could come across as you trying to scam her. However, I think the money that she is withholding is actually money you expected to be paid for labor? That\u2019s fine, as long as this was all discussed. It changes the frame of your story though.", "Mention*", "Technically it's a small farm if you think of It like that. But I forgot to mension that there were some other repairs that had to be done in electricity lol", "Okay, So i looked into it and apparantly my father owns majority of the forest And my aunt owns majority of the meadows. So technically like 85% of the wood Is ours. I'm not sure how to discribe our situation, it's just really complicated", "So just the cottage And the cowshed Is Split 50/50 apparantly", ">Right, but she owns 50% or those trees too\n\nEven if you were right, and based on the comment below you aren't, the trees *needed* to come down.  They were infected. And the money from sale of the wood was used on the cabin, it wasn't pocketed.  No scam involved.  \n\nThey all talked about it, OP and fam did the work so that there would be *less* out of pocket costs for all of them for that and, therefore, more funds available for the needed renovations.  I cannot for the life of me see any sort of perceived scam in these interactions."]}
