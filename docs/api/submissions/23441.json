He can do what he likes, sleep late, get up early, eat when he wants, and have no requirements beyond the fun work and social opportunities, all of which he pays for out of pocket. Meanwhile, the wife is doing all the kid stuff, all the cooking, all the driving, planning, cleaning, etc. for an entire weekend every month. OP is a giant asshole and selfish as fuck. YTA", "Also lmao how awful is the work environment that they need monthly \u2018morale boosting\u2019 trips?!", "Exactly. My husband has to travel internationally for work pretty often (less the last three years but it\u2019s ramping back up), and other than souvenirs for us, he\u2019s never paid for anything. If OP is paying for it, it\u2019s not adding up for me.", "Im glad i wasnt the only one who thought that.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

These aren\u2019t business trips it\u2019s you going out and taking a break from your family while leaving your wife to take care of your kids. If it was one or two times a year then sure go alone but this is EVERY month. You are using pocket money to take vacations. And on top of this with your little update it is obvious that you don\u2019t care about actually trying to fix or better the situation you just wanted to be validated.", "YTA for attempting to justify your *monthly* vacations as a business trip.  You don\u2019t want her to ruin your fun.  Whether thats quiet time with no responsibilities or more adult in nature\u2026..", "YTA \u201cexploit my work for her leisure\u201d news flash bucko: they aren\u2019t paying for it. You\u2019re not exploiting your work for her leisure. Also, it\u2019s a job, so like, who cares if you are? They clearly don\u2019t because other people bring their families. \n\nDo you hate your family? Because it sounds like you hate your family. \n\nHow dare your wife *checks notes* want to go on a vacation and want to spent time with you? Doesn\u2019t she know you\u2019re the specialest guy in the world who needs his extra special monthly vacation from her and your children? /s", "YTA. These aren't business trips, your company isn't paying for them. Companies cover 100% of costs on business trips. What this is is you going on expensive vacations once a month (I'm guessing to visit a ~special someone~) and using up so much money that your wife and kids literally cannot afford to go on vacations.\n\nSo here's what you do: tell your wife about the side peice, get a divorce, and make sure she takes you for every cent you're worth. That way she and the kids can go on the nice vacation they actually deserve and you can be left on the street with the rest of the trash.", "YTA if you want a break, fine. Make a compromise and take her on every other trip. These aren't mandatory, as you've stated, so it's simply not fair that you justify going for yourself and \"getting away\" from your wife and kids without her having the option to do the same. You told her she could go on her own, but that means she has to take the kids so it's not even really a vacation at that point. Are you willing to stay behind and watch the kids while she goes off alone? I bet you're freaking not. I'd bet actual hard cash you aren't and if you said you would I'd challenge you to make good and do it at least once so you can see what it's like. You're being incredibly selfish since it seems like she also works, AND takes care of your kids, alone when you aren't there and based on your whole post I'm guessing you don't do a lot of real parenting when you are home.", "YTA, and parents don\u2019t get a break. Wtf", "Sure, buddy. Your wife is not buying what you're selling and neither am I. The only \"business\" happening on these self-funded trips is playtime for you and very likely your affair partner.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nIf your work isn\u2019t paying for these trips, or reimbursing you, by your own description you\u2019re taking monthly mini vacations. Do you fellow employees also not bring their spouses or partners?\n\nThese aren\u2019t business trips, and they\u2019re not helping you advance your career. \n\nYou seriously can\u2019t see why your wife is getting irritated with this?", "YTA! Your business trips are a lie; you don\u2019t pay for them!", "Yep you got a side piece\u2026I also hope she divorces your thoughtless ass", "I can\u2019t make a firm judgement without additional info. Does your wife get monthly breaks from family responsibilities while you solo parent the children.  If not, you are unequivocally YTA.", "I worked at a hotel that hosted corporate get togethers every so often.  One guy would often come with an obvious side piece.  She was much younger than him and wore no wedding ring.  One time he came in with a woman and  I heard her introduce herself to the front desk as his wife.  So yeah sounds like he\u2019s got himself a side piece.\n\nI was told not to talk to the wife about the other woman by my boss.  They group visited often and paid a lot.", "I resent evening or weekend company parties because I don\u2019t want to spend my off-hours with people I work with. It isn\u2019t a treat if I am spending my personal time at company events.

Treat your wife better or your solo-vacation funds are going to end up being alimony funds REAL quick.", "My husband invites me to his cool business trips all the time\u2014unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to go recently due to my work. \n\nOP is shady.", "And she works!", "Yep.  There\u2019d be a very easy solution if OP wasn\u2019t a gigantic asshole - if they can\u2019t afford the cost of bringing the family along every month, then don\u2019t go on a trip every month and instead bring the family however often they can afford, every other month or whatever.  But they very obviously do not want to do that.  Such an asshole."]}
