Everyone is getting so mad about gender roles, but this is way more about relationships than anything else. If you really don't think your partner would sacrifice their comfort (regardless of gender) or make an attempt to find a way to make you both more comfortable, is this a relationship worth having? Chivalry doesn't have to be male, women can hold open doors, offer jackets, and pay on a date, as can men.

I did this because A) I love her, and I don\u2019t want her to be cold and B) when she got dressed that morning, it looked like it would be a lot warmer than it ended up being, so it was an honest mistake. And C) shit like this matters to your partner. When they screw up, even in stupid, inconsequential things like this, it\u2019s not about saying I-told-you-so, it\u2019s about showing them you care about them. I guarantee when she\u2019s looking back on this, she won\u2019t remember feeling silly for dressing poorly, but what she will remember is you being an asshole about it. \n\nI think you need to learn a little empathy, friend.

It's yours and no one has a right to your belongings... but this is your girlfriend, who no doubt is smaller than you, probably gets colder easier because of it, etc. You didn't want to get cold, but she was VISIBLY cold and shivering. YTA for not giving it to her when you could see she needed it. Part of being in a relationship sometimes means we sacrifice for the other.

You didn\u2019t cause her to be cold, it\u2019s just bad luck. Nothing you did made her cold. \n\nYes if you give her your sweater you\u2019ll be cold, which is just as bad, yes people will more readily expect a guy to do this for their partner than they would a woman. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of women who would give up their comfort for their partner, but society won\u2019t look down on them in the same way for not doing so. That\u2019s not the point, though. \n\nAt the end of the day, doesn\u2019t take much to be nice. You\u2019re not giving up an arm so she doesn\u2019t feel cold. Yes it\u2019s unfair/unequal outcome, anyone who tells you otherwise is just wrong. That being said, I\u2019d just accept the unfairness to make the person I care about feel better. I\u2019d offer it to them to begin with. I think that should be normal when it comes to a person you\u2019re sharing your life with. That\u2019s why I think you\u2019re an asshole.\n\nSimilarly, I can see why she\u2019s upset, but it\u2019s a bit daft to say you\u2019re selfish for not offering it. I think the question of \u201cwhy is it ok for the other partner to be cold if you don\u2019t want to be\u201d is more relevant here. Her taking your sweater is actively making you cold for her benefit. She would be choosing to actively do something that makes you uncomfortable and placing her own comfort above yours. I think it\u2019s an entitled attitude, which is why I think she\u2019s also an asshole. \n\n\nTl;dr: you\u2019re an asshole because I think you should have accepted what is an unfair outcome in the situation because that\u2019s what I think should be done for someone you care about.

We, as women, like to embrace feminism because we SHOULD be able to wear what we want, work where we want, not have kids if we don\u2019t want to, have an equal career, etc., but should that also require us to not be a damsel in distress and plan our fucking wardrobe according to the weather?", "As a woman.... fuck that noise.

I could see your point if he wasn\u2019t, but since he\u2019s cold, other than misandry, why would he be an ah for staying warm with his own sweater when she would prefer he be cold to give his sweater to her?

Or he\u2019ll take my jacket, drape it over his shoulders, and we\u2019ll huddle walk together. Or we switch the jacket while walking. \n\nI could not be with someone - male or female - who was so callous. So it you and I would never date (plus I don\u2019t date children).", "We aren\u2019t going to be popular on this one, buddy!  But I was thinking the same thing!  So he gets to freeze in a t-shirt, while she\u2019s warm?!  He was damned if he did and damned if he didn\u2019t.  I\u2019m a bit independent and would\u2019ve stopped at a store to buy a jacket anyway.  His sweater would\u2019ve gotten soaked anyway.", "Actually I would. I would give my partner my jacket anytime.", "OP said that it was a warm day tho", "Op has thicker skin?  What.", "Why should he buy her a jacket because she was unprepared? Can\u2019t understand this", "Part of being an adult is being prepared. Common sense said it might be colder/cooler when the sun goes down, so bring a light jacket.", "Chivalry is dead and good riddance. Chivalry is just a nice word for sexism.", "this is the determining factor????", "With that logic might as well just get a prostitute", "So be chivalrous because sex is the reward? That is what you are saying.", "Yeah but gf didn't have any sweater to offer OP, so I don't think we could talk about equality here. We don't know if gf would be willing to give her sweater to OP if he needed it. We just know OP is a self-centered person", "You\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t have to suffer, and he doesn\u2019t have to get laid, it\u2019s his choice", "Chivalry is dead, feminism killed it.", "Yes. Men run \u201cwarmer\u201d but it has nothing to do with size or muscle or whatever. It\u2019s actually because women have slightly higher body temperatures (about 0.5C on average) so that we have to work harder to maintain basal temperature than men do and feel cold more readily.  That is why women \u201crun cold\u201d.", "No one said she is entitled to his sweater. \n\nI've already explained how he was TA in this situation. Yet again, part of relationships involve sacrifice to make your SO comfortable/happy. If you still don't understand that then I'm not wasting more of my time explaining it and don't know what else to tell you. \n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with gender, my judgment would stay the exact same even if the roles were reversed.", "His comfort doesn't matter as much as hers because he has a dick.", "Why didn\u2019t they just wait out the rain in the first place or call an Uber?", "I didn't say it wasn't her fault that she was cold. That doesn't refute what I said - that relationships often mean sacrificing something for the one you love. \n\nAs I said before, if I knew my husband was freezing his ass off shivering, I'd be *happy* to offer ways to make him more comfortable, even if it meant losing part of my own comfort. His comfort is mine. His happiness is mine. You should care about your SO enough to not want *them* to suffer, even if it means you will.", "Someone needs to introduce this girl to weather.com.", "Is my name u/Shovelwoman2001 ?", "I would. I would willingly give up my sweater to my boyfriend if he were cold.", "They wouldn't but they'll never admit that.", "Yeah, if the dude was so cold he couldn't even walk and had to ask for help several time and the girl just coldly said no and wouldn't even express any concern, then that couple is so doomed.  \nUber is a really good solution. OP gf's idea of buying a jacket is also cool. OP himself is so selfish and utterly not dependable.", "Same here. I\u2019ve given my husband my hoodie in a restaurant more than once. Dude\u2019s skinny and wears my hoodies all the time. The arms are too short, but so long as he\u2019s warm.", "Hard same. We go ANYWHERE we all take a hoodie. Mine gets cold if it ticks below 70, so even in May, he's not wearing his summer hoodie yet. But it's been a cold May.", "Same here. My husband feels the cold a lot more than I do, and I would have done *something* to help.", "It\u2019s May, you really think she\u2019s so cold she can\u2019t walk? Maybe she\u2019d rather someone else is uncomfortable instead of her?", "I have offered random classmates a jacket or a scarf if they needed it more than I did, regardless of genders. This person here thinking this is acceptable behavior in a partnership is delusional", "Yep. Men have thicker skin than women\n\nhttps://www.dermalogica.com/blogs/living-skin/is-a-mans-skin-really-different-from-a-womans#:~:text=Besides%20having%20facial%20hair%2C%20there,man's%20skin%20texture%20is%20tougher.", "Because if he couldn\u2019t give up his jacket, he could at least help her with a solution.  Don\u2019t complain about something if you aren\u2019t willing to at least try to change it.", "OP said himself that she changed into weather appropriate clothes.  Sometimes the weather is unpredictable.  Where I live, there have been days where it\u2019s forecasted to be sunny and then all of a sudden, it gets windy and starts raining.  Sure it does get cooler in the evening but based on what OP said, it sounds like they weren\u2019t expecting it to be as cold as it was.", "Bad news, it's not dead (yet) and it's not sexism (sexism is discrimination) having different gender roles in a relationship is what a lot of us want.", "You may have misinterpreted my response.  I was referring to his chances now that he made the choice that he did.", "So you\u2019re saying women trade sex for comfort?", "Chivalry is a code of conduct around knights fighting and taking your opponent's dead body home and ransoming it back to their family counts as chivalry.", "That\u2019s because chivalry was some patriarchal bullshit.", "I guess I would be uncomfortable asking my S0 to do some thing that would then make him uncomfortable. But she apparently doesn\u2019t have that issue as long as she\u2019s comfortable.", "So she is the asshole for not accepting her sacrifice so he could be comfortable?", "Homegirl should\u2019ve asked to stay somewhere or Uber if she\u2019s too cold.", "Even if you were also cold?", "Too bad I wasn't asking you.", "I\u2019m literally a dude", "We are at the end of autumn here (Sydney) and mine is wearing a jumper and a hoodie already, while I'm going around in shirtsleeves. If he was cold and I was in a sweater, I'd definitely give it to him.\n\nIt's not about gender. It's about do you care about the other person?", "I mean, winter begins in June in the southern hemisphere. It\u2019s possible they\u2019re from Argentina, Australia, or the like.", "He wasn\u2019t complaining, she was", "If you could just explain that to all women that would be dope.", "Personally, I try not to ask my husband something that would make him uncomfortable but every now and then  (depending on what it is) I will ask because I know he genuinely won't mind, because he also wants me to be comfortable/happy. Same goes for him to me, he usually avoids asking me to do something that would make me unhappy/uncomfortable, but every now and then he still does ask for something, and it doesn't make me upset because I know it will make him feel better, which in turn still makes me happy. \n\n Honestly to me it just levels out - yeah I might be cold if I give up my jacket, but it's so worth it and it makes me happy that he's no longer cold. Does that make sense? We both look out for each other, it shouldn't be always one person sacrificing for another.", "How can she be sacrificing something when she's not giving anything up?", "Naw. They both sound like they didn\u2019t think things all the way through once it started raining.", "Absolutely.  I am more than willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for those that I love.", "Even in the US they have been storms lately.  This was at night when it\u2019s generally colder and it\u2019s been oddly cold in a lot of places lately. I mean I live in a notoriously weather-less and warm area and it was still 49F today.  That\u2019s winter weather here. The state my brother lives in has had storms for days.", "That\u2019s fair too! I guess I was more saying that just because it\u2019s May doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it wasn\u2019t cold enough to be more than just chilly.", "In the Eastern US here.  One town in my state got 20.3 inches of snow this past week.  Broke a 100 year old record.  It can be cold in May in many areas.  Last year at this time it was nearly 80 degrees every day.", "Oh I completely agree with you. I just meant to add on that no matter where they\u2019re from she could absolutely be very cold, especially in rain."]}
