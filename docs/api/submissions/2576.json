One of our middle kids (26F) and her husband (20 something? M) are in the process of buying their second house. Their first one sold quickly and the new owners offered extra for a quick possession. They don't get possession of they new place until January 1st, they had to leave their place November 1st.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey had planned on getting an Air BnB, but my wife and I have an apartment over our garage and offered them that space. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings had been going really well, they both work so they went about life. My wife loves to cook for more than one person, so they've been eating dinner with us most nights. That part has been wonderful, its been so nice having my daughter around in the evenings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other night after they had gone back to the apartment I went to get something from the garage. The apartment can be accessed from the outside, and the inside, there is a staircase inside the garage, and only an interior door separating the garage from the apartment. I could hear them, very obviously having sex. I felt it was a bit disrespectful to be having sex when they are staying with her parents. I thought I had raised her better than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my wife, and she laughed, she said and I quote \"good for them\". I couldnt let it go, so the next night at dinner I brought up how disrespectful we find it for them to be having sex in our home. My wife did not back me up, she made sure to tell them it wasn't \"we\" but only me who felt that way. My daughter and her husband excused themselves from the meal. I expected an apology, but instead they moved out the next day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife says they are a married couple, and aren't even in our house, that I was an AH. But in my mind they are staying in an apartment on our property they could at least abstain until they don't live with us. I would never dream of disrespecting my parents having sex in their house. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668718772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy1fjk/aita_for_asking_my_daughter_not_to_have_sex_while/", "score": 6609, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Want to talk about disrespect. Not knowing your son's age is disrespectful. Second realize your daughters age. She's an adult who is allowed to have sex if she wants.

There is nothing wrong or disrespectful about married couple having sex in other peoples houses as long as it\u2019s behind closed doors. Not too many generations ago many families lived in multigenerational households. Get over yourself.", "YTA.

They\u2019ve got two months staying with you, that YOU chose to offer them, if you had a modicum of sense you should have been able to predict that your 20-something daughter might want to have sex with her partner at least once in a sixty day period, if this is such an issue for you then you either get with the program or explain that your views are incompatible. \n\nYTA though, because you are the ONLY person in this scenario who has an issue with it.

The fact that you actually brought it up OVER DINNER is even more creepy. Like that is appropriate dinner conversation?", "YTA because they are adults in a consensual relationship. What did you really expect them to do in the privacy of the bedroom you lent to them? The issue you have is your expectation is not based on reality. Let them have a healthy sexual relationship. It bodes well for their longterm relationship.", "Lmao what did I just read?

First, I find it quite telling that you don\u2019t even know your SIL well enough to know his age. That shows an incredible lack of engagement on your part. Second, they aren\u2019t disrespecting your house by having sex in it. How in the world is sex between your daughter and her husband disrespectful to you? What kind of household are you where you forbid grown adult couples from engaging in sex in your house? Your pre-occupation with your daughter\u2019s sex life is super creepy.

The apartment can be accessed from the outside, and the inside, there is a staircase inside the garage, and only an interior door separating the garage from the apartment.

I thought I had raised her better than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my wife, and she laughed, she said and I quote \"good for them\". I couldnt let it go, so the next night at dinner I brought up how disrespectful we find it for them to be having sex in our home. My wife did not back me up, she made sure to tell them it wasn't \"we\" but only me who felt that way. My daughter and her husband excused themselves from the meal.
