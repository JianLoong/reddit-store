If the doula suspects this and has not actually tested for it with a very easy urine test, then she could be liable.

I'm not sure you'd be an AH for sending an ambulance or not, but in the end your sister (and most likely her boyfriend) can just refuse the medical care anyway. \n\nI don't think this is a matter of who's the asshole, to be honest. Your sister is very ignorant and is in a borderline (at the very least) abusive relationship with a very ignorant man. As a result, she and her unborn baby are both under considerable health and even life risk. It's a terribly tragic situation, because the risk they're taking is unnecessary in this day and age. Assuming the best (that she and the baby do fine), her choice of not vaccinating the child is already a sign of a very risky life for the poor thing going forward. \n\nI sincerely hope things go well.

Those negative consequences could save a life, and take the heat of your sister as she didn't make the decision.", "NTA\n\nThe real question isn't if calling the ambulance will make you a TA -- \n\nReal question:  Can you live with yourself if either of them die?", "So NTA for your caring mindsets but I don't think this is a case of asshole or not to be honest... \n\nI'm certainly no authority in the subject but I agree that your sister is making a lot of bad decisions. I'm also super concerned about her controlling boyfriend who's showing plenty of red flags\n\n*But* I don't think sending an ambulance over there will necessarily help. An EMT can't force her to go to a hospital. She can just refuse and it sounds like she will.", "Even without the pre-ecclampsia, being 43 weeks pregnant is a huge health risk for both her and her unborn child. The risk of death for one or both of them is pretty real. \n\nI don't think calling an ambulance to their house will help though: she's an adult and can refuse to get in it.  TBH, it sounds like everyone has done their very best to convince her to seek medical care. I wonder if it's time to compromise to at least mitigate the risks. See if you can partner with her doula to figure out what medical support you can have on stand-by? Would they be willing to deliver close to a hospital (just in case)? Would they be willing for you to call EMS once the baby is crowning (just in case)?  Not that an ambulance carries almost any of the equipment needed to resuscitate a newborn, but at least they could get a baby to a hospital faster than the doula could. Would they be willing to deliver in the hospital with the doula acting as a buffer between the delivery team and your sister? It won't help her avoid medically emergent care (that's kinda the point) but at least the doula could ask the medical team to defer the vaccine talk as well as the other medically recommended (but luckily rarely emergent) interventions like vit K and eye ointment and the newborn screen etc.\n\nIn my book, what your sister is doing is full on neglecting her unborn child and allowing them to incur a high risk of death or serious neurological injury. But I realize that not everyone believes that. Many would happily die and kill or maim their baby in the process rather than seek medical care, because \"that's what people did for thousands of years, it's natural\".  Once people are holding these beliefs, however, convincing them otherwise is very challenging. They didn't form their beliefs using facts and logic. So, your rational arguments basically have no power to change their minds -  facts and reason didn't get them into that situation in the first place. You have a better bet going with emotional arguments & risk-mitigation talk (\"I'm so worried, what if something happened to you and your baby would be raised without a mother to advocate for them? Would it be safer to deliver at a hospital where you could get care, and that way down the road you'll be there to ensure your kid is raised the way you want and stays unvaccinated?\" or form back-up plans like delivering very close to a hospital.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Birth can go wrong so quickly and if she is passed 40 weeks pregnancy starts to get more dangerous too. It also doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s had too much prenatal care?

What they can't refuse is life-saving critical care.", "I'm not either, but I'm hoping that OP can talk to the sister first so that at least, with some warning that it's coming, the sister can be encouraged to make best use of the ambulance. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll just send it away and nothing will change.\n\nActually, a police welfare check might be the best move. You can ask the police to look in on somebody you're concerned about, and they might be able to exert more pressure on the sister (and boyfriend) to get to the hospital ASAP already than the paramedics could.", "That\u2019s why I said OP wasn\u2019t TA for wanting to or trying but the EMTs might feel different or those who need help might feel different.", "Yes welfare check.

I think that parents that won't vaccinate are idiots and awful humans (my kid had a close call with a measles exposure before my kid was old enough to be vaccinated and I'm still angry) but the point now is helping this kid and mom survive.", "Allll of this. These are really serious conditions. I'm not a healthcare professional by any means but this is so many red flags in one situation. This isn't a case of family overstepping about a potentially straightforward homebirth. This is someone who is post dates, likely very low amniotic fluid, serious chance of a lot of meconium in the remaining fluid/meconium aspiration, aging placenta, and then on top of that high BP and protein in urine. This could be deadly for both mom and baby. The risk cannot be overstated. Keeping your family in my thoughts - I hope things end up okay but immediate medical intervention is needed.", "My mom and I would probably both be dead if it wasn't for treatment for pre-eclampsia.  My mom's kidneys didn't function properly when she had pre-eclampsia with me.  She recovered but it took hospitalization.", "No because doulas are not qualified medical professionals. A doula should not be caring for a woman at all. A doula is a support person for pregnancy and labor. They are not medical personnel. \n\nThe doula SHOULD be insisting the sister see actual healthcare professionals. Quite frankly the doula should be telling OP\u2019s sister that she is not qualified to care for her because it\u2019s giving OP\u2019s sister a false sense of having her blood pressure under control and having someone \u201ctreating\u201d her. The doula should be saying \u201cin my limited experience as a support person, this is something every mother I have worked with has needed to see a doctor or midwife for. This is not something I can offer you any advice or care for.\u201d", "Totally agree. Right now they\u2019re literally on death\u2019s door is she\u2019s that far past full term & with pre-eclampsia (sounds more like eclampsia). I hope the OP calls for an ambulance.", "I know it can be declined but I\u2019m telling you my hospital didn\u2019t offer it in the hospital. Their policy was for vaccines to given at the pediatricians office. I had six kids (set of twins) between 1994 to 2003 & that\u2019s how their births were.\n\nMy eldest grand child was born in 2017 (same hospital as her mom) & it was the same thing: heel prick & ointment. Vaccines at doctor\u2019s. When the youngest two were born it was at a military hospital & same thing: heel prick & ointment. If a vitamin k injection was administered it was done while the baby wasn\u2019t in the room but I was with one from the minute they wheeled in her (emergency c-section) until her mom recovered. I\u2019d have to look at their records (I have custody while their mom is deployed) to verify it but I don\u2019t think all hospitals administer vitamin k injections at birth. As for vaccines, that might also be regional.", "Yup, many risk, amniotic fluid is just one of them", "Right. I'm a huge vaccination fan, but the vaccination argument can wait. The preeclampsia (and a 3-week overdue baby) are priority right now.", "Which is why OPs sister probably needs CPS intervention if they want to refuse that", "Agree!!! Call for a wellness check and they will most likely  bring ambulance with them if you explain situation on your call.  Boyfriend and sister will have much more difficult time refusing medical care if officer is involved", "Yep my kidneys stopped functioning the day they admitted me. I had been peeing a ridiculous amount of fluid until then, that day almost nothing", "I can't imagine placing my child at risk. I had an awful labor and delivery and would have died if I wasn't in the hospital. I was so healthy until I wasn't too- I am super skeptical of home birth even with medical monitoring (which isn't even the case here) due to my experience.", "I obviously can\u2019t speak for every hospital in the nation but it is the norm at the several dozen hospitals I have worked at over the last 25 years. I do not disbelieve your account at all, different hospitals do definitely work differently to an extent\u2014 it just hasn\u2019t been the norm in the US per my experience and goes against the CDC recommendations.", "Sounds like OPs sister is just as complicit. Probably would be better to try and convince the sister to go before calling and if not, call the police and CPS.", "Sorry but if she refuses saying she\u2019s fine then there\u2019s nothing you can do. If it is abusive and then see it then they\u2019d call the police but if she says she\u2019s fine and her doula is there then no, they won\u2019t do anything no matter what you want to believe. \nAnd yea, might make me heartless but I\u2019d be pissed of my family member needed an ambulance but didn\u2019t get one in time because they were late due to trying to convince a pregnant woman to go to the hospital but refused.", "I don't think OP is complicit. It's really hard to know what the right course of action is in such cases, all the more when it involves medical care. And potential domestic abuse.", "Not sure what is so hard to understand in my comment: never said they could force her or do something if she doesn't want. But they'd try to help her, as that's their job. It's not a matter of what I believe, it's what they do. \n\nAnd yes, you are heartless.", "Guess it\u2019s opinion then because she seems complicit", "I\u2019m fine being heartless then"]}
