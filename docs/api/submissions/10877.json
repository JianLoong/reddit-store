Preeclampsia is not a slow moving issue. Eclampsia is deadly and she would likely die if she progressed to this and had no treatment. If the doula suspects this and has not actually tested for it with a very easy urine test, then she could be liable. If something happens to your sister you could sue for wrongful death or even have her arrested and charged. Is the doula discouraging her from a hospital visit?

I'm not sure you'd be an AH for sending an ambulance or not, but in the end your sister (and most likely her boyfriend) can just refuse the medical care anyway. \n\nI don't think this is a matter of who's the asshole, to be honest. Your sister is very ignorant and is in a borderline (at the very least) abusive relationship with a very ignorant man. As a result, she and her unborn baby are both under considerable health and even life risk. It's a terribly tragic situation, because the risk they're taking is unnecessary in this day and age. Assuming the best (that she and the baby do fine), her choice of not vaccinating the child is already a sign of a very risky life for the poor thing going forward. \n\nI sincerely hope things go well.

Personally I would, but you are interfering with someone else's health, who I assume has the capacity to make the decision. \n\nJust because you wouldn't be TA doesn't mean there won't be negative consequences. Those negative consequences could save a life, and take the heat of your sister as she didn't make the decision.", "NTA\n\nThe real question isn't if calling the ambulance will make you a TA -- \n\nReal question:  Can you live with yourself if either of them die?", "So NTA for your caring mindsets but I don't think this is a case of asshole or not to be honest... \n\nI'm certainly no authority in the subject but I agree that your sister is making a lot of bad decisions. I'm also super concerned about her controlling boyfriend who's showing plenty of red flags\n\n*But* I don't think sending an ambulance over there will necessarily help. An EMT can't force her to go to a hospital. She can just refuse and it sounds like she will.", "Even without the pre-ecclampsia, being 43 weeks pregnant is a huge health risk for both her and her unborn child. The risk of death for one or both of them is pretty real. \n\nI don't think calling an ambulance to their house will help though: she's an adult and can refuse to get in it.  TBH, it sounds like everyone has done their very best to convince her to seek medical care. I wonder if it's time to compromise to at least mitigate the risks. See if you can partner with her doula to figure out what medical support you can have on stand-by? Would they be willing to deliver close to a hospital (just in case)? Would they be willing for you to call EMS once the baby is crowning (just in case)?  Not that an ambulance carries almost any of the equipment needed to resuscitate a newborn, but at least they could get a baby to a hospital faster than the doula could. Would they be willing to deliver in the hospital with the doula acting as a buffer between the delivery team and your sister? It won't help her avoid medically emergent care (that's kinda the point) but at least the doula could ask the medical team to defer the vaccine talk as well as the other medically recommended (but luckily rarely emergent) interventions like vit K and eye ointment and the newborn screen etc.\n\nIn my book, what your sister is doing is full on neglecting her unborn child and allowing them to incur a high risk of death or serious neurological injury. But I realize that not everyone believes that. Many would happily die and kill or maim their baby in the process rather than seek medical care, because \"that's what people did for thousands of years, it's natural\".  Once people are holding these beliefs, however, convincing them otherwise is very challenging. They didn't form their beliefs using facts and logic. So, your rational arguments basically have no power to change their minds -  facts and reason didn't get them into that situation in the first place. You have a better bet going with emotional arguments & risk-mitigation talk (\"I'm so worried, what if something happened to you and your baby would be raised without a mother to advocate for them? Would it be safer to deliver at a hospital where you could get care, and that way down the road you'll be there to ensure your kid is raised the way you want and stays unvaccinated?\" or form back-up plans like delivering very close to a hospital.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Birth can go wrong so quickly and if she is passed 40 weeks pregnancy starts to get more dangerous too. It also doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s had too much prenatal care?

Even if you can't or they won't let you.", "They do. They vaccinate against Hepatitis, but the parents can absolutely refuse the vaccinations. What they can't refuse is life-saving critical care.", "I'm not either, but I'm hoping that OP can talk to the sister first so that at least, with some warning that it's coming, the sister can be encouraged to make best use of the ambulance. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll just send it away and nothing will change.\n\nActually, a police welfare check might be the best move. You can ask the police to look in on somebody you're concerned about, and they might be able to exert more pressure on the sister (and boyfriend) to get to the hospital ASAP already than the paramedics could.", "That\u2019s why I said OP wasn\u2019t TA for wanting to or trying but the EMTs might feel different or those who need help might feel different.", "Yes welfare check. That is a good idea. They will talk to the sister without the boyfriend and take action if they feel someone is in danger.", "Yeah, I'm sure most EMTs seeing a pregnant woman at risk of dying will feel \"what a waste of my time\" if she refuses care. \n\nThey wouldn't try to reason with her or call the police if they thought her boyfriend is abusive, and they wouldn't ultimately walk away feeling defeated and concerned for their safety. Nah, all they'd think is that it was a waste of time. \n\nOn the other hand, what kind of heartless person do you have to be to be mad that an ambulance went to try and save a woman and her unborn child's lives instead of coming to you... \n\nAnyway."]}
