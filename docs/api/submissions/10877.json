She has an off-grid lifestyle, and from the start, voiced that she is going to do homebirth because of the corruption at hospitals. Her main problem with hospitals is that they're  pushy and will advocate for her to vaccinate her baby, push her to get an epidural or pain meds, and give unnecessary c-sections. \n\nCool, I respected her choices from the start, being that she had told my family and I she would go to a hospital if there's complications. However, she has not gone to the hospital a single time because her boyfriend is extremely anti-hospitals, and she also believes a sonogram could hurt the baby in early stages. \n\nShe is going on 43 weeks according to the date of conception, and according to her doula, her uterus is measuring at 40 weeks. Here's where the problem is: she and the doula believe she has pre-eclampsia and were even trying home remedies to treat it. She is swelling, has pains, and her blood pressure is seriously high last night it was 107 DIA and today is 91. \n\nMy family and I have been begging her to go to the hospital, and she told us that if the baby isn't here by Friday or Saturday, she will go to the hospital. Last night, I messaged her, telling her the dangers and damage pre-eclampsia could be doing to her and her baby right now. She explained to us that she's worried of how her boyfriend will react if she goes to the hospital, saying he'll \"be p*ssed\" saying that if she goes to the hospital, the baby will get vaccinated and \"end up in the NICU\". \n\nLong story short, she's not going to the hospital because she's worried that her boyfriend will react badly. This morning, she texted the family group chat, saying she believes greasy morning breakfast is giving her high blood pressure and that her blood pressure is going down now. AKA, she's not going to the hospital. My family and I are really worried about her, WIBTA for sending an ambulance to her house? Money is not a concern if that's relevant.\n\nUpdate: My family and I gave her 2 options. We told her we will order an Uber for her to go to the hospital, and if she doesn't go, we will have the county conduct a wellness check and explain the situation to them. If she doesn't reply in the next 30 minutes, we will be calling the non-emergency line to conduct a wellness check.\n\nUpdate 2: My sister and her boyfriend were both at home and the police said they were fine. I had given the police all the details and did everything I could do. My sister is ignoring contact from us. I'm not sure what to do at this point, so I guess I'll update you guys if she has the baby. If you guys don't hear from me in the next week or 2, assume I'm grieving. I was really hoping to give a better update but it didn't work out that way.", "created_utc": 1677340068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bo21y/wibta_for_calling_an_ambulance_to_my_pregnant/", "score": 1593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the doula suspects this and has not actually tested for it with a very easy urine test, then she could be liable.

I'm not sure you'd be an AH for sending an ambulance or not, but in the end your sister (and most likely her boyfriend) can just refuse the medical care anyway. \n\nI don't think this is a matter of who's the asshole, to be honest. Your sister is very ignorant and is in a borderline (at the very least) abusive relationship with a very ignorant man. As a result, she and her unborn baby are both under considerable health and even life risk. It's a terribly tragic situation, because the risk they're taking is unnecessary in this day and age. Assuming the best (that she and the baby do fine), her choice of not vaccinating the child is already a sign of a very risky life for the poor thing going forward. \n\nI sincerely hope things go well.

Personally I would, but you are interfering with someone else's health, who I assume has the capacity to make the decision. \n\nJust because you wouldn't be TA doesn't mean there won't be negative consequences. Those negative consequences could save a life, and take the heat of your sister as she didn't make the decision.", "NTA\n\nThe real question isn't if calling the ambulance will make you a TA -- \n\nReal question:  Can you live with yourself if either of them die?", "So NTA for your caring mindsets but I don't think this is a case of asshole or not to be honest... \n\nI'm certainly no authority in the subject but I agree that your sister is making a lot of bad decisions. I'm also super concerned about her controlling boyfriend who's showing plenty of red flags\n\n*But* I don't think sending an ambulance over there will necessarily help. An EMT can't force her to go to a hospital. She can just refuse and it sounds like she will.", "Even without the pre-ecclampsia, being 43 weeks pregnant is a huge health risk for both her and her unborn child. The risk of death for one or both of them is pretty real. \n\nI don't think calling an ambulance to their house will help though: she's an adult and can refuse to get in it.  TBH, it sounds like everyone has done their very best to convince her to seek medical care. I wonder if it's time to compromise to at least mitigate the risks. See if you can partner with her doula to figure out what medical support you can have on stand-by? Would they be willing to deliver close to a hospital (just in case)? Would they be willing for you to call EMS once the baby is crowning (just in case)?  Not that an ambulance carries almost any of the equipment needed to resuscitate a newborn, but at least they could get a baby to a hospital faster than the doula could. Would they be willing to deliver in the hospital with the doula acting as a buffer between the delivery team and your sister? It won't help her avoid medically emergent care (that's kinda the point) but at least the doula could ask the medical team to defer the vaccine talk as well as the other medically recommended (but luckily rarely emergent) interventions like vit K and eye ointment and the newborn screen etc.\n\nIn my book, what your sister is doing is full on neglecting her unborn child and allowing them to incur a high risk of death or serious neurological injury. But I realize that not everyone believes that. Many would happily die and kill or maim their baby in the process rather than seek medical care, because \"that's what people did for thousands of years, it's natural\".  Once people are holding these beliefs, however, convincing them otherwise is very challenging. They didn't form their beliefs using facts and logic. So, your rational arguments basically have no power to change their minds -  facts and reason didn't get them into that situation in the first place. You have a better bet going with emotional arguments & risk-mitigation talk (\"I'm so worried, what if something happened to you and your baby would be raised without a mother to advocate for them? Would it be safer to deliver at a hospital where you could get care, and that way down the road you'll be there to ensure your kid is raised the way you want and stays unvaccinated?\" or form back-up plans like delivering very close to a hospital.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Therefore, she could be involuntarily hospitalized for psychiatric care, but of course would immediately be stabilized medically.

Will they try to convince her to go to the hospital? It actually depends. \n\nSo say OP calls the ambulance and tells them she is worried about her sister. They show up at the house and boyfriend answers the door and tells them that they aren't wanted, go away. I've been in this situation, and I said great, I'm here to talk to so and so, let me speak to them and if they don't want me I'll leave, but I'll stay here all night banging on your door until I get to see them so go get them for me and we'll chat.\n\nIf sister comes to talk to them she could do one of two things. She could agree to let them look at her since they're there. Or she could say no, go away, I'm absolutely fine, I'm very pregnant but I'm taking care of things and I'm ok. We on reddit know/believe that's a lie but if she does not appear to be in immediate life threatening danger and if she is oriented mentally she can ask them to leave and they legally have to do so. I've showed up to people's homes and they've said yes I'm having a medical problem but I don't want your help now get out. I'm gone, because now I'm trespassing and if I try to force my help that's assault and battery. They can try to convince her to let them look her over, but if she refuses, nope, they're gone and now she is just pissed at OP and won't trust her and the boyfriend is going see, I told you your sister interferes with everything.\n\nOption two is that sister allows them to assess her, even though she didn't call them. I've had people who don't want me and I'm like ok, cool, I get you don't want to go to the hospital and I'm absolutely not going to force you, but since I'm already here can I check your vitals and talk to you? And sometimes they'll let me. By starting with the whole, hey, we don't have to go anywhere I'm reminding them that they ultimately are in control and can trust me. I'll check them over, and if I see something I don't like I'll have an educated conversation with them about all the reasons why I believe they need medical treatment, but I've already established that level of trust that I'm not going to force you into my ambulance and drive away. If I'm sensing a weird power dynamic from boyfriend I might even be like hey, I promise we aren't going anywhere, but some of my gear is in the ambulance, do you mind walking out and sitting in the back with me, you can leave at any time. Then I can talk privately and try to suss out if things are safe. IF sister lets them assess her and IF they're good at what they do that's what might happen, but even then there's absolutely no guarantee she'd still go. \n\nAgain, whether or not OP calls the ambulance is not something I'll pass judgement on, but I think, depending on family dynamics, it might be better for the family to go over and have a group talk with sister. In my experience as an EMT family was often the absolute best way to convince someone to go to the hospital, because they could reassure the person they were doing the right thing, they things at home would be taken care of, and all the little interpersonal things that we wouldn't know about.

I hope for a good outcome for mom and child.", "Loss mother here\n\nNTA \nYou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink so to speak. \n\nYour sister and her boyfriend are extreme AHs. Let her know that when this baby dies it will 100% be their fault. Hell, it may even take her with it. \n\nAlso, that doula is not a medical professional. She\u2019s there for support and has zero medical knowledge.", "NTA", "NTA. Please update us on her wellbeing. I've seen you've called a police wellness check. Well done, sounds like she's being abused", "NTA. I am so sorry this is happening. You did the right thing.", "NTA maybe social services can have a chat with her. \nFrom the sounds of it she might be vulnerable in a controlling relationship.\n\nPre eclampsia can go badly when the birth starts, she should have medical input right away ( I had it, it\u2019s not something you want to fuck about with) plus it can continue beyond the birth. \n\nIf she continues on this avenue she could be deemed not to have proper parental capacity in which case social services do need to be involved.", "I'm sorry to see this last update. I will pray for your sister and the baby.  You can only do so much for the unwilling. :(", "43 weeks from date of conception is\u2026 45 weeks gestational. I\u2019d be very surprised if that baby is still alive, but at the same time I don\u2019t exactly trust this woman or her doula to have calculated it correctly. I hope everything turns out okay, against all the odds. My heart\u2019s with you and your family, OP.", "NTA. At this point it\u2019s not even just about her and boyfriend, they are risking this baby\u2019s life by being absolute idiots. If this baby has any trouble at birth it will be their fault. What if baby got cerebral palsy ? What about ombilical cord around neck ? Trouble with breathing ? They are brainwashed", "NTA - if the baby is vaccinated and in the NICU it isn't dead. Also she should fucking vaccinate because some babies cant be and whooping cough and measles can kill babies. Antivaxxers are the worrrssst", "What on Earth did you think the police would do?. Use your brain ffs.", "There is no source for non existent research!", "NTA pre eclampsia  is a  killer you are doing everything g to keep your sister and her child alive I hope.sje goes hospital", "NTA.\n\nThere's an \"off-the-grid\" lifestyle. There is also a \"need to adjust the tin foil in my hat\" lifestyle.  I have absolutely no patience for the latter.  Sonograms.. vaccines... sigh.

Is she safe?", "Nta it's not just her safety it's also an innocent life. Also.does her boyfriend know she could die? Does he care about her ?", "I\u2019m all for the crunchy home birth lifestyle. But pre eclampsia can be very dangerous to mom and baby. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s probably not 43 weeks (it\u2019s common and normal to go to 42 weeks but if measuring 40 she\u2019s probably wrong about date or she should get checked out). I hope your sister realizes you can still say no to things if you birth at a hospital. (Vaccinations, procedures, ect) unless they need to preform something to save your life I\u2019d assume. Hopefully she has a home birth midwife watching over her care and birth as they come prepared with things to assist baby and mom if any complications. A doulas role is more of a labor support rather than a medical provider. I loved my doula but my midwife was the care provider and trained for complications.", "I'm a little surprised to hear so many people here disagree with this but...\n\nHer body her choice... right?  \n\nWhy does that not apply here??", "NTA. \nI feel so bad for that poor baby. Probably won't get vaccinated, regular pediatric check-ups. I hope that you don't have to get CPS involved, but just be aware this may need to happen", "An ambulance isn't going to solve anything if she doesn't want to go. She'll sign a release form denying consent for treatment and transport. Only way you're getting her in tge ambulance is if she's passed out, then it's implied consent, or she's placed under arrest for being a danger to herself or others. The latter being used most often in psychiatric patients who are not rational ro make informed decisions.", "Glad you have something in motion. Sometimes the authorities can do more than we know They may get your sister aside and away from him and ask her questions and talk her into going to the hospital. Sometimes they have a way that we simply do not. We are glad you posted here and glad you are taking this to the next level to help your sister. It may just be the internet, but yeah.

Their child is at risk.", "I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s not really 43 weeks or not really showing signs of preeclampsia for the doula not to be concerned? Or maybe she doesn\u2019t have a midwife? Most would make sure preeclampsia is taken seriously", "I hope she doesn't get HELLP syndrome or eclampsia from untreated preeclampsia. You're NTA but your sister is. The harm she's doing to herself and the baby is just so fucked up.", "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear this. I know when it's someone you love, hearing, \"You did the best you could do,\" is cold comfort, but right now, it is all I have to offer. You really did do everything you could do in this situation. I am just praying that your sister's stupidity doesn't hurt her or the baby. (The boyfriend, however, can rot.)", "I was hoping that the police showing up would be a wake up call for either one, or both, of them.

The fact that she's more scared of his anger than worried for her own life tells me there might actually be some abuse, but I could be wrong. Regardless, right now isn't the time for right and wrong, it's about life and death. \n\nIf money isn't an issue, can you take the earliest flight you can and go there with the cops to take her?", "\"Police said they were fine\"\n\nDid they check the baby?\n\nThis is horrible.", "I hope you\u2019re okay OP. I know that this is so frustrating and anger inducing. I wish I could give you a hug!", "Is there a man in your family who could talk to your sister's boyfriend? Would he take a call (not a text, a call) from your Dad?\n\n(I know this is the second reply of mine that leaned heavily on the man angle -- but that's just because, the men I know in real life, who sound similar to how you describe sister's boyfriend, won't listen to women, but usually wet their pants when men stand up to them.)", "Not to mention if they never did a sonogram they have no idea if the baby is breeched and they're doing a home birth.", "That baby is probably gonna die, if they\u2019re not already. That whole womb is gonna be meconium.", "Depending on where this is, it could be negligent homicide.  Any state in the United States would call the baby a baby.", "The sister is refusing to go to the hospital against the doulas advice.", "Where I live at least, social services won\u2019t get involved until the baby is born.  Depending on the state and the hospital\u2019s policies, things like refusal of the Vitamin K shot will get an automatic report to child protective services.  I wonder if they (or at least the boyfriend) know this, which is contributing to their refusal to go.", "You're probably right. He doesn't care if she dies, as long as his irrational fear of hospitals is validated.", "Worst thing in the world with this kind of person is being wrong. Death is a distant second.", "Do you or any of your family have contact info for any of her friends who are local? That\u2019s another option, that may be more effective (friends may be more willing to act as family would- bully the boyfriend, refuse to take no for an answer)", "I don't know why CPS wouldn't work.  Every state in the Union --especially North Carolina -- would call a 40-week pregnancy a \"child\", not a \"fetus.\"  She's gonna kill that kid.\n\nAnd it's on her.  The boyfriend is a fucking a-hole, but this is on her.  She could go to the hospital if she wanted to.  She's a grown-ass woman.  The cops were even there, FFS.  Why didn't she ask for a ride?\n\nAnd what is up with that \"doula\"?  She get her training from YouTube?", "You could absolutely and should absolutely call CPS.", "They wouldn\u2019t be trained to check on the baby or do medical checks.

They can\u2019t force someone to go to the hospital unless they have reason to believe they want to hurt themselves or others.", "We refused the hepb in the hospital, no risk factors. Kids got it when they started school. You can refuse vax in hospital and do it at your doctor. I am not antivax, but one of my kids had a serious vax reaction so we are cautious vax.", "If a doula is recommending hospital then you know it's serious!  Doulas are typically very anti-hospital and pro-natural. \n\nI hope your sister and nibling make it through alive.

They can also get a physician on the phone while on site to try and talk to her", "I think OP means midwife because apparently this \"doula\" is also administering urine tests. Either way they're apparently not actually certified either. Really gives midwives, doulas, and home birth a bad name.", "This is important point. I am in the UK and they would absolutely get involved, better to pick up the phone and just ask. \n\nI genuinely worry, I remember I had to be given emergency treatment during the birth and my pre eclampsia wasn\u2019t even that bad. \n\nI suppose in the US there is the added consideration of insurance as well \ud83d\ude1e", "My friend had a benign tumor develop on her adrenal gland during her 2nd pregnancy.
