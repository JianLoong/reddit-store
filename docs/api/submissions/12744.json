I wake up at 5:15AM to get ready and drive over to my sister's house. It's a hassle but I love doing this, she's the cutest sweetest kid and it's bonding time.\n\nThe issue is that I take her to school but I'm not in charge of picking her up, that's on her parents (split up but co-parent well). Frequently my niece will take whatever coat she's wearing off in their car after school on the drive home. For whatever reason, her parents never remember to bring her coats in and they all end up left in their 2 cars. This becomes a problem for me at 7:15 when I try to take her to school and realize there's no coats. I've been forced to bundle her up in 3-4 layers of sweaters in below freezing weather. I've complained to my sister and niece's dad multiple times. Administrators sent out multiple emails to remind parents (aka specifically my sister but they try to be niece and send it to everyone) that kids need to be wearing coats in the morning. Twice in January the principle reminded me when I dropped her off in the morning (there's always a principle.or receptionists to greet each Kindergardener at the back door). It's embarrassing to drop off a 5 year old in freezing weather with no coat, and my niece shouldn't have to freeze in the AM. \n\nLast month I told my sister that she needs to either teach my niece to carry her coat in or she needs to do it herself, but that if it happens again I won't take her to school. \n\nIt was 16 degrees Friday AM, and I go to leave the house with her - no coat. I called my sister to ask her where her coat is and she said they're all in their cars. I was angry and hung up on her and went to get sweaters. Then I changed my mind and texted my sister that she can either take an hour off work to bring me a coat or I'm keeping my niece home with me but I'm not taking her out in 16 degree weather without a coat. My sister didn't see the message until 9AM and she called me absolutely furious that I didn't just take her to school. I told her that I was sick of going out of my way to take her daughter to school all the time and she couldn't even give me the basic courtesy of making sure I had what I needed to get her to school. This has caused a riff between is the last few days and family is split about who is the AH. I think this is a clear everyone sucks - I'll admit I was trying to be petty to teach her a lesson - but some people think my sister is basically innocent and I broke her trust.

You were specifically following the school's rules.  They weren't happy with your niece showing up without a coat, and would have also been upset.  The school was telling them that you couldn't bring her without a coat, and you were telling them you couldn't bring her without a coat, and she didn't have a coat, and you didn't bring her.\n\nThat's not even petty, or cruel, or snarky, or anything.  That's just the simple if-then algorithm of following the rules.  You weren't ALLOWED to take her without a coat.  I mean, they would have let it slide, because what else could they do, especially since it wasn't your fault, but you were doing what the school wanted you to do.", "Nta.

You're the responsible one and going out of your way for your niece, the least your sister can do is leave a jacket for her daughter. This is borderline neglect on her part.", "NTA. They let it slide because you've taken the time to layer her up with sweaters and it hasn't been a problem with them until you rightfully put your foot down.", "NTA--this is just poor planning on her part.

Why not take it in AT THE SAME TIME AS HER BOOKBAG?!?!? Her bookbag is obv being left, her homework and supplies she needs every day is in it.\n\nHave you tried telling your niece to put it in her bookbag or pick up her coat at the same time as her bookbag?

Here in FL, ten years ago we had forty degree weather and they made school voluntary that day. Meaning, if you did NOT go to school, you were not marked absent. If you went, nothing important was covered, it was treated almost like a snow day. \n\nOther than that, is it possible for OP to make an agreement with the Homeroom teacher? Keep a jacket/coat there permanently in the wardrobe for her? She gets there in a bunch of sweaters, get put in the coat for recess, bundled back into swaters AND the coat for the outside wait, then simply remove the coat and keep it in the wardrobe when a parent arrives at the pick up line. It sounds more complicated than it is, I know, lol. Pain in the ass for the kid and the teacher, but that kid NEEDS to retain her schedule. Her grades will also drop due to attendance, even if she does all her work.", ">I think this is a clear everyone sucks\n\nI agree with you on ESH. Next time you need to contact a parent in an emergency, CALL her. I'll never understand why people think a text message is sufficient in an urgent situation. \\[Yes, I notice that you called her the first time, you should have called her again when you changed her mind.\\]\n\nI'm also more than a little concerned that the reason you didn't take your niece out without a coat in 16-degree weather had more to do with your negative feelings about your sister than the welfare of your niece, and that your sister still would have wanted you to take her to school. If you \\*had\\* taken her to school in that weather without a coat, your niece would probably be picked up by her father and staying there full-time, with orders not to let you \\[or her mother\\] be involved in pickup and dropoff.", "ESH (except for the niece).  The kid needs to go to school and it's not cool to just not take her when you are there and able to take her.   At the same time, her parents need to make sure she has everything she needs for school all set.    \n\n\nThe more appropriate course of action is to take her in and tell her mom \"I told you I can't deal with the coat issue.

I\u2019m assuming the kid has a back pack.. so who grabs that out of the car?", "NTA for sure. This is definitely not a everyone sucks thing. You are doing your sister a HUGE favour. \n\nLack of proper warm weather gear can be seriously harmful to a child. What happens if there is an emergency e.g. fire and everyone needs to evacuate or even just a fire drill? Your poor niece will be forced outside with nothing", "NTA you told her you won\u2019t take her if she didn\u2019t have a coat.", "NTA.  It's the parents' responsibility to make she is ready.", "NTA, your highest priority was for your niece's physical health. You didn't leave her without childcare, either - you kept niece home with you, safe and warm. This way niece was in no danger. \n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with both of niece's parents, and your sister owes you an apology for yelling at you.\n\nI think that you could set a new rule that you keep two of niece's coats at your place at any given time - maybe soften the blow by buying 1 emergency back-up coat as a gift for niece. \n\nThat way, when niece shows up without a coat, you can send her to school in Coat A and still have Coat B as a back up. Then you remind her parents to drop her off with TWO coats tomorrow morning. This gives you a cushion of 1 more forgotten coat before niece misses school.

She needs to wake tf up. \n\nFurthermore, your niece could end up getting seriously sick if she has to spend so much time in drastically cold weather without a coat.

I have no other negative feelings toward her. We're very loving and get along great. \n\nThe reason I didn't take my niece to school was that I wasn't taking a 5 year old out in 16 degree weather.

It's not fair for her to have to face the judgement from the school for something that's outside of her control.", "Where I live it\u2019s cold in the morning but by the afternoon after school it\u2019s a lot warmer. This morning it was in the 20s and right now it\u2019s in the 50s. \n\nBut 5 is old enough to bring their coat inside in the afternoon. Will take a week or 2 of reminders but they\u2019ll get in the routine soon enough.", "Or they could live somewhere where it's 16 in the morning when the sun is barely up, and 40 by 3pm when she's coming home.

I have no idea where OP lives.)", "I have access from my garage to the house so I actually just pull in my garage, close it and walk directly into the house without stepping outside.

Either way, the mother should be making sure everything niece needs for school the next day should be unloaded and ready to go for the morning.", "That's really generous of you. It's not your responsibility to purchase extra weather-appropriate clothing for a child who isn't your own. It sounds like they're taking advantage of you. Also I hope they paid you back for that coat.", "Yeah, they probably have a garage. My bias is that I have a detached garage, HATE the cold, and would never leave out of my house in winter without FULL GEAR on. Even if it's to let my dog out to wee on the lawn, haha.", "Well, yes but not by much. But this is coming from someone who HATES the cold and would love it if it never dropped below 50 F, haha", "Right! I'm saying once they get HOME from school, they are not putting her coat back on her. How do they not notice that she doesn't have her coat on? Unless they are pulling into a heated garage or something, haha. Probably projecting my \"detached garage\" experience and my hating the cold. I wouldn't make it from the garage to my house in 16 degree weather without my coat!", "do they send them out to play in the cold though?", "That depends where you live. It was 26 F this morning when I left for work and it's 51 F now. It's not unusual for the temperature to change 20-30 degrees over the course of a day here. My brother lived in Denver for a while and one day it was 30 in the morning and 80 in the afternoon.", "yes, that's why they have to wear proper gear to school. If kid dressed inappropriately, they'll have to sit by themselves outside the principal's office while the teacher takes everyone else out.\n\nAt my kid's school they would not put up with this more than once. You would be called to pick kid up/bring proper winter clothes. If you didn't, a social worker would be involved.", "Ha. Not at my kid's school and we are in the south.

The situation is a bit different in NJ; the schools here have shorter days for K kids and they don't assign daily homework -- possibly to reflect the current 10 minute homework rule endorsed by the National Education Association. I understand that some places don't follow these recommendations, however, though I didn't realize that it was still widespread in the present day. It's a bit outrageous that there are still school districts which are overworking their students at the very beginning of their school careers.", "The kinder in AZ is about an hour shorter than what we experienced in Okinawa, where their day length was the same as the rest of the elementary school grades. A fair amount of it can differ by teacher as well. For instance,  my older son's first grade teacher in Oki didn't give any homework despite him being used to it from kinder. She didn't believe in it and sourced the grades for it from other work. \n\nTo come back to the point, however,  yes, this coat less child could have had learning materials in her bag as well.

Her primary focus should be the well-being of her daughter, which includes a coat in Sub-Zero weather.", "NTA. You are only looking out for your niece, something that neither of her parents are taking responsibility for. I wouldn't take my kids out in 16 degree weather without a coat. The parents need to each be responsible enough to make sure the child takes her coat out of their car, or they need to do it for her. If they won't do either, they don't get to get angry with you for seeing to the well-being of their daughter.", "NTA.  Your sister is a passive aggressive angry woman.

Even if you have a 2023 car, it could break down or have an accident and your niece could actually die from exposure. When you live in a state that gets those kinds of temperatures, winter jackets are a necessity not an option. My granddaughter decided last fall to refuse to wear her jacket to school. It was around 15 degrees and wouldn\u2019t be very warm that day. High was forecasted at 25 degrees. I drive 2 blocks and I still had her jacket with she just refused it.

Easy solution, don\u2019t take your niece to school (does she even pay you?), because your sister & BIL are lazy, inconsiderate parents. C\u2019mon now, as a parent, I couldn\u2019t imagine not doing this one simple, basic thing, it literally would take 1-2 seconds to make sure their child\u2019s coat comes into the house w/their child & also teach their child to grab her coat, backpack etc", "NTA  \nThe parents are the assholes!

Even the school is addressing it, and your sister is still sending her without a coat. She's either completely incompetent or being dense on purpose when it comes to the simple task of bringing a coat inside. I wouldn't even say you were being petty. You were saving yourself the embarrassment of dropping your niece off, yet again, without a coat. Something the school staff have essentially reprimanded you for, repeatedly. Maybe your sister should realize that you're doing her a massive favor and stop acting like she's the same age as her daughter.", "NTA. This is carelessness and laziness.

The rest of the family can take turns taking niece to school.", "If there\u2019s not a long walk it\u2019s not a big deal.

It doesn't solve the big problem.", "My kids won't wear coats to leave the house if it's above freezing and my oldest will wear shorts until it's in the 30's.  I wouldn't spend a ton of time outside in 16 degree weather (like a kindergartener would at an early recess) but I couldn't be bothered to put on my coat to walk across the street to my house from school if it was above zero.  Your body really does adjust to a certain point to the climate where you live.", "I\u2019m so glad to hear that!", "I know it doesn't solve the parents hoarding coats. But I thought in combination with another person's suggestion of having a \"school coat\" that doesn't get sent home, it at least gets the niece to school and on the playground warmly. If the parents have coats in the car, they can bring it to the building when they pick up their daughter. It's all too much effort, coordination, and inefficiency when the parents could just remember a coat though.", "Wow, I just realized that you've lived in Japan, Austria, Italy, Texas, Arizona and Virgina, if not more locations.

This is not rocket science.", "I get there at 6 and my sister is usually rushing out the door to get to work on time. I accidentally said she works at 6 bit she's actually leaving at 6.

Not worth it most of the time.", "I mean, the coats have to come off in a car seat, anyway. If they're going from a warm house to a car that's been running a bit, they'll get colder while I'm fussing getting the coat off, while the heat escapes the car, than they would if I just let them out the door without a coat on. I always bring the coats with us and throw them in the car, though, in case it breaks down. There were days growing up I just didn't wear my coat at all and carried it with me. \n\nI'd honestly lean towards N A H if things were like they were when I was growing up. OP has a valid concern, and I couldn't blame her even if niece wasn't in danger, but 30 seconds going from a warm house, to a warm car, to a warm(ish) school really isn't the end of the world, even for a five year old. 16 degrees is FRIGID, but if she's bundled in sweaters and hauls it inside, she'd be okay. Be a whole different story if she was catching the bus, but she's driven to and from. But when I was growing up, they kept us inside if it got lower than 55, so if I forgot my coat or refused to bring it, it wasn't the end of the world. Now, at least at my daughter's school, they get them out unless it's BITTER. Like, temperatures threatening frostbite in five seconds, \"why is school even open?\" bitterly cold. Which means niece is probably sitting inside at recess, and that SUCKS for her far more than just being cold for thirty seconds. \n\nWhich puts me in a NTA judgement for OP, and I think after thinking it over, I'd have arrived there anyway. Her sister and niece's dad need to get their heads outta their asses and make sure she has her coat for school and the car ride. But even outside of recess, what if OP's car broke down? What if they had to evacuate the school? I remember when I was in elementary, one of the older kids pulled the fire alarm, and we had to evacuate. We couldn't go back inside for at least half an hour, and it was 20\u00b0 outside. My class was at special, so none of us had our coats, and most of us weren't even wearing sweatshirts, because the school was really warm that day and we'd been doing something very active before the alarm went off. We were FREEZING, but had to wait for the fire department to clear the school. Kiddo needs a coat with her for school.", "Lunch bag then", " :(", "It's not about a few meters in the morning. The daycare/school will send kids outside for recess, so she will need a coat then. Also, what happens if there's a fire or a fire drill?

Shoes - check. etc etc etc  \n\n\nThey are at best lazy, at worst negligent parents for not caring if their daughter has a coat to wear to school.", "NTA  It's certainly not going to kill a 5 year old to miss one day of kindergarten when it's 16 degrees out.  Your sister needs a plan.  Either buy a few more coats so they have backup until they collect up the car coats, or when the kid takes off her coat, she hands it to her parent, or a big note on the front door of the house that says \"DID YOU BRING IN THE COAT???\" Or whatever.  Basically your sister should act like the situation actually mattered to her and do whatever is necessary to get it under control.  Maybe having her daughter miss school is the kick in the Ass she needs to start doing that.", "Really just the parents suck. Like wow.", ">I don't know why she's blowing up and telling everyone,\n\nAtleast when the niece unfortunately gets sick and hospitalised everyone will know it's because the parents were to lazy to make sure she had a coat. That said they will probably all blame OP for taking niece out to get sick in the first place. No matter what OP does here it's a lose, lose, lose situation so they should just take the 3loss option and be the bad guy for not helping out at all.", "They could have a garage with a direct entrance to the house.  Who knows?  But she is definitely not even trying.", "I don't know if it's still the same, or if it's just emailed now, but my child had a communication book that went home each day at least. For things like \"child fell in mud, please wash and return/replace spare clothing. Tomorrow we're doing this random theme day, field trip, pizza day. PLEASE SEND APPROPRIATE WINTER CLOTHING WITH YOUR CHILD.\"", "So what! It\u2019s still cold in the morning, 16 degrees!Children go outside during the school day. The teachers and principal has said something. She needs her coats!!\n\nNTA", "My kindergartener brings home a homework folder each Monday. It's not an onerous amount of homework (5 mins per night), and there is no penalty for not doing it, but it exists. I don't hate it and neither does she. Shrug. (I did not have homework until 3rd/4th grade and thought I'd feel more strongly about it, but I don't.)", "It's really not the walk from car to house, or school to car that's the issue. If there have been 30 instances of this issue this year, for OP, it's safe to assume that they live in an area that has like, actual winters. Most places that have a whole season with near freezing temps that coincides with pretty much half of the school year, still send kids outside for recess in those freezing temperatures. 5 year olds need to be supervised at all times, so someone is having to look after her inside while the rest of the class is outside.", "Yeah but the parents will probably be too lazy to remember and will probably just grab the \"school coat\" and take it home cause \"it's nieces coat anyway\".", "NTA. Your sister is not innocent. She should make sure her kid is well taken care of and has her basic necessities met.", "NTA poor kid", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re the only one who is trying to be responsible. It\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t have access to your niece\u2019s parent\u2019s coats to hide them so they can see how much it sucks being outside in the freezing cold without proper clothing. Might teach them a lesson.", "In 16 degree weather?! NTA (I\u2019m assuming this is 16F and not 16C because a kid should be fine in a sweater at 16C but that\u2019s not freezing weather)\n\nIt does sound like angry words were exchanged and maybe that part wasn\u2019t handled the best. But, it\u2019s not like you left your niece unsupervised. Her mom and dad didn\u2019t provide you the things needed to keep their daughter safe going to school, so you kept her safe at home. After you warned them that was your plan. That seems like a reasonable choice.\n\nI get forgetting a coat ONCE (at which point, keeping her home was reasonable). But again and again? That\u2019s tremendously irresponsible, and, frankly, neglectful, in such cold weather.\n\nI would honestly expect the school to call CPS if it keeps happening.", "NTA it is neglect to send a kid to school with no coat in that weather. She is 5 your sister and her dad are very irresponsible! The school will eventually call CPS on them if they are not careful.", "maybe keep a jacket in your car just for her. Or one of the jackets that belong to her in your car at all times. Other than that, id' stop too.", "Nta\u2026. I drop my kids off at my parents house at 6 am every morning the night before I pack their bag ( uniform shoes coats in the morning I add water bottles and pack lunches) your sister is just being lazy does she not empty her car when she gets home like coat back pack etc there is no excuse I\u2019ve occasionally forgotten my kids tie but mum has a spare key to call in to my house on the way to school for it", "NTA. Your sister is being lazy and a shitty parent. You warned her. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Also, I feel like as an adult if you\u2019re wearing a coat or bringing a coat with you as you leave the house - that should be the lightbulb that oh \u201ckid will need a coat today too.\u201d Some parents just don\u2019t have it together (I work at a school and it happens more often that I\u2019d like to see). We keep extra fleeces in the closet for kids to wear at recess.", "This is a Cps call. The teachers don\u2019t want to do it so they sent out a letter. If it keeps happening they have to report. You did your sister a favor. It\u2019s abuse to expect a kid to suffer in 16 degree weather with no coat. I\u2019m in Montana. I kept 10 coats on hand because my kids dad did this to me.", "NTA! You seem to be the only one concerned about making sure your niece is dressed for the weather. \n\nMinnesotan here: We are geared up here for any weather that Mother Nature can throw at us. We have coats/hats/scarves/gloves for EVERY season. And especially for children! Coat drives are a regular and endorsed charity option for kids here who need them. Safety first! Anything can happen and usually does! \n\nGood job making sure your niece is protected! They needed a wake-up call badly. Lazy parenting. :(", "You\u2019re NTA! And stand your ground until your sisters family learns!", "16 degrees is like tshirt weather where I am lol"]}
