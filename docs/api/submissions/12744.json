I wake up at 5:15AM to get ready and drive over to my sister's house. It's a hassle but I love doing this, she's the cutest sweetest kid and it's bonding time.\n\nThe issue is that I take her to school but I'm not in charge of picking her up, that's on her parents (split up but co-parent well). Frequently my niece will take whatever coat she's wearing off in their car after school on the drive home. For whatever reason, her parents never remember to bring her coats in and they all end up left in their 2 cars. This becomes a problem for me at 7:15 when I try to take her to school and realize there's no coats. I've been forced to bundle her up in 3-4 layers of sweaters in below freezing weather. I've complained to my sister and niece's dad multiple times. Administrators sent out multiple emails to remind parents (aka specifically my sister but they try to be niece and send it to everyone) that kids need to be wearing coats in the morning. Twice in January the principle reminded me when I dropped her off in the morning (there's always a principle.or receptionists to greet each Kindergardener at the back door). It's embarrassing to drop off a 5 year old in freezing weather with no coat, and my niece shouldn't have to freeze in the AM. \n\nLast month I told my sister that she needs to either teach my niece to carry her coat in or she needs to do it herself, but that if it happens again I won't take her to school. \n\nIt was 16 degrees Friday AM, and I go to leave the house with her - no coat. I called my sister to ask her where her coat is and she said they're all in their cars. I was angry and hung up on her and went to get sweaters. Then I changed my mind and texted my sister that she can either take an hour off work to bring me a coat or I'm keeping my niece home with me but I'm not taking her out in 16 degree weather without a coat. My sister didn't see the message until 9AM and she called me absolutely furious that I didn't just take her to school. I told her that I was sick of going out of my way to take her daughter to school all the time and she couldn't even give me the basic courtesy of making sure I had what I needed to get her to school. This has caused a riff between is the last few days and family is split about who is the AH. I think this is a clear everyone sucks - I'll admit I was trying to be petty to teach her a lesson - but some people think my sister is basically innocent and I broke her trust.

You were specifically following the school's rules.  They weren't happy with your niece showing up without a coat, and would have also been upset.  The school was telling them that you couldn't bring her without a coat, and you were telling them you couldn't bring her without a coat, and she didn't have a coat, and you didn't bring her.\n\nThat's not even petty, or cruel, or snarky, or anything.  That's just the simple if-then algorithm of following the rules.  You weren't ALLOWED to take her without a coat.  I mean, they would have let it slide, because what else could they do, especially since it wasn't your fault, but you were doing what the school wanted you to do.", "Nta. They are taking advantage of you.", "NTA. That is so embarrassing and way too cold for just sweaters.", "NTA. Your sister is. You're the responsible one and going out of your way for your niece, the least your sister can do is leave a jacket for her daughter. This is borderline neglect on her part.", "NTA. They let it slide because you've taken the time to layer her up with sweaters and it hasn't been a problem with them until you rightfully put your foot down.", "NTA--this is just poor planning on her part.

Why not take it in AT THE SAME TIME AS HER BOOKBAG?!?!? Her bookbag is obv being left, her homework and supplies she needs every day is in it.\n\nHave you tried telling your niece to put it in her bookbag or pick up her coat at the same time as her bookbag?

You warned her it would happen. You aren't the TA for following thru.

They\u2019re taking advantage of you. You did the right thing.", "NTA- sounds like you care more about her then her own parents.

Here in FL, ten years ago we had forty degree weather and they made school voluntary that day. Meaning, if you did NOT go to school, you were not marked absent. If you went, nothing important was covered, it was treated almost like a snow day. \n\nOther than that, is it possible for OP to make an agreement with the Homeroom teacher? Keep a jacket/coat there permanently in the wardrobe for her? She gets there in a bunch of sweaters, get put in the coat for recess, bundled back into swaters AND the coat for the outside wait, then simply remove the coat and keep it in the wardrobe when a parent arrives at the pick up line. It sounds more complicated than it is, I know, lol. Pain in the ass for the kid and the teacher, but that kid NEEDS to retain her schedule. Her grades will also drop due to attendance, even if she does all her work.", ">I think this is a clear everyone sucks\n\nI agree with you on ESH. Next time you need to contact a parent in an emergency, CALL her. I'll never understand why people think a text message is sufficient in an urgent situation. \\[Yes, I notice that you called her the first time, you should have called her again when you changed her mind.\\]\n\nI'm also more than a little concerned that the reason you didn't take your niece out without a coat in 16-degree weather had more to do with your negative feelings about your sister than the welfare of your niece, and that your sister still would have wanted you to take her to school. If you \\*had\\* taken her to school in that weather without a coat, your niece would probably be picked up by her father and staying there full-time, with orders not to let you \\[or her mother\\] be involved in pickup and dropoff.", "ESH (except for the niece).  The kid needs to go to school and it's not cool to just not take her when you are there and able to take her.   At the same time, her parents need to make sure she has everything she needs for school all set.    \n\n\nThe more appropriate course of action is to take her in and tell her mom \"I told you I can't deal with the coat issue.

I might have brought an extra jacket of my own though, but it\u2019s still not the same lol \nShe needs her own jacket and to be warm instead of piles of sweaters that won\u2019t really do anything because it\u2019s 16 degrees. The parents are capable of grabbing all the jackets when they get home and bring them inside and remind their kid to grab their things. I\u2019m assuming the kid has a back pack.. so who grabs that out of the car?", "NTA for sure. This is definitely not a everyone sucks thing. You are doing your sister a HUGE favour. \n\nLack of proper warm weather gear can be seriously harmful to a child. What happens if there is an emergency e.g. fire and everyone needs to evacuate or even just a fire drill? Your poor niece will be forced outside with nothing", "NTA you told her you won\u2019t take her if she didn\u2019t have a coat.", "NTA.  It's the parents' responsibility to make she is ready.", "NTA, your highest priority was for your niece's physical health. You didn't leave her without childcare, either - you kept niece home with you, safe and warm. This way niece was in no danger. \n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with both of niece's parents, and your sister owes you an apology for yelling at you.\n\nI think that you could set a new rule that you keep two of niece's coats at your place at any given time - maybe soften the blow by buying 1 emergency back-up coat as a gift for niece. \n\nThat way, when niece shows up without a coat, you can send her to school in Coat A and still have Coat B as a back up. Then you remind her parents to drop her off with TWO coats tomorrow morning. This gives you a cushion of 1 more forgotten coat before niece misses school.

She needs to wake tf up. \n\nFurthermore, your niece could end up getting seriously sick if she has to spend so much time in drastically cold weather without a coat.

I have no other negative feelings toward her. We're very loving and get along great. \n\nThe reason I didn't take my niece to school was that I wasn't taking a 5 year old out in 16 degree weather.

I don\u2019t know what other actions you could take at this point.", "NTA\n\nthe school wants their students healthy and warm. i didn't have a coat one day for my kids because it was in the car and the school was ready to send me resources for coats because it was at the start of the season. i let the teacher know and we are good about ensuring the coats are ready the night before now. and we got one back up coat each child just in case one has to go to the wash.", "NTA you sound very caring.\n\nn.b. \n\nrift\r - a crack, split, or break in something.\n\nNOT\n\nriff - a short repeated phrase in popular music and jazz, typically used as an introduction or refrain in a song", "NTA. Stop taking her altogether, they're using you.", "NTA - They can\u2019t be bothered because you are doing all the work for them.   You did the right thing.", "NTA, they are lazy and terrible parents. Every parent has a routine of things to do every night to make sure the morning goes smoothly. Your sister not doing the bare minimum is just careless and useless parent. You don\u2019t need to deal with that.", "OP this is beyond giving you courtesy, this is parental neglect. Them not behaving like responsible parents is a big problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, but could you get them to keep a coat at daycare for her? Should really be her parents doing that though.", "NTA. Your sister and her husband are just lazy and completely irresponsible. It\u2019s not hard to bring a little kid\u2019s coat in from the car.", "NTA that's lazy parents", "NTA. Your response was wise and just. (As an education administrator, I can say that ultimately we're forced to record how often students present at school without bare necessities. Its the means we use to direct potential aid to families who need additional resources.) Sorry your sister and former BIL are having trouble adulting. But, this has a simple fix. Just look in the back seat every time you get out of your car and then remind your child to grab her coat.", "NTA, and you weren't being petty to teach her a lesson. You were making a responsible decision for a child whose parents are slacking and taking advantage of your kindness. I know it takes a village, but this totally irresponsible of your sister. Your niece deserves more from her mom.", "NTA.  Anyone who backs her should be asked why they are supporting neglectful parents.  That is exactly what they are, neglectful.  They have coats, they neglect their child\u2019s health and safety by expecting her to wear clothing inappropriate for the outside temperature.", "Nta..the school are saying they are TA with their letter. Their CHILD could get sick and they would clearly blame you. Better off out of it.", "Can you walk your niece in, and then take (and keep) the coat?  Then a coat shortage becomes her parents' problem when they go to pick her up.  Or would that cause an issue at recess?", "The child missed a day of kindergarten rather than present with no coat, hat, mittens and scarf? If that's what it takes to get parents to pull their heads out - so be it.", "Also, OP, each time you were spoken to by the principal you should have told them this info and asked them to directly reach out to *both* parents. Sometimes people listen to \"authority\" over family. Might not have worked but it's not your fault so there's no use taking responsibility for it.", "> If the child is in the car and taking off her coat, why not put it in her bookbag? Why not take it in AT THE SAME TIME AS HER BOOKBAG?!?!? Her bookbag is obv being left, her homework and supplies she needs every day is in it.\n\nSince when does kindergarten come with books, school supplies and *homework*? The only thing to bring along is lunch and mid morning/afternoon snacks (and a coat, obviously), unless y'all do some weird shit in kindergarten in the US.", "Op stated she drives to her sister house. Sister is not dropping her off.", "I was assuming they are parking in an attached garage", "I mean, that could only be a couple of metres. I definitely let my 3yo walk from the car to the house without a jacket on when there's snow on the ground. We're not outside for long.", "If the car is right by the house I don't see the issue. I have my kids run to the car and get in without coats because big winter coats shouldn't be on kids in car seats, it's not safe. If they're walking a fair distance to the car absolutely put coats on, but a few meters? Nah.", "We do weird shit in the US. Even 25 years ago we had number/letter identification, penmanship and sight word worksheets sent home as homework.", "It\u2019s not much stuff but ours has her backpack everyday she brings her snack and has a couple folders for notes to from teacher and papers she\u2019s finished to bring home.", "Ahh. Makes sense now.", "At least you won\u2019t have to see or deal with your niece ever again"]}
