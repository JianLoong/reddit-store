Growing up, she was always the favorite child of the family. She was treated better and given priority in everything.

They bought her a brand new car for one of her birthdays, but they never bought me a car. Well that sets the context.\n\nMy sister and a few of her friends are planning to go on a vacation on an expensive cruise for a week to celebrate their high school graduation. She's really close with them- they've been friends since elementary school. However a couple months ago my dad got laid off, and he's still looking for a job. My mom's job doesn't pay much, so we're mostly living off savings (which is limited) right now. We have enough money for my sister to go on vacation with her friends, but then that would mean there's more than likely not enough money for me to finish my college education. \n\nI have a tuition waiver scholarship, and I'm willing to get loans to pay for my education (though it's unlikely I can get enough loans to cover all the fees), and I'm fine with commuting from home next year, which again will be tricky because I don't have my own car. It's cheaper than on campus or off campus living but gas, insurance, and parking is still quite costly in our place. Not to mention there's a bunch of required on campus fees. Unfortunately I didn't get a summer internship and I'm taking online classes, so I won't have the money to pay for my education myself. I'm graduating in 3 years, so I just have one more year of college.\n\nAnyways, my family had a discussion about our financial situation, and my sister said that she does not want to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime experience with her closest friends. My parents said that because it means a lot to her, they are willing to pay for her vacation. I pointed out my college situation and said that if she goes on vacation with her friends, it is unlikely that we can afford to pay for necessary college expenses next year no matter how much I try to cut down. I said that I worked very hard to finish 2/3 of my degree. My dad said that I can take a year off school and get a full time job, and hopefully he can get a job again. I said that it will be very complicated if I take a year off school, and that I didn't want to delay my college graduation. My mom said I was being immature and inconsiderate, and that I would still graduate in 4 years, but this vacation means everything to my sister, so I should make the sacrifice so she can enjoy her last moments with her best friends. I asked my parents if they value my education. They said they do, but they also value my sister. Then I told them that my sister should not go on vacation, because it will mess up my academic and graduation plans.

Do you have any family members you can talk to about this?", "NTA but can you work over the summer until the semester starts in the fall?

End result, I had a much harder life & worse career paths than they did.\n\nNot only are you \"Not the Asshole\" but it sounds like your parents are \"Typically spoiling the Baby Girl at the expense of the older boy\" which happens a LOT in the US especially. FYI, I'm the OLDEST of 5 (4 boys youngest is a girl) so \"I got all the shit, & they got all the gravy.\" It happens.\n\nSo, No, You're \"NTA.\" DON'T \"expect your folks or your Sis to see it that way, or to *change their behavior in any way,\"* as a result of that fact, though? Not likely to happen, either.\n\nBest thing I can say is for you to try to Get A Job of any sort, so you can work through the summer, & get some of Your OWN cash saved up to help get through your last year.\n\nSadly, with how it's gone in your family already, most likely that's \"how *It's going to continue to go.\"* Sad but true.

It sounds like your parents (implicitly or explicitly) agreed to finance your education.

Unfortunately, it's their decision. I wish you the best.", "Wow, absolutely NTA. College is a responsible decision that you've been working hard at and you're already making sacrifices.\nVacations, while fun, are not a necessity. This is a completely unfair expectation of them to say you should sacrifice your school so she can be spoiled. \nWhen finances are tight, the WHOLE family should pitch in and do what they can. She needs to learn she isn't the center of the world before she gets out in the real world and learns the hard way.\n\nMy advice is calmly stand your ground and get out of there as soon as you can be financially independent. Family is important, but toxic is toxic. At the end of the day, your responsibility is first to your own health; physical, emotional, mental, etc", "NTA.  I would shame your parents to all your family and friends that they think a cruise is more important than your education.  And give details to everyone about the favoritism shown.

You need to get a job, save some money and leave.  Move into a roommate situation that won't use up all your money. You are lucky they paid for 2/3 of your degree.

If she goes on the cruise, you lose financially. If she doesn't go on the cruise, you lose time and energy putting up with their ongoing abuse. The three of them are not as smart as you are, and that is not your fault. While you are in college, you have far more important and valuable things to do with your time than get sucked into this trio's sick dynamic 24/7. I hope you can put up healthy boundaries between them and you today and every day from now on until it becomes your life's way to live a healthy and independent life with time to heal from all they have done to you.

Your frusteration and anger are based upon years of built up double standards.\n\nThat said, are they paying for her college education? What are her plans after graduation and how will they be paid for?\n\nIf your parents had promised to pay for your education and are now renigging on it in order to pay for a cruise for your sister, that is not okay. \n\nThat said, your parents are AHs for not making you and your sister get jobs as soon as it was clear money was tight.

There's some cheap ones near me that run $400 bucks for almost a week, but there's also the $2000 per person for a week and then like you said, depends on what you add. But I mean if it's a couple hundred bucks, I don't think they should be spending it at this time, but it's not going to make a difference to OPs education funds. But if it's 10k, well, I would be pissed too. But is sister not going to college after this?", "Or how about OP put on his big boy britches and get a job for HIS expenses? He can't rely on Mommy and Daddy anymore.", "Husband and I cruised in February for 7 days. A club balcony suite, airfare, insurance, tips, and 3 excursions each cost approximately $5000 total. If the friends are sharing a room, then costs would be less. If each friend gets their own room, higher costs.\n\nCruise pricing is very subjective. The room, number of people in the room, add ons, time of year, duration. They all play a major role in determining the price.", "And sissy can?", "And the choice of cruise line makes a huge cost difference as well."]}
