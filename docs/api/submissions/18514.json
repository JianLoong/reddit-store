She's really close with them- they've been friends since elementary school. However a couple months ago my dad got laid off, and he's still looking for a job. My mom's job doesn't pay much, so we're mostly living off savings (which is limited) right now.

It's cheaper than on campus or off campus living but gas, insurance, and parking is still quite costly in our place. Not to mention there's a bunch of required on campus fees. Unfortunately I didn't get a summer internship and I'm taking online classes, so I won't have the money to pay for my education myself. I'm graduating in 3 years, so I just have one more year of college.\n\nAnyways, my family had a discussion about our financial situation, and my sister said that she does not want to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime experience with her closest friends. My parents said that because it means a lot to her, they are willing to pay for her vacation. I pointed out my college situation and said that if she goes on vacation with her friends, it is unlikely that we can afford to pay for necessary college expenses next year no matter how much I try to cut down. I said that I worked very hard to finish 2/3 of my degree. My dad said that I can take a year off school and get a full time job, and hopefully he can get a job again. I said that it will be very complicated if I take a year off school, and that I didn't want to delay my college graduation. My mom said I was being immature and inconsiderate, and that I would still graduate in 4 years, but this vacation means everything to my sister, so I should make the sacrifice so she can enjoy her last moments with her best friends.

Are they gonna pay for both educations.", "So I\u2019m not putting a judgement here but why wouldn\u2019t you be able to get student loans? I just looked it up and this is the requirements list I found\n\nDemonstrate financial need (for most loan programs)\n\nBe a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen\n\nHave a valid Social Security number (exceptions are made for students from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau)\n\nBe enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible degree or certificate program\n\nEnroll at least half-time (for Direct Loan eligibility)\n\nMaintain satisfactory academic progress\n\nCertify that you are not in default on a federal student loan, do not owe money on a federal student grant, and will use the loan only for educational purposes\n\nShow that you\u2019re qualified to obtain a college or career school education because you\u2019ve completed high school or a GED program\n\nSo unless your grades are really tanking, you should be able to get a loan, and if you\u2019re tanking that bad, maybe a break would be good. It sucks that your parents have to pick and choose but I can see both sides and don\u2019t feel a lot of sympathy for either, especially since a lot of kids don\u2019t get any help from their parents with college at all.", "NAH. \n\nWhile getting an education is far more important than a trip, your sister is only 17 and it would be nice to give her the same opportunities you would've gotten at that age before the job loss.\n\nYour sister isn't an adult yet. You are. Get a part time job.", "YTA she's a kid you are an adult- real world sucks - get used to it", "NTA. Whew your parents suck massively. Without their financial support, what is really keeping you in their lives?", "It\u2019s utterly infuriating that your parents are willing to pay for a luxury vacation for your sister, while leaving you to fend for yourself.", "NTA and your parents suck...like really badly. Why were you even included in the discussion when your side is no value to them. They should sell her car, give both of you a used car and they should not let her go on a cruise. Education is far more important than a vacation. They are favoring the golden child and you know it.", "NTA, but your family sure are. Of course education is more important than some vacation and when you compare this to stuff your sister has already been given it just wouldnt be fair or smart to pay for a holiday", "NTA, I'm not saying you should go NC with them, but I hope you are aware that you cannot rely on them to help you.", "NTA a cruise is NOT a once in a lifetime event she\u2019ll have plenty of chances down the road.", "NTA, and as soon as you finish your degree and get a job, go no contact. This is appalling favouritism. I can\u2019t absolutely see them looking to you to fund their living expenses and your sisters expenses in the future - stand strong.", "NTA, so they think her going on a holiday is more important than a colleague education", "a trip with one\u2019s friends is NOT a once in a lifetime event. i hate your family and i\u2019m so sorry. NTA", "NTA. Remember how you feel right now. When you graduate and are making good money they will ask you to help them. This day will come back, these feelings resurface and thats when you tell them you are going on vacation.", "Wow\u2026.your family Sucks.\n\nThey value a vacation over your future? \n\nWhy didn\u2019t the golden princess get of her pampered hiny and earn her own money for her vacation? \n\nNTA.", "\u201cSpending her last moments with her best friends\u201d what are they all moving to a remote village in fucking Siberia? What kind of bullshit over-dramatic nonsense is that? They\u2019re just trying to manipulate you, OP. Make you feel like you\u2019re depriving your sister of something even tho in all reality it\u2019s their fault they can\u2019t afford it in the first place. What\u2019s next, are they gonna blame you and the cost of pursuing your education for your sister missing out on spending a week on a boat with her friends?", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH. You know how shitty your family dynamics are and how they don\u2019t support you. You should be working on being independent from them. I survived with no help and work study.", ">Then I told them that my sister should not go on vacation, because it will mess up my academic and graduation plans. And my parents and sister all got furious and called me selfish.\n\n'You are selfish because you care about your education and have academic and graduarion plans, while your sister wants to go on a cruiser vacation'\n\nYeah, NTA. But youre parents and sister surely are. I realy can't belive the level of stupidity and selfishness they have. \n\nBest of lucks to you OP hope you can graduate as soon as you can!", "\"if the roles were reversed would you be paying for me to go on the cruise or sending her to college?\"", "I\u2019m so sorry OP!  NTA but your parents surely take the AH cake.", "Info: does your sister have any kind of college or other higher education plans? If so, how will that be paid for?", "It honestly blows my mind that parents behave like this \u2014 I\u2019m an only child so maybe that\u2019s why I find it so hard to fathom. Definitely NTA. Get outta there as soon as you can OP.", "Totally NTA.  Your parents and sister are TA here with their screwed up thinking plus, I'd be willing to bet, even if your dad gets a good job, everything possible will get invested in whatever your sister decides to do and you will be neglected again for your sister's benefit.\n\nNow, I'm going to be a bit of an AH.  If you are finishing a 4 year degree in 3 years you are amazing, dedicated and hard working.  AH part?  Talk to a military recruiter, my suggestion would be Air Force.  Not only is nearly any job you can think of available in the armed forces, but with the brains and dedication you clearly have you would be a high value recruit and could not only likely get your remaining college paid for, you could likely gain fast track access to an officer's commission and, once you graduate, get away from your abusively negligent family and start a life of your own where you can prove your own worth and be valued for it.", "NTA - Do you have any grandparents that could help out or would try to reason with your parents? If they go through with it, I would go LC or NC and get some therapy. I feel you'll need it to deal with being raised in an unhealthy emotional environment.", "So, let me just recap to check I am understanding this right - your parents expect you to take a year off college to work full time in order to fund your last year of your studues, in order to pay for your 17 year old sister luxury holiday. And you're the selfish one? Not your sister who wants to blow money earmarked for your college on a trip? \n\nWow. Just, wow. I'm so sorry your family is like this. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "Wow. Your parents are awful and really seem to not care about you. To pay for your sister to go on a cruise so you\u2019re unable to finish a college degree. Those priorities are way out of whack. I\u2019ll wait a little while for them to post here that their oldest stopped talking to them for absolutely no reason lol. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve gotta deal with family like this. It\u2019s inexcusable. Why not sell sisters car?  I like that idea", "Nta and you may as well destroy your parents and sister for having that favorite child dynamic\u2026.", "NTA. Their treatment of you is horrible", "Dude your family sounds like hell. Get out of there as fast as you can. NTA", "NTA. However, it's kinda of a moot point if your sister is going to still be 17 on IV this cruise. Cruise lines do not allow unaccompanied minors on without a parent or legal guardian. \n\nYour parents are definitely the AHs for prioritizing a GD cruise over their other child's education though. If for some reason they do this, can they take out a student loan for you? Do you have sympathetic grandparents who can help you?", "NTA and I was just talking about how I came from a family with a golden child and how I've had to go very low contact and no contact with most family now. You can't fix their delusion.\n\nSo finish school as soon as you can whatever it takes and leave them permanently in your dust.", "NTA I hope you get away from them asap. They don't deserve you. Go NC the first chance you get.", "I can't believe what I just read. I am so sorry for how they are prioritizing a vacation over your education. This would be enough for me to go NC with my family if they did this to me. Do everything you can to finish your degree and get away from this toxic home. You are not selfish for wanting to get an education.\n\nNTA", "You actually have to wonder what is wrong with these AH parents that they are putting a cruise over education.", "I know it would be hard for OP but he should leave that house and go NC for a while. They clearly chose to spoil a little brat and the moment their finances are over, his gap year will turn into a five year gap to work so his sister can graduate.\n\nNTA, OP! Get away from those people! They don't deserve you.", "In this situation, they're always going to come up with a reason that they need it.  OP doing a summer job will turn into the family saying that they can't afford to pay for college, but since he's working he can keep working so he can pay for it himself.", "Just straight up don't give any of it to your family at that point tbh. If money gets tight enough that they'd need to borrow from OP then they will have to sell the sister's car first before OP opens up the bank account", ">  (not to give to your sister or family **unless they need it**\n\nIf they need money for bills I would remind them that they valued sister\u2019s vacation over being financially responsible.", "I'm going to add to this because of a comment below, basically OP needs to make sure that any bank account they keep money in was set up by them alone in a bank with no connection to their parents, if a parent opened the bank account for them when younger they may be named on ot and have access to any funds and the bank won't see it as fraud if a parent takes the money OP earned as an adult. A different bank is to be extra safe as I've read a few stories of parents knowing the bank staff and getting access to their offsprings money even though that's shady.", "Even taking brother and college out of the equation... Father lost his job, mom doesn't have much income, living off of savings... Sure baby girls we are going to let you blow up all our reserves on an ONE week expensive cruise... \n\nShe has her parents well trained... \n\nNTA OP...", "Blame and shame, make it known on Facebook and send an email to the family and friends of your parents and sister. \u201cHi all! Unfortunately my parents decided to spend their last money on a vacation for my sister, and by doing so won\u2019t be able to support my final year in college as they promised to do earlier. \nI have looked at alternatives, but there is no way for me to finance and study the last college year.  My parents and sister advice me to withdraw from my education till I can afford it myself, stating my sisters cruise takes priority.\n I\u2019m looking for support to finish my last year of college since I wish to finish my college next year as planned. If you have an idea how I can navigate this situation, I would be very grateful. Please contact me, yours, OP", "OP having a job wouldn\u2019t make parents any less TA in this situation\u2026but it would make them even bigger AHs if OP is working and the sister is not. A teenager who wants to go on a cruise with her friends could be working part time to save some $.", "I used to work for a cruise company and this is absolutely realistic. Dumb, but possible. The penthouse, Owner\u2019s Suite and Wintergarden Suites on the Seabourn boats are 15k-30k per person for a week. Some of the Seven Seas cruises work out to 10-12k per day per person. There are others just as expensive at other companies.", "I mean, it depends on the cruise and where OP lives. University here is pretty cheap (like most of the rest of Europe), compared to the US.\n\nBut from the context of the post, this sounds like a lot of money, so maybe not. Whatever the case, everyone is an AH except OP.", "Judging from your other replies, you're basing your answer on something you know nothing about? And didn't bother to research it to make an informed decision?\n\nAnyway, OP is NTA. And not a liar. My tuition also cost about the same as a one week cruise, specifically the Royal Caribbean International.", "You could say the exact same thing about his sister. She just graduated high school, now the real world starts for her too. The difference between 17 and 18 means absolutely nothing in this context. She\u2019s a kid the same way OP is a kid. She can get used to sometimes missing vacations", "I don\u2019t think you understand the post. OP\u2019s family would be using money they\u2019d already budgeted/set aside for OP\u2019s tuition, to pay for the sister\u2019s vacation. This is after they\u2019ve already given the sister other expensive gifts (like a new car), that they never had money to give OP. Taking away OP\u2019s tuition is putting OP at risk of not being able to finish school. \n\nIf a 17 year old kid wants to go on vacation, she can get a part time job and save up the money, or ask her parents to sell the car they bought her\u2026she doesn\u2019t deserve to fuck up *someone else\u2019s college education* just so she can go on a cruise that she isn\u2019t willing to work for.", "I hope OP graduates as planned and never speaks to these people again. This is nuts. NTA.", "They value HER vacation more than HIS education.", "They\u2019ll demand rent, but only from op.", "And speaking of bank accounts, OP needs to make sure they have their own, not a joint one or one that the parents have custodial access to. I can see the writing on the wall already - OP starts working and money goes missing from the bank account because Mom and Dad needed it for \u201cbills.\u201d", "She also may need to take flights to a port city. Is the cruise all inclusive or not? She\u2019ll need to pay for food if not and possibly other fees or tabs on the cruise.", "And she has enough friends willing to pay that? Doubtful", "Ok. The ways the uber rich can spend money is completely outside my knowledge base. I accept that the possibility exists", "OP is already living with parents, not on campus."]}
