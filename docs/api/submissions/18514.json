She's really close with them- they've been friends since elementary school. However a couple months ago my dad got laid off, and he's still looking for a job. My mom's job doesn't pay much, so we're mostly living off savings (which is limited) right now.

It's cheaper than on campus or off campus living but gas, insurance, and parking is still quite costly in our place. Not to mention there's a bunch of required on campus fees.

I'm graduating in 3 years, so I just have one more year of college.\n\nAnyways, my family had a discussion about our financial situation, and my sister said that she does not want to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime experience with her closest friends. My parents said that because it means a lot to her, they are willing to pay for her vacation. I pointed out my college situation and said that if she goes on vacation with her friends, it is unlikely that we can afford to pay for necessary college expenses next year no matter how much I try to cut down. I said that I worked very hard to finish 2/3 of my degree. My dad said that I can take a year off school and get a full time job, and hopefully he can get a job again. I said that it will be very complicated if I take a year off school, and that I didn't want to delay my college graduation. My mom said I was being immature and inconsiderate, and that I would still graduate in 4 years, but this vacation means everything to my sister, so I should make the sacrifice so she can enjoy her last moments with her best friends.

I would have loved to have even one year paid for.\n\nMaybe they do things unbalanced for his sister and I would understand if it\u2019s always unfair.
