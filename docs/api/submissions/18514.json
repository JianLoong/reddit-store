She's really close with them- they've been friends since elementary school. However a couple months ago my dad got laid off, and he's still looking for a job. My mom's job doesn't pay much, so we're mostly living off savings (which is limited) right now.

It's cheaper than on campus or off campus living but gas, insurance, and parking is still quite costly in our place. Not to mention there's a bunch of required on campus fees.

My parents said that because it means a lot to her, they are willing to pay for her vacation. I pointed out my college situation and said that if she goes on vacation with her friends, it is unlikely that we can afford to pay for necessary college expenses next year no matter how much I try to cut down. I said that I worked very hard to finish 2/3 of my degree. My dad said that I can take a year off school and get a full time job, and hopefully he can get a job again. I said that it will be very complicated if I take a year off school, and that I didn't want to delay my college graduation. My mom said I was being immature and inconsiderate, and that I would still graduate in 4 years, but this vacation means everything to my sister, so I should make the sacrifice so she can enjoy her last moments with her best friends.

If neither you or your family have the resources to have a reliable income and pay for college, maybe take your dad\u2019s advice and get a job.

Lots of people do.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re entitled to money that belongs to your parents.

It really does seem pretty spoiled to feel any ownership over a parents money, let alone the amount of control OP seems to feel he has.\n\n\nI get it. My parents promised me five grand to help buy a house, but when the time came, they had spent it on my sisters art school. It was frustrating, but it was their money.\n\n\nEveryone getting pissy over school vs trip is ignoring that fact. None of them have asked what money the parents have spent on the sister.", "Yup... reason after reason after reason.", "Plus, FB auction, perhaps. I reckon a good number of friends would contribute items.", "I want to know if there's no money for OPs final year of college, is there any money at all for sister's college?\nBecause if not, that changes things a lot.", "EXACTLY. My parents could afford to pay for my college tuition, but they said no.\n\nI didn\u2019t prompt them any further, I\u2019m paying for my entire tuition myself because I\u2019m an adult so I\u2019m willing to work for my own money", "> that the holiday is time limited vs education being able to be deferred and not necessarily hurt by taking a year working full time\n\nNah, she can go on a vacation later (I bet OP didn't get a free cruise for graduating high school), but delaying education by a full year could be a big deal, especially depending on the field he plans to go into. Not only would he miss out on a year's worth of the higher earnings he'd get as a college grad, but he'll always be a year behind in his career compared to where he would have been if he'd graduated when he planned to (e.g., wanna apply for a position where they're looking for 5 years of experience? Gotta wait another year.) If he's able to get a job related to his intended field during the gap year, it might not be too bad, but in a lot of fields itd be tough to find a position like that, since year-long internships aren't exactly common (at least not in the US).", "Why would op need to specifically deconfirm that he got a trip?", "Should they have been given roughly equal money throughout their life, or even him a little more, paying for her trip instead of paying for more of his college starts to become more logical.", "This 100%, Education should come before vacation.", "Op said that sister was always the favorite and even received a car where he didn\u2019t, so I doubt they were given the same amount of money.", "Cars are expensive, but so is college.", "Exactly, but finishing college is more important than a car or going on a cruise.", "Yes it is.\n\nBut also parents have more of an obligation to provide for minor children as opposed to legal adult children who have been living outside the house for 3 years.\n\nThey also have an obligation to try and monetarily make the aid equal between their kids.\n\nEducation loans also typically have lower interest rates than regular loans.", "Providing for children usually doesn\u2019t involve paying for cruises, and if they decided to pay for op\u2019s college and then at the last minute take it away so his sister can live it up off the cost of the Caribbeans, they are flaking out on him and showing that they do in fact favor his sister.", "Yeah, that should tell anyone looking in the situation how high they value one and another kid.", "Yeah it\u2019s above it but the parents shouldn\u2019t be pressured into paying for either.\n\nOP is an adult with no job and no student loans expecting their parents to fund their entire education.\n\nOP needs to take some responsibility and stop relying on his parents (who have low income and are apparently terrible with money) to pay for him.", "Well, shouldn't the 17 year old get a job and pay for the vacation? At least the OP is an intern and actually doing something with their life? They should each pay for themselves, but what if the parents decided to help OP first and at least it's an education and not just wasting the money?", "He should! Because once he gets a job they will say \"we paid for you, now it's time for you to help us pay for your sister!\"\n\nOP better run", "Tell them it\u2019s \u2018karma\u2019.\n\nPronounced \u2018ha, ha - fuck you!\u2019.", "Especially since every cruise line I've ever been on has a minimum age of 21 to book a room."]}
