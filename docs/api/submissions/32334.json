I wouldn't even bother to respond to anything regarding this topic.", "The benefits of a takeaway rather than in-restaurant is that you can eat from a different  menu without anyone kicking off. Or, that's the theory.\n\nSince it sounds like you made them aware that you were ordering from elsewhere, gave them the chance to order, and fetched it yourself, I don't see the issue.

Really?", "NTA and geez, your family needs to get real problems if they're freaking out so much over a food order. It's understandable that you wanted good food and can probably get McD's any day of the week. When they catered the meal to the kids, you didn't even complaint, you just solved the problem.

What you have discovered is that most people cater to their children's wishes and do not require them to eat anything other than junk.
