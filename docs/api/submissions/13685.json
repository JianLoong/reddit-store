This ride home from school is given by one of my parents about 99% of the time (they're both older and pretty much retired so they have the free time). I'm in university currently doing my last year of a pretty heavy science degree. I live at home because my uni is fairly close. My sister thinks that because I live at home and dont have a job this means that I have no responsibilites and infinite free time.

At first she texted me \"heyyyyyy OP can I pleaseeeee get a ride home from school\". she texted me this with around 2 hours before school would be let out so I told her that I wasnt sure because I was at the library but that I would think about it. Around an hour later she texted me again \"I really dont see why you cant give me a ride its not like you have any real obligations\" I responded with basiclaly the same thing saying, \"im not sure if I can\". Finally about a half hour before school let out she said \"OP its literally freezing out dont be an ass and drive me home\". I caved and left the library to drive her home\n\nOn the ride home I commented that the weather was actually pretty nice (about ten degrees celcius with a bit of a drizzle). Its clear she took this as an insult or something because she responded with \"oh my god your so fucking lazy, you dont even have a job stop fucking complaining and just drive\". something about this particular comment set me off. So i pulled over and told her to get out. I didnt yell but when she protested I said \"get the fuck out before I flip my shit\".\n\nShe walked home and when she got home she was bawling her eyes out. Later that night my mom got mad at me, however I responded by saying that its literally a 5 minute drive and a 15 minute walk, its not like i made her run a marathon or anything.\n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\nPremature edit: Just to remove any confusion the walk home is 15 minutes in a suburban area.

Teenager stuff, I suppose. She should not have insulted you, even less so, while you were doing her a favour.\n\nBut she is still your little sister, my dude. Your sister! 10 degrees Celsius is fucking freezing where I am from AND it was raining! \n\nNow what I am wondering is, was it dark? Cause school can end pretty late sometimes. if it was, what you did was also dangerous for her.\n\nAnyways, I will say it again, that is your sister. You are her big brother. Act like it!

I'd have recommended instead that you finish the drive in frozen silence (heh), then tell her she's got to make her own arrangements for next time.", "ESH.  She sucks because she is old enough to be civil and kind, there was zero reason for her to speak to you the way she did in the car, she was straight up being abusive, i dont care that she is your younger sister, it was still verbal abuse.

I dont think her walking a few minutes in semi-cold weather endangers her as some have suggested \n\nI am a woman over 60 years old and many years ago i made my sons get out of the car and walk home when they were mouthing off and very disrespectful to me.  For the son who was 14 at the time, i followed along behind him until i thought maybe he had worked his angst out.  My other son was 16 at the time and we were about 10-15 from home and i didnt follow behind him.   Never had anymore issues with them being disrespectful after that.\n\nYour sister messed around and found out, hopefully she learned something.", "Esh - she's right, you commenting on the weather did seem passive aggressive, and given your full time student status it makes sense that she sees you as having a flexible enough schedule to help her and reasonable that she's less than thrilled when you don't just give her a yes or no when she's the one being respectful and asking well in advance instead of the last minute. \n\nYou're the only reason she had to ask and interrupt you more than once.\n\nBut she's having an attitude she has no reason to have when she's asking for a favour.\n\nSomething about your particular comment set her off, she returned the favour, and you scared her by angrily kicking her out of your car.", "YTA.  You could alter your schedule and go the library at another time.", "ESH\n\nShe was acting like an asshole.\n\nYou overreacted.
