Around an hour later she texted me again \"I really dont see why you cant give me a ride its not like you have any real obligations\" I responded with basiclaly the same thing saying, \"im not sure if I can\". Finally about a half hour before school let out she said \"OP its literally freezing out dont be an ass and drive me home\". I caved and left the library to drive her home\n\nOn the ride home I commented that the weather was actually pretty nice (about ten degrees celcius with a bit of a drizzle). Its clear she took this as an insult or something because she responded with \"oh my god your so fucking lazy, you dont even have a job stop fucking complaining and just drive\". something about this particular comment set me off. So i pulled over and told her to get out. I didnt yell but when she protested I said \"get the fuck out before I flip my shit\".\n\nShe walked home and when she got home she was bawling her eyes out.
