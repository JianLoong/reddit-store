I have been the sole financier for the past 4 years but not by choice. my wife loves to work, but due to covid and moving (again military), holding a job has been difficult for her.\n\nBack in 2019, my wife went on a huge spending spree (wanted to try photography) and that put us in an enormous amount of credit card debt. As a result, I went into a sever depression and I quit doing the finances. I could not handle the stress of it and said I'm done. I gave it all to my wife to figure out. So now my wife handles the finances, and luckily for her, she cleared all of the debt in about 5 months. yay, go wife.  Since then, she has been very strict with how we spend the past 4 years and all she wants to do is save, save, save. so its not like we don't have money, which that's her \"go to\" line, \"we don't have money\", the funds are just allocated to savings. Turns out, she's actually really good at managing money, sort of.\n\nBecause of her new found frugality, before I buy anything, I almost always feel like I'm not allowed and that I have to ask for permission, 9 times out of 10 she tells me no. There's been multiple times where I've bought something, and she tells me to return it. like a dvd or something. (yes I still like physical dvd's, and 4k, I'm not an animal, lol). and before I even consider buying something, I always stop and think, \"is this worth the argument?, and can I justify this?\"\n\nRecently, my wife landed a job which will put us over 200k total household income. I suggested to her that we set aside some \"fun money\" for each of us each paycheck to have a little financial freedom. She will get paid weekly, and I biweekly, 26 paychecks a year. I suggested 200 dollars a paycheck for me, and 100 for her. That's even, $5200 each. originally she liked the idea, but last night, we got into a big argument about where our money will be going, and now she doesn't like the idea of \"fun money\" and thinks all of our extra money should go towards savings...again, and that, \"we don't have money.\" \n\nI tried to explain the benefits of it (guilt free spending, healthy financial freedom, for me things I would buy include tools, games, hair cuts, movies, etc.) but she wasn't having it. The biggest thing for me in this, is that if I want to buy something then the decision lies with me, not her. She couldn't believe that I would want money for myself and didn't understand how extra money should go to anything but savings and tried to make me see how I don't need \"fun money.\"\n\nAt this point in the argument, I felt like I was being gaslighted and I expressed that to her and she blew up in my face and got extremely offended. She even questioned me on if I even knew what that meant...\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: so it seems gaslighting was the wrong thing to say. I can admit, that i probably didnt actually fully understand what it meant.

It's ridiculous that you feel you can't even buy a DVD with YOUR money that YOU earned. That's not right. She needs to understand a HEALTHY financial mindset and loosen the reigns imo.", "This isn't gaslighting, but you're still not TA in this situation. She sounds very controlling. Maybe there is anxiety surrounding finances, after you put them on her to fix the debt. It can be hard to get out of that hardcore saving mode and not feel guilty when you spend money. Who knows what she's going through. It's still not fair to dictate what you can and can't do with the money you earn, so long as your portion of the house's bills are paid (which it sounds like they are)\n\nNTA and you need to take control of your own money again.", "NTA. \n\nLook up financial abuse.

Is she building a nest egg for a potential child in the future?", "NTA.  I don't think she's actually gaslighting you but she most definitely wants total control of all the money.  It is not an unreasonable request to have discretionary money especially since that money would cover pretty much anything other than necessary household expenditures.  If I read this right, you can't even buy a DVD without her express permission and that is over the top.  You're her spouse and partner - not her child.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gaslighting but she must have a reason for saving so much. Maybe being in debt previously has made her more frugal.

Her desires to save are not wrong either.  You\u2019re certainly not an AH, and she\u2019s a mild one for how she discounts your attempt at a compromise.\n\nMy wife and I have always done what you proposed, and it\u2019s worked extremely well for us.  We call it \u201cprivate vs joint\u201d money.  There are no  arguments about whether she or I \u201dcan\u201d spend, or what we can spend it on \u2014 if I have private money saved and want to buy a thing, I do, and she gets no veto powers.  Vice-versa too, if course.\n\nThe problem with all of your money being joint, is that then what you do with it often becomes a zero-sum game.  There\u2019s none of that if you each have your own.", "NTA, you're proposing something very reasonable and it seems the current situation puts you in a place where you have to ask her permission to do anything when you technically have the funds to do those things. I don't think one person managing the other's money 100% really makes sense for most relationships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, she's right you don't know what gaslighting means.", "Seing as she's now working again and you're both financially contributing to the household.. \nWhy not sit down with your wife, have a proper look at your actual joint expenses, make sure you both pay into that as per your paychecks (50/50, 80/20 - whatever works for you), agree on a sum you'll both put into joint saving each month, and simply handle the rest of your individual paychecks, well, individually?\nIf you want to use 200 on whatever, go for it. If she wants to save all her 'personal' money, good for her. \nYou'll both be free to use or save as much as you want once your expenses and monthly joint savings are covered. Win-win.", "This isn't gaslighting but having fun money, separate spending money and the freedom to choose are never bad things.

Do you both have IRAs for your retirement? If you don\u2019t know, I\u2019d be concerned. Some information, even if it\u2019s not control is important.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said this isn't gaslighting, and I can see how it's almost financial abuse but coming from someone who also went from military breadwinner to poverty, I spent several years after being super frugal- to the point of going too far. This may be what your wife is going through. Especially if she wasn't like this prior to your time in debt. Being poor changes the way your brain thinks and analyzes costs (this is scientifically proven and even my therapist was the one who noticed it).\n\nIf you can, maybe couples counseling? Or some sort of mediation. Because your idea is the best one, but your wife is probably stuck in poverty mode and doesn't feel like she can relax and enjoy a little treat for herself or you.", "NTA \n\n1) It's your money you should be allowed to spend some of it  \n2) It's not gaslighting but whatever  \n3) Not sure if you have checked the finances your wife has been keeping but I'd check she ain't hiding some debt or a habit.", "I'm going to have to go with NTA. She does seem to be trying to convince you that you're the one who's bad with money, when she's the one that put you into debt. While I can see while some people would say it's not, it does certainly seem that way to me, whose mother is a notorious gaslighter. Make for \"fun money\" account, if she has a problem with it remind her that it is your money that you earned and therefore you are allowed to do what you want with it.", "NTA. You're entitled to your feelings. Feeling gaslit is a reasonable feeling when encountering someone telling you something bizarre, for which you are assuming a disproportionate amount of responsibility. Though I think her error falls short of that, she should be offended, and try to find a way to empathically meet your needs.", "This may have been said and you may or may not think it's a good idea, but I would get a separate bank account and have $200 deposited into it directly every 2 weeks.", "NTA. \n\nMy suggestion is to figure out why she want to save. Also you should clarify what having money means to each if you.  If you say that you have enough and she shmays that you don't then you don't have the same definition. \nYou will need to find a common sense definition of what that is, then set saving goals of if that.

You (both) work hard and she needs to loosen the reins a little.", "NTA What's the point of having money if you can't enjoy it? You guys might benefit from counseling.", "You know what want to know first\u2026 is how you dealt with the situation of your wife getting y\u2019all in credit card debt & what do you consider credit card debt if she was able to pay it off in 5 months. Could it be than now your wife doesn\u2019t have to depend on you for money so she\u2019s saving all she can for the future so she doesn\u2019t have to depend on you for it? Your wife gave up her work life and financial independence for you and your work, im sure that now that you\u2019re not in the military & she finally can have a job she\u2019s thinking about not being back in that situation. Either way, sit down with her and talk about it and put all the numbers down and what do you expect financially not only from yourself but her.", "Nta, not sure it's gaslighting but JFC you have to be able to get your hair cut when needed, especially if she's the one who got you into a bad spot in the first place idk why she's suddenly the final word on finances", "NAH - I agree with her that you might not know what gaslighting means, but more importantly you might need to set a budget for some marriage counseling. You got fed up with the finances and told her to deal with it, then you get upset with how she is dealing with it. On the other hand, saving is a very important goal, but what's the point of living if you can't enjoy the present? Plan for the future, but don't deprive yourself of joy today because you could get hit by a truck tomorrow.", "INFO: do you have access to the savings account?  Do you know that the debt is actually paid off?", "NTA\n\nIt's both of your money, so you should have equal say in how to spend it.  Obviously it is something you should talk through and come to some agreement on, but she shouldn't be treating you like a child on an allowance.", "NTA\n\nYou are in fact being gaslit. Your wife is lying by saying that you guys are broke and don\u2019t have money when it\u2019s definitely not true. It\u2019s not normal that you have to ask your wife permission to buy a damn DVD with your own money especially when she\u2019s the one who drove you into massive debt. You both need to set aside a budget for \u201cfun money\u201d on two separate accounts that you\u2019ll be able to access.", "Editing from gentle E-S-H to NTA - as others have pointed out, gaslighting is not the correct term here. But not being able to spend any money on yourself is not healthy. It seems like your wife may be afraid to fall back into debt and is going a little too far the other direction. IMO $400 fun money each isn\u2019t completely crazy for a $200k household, but maybe see if she\u2019d be willing to compromise on a smaller amount to test the waters. Saving is important, but having some fun money is a good thing as well.", "If we want to get pedantic (and don't we? This is Reddit, after all) that isn't actually \"gaslighting\". But that's really not the point.\n\nI suggest you go through with setting up a \"fun money\" account for yourself. Do not hide that you're doing this, be straight-forward with it. Do not debate it with her, you have every right to control your finances (and she can certainly do the same for herself). The only question is how much money to contribute - I'd suggest something on the lower end at first to make sure it works with the household budget.\n\nNTA", "So she is the one that put your household in severe credit card debt on her photography venture and until recently, you were the main provider. NTA at all. She doesn't get to dictate how you spend your money. Especially when she was the financially reckless one to begin with. My husband is the sole earner and I'm a SAHM. I don't ask permission to buy myself something like clothing or new shoes. I would only run it by him if it was a big purchase such as electronics.\n\nLook I'm for saving and not spending recklessly but you also need to enjoy life and find a balance. Your idea of setting aside some fun money once bills etc are paid is a good one. You need to talk to your wife and stand up for yourself.", "NTA, you can afford it and I am sure you know you do not have to spend all of it, so you can always put whatever is left over into savings.  This is a healthy compromise.  She has other issues she needs to deal with or you both need to deal with together.", "This isn\u2019t gaslighting. \n\nBut you need to get on the same page about this. You could tell her you want a joint account you both contribute to, but a portion of your money will be in its own account for spending.

It is important you and your wife come to an agreement about what percentage of income goes to savings, what goes to bills in a joint account, adn what goes to your personal accounts. You both work and earn money so idk why  you are acting like your wife has sole ownership. She doesn't, and if she is taking control of the accounts and locking you out of them or stashing away your money in a place you can't get it, that is called financial abuse (still not gaslighting).", "YTA \n\nPeople throw that term around way too easily and it doesn\u2019t apply here, you were having a disagreement she wasn\u2019t gaslighting you", "NTA.

Like big purchases without the go ahead from her?  $100 - $200 a paycheck is a lot in my opinion, start lower, like $50 a paycheck and go from there.\n\nAlso, take a look at the finances for yourself to get an idea if she's been spending money without your knowledge. It seems she's acting a bit suspicious of you and what you'll do with the new found freedom of some spending money, could be a guilt thing if on her part if she knows she's been spending irresponsibly.\n\nIf everything seems fine and no mysterious losses of money, there is no reason you both can't come to an agreement on some fun money, especially considering your incomes.  \n\n\n\\*Edit to mention\\* No, you weren't gaslit.

And/or she's decided to leave now that OP is 'around' all the time rather than deployed and is putting away as much cash as possible.\n\nRegardless op needs to take control of finances because there is zero reason to never spend anything beyond food with everything going to savings, if she's really doing that then she's developed a problem from being in debt and is now acting in a way that simply isn't healthy. But I suspect something worse is going on with finances.", "I don't think that makes a difference. Investing in a startup is just as irresponsible as spending on an impulse purchase. If you can't afford one you can't afford the other.", "I think you need to look over the account and debt info.

We had a small emergency fund, but the everyday expenses seemed to take up everything else. It felt like I had to ask permission to buy a $9 computer program.\n\nWhen we separated I started handling my own money, and even though all the expenses were still being paid, and savings were being filled, I suddenly was flush with extra spending money. I could purchase what I wanted, and still pay for everything that needed paying for.\n\nI still have no idea how that works out.", "There are a few types of abuse in relationships....this is financial abuse.

I think there is more to this story.", "NTA even if you misused a term, jeez. I wish Imwas as financially obsessive as your wife, but she really does need to make allowance for a bit of financial freedom - for both of you. Otherwise there\u2019s going to be a lot of resentment brewing and it will boil over somehow.", "NTA Although she isn't gaslighting you, she's being an asshole. You're making 6 figures between the 2 of you, you should be able to buy a DVD or get a haircut without begging your spouse for permission. \n\nMaybe the both of you should talk to a financial counselor. They will almost certainly agree that having some fun money is perfectly fine in this situation.", "I came here to say exactly that.\nI was in a financially abusive marriage and I didn\u2019t realize it for a long time. My (ex) husband did extremely similar things to what OP\u2019s wife is doing to him.\nIt\u2019s miserable to live with.", "Also, playing the devil\u2019s advocate, it might also be that their previous situation of being in debt left a huge impression on her, and she\u2019s somewhat afraid to go back to that situation and is handling it in an unhealthy way\u2026 I am assuming if their debt put OP in a depression, their situation must have been pretty hairy, and the wife was the one who had to handle everything alone (also yes even if she was the reason they went into debt, it must have been hard for her too).\n\nCheering for you OP and I hope you guys can resolve this soon!", "My first thoughts.  Easy to find credit rating", " I'm cynical enough to wonder if she's saving for their future or just hers.", "Let me give you some advice. In a relationship you should have 4 accounts. 1 account for household bills both parties contribute to 1 account for savings and each party should have their own account for the left over money from their check (or split if you guys are a on breadwinner home) \n\nYou should not have to ask your wife before buying a $5 dvd. It\u2019s really not that deep. You both should sit down and look at finances to see what\u2019s going on there and what you have in savings. People usually use saving if they want a new car or an emergency fund but also just to go on vacation. I would recommend having a minimum amount in your savings as an emergency fund but other than that use it to do something or invest it when the stock market isn\u2019t as bad\u2026\n\nAlso getting out of an \u201cenormous\u201d amount of credit card debt in 5 months is impressive and almost too good to be true but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Take back control of your finances, look at some recent statements, things like that.

The husband at the time wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t (depends on who\u2019d you ask, my opinion he was a lazy SOB who was addicted to drugs there entire marriage) yet his wife worked full time as a waitress while pregnant (this was even after the doctor put her on bed rest) with all 3 of her pregnancies. He was also very controlling of her spending and would question every single dollar that she spent. I can remember her collecting change to have on hand to be able to occasionally get something off the dollar menu for her and her kids (if I was with I would pay for it instead). Thankfully she\u2019s in the process of divorcing him although he\u2019s dragging his feet on it badly and is upset that he has to pay child support.", "NTA gaslighting isn't the correct term but what's the point in earning money if your never allowed to enjoy yourself even eith small purchases specially since she was the one who caused the debt previously your just working to pay bills and have no enjoyment thats miserable", "My ex had $400 a week. He \"allowed\" me $100 a month, but my meds, medical co-pays, and such had to come out of that money because he wouldn't include it in the normal monthly spending. So I often had to miss appointments, or skip meds.", "By saying Y T A you're completely overlooking the fact that he's being abused simply because he used the wrong word to describe his abuse, which is just wrong.

You can set up an account in your name only and have a direct deposit of a certain amount go into that account and she can do what she wants with what\u2019s left over if that is what YA\u2019LL decide. But if you have the money and you aren\u2019t in debt and it isn\u2019t a huge purchase, then you have every right to spend your money.\n\nThe thing that alarms me is the fact that you threw in hair cuts to your fun money budget. Hair cuts aren\u2019t fun money budget. I would list those under household essentials. I think you need to get a little more involved and put your foot down a little more firmly. I understand that she wants to save money, but at this point in time she is essentially financially bullying you. The only thing that is off is that is your money she is bullying you with and not you billing her with your money.

Seriously.", "NTA You deserve some money just for you.   \n\n\nThat said, I've read most of the follow up comments and saw that you're in the process of buying a house and your wife hasn't yet started her new job. I think it's quite possible that your wife is feeling anxiety about this new purchase. Her desire to keep a tight hold on the finances is probably because of the unknown of how much this is all going to cost. Buying a house and moving is expensive. I'd guess she is thinking she wants to use her new income to build up the savings again after the new home purchase. I can relate to that.   \n\n\nI control the finances in our house. Recently we bought a new house and money has been flying out the door. So my husband and I sat down and worked out a budget to get it under control. The key is that we did it together. Maybe this is what you and your wife should do, so you both know where all the money is going. I do fully support having a line item in there for you to have your own \"mad money.\" No one likes having to ask their partner every time they want to spent $20. She can still do the finances if that's what you work out, but you both should be on board with how much is going where.", "NTA - I think I remember seeing a Steve Harvey video where he outlines how every couple should have 4 accounts.

If you were to both die tomorrow, where would that saving have got you? \n\nI'm all for pooled resources, but if you're not careful, your marriage is set to implode! A long time ago, I was told that our greatest difficulties in marriage would come from money. Not whether there was too much or too little, but our attitudes to it.

Wife just got a job that is also six figures. $400 a month for discretionary spending is not laughably large.
