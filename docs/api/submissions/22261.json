We also talk about the dog and the baby poops a lot. We\u2019re a very shitty family (pun intended)", "Is swamp ass not a common phrase? Everyone I know refers to it that way \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude02", "My son and I both complain about swamp ass; we've decided it must be genetic. By the way if you get chafed from it, Anti-Monkeybutt Cream rocks.", "Swamp ass shortened to swass, and the dreadful cactass", "Me and my bf give each other poo updates every day. But it stops at \"small poo\" \"big poo\" \"spicy poo\"", "Wtf this literally happened with my ex too. The first time or two, it was funny. And then it became a way too common occurrence and just became gross.", "We have a baby, the door never closes & we're never alone!", "Okay I have to know- is it really that normal for couples to use the bathroom in front of each other?  I've been in a couple LTRs (one was 6 yrs) and we never kept the door open", "I have never understood why people don't close the bathroom door. Why? I'll talk about BM's all day long but I don't really need to see you have one...", "There is a difference between accepting bowel movements as an act of nature and taking pleasure in talking about said bowel movements. I have no attachment to my bowel movements and I do not find fart jokes funny. You randomly expressing \"I took a fat shit\" using those exact words would not be something that I would take interest in. If you need to tell me that your poop has been different lately and you may need to see a doctor that's important information. Ok. Telling me you really stank up the bathroom is not the same at all. I understand that others find that kind of vulgarity humorous but you're not abnormal if you don't and prefer to not listen to it. It's not about having a strong relationship it's about personal preferences and styles of humor.", "isn\u2019t swamp ass just from sweating? you can\u2019t help sweating. there\u2019s not an asshole antiperspirant last time I checked.", "Yeah, and if someone explicitly expresses this makes them uncomfortable, you should stop", "XD", "I have ibs. I've been known to use the phrase \"peeing out my butt\" when talking to my husband about how I feel.", "I had to have a colonoscopy recently, and the diet I was allowed was yellow jelly, sports drinks, water and barley sugar. So I ate lots of yellow jelly because I was starving and chugged two blue Powerades. My shits that night were fluro green liquid with big chunks of straight up green blobby jelly. It was so impressive I had to take a picture and show my husband. He was disgustingly impressed at how well the jelly held up, and how the two colours created green. I guess he\u2019s used to me and my ibs saga \ud83d\ude06", "Poopmaggedon.", "If I have a massive upset it sometimes looks like a cow pie and I tell my bf that all the time.", "Dude!!!!! I love it, poocano!!! I can bloody see it. The viscosity,  the exact colour, the feel of it destroying porcelain,  the smell peeling paint. Ive been there, severe dairy issue's. \nThank you for teaching me that term \nPOOCANO!!!", "Y\u2019all need to listen to the chorus of No Roots and sing:\n\nI\u2019ve got some POOPS in my butthole \nAn\u2019 they tryin\u2019 to come out\nI\u2019ve got them POOOOooooOOOOooooOooops\nI\u2019ve got them POOOooooOoooOOOooops", "That\u2019s hysterical!

We\u2019re incredibly comfy with each other!", "I think it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just about comfort level. My husband and I will not poop in front of each other, (like door open I mean, we\u2019ll go when we\u2019re both home but give each other the space and privacy the other wants) but I\u2019m fine peeing with the door open or if he wants to come in while I\u2019m peeing or if one of us has to pee while the other showers, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. \n\nI mean we see each other naked all the time. Sex is gross, you\u2019re swapping bodily fluids. No shame in peeing. But it\u2019s the consent that matters! If both parties are fine with it, it\u2019s fine. But if one person is uncomfortable, the other shouldn\u2019t force the issue on them.", "The only time the bathroom door is closed in our house is when someone is pooping and even then, sometimes it isn't shut all the way because the cats go crazy. 12 years, 2 cats, no kids.", "Definitely preference. My partner always has the door open and definitely used to try to come in and talk to me. I am very private in the washroom (like I don't even like brushing my teeth at the same time as someone else, I need my space!) and I'll always shut the door . I always hated in highschool when my girlfriends would all have to go to the bathroom together. Let me pee in peace!", "Living in a house with one bathroom, eventually one you needs to go while the other is taking a shower.", "Kids can make a huge difference, I never close the bathroom door anymore, someone is just gonna have a meltdown outside of it if its locked, or open it if its not.", "For me it\u2019s absolutely bizarre, if I\u2019m going to the bathroom, I don\u2019t want company.", "Yes, especially if you have a cat or dog....they bang that door open....I just gave up", "I was married to my first love then I was with a man for 10 years and had children and didn\u2019t poo in front of either of them. Been with my current husband 5 years and honestly we\u2019ve played top trumps while I\u2019ve pooped many times. I\u2019m celiac and sometimes gluten gets in so I need a hot water bottle, a toilet and some company.", "For my husband and I, for peeing, we don't mind the door open. Pooping, closed. Occasionally I'll have to open the door to hand him something or whatever but I don't look. I try not to breathe.", "i think \u201ctaking pleasure\u201d is a stretch lmaooo. It\u2019s not like my significant other or I get off talking about poop. we just joke around about everything and saying \u201cI just took the biggest shit\u201d every once in a while isn\u2019t gross to me and I don\u2019t see my significant other any different. I also work in healthcare so I\u2019m definitely desensitized to gross stuff so maybe that\u2019s a factor. I don\u2019t talk about my bowel movements w everyone so my comfort level with my significant other is DEFINITELY a factor. btw I never said \u201coh if u don\u2019t talk abt poop w ur significant other you guys are not close\u201d. everyone\u2019s different like you said but I do think maturity plays a factor.", "It is but also moisture left unchecked from an unclean ass. When someone has a sweaty ass, they say they have a sweaty ass. When they say swamp ass, it means their ass smells from unattended moisture and itch has set in from leaving it over periods of time.\n\nAlso, you can easily just swipe with witch hazel or some baby powder when dealing with a sweaty ass.

I've toned it down a wee bit....do not do that while he us eating or out and about.  I laugh about toilet humor and have been known to be absolutely graphic...I can make rustic gross talking men puke with my descriptions.   It's a gift. \n\nop needs to decide if he can live with that. In the long.....run, it may not work out.  Especially if she has chronic digestive issues.  I make fun of mine and am open about it so when I have to run off suddenly, no one gets hurt feelings or if I have miss out on a get together while I am stuck in the loo.   Think this over carefully.
