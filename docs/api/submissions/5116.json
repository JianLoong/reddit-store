Perhaps your youngest needs assistance, but the others are in their 20s! Young adults routinely go backpacking alone across multiple countries where they don't speak the language, but you're afraid of your children leaving the hotel for a few hours?

Not only are you pushing your responsibility on one of your children, you are wondering why your son snapped at you after being on a trip even you described as exhausting. If I see anyone \"ruining\" this trip for your family, it's you. You keep saying how instrumental B is, but then throw a tantrum over him taking his mind off over dinner? Maybe he is irritating because you keep pushing responsibilities on him while he is still recovering from the flu, while you are \"resting when possible\", just after he had to get his older brother, because you wouldn't.

You're daughter is right. 2 of you are sick. 1 of you likely doesn't travel well due to anxiety & depression.  The only healthy one is barely an adult & is in charge of all of you.

The last line is a kicker to me, that your eldest son agrees B\u2019s being annoying? Don\u2019t play your kids off against each other. \n\nAnd when you said that B\u2019s behaviour was a \u2018low light\u2019 it would be impossible not to take that as a personal attack. \n\nSet some reasonable rules ahead of time, perhaps about staying off of phones during meals that everyone agrees to - and be understanding if someone needs some down time from family after a stressful situation.", "YTA.

Did B want to come on this trip or was he repoed into it?", "YTA. Being disabled doesn't mean you get to order everyone around and lay all the responsibilities on your 20yo child. this is a trip YOU wanted to take, and it's not fair to lay all the responsibilities on one person to the point they can't even enjoy it. it's extremely stressful", "Not gonna say YTA but I'm definitely in B's side here too. Sounds like he's the only one making sure this trip doesn't end disastrously and doing a lot of mental and physical labor on vacation.

He just literally looked for YOUR ADULT SON for you, he\u2019s been solely responsible for keeping the trip together and you snap just because of a phone? Wow you must be fun on vacations. Congratulations on the last vacation your middle son will ever join you on.", "YTA..\n\n1. You have made B the defacto parent in this situation. Not once have I seen you delegate any of the responsibilities that you have foisted onto B to the other kids. Why aren't you stepping up and helping with this.\n2. Two of your kids are sick and you are having health issues. While family trips are great, taking this trip was probably a mistake given two of the three kids are down with something and you are down for most of the trip yourself.\n3. You're forcing a family bonding experience and not allowing the kids to have their space. I would imagine B is pretty fucking done right now and wants to escape. After all, this has \"been strenuous on all of our mental health.\" Vacations are suppose to be about decompression and self care. none of this is evident.\n4. B snapped at you because you took a powder on responsibility for the trip.\n\nThis could have been an awesome family trip. But you mismanaged this. You should Expect to be at the minimum Low Contact with B when you guys get back home. Your Daughter is right. You and A are on vacation and are expecting B to work it.", "YTA.

Shame on you.", "YTA - if you can\u2019t adequately take care of your kids on a trip the solution isn\u2019t to dump all the responsibility on one, it\u2019s to cancel the rest and go home early. This isn\u2019t fair.", "YTA. Apparently you planned a demanding trip while you're physically not capable of managing said trip. And all of the responsibility falls on B. He sounds more like a nurse or a butler than a son. And son A is the one who broke the rules, forcing son B to go look for him for hours, AND son B was kind enough to bring back some food, and yet you're mad at him and not A? What the hell? It sounds like this trip has been stressful and not really fun at all for B, so the least you can do is let him decompress on his phone for a bit.", "YTA.\n\nB has been carrying the family for this entire trip. Cut him some slack and let him take a break. As much as I believe in valuing family time over anything else, you targeting B for using his phone is a bad move, since A ran off on his own to the inconvenience of everyone else.\n\nThere's no reason you can't have family time and alone time in a trip. When you force family time, it breeds resentment.", "YTA 100%, you cannot expect a 20 year old to spend all his time doing everything for, it would seem, not just his siblings but also you as well. Your middle child went out (you claim for literal hours) to go get his OLDER sibling and from your own story doesn't complain but just goes on his phone? A very normal thing for a young adult to do? and your instant reaction is to cuss at him... You don't get how that makes you TA?\n\nTo top it off you bring it up again later and after the family has, presumably, moved on and expected what as a reaction? what an ill thought-out trip", "YTA\n\nSo basically B is providing 99% of the effectiveness for this trip and of he decided to leave the 3 of you wouldn't be able to handle it without him, but you don't think he deserves any kind of respite from carrying you all on his metaphorical back?\n\nYou sound ungrateful and dangerously close to biting the hand thats feeding you.", "YTA. First of all, B is an adult. He is carrying the whole responsibility for this trip and, therefore, it is completely understandable that after searching for his  brother for hours, he needs some rest (Be it being on his phone for hours or whatever it is he wants to do).\n\nJust let him be, he also needs to rest and just accept the fact that being on his phone is how he gets some. PD: him being on his phone doesn't mean he doesn't care o he's not 'there' on the family trip.", "YTA\n\nI'm 55M with 5 kids, so it's not just the young people here giving you the YTA answer.\n\nYour son B was the whole reason the trip wasn't a chaotic (and possibly tragic) mess.  Apart from allowing him to use his phone, I would've given him something extra for all the help.\n\nYou need to see the whole picture and appreciate what your kids do for you.  A and B are adults and you have to get used to not having as much control over them as you had in the past.  If you don't realize that, you may be in for some lonely times in your older years.", "YTA - all the previous comments sums up so well. It\u2019s not a holiday but a stressful errand for B, and instead thanking him you snap at him without no real reason. Being on the phone is not a huge deal.", "YTA, and YOU\u2019RE the one dragging down the trip for the whole family, not your son\u2026unbelievable!", "YTA for asking your son to put his phone down, but also for calling this a vacation.

We did do stuff as a family, not as much as she\u2019d have maybe liked, but after only one blowup and a follow up talk she understood we wanted different things.

B is STILL EXPERIENCING STRESS, but he won't show it.\n\nB spent the whole day doing responsible stuff: finding his brother, fetching food, looking after things.

What he said was, \"I've spent enough time with you all already, honestly.\" That was rude, but I want you to look at what he MEANT there. What he was trying to say was, \"I don't have enough social energy right now.\" He was stressed and he needed some down time - some time to STOP being social and just retreat inward.

Texting with friends is probably a break from all you are requiring of him. Shouldn't it be his vacation too. Knowing you had all these problems,  you planned for B to take on too much responsibility. He probably resents this and finally exploded.", "So this vacation goal was to make everyone feel miserable right? Because that looks like that was the goal. YTA. Let your son be.", "YTA For treating your adult son like a personal assistant", "YTA, what the hell are you stressed about? You make B handle all the details that cause stress.", "YTA - this trip is obviously a nightmare for your kids, with issues that aren\u2019t your fault like illnesses on top of you setting restrictive rules.  It also sounds like you\u2019re heaping responsibility for most of the hassles of travel on B, including a teenager and an adult with mental health issues that are definitely being triggered.  And none of your kids speak the local language well!  This could be s comedy sketch it sounds so bad.  And then you single B out to complain about his behavior, which is a passive-aggressive asshole move to begin with, but even more so when his behavior is just trying to mentally escape this debacle.  \nApologize to B, step up as both the native speaker and the parent, stop badmouthing one of your kids to the others, and next time let someone else plan the trip - if your kids will even agree to a next time.  If I were in their shoes, hell would freeze first.\n\nEdited: realized I misunderstood who was responsible for what.", "It sounds like your middle child has done nothing but parent his siblings and YOU this trip. I\u2019m not surprised that, after several hours of looking for his lost sibling *and* bringing you food, that he wanted to decompress on his phone. And rather than giving the kid who is recovering from the flu a break, you yelled at him and again demanded more of him.\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nYTA", "NAH. when I was 15 it was a discman, and my parents would yell at me and insisted I was missing out on the experiences of the trip. In retrospect I see their point, at the time I was furious", "YTA. Not totally.  Touring trips are especially hard on everyone.  The last two trips I took with my family, 2 adults and 2 older teens were amazing.  What made them amazing was that I had organized a private tour guide at our major stops.  The guide met us in our hotel lobby, chatted briefly about the plan for the day\u2026and off we went.  The guides know everything from where to grab a quick drink, where to hit the restrooms, shortcuts thru town.  It\u2019s just money we\u2019ll spent and make the touring days much more relaxing and enjoyable for all.", "YTA you made your son wait on all of you and then couldn\u2019t even let him have a few moments to himself. Do you not get you and the sick ward weren\u2019t a vacation for him? \n\nYTA big time", "I\u2018ll go NTA on asking your son to put his phone away. Having it out while having dinner is rude. \n\nBUT, as others have pointed out, he also needs time to himself. Your oldest son is 22, he can use his phone to figure out how to do stuff and doesn\u2018t need a babysitter. Your daughter needs someone to watch out for her, but that\u2018s your job. \n\nAs young adults, going on trips with parents can be fun, but that doesn\u2018t mean sticking together 24/7.", "Sounds like the worst vacation ever.  I would definitely pass on that one.  The children are not children, either, they are adults.  Why is he treating them as if they are children?  Putting one of them \"in charge\" of the others?  This is weird.", "I didn't go on this vacation, and I am already exhausted by it. YTA", "Sounds like it's likely that he comes from a culture where the oldest male is controlling and it's accepted. Problem is, the kids have been raised in a culture where they understand they have agency. So I guess dad's either going to have to adapt or probably end up losing the relationship with at least one of his kids.", "It sounds like a status symbol trip, something you do to show off. It's not for anyone's enjoyment, it's only to make other people feel less.", "He didn\u2019t make his son act as caregiver.\n\n He \u201centrusted\u201d him to be the caretaker. It\u2019s a great privilege!\n\nI\u2019m sure we can relate to the intense desire to be given the honor of babysitting our siblings in a foreign country while we are recovering from the flu.  /s"]}
