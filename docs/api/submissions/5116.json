Perhaps your youngest needs assistance, but the others are in their 20s! Young adults routinely go backpacking alone across multiple countries where they don't speak the language, but you're afraid of your children leaving the hotel for a few hours?

Not only are you pushing your responsibility on one of your children, you are wondering why your son snapped at you after being on a trip even you described as exhausting. If I see anyone \"ruining\" this trip for your family, it's you. You keep saying how instrumental B is, but then throw a tantrum over him taking his mind off over dinner? Maybe he is irritating because you keep pushing responsibilities on him while he is still recovering from the flu, while you are \"resting when possible\", just after he had to get his older brother, because you wouldn't.

You're daughter is right. 2 of you are sick. 1 of you likely doesn't travel well due to anxiety & depression.  The only healthy one is barely an adult & is in charge of all of you.

Did B want to come on this trip or was he repoed into it?", "YTA. Being disabled doesn't mean you get to order everyone around and lay all the responsibilities on your 20yo child. this is a trip YOU wanted to take, and it's not fair to lay all the responsibilities on one person to the point they can't even enjoy it. it's extremely stressful", "Not gonna say YTA but I'm definitely in B's side here too. Sounds like he's the only one making sure this trip doesn't end disastrously and doing a lot of mental and physical labor on vacation.

He just literally looked for YOUR ADULT SON for you, he\u2019s been solely responsible for keeping the trip together and you snap just because of a phone? Wow you must be fun on vacations. Congratulations on the last vacation your middle son will ever join you on.", "YTA..\n\n1. You have made B the defacto parent in this situation. Not once have I seen you delegate any of the responsibilities that you have foisted onto B to the other kids. Why aren't you stepping up and helping with this.\n2. Two of your kids are sick and you are having health issues. While family trips are great, taking this trip was probably a mistake given two of the three kids are down with something and you are down for most of the trip yourself.\n3. You're forcing a family bonding experience and not allowing the kids to have their space. I would imagine B is pretty fucking done right now and wants to escape. After all, this has \"been strenuous on all of our mental health.\" Vacations are suppose to be about decompression and self care. none of this is evident.\n4. B snapped at you because you took a powder on responsibility for the trip.\n\nThis could have been an awesome family trip. But you mismanaged this. You should Expect to be at the minimum Low Contact with B when you guys get back home. Your Daughter is right. You and A are on vacation and are expecting B to work it.", "YTA.

He sounds more like a nurse or a butler than a son. And son A is the one who broke the rules, forcing son B to go look for him for hours, AND son B was kind enough to bring back some food, and yet you're mad at him and not A? What the hell? It sounds like this trip has been stressful and not really fun at all for B, so the least you can do is let him decompress on his phone for a bit.", "YTA.\n\nB has been carrying the family for this entire trip. Cut him some slack and let him take a break. As much as I believe in valuing family time over anything else, you targeting B for using his phone is a bad move, since A ran off on his own to the inconvenience of everyone else.\n\nThere's no reason you can't have family time and alone time in a trip. When you force family time, it breeds resentment.", "YTA 100%, you cannot expect a 20 year old to spend all his time doing everything for, it would seem, not just his siblings but also you as well. Your middle child went out (you claim for literal hours) to go get his OLDER sibling and from your own story doesn't complain but just goes on his phone? A very normal thing for a young adult to do? and your instant reaction is to cuss at him... You don't get how that makes you TA?\n\nTo top it off you bring it up again later and after the family has, presumably, moved on and expected what as a reaction? what an ill thought-out trip", "YTA\n\nSo basically B is providing 99% of the effectiveness for this trip and of he decided to leave the 3 of you wouldn't be able to handle it without him, but you don't think he deserves any kind of respite from carrying you all on his metaphorical back?\n\nYou sound ungrateful and dangerously close to biting the hand thats feeding you.", "YTA. First of all, B is an adult. He is carrying the whole responsibility for this trip and, therefore, it is completely understandable that after searching for his  brother for hours, he needs some rest (Be it being on his phone for hours or whatever it is he wants to do).\n\nJust let him be, he also needs to rest and just accept the fact that being on his phone is how he gets some. PD: him being on his phone doesn't mean he doesn't care o he's not 'there' on the family trip.", "YTA\n\nI'm 55M with 5 kids, so it's not just the young people here giving you the YTA answer.\n\nYour son B was the whole reason the trip wasn't a chaotic (and possibly tragic) mess.  Apart from allowing him to use his phone, I would've given him something extra for all the help.\n\nYou need to see the whole picture and appreciate what your kids do for you.  A and B are adults and you have to get used to not having as much control over them as you had in the past.  If you don't realize that, you may be in for some lonely times in your older years.", "YTA - all the previous comments sums up so well. It\u2019s not a holiday but a stressful errand for B, and instead thanking him you snap at him without no real reason.

We did do stuff as a family, not as much as she\u2019d have maybe liked, but after only one blowup and a follow up talk she understood we wanted different things. Plan some things together, but part of the joy I get from traveling is \u201cgetting lost\u201d somewhere new by myself. Let your son who wants to do that do it.", "YTA - time to reconfigure this trip to something you can actually participate in as the main adult!", "Regarding the specific situation with the phone, I think it would be ok to ask politely if B could put his phone away while they were eating. However, OP immediately acted irritated.", "Why did op book such an ott holiday knowing their health problems is my Q I hope B learns from this and tells op to stuff their next vacation", "And OP doesn't even seem to enjoy it! I'm a pain chronic and the way I describe my pain is that it is durable but it's like being at a family birthday party with angry old women yapping constantly. It's durable for a while and then you just want to fucking EXPLODE and make those yappers SHUT UP! Honestly, I think B knows EXACTLY what I mean!\n\nOP, you need to get a serious understanding of your limitations - as well as the limitations of your family. B sounds like a goddamned superhero to me - and while doing this constantly has to listen to his dad berating him! You're parentifying a young man who already has a lot on his plate and on top of that you expect him to be grateful for being dragged on this hell tour? You might be the one spending the money but the rest of the family is DEF paying a price as well! And I'd personally prefer to \"just\" have to spend money!\n\nYTA - time to reconfigure this trip to something you can actually participate in as the main adult! As is, it won't be a fond memory for anyone and that is solely on you!", "> And son A is the one who broke the rules, forcing son B to go look for him for hours, AND son B was kind enough to bring back some food, and yet you're mad at him and not A? \n\nThis right here is the key phrase.   Wish I could upvote this into infinity.\n\nOP - get off B's ass.  Thank him for watching out for all of you.  YTA", "This!  This was my main thing. Like hello!  Your adult children have the flu and are out and about. Spreading It to other people. And you\u2019re made about a phone!!?", "why is it bad doing umrah whilst sick? people on the brink of death have performed umrah. i understand OPs choice to come now, its not very easy to arrange esp when you're sick. so being able to go there is a once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\n the main issue here is a middle eastern man who lived in the west and raised his kids to be western and now all of a sudden expects them to act eastern. that certainly wont happen, he's the asshole for expecting a different output to the input he gave in.", "B has spent all of his time parenting and taking care of everything, he deserves a break on his phone. He spent HOURS looking for A, which should have been the parents job, and if the parent can\u2019t parent the trip should have been postponed. B has been doing everything, OP is definitely the AH and an entitled one at that. Op, YTA, without doubt. What an awful vacation.", "B is literally stuck with his siblings all day parenting them and chaperoning them around\n\nGuy just wanted a freaking break", "then you need to be the parent, instead of putting your other kid in charge of everything", "If your son has such severe mental health issues, maybe a trip to a country such as this was not your best move. Maybe you should have tried a \"safer\" or \"easier\" country/place for him first. Like a tiny shire in New Zealand. Island nation so he can't get that lost and if you found a small town, he couldn't get lost if he tried. \n\nOr, you let him sink or swim because he is an adult and unless you have the crazy idea of making him buddy system the rest of his life, he needs to learn", "Damn sorry you got downvoted to hell man. I can understand what you are oming from though. hopefully you guys can get it all figured it out. Soft Yta.", "This and the missing son is the eldest and is 22!!! Not a teenager or a kid.", "Sounds like he has been doing that while you're off \"resting\".  You sound like an entitled child throwing a tantrum.  Other poster was correct, you sound like a tyrant.", "He is he's literally parenting your kids for you 90%of his vacation", "Well you can lie in bed all day at home, don\u2019t go on a trip and be a wet blanket and then blame your kids", "You can lie in bed all day at home, what's your fucking excuse?", "People need breaks.  They need breaks from family.  You have come up with an extremely stressful trip, and you are not in good health.  B is the parent in all of this, but as the parent he needs a break.\n\nThe trip sounds a bit chaotic.  In the future, one thing to see a day, and the rest of the time it's good to rest.", "Your wants don't Trump everyone else's", "Made* his middle son be the caretaker by my read. Let the man destress by being on this phone, damn OP.", "What was so wrong about him wanting to be on his phone for one evening?", "Right? On top of OP being a complete AH by asking about \"low points\" (seriously, who frickin' does that?) just so he could be an AH and say the one he put in charge of everything! has a bad attitude.", "Then why would you plan this trip to begin with?? You set everyone up for failure and now you\u2019re blaming B. Super selfish of you.", "Then you should have stayed home", "I have physical limitations, pain, and sometimes require a wheelchair. I plan my travel accordingly and travel and vacations with my partner and teenage son are absolutely delightful. I find things we all can do, and some things they can do on their own while I hang out in the room, take a long bath, read and eat snacks.\n\nYou did not plan for your disability, which is your responsibility. You made plans as if you did not have disabilities, and made a burden of yourself on your children, especially B. And then you berate him for needing chill time after dealing with the mess you made.\n\nYou don't think he needs a little time to recharge his social batteries after having to manage this vacation for you? \n\nYTA", "How is it a break for B if you're in bed all the time and he is responsible for his siblings? That doesn't seem like a vacation for him.\n\nI understand having health issues but if yours are so bad you can't be responsible for your children and have to delegate all responsibility to your middle child then you shouldn't have planned this kind of vacation.\n\nYTA", "So you made B come at a time that was inconvenient, you are not in good health, and assumed that everyone magically knew what your expectations were?", ">we\u2019re doing it in order to bond and get a break\n\nit doesn't sound like B is getting a break considering you have him babysitting everybody else due to your control issues.", "So why didn't you? As it sounds like he's done everything for you this holiday and got no thanks or down time for himself", "How was that bond cemented while you were in bed?", "Sounds like this is going to be his last holiday he wishes to go with you on", "YTA- you ruined HIS vacation-by insisting on not postponing it in spite of his very valid reasons; by placing all of the responsibilities of an international trip for four people, in places he doesn\u2019t speak the language, on his shoulders; by not showing any understanding or gratitude to your son for stepping up in that situation; by blaming him for your self-inflicted stress. This entire trip was for you, and he has gone above and beyond to make it work. He is 100% entitled to some downtime, especially as this has not, in any way, been a vacation for him. He\u2019s been a servant the entire time.", "Valid points. It just sounds like the dad wanted to do this, didn\u2019t care about whether the family was on bored or sick and then got mad when they didn\u2019t step up as he wished.", "Well, the two with the flu shouldn't be doing Umrah or anything else, since they are spreading disease. And the old man shouldn't be on a \"pilgrimage\" that is essentially him spending all of his time in bed, while foisting responsibility on one of his sick children.", "How does someone with anxiety even leaves alone in unfamiliar place and doesn't take phone with themselves?? Can't imagine doing that", "Honestly, I have severe back pain (from a break that didn't heal properly). He still sounds lazy to not be the one looking for his lost child and then to be upset his child he has put in charge of this entire disaster of a trip wanted to relax on his phone after all this stress and he yelled at him.", "Nope he is a very controlling person. He will probably never have a vacation with son again.", "Every comment makes it clearer, the lack of self awareness is breathtaking. \n\nOP is also going to be the missing missing reasons posterchild after B goes NC. \n\nOP YTA YTA YTA", "YTA - this trip sounds like the trip from HELL! Your kid ending up having to parent all of you on this \u201cvacation\u201d & you got upset when he spent time on his phone? This is definitely the last time they\u2019ll go on a trip with you", "So why did you choose to vacation in a place where you could not actively help take care of your minor child and feel unsafe? Make your child  parent your other children and take care of everything while you lay in bed? Sorry you don\u2019t feel well, but you make up a lot of excuses for your behavior. YTA", "YTA, big time. You get sick, saddle your 20yo to be coordinator/lead, send him out to find your other son, they come back with food for YOU and then when the guy who doesn't speak arabic wants to unwind - since he cant watch tv, can't read anything there...he opts for his phone and you can't deal. You're a world class huge AH.", "Book a holiday your family could manage without making B the permanent carer of his siblings? Go somewhere A could manage and feel more comfortable so that he wouldn't require baby sitting?", "If your health won\u2019t permit you to go find your own child why are you even on this trip?", "Admit that you paid for this vacation and therefore you want to dictate what everyone does and how they do it.\n\nI am sensing this is cultural and you are used to controlling your family. Be prepared for them not having much to do with you once they move out of your control.", "If your health is so bad you can't leave your hotel room, why aren't you ending your vacation and going home?", "Your option was to THANK YOUR SON B FOR RESCUING YOUR IRRESPONSIBLE SON A AND BRINGING BACK FOOD FOR ALL OF YOU then sit down and shut your mouth.  \n\nYour gratitude to B should be overwhelming any minor irritation you have about phones at the table.", "A didn't have phone How did you know he was looking at?", "You could have realized that you weren\u2019t up to being a parent on this trip, and that you could have stayed home.", "A is an adult. He can make his way back.\n\nYou sent your still-sick kid out for hours to look for him and he couldn\u2019t take a moment on his phone? He\u2019s already fulfilling all the parental duties because you chose a difficult trip while unwell. YTA", "I mean to be honest it sounds more like the 20male is the kid, who has to do everything for op and siblings. And that the siblings (both old enough) are used to it not taking care of themselves...", "Son deserves a vacation to recover/destress from traveling with OP. Few things sound as exhausting as this man. Unbelievable is right!", "And his younger son is sick with the flu as well. Poor kid.", "You said it perfectly", "Get a guide, book a tour, hire a driver, anything rather than book a trip where you will not be able to do much and make one child in charge of everything.", "This he's been babysitting his siblings, being in charge of their safety, has to go out and find his older sibling and brought food back where is his thanks? Nope, just get off your d*m phone like he's a naughty child that hasn't been parenting his siblings this whole vacation", "OP isn't sick. He has back pain.", "And B doesn\u2019t speak the language well and is recovering from illness! But dad wants bonding NOW so get that phone away. Yikes."]}
