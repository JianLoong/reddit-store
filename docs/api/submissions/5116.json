Today, A went out on his own and left his phone in the hotel room and got lost- B went out and was gone for a few hours to find him. My daughter and I were of course very tense as A has a bad sense of direction and God knows where he could have been. B came back with A and food for us and we sat down to eat. B pulled out his phone and spent the majority of the meal on social media or texting his friends and honestly it just upset me, I wanted us to take this vacation so we could have more family time and bond together. I told him to put the d*** phone down and just spend time with us and he said \u201cI\u2019ve spent enough time with you all already, honestly\u201d. I felt really disrespected by this, but I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.

He snapped at me and went \u201cGod, I\u2019d hate to ruin your trip Dad sorry\u201d super sarcastically and went to the room he has his stuff in.

Perhaps your youngest needs assistance, but the others are in their 20s! Young adults routinely go backpacking alone across multiple countries where they don't speak the language, but you're afraid of your children leaving the hotel for a few hours?

Not only are you pushing your responsibility on one of your children, you are wondering why your son snapped at you after being on a trip even you described as exhausting. If I see anyone \"ruining\" this trip for your family, it's you. You keep saying how instrumental B is, but then throw a tantrum over him taking his mind off over dinner? Maybe he is irritating because you keep pushing responsibilities on him while he is still recovering from the flu, while you are \"resting when possible\", just after he had to get his older brother, because you wouldn't.

Sorry if he wants to destress on his phone after going out and finding your missing child then that\u2019s ok.

If he doesn't live with you I would anticipate not talking to him for a bit when you all get home.", "YTA. You're daughter is right. 2 of you are sick. 1 of you likely doesn't travel well due to anxiety & depression.  The only healthy one is barely an adult & is in charge of all of you.

Did B want to come on this trip or was he repoed into it?", "YTA. Being disabled doesn't mean you get to order everyone around and lay all the responsibilities on your 20yo child. this is a trip YOU wanted to take, and it's not fair to lay all the responsibilities on one person to the point they can't even enjoy it. it's extremely stressful", "Not gonna say YTA but I'm definitely in B's side here too. Sounds like he's the only one making sure this trip doesn't end disastrously and doing a lot of mental and physical labor on vacation. It's not anyone's fault they got sick but I definitely would want to talk to other people at that point too. You're being overly demanding after he's done everything else you asked of him", "YTA. He just literally looked for YOUR ADULT SON for you, he\u2019s been solely responsible for keeping the trip together and you snap just because of a phone? Wow you must be fun on vacations. Congratulations on the last vacation your middle son will ever join you on.", "YTA..\n\n1. You have made B the defacto parent in this situation. Not once have I seen you delegate any of the responsibilities that you have foisted onto B to the other kids. Why aren't you stepping up and helping with this.\n2. Two of your kids are sick and you are having health issues. While family trips are great, taking this trip was probably a mistake given two of the three kids are down with something and you are down for most of the trip yourself.\n3. You're forcing a family bonding experience and not allowing the kids to have their space. I would imagine B is pretty fucking done right now and wants to escape. After all, this has \"been strenuous on all of our mental health.\" Vacations are suppose to be about decompression and self care. none of this is evident.\n4. B snapped at you because you took a powder on responsibility for the trip.\n\nThis could have been an awesome family trip. But you mismanaged this. You should Expect to be at the minimum Low Contact with B when you guys get back home. Your Daughter is right. You and A are on vacation and are expecting B to work it.", "YTA.

Shame on you.", "YTA - if you can\u2019t adequately take care of your kids on a trip the solution isn\u2019t to dump all the responsibility on one, it\u2019s to cancel the rest and go home early. This isn\u2019t fair.", "YTA. Apparently you planned a demanding trip while you're physically not capable of managing said trip. And all of the responsibility falls on B. He sounds more like a nurse or a butler than a son. And son A is the one who broke the rules, forcing son B to go look for him for hours, AND son B was kind enough to bring back some food, and yet you're mad at him and not A? What the hell? It sounds like this trip has been stressful and not really fun at all for B, so the least you can do is let him decompress on his phone for a bit.", "YTA.\n\nB has been carrying the family for this entire trip. Cut him some slack and let him take a break. As much as I believe in valuing family time over anything else, you targeting B for using his phone is a bad move, since A ran off on his own to the inconvenience of everyone else.\n\nThere's no reason you can't have family time and alone time in a trip. When you force family time, it breeds resentment.", "YTA 100%, you cannot expect a 20 year old to spend all his time doing everything for, it would seem, not just his siblings but also you as well. Your middle child went out (you claim for literal hours) to go get his OLDER sibling and from your own story doesn't complain but just goes on his phone? A very normal thing for a young adult to do? and your instant reaction is to cuss at him... You don't get how that makes you TA?\n\nTo top it off you bring it up again later and after the family has, presumably, moved on and expected what as a reaction? what an ill thought-out trip", "YTA\n\nSo basically B is providing 99% of the effectiveness for this trip and of he decided to leave the 3 of you wouldn't be able to handle it without him, but you don't think he deserves any kind of respite from carrying you all on his metaphorical back?\n\nYou sound ungrateful and dangerously close to biting the hand thats feeding you.", "YTA. First of all, B is an adult. He is carrying the whole responsibility for this trip and, therefore, it is completely understandable that after searching for his  brother for hours, he needs some rest (Be it being on his phone for hours or whatever it is he wants to do).\n\nJust let him be, he also needs to rest and just accept the fact that being on his phone is how he gets some. PD: him being on his phone doesn't mean he doesn't care o he's not 'there' on the family trip.", "YTA\n\nI'm 55M with 5 kids, so it's not just the young people here giving you the YTA answer.\n\nYour son B was the whole reason the trip wasn't a chaotic (and possibly tragic) mess.  Apart from allowing him to use his phone, I would've given him something extra for all the help.\n\nYou need to see the whole picture and appreciate what your kids do for you.  A and B are adults and you have to get used to not having as much control over them as you had in the past.  If you don't realize that, you may be in for some lonely times in your older years.", "YTA - all the previous comments sums up so well. It\u2019s not a holiday but a stressful errand for B, and instead thanking him you snap at him without no real reason. Being on the phone is not a huge deal.", "YTA, and YOU\u2019RE the one dragging down the trip for the whole family, not your son\u2026unbelievable!", "YTA for asking your son to put his phone down, but also for calling this a vacation. It honestly sounds extremely exhausting for all the parties involved. You as a parent are responsible when one of your children wanders of not your other son.

Of course the oldest agrees because he hasnt had to lift a finger. In a big way YTA.", "YTA.
