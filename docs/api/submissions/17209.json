If you are going to do a gesture, especially a small but hopefully meaningful and sentimental one, it\u2019s the effort that counts. That effort is comprised of a) not doing it like an afterthought (I.e you could have prepared it ahead of time) and b) making sure the content was suitably personalized and sentimental.

Then, upon hearing that Mother\u2019s Day is not the only day she gets off, you decided that OP did the bare minimum and he\u2019s the asshole.

That would not have been a problem if you had actually done it before.  You waited until the day of.  \n\nThe reason she's going off is because she realized yesterday during your talk that you didn't do anything in advance.  She was going in disappointed already.  \n\nESH but honestly I see why she started off in a bad mood.

Then you put in effort to make the day fun for you and the boys ( once again forgetting her ).\n\nThe day of, you somewhat get the boys tp do something and still haven't done anything yourself.\n\nThen you quickly cop out and google some words you put on a card and expect her to be happy?\n\nMate.. you managed to show her you don't care about her at all.\n\n\nMy wife's gift was done and ready with the kids gifts three weeks ago to account for mishaps / illness / etc...", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you using google to make your letter. It\u2019s about the fact that you didn\u2019t ask her or plan to celebrate her in any way until *yesterday*. \n\nMaybe she really wanted an item, or a brunch with her family or almost anything else but you asking yesterday means she knows you haven\u2019t even started thinking about what she might like. She is aware that last minute shopping or planning is unlikely to be successful and to ask it of you would but you under a lot of stress. So she went with something low-key, likely partly because she didn\u2019t have much choice, and even that you bungled. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t have used google to write her a nice card literally any time before today? Mother\u2019s Day is not a surprise. You had to know it was coming, there are ads literally everywhere. You come off as thoughtless and rushed and while it\u2019s nice you got the kids to make her cards and ensured that she got what she asked for in terms of having a day off, you dropped the ball on pre-planning and consideration. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t feel very appreciated either.", "YTA.  Why didn't you write the card the day before so it was ready to go?  And googling what to write sounds lazy.  She just wanted you to put in the effort to give her a heartfelt card on time.  She doesn't sound ungrateful - she sounds fed up and not appreciated enough for you to make sufficient effort.", "ESH. \n\nShe told you she wanted a card and the day off. She is currently getting the day off, and spending time with her friends. If she wanted more, she needed to tell you that. \n\n*However*, doing this the day before/of? Absolutely not okay. Mothers Day is the same day every year, and you could have done just a little bit of planning. You could have asked her earlier, the cards could have been made (and written) the weekend prior, and you could have made a plan that consisted of more than \u2018intercept children and make cards\u2019. You may have meant well, but she wanted two things from you: one, she apparently had to organise and celebrate herself, and two, was an unfinished afterthought. Yep, she\u2019s got every right to be irritated. \n\nNext Mother\u2019s Day, step up. You now know she likes a card and a day off. Make the cards with the kids the weekend before, find a poem you can quote for your card (poetry is romantic and shows you thought it out - Google is not) and either organise to take the kids out, or for her to go out  (maybe for something like a pedicure - but dear lord, don\u2019t make her organise it). You had all the pieces this year, so next time, all you need to do is put them together, better and earlier.", "This sounds so familiar to me, right down to the ADHD husband who\u2019s not very good with words. Chances are what your wife really wants is not to be an afterthought. She wants to be thought of, acknowledged, and put first for once. And she doesn\u2019t want to have to ask for it. NAH. But you CAN do better by planning better.", "ESH she should have been appreciative of you getting up with the kids and making cards. So she\u2019s an AH there. BUT, you are in every other way. You talked to her about it the day before. You made her Mother\u2019s Day card from her kids the day of and you didn\u2019t have yours done. No other gift? Didn\u2019t use your own words? Couldn\u2019t have it done beforehand? My husband is great at Mother\u2019s Day. I got to sleep in while he took all 3 kids, including the infant. He cooked breakfast (the one I requested), made coffee, plated it (cut it up, got their drinks, anything else they asked for). I got handmade gifts from the kids (all under 6) plus flowers plus gifts from them plus I get to have a massage. We are doing what I want. I know if we do activities outside the home I\u2019ll have to do diaper bag etc so I\u2019m choosing to have us hang at home so I get a day off. You having your kids so they didn\u2019t wake her up and making cards the morning of is absolute bare minimum. If you\u2019ve done this in the past she\u2019s obviously over it and exhausted. Step up and be a partner who shows their appreciation for at least one day a year.", "ESH but mostly you for a half-assed card as if you didn\u2019t have ample time to do something meaningful. You just didn\u2019t want to. I imagine this isn\u2019t totally about the card either.", "ESH\n\nShe needs to communicate more effectively about what is behind her Mother\u2019s Day frustrations. \n\nYou need to think better, overall. \n\n\nhot tip: \n\nif you finish the card and plans before the actual day- it feels more like you put thought and care into it. You\u2019re supposed to have it ready to gift the day of. Just like for bdays you buy a present before the day- just like other days/holidays that involve gift giving.\n\nNobody wants to be an obligation or an afterthought. You asked her what she wanted the day before. Now the mental load is on her to decide *and it\u2019s the day before* . You didn\u2019t have your kids making their little cards until it was already Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nYou need time to write something? Give yourself time. It should be done the week prior at least and your busy with kids so make sure you start it a month in advance so you\u2019ll have it done for her that day. \n\nYou are not an asshole for needing time to write, or using the internet to help translate your thoughtful- you ARE TA for not having I done the day of. Needing time isn\u2019t an excuse. You have time you just didn\u2019t start it early enough. \n\nNext time give her the day off, without her having to ask it, make breakfast and send her off for a massage or something. Get her a card, write \u201cI love you, enjoy your day\u201d in its. Make sure there are flowers on the kitchen table. Use your heart. \n\nIf you start doing things like that and taking on some of that invisible labour I suspect your wife is inundated with I think you\u2019ll find she gets you more than a mug for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nThis is definitely a sign of a much bigger dissatisfaction within your relationship.", "NTA, but your wife.....yikes.

I know it frustrates him. As such, I would not be angry in the slightest if he used google or anything else to help. And honestly if your wife knows this is something you struggle with, nitpicking on it like that is so rude and hurtful. \n\nI\u2019m not a mom yet, but I feel like in her shoes I\u2019d love a break to spend time with friends, and handmade cards from kids and husband is so sweet. She just comes off as petulant and ungrateful. NTA", "NTA but a word to the wise. Your wife sounds testy. Literally. She's disatisfied with your performance within the marriage and she's not doing a good job communicating. Maybe she's tried to tell you that she's feeling unappreciated or invisible and feels she isn't heard. \n\nFor future reference \"I don't want to do anything\" means kids making breakfast and delivering it in bed, a huge card with flowers in it signed with the kids' handprints and a sickly-sweet bath bomb so she can soak while she reads Cosmo.

There's that time she was there for you when you were sick, how she handled a situation with your children, how she shows her love for all of you in  selfless ways.", "Sorry to hear this, OP.

His wife didn\u2019t respond graciously or communicate her expectations well, but at the same time it isn\u2019t rocket science to prepare a gift and card a few days prior at the latest. No wonder she is upset.", "Why would he write her a card from him? She\u2019s not his mother\u2026", "Considering that he said he doesn't write very well, she probably Googled a few lines off it to see if it was a copy of what was online when his note sounded overly flowery.", "You could ask questions instead of playing \"LOL men suck\" or something. But that would require effort and maybe breaking out of your narrow minded world view. And Lord knows we can't have that.", "Hahah I got -4 downvotes for that smile. You better enjoy it \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2d", "They have a young child who still sleeps in a crib so I was thinking ppd", "Secondary question - what happens typically on Father's Day and for planning it?", "I think your wife is exhausted, physically and mentally. Sometimes when you ask someone what they want, it's almost like another chore for them. She might feel like you didn't put effort into the day, even though you clearly did, because she might have a need she herself doesn't even know she has.\n\nIt sounds like your kids are young. I've been there! I don't think you did anything wrong, and I don't think you have anything to make up for, but I have an idea for marital harmony?\n\nMaybe book her a surprise massage next weekend, and tell her to get lunch out by herself after. She might need to feel pampered and taken care of herself, because being a mother to such young children is literally entirely caring for others before yourself \ud83d\udcaf of the time.", "Ok, so why didn't you write the note in advance since you've had all year to know about it?  \n\nYou didn't get any clarification until the day before?  \n\nIt really sounds like you didn't take any time to think or plan anything until *right* before.  And yeah, anyone would feel disappointed by that.  \n\nAll this would have been solved by directly asking last weekend what she wanted for today, and writing the note at any point before the day of.  \n\nStill doesn't excuse her snapping.   Just explains it.  She now knows you didn't care enough to do anything until the same day.", "Yeah but do you see how when he does handle something she's unhappy because it isn't done to her exact specifications? That's how you end up having to do and ask for everything because no one around wants to take initiative in anything because they might make a mistake and piss you off.", "There was literally zero need for her to manage anything in the household here. Like, none,  zero, nothing at all. There was no mental load involved here either.", "Maybe ask her what would make her feel special for next Mother\u2019s Day since you\u2019re having a hard time appeasing her. Emphasis on special. I personally think that since there are 5 major events in a year women seem to care so much about, valentines, Mother\u2019s Day, birthday, anniversary, and Christmas, that there\u2019s no way you can pull out all the stops 5 times a year and that actual adults don\u2019t need to be validated and celebrated that often for living a lifestyle we all chose. We chose to get married and we chose to have kids and we also chose who we married and had kids with. I\u2019ve never expected thanks for the sacrifices I\u2019ve made for my family because I chose to have a family knowing I would have to make sacrifices.", "Untreated ppd doesn\u2019t just go away as the kid gets older, it could still be a problem - if it actually were something in the realm of ppd", "I don't know anyone (lived in 4 different states in the US) that didn't celebrate their partner as well if they had kids.  \n\nI would consider it extremely weird if I heard they didn't.  And many in my field circle have children and grandchildren even.\n\nIt's typical if you live in a happy household to celebrate the partner as well.  You may be thinking of households that aren't so happy.", "Most families sound unappreciative and miserable", "Yeah, I got my mom lots of sardines as her Mom Day gift this year because she loves them but won't splurge on the pricier high quality brands like her \"financially irresponsible\" daughter will. If I showed up with a diamond tennis bracelet she'd probably choke me with it for wasting money, hahahaha.", "And as I said, asking the day before and writing his note the day of really shows a huge lack of consideration.  \n\nHe would have had to go out that night to get things if she said she wanted anything.  And that's still her having to think for him instead of him being considerate.   \n\nOP didn't even make a note until she asked about it. \n\nOf course she was already going in disappointed; he told her going in that he did nothing, planned nothing, and wanted her to plan it instead.", "The holiday isn\u2019t just for kids to appreciate their mom. It\u2019s for a man to a show appreciation to the mother of their children. \n\nI can understand if you\u2019ve only celebrated the holiday from the kid\u2019s POV that you\u2019d think that.", "Wow that\u2019s interesting! I guess since it\u2019s more of a significant day here so it\u2019s a bigger deal to Americans. Maybe we should stop celebrating after kids are toddlers so we can save a pretty penny lmao", "It\u2019s also a day for the father to show appreciation to the mother of their kids. Not just for the kids to show appreciation to their mom.", "He can plan a nice day with his boys in advance, then he can also write a bloody card in advance.\n\nBeing ND doesn't excuse being a crappy partner", "Thank you for this, I felt like I was going insane. Mother\u2019s Day isn\u2019t just for your own mother but any mother that has made a substantial impact in your life, I\u2019m not sure why this concept seems so wild. The mother of your children included, and I\u2019m almost certain everybody saying \u201cshe\u2019s not your mom\u201d expects the entire universe to bend on Father\u2019s Day.", "She's a hypocrite, considering how she handles father's day. XD", "She\u2019s the mother of his children. She\u2019s his wife\u2026 I think it\u2019s safe to assume that she at least take care of some of the household duties. So yes! He should write down how much he appreciate her for growing a human and either pushing that human out or getting cut open to get that child or helping with the adoption process or helping steal a child.\n\n\n[Mother\u2019s Day](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mothers-Day) is about celebrating mothers not just yours.", "She probably would have appreciated it much more if he wrote his own words badly.", "Or some people are just assholes.", "Last year, I got a coffee mug, that I didn\u2019t even know I got until I found it in the glass drawer \ud83d\ude23", "> Yeah but do you see how when he does handle something she's unhappy because it isn't done to her exact specifications?\n\nYou mean after he told her the day before that he hadn't made any plans, told her to come up with the plan herself, and did nothing in advance?  \n\nHe ***DIDN\u2019T*** handle this.  He asked her to plan it so he didn't have to.\n\nShe's not mad that it wasn't good enough.  She's mad that he didn't prepare anything and did it the day of ***and*** highlighted it to her the day before that he didn't care enough to try up to that point.", "Sounds like he gets what he's given, since last year he got a mug he didn't even know he was given until he found it in the cabinet. You people are just desperate to make all women look like saints and all men look like pigs. XD\n\nYou're not owed a card for Mother's Day, princess. All she asked for was a day off. He's doing that plus making sure the boys wrote some out for her. Y'all are just desperate and sad at this point.", "Sounds to me like he tried his best and got an ungrateful response from his wife. He gave a reason for doing things last minute and it's pretty reasonable to me. What kind of a person demands a card from their husband for mothers day especially after he got his children to write their own.\n\nEdit: ironically you mention in your comment about him being a crappy partner when it's his wife who is the crappy one.", "You're not crazy.  When I scrolled down after reading I fully expected a huge wave of ESH.   Instead there was post after post of people thinking asking the day before was in any way acceptable.  \n\nThis is ridiculous.  He basically told her \"I didn't care enough to ask until the day before, and I've done nothing in advance.  Tell me what you want me to do last minute.  You better be excited for receiving anything and shouldn't be disappointed about being a last minute afterthought.\"", "Hence the ESH.", "It's sad that a Mom can't appreciate a goofy card her kiddos drew. I got one from my ten year old on Friday and absolutely love it. \n\nI don't get cards from my spouse because he's not my kiddo. He does coordinate gifts, and my kid picks the best stuff out. I could get a painted rock and appreciate the thought and craft that went into it.\n\nBut maybe the relationship isn't healthy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah. Not like the immense planning she put into, what was it? A mug he didn't even know he was given until he found it in the cabinet? Sounds like the wife knows all about effort when it comes to Mother's/Father's day. You are so desperate to hold on to your penis=bad narrative you can't stand it. Just keep moving the goal post like a true bigot.\n\nBet you have black friends that you secretly talk shit about, too. Typical for you kind of people.", "Op replied to me and their kid in the crib is 3 so I\u2019m leaning heavily towards NTA.", "Explain the whole thing.  \n\n - what's done on the day \n - what plans are made \n - what do the kids do \n - what happens around the house \n - what's said in advance\n\nYou're making really short posts while not giving details.  Please give full details to questions if you want unbiased answers.  If you give short answers then it comes across as trying to shift it a certain way.  \n\nIf you want unpartial responses then give detailed answers.  I'm more than willing to take your side if you give all details but if you give few details then it comes across as you wanting to hide things and get validation.", "I just want to point out that you're saying this after OP has responded that yesterday wasn't the first time they talked about it.", "You seem to be taking this very personally - did we find the wife???", "> You mean after he told her the day before that he hadn't made any plans, told her to come up with the plan herself, and did nothing in advance?\n\nSeriously, what exact long plans do you need for mothers days here? Is there any reason to think that there is between them an expectation of elaborate planning for mothers days and fathers days that he somehow skipped?\n\nBecause fairly normal thing to happen is that kids give out their little gifts and then there is either family outing or mom goes do her own thing. But in no way I expect the husband to plan it super in advance as if it was yet another elaborate valentine day.", "Basically, no wonder she just wanted to be allowed to go out for the day unbothered. It\u2019s not like she was going to be getting much anyways, apparently", "Agreed that it's probably not PPD at that point.  It could certainly still be depression, though, and/or feeling overwhelmed by things in her life (childcare and any other obligations).  Either way, she clearly doesn't seem happy.", "Duuuude...", "You're digging really hard to find some reason you can blame him.", "Chill the fuck out\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gu7jh/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_restaurant_during_my/jk2g0at?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "No. It\u2019s very simple in this sub. When it\u2019s a husband Vs wife things, either husband is wrong and he should be divorced really quickly or the wife could be wrong but there are underlying reasons and even there husband is at fault.", "What?  He'll detail what he did but won't do the same the other way around.   It shows a clear want of validation.  \n\nHe needs to present Mother's Day and Father's Day side by side for a comparison.   Then we can see if there's a clear lopsidedness.  \n\nBy not doing that, it appears like he wants validation.   If she asks a week in advance and he says he wants nothing, that's a ***huge*** difference than him asking the day before.   A week in advance shows thought and wanting to plan.  The day before shows no planning and treating someone like an afterthought.  \n\nMaybe she doesn't plan properly.  Maybe she does.  We can't know if he doesn't say."]}
