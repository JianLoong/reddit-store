Am I the asshole here?\n\nMy wife told me yesterday: \u201cAll I want for Mother\u2019s Day is to have the day completely off. I don\u2019t need or want anything else.\u201d\n\nI confirmed with her multiple times, and then started planning a day for my two boys and I.\n\nToday comes by\n- I intercept my oldest son at 7am before he comes into our room. We go downstairs to watch his favorite morning show and to eat breakfast.\n- The moment I heard my youngest wake up, I got him out of his crib and downstairs.\n- We finish breakfast, and I have them start working on handmade cards for my wife.\n- when I hear her get up, we surprise her with the cards from the kids.\n\nHere is where things go wrong. \n\nMy wife asks me: \u201cDid you write me anything?\u201d \nI told her I was working on it, but wasn\u2019t done, I had been busy with the kids and wanted to finish it up. She was not happy.\n\nI quickly finish it up, and sent it to her. \n- a note on this, I\u2019m not a very well spoken person, I have a hard time putting my thoughts together, so I used google to turn my thoughts into a letter. She knows I struggle in this area.\n\nI come inside, and she tells me that I \u201cplagiarized\u201d and used google for her letter. I told her I absolutely did, but that the main points were mine. \n\nI then sent her the \u201coriginal\u201d and she scoffed and said \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nSo Reddit \n- am I the asshole for using google to make myself sound elegant? \n- am I the asshole for not writing \u201cenough\u201d in my original?\n\nFinal thought - She told me \u201call she wanted was a day off.\u201d She is still getting that, and is currently out with all her girlfriends.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nQuick Edit - had an awesome day with my boys, wife was nowhere to be found for most of it, and I have to say, it\u2019s the best day we (my boys and I) have had in awhile.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit #2 - I just saw a post on Facebook about how she\u2019s had an awesome day with the boys\u2026. She\u2019s still out with her girlfriends getting her nails/hair done\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit #3 (final) - kids are in bed, wife just got home and asked me if I still planned on working out tonight. I straight up told her I was exhausted and going to bed. She\u2019s now not talking to me. I\u2019m so done with her attitude and the drama she brings to the table .", "created_utc": 1684074934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hdueo/aita_wife_doesnt_like_having_the_day_off_or_my/", "score": 6438, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, given that the long drawn out story about what you did with your kids is much like every other weekend, your \u201cgift\u201d to her was half-a**ing a card, I\u2019m not surprised at her reaction. If you are going to do a gesture, especially a small but hopefully meaningful and sentimental one, it\u2019s the effort that counts. That effort is comprised of a) not doing it like an afterthought (I.e you could have prepared it ahead of time) and b) making sure the content was suitably personalized and sentimental.

Then, upon hearing that Mother\u2019s Day is not the only day she gets off, you decided that OP did the bare minimum and he\u2019s the asshole.

If someone asks the day before, you know they didn't do anything yet and won't have anything ready.  \n\nYour excuse for not having a card for her was because you hadn't done it yet because of the kids.  That would not have been a problem if you had actually done it before.  You waited until the day of.  \n\nThe reason she's going off is because she realized yesterday during your talk that you didn't do anything in advance.  She was going in disappointed already.  \n\nESH but honestly I see why she started off in a bad mood.  You set the bar exceptionally low by only talking to her the day before and doing nothing in advance.", "How often do you plan things the day before and then need to rush to get things done?", "...you used google, as in you had an AI write a note? \n\nI would also be pissed at you if that's what you did.

Then you put in effort to make the day fun for you and the boys ( once again forgetting her ).\n\nThe day of, you somewhat get the boys tp do something and still haven't done anything yourself.\n\nThen you quickly cop out and google some words you put on a card and expect her to be happy?\n\nMate.. you managed to show her you don't care about her at all.\n\n\nMy wife's gift was done and ready with the kids gifts three weeks ago to account for mishaps / illness / etc...", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you using google to make your letter. It\u2019s about the fact that you didn\u2019t ask her or plan to celebrate her in any way until *yesterday*. \n\nMaybe she really wanted an item, or a brunch with her family or almost anything else but you asking yesterday means she knows you haven\u2019t even started thinking about what she might like. She is aware that last minute shopping or planning is unlikely to be successful and to ask it of you would put you under a lot of stress. So she went with something low-key, likely partly because she didn\u2019t have much choice, and even that you bungled. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t have used google to write her a nice card literally any time before today? Mother\u2019s Day is not a surprise. You had to know it was coming, there are ads literally everywhere. You come off as thoughtless and rushed and while it\u2019s nice you got the kids to make her cards and ensured that she got what she asked for in terms of having a day off, you dropped the ball on pre-planning and consideration. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t feel very appreciated either.", "YTA.  Why didn't you write the card the day before so it was ready to go?  And googling what to write sounds lazy.  She just wanted you to put in the effort to give her a heartfelt card on time.  She doesn't sound ungrateful - she sounds fed up and not appreciated enough for you to make sufficient effort.", "ESH. \n\nShe told you she wanted a card and the day off. She is currently getting the day off, and spending time with her friends. If she wanted more, she needed to tell you that. \n\n*However*, doing this the day before/of? Absolutely not okay. Mothers Day is the same day every year, and you could have done just a little bit of planning. You could have asked her earlier, the cards could have been made (and written) the weekend prior, and you could have made a plan that consisted of more than \u2018intercept children and make cards\u2019. You may have meant well, but she wanted two things from you: one, she apparently had to organise and celebrate herself, and two, was an unfinished afterthought. Yep, she\u2019s got every right to be irritated. \n\nNext Mother\u2019s Day, step up. You now know she likes a card and a day off. Make the cards with the kids the weekend before, find a poem you can quote for your card (poetry is romantic and shows you thought it out - Google is not) and either organise to take the kids out, or for her to go out  (maybe for something like a pedicure - but dear lord, don\u2019t make her organise it). You had all the pieces this year, so next time, all you need to do is put them together, better and earlier.", "This sounds so familiar to me, right down to the ADHD husband who\u2019s not very good with words. Chances are what your wife really wants is not to be an afterthought. She wants to be thought of, acknowledged, and put first for once. And she doesn\u2019t want to have to ask for it. NAH. But you CAN do better by planning better.", "[deleted]", "ESH but mostly you for a half-assed card as if you didn\u2019t have ample time to do something meaningful. You just didn\u2019t want to. I imagine this isn\u2019t totally about the card either.", "ESH\n\nShe needs to communicate more effectively about what is behind her Mother\u2019s Day frustrations. \n\nYou need to think better, overall. \n\n\nhot tip: \n\nif you finish the card and plans before the actual day- it feels more like you put thought and care into it. You\u2019re supposed to have it ready to gift the day of. Just like for bdays you buy a present before the day- just like other days/holidays that involve gift giving.\n\nNobody wants to be an obligation or an afterthought. You asked her what she wanted the day before. Now the mental load is on her to decide *and it\u2019s the day before* . You didn\u2019t have your kids making their little cards until it was already Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nYou need time to write something? Give yourself time. It should be done the week prior at least and your busy with kids so make sure you start it a month in advance so you\u2019ll have it done for her that day. \n\nYou are not an asshole for needing time to write, or using the internet to help translate your thoughtful- you ARE TA for not having I done the day of. Needing time isn\u2019t an excuse. You have time you just didn\u2019t start it early enough. \n\nNext time give her the day off, without her having to ask it, make breakfast and send her off for a massage or something. Get her a card, write \u201cI love you, enjoy your day\u201d in its. Make sure there are flowers on the kitchen table. Use your heart. \n\nIf you start doing things like that and taking on some of that invisible labour I suspect your wife is inundated with I think you\u2019ll find she gets you more than a mug for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nThis is definitely a sign of a much bigger dissatisfaction within your relationship.", "[deleted]", "NTA or soft ESH because she didn\u2019t seem to communicate what she expected - but I would be upset if my husband copy pasted some stuff from online about our love or whatever.

I know it frustrates him. As such, I would not be angry in the slightest if he used google or anything else to help. And honestly if your wife knows this is something you struggle with, nitpicking on it like that is so rude and hurtful. \n\nI\u2019m not a mom yet, but I feel like in her shoes I\u2019d love a break to spend time with friends, and handmade cards from kids and husband is so sweet. She just comes off as petulant and ungrateful. NTA", "NTA but a word to the wise. Your wife sounds testy. Literally.

Sometimes when you ask someone what they want, it's almost like another chore for them. She might feel like you didn't put effort into the day, even though you clearly did, because she might have a need she herself doesn't even know she has.\n\nIt sounds like your kids are young. I've been there! I don't think you did anything wrong, and I don't think you have anything to make up for, but I have an idea for marital harmony?\n\nMaybe book her a surprise massage next weekend, and tell her to get lunch out by herself after. She might need to feel pampered and taken care of herself, because being a mother to such young children is literally entirely caring for others before yourself \ud83d\udcaf of the time.", "Ok, so why didn't you write the note in advance since you've had all year to know about it?  \n\nYou didn't get any clarification until the day before?  \n\nIt really sounds like you didn't take any time to think or plan anything until *right* before.

I have a feeling that something else is going on here that only has a little bit to do with Mother's Day.  You and your wife need to talk.  Maybe with a therapist.  I don't think her unhappiness was all about today. Also, the fact that you were in a hurry to get some validation on reddit immediately says that there's probably more going on with you, too.  Neither one of you is communicating well with the other.  My husband and I have been together for almost thirty years (with two kids), and there have been plenty of ups and downs.

My husband and I wrote out our feelings and then had strict rules about listening and giving the letter writer time to fully say their piece before interrupting when we had some issues. We also made lists of the behaviors or habits that really frustrated/annoyed/hurt us.

Honestly, I'd put **not the asshole**, but I don't really think your wife is completely out of line for being upset with what she got from you.\n\nAs someone who has a partner who is similarly not particularly well spoken, I would be pretty bummed if they copied a letter off of google and just changed it enough that the teacher might not notice, so to speak. The intent was great, but there's a lack of thought and consideration in the gift itself. Sure, she didn't ask you for one beforehand, and said that all she wanted was a day off, but there are two issues that could be the issue in that:\n\n1. A day off implies that she does the greater portion of childcare, enough that it is *unusual* and out of character for you to do the bulk of it. Your wife may not say so, but it's possible she resents this, and feels like she's not being considered. If she's a stay at home parent, her job is just as difficult and trying as yours - and she doesn't *get* days off, like you might.   \nShe may resent this. She may want a day off, but she wants it to be one that proves you think about her and respect the effort she puts in for your family. Plus? A day off, from a partner who is also a parent to your children, isn't a gift. It's an expectation that you each should have time to focus on yourselves on occasion. It should be made special if it's for a special day. \n2. If the former is the issue - that she feels unthought of and not considered - she probably didn't want to ask you for a specific gift, because that's a lot of emotional labour for her to do for something that's supposed to be *your* purview and responsibility.   \nIn one comment, you say that you usually give her flowers, but that's not really a personal sort of gift, is it? Unless your wife is a big fan of them, it's just... boring. Part of the 'traditional' package of romantic gifts - flowers, and chocolate. If you're thinking of your partner, and pay attention to them and their needs, you should have at least some idea of what they might like. Maybe you could have planned a nice bath for her, some candles and a bath bomb, music she likes, or a show on a portable device like an iPad for her to watch. Or you could have sent her with her girlfriends to a restaurant she likes. These are the best I've come up with without knowing more about your wife, but *you* know her. \n\nYour wife wants to know that you care about her. That you *think* about her. Even a list of what you like about her, in the simplest of terms, would be a better idea - because those things would come from *you*. Not google. \n\nIf you're too anxious about getting it wrong because she may get upset and you dislike the consequences of that, that's something you two should communicate about as well.
