We go downstairs to watch his favorite morning show and to eat breakfast.\n- The moment I heard my youngest wake up, I got him out of his crib and downstairs.\n- We finish breakfast, and I have them start working on handmade cards for my wife.\n- when I hear her get up, we surprise her with the cards from the kids.\n\nHere is where things go wrong. \n\nMy wife asks me: \u201cDid you write me anything?\u201d \nI told her I was working on it, but wasn\u2019t done, I had been busy with the kids and wanted to finish it up. She was not happy.\n\nI quickly finish it up, and sent it to her. \n- a note on this, I\u2019m not a very well spoken person, I have a hard time putting my thoughts together, so I used google to turn my thoughts into a letter. She knows I struggle in this area.\n\nI come inside, and she tells me that I \u201cplagiarized\u201d and used google for her letter. I told her I absolutely did, but that the main points were mine. \n\nI then sent her the \u201coriginal\u201d and she scoffed and said \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nSo Reddit \n- am I the asshole for using google to make myself sound elegant? \n- am I the asshole for not writing \u201cenough\u201d in my original?\n\nFinal thought - She told me \u201call she wanted was a day off.\u201d She is still getting that, and is currently out with all her girlfriends.", "created_utc": 1684074934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hdueo/aita_wife_doesnt_like_having_the_day_off_or_my/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's great to give her a break and even better to teach your children to honor their mother on the holiday. Often one of the best things a father can do on Mother's Day is to prioritize the mother of his children over his own mother. \n\nIf she really expects people to do special things for her on this particular holiday then she needs to be the one to teach the children.

What I don't get, is why she wanted a card or letter personally from YOU? I mean, I'm a mum, I love getting the cards from my kids.

It sounds like whatever you do will never be right or enough.", "Nta.", "NTA.", "NTA I use google all the time. I\u2019m terrible at writing sentimental notes.

It doesn\u2019t feel like a day off if she has to pay for it later by cleaning up a huge mess or just doing double chores the next day.", "It's mother's day, not 'write me a letter and I'll judge your grammar' day.\n\nNTA.", "Done flowers before, she told me last year she was tired of them", "Normally I do flowers.

The minute my SO tried this manipulative bullshit on me is the minute I'd be single again. We're adults and adults can communicate.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure there was a post very recently about someone whose partner assumed they were lying about what they wanted, went \"above and beyond\" and, was then upset that the effort wasn't appreciated.", "Why do you assume that it\u2019s her only day off? Why would he need to make an effort. She\u2019s not his mom and he made sure that the kids made a card and she had a day without responsibilities. Why would he need to give her a card or flowers?

It might be absolutely what's right for your family and for you but I'd have been really upset if my husband had ignored mother's day. He didn't have to do a ton, just a card and small gift from our daughter (who was 2 months old because mother's day is in March in the UK) but I also really needed to hear him say/read in a card that he thinks I'm a good mum, that he thinks I'm doing well with looking after our daughter and that he's proud of me. I will absolutely be doing the same for him on father's day in a month.", "She's an adult and you're not a mind reader. She said she wanted a day off, you gave her a day off. If she can't expressly tell you want she wants then that's her problem.", "Then maybe next year it\u2019s nothing?", "Your wife seems hard to please.... Maybe stop trying, then at least you can expect the disappointment.", "Good for you.\n\nNTA, you cannot win with her.", "Because he\u2019s acting like it\u2019s a great gift for him to parent his kids for once in the morning, and her asking for \u201call I want is a day off\u201d implies it\u2019s an unusual occurrence. All I can go off is what OP wrote", "So why does she say that \u201call she wants for Mother\u2019s Day is a day off\u201d if that\u2019s what she has every weekend?", "That\u2019s a lot of assumptions. There\u2019s literally nothing in the post which implies this.", "No, you are just making shit up as you go. You sound like a misandrist.", "I take the lead on the weekends. She wanted a day out with her girlfriends. Which is where she is now.", "Glad to hear it! So, given that the long drawn out story about what you did with your kids is much like every other weekend, your \u201cgift\u201d to her was half-a**ing a card, I\u2019m not surprised at her reaction. If you are going to do a gesture, especially a small but hopefully meaningful and sentimental one, it\u2019s the effort that counts. That effort is comprised of a) not doing it like an afterthought (I.e you could have prepared it ahead of time) and b) making sure the content was suitably personalized and sentimental. It sounds like you didn\u2019t manage either of those, and it\u2019s a fairly low bar you set for yourself.\n\nI\u2019m sticking with YTA\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the basement-dwelling masses on Reddit support you - your wife isn\u2019t happy and hers is the only opinion you should care about.", "Yeah so you were just going to say OP was TA no matter what.", "It\u2019s a sub asking my opinion\u2026 or is no one allowed to disagree with yours?", "He said, complaining that I dare disagree with him.\n\nIf you need it spelled out for you, which, unfortunately, I think you do, let me explain.\n\nYou asked if Mother\u2019s Day is the only day she has off and stated in the same comment that if Mother\u2019s Day is the only day she gets off then OP did the bare minimum and he\u2019s the asshole.  Then, upon hearing that Mother\u2019s Day is not the only day she gets off, you decided that OP did the bare minimum and he\u2019s the asshole.  You gave him a question that had two possible answers, and both of those answers resulted in him doing the bare minimum and being the asshole in your opinion.\n\nNow that that\u2019s spelled out for you, can you understand why I said you were just gonna call in the asshole no matter what or should I draw some pictures for you to?", "No, just that you've cherry picked and created a narrative totally divorced from the post, then tried to defend it by calling anyone that disagrees \"basement dwelling\", rather than entertain the idea that you may actually be wrong.", "your original comment was completely uninformed & your follow up comment is overly long and provides no meaningful insight or fresh perspective into the situation beyond affirming your preconceived judgement", "By all means, keep drawing pictures, this is entertaining!", "Ah, the joke deflection with no substantive argument to accompany it.  I\u2019ll take this says you realizing that you\u2019re wrong and your opinion was stupid, but not wanting to admit it."]}
