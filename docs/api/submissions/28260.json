Both form a safety standards and to keep people form running unwanted/illegal activities from the room that could damage the hotels and its reputation such as gambeling or pr0stitution", "Every hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in has limits on how many people can stay in the room as well as how many additional guests you\u2019re allowed to have at any given time.", "I\u2019ve worked in several. Most add a charge per person over base occupancy (usually 2, so you\u2019d pay extra for a third) or straight up ban extra guests.", "Not always. There are also lots of hotels where you pay for X persons per room. At least when breakfast is included. But none the less, if you book a room you usually have to say how many people are staying in it.\n\nNot sure about the US but here it is also a safety measure, e.g. in case of a fire the number of people staying has to be known.", "Thays not true otherwise what's to stop 15 people sleeping in one room to save money? \n\nHave you ever booked a room where you didn't have to say how many people were staying?", "A hotel has a liablity and responsiblity. Fire escape routes and extinguishers are designed to let X amount of people out withing a certain time frame. If there is more then X amount of people there they would be at serious risk. Also a hotel has a right no know who is on their property in case of damages and wants to prevent any kind of illegal or \"commercial\" activity. Other guests could easily mistake OP's behaviour for pr0stitution, which is a immage most hotels want to avoid.\n\nAlso there is no hot bunking in hotels. You pay them for a place to sleep. But that is exlusive to the people who registered as quests. Otherwise they are just undermining their own business.", "I don\u2019t know where you are based but traveling all over the world, I\u2019ve never been to a hotel where you paid per room rather than per person. Single use of a double is cheaper and adding an extra person if possible costs you extra. To me it\u2019s a crazy thought you can just stay in hotel with as many people as you like.", "In India, it\u2019s per person. However, you\u2019re allowed to have guests as long as they don\u2019t stay the night. If you do have extra guests, you get charged per guest.", "It varies by location. In college, a group of 6 of us studying abroad in Spain wanted one hotel room because we were college students and didn\u2019t care for two nights. The hotel policy was 2 people per room. They made us pay for two more rooms.\n\nWe ended up leaving the city a day early due to safety concerns, but that was my experience of it\u2019s not always by room.", "In Europe you pay per person.", "I work at a hotel and if you have more than 2 guests, the rate is higher. Pretty standard at most hotels in the US.", "There is no hot bunking or subletting in a hotel. You pay for two specific people to be there. Thats how they make a profit.  THis was not one of the two, so that makes this a third.\n\nHotels also have responsibility to be aware of who is staying from a safety point as well as damages and illegal activity like gambeling or Pr0stitution.", "stop being obtuse. You know damn well what the limit means.", "So nervous you forgot the door chain?", "Keys? Where was this hotel, 1992? They didn\u2019t use cards?", "now that OP would have to charge for \ud83e\udd14", "Limit, yes. Occupancy charge, no. Separate things. And never heard of a night auditor stopping every person coming through to see if they have a room or are visiting.", "Well I've stayed in a lot of hotels and had a lot of one night stands and nobody ever said shit about it, like most people, and it doesn't sound like this person had anything to say about it either until she thought she heard opportunity knockin.", "which she didn't do. if she just explain the rules and enforced them she would be totally in the right. but she didn't explain anything.", "> Calling this interaction blankly demanding stuff is a stretch at best, and intentionally misleading and dismissive at worst\n\nthen what do you call this: \n\n> She doesn\u2019t explain anymore and just keeps demanding my deposit right then and there.", "So you\u2019ve never had a friend come up to your room to get ready or watch a movie or anything? \n\nYou\u2019ve never brought someone up for a couple hours just to chill? I find that odd. When I stay at a hotel I\u2019m usually visiting someone. Like my sister came up to watch a movie between having lunch and meeting up with our parents. Is that illegal and an Ahole move because of liability?", "There's nothing illegal about casual sex, this story presumably didn't happen in Qatar. \n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about.", "Yep, I have a husband and kid. We book accommodation, it asks how many adults and how many kids. Usually if the accommodation has *capacity* for extra people they'll charge a surcharge for it. Eg we've paid extra for a bed for kiddo. Otherwise they'll just have a strict cap on numbers. I'm in Australia, for reference.", "There are no hotels where the penalty for that violation is sexual assault.", "Breakfast is almost never included, or if it is it's like... a banana and coffee.\n\nBut yeah, never in my life seen a hotel that charges per person. You're renting the same amount of space whether theres two or six people in it. \n\nI get the fire thing, but it's still ridiculous to flip out over one temporary visitor", "The rule that sets a maximum occupancy limit. \n\nI just checked on hotels.com for Pigeon Forge TN, Atlanta GA, and Asheville, NC. Changing the number of people doesn't change the prices of the rooms displayed, it just eliminates some hotels that don't allow that many people in a room.", "But they don't charge for someone visiting your room for an hour.", "Yeah you pay per person but I\u2019ve never been heading up to my room with a one night stand and had the hotel demand I pay for them. \n\nSo I still find this super strange.", "There are plenty of places you haven\u2019t travelled, then. Both per room and per person are common.\n\nI\u2019ve found generally in the States it\u2019s per room (up to occupancy limit, not 15 people per room), and Europe is maybe 50/50.", "You can't, they do have max occupancy limits. But it's the same price whether 1 person or 5 people are staying in it. That's why you can get rooms with 2 queen sized beds and a pullout bed in most hotels.", "the most logical assumption is \"people that stay at the room long term/overnight\".", "It means people staying overnight. Not even the employee disputes that (\"if it was for 30 minutes it's allowed\")", "dude the guest was a bootycall. \n\nyou don't have to pay for someone just being in your room.", "Somehow I think OP does charge her \u201cfriends\u201d", "WHen you are at home do you usually hang out with your guest in your bedroom? I'm guessing not. So why would this be different. If people want to chill there is a lobby. \n\nAnd yes it was.", "Do they ask for a fee for anyone who might visit your room for an hour?", "She was barging in and not sexually assaulting anyone.", "Many hotels where im at have a rate for 1-2 people and then another for additional people.", "Then you are staying in different hotels than I do. In Germany breakfast is usually included and you have check if the price is per room or per person.\n\nBut the receptionist could also be aware of hotel thieves and therefore ask questions. The barging in isn't okay, but I do understand at least her questioning of the whole situation before because that's suspicious.", "Where are these hotels where you can stay with as many people as you like? What kind of hotels do you stay at that they don\u2019t serve more than a banana and a coffee?", "Whenever I book a hotel, the price changes based on the number of people - a twin room with one person is cheaper than the same room for two people.", "It\u2019s unclear if OP actually explained the visitor was only going to be there for an hour. Plus if they\u2019re showing up after midnight, it\u2019s not super far fetched to think they\u2019ll stay overnight.", "How do you pay per person? You book a room with a king bed, it doesn't matter if there are one or two people, the price is the same. The hotel wants to know who is staying there so they do ask for all the names of guests, but that has nothing to do with the rate. If you booked a room with two beds, even if there was only one person on the reservation, the rate wouldn't change. The number of beds allowed per room is a matter of safety (mainly fire safety). So you can put 5 people in a room with two beds and request a rollaway cot, but you can't book 6 people into a room with two beds and 2 rollaway cots. It all has to do with the ability to escape a dangerous situation, and nothing to do with the rate per person. I worked in the hospitality industry for many years, in many different positions. You might be more concerned with number of guests if you're working in a seedier establishment. But it's not nearly as much of an issue when you're staying somewhere that's at least middle-of-the-line.", "I think we visit different hotels in different circumstances. Of course hotels and motels in which you can meet for sex exist. Yet that\u2019s not my cup of tea\u2026", "I haven\u2019t travelled a lot in the states but in Europe it most definitely isn\u2019t 50/50. You pay different prices for the same room based on occupancy.", "Where is that? I\u2019ve traveled all over the world and are truly unfamiliar with this concept. Single use of a double is usually cheaper and triple use of a double room is always more expensive. In my experience you pay hotels based on the number of guests registered. Just have a look at any hotel reservation website. Yet, maybe your country is the exception.", "I did when a good amount of the time when I had roommates because my TV was in my bedroom and the one in the living room was my roommates so if I wanted to watch something different than they did me and my friends had to go into my bedroom.", "No, she did not consent to putting on a show and the worker stayed in the room after knowing what was happening. Same thing Trump used to do to underage beauty pageant contestants.  \n\n\nShe was told to leave the room by the naked people in it and refused.", "Technically it falls under Sexual Violence \"Watching someone engage in private acts without their knowledge or permission\" per NSVRC", "In germany its allowed to have guests in your room, but they cant stay over night.\n\nWhen your guest wants to spent the night you have to inform the hotel. But thats because its the law, in this case Bundesmeldegesetz.", "Not \"as many as you like\", there's obviously max capacity for fire hazards. But it is generally up to 5 people per room. This thread is crazy.", "Uh, Motel 6, Red Roof Inn, La Quinta, the basic cheap hotels you stay in on road trips.", "The price does change buts not really per person it\u2019s like someone else explained there\u2019s a base rate for the room then certain charges on top per person. At big hotels things like resort fees and hospitality related charges are charged per occupant.", "I\u2019m not talking about motels. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever stayed in a motel. Are you seriously implying that people only have sex in motels? \n\nIm speaking about times I\u2019ve been staying at hotels for weddings or trips to Vegas or Denver with my single friends. \n\nJust because I\u2019ve had like 3 one night stands in hotels doesn\u2019t make me some trashy pay by the hour type person.", "The USA... and I did just confirm it online", "I\u2019ve never, ever seen a room charge more for more people. The room is the room. You check in and they ask how many keys you want. And they never stop you just walking into the hotel. You just walk in and head up to the room, no receptionist involved.", "The US doesn\u2019t charge for more people as long as you\u2019re under the occupancy limit.", "Yeah, guests aren't a problem.", "A quick look at the Motel 6 website states that they explicitly forbid occupying a double with more than two people and registration of all guests.", "I was talking about both hotels and motels as you can read. Of course hotels which look the other way for unregistered guests exist too. I didn\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s just not typically the kind of place I\u2019d feel comfortable, but you do you do. Absolutely not judging anyone for having one night stands. But these kind of hotels are just not for me.", "What country are you in? I\u2019m really surprised. I have some experience in the hotel branche and hotels are in a shit load of trouble if their traveler registration doesn\u2019t add up and they don\u2019t have all the paperwork in order. Also, the fire department will close your facilities if they find out capacity is maxed out. Maybe things aren\u2019t as strict where you are, but where I live hotel owners wouldn\u2019t take the risk of letting unregistered travelers overcrowd rooms.", "They do not enforce that shit at all, then.", "I\u2019m talking about hotels like the Bellagio and Mandalay bay in Vegas and Hilton and Marriott hotels in Seattle and Denver. Where they have conventions for lawyers, doctors and scientists. \n\nHonestly the more expensive the hotel the less likely they are to question their guests. \n\nNot to mention there is no way they can recognize the face of everyone who booked a room."]}
