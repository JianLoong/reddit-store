As long as you're not spoiling it for him ;)", "NTA.  This is weird.  If your father wanted you to not discuss the books with your stepbrother until he has read them too, that would have been fair.  But this is just strange.", "NTA.  This makes no sense.  Does your dad suffer from traumatic brain injury?  That's the only way I can see this making any kind of sense.  Ignore him.", "Spoil the dude", "NTA. Stepbrother needs to work harder if he wants to read the books more quickly. It's not fair to jold you back on his account", "\"No, I'm not particularly concerned about being fair to him.\"\n\nYou sound immature, and your attitude stinks. Your lack of concern for others isn't something to be proud of. It doesn't cost anything to be nice.\n\nYou could have compromised and told him, \"I'm going to read it, but I promise not to spoil it for him.\"\n\nGonna go against the grain and say YTA", "Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t spoil anything.", "Why should he be concerned? His dad picked up a new kid. That has nothing to do with OP.", "What's your argument here? That it's ok not to care but you shouldn't tell people you don't care?", "I'd be like, \"Look, just because you talked mom out of taking your sorry ass to court doesn't mean you can talk your way out of everything!\" What a deadbeat jackass.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re 16 and don\u2019t care about anyone else.  That\u2019s standard for that age.  As a 16yr old male, it\u2019s just standard to be dismissive.", "Sounds like a good way for step brother to improve his English (assuming he wants to): get an English-language copy of his favourite book in the series and suggest he reads it and the native-language copy side by side. (Not a quick fix, but it could help him to focus on discussing previous books, rather than fixating on the new one.)  \n\nI always wanted to do this with Italian, and thought of buying the Harry Potter books, but now that\u2019s off the table, I need to find an alternative.", "NTA. It's akin to: My parents don't allow me to stand while urinating because they see it as unfair to my sister.

Then it won't be an issue anymore.  In the meantime, you have books to read!", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.  There\u2019s no good reason you should have to wait on a book to be translated into a language your stepbrother can read before you read the book yourself.

I wouldn't care if this was your identical twin brother, it still wouldn't make the slightest sense for you to have to wait for a translation that you don't need. This is an absolutely ridiculous request that should be ignored, and it has nothing to do with \"fairness\" anyway. NTA.", "Well! Your dad sounds like a real winner! /s \n\nBut seriously- let's review:\n\n\\-Only sees his child \"once every couple of months.\"  \n\\-Doesn't pay child support.  \n\\-Discourages his child from reading and studying a foreign language.\n\nYou're NTA, and I wouldn't worry about a thing this fool says.", "NTA. Your dad ok?", "NTA with the caveat that you shouldn't be lording it over your brother or using it to taunt him. None of that \"Nanananana I know what happens and youuuu don't!\" childish nonsense. At 16 I would expect you are not doing this and your father has no reason to believe you would- but I felt it was necessary to say in case there IS some reason why it might cause problems in the home. Frankly, he shouldn't even be aware that you have read it until after he's read it if you aren't taunting him and aren't spoiling it, so I fail to see how he'd even know if you went ahead and read it. \n\nAlso- your father should be more concerned about the fact that his other son doesn't read English. As sad as it is, being able to read and write English will be an invaluable skill for almost anyone who speaks a different primary language and if anything, he might be trying to spare your brother feeling stupid for not knowing it. He should be concerned with uplifting your brother to where you are, not trying to drag you down instead.

Who clearly doesn't want to be a real part of your life.\n\nSounds like you hardly know your stepbrother. Who your dad clearly cares far more about than he cares about you.\n\nJust because your dad cares about him doesn't mean that you have any obligation to care for this person. Hell, you see your classmates more than you see this near stranger.\n\nI also wouldn't give a fuck about your dad being angry at you. What's he going to do? Cut off your child support? Oh wait. He doesn't pay any. How about not see you? He barely sees you anyway. Stop giving a fuck about you? Sorry, but it sounds like he doesn't give a fuck about you now. You're not a priority to him. He doesn't want to support you financially. (Though he supports stepbrother.) He barely wants to see you. (Though he sees stepbrother.)\n\nWhen you get married, don't even bother inviting him to the wedding.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your dad should encourage your SB to try reading in English, English is so useful!", "NTA, get an english to your native tongue dictionary.

Your dad is very AH for even requested this.", "Lol some guy who sees me once every few months wouldn\u2019t get to tell me what to do period.
