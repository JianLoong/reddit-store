We are exclusive but not serious, which we were both fine with. \n\nLast week I expressed my period was a few days late. He became anxious about an unplanned pregnancy. I tried to assure him thar was unlikely as my period has been irregular since I was 16 and began birth control (BC) and my cycle is easily thrown off by stress and my disordered eating (I have been experiencing extreme so stress and anxiety lately)I\u2019ve dealt with these issues for years and I know my body. \n\nA day or two later he insisted that I take a pregnancy test and I refused. He then insisted that I tell him when my last BC appointment was. I wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing that info with him either. I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because there was nothing to worry about. Also, I was venting  and sharing updates about a stressful situation that I\u2019m currently going through. I thought that was the end of it. \n\nAfter another day he \u201csuggested\u201d that I don\u2019t smoke or drink until he is sure I am not pregnant. Which I didn\u2019t agree to. My period came 2 days later and delivered the update. Thinking that would put this all to rest. \n\nBut the energy between us felt off still and he ended up telling me that he wanted to end things, because he didn\u2019t like how \u2018nonchalant and irresponsible\u201d I was and how he didn\u2019t think we were a good fit because we are so different. \n\nI thought I was just asserting my boundaries. He said that if I would have just taken the test days ago, then he wouldn\u2019t have been worried.

At least he\u2019s keeping up with your schedule, most don\u2019t care enough in the first place. getting ahead of it is one thing, but doubling down when he\u2019s clearly concerned is another.", "ESH\n\nHaving read your comments, he\u2019s being super creepy/controlling which makes him an AH and you dodged a bullet with him breaking things off.\n\nBUT\u2026 you\u2019re also an AH for \u201casserting your boundaries\u201d (your words) and refusing to pee on a stick. Yes, you \u201cknow your body\u201d, but there is the chance the your BC failed (as we all know\u2026 BC is not 100% effective). As a guy, if I found out or was told a girl I was recently intimate with was late, my mind would also jump to the possibility of her being pregnant\u2014and that\u2019s a big life change for both partners, regardless of whether you chose to continue the pregnancy or not.

NTA buy you would be TA to yourself if you stayed.", "NTA. Leave him behind. Imagine for one moment living with that year in, year out.\n\nSeems like a good idea to have a serious BC talk when you get exclusive with someone. If you two had that talk, you apparently left some useful info out.

I just wanted to say this: regardless, you dodged a bullet.", "Girl, take this as an easy exit!", "YTA. \n\nIf you had a quickie do you think you'd have the right to ask if he grabbed a condom? The answer is yes. \n\nBirthcontrol can fail, currently pregnant with birth control baby number three, you should have been testing even if you have erratic periods. You have no idea what month will be the one where your ovulation matches up with sex. \n\nYou were an asshole to him and yourself for what? \"Privacy\" reasons? The guy has literally been inside you and has every right to ask you those questions and to ask that you treat yourself right in the chance you're pregnant, especially when you won't take $7 and five minutes to take a test", "YTA.  Why bother telling him if your plan is to completely ignore his common sense questions.  He's just lucky you put that red flag out there for him to bail once it was a false alarm.", "NTA.

Why would you even bring up the possibility of being pregnant if you were going to refuse to a test? Why would you refuse to check for pregnancy but continue smoking and drinking?

If this guy hadn't been snooping and started following your cycles AFTER A MONTH,  you would never have had to tell him you were late. This guy is creepy and you're better off without him", "So you have been dating a month and you say he tracks your cycle? It just doesn't add up! If we leave out the part about him supposedly tracking your period, then YTA!", "E S H. My partner of 12 years still doesn't know my cycle. After a month, that is beyond creepy. Also, why not just take the test to be sure? Not like it's difficult.\n\nEdit to change verdict: NTA.", "YTA - in what world is dating someone for a month, who tracks your period cycle normal?\n\nUnless he was trying to get you pregnant?", "I think you're NTA for not talking to him about your bc appointment. As you say you aren't serious, so it's none of his business.\n\nI do think YTA for telling him about having a late period and then refusing to do a pregnancy test though. Just...why? What do you have to lose here? Is this about the couple of bucks for the test that you didn't want to pay? I just don't understand your reasoning here.\n\nThe fact that he broke up with you over this is borderline insane. He wanted to have that baby, which is weird considering that you're not serious? I don't know, I think you dodged a major bullet here.\n\nSo all in all I think ESH for the reasons I stated.", "YTA, HTA, and ESH.", "NAH\n\nHe\u2019s entitled to set his boundary too, he respected yours and saw it brought him worry and anxiety. It\u2019s fair to say he wouldn\u2019t be able to cope like that. He clearly does not want to ask you to change and that\u2019s absolutely fair and mature.\n\nThat said, a pregnancy test in the first two weeks would be a miss. Been there and have the baby to prove it, sucks when you did the test and already said it\u2019s negative. Btw baby is ok even after smoking the first month not knowing. You could\u2019ve researched with him to confirm what you\u2019re telling him - men don\u2019t know the details.", "You obviously haven't dated a woman.

No, I won\u2019t give you any more info about anything\n\nI'm not sure if you have trouble with reading and understanding text, but the entire point of the post is that OP knew she wasn't pregnant, because has an established pattern of irregular cycles. Which her boyfriend also kniws, because she gave him that information in detail. \n\nGiven that, I cannot imagine why you would want to depict her actions as \"I think I might be pregnant and I won't give you any more info\". Your comment is so pointlessly angry.\n\nIncidentally, the most common cause of irregular periods is metabolic disorders like PCOS, which often makes conception harder than usual.", "The exit has been taken", "Well seeing as how I track periods, sex and ovulation and he obviously knows this.

And tbh i couldn\u2019t tell exactly how he felt myself just hoping for someone that shares his views could clarify. I never asked if or invite him to track my period which cause anxiety for me. I can get that telling him i was late was a bad idea. I just knew he would bring it up first and was trying to get in front of it.", "There are few comments for me as well others providing some clarification for the questions proposed here.", "I use it mainly to ballpark so it\u2019s not just coming out of the blue. I\u2019ve been using it for like 2 years so it\u2019s usually only a day or off most of the time which is helping for me personally. I only addressed the situation so he wouldn\u2019t. Which i can see wasn\u2019t the best idea.", "I mean if it were like a week or something outside of the normal variation of my irregular cycle, sure. But if i took i took a test every time my cycle varied. That would be a big waste of time plus getting myself worked up for no reason time and time again as has happened in the past. Nobody wants to have a pregnancy scare every month. Hence me sharing that my cycle is irregular.", "I think it\u2019s for me it more about the fact that like he already over stepped in trying to track my cycle. And i felt like i already took a loss and there\u2019s no way i could that the info the snooped for away as he already knew it. I was clinging on to the only info i had left for my body about my body to myself. May not make it right but there\u2019s your explanation.", "But that would still only make this her second one. It's still weird that he'd be tracking her cycle at all, but after only 1?", "The point is he didn\u2019t know all that context and he wasn\u2019t being an AH.", "The dude only saw you as a potential incubator. Do take care of yourself, and next time a guy tells you he wants babies NOW, you run. He barely knows you and wants to be tied to you for the next 18 years?

He could have some sort of a breeding fetish. Either way, it\u2019s a good thing this relationship is over.", "Seconded. Many of the behaviors OP described are disconcerting. He's laying the groundwork to make you question your judgement and trust only his. It's the behavior of someone manipulative and toxic.

After one month of dating? I agree. Creepy af.", "It's totally bonkers though, that's what people are having issue with. The fact that this guy is blatantly trying to babytrap you, and your response is basically, \"Cool, that makes sense.\"\n\nNot saying you're lying, just that...

It just feels horrible to be called a liar ig.", "You're not a liar.
