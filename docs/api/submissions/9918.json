We are exclusive but not serious, which we were both fine with. \n\nLast week I expressed my period was a few days late. He became anxious about an unplanned pregnancy. I tried to assure him thar was unlikely as my period has been irregular since I was 16 and began birth control (BC) and my cycle is easily thrown off by stress and my disordered eating (I have been experiencing extreme so stress and anxiety lately)I\u2019ve dealt with these issues for years and I know my body. \n\nA day or two later he insisted that I take a pregnancy test and I refused. He then insisted that I tell him when my last BC appointment was. I wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing that info with him either. I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, because there was nothing to worry about. Also, I was venting  and sharing updates about a stressful situation that I\u2019m currently going through. I thought that was the end of it. \n\nAfter another day he \u201csuggested\u201d that I don\u2019t smoke or drink until he is sure I am not pregnant. Which I didn\u2019t agree to. My period came 2 days later and delivered the update. Thinking that would put this all to rest. \n\nBut the energy between us felt off still and he ended up telling me that he wanted to end things, because he didn\u2019t like how \u2018nonchalant and irresponsible\u201d I was and how he didn\u2019t think we were a good fit because we are so different. \n\nI thought I was just asserting my boundaries. He said that if I would have just taken the test days ago, then he wouldn\u2019t have been worried.
