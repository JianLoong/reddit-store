Anything can happen and you need your partners support.", "INFO - Where do you live? New Zealand? UK? USA?", "YTA. You have a support system in place. You'll be a month away from birth. He misses his family and will only be gone a week.\n\nYou're about to give birth to your first child. Honestly, what do you think he's going to miss with the pregnancy by going? And when do you really think he'll have this opportunity again? I promise you're not taking a newborn or toddler from NYC to Australia if you don't have to. \n\nI understand this is your firstborn and everything seems like a big deal, but I think you need a little perspective. Let the man go. Your relationship and family will be better for it.", "Info: where do you live?", "YTA - even the title is a little dismissive. \n\nYes. If he would see his family every day, he might be an asshole to go to a destination wedding of his cousin. But it is about seeing his family (mother and dad). He has probably not seen them for 3 years? \n\nIs there any moment in time you are willing to compromise that he is going to see his parents?", "It's a soft YTA for me. I get it, you will be 7.5 months pregnant when he leaves but this could literally be the only time he sees his family for several years. Once that baby is born, it may not be financially feasible for either of you to take a trip to Australia.", "NAH - BUT I would really strongly encourage him to wear an n95 mask on the flight both ways whenever possible (80+ percent of wastewater testing on planes landing in NY show evidence of covid) and consider wearing a mask most of the time he is at the wedding if there aren't any precautions.  Any illness is dangerous to newborns and covid infection can result in preterm labor\n\n[https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/08/421181/covid-19-during-pregnancy-associated-preterm-birth](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/08/421181/covid-19-during-pregnancy-associated-preterm-birth)\n\nSo if he is traveling, he should be careful, and he should probably consider isolating for a few days when he gets back to make sure he isn't going to put you and the baby at risk.

It's your first pregnancy I assume. It's a really scary time. As much as people act like being pregnant is easy, it isn't! I was in and out the hospital from 30 weeks due to reduced movements, I had to watch my blood pressure and not get stressed etc. \nIt's a huge drama for your body to go through, and you want your partner there! \n\nMy midwife made it extremely clear to my partner that the last month was THE most important for a good labour, nesting, saftey, love, care etc. Being helped to the loo at 3am , making sure you're not stuck in the bath etc! \n\nIf he still chooses to go that's up to him, I get he doesn't want to miss his family and their wedding, but it's not your fault your dates clash! I guess the question is if anything happened, early labour etc could he forgive himself for not being there, or cohld you forgive him.", "NTA, does he want to be there for the birth of his kid? When your baby is delivered I imagine his family will come visit.", "NAH. I would certainly want my partner to stay close, but it seems like the likelihood of something dramatic happening while he is gone is low, and he could get on a flight back to you if something unexpected did occur. That said, frankly a cousin's wedding just doesn't seem to me like a critical reason for him to leave you at that point. If he wishes to see his family, it would make sense for him to go NOW, or as soon as possible, so that it's earlier in your pregnancy (and also not after the baby arrives). I realize that would not be the right timing for the wedding but he could do a pre-wedding round of visits and give his well wishes to the couple.", "NTA. I know it sucks to miss a big family moment but HIS family moment is with you. You could go into early labor and he would miss the birth of his child. Many doctors would NEVER advise you to get on a flight to Australia this pregnant. Zac needs to recheck his priorities.", "So my husband was invited to go on a hunting trip out of state when I was 33-34 weeks with our second baby.  He really wanted to go, so I told him he should.  He ultimately declined the invitation because he didn\u2019t want to be away from me, just in case.  I really appreciated his choice.  \n\nI\u2019m going to say NAH because I understand your concerns.  I also understand why he would want to attend a family wedding.  Sometimes you can only let your concerns be known and hope he\u2019ll make a good decision.  Good luck OP!", "NTA he shouldn't want to be away from you when you're so vulnerable right now. I'm sorry that he cares about a wedding more than his pregnant wife.", "YTA - Unless you mentally and physically are incapable of caring for yourself, let him go visit his family. Once the child is born travel typically goes to the back burner that first year.", "YTA - don't use your condition as an excuse to control someone.  You were invited with, don't want to go, and its not like you're due while he's gone, or very close to it.", "Unless you are high risk, YTA. Pregnancy averages 40 weeks, and often first time moms go past 40 weeks. So it\u2019s likely you will have 8 or more weeks until baby is born. People always say 9 months but it\u2019s really closer to 10 months. So saying 8 months makes it seem close than it actually is. \nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to sit on a beach and drink all day. He\u2019s going for a wedding, hopefully a once in his cousins lifetime event.", "NTA - If you're upset at him now, how does he think you will be if you have the baby while he is gone? It's a risk he is willing to take. Just remember to only give as good as you get. Going forward don't ever do something solely because he asks. Only do the things you genuinely want to do. He is selfish and that isn't going to change.", "NTA. Wanting your partner by your side when you give birth is normal, and by going to the wedding he could miss it, and there are no do over. \n\nThe fact is most companies do not allow women in their last trimester to fly because they could go into labour at any time.", "Unless you\u2019re high risk YTA. You are not alone and a solid month away.", "Well, what does your doctor think? Is the pregnancy proceeding without complications or are you at some kind of risk?\n\nIf you aren\u2019t having complications, (and god knows there are a lot of things that *could* go wrong)\u2026 If you are getting along without things that must be monitored closely by your doctor and might require an unexpected trip to the emergency room in the middle of the night, then let the man leave for a few days.

You are dooming your relationship by this action alone.\n\nAll disagreements are you+him vs The Problem.  The Problem here are the competing needs of family loyalty versus your fear of being alone and what could go wrong while you have no help from him.\n\nYou approach this by being a team.  Looking at ways you can narrow the risk so that he can go without you being at risk.  \n\nRealistically unless you\u2019re a high risk pregnancy, you\u2019re not at risk of going into labour, but what are the other concerns and risk that the two of you together can make contingency plans for  or set in place strategies to reduce the risks.\n\nIn a happy and long term supportive partnership, you each compromise what you want sometimes.

I get wanting to have him there for support. But other than that, what can he do? You have others around you to give you support. Yes, the baby might come early, it happens. But it probably won't. You'll be fine, he'll be fine, the baby will be fine. Unless your doctor has told you that you have a high risk pregnancy, which you did not mention, it's only a week. If you can't handle a week without Zac, then I hate to see what happens when he has to leave you on business or some other reason after you have the baby.

Can he cut the trip shorter? \n\nI think there\u2019s a possibility he\u2019ll resent you if you make him stay and nothing happens. \n\nI think there\u2019s a strong possibility that you\u2019ll resent him if he does and something doesn\u2019t or does happen. \n\nI guess to me this depends on how accommodating he usually is. If it wasn\u2019t for the pre booked relatives wedding do you know he\u2019d 100% be there? If this a pattern fine hold your ground. If not? It\u2019s up to you I guess\u2026", "Yta.

Pregnancy can be an emotionally and physically challenging time, and it's natural to want your partner by your side. However, it's important to consider your boyfriend's perspective as well. This may be an important family event for him and an opportunity for him to see his family, whom he hasn't seen in a while.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and your need for support during your pregnancy.

As a mother, I don't think this is likely. Unless you are high risk, let him go.  Go stay with some family during that week.

He's responsible for her \"condition.\"", "Your relationships must be disastrous \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Flip side how pissed would he be missing the wedding? I feel like these two if they hold this against each other this isn't going to work out. They arent married and he could technically just leave", "Telling someone to be petty in her relationship for the rest of her life because they are having a problem over this one decision is horrible relationship advice.", "She will only be 32 weeks pregnant when he is gone..  chances of her giving birth that early are very very slim. he wants to see his family and trust me, it\u2019s easier to travel to Australia without a baby. No reason he can\u2019t swing this unless she is high risk and if she was, that would be in the post.", "Then you should vote NAH.", "I'll be 32 weeks when he's planning to go", "OP commented she would only be 32 weeks when he goes.. that\u2019s possibly 10 weeks before she could possibly give birth", "Right? I didn\u2019t have my son until 41 weeks. I know babies come when they come, but idk why she \u201cneeds\u201d him with her at that time.", "Pregnancy is an extremely difficult time. Especially the third trimester close to the delivery date. \n\nIsn't it only fair to want your partner there?", "Unless the baby comes really early there is absolutely no way he would miss the birth with the given timeline.  You say Australia will still be there?  Sure it will but how often do you think he will be able to go to Australia once there child is born?  They sure as hell aren't going to fly their kid to Australia from NYC for at least a couple of years so this is the last chance he can see his family for a long time, and OP wants him to skip it due to her paranoia.", "His cousin\u2019s wedding is likely a once in a lifetime event. And he hasn\u2019t seen his family for over 3 years because of this little thing called a pandemic. \n\nAnd once the baby is here she isn\u2019t going to let him go visit his family for a week with the way she feels. So when will he get a chance to see his family? You\u2019re talking about Australia like it\u2019s a vacation. To him that home and family.", "This should be at the top.", "Exactly", "He's not going to miss that part.", "Weak logic. What if they\u2019re planning on more kids? Then there will be more births too.", ">NTA but neither is he\n\nyou're looking for NAH", "Has anyone noticed the entitled behavior of pregnant women lately? They act like it's a disability or something.", "As someone talking about adopted or biological children with my boyfriend\u2026 I would dump him immediately if that was his attitude.\n\nChildren are a huge commitment. You have to miss out on things sometimes. Your first priority is them and their safety. \n\nPremature labor happens and when it does it\u2019s traumatic. She could be in a position where she has to make crazy medical decisions and the father isn\u2019t there. Ask me because my mother had multiple traumatic births and my dad was at every single one and it was his highest priority when my mom was pregnant.", "Yeah I think she will tie him down by that point when he wouldn't have a chance to leave after the baby is born. Going now would work out for both of them", "She\u2019s said 8 weeks from delivery", "When? I'm positive OP would not want him to go away for a week after the baby is born. She couldn't go with him for quite a few months - it's not a good idea to fly with an infant until they are around 4-6 months old, and even then I couldn't imagine it. So a \"little later\" would practically be six months at least, possibly longer.\n\nHe doesn't get home often to see his family, and he's not going to get home anytime soon after the baby is born. If he wants to visit family, this is really about the best time they are going to have.", "She has family all around her and she will be 8 months so she is potential risk not high risk yet till she is close to 9 months", "8 weeks out, not four", "Hear me out, by the time she is 8 months, it\u2019s entirely possible for the baby to decide \u201chey, im gonna come out now if thats ok\u201d. Its also pretty common for babies to be born prematurely and the mother not be able to get to a hospital in time without someone within 2 mins of walking being there", ">He asked me to go to the wedding with him, but I said no because I don't want to travel that far.\n\nYeah, but she probably won't be able to either way, which was my point.", "A week but with the travel time it's more like 8-9 days", "She mentioned he\u2019ll be away for a week", "That was a pretty big detail that was missing. Like if you both lived in NZ, I would definitely have said that you are overreacting. New York is a bit far.", "What are you so worried about", "Being 8 months pregnant can also be miserable and her partner going literally across the world means she's got reduced (or no) support. It's a dick move.", "Are you seriously comparing missing the birth of a child or not being there for your partner having a late term miscarriage, to missing a wedding? Wow.", "I don't think it's petty to look out for yourself if your partner is only going to look out for themselves.", "That\u2019s it. If it was the week she was due, I\u2019d totally agree with her .. but a month out\u2026 and he\u2019s only going for a week\u2026.", "Which is generally 8 weeks away from full term.  \nIs this a high risk pregnancy?", "You will still have 8 weeks to go. Let him go.", "So.. 6 weeks before the pregnancy would be considered full term. 5 weeks when he gets home. You're more than a month away by the time he gets home. YTA.", "Yeah that\u2019s true too", "Ok OP YTA", "And my brother was born a month early. If this is her first kid, it's understandable why she wouldn't want her husband to be gone during that last month just in case. But, I personally think it's NAH with this one.", "Yeah I\u2019m not ready to call her an asshole but unless he\u2019s going for 2 weeks + she should be okay", "My sister wasn\u2019t high risk and abruptly had her baby at only 31 weeks.  Her husband was traveling for work and wasn\u2019t there.  It can and does happen.", "She would only be 32 weeks when he was gone, and no more than 34 weeks when he returns.. the chances of him being gone when she does into labor are extremely slim.", "I get that that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to call her an asshole.  But a pre booked trip a month + before delivering\u2026like is he allowed to leave her if he stays home?", "They\u2019re logic also suggests that the cousin will have more than one wedding. Maybe that specific cousin is important to him.", "Maybe, but you can only witness the birth of your first child once", "I was gonna say, didn't we have this yesterday, but the boyfriend was going to a funeral? My vote here is YTA. Interesting how many N T A there are today when person yesterday & pregnant sister got ripped to shreds.", "Yep. Mom of 2 here, and I actually feel insulted by the amount of posts that make us seem like weak invalids who can\u2019t do anything remotely hard on our own when we\u2019re pregnant.", "Pregnancy may feel way worse than many disabilities. So do not mock the pregnant women who are making the next generation that will provide for your retirement and will clean your bedridden ass, if needed.", "Ummm\u2026. Pregnancy changes your whole body. It can be life threatening. Let me guess you\u2019re a guy.", "I'm sure plenty of people would dump you over your attitude too.", "Then you would do your boyfriend a favor in helping him dodge a major bullet", "32 weeks divided by four is eight months.", "Still at worst 8+2 he\u2019ll be back", "So are you more okay with him going back to visits his family after you give birth? When?", "My sister went into preterm labor and her husband was a few states away.  He couldn\u2019t get flights right away and missed the birth.  He couldn\u2019t help her after a very traumatic c section.  He didn\u2019t arrive until a day later and it really impacted their relationship.", "Her family and friends are around. I gave birth to twins while my husband was on deployment and had NO family around where we were stationed at. My mom didn\u2019t make it in time to be with me. Being pregnant isn\u2019t comfortable, you are right. \nBut him seeing all of his family in 1 place before a baby comes into the world and he won\u2019t be back in Australia anytime soon, is absolutely doable in this scenario. \n\nBut she will still be potentially 10 weeks from giving birth when the boyfriend is in Australia.", "Missing the only chance he has to see his whole family he has had for years and for years to come.  The chances of him actually missing the birth are minimal.", "I'm saying people will get the shits if they don't get their way and I see both these two will get the shits at each other is what I'm saying so no matter what happens they will both be shitty for one not getting their way. You follow?", "I get that and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t call her an asshole", "Exactly. And it's closer to two months to delivery not one. Standard pregnancy is 40 weeks. \n\nI don't think she's an asshole for being nervous but he's not an asshole for wanting to go given the circumstances and when she's not exactly on the verge of popping.", "No. I\u2019m a mother to five children.", "Fuck off.", "Full pregnancy is 40 weeks", "Gestation is 40 weeks. 36 weeks/9 months is not term.", "So, with your math, 32 weeks is eight months. 36 weeks is 9 months. 40 weeks is 10 months. So you're saying that a pregnancy is roughly 10 months, instead of the 9 it actually is. The issue is that a month isn't 4 weeks (except February), it's 4.3 weeks. She won't be 8 months pregnant - she won't even be 7.5 months pregnant. \n\n38 weeks or more is considered full term. So by the time he gets back, she'll still be \\~5 weeks (over a month!) from that.", "Unfortunately not every month is 28 days", "I'm guessing you'd give the argument that all 5 pregnancies of said children were bliss, easy, and not at all completely altering of your body? Not all pregnant women are entitled. Especially in the last 2 months. Baffling that another woman, one who even has kids, said that."]}
