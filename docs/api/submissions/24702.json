Honestly fuck her. Yeah maybe you could have taken the high road but this woman sounds intolerable. \n\nThe fact that she went on a FAMILY vacation with her presumably fairly old parents and her nieces/nephews and thought the trip could revolve around adult activities that really only she enjoys is beyond me. If she had something more interesting than just going to a bar in mind and was more fun herself then yeah maybe get the grandparents to watch the kids 1 or 2 nights do something adult. But if you go on a family vacation with older people and children you should expect the majority of activities to revolve around things everyone can participate in.", "NTA\n\nShe's a grown woman whining that you won't play with her? If she can't entertain herself, that's her problem. Give her a colouring book next time.", "Only apologise if you think she will also apologise so you can calm things down and salvage the rest of the holiday. \n\nSeems like sister had unrealistic expectations regarding this holiday. As soon as kids are involved, either the childless adults chose to find something to do when the parents are.. parenting, or they join in the family fun. \n\nYour sister assumed you would drop the kids and be HER playmates for this holiday. That\u2019s not how it works and she should\u2019ve realised this.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NTA. Your sister sounds like a childish pain in the ass.\n\nLook, I\u2019m child free and don\u2019t enjoy hanging out with kids, but that\u2019s why I would think ahead and either decide I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy the vacation and not go, or go with the expectation that it would be kid/young family oriented and understand that the adults would be compromising a lot.\n\nIf she wants to go out at night, she\u2019s welcome to take a book or her phone to the bar and sip a glass of wine or cocktail. She doesn\u2019t need to be dependent on you to get out. If she\u2019s such an adult, she can be resourceful and figure out how to entertain herself. Sulking around for days and the. insulting your kids is really unnecessary and I think she got what was coming to her.", "Info - how old is everyone?  Including your children?", "As someone who understands the zero to 60 metaphor, I am leaning toward NTA. \n\nI'm with your dad. \n\nShe sounds like a lonely and bitter person.", "NAH\n\nOriginally I was going to say Nta but honestly I kind of feel a little bit of pity for your sister. From her perspective and maybe I'm assuming to much, shes been invited on a holiday with the family. It sounds to me like she is the one left out on the trip. Is there anyone else around her age also in your family who doesn't have a SO or kids. \n\nI don't think you owe her an apology but perhaps you can be the bigger person and recognise that this trip just isn't tailored for her and just do it anyway.\n\nYour sister does have a point as well. 2 hours at a bar isn't exactly a lot of adult time.", "I could definitely be angry with my sister if she call my children annoying because we didn't want to party. we wanted to be adults and spend time with Family in a family vacation . This is not a trip to Las Vegas. Your sister was the AH in this situation.", "NTA, and don't apologize. Your mother is full of it. Mothers in these stories always side with the aggressor.\n\nAnd your sister is impossible. Why do you spend time with her? Just because you're related?", "NTA - your mom wasn't there, so she's being fed information from both sides and making a judgement call to \"keep the peace\" (which is IMO, the wrong one...) but your husband WAS there where she called your kids, his own kids, \"annoying\"?? And he says you snapped?  Hell no.  Does he not have a spine or any respect for his own kids?  Your sis sounds insufferable... disrespecting your kids to your face...", "Definitely NTA. First when I was reading I thought she was a teenager, then drinking came up and I switched to YA, 21 and really immature maybe - not that it would be a valid excuse. but being 36 and calling your sister's children names to her face? That's way beyound any normal polite behaviour. She acted like she has no respect for you, your family and your wishes, i,e, like an asshole and owns you an apology.", "I just see a sister who is bitter and shouldn\u2019t be catered to at all when being inappropriate. If you went from zero to 60 it was just to catch up with your sister and pass by her for the win. NTA.", "NTA, you can apologize for snapping (if you really want to, I don't think its a big deal), but its ultimately her fault for expecting two parents with young kids to be able to do soley adult things. She might just miss her sister and not know what its like to always take care of kids.

It\u2019s not unreasonable for your sister to have anticipated doing some activities on the boat with you.  But you saw things as waste of money or not your style, preferring to hang around the pool and buffet, and acting like you did a great favour by going to bar one night at 7.

There would be a difference between \"I'd like to spend a little time with just you on our vacation, is there something you'd like to do?\" and just suggesting a bunch of stuff that would constantly exclude your kids (and probably your spouse and/or parents).

She def could have just did things herself. There are plenty of groups and singles on cruises you can chat up.", "Right? My (childfree) spouse and I would probably at MOST hang out for a couple of hours, long enough to have a beer or two and then be done.

Wine tastings are such a waste of money, and I only like white wine anyway. Bingo is also a waste of money, and I don't understand the entertainment value. I went to one trivia with her, but I just really enjoyed the pool and buffet a lot more. That one trivia was fun, but I didn't want to do it every day.

Time to move on. Plus she missed opportunities to meet other singles. And just have fun.", "It was a cruise, yes.", "Yeah, she needed to be an adult and find something she wanted to do and just do it.
