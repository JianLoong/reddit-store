If she had something more interesting than just going to a bar in mind and was more fun herself then yeah maybe get the grandparents to watch the kids 1 or 2 nights do something adult.

If she can't entertain herself, that's her problem. Give her a colouring book next time.\n\nEdit: I came back and read some comments ... I do not get some redditors. This is a 36yo woman throwing a tantrum, and most people are attacking OOP for not prioritising her. Who cares if OOP's oldest child is 16? Why does that mean she should schedule her holiday around her sister who throws insults at her kids? If I went on a family holiday and my brother spent his time and attention on his children? Good!

She doesn\u2019t need to be dependent on you to get out. If she\u2019s such an adult, she can be resourceful and figure out how to entertain herself.

OP is clearly someone who enjoys spending time with her kids. I feel like it's safe to think someone like that would also feel that way on a vacation, and ideally, her sister would know that about her. \n\nMy mom was the same way. She was very kid-oriented when she went on vacations with us, and everyone who knew her knew that. No one would have been surprised if they heard that she went on a cruise and engaged in activities with us instead of leaving us in daycare.

We have a pretty great relationship and frankly, I just can\u2019t imagine writing about her with the kind of very poorly concealed resentment that you do your sibling. Seems obvious to me based on your writing here that you look down on your sister. She shouldn\u2019t have called your kids annoying, but I can see why she would\u2019ve felt left out on this trip.

However, if OP cannot make time for all of her relationships, she is at least partially in the wrong here. Then it would be e.s.h. If someone has kids and is entirely unwilling to do anything without them anymore or engage in other things, people are allowed to be upset with that relationship neglect.\n\nEdit: and finding time for relationships and activities that don\u2019t always include your kids is not equivalent to not liking spending time with your kids. I like spending time with my nieces and nephews, and if my siblings never made time for me without them they would be a bad friend, not super mom.

If one of my friends and I grow apart, we will gradually exit each other's lives, but I will always be there for my sister. If she needs money, I will send it without question. A ride? I'll drive four hours to get her and four hours back without delay. Nothing will change that, no matter how often she annoys me. Which is very often.", ">However, if OP cannot make time for all of her relationships, she is at least partially in the wrong here.\n\nWe have no idea how OP maintains her relationships outside of this vacation. And she's not obligated to do an activity she's not interested in just bc they're on vacation. \n\nBased on the way the vacation was set up, there were group activities they all agreed on, and then they were all free to do their own things the rest of the time, so it's not like OP wasn't spending time with the others. It makes a lot of sense for her, as a parent, to prioritize her kids.  I can understand the sister wanting one on one time with OP, but you usually don't go on a group vacation with kids expecting that; what you do is set up an outing just between the two of you.", "Yeah, that's super.

Well that\u2019s pretty reasonable tbh.\n\nEh, to me it being reasonable depends on how likely the sister thought OP planned on leaving her kids with someone else. As mentioned before, just bc there are childcare services available doesn't mean they're absolutely going to be taken. \n\nBut okay, let's say this is what the sister assumed. Isn't it on her for assuming that instead of actually communicating with OP and makimg a plan before the vacation to take part in certain activities? Isn't it on her for assuming OP would be willing to go to the bar every night (which can be a lot even for adults who aren't parents)? \n\nIf she wanted to spend time with OP this vacation outside of the group activities, why didn't she tell that to OP before the trip? She could have gone up to OP and said, \"Hey, I was thinking of doing so-and-so, would you be interested in joining me?\" And then she and OP could have adjusted their plans to accomodate for that better.  Instead, she waited last minute when OP had already made plans, and didn't have a lot of time to find activities they might both like.", "It sounds like your sister desperately wanted to spend time with you without your kids (and probably without your husband), but you couldn't do that once. You could have left them with their father for an hour or two while you and your sister got lunch or went to the adults-only pool or whatever this ship had, but no, you couldn't even give her that. \n\nI get it that you're a mum and a wife, and your husband and kids are everything to you, and that's great (and perfectly normal), but it sounds like your sister misses spending time with you. She shouldn't have snapped at you, nor you back at her, but I think she felt sad and lonely and abandoned by her sister, so in the moment she blamed the \"interlopers,\" aka your children, for taking all of your attention. \n\nIs that fair and rational? No, not at all, but family isn't always fair and rational, and she was hurting. I can be a perfectly rational, responsible adult in my everyday life, but put me with my sister, and we're right back in our school days.

Sometimes the need for mental stimulation is real.", "YTA. You guys all went away together, you paint your sister like she was hogging you the whole time, just wanting to do adult activities.

Yeah I'd be annoyed too that I'd wasted my money on that trip if I were your sister.

I'd be disappointed too if I tried to have fun with my sibling on a vacation and the one night they gave was over at 9pm. \n\nIt also sounds like you decided you were already sick of her on the vacation from the moment it was planned, long before it actually began. How dare she get excited about the prospect of a fun vacation. Was there ever a chance of you actually having fun with your sister, or where you already pissed at her before the trip even started? Because the story you told sounds like you were already over her before the whole thing began. \n\nHonestly, it seemed like she was trying to have fun, and you honestly sound like you were determined not to have any fun with her. \n\nWhat were the family excursions? Were they something that only someone under 12 or over 60 would like? Why are you so insulted she didn't join you and decided to have fun on her own? \n\nAlso, ignore her or not, she'll get over it.

It\u2019s just a waste of money\u201d however when you twist the situation. \u201cHow dare she not be happy about kayaking with my kids!\u201d \u201cHow dare she not want to come for activities we planned for her\u201d proceeds to reject or ignored every invite her sister extended to her.", "Yeah, I mean... how hard is it to just say \"I would like us to spend some one-on-one time together, since we haven't done that much lately\"? Talk about it like mature, rational adults, and work together to hash out a plan.", "Right? It seemed pretty conditional to me too.", "I wonder... are you getting downvoted or is reality getting downvoted?\n\nYou're exactly right - if we don't put time into people, you can't expect people to put time into you. Long term friends (and family) will wait a long time, but their lives won't stop for kids. By the time we have time, they're a different person and we're no longer their priority. That's not AH behaviour, it's just life.\n\nFinal thought, if Sis is the youngest sibling, it may be the first time she's been through this cycle, so her outburst is probably form a genuine place of hurt and lack of understanding rather than entitlement."]}
