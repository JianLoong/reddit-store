The car passes though other 2 cities, one of which does not provide their students from said school with transportation or financial support. So a couple of guys from there catch a ride with us daily. They enter the car at 6:00am or 6:10am.\n\nThe problem is, they are very loud. As soon as they enter the car, I, and the other people there, cannot sleep anymore. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to create a problem or something. But last Thursday, when I got in the car, at 12:30am, when it's the time to go back, they were playing really loud music.\n\nI snapped and said that they should turn off their music because I wanted to rest and whenever they are in the car I'm unable to do so. So one of them said: \"Are we bothering you?\", to which I answered: \"Yes, you are\"\n\nAnd then, they stormed off the car. And refused a ride back to their city, despite the other car that also goes through their city, that could give them a ride, having already left.\n\nThe people in my car said I shouldn't have asked them to turn off their music and that by doing this I hurt their ego and owned them an apology, and that I should also be understanding of the fact that they are boys and have a lot of energy.\n\nAlso, yes, other people have complained about their noise, but everyone seemed to do so before they got in, or at school, after we left the car. There are other seven people in the car, out of which two said that what I did (asking them to turn off their music) wasn't right. The others, stayed silent.\n\nThey weren't playing music on their phones, if you are wondering. They brought a boombox speaker to the car. And the car isn't very big, it's a Sprinter van (search it on google if you want) so I would have to listen to it no matter where I sat.\n\nWas it wrong of me for asking them to turn off their music and say that they were bothering me?", "created_utc": 1667142149, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhgfxo/aita_for_asking_some_guys_on_my_car_to_turn_off/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you're ride-sharing (no matter the mode of transport), it is considered polite to listen to your phone calls, music or media with earbuds or headphones.  Not everyone needs to know what's going on with you or your friend/family member who is calling.  Everyone has different tastes in music/media as well.
