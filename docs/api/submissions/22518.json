She only wanted it back whenever it was convenient for her. It feels really icky for her to walk into my home and demand it back.

You own it and have proof you\u2019ve owned it for many years. If she wants it, she can take you to small claims court. Do not give it back. Even if she wants to trade\u2026 make sure you see it before trading.  Plus, if the picture has been in your home for so long, I\u2019m sure you decorate with this price of art in mind. Your sister is TAH.", "I think YTA if you don't give it back. It has her name on it, and more importantly, your grandfather made it For Her. She is the one he wanted to have it, it belongs with her. \n\nI just don't understand how you've had this painting that you \"cherished\" for 14 years and you never once noticed it had your sister's name on it? You never examined it, or asked your family if they knew when or why your grandfather made it?\n\nI'm also Fascinated by that little implication in your post that your sister intentionally donated your grandfather's belongings, without giving you a chance to go through them?", "It\u2019s yours, regardless of what it says on tiny letters on the bottom. NTA", "Well, are you willing to accept the consequences of not handing over the painting?", "YTA.  You enjoyed it for 14 years, and now your sister is moving to a house where she can now appreciate and enjoy it, and by all accounts, it\u2019s hers.  Get something new, and let your sister have it back and be grateful that you were able to keep it and use it for 14 years.", "\u201cHappy Birthday Sisters Name\u201d?  YTA dude. When people are younger, they don\u2019t realize how important their past relationships are to who they are now and how they became that person. Your sister is growing up and has learned to appreciate the people from her childhood. That\u2019s normal. Give it back.", "YTA - do what you will,  but your grandfather made it for her. You\u2019re cherishing something he made for her, as though it some how had a special meaning to you, when the entire intention was for it to be for her. You sound like you want to benefit from this. \n\nI hate it when people say \u201cthey donated everything to goodwill with no consideration to me\u201d. Where were you when they were cleaning everything out? Didn\u2019t you think to go help? This essentially happens after every death, and if you\u2019re in contact with family, they usually talk about it.  It\u2019s not really a one day thing since there\u2019s lawyers and wills etc.\n\nI\u2019ve done this many times, no one shows up to help but then are angry you didn\u2019t hold onto things for them when they didn\u2019t show up. Like we can\u2019t keep everything forever! Nor is it our unpaid job to go through everything asking if someone wants it so they can show up  for one item and neglect the rest of the work just to grab what they selfishly want and leave. Clearing out an estate is hard work. And asking someone to put aside a bunch of things they may or may not want is just asking them to do even more work. And it\u2019s very emotional work too. \n\nI kinda think you come across as entitled and do what you will, since the painting is yours now since you took it. But you make it sound like she just wants it now because it\u2019s convenient for her, because that fits your narrative. But to me,  it sounds like grandpa died and your sister didn\u2019t think much of the painting when he was alive, since she had him, but now that he\u2019s gone she misses him and it reminds her of him and the bond they had.", "NTA\n\nIt belongs to you and she is 14 years too late", "YTA....give it back. She let you borrow it for 14 years because she didn't have the wall space to do it justice. You have the same grandfather and it sounds like she has a sentimental value for it as well.", "YTA.  It belongs to her.  She let you enjoy it for 14 years.  Now she wants something that belongs to her back.  I really don\u2019t see how this is hard to understand.", "If it was a gift created for your sister, YTA, if you don't give it back. But, have you considered having a print made so that you can keep a copy to enjoy?", "YTA your grandparents got it for her and it had her name on it. She let you borrow it because she\u2019s not had the space for it and now she does she wants it back. As everyone said she would have put it in storage so she let you have it till she had the room for it. She shouldn\u2019t have to exchange it with you it literally has her name on it. If you loved it so much you\u2019d have noticed before that it says your sisters name on it. Do you not think this is also something for her to remember her grandfather by? If you cared that much about having something from him you should have helped to go through things and keep them and not keep the one thing he painted for your sister. Your grandfather made it for HER that\u2019s why it has her name on it so you\u2019re going against his own wishes of her having it and enjoying it. He made it specifically for her not you so you should give it back to her.", "NTA\n\nI'm pretty sure that after 14 years in your possession, it's legally yours.\n\nBut check your jurisdiction.", "Info: what are your ages?", "It's hers. Give it back and stop being a jerk.", "Info - after 14yrs of you owing this , why does she suddenly want it back?", "NTA. You don't get things back just because it's convenient for you, especially when you just gave it away like it was nothing.", "NAH Just give it to her. It's not worth it.", "She did not give it to you. She did not have a house to keep it and I'm guessing you did. \n\nYou need to have a blunt talk about the painting with her. Will she accept cash? Another painting? \n\nHonestly, a painting is no reason to drive a wedge between you.", "NTA. \u201cOut if my cold dead hands\u201d would be part of my rant. \n\nLeave it to her in your will. Give her a copy of the will with that part.", "YTA, it literally has her name on it.  It's for her, not for you.", "Possession is 9/10 of the law kind of thing going on here. They have owned it for 14 years after sis didn't want it. They own that shit legally and reasonably.", "Look, just charge her for 14 years of storage. use that money to have a print made of it, and return the original (minus the frame of course).\n\nIf it's not reproducible then the hefty price of 14 years of storage should be enough for a couple of extra pieces.", "It\u2019s yours OP. Don\u2019t listen other people, she gave it to you without condition. A gift it\u2019s a gift. She have no reason to claim it for free.", "Yes the sister only wants it now that she has room.", "Like...just a couple questions after I say it would be nice for OP to show her sister this post (now that overwhelmingly everyone says OP is NTA).\n\nI'd like her side of the story. None of us know if she said that she would like it back someday. None of us know why she wasn't able. OP already said it's presumably because she now has space to display it. For all we know that was an agreement that was made that it would be returned when she had space, but OP never expected her to ask for it back.\n\nMy other argument is, how much does OP really care about this piece if after 14 years you just now noticed it was signed by him to her? This is the most questionable part of this story to me. You had this prominently displayed for 14 years, but never questioned the writing on it? I honestly feel like the story is t complete here.", "And the sister had no house of her own yet", "She didn't have zero regard. She did not yet own a house.", "If you read the post carefully it says \u201cat the time\u201d so they don\u2019t say they haven\u2019t noticed the small letters in 14yrs, but that they didn\u2019t notice them when they chose the painting.", "So what if it has her name on it? Having your name on something does not grant you ownership of it.\n\n>She is the one he wanted to have it, it belongs with her.\n\nThat is not how that works. She gave the painting away. Legally, where I live, it belongs to OP. It was a gift, and it was not conditional.", "I agree. Why was OP not there when the grandfather's things were being dispersed?", "She\u2019s had her house for three years\u2026", "I get the sentiment of \"You didn't help me clear things out so you don't get to complain when things get donated\", but I think there are exceptions here. My NanNan passed about a month ago, and she was living in my town. However, that was after moving over 300km away from the city she lived in and the rest of our family because my parents and I were in a better situation to support her. You can't always expect people to take time off work to travel over 300km to go through every item. I'm not saying that's what happened here, but I'm saying it's not always feasible to have all members of the family there to physically go through each item.", "If some one said you could have something and then 14 years later you decide nevermind, they should just give it back? Life doesn\u2019t work that way the sister donated most to goodwill obviously she didn\u2019t care about the sentimental value\nNTA", "OP said the sister has been living in their house for three years.", "If OP was just holding onto the painting because sister didn't have any room for it, it'd be fair for OP to give sister a bill for 14yrs worth of storage, right?", "Then do you think it'd be fair for OP to give her sister a bill for 14yrs of storage?", "It was given to her. If somebody gives you a birthday gift, is it acceptable for them to comeback and demand the item back?", "So what if it was created for her? She gave it to her sister. It is not hers anymore.", "You can't give someone something and expect to get it back 14 years later. Gift or not. That is ridiculous.", "The sister gave it to her essentially gifting it. So who is the AH now?", "The OP doesn't have anything from their grandfather, as OP's sister donated everything to Goodwill.  I think OP deserves something.", "After 14 years? Bull crap! If something meant something to her she would have put it up on any wall she had. There's no way this is about grandpa.", "The sister, according to the information presented, gifted OP the painting.\n\nI have given my friends gifts, and then some time later regretted giving my stuff away. That does not give me the right to demand the stuff back, because it ain't mine no more.", "And? It\u2019s literally made for her, was a gift for her therefore it\u2019s hers. It\u2019s icky you\u2019re not giving her gift back", "So what.", "Don\u2019t you question why OP has nothing but sister had it?", "She literally didn\u2019t have the room for the painting for those 14 years and it sounds like sister was a teenager if it was just hung up in her room when it happened", "The OP's sister literally let her have it for all these years. Do YOU give someone something and then demand it back from them at a later date? Are all your gifts loans?\n\nIt's hers now. smh. OP, you do with it what you want. If you really feel obliged, you can have her give you a replacement.", "Honestly I find a little odd that the grandfather created a piece specifically ded\u00edcated to the sister in her birthday but he never made or give anything specifically to OP while he was alive.\n\nAnd while I can understand why OP might be irritated at this request, I would return it without hesitation knowing its meaning. \n\nOf course, I would also probably compensate this if I was the sister with another piece.", "It\u2019s not hers, she was letting her use it, since it would have sit in storage.  The OP should be grateful that she had it as long as she has, but respect that her grandfather intended it for her sister, hence it says happy birthday with sister\u2019s name on it.  It\u2019s a painting that was never meant for OP, she should be grateful for the time that her sister shared it with her and not be such a baby and give it back, without hard feelings.", ">\"... she did say that I could take any artwork from her room, with no exclusions.\"  \n>  \n>\"... she so carelessly disposed of everything at Goodwill after she picked through and got whatever she wanted, with no regard for me, I only have his artwork.\"\n\nIt seems pretty self-explanatory. You give something away, it belongs to the other person, you can't just go and demand it back because suddenly you've changed your mind. That's absurd."]}
