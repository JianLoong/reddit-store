When people are younger, they don\u2019t realize how important their past relationships are to who they are now and how they became that person.

You\u2019re cherishing something he made for her, as though it some how had a special meaning to you, when the entire intention was for it to be for her. You sound like you want to benefit from this. \n\nI hate it when people say \u201cthey donated everything to goodwill with no consideration to me\u201d. Where were you when they were cleaning everything out? Didn\u2019t you think to go help? This essentially happens after every death, and if you\u2019re in contact with family, they usually talk about it.  It\u2019s not really a one day thing since there\u2019s lawyers and wills etc.\n\nI\u2019ve done this many times, no one shows up to help but then are angry you didn\u2019t hold onto things for them when they didn\u2019t show up. Like we can\u2019t keep everything forever! Nor is it our unpaid job to go through everything asking if someone wants it so they can show up  for one item and neglect the rest of the work just to grab what they selfishly want and leave. Clearing out an estate is hard work. And asking someone to put aside a bunch of things they may or may not want is just asking them to do even more work. And it\u2019s very emotional work too. \n\nI kinda think you come across as entitled and do what you will, since the painting is yours now since you took it. But you make it sound like she just wants it now because it\u2019s convenient for her, because that fits your narrative. But to me,  it sounds like grandpa died and your sister didn\u2019t think much of the painting when he was alive, since she had him, but now that he\u2019s gone she misses him and it reminds her of him and the bond they had.", "NTA\n\nIt belongs to you and she is 14 years too late", "YTA....give it back.

As everyone said she would have put it in storage so she let you have it till she had the room for it. She shouldn\u2019t have to exchange it with you it literally has her name on it. If you loved it so much you\u2019d have noticed before that it says your sisters name on it. Do you not think this is also something for her to remember her grandfather by? If you cared that much about having something from him you should have helped to go through things and keep them and not keep the one thing he painted for your sister. Your grandfather made it for HER that\u2019s why it has her name on it so you\u2019re going against his own wishes of her having it and enjoying it.

None of us know if she said that she would like it back someday. None of us know why she wasn't able. OP already said it's presumably because she now has space to display it. For all we know that was an agreement that was made that it would be returned when she had space, but OP never expected her to ask for it back.\n\nMy other argument is, how much does OP really care about this piece if after 14 years they just now noticed it was signed by him to her? This is the most questionable part of this story to me. They had this prominently displayed for 14 years, but never questioned the writing on it? I honestly feel like the story is incomplete here.\n\nEdit: OP let her pick through her room for artwork, but didn't give any courtesies to any other aspect and tossed all of grandpa's stuff?

Having your name on something does not grant you ownership of it.\n\n>She is the one he wanted to have it, it belongs with her.\n\nThat is not how that works. She gave the painting away.

My NanNan passed about a month ago, and she was living in my town.

You can't always expect people to take time off work to travel over 300km to go through every item.

Being a dumb teen who doesn\u2019t value a painting by grandpa as a birthday gift is understandable, even being a 25 yo and not wanting it because you don\u2019t understand the value is understandable, but she is a grown adult now, and has been for a while, and didn\u2019t care, and then deliberately denied her sibling the chance to have something else from their grandparents by taking what she wanted and maliciously giving away the rest to strangers so this honestly just sounds like even my suggestion that there\u2019s any regret is wrong and it\u2019s just resentment and she wants to take away the last of her sibling\u2019s connection out of spite \n\nOP is NTA but I would suggest that it might be best to have the art scanned at a print shop and reproduced anyway so there\u2019s a backup just in case sis gets her way.

Even a small artist who may not have achieved great acclaim but had sold artwork would find their artwork appreciating in price.\n\nSometimes when people suddenly care about things it isn\u2019t for sentimental reasons.\n\nDid you know if you donate things to Goodwill they\u2019re tax deductible?", "Worse, she might want it back to sell it", "This only makes sense if you wanna play silly reddit games. It's OP's painting and theyre free to keep it if they wants, and it's ridiculous to suggest anything other than OP is the rightful owner\n\nETA: to clarify, even if OP did decide to give it back ultimately, or it was determined in some way OP isnt the rightful owner, a storage fee would also be silly imo. What matters is the rightful owner should have it. Offering it for a storage fee makes it less of a sentimental item, imo, like you're ok selling it, must not be that sentimental. It turns the whole thing into a money grab instead of the real issue", "The painting was hanging in the sister\u2019s childhood room until OP took it away; otherwise it would still be hanging there (or maybe somewhere else in the house.) There was no need for anyone to store it so it seems a little silly for OP to charge a storage fee.", "I think it's ALWAYS important to read any AITA story in the context that OP is going to be biased. This story in particular just screams \"one side of the story\" as you said.", "Have you ever tried to read a SIGNATURE on a painting?\n\nA \"for sister\" could be as unreadable without explanation.  Which was only recently made apparently.  No one was pointing at picture OP's whole childhood and saying.  Look at grandpa's dedication to \"sister\".\n\nI had a friend get a painting and sent me pix to try to read signature so we could TRY to find out more about artist. I gave up after about 3 days of trying.  Magnifying image, googling possibilities.  NO luck.\n\n  \nETA here are some KNOWN ones:  [https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7d/0c/96/7d0c9639c702cc6038deb7f7388d3c5e.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7d/0c/96/7d0c9639c702cc6038deb7f7388d3c5e.jpg)", "If you're going to give someone a gift and then demand it back, don't bother giving them a gift to begin with.\n\nThat's rude and makes you a dick that should not be given anything.", "Absolutely. My wife's granny died a few years ago. My MIL lives down in the south of England, while the rest of her family including granny live up in Scotland. She had a really hard time of it because she couldn't take the time off to go up (working in a school) and her siblings all closed in really quickly. She was quite disappointed when she could finally go up and found it mostly cleared with no consideration for what she might like.", "OPs sister gets fully shat on in judgements for not wanting the painting 14 years ago. Yet OP basically shat on the whole estate by that logic. You could argue that if he really cared he could've taken a flight home to help go through his grandfather's things. He even says that the family kept the things that he asked for, so it's not like the parents deliberately destroyed/gave away everything so OP couldn't have them, but he sure acts like he is some victim with zero agency in the way the estate was divided up.\nAlso OPs sister was in college when this happened. Priorities change. I had zero interest in my grandparents things when they died, but as I grew older I asked for a few bits, because my attitudes changed. If there was a piece specifically made for me I'd be upset if it wasn't passed on to me, even if I didn't care at the time. The only place where OP has a pint IMO is that they should exchange it for another piece. Everything else is just padding to the story and woe is me bullshit.", "If they were specific items, why would you need to go through them? Also, I think I saw where you and your sister live close to each other so why would those items be in storage at your sister\u2019s house? Why didn\u2019t they take them directly to your house?\n\nAnd your parents were still there at her house when she took them to goodwill? You said they drove across country with them so I can\u2019t imagine that they drove all that way and then immediately drove back home.", "Because the grandfather was still alive then, according to OPs comments it seems he only passed in the past year which is probably why a gift that he made for her suddenly has more meaning now.", "Wow you guys are quite a horrible bunch! C", "Yes, my family has had very bad communication on it. I can also potentially understand someone not asking further questions about an item, without that automatically indicating anything about how important an item was to someone. To talk about it, you have to bring back up the death to an extent, and with some families it's just very difficult and kinda discouraged to do. It could be the parents as go-betweens leading to confused communication between both sisters?", "Except sister already took stuff of Grandpas that was set aside for OP AND she won't trade another artwork to replace it(So that OP has SOMETHING of Grandpas).\n\nSo no, OP shouldn't give \"back\" the only thing she has created by Grandpa that Sister gave her 14 yrs ago.\n\nSister gave me a christening toy that she \"outgrew\".  Years later I gave it back to her.  That was my choice, she didn't demand it back(I gave it to her in hopes she would some day be able to give it to her own child--she never got to have a baby--EVIL endometriosis)", "I agree. Grandpa obviously painted it for the sister, and even if she gave up her right to it, I think OP should give it back to her. In return, OP\u2019s sister should pay for getting a same-size print made onto canvas for OP to keep.", "Frontal lobe, 5 second rule", "How so? It\u2019s pretty horrible for sister to try to demand back something that hasn\u2019t belonged to her in 14 years after giving it away with no thought or concern.", "My parent complained all they received from father's \"estate\" was a hammer(still has it).  The brothers took everything else like vultures picking the carcass clean.", "Sure, OP can go that route, but it seems (basing this off OP wording) like it will do great damage to the relationship with parents and sister. I guess if the artwork is worth that, then OP should go ahead and hold onto it.\n\nHaving seen a similar situation play out with a similar item in my family, it\u2019s not worth it to hold onto a material object.\n\nAre the memories that OP has with her grandpa not enough? The painting was not even given to her by the grandpa. Her family is still alive and they are the people that she has to live with for many decades to come.", "Legally, you're incorrect. \nIf she wanted it that bad, she should have said something in 14 years since she regifted it. Maybe one of the times she helped move it. \n\nHe'll op is willing to trade it for another, the sister is unreasonable and entitled!\n\nOP your NTA.", "It doesn't matter. Its not OPs. Her feelings, however valid, are irrelevant.", "Also, sister took the items OP asked for specifically. These items were transported and were intended for her, and the sister took them. I don\u2019t understand why this was not an issue.", "I think asking someone back for a picture they had for 14y could damage a relationship as well. Also why is it OP who has to be the bigger person. What about the sister and parents? It seems like the artwork is worth to ruin the relationship for them as well.", "Did you read any of the other context? It feels weird to read OP's story and give this take. Grandpa didn't leave anything to anyone specifically, it doesn't sound like (considering the fact the parents had a ton of stuff for the OP and their sister that could just be given at will). OP's sister ruined any opportunity for OP to have anything besides the painting by immediately donating anything she didnt want, she's had plenty of time to ask for it back. OP's sister won't offer anything in return for OP to remember grandpa for. Yes, the signing complicates things but OP's sister at the very least didn't know it said that when she let OP take it. This painting is probably long gone if OP didn't take it. Personally, if I were to make something for someone, and someone else was going to cherish it because it came from me, I'd rather they have it then collecting dust for 14 years until the original recipient is ready to claim it, if it even still exists when it's time to claim it", "There's absolutely nothing unreasonable or entitled about wanting the painting that your grandfather painted and signed for you. Especially if you didn't realize the signature was there when you let your sister have it.\n\nOp is YTA, and people are acting crazy to say otherwise. It is absolutely insane to even want to keep the painting knowing it's meant for the sister.", "Sister also destroyed any sort of connection OP could have had with her grandpa otherwise, and refuses to make any sort of compromise in trading something else. NTA", "When you leave something for that long, it is deemed abandoned. The sister left it behind for 14 years knowing it was in OPs possession. That is abandonment and all of a sudden she wants it back? Negative, I would have said no too.", "It is though, she told OP that OP could have anything left in her childhood room. Therefore anything OP took became OPs.", "After reading OPs answers it seems that her sister had enough space to keep the piece of art, she was the first to unpack and choose among the items, and she was old enough to know what she was doing. But she decided not to claim the thing as hers, knowing that some other family member would probably take it.\n\nIf it was not for the fact her name is on it and it was originally made for her birthday, no one would take her request seriously to claim it back after such a long time. \n\nI guess that maybe her taste changed and that now she sees something in the piece of art she did not see then. As obviously she did not tell her family then that she would appreciate them keeping it safe for her but that maybe she would one day want to have it back as it was made for her, she really missed the moment and the chance to have a say in it ever again. \n\nOf course, as others have stated, she could ask politely or try to trade something in with her sister, but it is waaaaaay to late for a \"demand\". NTA, and the parents should stay out of it, too.", "Moreover, it would have been so easy to just give it to OP for safekeeping instead of gifting it. \"You can have it and display it until I have enough space to hang it myself.\" But apparently, she originally never cared about the work, and just recently and suddenly developed an interest in it.", "\"yes I would like my back up alternator that you are currently using in your car back thanks.\"", "If the inanimate object is worth ruining three relationships, then keep the inanimate object. That seems like the perfect example of cutting off your nose to spite your face.", "Wait so your grandfather passed several months ago? Well that\u2019s probably why she wants it now, his passing has made it more meaningful to her.", "Did she do that because you have her painting and won't give it back?? \n\nSounds more like settling a score if you ask me.\nWhen my great grandparents died, my great aunt let us pick through and take whatever we wanted.\n\nThere was a painting that someone made of my Papaw tilling his garden with a donkey pulling the till. I have always adored that painting, but I never in a million years would have thought to take it. I felt his daughters should be the ones to decide who received such a precious piece of artwork.\n\nBut guess who took it? My older sister. She took it, saying, \"Well, Aunt Kathryn said we could take whatever we want!\"\n\nNo one stopped her. Because everyone in my family didn't wanna rock the boat. My Papaw, bless his soul, always said, \"Keep peace within the family.\" At face value, it sounds good. But with everyone wanting to call my selfish sister out, they didn't. I can assure you, \"keeping the peace,\" has sadly been very toxic to my family. So much resentment for fear of rocking the boat, there is no peace.\n\nAnd I would never take a painting that said \"Happy Birthday, <someone who isn't me)\".  It's common sense, common decency. But that's just me.\n\nI'm going with ESH.", "Technically she didn't give it. She just never explicitly excluded anything  before OP chose a picture", "Furthermore the sister didn\u2019t left it abandoned, she agreed to gave it away. She perfectly knew where and with who it was. It isn\u2019t a possession of her anymore because she gave ownership of the painting to OP. Not a loan for lack of space. \n\nThe dedication for the sister on the painting would have been relevant if she wasn\u2019t the one giving it away. \n\nOP NTA", "My family wouldn't ask me after 14y to give something back, neither would I. I'm just saying that the points you made about OP can be made the other way around for sister and parents.", "But not the stuff that OP specifically asked for. *Right*.", "So why can't sister trade an artwork that doesn't have a \"personal connection\"?  Why is OP the selfish one?", "Some people are just assholes", "And wouldn\u2019t her parents have still been there? They drove across the country to get there so I\u2019m imagining that they didn\u2019t leave immediately.", "I learned from my family that relatives can be horrible to each other.", "You also don't get rid of a bunch of your dead relatives things that were specifically transported across the country due to carelessness. And other relatives wouldn't move on so quickly from such an otherwise blatant act of betrayal and disregard unless they didn't understand the reason why it happened, or didn't already see it coming. \n\nSomething is definitely missing from this story and it's deliberately being withheld. I can see now why the commenters are so split. The people who are immediately saying NTA and coddling OP are clearly incapable of picking up on nuances and if they did they aren't capable of critically analyzing them against the information that was given to make a fair assessment. In other words, just more echos in the chamber looking to take part in getting credit for relieving another confused individual of their own conscience. The only redeeming thing about this thread is that there's enough people who can pick up on nuances and who can use critical thinking enough so to ask the tough questions that are required to actually make a fair judgment in the first place, and that they're tipping this thread into controversial territory. \n\nIt needs to be controversial because setting straight OPs who deliberately narrate a story to balance in their favor are an itch we have in this sub that needs to be scratched. Some people could use a dose of reality and maybe they'll do a little less inconvenience to people in the future because of it. That's the true good work, not coddling people who post only for the sake of validating themselves.", "Look, if OP wants to lie to us, they're only hurting themselves. They aren't relieving their conscience if they have to lie about large swaths of the story any more than if they lied to themselves to justify what they did. I'm not going to pick and choose what an OP is lying about because while it sounds ridiculous to say that someone would be so cruel that they'd donate something in this manner, it could be true. I've certainly heard plenty of tales of families who know that a relative will never relax until they get what they want and so they try to keep the peace by appeasing them at all turns.\n\nIf there's actually a good reason to think they're lying, a contradictory piece of info or something like that, then yes it should make a difference. I don't think it makes this place any better to ignore what OP says about what's happening because we decide we know better, simply because we're incredulous about their story."]}
