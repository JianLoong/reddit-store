You never examined it, or asked your family if they knew when or why your grandfather made it?\n\nI'm also Fascinated by that little implication in your post that your sister intentionally donated your grandfather's belongings, without giving you a chance to go through them?", "It\u2019s yours, regardless of what it says on tiny letters on the bottom.

When people are younger, they don\u2019t realize how important their past relationships are to who they are now and how they became that person.

You\u2019re cherishing something he made for her, as though it some how had a special meaning to you, when the entire intention was for it to be for her. You sound like you want to benefit from this. \n\nI hate it when people say \u201cthey donated everything to goodwill with no consideration to me\u201d. Where were you when they were cleaning everything out? Didn\u2019t you think to go help? This essentially happens after every death, and if you\u2019re in contact with family, they usually talk about it.  It\u2019s not really a one day thing since there\u2019s lawyers and wills etc.\n\nI\u2019ve done this many times, no one shows up to help but then are angry you didn\u2019t hold onto things for them when they didn\u2019t show up. Like we can\u2019t keep everything forever! Nor is it our unpaid job to go through everything asking if someone wants it so they can show up  for one item and neglect the rest of the work just to grab what they selfishly want and leave. Clearing out an estate is hard work. And asking someone to put aside a bunch of things they may or may not want is just asking them to do even more work. And it\u2019s very emotional work too. \n\nI kinda think you come across as entitled and do what you will, since the painting is yours now since you took it. But you make it sound like she just wants it now because it\u2019s convenient for her, because that fits your narrative. But to me,  it sounds like grandpa died and your sister didn\u2019t think much of the painting when he was alive, since she had him, but now that he\u2019s gone she misses him and it reminds her of him and the bond they had.", "NTA\n\nIt belongs to you and she is 14 years too late", "YTA....give it back.

She let you borrow it because she\u2019s not had the space for it and now she does she wants it back. As everyone said she would have put it in storage so she let you have it till she had the room for it. She shouldn\u2019t have to exchange it with you it literally has her name on it. If you loved it so much you\u2019d have noticed before that it says your sisters name on it. Do you not think this is also something for her to remember her grandfather by? If you cared that much about having something from him you should have helped to go through things and keep them and not keep the one thing he painted for your sister. Your grandfather made it for HER that\u2019s why it has her name on it so you\u2019re going against his own wishes of her having it and enjoying it.

None of us know if she said that she would like it back someday. None of us know why she wasn't able. OP already said it's presumably because she now has space to display it. For all we know that was an agreement that was made that it would be returned when she had space, but OP never expected her to ask for it back.\n\nMy other argument is, how much does OP really care about this piece if after 14 years they just now noticed it was signed by him to her? This is the most questionable part of this story to me. They had this prominently displayed for 14 years, but never questioned the writing on it? I honestly feel like the story is incomplete here.\n\nEdit: OP let her pick through her room for artwork, but didn't give any courtesies to any other aspect and tossed all of grandpa's stuff?

Having your name on something does not grant you ownership of it.\n\n>She is the one he wanted to have it, it belongs with her.\n\nThat is not how that works. She gave the painting away.

My NanNan passed about a month ago, and she was living in my town. However, that was after moving over 300km away from the city she lived in and the rest of our family because my parents and I were in a better situation to support her. You can't always expect people to take time off work to travel over 300km to go through every item.

There's no way this is about grandpa.", "The sister, according to the information presented, gifted OP the painting.\n\nI have given my friends gifts, and then some time later regretted giving my stuff away.

At some point in all our lives we become old enough to make our own decisions regardless of what our parents insist we do, because usually their objective is to keep family peace, and that's an objective that almost always ends up with someone being walked on.

It\u2019s a very personal present with lots of meaning.  And it was never given directly, it was part of passive allowance to take from a larger group of things.  And the sister in question was young when this happened.   All in all I think the moral thing to do is give it back.", "He may have, but sis donated everything.", "One comment you said she was 25 and another you say 23\n\nI smell a one sided story", "My parents packaged up items and brought them across the country for us. Since they stayed at her house, she had first and only pick. She 100% didn\u2019t handle the estate or go through any items of his at his residence.", "Several months ago. They were pissed at how inconsiderate and selfish she was but moved on quickly because she\u2019s always been careless.", "She\u2019s had a house for three years. She had the wall. FFS, OP, it\u2019s yours she can either pay you for the painting (you determine the amount it\u2019s worth to you to sell it), she coughs up some of his other artwork as a trade, or she pays for storage with a nice big \u201cYou\u2019re a D!ck fee\u201d added to it, because she\u2019s being a D!ck. Your parents can also trade one of their pieces and then THEY can give it to her.", "But we're talking about a very specific term: take. Take does not mean borrow.\n\nIf this was a very personal present with lots of meaning, why did it take fourteen years? The sister has been living in her house for a couple years now and suddenly wanted it back. That doesn't seem like someone who valued a gift that was given to them.", "I was 23.", "I am so baffled by some of these comments.", "The amount you value something can change over time.  Sister did not have a way to display the art before, so letting OP have it made sense.  She older now, and has a home of her own.   And she wants this item back.   \n\nAt the end of the day you have to ask yourself what matters more - an object or your relationship with your sibling.   I have items from my grandfather that mean a lot of me.  If I found out one was intended for one of my brothers, I would make sure he got it.  Even if it really tied the look of my room together.  Wouldn\u2019t even be a question.", "It says in both comments \n\n\u201cShe was 23\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was 25\u201d\n\nNothing about you", "Value changing over time doesn't matter when you *give something away*.\n\nIt's obvious this isn't just an object for OP. They kept it for fourteen years.\n\nWhy is that being questioned of OP and not the other way around? Is it really worth getting an item back when you said someone could have it? If I gave someone something and regretted it (which I definitely have, and they were extremely sentimental items), I never asked for it back. That's the path I chose. I don't get to tell someone to give me back something I willingly gave away."]}
