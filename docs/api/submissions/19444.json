They might think twice about treating other tenants like that in the future.", "INFO: Do you honestly think that boarding up that window would have made the ex friend go away? That they wouldn't have tried to enter the apartment another way? Or tore the boards down?\n\nIt sounds like wishful thinking and a natural wish to lay the blame for your distress somewhere accessible.", "Civil claim? Against who? Your ex friend? Because that\u2019s who you should going after. Your ex-friend is TA here, landlord is a very, very mild asshole, if that", "It seems to me that you are blaming the landlord for the second break in on the basis that, in your view, if the window had been boarded over it couldn't have happened. \n\nBut then, you are suggesting, now the window has been boarded by the police as emergency following the second break in, that the former friend who keeps breaking it will probably destroy your apartment tonight. Unless you think he's going to commit said destruction from outside, that destruction would involve getting in via the newly boarded over window or via another access point.  \n\nOn that logic, you don't think boarding over the window would have stopped the second break in, only required a little more effort on your former friend's part. \n\nYou've also said in your post that apartment policy is that the landlord boards it and you pay them back, but in one of your comments you've said you couldn't have put the board over the window yourself because you don't have the money for it. \n\nFrom the point of view that you might have had more peace of mind if the window had been secured by the landlord as per policy earlier, and you were getting false promises they would do something covered by the contract, NTA. \n\nBut I would also note, I'd imagine it would be an uphill battle to prove the landlord has any liability for what subsequently happened, and it might be worth you considering that if you pursue a claim of liability against the landlord for the second break in, could that create you more stress than potential reward.", "I don't understand.

Is this real or just fake stuff on reddit? He hasn't been arrested? Is there no proof? USE A HIDDEN CAMERA. If he's not been booked and sent to jail then something is weird.....You need proof....Seriously is this a joke?", "I appreciate all your responses and wanted to say I'm very much not a fan of suing people if it can be avoided. I think many unfortunately take advantage of any chance they get. If I were to pursue this the only thing I would ask for is the cost of added mental health treatment for our PTSD symptoms. I go in detail in one comment here, but just speaking for myself and not my bf, this has impacted years of work I've done to heal and reduce my ptsd symptoms. Literally 2 weeks ago was the 1st time I was able to stand up and advocate for myself (ironically to the guy who broke in) in any situation. I could always set boundaries, but never enforce them. He was making me uncomfortable, but more importantly being verbally abusive to his gf. I didn't panic or back down once as I gave him a few chances to cool down and stop. When he didn't listen I kicked him out and that's when we cut ties with him which obviously angered him to lead to all this. I was so proud of myself for finally doing that. It's going to take time and more therapy to get even close to that again.", "INFO: In one of your comments you say you\u2019re in government housing so your landlord is the government. If so, are you asking about suing the relevant government housing provider or an individual? And, if the latter, who is this individual in relation to the situation?", "Thank you. I've never been one to sue or anything in so there's only one thing I'd like. We both already had PTSD, but our symptoms were manageable. I have meds that help with my nightmares that works well. Still a little jumpy in new settings, but I finally was okay when people stood behind me. I knew my triggers and was great at advocating for myself if something was hitting a nerve. I felt this well managed before the 1st incident and this actually related to our not being friends anymore. \n\nA few weeks before he came by with his gf and at one point my bf ran to the store for us. The guy got mad about something that was said and he got nasty. I spent a few min respectfully asking him to tone it down. Then added that if he didn't stop yelling he'd have to leave. He kept refusing so I kicked them out. I was so proud of myself after the fact; I stood my ground, didn't cry or get panicky, or let him have power over me. That was prob the first time I've ever been able to do something like that. \n\nNow I can't flush the toilet without scaring myself. I haven't slept at night at all, just manage to scrap some rest together during the day. Every noise makes both of us dial 9-1- and wait, ready to go. We can't put music or a show on bc we might not hear someone try to come in. Getting one of us out of the house takes over an hour and multiple ocd type rituals to feel safe. I still feel so guilty bc one day my bf went to give me a hug when I didn't expect it. I screamed \"dont touch me\" out of nowhere. I can hear the glass shattering and the wood splintering in my head when its quiet. \n\nSo if I were to pursue this I would research some additional treatment that I normally wouldn't have access to with medicaid and not having extra income. I really think a type of therapy called EMDR would help me but it's a little advanced, but the success rates are up there. The only thing I would ask for is the cost of treatment. We're in this housing program working so hard on our mental health and recovery to get back on our feet again. But in 4 days so much of what we accomplished is gone and it just sucks. I don't want to go crazy on her, just take advantage of the resources available you know?", "That's the only way they could get in bc that window is on the side of the door that has the locks so reached in and unlocked it then walked right through the door. That can't be done with the other window and the boards are screwed in a way that he'd need serious power tools to get it off. Even if he had the right tools if we called 911 they'd get to us before he could get it off. (The pd had an emergency board up done after the 2nd one. It's intense)", "We already have criminal charges against him. The landlord was legally responsible to board up the window within a certain timeframe no matter what. She promised us daily that it would be done by the end of that day as we updated her with how bad things were getting. If she had just had maintenance put a piece of wood over that hole the first time as is required he wouldn't have been able to get it in again.", "I'm honestly a little fried mentally at this point lol so I should've phrased it differently that I'm just scared of him managing to get in to destroy everything bc of how on edge we are. We don't know what to think anymore bc it seems like nothing is off limits with him. Yesterday he flat out made threats that I won't mention to follow the rules, had multiple people watching us all day and we had to form a literal escape plan to get to the shelter safely that involved throwing our bags out the 2nd floor window and running for the car. \nSo I don't think he will be able to get in bc he didn't climb through the broken window either time. He broke it so he could reach in, unlock everything and then walk right in. It was so easy to do this if someone nearby wasn't paying close attention I don't think they'd even realize it was a break in. It's not impossible to climb through the other window that's intact/not boarded, but with his body type it'd be pretty difficult. Plus (this is obv just speculation) I don't think he'd risk the time it'd take to get in and open the door so he could run when needed after the search for him that night. They even had the helicopter out. \nReally all I want to hold the landlord to is the law that it needed to be fixed within the 48 hrs. Main priority is the criminal charges and getting moved which should happen in less than a week. I don't want to go crazy and ruin/get revenge on her. I would figure out the cost of getting some additional mental health treatment for PTSD as we both have it previously. Speaking just for myself and not my bf, years of healing and hard work have been affected by this. And it'll take more treatment and time to heal from this that we don't have the funds for? \nAlso bc we're moving as victims of a crime, as long as I'm understanding the law correctly, there's a fund that will pay her for the damages, termination fees and lost rent and I believe she can also go after him for it.", "Where did I say I didn't call them? I did say the police had us block the bedroom door but I'll edit my post to clarify, there are multiple reports and charges filed over this against the guy who broke in. All that stuff is handled already. We've had to call 911 I think 18 times now this week. \nMy post is bc there is a law that she needed to fix the window within a time frame that she did not.", "If you read her comments you would learn that she\u2019s struggling and is poor", "Yeah I'm trying to put some money together for a camera, but we're pretty strapped. My bf has epilepsy so I'm trying to work and take care of him at the same time. I can send you the insane amount of pics I have if you want them I have a ton of proof I'm just gathering. You can see some of my posts in pages that allow pics if you go on my profile too. Im fairly new to reddit so if you know a subreddit I can post everything on I'd love that. I need like a masterpost. We think he has a lookout or something cause he'll just leave abruptly right before the cops arrive. They've gone to the vacant lot he stays in multiple times but if no one opens the door they apparently can't enter", "I sent you a chat if you want to know more", "Our landlord isn't the govt. She runs properties and our housing program has a set amount of units they lease from her for their clients. So we have both a lease with her company and a contract with the housing program. She has to follow NV state laws and the United States Housing Act and within those the window is an essential fix so must be done within 48hrs. It wasn't which played a role in his being able to get back in. I'd like to get some funds to treat the added PTSD symptoms which I could achieve by doing a civil suit.", "They could have just broken it again. You\u2019re not to win a lawsuit over this.", "[removed]", "I understand that it was your landlord's responsibility to do it. But if it was that easy, you could have done it yourself, rather than wait and be stressed about it.", "Ok, thanks for explaining. I guess You could of course try a civil claim, but I don't know if You will get very far with that. This intruder doesn't sound like a repaired window would stop his rampant behaviour. I am surprised he was released by the Police to go at You again. In my opinion he should have been detained for breaking and entering and threatening the inhabitants. I hope at least he is now. I am sorry You experienced this trauma.", "I said in another post that you really need some legal advice on this for the following elements:\n\n1. To determine exactly where the responsibility lies in the complex property management relationship you have described.\n2. To talk to you about the issues that may arise associated with possible reasonable steps taken to fix the window. For example, if the appropriate person lined up a contractor who didn\u2019t come, it may be the contractor who is at fault.\n3. To explain to you the limitations of such a suit, which may not allow you to claim beyond property damage.\n4. To discuss the process you would have to undertake to demonstrate liability for an exacerbation of your PTSD, if that\u2019s even possible.", "It's not getting replaced with new glass so they couldn't. It's boarded up to the point you would need some serious power tools to get that board off. And he can't climb in the window so using the other wouldn't work either. Plus that's that's not the point, we don't even need to prove he could get in again even though that did happen. Plain and simple the law is the LL has to fix it within 48 hours of written notice which she received 6/04 by noon the latest. Technically she never repaired it bc the pd did an emergency board up for us 6/07 around midnight. But the law was broken 6/06 at noon when it still wasn't done", "We live in the apt through a housing program similar to section 8 so there's the lease to follow as well as the program rules and that's the policy they have set. It might be for all of NV bc the cops told me as well before the landlord got there that she would board it right away and gave me the documents she needed to do so. We did what we could and it would be one thing if she said oh it won't be done for 5 days or that we could get it done ourselves. Just as much as he broke a law by breaking in, she broke a law by not boarding it within the legally required timeframe. What happened on wed was the literal exact reason this law exists.", "We don't have the money for it. We're in govt housing rn, if we had the funds we would've taken care of it", "He's unfortunately never been caught. We think he has a lookout or something bc he'll just leave mid sentence every time and gets away just before they get on scene. I honestly have never liked suing but just could really use it to get access to some better mental health care. If I were to move forward with it I would find a facility for PTSD and figure out the costs of us both getting some treatment there and ask only for that. We could really benefit and we're in govt housing bc my bf has epilepsy so I'm working while also being his caretaker. We have medicaid and the coverage is decent but just can't put enough funds together for something more intensive you know?", "I understand, I've reached out to all the legal aid offices I could find and so far not one has answered lol but I'll be asking our support people if they have anyone that can refer us to. Luckily Vegas has a ton of resources if you figure out how to get in touch with them", "Boarded up windows are not impenetrable.l and it\u2019s not \u201cbreaking the law\u201d to not board up a window within a certain amount of time. If your lease requires that then the LL is in breach of the lease - that\u2019s not breaking the law. Your claim is still BS because you have a causation problem.", "I think you need to run that idea by a lawyer first, because it becomes significantly more complicated if you\u2019re attempting to sue the landlord for mental health harm rather than just damage to your property given (a) your PTSD is pre-existing and (b) the landlord is not necessarily legally responsible for the impact of the person\u2019s behaviour on you.", "Our symptoms were manageable before this but esp after the 2nd time I can't even flush the damn toilet without scaring myself. My bf is having panic attacks prob at least 5 a day. And I feel awful for this, the other day he gave me a hug when I wasn't expecting it. I screamed to get off me, I feel so stupid", "I\u2019m genuinely curious about something. Why the landlord and not the person who terrorised you? Because from where I sit you\u2019ve got a way stronger claim against them for the emotional harm than the landlord.", "Of course we will. We're not saying she's responsible for the impact of his behavior, we would strictly focus on that one law that wasn't followed. I'm still learning how this all will work, but luckily we're very involved in a mental health support center our insurance provides. We're going to meet with them today so I'll ask about assessments or anything we can do to document changes. I don't know yet how it'll all be useful or not, but we have multiple professionals like the officers who've been working with us all week, our housing case manager, insurance case manager, therapists and other support staff. Other than the officers the rest have known my bf for over a year and me for almost a year which I hope can help establish patterns or whatever we need.", "This story just has so much to it and the 3k character limit so I have other posts about him. The criminal charges/reports and all that stuff is already taken care of. We must have 20 reports from this week lol I don't even know how many charges against him total bc I'm waiting for the full reports to come back to me. We've met with about 20 officers, some of them 3x. One literally saved our lives with his suggestions and he's the one who mentioned a civil suit bc he felt the landlord was dragging her feet with the window. I'm just curious so trying to get some info on this side of things. There's other shadiness going on from her end too I didn't even add here. But we have our case manager getting everything from her in writing", "You need advice from a legal professional independent of anyone associated with the housing. (A) They\u2019re not qualified and (B) They have a vested interest in not helping you here.", "Yeah I didn't mean I'm asking the Housing instead of a legal professional, I meant like getting a list of resources I can contact that'll actually answer lol", "I would question if this is the best use of your time, energy, and resources right now. Your case would be incredibly tricky. \n\nYou state that they have 48 hours to cover it up and then you pay them back. You also state you couldn\u2019t just cover it up because you didn\u2019t have the money, which means you weren\u2019t going to be able to pay her back. Now, having no ability to cover your side of the contract doesn\u2019t absolve your landlord of her side of the contract, but a good lawyer can make it hurt your case. \n\nWhich brings us to lawyers. Apartment complexes are going to either have a lawyer they work with, or at a minimum resources and greater financial ability to hire a lawyer. Can you afford a lawyer? Do you plan to represent yourself independently?\n \nAnd lastly, you want her/the complex to pay for mental health resources for your PTSD out of this. But the window breaking occurred from your ex-friend breaking in - your mental health was already set back before your landlord was in a breach of contract. I think you\u2019d find it incredibly difficult to prove that your mental health was set back detrimentally by the window not being fixed, and not by the friend stalking and harassing you.", "If you can afford cats, you can afford some crappy wood to board up a broken window.", "The United States Housing Act (Wagner Steagall) suggests otherwise.  Damage which leaves a rental uninhabitable must be repaired in a timely fashion.  Broken and damaged windows do meet this threshhold, a home with busted windows is not considered to be in a safe and habitable condition until repaired.\n\nA window is an *essential* repair.  It's really not any different from leaving the front door off its hinges for days, or leaving the front door's lock broken.  The ex friend is, while a known threat, not the *only* threat presented by that situation.  You don't have to have someone like this guy around to be endangered by a destroyed window.\n\nI'm not even sure that 48 hours is the right timeline for this, it may be 24 hours.\n\nThis is civil rather than criminal, but, yeah.  It's a violation of the law where OP lives.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure it actually allows for suing as a first resort?  OP may be able to have a 3rd party come in and do the repair, and deduct from rent payments up to the amount of that repair.  But that's easier said than done I suppose if you can't scrape the money up to pay that in the first place.", "Y'all I can't find an appropriate one so does anyone know a subreddit where I could make a massive post of absolutely everything? That would make my life so much easier and help things make sense.", "Yeah as in I don't have the money this second, not that I would never have the money for it. We're in govt housing so I believe they have this policy bc it would take the average tenant a little time to repay them. But that way they keep us and the property safe in the meantime. \nAt this point I'm not worrying about finding a lawyer and those steps. I'm just getting all the info I can and find what others think is important can be really helpful. We're so stressed we're bound to forget or not even think of something super useful. I want to learn as much as I can and of course if I reach the point of working with a lawyer and they say this is useless I'm not going to waste anyone's time and resources. But I'll never know if I don't research. For example I want to figure out if it's possible to prove how the impact this had on us evolved. I used to dispatch and take 911 calls in NJ which I thought would help me, but NV laws are so different it's bewildering. \nIn NJ the 1st incident would've been considered b&e without a doubt. No matter how many times we hung out with him, interacted with him, whatever. If he was told he could not come in and smashed a window to do just that, it's a crime.\nHere the 1st incident was just a report for damage so the landlord could fix a window bc at one point he did have consent. Or that's what the pd and landlord said, I found laws that contradicted that, but haven't been able to confirm for sure. And once he broke in again they went back on that and considered it a crime. \nBut from my experience in dispatch I feel like the recordings of the calls could be useful. Even though he'd broke in I was pretty calm and functional on the very first call. Was a little panicked, but had control of my tone and emotions. I was great as a dispatcher bc of my ability to stay calm and focused. And I thrived in that setting.\nThe 2nd break in I was a mess like I never had been before. I think I screamed for most of it. Couldn't stay focused on anything. I still provided the useful answers but then would break down again. I hope and believe (I know this is entirely speculation) if anyone were brought in to evaluate the tapes they'd be able to tell I genuinely thought I was about to die.\nAlso the same 3 officers came on the 7th at 5pm when we added another report for stalking based on all the times he'd returned. They spent a solid 1-1.5hrs with me which was on recorded on bodycams where I was frustrated, but totally calm. They asked about how everything was affecting us and I mentioned having trouble sleeping, being scared to go out, his comment that he can see our every move from where he hides. \nWhen they came at 8pm for the break in we were both shaking, couldn't breathe, in tears. Our handwriting on our statements was funny to us after the fact bc we were both shaking so bad they were similarly terrible lol. \n\nThis could all be useless junk, but it can't hurt to find out.", "I'd like to see that math. I think our dry food costs $10 2x a month and litter like $15 1x a month. Plus the occasional 70\u00a2 a can treat of wet food. As opposed to $250 that needs to appear instantly. Also it's not like you buy a piece of plywood and if you smack it hard enough against the wall it sticks like those bracelets lmao. The wood used is heavier than I am and as thick as my wrist. Plus all the screws used which I don't think are cheap since they can go through a concrete wall. Plus either buying/renting the power tool to screw them in or hiring someone to do it.", "Thank you lol this might sound really dumb but I want to make sure. Is filing a civil claim the same as suing them? Or is there any difference? She's also done many other shady things to the point we're no longer reaching out to her directly/by ourselves. I would say obv we answer her if she contacts us, but she has been silent since the 2nd break in. We trust our housing program case manager and the program itself which is a separate entity from her. So anything we want to discuss we tell the case manager and she gets the answer in writing from the landlord. \nShe wound up not even being the one to board the window, the cops weren't going to wait anymore/risk anything else so they had their emergency board up company do it and sent her their bill which is prob triple the price. BUT she went back on us being responsible for paying her back so that we could use the victim of a crime law to break the lease real fast. My guess is she thinks we have a case bc why else would she agree to eat the repair cost, term fees, and 4 months of lost rent instead? Although another up possibility is maybe she could risk losing the arrangement with the housing program for any violations on her end. Cause we would lose our housing for a violation so I think she could too.", "You don\u2019t spend $250 on wood to temporarily board up a broken window.", "Sorry I didn't realize I didn't have it in the original post. The landlord was originally charging us $250 for the board up. But thats a moot point bc  \n1. We were not given the option to do it ourselves. We have both the lease and the housing program rules to follow (possibly NV laws as well) which all require the landlord to do it. I don't know why, but that's literally the policy we have no choice but to follow. And\n2. After the 2nd break in she went back on us being responsible since he used to be a guest and let us term the lease early as victims of a crime", "It is total nonsense to say that a tenant is precluded from boarding up a broken window, even if the lease places the obligation on the landlord. If your landlord was hit by a bus and ended up in a coma and your window was broken, you\u2019re taking the position that you wouldn\u2019t have to fix it. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.", "Yeah I don't know what I'm talking about even though I'm the one who signed the lease and program rules. \nInstead of the totally anecdotal reason you gave I can provide you with a legal reason I'm not responsible. In the United States Housing Act as well as Nevada state laws (I can provide you with the links if you'd like them too) this would be an essential fix meaning the landlord would by law (not just policy) need to board it within 48 hours of written notice. So the potential issue/concern with a tenant fixing it when there's this law in place is what happens if I don't do it correctly? I don't know all the building codes, laws, policies, procedures etc that apply to make sure it's fixed properly as opposed to the person who's literal job is to know all of those. In any case where something went wrong it'd suddenly be very murky waters of who is at fault and to what extent. \nThey'd have to create regulations for who could give instructions, the proper instructions, proper sources of materials, proper verification that it was fixed. What if someone got the instructions from the landlord, but had a learning disability and misunderstood. What if a tenant went to the store asking for the correct type of wood and a store employee gave them something else?\nSee how many things can go wrong here extremely quickly? I'll try to find verification, but I feel like that's a very logical reason why it makes it safer and easier to have the landlord do it.", "Also you do know it's very rarely the actual landlord doing the board up right? It's either the maintenance company which using your example that'd be a wildly unfortunately accident for the whole team to be in a coma. Or if the landlord just has one property they hire a company that does it for them like the pd wound up doing for us."]}
