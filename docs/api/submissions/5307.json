I love dogs, but between your allergies and the high energy level of this dog, this isn't an unreasonable request.", "NTA.\n\nJust the allergy aloni is a good reason, and it is your house, your choice.\n\nAlso, it is for a short time, so I don't see the problem.\n\nIf you give in now, then they will bring the dog everytime.", "NTA - your daughter seems to care more about the dog than her parent. This is a reasonable request.", "NTA\n\nWhat they want is for you to let them have things their way, which is why they aren't even going to entertain any other option. Also, this isn't you driving a wedge in the family, this is you making boundaries. If you don't have boundaries, then you will get walked over each and every time. She is your daughter, but your daughter is showing that she doesn't respect your boundaries on this.", "NTA or unreasonable.  I have a similar allergy and don't allow dogs in my house for an extended period of time like that.  In the summer as you mentioned, no problem.  But running around and getting fur and everything else everywhere to the point you have to do a deep clean after they leave is a problem.\n\nThe dog will be fine for a couple of hours by himself at home or kenneled in a utility room that is easier to clean.", "NTA. I am a dog person. If someone doesn't want me bringing my dog to their property, I say, \"ok then.\" Everyone is entitled to enforce their own boundaries in their own home. \n\nIf they are only half an hour away, they could pop back for a little bit to let the dog out if they are at yours for a long period of time. Given that they will only be at yours a few hours, it's fine to leave the dog for that period.", "NTA\n\nIts your health and there is no need to suffer at your own home.\n\nThe other reasons are good points aswell and its not your obligation to seve the owners of a dog.\n\nStay your ground.", "If it\u2019s your home, NTA! Not everyone likes dogs not to mention the degree at which individuals socialize their dogs is vastly different. I would understand if the dog was trained but obviously the dog would not only cause you health problems but it would also cause you mental problems. You have offered solutions to the problem and if they refuse, I say let them skip the event and try again later.", "NTA - my borther has a dog that he brings to my parents house when we have family dinners altogether (every 2 weeks). however the dog is not allowed at my home and if I leave for vacation and my parents babysit my cats while I am away the dog is also not brought to their house because he attacks the cats. It has never caused an issue. It's called respect.\n\nEither way, it is your home and if you do not want their pet in your home you are allowed. They are being as entitled as people with children when others say child free weddings etc. It's an animal, it can stay at their home for a few hours while they come to yours for dinner and to open presents.", "NTA it\u2019s your house and you have allergies.", "NTA. I love dogs and am a dog owner, and deffinitely never assume or feel entitled to bring my dog anywhere. We have had to adjust our lifestyle- i.e we may not stay out as long or may have to go home for a bit and come back, etc. It's just what being a dog owner is.", "NTA, it drives me nuts how people don't take allergies seriously. Now you're the bad guy why, because you want to be able to breathe in your own home? Ridiculous!\n\nSome advice though, it weakens your position if you come up with extra reasons. If you say the dog cannot come here because of my allergies that's a strong statement. If you then continue: \"And furthermore, we redid the lounge at great expense, and the dog has too much energy,\" then it starts to look like you're making excuses.", "NTA i have a dog and I love my dog but I\u2019m not entitled to just bring it to other people\u2019s houses and that\u2019s perfectly fine. Your daughter and partner need to realize this and plan accordingly.", "NTA \n\nYou have allergies. End of story. The rest of it is just icing on the cake.", "NTA.  \n\nI have dogs but I don\u2019t bring them to people\u2019s houses nor do I want their dogs at my house.  You don\u2019t need a reason or excuse to say, \u201cleave the dog at home.\u201d", "NTA\n\nYour home, your rules. You won't just be visiting with the dog a few hours. The dog hair will remain long after they are gone. \n\nPeople don't need to take their dogs everywhere they go. Dog can stay home.", "This is stuff you think about before you get a dog. Comical NTA.", "NTA and you really don't have to provide a list of reasons for someone not to bring a dog to your home.", "NTA\n\nYou have an allergy, that alone should be reason enough for them to keep their dog at home. I love dogs but they don't need to go with you to every single event, especially when someone's health is involved.", "NTA. There is no need to bring the dog and your concerns are valid. Even the most well-behaved dog can have accidents, knock things over, etc. There's a reason there nothing breakable on my coffee table- my dog's tail will clear it in one sweep. But that's an adjustment I'm willing to make for my dog and and at my house. It would be unfair to ask someone else to do the same. Especially when staying so close to home.\n\nEdit because I hit save too fast", "NTA.  My husband and I love our dogs more than anything else in the world, but of course we know they aren't welcome everywhere!  Especially considering your allergy!  \n\nKeep putting your foot down, you have the right to literally breathe without issue as well as just wanting less chaos on Christmas morning.  They all have to know their dog can't just go everywhere with them.  \n\nYour house, your rules, your air your breath!", "NTA but don't cry and whine when they change their plans and your wife blames you. You can make whatever rules you want but you need to be prepared when they decide not to visit due to those rules.", "NTA.   Your wife should support you in this.    Even a slight allergy, with being indoors with the pup for what seems like at least a couple of hours isn\u2019t healthy for you.", "NTA\nFrom your tone, it doesn't look like your allergy is the problem but the dog itself. Anyways, your house-your rules. Its few hours, they can leave him with someone or even home if they have backyard", "NTA. I get not wanting to leave your dog alone but it should be able to survive a few hours on its own. Plus you provided a few options as alternatives. They are just being unreasonable.", "You aren't TA for not wanting them to bring their dog. You have an allergy, the dog is high energy and Christmas is chaotic anyways, and at the end of the day your house your rules.\n\nI will say though..  you are a bit of an AH for suggesting to keep their dog in their car, alone, *for hours* if they decide to bring it. That's cruel to the dog. If they decide to bring it, then you can just simply tell them at the door that your gave them ample notice about your dog boundary this year, and you'd appreciate if one of them took it home. If they decide not to no abide by that boundary, that's a them problem.", "NTA. I have a really needy dog who wants to go everywhere the family go, but dogs aren\u2019t always appropriate house guests and we\u2019ve respected that for the 6 years we\u2019ve had him.\n\nAnyone who puts their convenience before your basic comfort and ability to relax in your own home would be TA here.", "NTA, even if you didn't have a legitimate health concern. I have a rescue, I worked in rescues, I frequent the dog training subreddits. I love dogs and all animals. A lot of high energy dogs to have to be taught to relax inside the house as it doesn't come naturally to them. (Sounds like your daughter has not done this) But I do not enjoy overstimulated pups running all over the place during an already busy time and your daughter is acting entitled. \n\nYou offered the fair compromise of a crate in a separate area, which is how *my* manic 11mo rescue will be spending Christmas morning- with a lovely edible chew to keep him occupied.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only two homes they visit regularly are my MIL/FIL & SIL/BIL homes because they are invited. \n\nMy MIL does say she only allows dogs because we forced them on her (SIL/BIL have 1 dog), but she is also the first to ask where they are if we do leave them behind. She\u2019s also the first to ask if we\u2019re going to order anything for the dogs when we go out to eat, so we know she\u2019s only teasing.

Hours? Days? A week?", "NTA, I love my dogs and I\u2019ll take them to family\u2019s house if they are ok with it. Even though they always are I always ask, every time to make sure. They need to get their dog trained and a dog can be by himself for periods of time and if they are really worried they could hire a dog Walker and or sitter.", "NTA.

Which of course will be my fault..", "Couple of hours I expect", "You're not being completely unreasonable to not want the dog in your house but I think you should come up with a compromise. The dog can't stay in the car, and if the dog is a package deal with them then they either have to not attend or bring the dog.  It's 2 hours, is there not a single room in the house for the dog to go? Somewhere warm and comfortable. You would absolutely be an asshole to force the dog to stay in the car but so would they if they do that.", "I have suggested an alternative room that would be warm and dry, but the dog would need to go in a cage for its own protection as there are things it could chew on that would be harmful. \n\nHappy to provide it with a tasty chew and water but this option was rejected too"]}
