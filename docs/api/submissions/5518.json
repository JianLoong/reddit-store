You did neither, just left her.\n\nThat is why you are a major AH.", "ESH\n\nYour mom and her husband suck because they should've talked to you upfront, like 2-3 days before. If you had something planned, they should've called in someone.\n\nYou, however, became an asshole when you left that kid unattended.", "ESH - not including what everyone else has already said, it sounds like you might have some resentment for your half-sister because she is receiving treatment you wish you had as a child. while your treatment is 1000% the fault of your mother, that doesn't mean you should project it onto a 4 year old child", "ESH. You let a blameless 4-year-old hit her head out of spite. It\u2019s not parentification to ask a 21-year-old who does nothing all day to get off her ass and do something besides complain. Move out, get therapy but don\u2019t take it out on a kid.", "Both of you are AH. That's child neglect.", "This OP has posted here before and she legit HATES her younger sister. She didn't just flunk out of college, she got caught with drugs and blames her mom. She also doesn't work or contribute to the household. \n\n\nI'm definitely voting YTA.", "OP was stuck between a rock and a hard place. If she looked after the 4 y/o this time then she'd have to keep doing it because the mum would know she values the 4 y/o over her freedom. She should've been present and let the 4 y/o wreck the house but only stop her when she's about to hurt herself", "Don't forget OP \"flunked\" out of college and is living off mom's dime right now.  If OP is that scarred she needs to get a job and move out.", "CPS is not going to intervene if a little kid is left with a 20something half sibling for a night of babysitting, regardless of the sibling's opinion of the matter.", "OP is lucky the kid didn't end up dying. Holy shit.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The basement-dweller OP actually left a kid alone. WHAT did she have to do more important in the basement? Gaming? Watching a show? ESH big time.", "Op is nta mom is the AH and op is not becuse op said no mutiple times the mom didn\u2019t listen and still left the kid alone bassicly since mom was already told \u2018no I\u2019m not going to watch the kid.\u2019 By OP mom knew op proably wasn\u2019t going to watch the kid but still left the kid alone. Plus it\u2019s mentioned that mom neglected op I don\u2019t think op really wants anything to do with the kid becuse it\u2019s bassicly seeing the kid get the life op would\u2019ve wanted as a kid", "YTA.  This.  She\u2019s lied in her post about flunking out of college and has issues with drugs and psychological issues.  I\u2019m wondering if her mom had some sort of medical appt or emergency, not a dinner reservation."]}
