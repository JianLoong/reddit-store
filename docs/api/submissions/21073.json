I was invited to a friends traditional religious ceremony, and from the trip so far I assumed that you would not be comfortable with the food or the restrictions on alcohol etc. I was also a guest in their home and did not want to risk causing them any offence. I hope you had a nice day to relax in the hotel. If we travel in future together this has shown that it\u2019s important we both have space from each other when we\u2019re away to do our own thing.\u201d", "I believe people who do this don\u2019t want to admit they don\u2019t like traveling but like saying they\u2019ve traveled to other people. \u201cI\u2019ve been to x, y, and z last year\u201d but can\u2019t talk about the unique things a place offers when asked.", "For me, is that I hate wasting time eating when I can be wandering around and sightseeing stuff. So i pick the fastest safe thing to not lose time and the eat at night", "The thing that kills me is that if you read Agatha Christie\u2019s books from 100-80 years ago American tourists are described in EXACTLY the same way (and British ones aren\u2019t much better)", "Look my dad is retired and I don\u2019t want him to have no travel experiences because he\u2019s on his own. But I would plan one trip a year to be a good daughter, that I know is really for him to enjoy, somewhere he\u2019d be comfortable. I\u2019ll do the adventuring with my friends. Maybe this is something OP can discuss with Mom - a week in a resort every year or two instead of her tagging along", "It's very cold in February, made the faulty assumption that it would be mild since it's very hot during the summer months, I was very mistaken. It was below freezing at night.", "Well, then she will get over it or die mad.", "So? That\u2019s what no contact is for. No one can hear her tantrum then.", "Listening to tantrums and giving them what they want just proves to them that tantrums work. Need to teach them otherwise and stick to your guns. If they don't stop tantrumming that's their problem.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I'm always surprised the things \"normal\" people do just to be able to brag or seem like they have money to other people. \n\nI don't do things I don't like, unless it's necessary for survival (work, taking out the trash), or I feel morally obligated to (visiting my dad in a state I don't like).", "Yes and from Op story it sounds like her dad traveled before he was housebound. Maybe mom and dad \u201ctraveled\u201d a lot but it was mainly to big resorts and she\u2019s not expected the reality of the medina - Morocco is INCREDIBLE but it\u2019s a full on experience when you first arrive. It\u2019s much closer to Europe (3hr) and more widely visited I think", "This. I don't spend thousands of dollars to have someone else ruin my vacation, and with OP's mother, the chances of the vacation being ruined are 100%.", "It sounds like OP might be living with her. I can't see why else she would need to book her mum into a hotel so she could have a day out", "Stop sharing plans with your dad. Share the experiences after they happen.  Problem solved!", "How about book your flights before you even tell her about the trip? It's not your fault she can't get a flight with you! I mean I get mothers that push themselves into your lives because mine does, but you need to stand up for yourself and just not let her. Tell her no you were going alone this time!", "How about you share your travel plans with dad AFTER you return? You can also share pictures, trinkets and stories with him. \n\nAlso, I sort of concerned how your father is bed bound but mom is constantly inviting herself on trips. I mean, I know caregiver burnout is real but sheesh.", "So tell him the details AFTeR you get there", ">so I can't not tell her.\n\nYou can, you just choose not to. \n\nWhich means you have a choice: continue to take her with you and be miserable, or tell her \"no\" when she invites herself.  And if you still want Dad to help you plan, then swear him to secrecy.", "You can tell him where you are going and what you plan to do there without sharing exact dates, flights, and hotels.", "Ok then enjoy not enjoying your trips anymore as long as you keep doing this.", "\"I've tried nothing.  Why isn't anything changing?\"", "Are you just willfully ignoring that op told her what sort of clothes to pack, and was ignored. Or that her mother has been acting like every ugly American tourist stereotype, wanting to go inappropriate places, refusing to eat local food because clearly the locals are dirty and will make her sick. Do you really think op didn't try to take her to nice little restaurants and street food stalls, or show her the sights, even though this was supposed to be op's trip and now she's supposed to be tour guide to someone determined to have a bad time and ignore advice."]}
