Your mother needs some friends of her own and take responsibility for her travel plans.\n\nFind out if any of your friends have mothers who are lonely that you can introduce mother to.

OP - It's important to share with your mom a list of specific behaviors & attitudes she's exhibited on this trip & others that made you feel as though it wouldn't be appropriate to bring her to the religious celebration, constructively of course. This way she knows where her faults lie & may even want to work on them. This is what I do with my daughter, who's 7.

I just have a lot of empathy for her and think she\u2019s probably honestly scared of said parent. I grew up with a parent like that and setting boundaries, even as an adult, literally resulted in being followed and screamed at/harassed by other family members at said parents behest/being excluded from family stuff and it took me a long time to decide that I valued myself more than pleasing a parent who couldn\u2019t respect me as a person.", "Because I like to share my plans with dad, but he is hed bound at home, and she is always there too.", "I share my plans with my dad, he is bed bound, and loves that he can help me plan my trips, since he was the travel enthusiast too.\n\nShe is always there, so I can't not tell her.", "Sorry, but I don't agree with you.

I expect OP to try to help mom adapt more, to explain, to help her see the joy it is. \n\nMom is there for OP. Mom wants to share something with OP. It must've been heartbreaking to see those stories. Its one thing to see your kid doing all the fun magical things when your back at home, to see it still happening even when you follow them halfway around the world. It's gonna hurt. Hurt more than OP probably realized and that's why OP feels like an ass.", "Yeach I get where you're coming from. I still don't think op is an ass. I hope they can enjoy their time together. Maybe op can show th mom around more and help her understand the new environment, culture, customs. Don't wanna judge too hard on the mom but have a feeling she won't find the joy in things as op does. But here's to hoping, lol."]}
