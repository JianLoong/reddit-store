Also English is not my native language. \n\nI (23F) don't have any close relatives anymore. I never knew my father or his side of the family and my maternal side had some major drama that happened before I was even born causing my mother cutting all contact except for my grandmother and two nephews. I don't know what happened and now it's too late to ask. My grandmother died 10+ years ago and my aunt and those two nephews died as well 7 years ago in a terrible car crash. \n\nThree years ago my mother died in an accident, leaving me practically alone. As her sole heir I inherited beside other things a town house in the countryside which was passed down from the grandmother. It's a beautiful house with a big garden that was in the family for some generations, as far as I know. It requires some repairs and I'm slowly working on that. But in the years after my mother's death I've been struggling a lot with the concept of mortality and the suddenness of it. In my country, if after death of an individual no relative claims the inheritance, it would all go to the state. I would hate this house to dissappear into nothingness and therefore I decided to draw up a will and leave it to my best friend.  We've talked about it and she is cool with it, saying that she doesn't care if she is in the will or not, but if this gesture gives me a peace of mind than she's glad to help. At the time of drawing up the will, I truly thought I was alone and no other relatives knew about me or cared. \n\nRecently my grand-aunt (grandmother's sister) reached out to me. I was vaguely aware that some time before my mother's death she was in contact with my mother, like a simple call once a month, maybe my maternal side was trying to mend bridges, I never cared and never asked. My grand-aunt is actually pretty nice if a bit old-fashioned in her beliefs. I discovered that I actually have a lot of distant relatives but almost all of them live some place away or another. \n\nA couple of days ago we were talking and it turned out into quite an emotional conversation and the town house came up. My grand-aunt asked me what I'm planning to do with it and I, distraught with emotions, stupidly let it slip that it's in my will to go to my best friend. My grand-aunt instantly blew up at me, saying that I have no right to give out a family house to some stranger, I was an asshole to do so and my mother would be ashamed of me, why give it out to someone when I have so many relatives and so on. I started crying and hung up on her. Since then I'm ignoring all her calls and messages.\n\nWas I really an AH to do so? I'm starting to doubt my decision, it's not like I can't change my will if I want to but I don't really know any of my relatives and my best friend was my rock ever since my mother died.
