{"id": 24996, "submission_id": "15vagb7", "title": "AITA for leaving family inheritance to my best friend and not the relatives?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I don't want this on my main. Also English is not my native language. \n\nI (23F) don't have any close relatives anymore. I never knew my father or his side of the family and my maternal side had some major drama that happened before I was even born causing my mother cutting all contact except for my grandmother and two nephews. I don't know what happened and now it's too late to ask. My grandmother died 10+ years ago and my aunt and those two nephews died as well 7 years ago in a terrible car crash. \n\nThree years ago my mother died in an accident, leaving me practically alone. As her sole heir I inherited beside other things a town house in the countryside which was passed down from the grandmother. It's a beautiful house with a big garden that was in the family for some generations, as far as I know. It requires some repairs and I'm slowly working on that. But in the years after my mother's death I've been struggling a lot with the concept of mortality and the suddenness of it. In my country, if after death of an individual no relative claims the inheritance, it would all go to the state. I would hate this house to dissappear into nothingness and therefore I decided to draw up a will and leave it to my best friend.  We've talked about it and she is cool with it, saying that she doesn't care if she is in the will or not, but if this gesture gives me a peace of mind than she's glad to help. At the time of drawing up the will, I truly thought I was alone and no other relatives knew about me or cared. \n\nRecently my grand-aunt (grandmother's sister) reached out to me. I was vaguely aware that some time before my mother's death she was in contact with my mother, like a simple call once a month, maybe my maternal side was trying to mend bridges, I never cared and never asked. My grand-aunt is actually pretty nice if a bit old-fashioned in her beliefs. I discovered that I actually have a lot of distant relatives but almost all of them live some place away or another. \n\nA couple of days ago we were talking and it turned out into quite an emotional conversation and the town house came up. My grand-aunt asked me what I'm planning to do with it and I, distraught with emotions, stupidly let it slip that it's in my will to go to my best friend. My grand-aunt instantly blew up at me, saying that I have no right to give out a family house to some stranger, I was an asshole to do so and my mother would be ashamed of me, why give it out to someone when I have so many relatives and so on. I started crying and hung up on her. Since then I'm ignoring all her calls and messages.\n\nWas I really an AH to do so? I'm starting to doubt my decision, it's not like I can't change my will if I want to but I don't really know any of my relatives and my best friend was my rock ever since my mother died. I feel like she is more my family than any of them.", "created_utc": 1692433713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vagb7/aita_for_leaving_family_inheritance_to_my_best/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go NC, you do not need such people in your life. If she continues harassing you, file a report.", "NTA OP, she only reached out bc she wants/ed something out of you, and that being the house. Since she see that you don\u2019t have any other immediate family(such as children etc.) and mentioned \u201cwhy give it to a stranger when you have so many relatives\u2026\u201d to me it seems like she would want the house for her children or a relative she may favor\u2026? Or could be even for herself (not sure how her living situation may be) \n\nI\u2019ve kinda experienced this (not first hand but seeing my mom\u2019s relatives or even family friends fight for property that was left for them) there always people that are going to be greedy. \n\nI suggest cutting ties especially if she keeps harassing you.", "NTA - the vultures are circling you before you are even dead.  If this aunt had reached out to you years ago and had been in constant contact with you over the years then it would be a different story.  But my guess is that she reached out just to find out who would get the property.\n\nYou willed it to a friend who has been there for you.  You might want to check with an attorney to make sure the will is airtight and the relatives can't break it after you are gone though.", "NTA- if this woman has never being in your life until now, she isn\u2019t family. She\u2019s an opportunities who thinks she is entitled to your estate because of a common drop of DNA. Your best friend is your family, and one day you may have children of your own. \n\nFamily is what you make it.", "Send back the newly discovered relatives to the woodwork from whence they came. Family is not just blood. Your bff is your chosen family. Blood family can suck it.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Your estate should go to however you want within the limits of the law.\n\nNot legal advice, but you should leave your living family members \"something\" in the will, just so there is not a chance they can contest that you \"forgot\" about them.", "NTA\n\nYou are 23. Unless you are really unlucky, you have a fair bit of life ahead of you. You might find a partner and get married. You could have kids. These things would mean that you need to change your will. Even if your will was giving stuff to your family. Having a will is a smart idea. Right now your friend *is* your family. It isn't just about blood.", "From the sounds of things your great aunt IS a stranger, and even more so some distant relatives you\u2019ve never met. It\u2019s yours to leave to whoever you wish. \n\nNTA and if your great aunt is no longer interested in a relationship, her motives in contacting you would seem pretty clear.", "NTA.\n\nbeing bloodkin does not make them family. period.\n\nalso, they had years to contact you, to built a relationship with you. to become a part of your real family. be someone who stands by your side. \n\nwho pee their pants laughing after you face planted on the sidewalk but helps you up and lend you their jacket / sweater since you ripped your shirt. who run to the drug store to get the band aid for your bleeding cut. \n\nsounds like really good bff's?\n\nyes, they are.\n\nbloodkin FaMiLy = people you got saddled with at birth. sometimes condolences are needed.\n\nheart family = people you choose for yourself. who are there for you. \n\nwhen you call them at 2am ***'i have a problem and need help'*** they show up with their own wheelbarrow, shovel, pickaxe, saw, tarp, tape, bleach and just want to know where to deposit the corpse. no questions asked.\n\nso do not feel guilty. \n\nand who knows, maybe one of your bloodkin reaches out to you, wants to know you. \n\nit can lead to a new member of your heart family.\n\nif they just want to be greedy, well, you having a will where they are disinherited, think of the will as a defense against moocher / leeches.\n\nbest of luck op, stay strong.", "I mean NTA but I had a best friend of almost 20 years who I could never imagine life without... and we're not friends anymore. You honestly never know what might happen. 23 is young. One day you might want to change the will to gift it to a godchild, or your honorary niece/nephew/little sibling.

Your best friend is not a stranger to you. Your blood relatives are the strangers.", "NTA. Sadly speaking from my own experience, when you mend bridges with estranged family, it's nice for a while, but eventually you see the side of them that made going no contact a good idea in the first place. And this was that moment with her. It sucks because it always happens after things have been going well enough to get your hopes up. \n\nYou haven't done anything wrong. Your best friend is found family, and that's the most meaningful type of family imo. I have blood family I love with my whole heart and am infact planning to leave some of my inheritance to. But that is specifically because that person put in the effort and time to become just as close and dear to me as my (other) best friends. The rest of my blood family get the same as they put into making me feel loved and wanted: nothing.", "NTA - It is yours to will it to ever you wish.  It is not the 'family's' house but your house.  Your friend must mean a lot to you whereas you don't even really know this long lost family member.  DNA doesn't always mean family.", "NTA but your great-aunt is. Your family have never behaved like family to you. Hopefully ( if it is what you want) you will have your own family one day.
