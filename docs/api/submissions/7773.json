The fact that she was done did not mean you were. If she wants to go to the gym with you, it is a dickish move to declare that when she is done you have to stop to take her home. In addition to motivation, she needs some lessons in manners.", "Haha NTA, if she really think you\u2019ll cut your exercise short because she\u2019s exhausted after 20 minutes for her, she shouldn\u2019t have asked you in the first place. She wasn\u2019t looking for a gym buddy, she was looking for a pt", "NTA wth you shouldn't feel bad at all, and she should be proud of herself for getting 20mins in. She asked to join you, she's entitled to do it at her own pace. What she's not entitled to is to sabotage your pace to match hers.", "NTA she chose to come with you. It's your gym time also. It's fine that she wanted to leave earlier and isn't understandably going to do the same session time as you.

Or next time come with her own car and do as much then leave.", "NTA considering most workouts take more than 20 minutes but you should've set the expectation of how long you were going to be there before going with her. Next time maybe ask her to get a ride and text her when she should come - when you're over halfway done with your workout then leave together.", "NTA. 60 minutes is a normal workout and asking her to wait while you finish is reasonable. But learn this lesson - if your workout is important and it takes a certain amount of time, make that clear before you carpool with someone.

One day, you'll find yourself waiting for someone who takes 2 hours when you would have preferred to drive yourself.", "NTA, you weren't shaming her, you just wanted to get your workout in.  She should have driven herself.  I get gym anxiety, but this sounds like she's looking for a way to get out of the gym.", "NTA.

I've heard of this kind of thing before (\"Oh, you walk your dog every night? I'll come with you! And if I say I don't want to you should MAKE ME!\") It never ends well. Suggest a class she might sign up for, or give her the name of a personal trainer you trust who can maybe set up sessions that get longer as her endurance improves. But it's up to her to contact the trainer or sign up for the classes. Don't let anyone try to hold you responsible for getting her in the gym or holding her hand while she's there.

I'll be starting at a gym myself next month after several years of not exercising.  I wouldn't expect someone with a regular workout routine to cut theirs short to accommodate me.", "NTA, 20 minutes is nothing (and i say that as a larger man myself) and you shouldn't have to change your whole routine for her.\n\nYou should suggest still working out together but driving separately if she doesn't want to stay as long as you.", "NTA. Take away the fact that it\u2019s a gym. Why is her need to go home more important than your need to stay? This is the risk she took by asking you for a ride? Telling her that you aren\u2019t ready to go after 20 minutes is not humiliating\u2026.on a good note, your brother and SIL seem perfect for each other!", "NTA\n\nThere could have been more communication around how long you'd be at the gym. \"I usually am there for an hour.\" Then she'd know ahead of time that's what she was signing up for. When I goto the gym with friends this is one of there first things we discuss: how long will we be there.\n\nHer embarrassment for not being a gym goer is not your responsibility. She didn't express any feelings of discomfort to you when you were present, so how would you expect her to feel that way? Just because some fat people are embarrassed in the gym, doesn't mean they all are! Plenty of fit fat people (oh hi Lizzo!) exist.\n\nYou were not acting as her trainer. You were there to be there together. You weren't even doing the same things, presumably. If she needs a cheerleader she can pay a personal trainer for that.", "NTA She could've voiced what her expectations were to you directly or gotten more info about what your gym routine looked like before deciding to drive there with you.", "NTA. If she wants to leave after 20 minutes she can drive herself and leave when she's ready. At 20 minutes your heart rate just got up. Leaving and resting then starting again is a selfish ask.", "NTA - THIS is why I don\u2019t like going to the gym with other people who don\u2019t work out as much. If I stay and do my full workout after they\u2019re done, I feel bad but if I end my workout early just because they are done, I feel cheated. \n\nOP goes to the gym a lot. She has a routine. SIL wants to get in shape. Great. But she\u2019s just starting out and it takes time to build up stamina.

You didn't put her up on this and then give up on her, she gave up on herself and now they're blaming you for their feelings of inadequacy.

She could stretch, or use the sauna, or read a free magazine, or watch TV while waiting. She could play on her phone and look up new exercise clothing to reward herself with for meeting future goals.

Or walk some laps in the parking lot. \n\nHowever there was probably a missed opportunity for OP and SIL to communicate expectations.", "NTA.  Too different fitness levels.

Twenty minutes was probably a lot to her, and it probably was embarrassing.  \n\nThe question is do you actually want to help her get started working out or are you just letting her tag along to be polite?  If you are genuinely interested in helping her, she could probably really use some advice/coaching, etc., but it will also take some work on your part.", "NAH. \n\nIt *was* probably pretty embarrassing for her.

As a gym rat myself, I know that the answer is probably yes. But when you\u2019ve pledged your support to a newbie, it\u2019s important to actually support them and help them build positive gym experiences that keep them coming back and building a healthier lifestyle. \n\nTLDR: she should not have made her problem your problem, especially because she knows how long you like to spend at the gym, but you could have been a little more supportive of someone who was uncomfortable and struggling.", "NTA but if you are a frequent gym user, you could have encouraged her to just jump on a treadmill and walk for a bit or something.  \n\nI remember when I started going years ago, and it can be quite anxiety provoking for beginners.

Then she would know what to expect for the next time.", "Nta. She asked to train with you w which is an implicit agreement to follow your routine.

If she's trying to make positive changes in her life, she should be proud that she's taking steps to make progress.\n\nInstead though, she projected her insecurity.

It is difficult going to the gym and being overweight. She was probably thinking about all the people that would pass her sitting there and thinking to herself that they are laughing or something when in reality nobody cares everyone is there doing their own thing not paying attention to anyone. What is do when working out with someone who I know is not going to last as long as me is to meet there in the front to walk in together. That way when they are done they can leave and I can stay and finish up. I just make sure I am super encouraging while they are doing their thing. \n\nMaybe she only did 20 min because she did not know where to start. Did she have a plan or did she go in and try to figure it out as she went? If she didn't have a plan she may have been overwhelmed and got discouraged.
