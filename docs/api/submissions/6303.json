I asked to talk to her mom and told her she needs to buy a new xbox for her. She refused and told me she thinks this is a good consequence for her as she would play in front of them all day and wouldn't let her sibings touch the xbox which is why they took it without permission and accidently broke it. \n\nLast night I got another call from her telling me my daughter broke the kids new laptop on purpose. I asked my daughter what happened and she calmly told me her sibings didn't let her touch the laptop and she accidently broke it. I told my ex that this seems right to me. When something gets accidently broken no one needs to pay for it right? we decided on this last night. She blew up at me and called me an asshole and said I know very well that this was no accident. I told her I wish I could pay for the laptop but unfortunately I have a new xbox to buy and hung up the phone.

You aren't AH for not wanting to pay for the laptop since your Ex set up this weird idea that you don't pay for something broke at the other person's house. You do however have bigger problems here.\n\n1)Your Ex is trying to force your daughter to share with her step siblings when she doesn't want to; especially things you buy her. I get things can be hard when one sibling has something the other one doesn't but your daughter has a right to her belongings and shouldn't be forced to share when she doesn't want to. The step siblings should be taught to respect other people's stuff.\n\n2)Step siblings are deliberately breaking your daughter stuff and when it happens, your Ex is blaming your daughter and not the step siblings. At 13 & 8 I doubt it was a true accident. They were probably mad she wouldn't share and broke it on her. Even if it was an accident, it still wasn't your daughter's fault, she shouldn't be blamed and have to do without an Xbox..which is what your Ex wants to do..essentially your Ex wants to punish your daughter because of the step kids behavior.\n\n3)So your Ex doesn't think she has to replace the Xbox you bought for your Daughter that her kids broke yet she thinks you should have to fully replace the laptop your daughter broke .. so she never has to pay for her kids but you always have to pay 100% for yours? At best she should of only be asking you to replace half of something your daughter breaks .. since it is her daughter too .. she should be responsible to pay for her daughter too .. I could only see you being fully responsible if she broke something at your place. \n\n4)Your Ex just taught your Daughter a lesson that probably wasn't a good lesson to teach her. She just picked up on that her step siblings can do no wrong. She just picked up that if something is broke as an \"accident\" because the other \"siblings refuses to share\" there will be no punishment. So your Daughter turned the tables on your ex and step siblings and broke the laptop deliberately..she telling you it was an accident so she doesn't get in trouble and she knows it is twisting your Ex words around .. but make no mistake, she mad and upset that her step siblings broke her Xbox, they weren't being punished and her mother wasn't going to replace it...so she took maters into her own hands.\n\nPersonally I think the Karma looks good on your Ex. She didn't expect that your daughter would turn the tables and then you would use her words against her. I wouldn't pay for the laptop, I would replace the Xbox for your daughter if you can, I would also have a chat with your daughter.
