I asked to talk to her mom and told her she needs to buy a new xbox for her. She refused and told me she thinks this is a good consequence for her as she would play in front of them all day and wouldn't let her sibings touch the xbox which is why they took it without permission and accidently broke it. \n\nLast night I got another call from her telling me my daughter broke the kids new laptop on purpose. I asked my daughter what happened and she calmly told me her sibings didn't let her touch the laptop and she accidently broke it. I told my ex that this seems right to me. When something gets accidently broken no one needs to pay for it right? we decided on this last night. She blew up at me and called me an asshole and said I know very well that this was no accident. I told her I wish I could pay for the laptop but unfortunately I have a new xbox to buy and hung up the phone. She sent me more messages calling me an asshole(and so many other nice words) and said the laptop was a lot more expensive than the xbox", "created_utc": 1672678305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101h9rv/aita_for_not_paying_for_something_my_daughter/", "score": 595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
