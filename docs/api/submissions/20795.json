Both early 40s. Parents have been married for over 20 years and we've maintained a friendly, if not super close, relationship. \n\nLast year, my partner and I (M) moved to the same small city as SB and his gf, and my father and his wife. We all live within a few blocks of each other and get together for family dinners once a month.\n\nSB is the sort who makes you feel like you're his best friend when you get together. He'll sort of spring a hug on when he sees you and say things like \"I'm really glad you're here\" and \"We really should hang out soon.\"\n\nWe get along well at dinners, and were excited to be living in the same town, thinking it would bring us closer as friends.\n\nIt's been a year and we haven't actually hung out outside of these meals. We've made plans a few times, each time the day has rolled around we just haven't heard anything from them. SB is pretty busy, so I haven't called him out on this, but it has started to feel more like empty words and not actual interest. You wouldn't know this from when we see each other at these family dinners, as SB goes over the top in expressing how happy he is to have us living here.\n\nSo SB and gf recently got married. We knew it was going to happen this year because it's come up often at dinner. We were always under the impression that we were going to be invited. The wedding was held in another city across the country, but I told SB several times that we would definitely fly out for it and were excited. He reacted very positively to that.\n\nFast forward several months later, dad tells me he's going out of town for a week. \n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know... (Same city)\"\n\nWe're friends on FB and a few days later I'm seeing photos and videos of a big bash wedding. Rented church, reception, musicians, lots of people etc\n\nNo one told us about the wedding. I haven't heard from SB since.\n\nMy intent isn't to confront SB about how we were \"wronged\" by him. Happy for him and his wife and don't wish to bring any negativity into their lives.\n\nBut it does seem to me that this is a clear message that we're not as close as I imagined.\n\nI find it bewilderingly rude and hurtful.\n\nSo I explained to my dad that we felt hurt by this, and we don't wish to have anything more to do with SB or his wife. That means no more family dinners with all of us together.\n\nDad thinks I'm being unreasonable and doesn't want to be in the middle and I understand. I'm not upset with him, I just said we won't be getting together with SB again.\n\nAs far as I know, there has been no tension between us and SB. It feels more like he didn't see us as important enough to invite, not that there was a negative feeling about us.\n\nWe're kind of baffled. And we're human, with emotions, so yeah, this stung.\n\nAITA for not wanting to have anything more to do with SB?", "created_utc": 1687939086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l39cm/aita_for_cutting_off_stepbro_after_not_being/", "score": 864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, I have an issue with your whole family because of this. If your SB comes off as such a great family member, which you made it sound like, then he could\u2019ve explained to you why he couldn\u2019t invite you. Still would\u2019ve been a dick move on his part for not inviting you but at least he was man enough to say \u201chey the wedding party is getting bigger and bigger and since it\u2019s a destination wedding, I don\u2019t want to make you feel like you need to be there.\u201d Some type of excuse would\u2019ve been better than nothing.

And I\u2019m like what was that all about? and all of sudden the rest realized I was the only one of the group that wasn\u2019t invited on one of the guy\u2019s wedding. That hurt a lot tbh.

Your father is an arsehole too, why didn't he talk to you about any of this beforehand, especially as he obviously knew you weren't invited to the wedding? His behaviour suggests he was deceitful too, leaving it to the last minute to tell you he was going away for a week but not why. I'd be well-tempted to tell your father he is cut off too for this, it's cruel and totally unforgiveable in my book. You'd do well to move away from all of them.", "INFO: How big was this wedding?", "NTA. Some people are just fake to the core. I'm so sorry that your SB is one of them.

Nothing is ever going to change.", "Yeah he sounds like a used car salesman, or for the kids.... a MLM shill", "I appreciate your comment. OP has a character limit, but maybe I should mention that I have another SB in same family who also got married last year. We weren't invited to his wedding and didn't give it a second thought, because we've never been under the impression that we're close. \n\nWith this SB, it's his language and behavior that led us to believe we were. He calls me \"brother\" and brought up his wedding several times while it was still in preliminary planning, and always made it seem like we were going to be invited.\n\nI've previously stayed with him several times at his old place in another city when I was in the area.\n\nSo it's more this feeling of not wanting to have to go through this \"brother\" song and dance and pretend we are close over dinner. As you say, it doesn't feel like we are important to him, so it seems okay to not put anything back into it at this point and move on.", "Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply. I'm bad at Reddit (this is my first post ever), but I'm male and my partner is female. \n\nAnd yeah, that's how I felt about it. If he had just said that to me, it would have gone a long way. Instead we just sort of feel like we don't exist, and again, we're literally 4 blocks away from each other.", "I can think of times when that would matter. But in this case SB, SB's fiancee, and the father all knew that OP reasonably thought they'd be invited. If the guest list was tiny, fine but at least one of them should have told OP before the wedding took place. There's no size that makes it okay to jabber on week after week about wedding plans in front of someone, allowing them to believe they will be a participant, then do nothing to gently correct that impression. At least OP and partner hadn't already spent money on attire or tickets. That's one small blessing.", "They have dinner together every month and the dude pretends to be excited to see OP.", "Yeah sorry it was like that. I totally understand your betrayal.

However, SB is not an AH at all, and you are taking the snub too personally. \n\nWhy would you have been invited? You did not grow up together, and now, you are both in your 40s, with this being the first time you have had regular contact. In addition, this is not even organic contact, as you are meeting because of family. It should have told you all you need to know that he never hung out with you one on one and always canceled. SB was cordial at best with you, like a friendly neighbor. Sorry, but neighbors do not get invited to the wedding.\n\nYou were wrong to keep mentioning the party, as he never said you were invited. You just assumed and made an ass out of yourself, and things awkward for him.  \n\nNow you are going to cut him off, for no real reason. To be honest, you should just be cordial, while keeping it in the back of your mind that this is an acquaintance, at best. If you start all this drama and get your dad involved, well....You kind of show the world why he keeps you at a distance in the first place.", "Nta", "Not at all.

Those are two different things. \n\nLook, I think that youthought you were closer than you actually were. You're really not that close. Just be polite when you see him at social gatherings and don't expect any sort of real relationship.\n\nI think cutting him off completely because he's not giving you the relationship that you want is extreme.", "I wouldn't get salty but I'd accept that we aren't close and he's full of shit. I'd keep my distance. And to be honest, I wouldn't give your dad a pass either. He's a coward who follows the path of least resistance. And that path can lead him to his wife's kids because you should take a step back from him too.", "ESH. (edited) EDITED TO ADD:  I think it was wrong for the couple not to have explained in advance they weren\u2019t inviting them instead of just smiling when OP indicated they wanted to come. Maybe they were trying to avoid a confrontation over it. But in the end, that probably hurt OP\u2019s feelings even worse. So I\u2019m changing my vote to ESH. Original comment which I still agree with: You said yourself the only time you see these people is when you get together with other family members. You really aren\u2019t friends, so it\u2019s not surprising they didn\u2019t invite you. They have been very polite in how they have avoided a closer relationship, but clearly they aren\u2019t interested in one. So why are you acting as if they\u2019ve wronged you somehow? They\u2019ve been friendly and polite and you should treat them the same way in return and accept that they aren\u2019t interested in pursuing anything deeper. You have no reason to suddenly cut them off or be rude to them.", "NTA. Cutting off contact might seem extreme, but your feelings are valid. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.", "St", "INFO \nDid SB invite everyone else who comes to these family dinners? \n\nAlso I understand it hurts but I think you should have an adult conversation with him before assuming malicious intent , some people are friends with everyone and no one at the same time and I feel that may be the case with your SB.\n\nHe genuinely may be a nice person who treats everyone like a friend without actually considering those people his ACTUAL friends.", "NAH. The wording of the title makes it sound you were financially supporting him so I was expecting a N-T-A but it sounds like he's a decent guy and you just arent close. Nothing wrong with that. I have a lot of friendly acquaintances I like that I wouldnt invite to my wedding. \n\nGiven the way you described his personality, he's likely a popular guy, which means being pickier about who you invite who would be on the fringe list. You didn't grow up together so there's not really an obligation imo.\n\n  \nHe's done nothing wrong, but you're totally in your rights to not want a further relationship. I personally wouldnt hold resentment because Ive seen first hand how dramatic wedding planning is, but you do you.", "ESH.\n\nSB is allowed to invite whoever he wants to his wedding and OP is acting childish for wanting to cut off contact over it. The step brother title may be there but he clearly only sees OP as an acquaintance, just accept that that is the relationship instead of making it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the SB sounds like he could have handled it all better too.

SB was rude for not telling you ahead of time that you weren\u2019t invited. \n\nAs far as weddings go, no one is obligated to invite anyone. But it sounds like it was clear that you were under the impression that you were going. Which means he purposely omitted the fact that you weren\u2019t invited. \n\nWhat I find odd is that you say you discussed it frequently, and met for dinner once a month.\n\nHow did you *not* know when the wedding was? Wedding date is a very natural thing to come up in conversation when discussing a wedding. Its almost always the first decision that is made.

SB is that word used to describe a person who will say one thing in public and is actually 90 degrees in the opposite when in certain circles. The pattern of not spending time outside of those dinners would be a sign. People who like spending time with each other will find or make the time.

Then, on top of that, didn't invite you to the wedding.  I don't care about \"guest lists, budget, blah, blah, blah\" you're FAMILY, you get together monthly, he ACTS like he likes you, you should have been invited.  It's beyond rude that they left you off the guest list.\n\nETA I'm not sure if you're male or female, I only see a mention of your partner being male.  If you're also male, I'd wonder if they didn't invite you because they didn't want a gay couple at their wedding.  THAT would be reason enough to not only cut them off but also call them out.", "NTA, SBTA\u2026. Sounds like you dodged a bullet in saving your precious time, energy, and money going forward in the future.

Just living your life, making your decisions. Your dad wants you to play your little role in the stupid charade. Don't.", "NTA\n\nI mean, I assume you will be polite when you run into him.

Good to see you!\n\nFake dude, you need a beer?", "NTA, it makes me really uncomfortable when people talk like we are close and I know they don't mean it, and I imagine thinking they meant it then realising they didn't is horrible.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t consider you family, why do you need to do family dinners?", "Someone in his new family has a problem with gay people, and he didn't want to deal with correcting the bigots. Sorry fam.", "I understand being hurt, but honestly, with the info you provided, I wouldn't be offended.\n\nWeddings are difficult and expensive and stressful and sometimes there is A LOT of pressure around the guest list. Which means parents are DEMANDING great aunt Edna who you haven't seen in 10 yrs NEEDS to be invited and your aunt is calling you b/c you cousin didn't get a +1. \n\nDo you know the size of the wedding and who is payinging for it, because that can make a huge difference.\n\nDo you know the family dynamics involved? Examples: \"If we invite my Dad's step-kid then MIL will have a fit that her 3 step-children aren't invited\" or the classic \"Mom is throwing a fit I invited dad's wife, she will make a scene at the wedding if I invite his step-kid\"\n\nYou describe a relationship where you see each other when other people arrange it and where you get along well, but you have never actually excuted on getting together separately. That tells me that you don't have an established outside relationship at this time.\n\nI have many people that I really lik, have a great time with and care about, but we don't have a relationship separate from the one thing that brings us together (work or volunteer group, for example). It would be great to develop a closer, more personal relationship, but we just never put in the extra effort to do so. I wouldn't invite these people to my wedding unless the wedding was pretty large. \n\nNot making the cut doesn't mean you SB doesn't like/care about you nor does it mean he doesn't want  a closer relationship, it just means that there was a list, names had to be cut, and unfortunately, there is a lot more going into the list than just who you like and who you don't like.", "NTA.

Which is exhausting and unnecessary. He could have been cordial and not pretended your relationship was something it wasn't at these dinners. This way you probably wouldn't have blinked an eye at not being invited to his wedding. \n\nAnd your Dad obviously knew you weren't invited and played along, \"we're going this city\", deliberately not mentioning the wedding.

I think to get closure you should talk to your SB and just tell him that based on your conversations you thought your relationship was close, but after not being invited to the wedding you feel confused. You should be able to get more insight into his true feelings if you open with that, and you can decide from there if you\u2019d like to continue making an effort with the relationship, or if you decide to cut him off, you can let him know in that conversation.\n\nMy instinct is that your SB sounds very people-pleasing (as a recovering people-pleaser myself) and probably is holding onto some type of grudge that he is too scared to share. Hopefully this convo will help him be more honest with that, but there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll double down on acting like everything is good to avoid conflict. \n\nRegardless of how he responds though, I think by having an adult conversation you should be able to get some closure on this situation.

Makes sense.", "ESH\n\nExcept of the greetings and being overly friendly on family dinner, you guys had nothing to do with each others. You never met, you never went to an activity together, nothing. There was no indication you guys are close or even friends. \n\nBut the reason why you suck is bc with you not joining family dinner anymore you are punishing your dad, not your SB. Your SB will not care at all and still enjoy dinner with your dad. So your dad has to either have 2 dinners every month or leaving one of you out or he can convince your SB to (fake)apologise to you - what wouldn't change the fact that he still doesn't care. \n\nWhy not just correct the image you had of your rs with SB and continue going to the dinners - for your dad?", "NTA for realizing you\u2019re not close after all, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessary to avoid family dinners.

I would ask you though, if they're such a small part of your life as it is, is it worth all the negative energy to try and cut them out completely?

Like, you can still meet him at family gatherings and that might be nice if you feel it would, but keep in mind that when he suggests making plans, he\u2019s probably just being polite. But if you\u2019d rather cut contact, that\u2019s fine too.", "NTA. Though if it were me, I\u2019d show up at those meals and just monopolize the conversation over your wedding planning, etc. Then when the invites go out, make it clear they went out, and if he/his wife ever ask about their invite, act surprised and ask them \u201cWhy would you think you would be invited?\u201d and walk away. Petty, but satisfying.

I will say that to ur father u may be kinda an AH i say this bc he has nothing to do with the choices made by either of u two yet he will have to suffer for ur pride/hurt feelings...u could choose to still have a dinner with family and keep things cordial without bringing up the past and without pretending that u have some super close relationship, treat them respectfully but take no crap and let ur dad have a few more family meals while he's still able...life is too short to get hung up on our feelings even when they hurt really bad.
