Both early 40s. Parents have been married for over 20 years and we've maintained a friendly, if not super close, relationship. \n\nLast year, my partner and I (M) moved to the same small city as SB and his gf, and my father and his wife. We all live within a few blocks of each other and get together for family dinners once a month.\n\nSB is the sort who makes you feel like you're his best friend when you get together. He'll sort of spring a hug on when he sees you and say things like \"I'm really glad you're here\" and \"We really should hang out soon.\"\n\nWe get along well at dinners, and were excited to be living in the same town, thinking it would bring us closer as friends.\n\nIt's been a year and we haven't actually hung out outside of these meals. We've made plans a few times, each time the day has rolled around we just haven't heard anything from them. SB is pretty busy, so I haven't called him out on this, but it has started to feel more like empty words and not actual interest. You wouldn't know this from when we see each other at these family dinners, as SB goes over the top in expressing how happy he is to have us living here.\n\nSo SB and gf recently got married. We knew it was going to happen this year because it's come up often at dinner. We were always under the impression that we were going to be invited. The wedding was held in another city across the country, but I told SB several times that we would definitely fly out for it and were excited. He reacted very positively to that.\n\nFast forward several months later, dad tells me he's going out of town for a week. \n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know... (Same city)\"\n\nWe're friends on FB and a few days later I'm seeing photos and videos of a big bash wedding. Rented church, reception, musicians, lots of people etc\n\nNo one told us about the wedding. I haven't heard from SB since.\n\nMy intent isn't to confront SB about how we were \"wronged\" by him. Happy for him and his wife and don't wish to bring any negativity into their lives.\n\nBut it does seem to me that this is a clear message that we're not as close as I imagined.\n\nI find it bewilderingly rude and hurtful.\n\nSo I explained to my dad that we felt hurt by this, and we don't wish to have anything more to do with SB or his wife. That means no more family dinners with all of us together.\n\nDad thinks I'm being unreasonable and doesn't want to be in the middle and I understand. I'm not upset with him, I just said we won't be getting together with SB again.\n\nAs far as I know, there has been no tension between us and SB. It feels more like he didn't see us as important enough to invite, not that there was a negative feeling about us.\n\nWe're kind of baffled. And we're human, with emotions, so yeah, this stung.\n\nAITA for not wanting to have anything more to do with SB?", "created_utc": 1687939086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l39cm/aita_for_cutting_off_stepbro_after_not_being/", "score": 526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, I have an issue with your whole family because of this. If your SB comes off as such a great family member, which you made it sound like, then he could\u2019ve explained to you why he couldn\u2019t invite you. Still would\u2019ve been a dick move on his part for not inviting you but at least he was man enough to say \u201chey the wedding party is getting bigger and bigger and since it\u2019s a destination wedding, I don\u2019t want to make you feel like you need to be there.\u201d Some type of excuse would\u2019ve been better than nothing.

And I\u2019m like what was that all about? and all of sudden the rest realized I was the only one of the group that wasn\u2019t invited on one of the guy\u2019s wedding. That hurt a lot tbh.

Your father is an arsehole too, why didn't he talk to you about any of this beforehand, especially as he obviously knew you weren't invited to the wedding? His behaviour suggests he was deceitful too, leaving it to the last minute to tell you he was going away for a week but not why. I'd be well-tempted to tell your father he is cut off too for this, it's cruel and totally unforgiveable in my book. You'd do well to move away from all of them.", "INFO: How big was this wedding?", "NTA. Some people are just fake to the core. I'm so sorry that your SB is one of them.

Nothing is ever going to change.", "Yeah he sounds like a used car salesman, or for the kids.... a MLM shill", "I appreciate your comment. OP has a character limit, but maybe I should mention that I have another SB in same family who also got married last year. We weren't invited to his wedding and didn't give it a second thought, because we've never been under the impression that we're close. \n\nWith this SB, it's his language and behavior that led us to believe we were. He calls me \"brother\" and brought up his wedding several times while it was still in preliminary planning, and always made it seem like we were going to be invited.\n\nI've previously stayed with him several times at his old place in another city when I was in the area.\n\nSo it's more this feeling of not wanting to have to go through this \"brother\" song and dance and pretend we are close over dinner. As you say, it doesn't feel like we are important to him, so it seems okay to not put anything back into it at this point and move on.", "Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply. I'm bad at Reddit (this is my first post ever), but I'm male and my partner is female. \n\nAnd yeah, that's how I felt about it. If he had just said that to me, it would have gone a long way. Instead we just sort of feel like we don't exist, and again, we're literally 4 blocks away from each other.", "I can think of times when that would matter. But in this case SB, SB's fiancee, and the father all knew that OP reasonably thought they'd be invited. If the guest list was tiny, fine but at least one of them should have told OP before the wedding took place. There's no size that makes it okay to jabber on week after week about wedding plans in front of someone, allowing them to believe they will be a participant, then do nothing to gently correct that impression. At least OP and partner hadn't already spent money on attire or tickets. That's one small blessing.", "They have dinner together every month and the dude pretends to be excited to see OP.", "Yeah sorry it was like that. I totally understand your betrayal.

However, SB is not an AH at all, and you are taking the snub too personally. \n\nWhy would you have been invited? You did not grow up together, and now, you are both in your 40s, with this being the first time you have had regular contact. In addition, this is not even organic contact, as you are meeting because of family. It should have told you all you need to know that he never hung out with you one on one and always canceled. SB was cordial at best with you, like a friendly neighbor. Sorry, but neighbors do not get invited to the wedding.\n\nYou were wrong to keep mentioning the party, as he never said you were invited. You just assumed and made an ass out of yourself, and things awkward for him.  \n\nNow you are going to cut him off, for no real reason. To be honest, you should just be cordial, while keeping it in the back of your mind that this is an acquaintance, at best. If you start all this drama and get your dad involved, well....You kind of show the world why he keeps you at a distance in the first place.", "Nta", "Not at all.

Those are two different things. \n\nLook, I think that youthought you were closer than you actually were. You're really not that close. Just be polite when you see him at social gatherings and don't expect any sort of real relationship.\n\nI think cutting him off completely because he's not giving you the relationship that you want is extreme.", "I wouldn't get salty but I'd accept that we aren't close and he's full of shit. I'd keep my distance. And to be honest, I wouldn't give your dad a pass either. He's a coward who follows the path of least resistance. And that path can lead him to his wife's kids because you should take a step back from him too.", "ESH. (edited) EDITED TO ADD:  I think it was wrong for the couple not to have explained in advance they weren\u2019t inviting them instead of just smiling when OP indicated they wanted to come. Maybe they were trying to avoid a confrontation over it. But in the end, that probably hurt OP\u2019s feelings even worse. So I\u2019m changing my vote to ESH. Original comment which I still agree with: You said yourself the only time you see these people is when you get together with other family members. You really aren\u2019t friends, so it\u2019s not surprising they didn\u2019t invite you. They have been very polite in how they have avoided a closer relationship, but clearly they aren\u2019t interested in one. So why are you acting as if they\u2019ve wronged you somehow? They\u2019ve been friendly and polite and you should treat them the same way in return and accept that they aren\u2019t interested in pursuing anything deeper. You have no reason to suddenly cut them off or be rude to them.", "NTA. Cutting off contact might seem extreme, but your feelings are valid. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being.", "St", "INFO \nDid SB invite everyone else who comes to these family dinners? \n\nAlso I understand it hurts but I think you should have an adult conversation with him before assuming malicious intent , some people are friends with everyone and no one at the same time and I feel that may be the case with your SB.\n\nHe genuinely may be a nice person who treats everyone like a friend without actually considering those people his ACTUAL friends.", "NAH. The wording of the title makes it sound you were financially supporting him so I was expecting a N-T-A but it sounds like he's a decent guy and you just arent close. Nothing wrong with that. I have a lot of friendly acquaintances I like that I wouldnt invite to my wedding. \n\nGiven the way you described his personality, he's likely a popular guy, which means being pickier about who you invite who would be on the fringe list. You didn't grow up together so there's not really an obligation imo.\n\n  \nHe's done nothing wrong, but you're totally in your rights to not want a further relationship. I personally wouldnt hold resentment because Ive seen first hand how dramatic wedding planning is, but you do you.", "ESH.\n\nSB is allowed to invite whoever he wants to his wedding and OP is acting childish for wanting to cut off contact over it. The step brother title may be there but he clearly only sees OP as an acquaintance, just accept that that is the relationship instead of making it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, the SB sounds like he could have handled it all better too. OP assumed they were invited and SB should have had the guts to tell them they weren't.

SB was rude for not telling you ahead of time that you weren\u2019t invited. \n\nAs far as weddings go, no one is obligated to invite anyone. But it sounds like it was clear that you were under the impression that you were going. Which means he purposely omitted the fact that you weren\u2019t invited. \n\nWhat I find odd is that you say you discussed it frequently, and met for dinner once a month.\n\nHow did you *not* know when the wedding was? Wedding date is a very natural thing to come up in conversation when discussing a wedding. Its almost always the first decision that is made.

SB is that word used to describe a person who will say one thing in public and is actually 90 degrees in the opposite when in certain circles. The pattern of not spending time outside of those dinners would be a sign. People who like spending time with each other will find or make the time.

Then, on top of that, didn't invite you to the wedding.  I don't care about \"guest lists, budget, blah, blah, blah\" you're FAMILY, you get together monthly, he ACTS like he likes you, you should have been invited.  It's beyond rude that they left you off the guest list.\n\nETA I'm not sure if you're male or female, I only see a mention of your partner being male.  If you're also male, I'd wonder if they didn't invite you because they didn't want a gay couple at their wedding.  THAT would be reason enough to not only cut them off but also call them out.", "NTA, SBTA\u2026. Sounds like you dodged a bullet in saving your precious time, energy, and money going forward in the future.

You made the right decision.\n\nEdit: your dad is an asshole too for making you feel like you are doing something bad to him and 'putting him in the middle'. You are not doing anything bad to him. Just living your life, making your decisions. Your dad wants you to play your little role in the stupid charade. Don't.", "NTA\n\nI mean, I assume you will be polite when you run into him.

Good to see you!\n\nFake dude, you need a beer?", "NTA, it makes me really uncomfortable when people talk like we are close and I know they don't mean it, and I imagine thinking they meant it then realising they didn't is horrible.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t consider you family, why do you need to do family dinners?", "Someone in his new family has a problem with gay people, and he didn't want to deal with correcting the bigots. Sorry fam.", "I understand being hurt, but honestly, with the info you provided, I wouldn't be offended.\n\nWeddings are difficult and expensive and stressful and sometimes there is A LOT of pressure around the guest list. Which means parents are DEMANDING great aunt Edna who you haven't seen in 10 yrs NEEDS to be invited and your aunt is calling you b/c you cousin didn't get a +1. \n\nDo you know the size of the wedding and who is payinging for it, because that can make a huge difference.\n\nDo you know the family dynamics involved? Examples: \"If we invite my Dad's step-kid then MIL will have a fit that her 3 step-children aren't invited\" or the classic \"Mom is throwing a fit I invited dad's wife, she will make a scene at the wedding if I invite his step-kid\"\n\nYou describe a relationship where you see each other when other people arrange it and where you get along well, but you have never actually excuted on getting together separately. That tells me that you don't have an established outside relationship at this time.\n\nI have many people that I really lik, have a great time with and care about, but we don't have a relationship separate from the one thing that brings us together (work or volunteer group, for example). It would be great to develop a closer, more personal relationship, but we just never put in the extra effort to do so. I wouldn't invite these people to my wedding unless the wedding was pretty large. \n\nNot making the cut doesn't mean you SB doesn't like/care about you nor does it mean he doesn't want  a closer relationship, it just means that there was a list, names had to be cut, and unfortunately, there is a lot more going into the list than just who you like and who you don't like.", "NTA.  It's not like he wants to have anything to do with you.  Sounds like he's playing the 'be civil' line everybody tells people to be.", "NTA. I had a friend I was once extremely close with not even tell me he was getting married, much less invite me to the event. I was hurt when I found out and we drifted apart as a result. I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from here.", "Good point. Dad was 100% in on it.", "Therefore, you do not have a familiar relationship and you really shouldn't use your time on that person.", "This was a very hurtful thing SB did to you, and obviously he's full of shit.", "Damn, that really sucks. I hope you managed to get some friends who have your back. It\u2019s never the quantity, but the quality of friends. One true friend is better than a thousand acquaintances.", "They were the ones cut off, not inviting them to the wedding severed the relationship.  And they haven't been rude whatsoever, not going to events where someone else is isn't at all rude and they said nothing to these people about not being invited. Your lecture is definitely way off base and that's why you are severely downvoted.", "You are really reaching here.  They are family, even if they aren't close, you invite family to weddings, especially those who you think of as friends.  His Dad is an absolute coward who knew he wasn't being invited to the wedding yet said nothing and your lecture is hilariously bad which is why everyone downvoted it.  Cutting off someone who isn't your friend but acted like they were is plenty reason enough.  And it's not Drama whatsoever to simply not interact with someone.  Please never give advice again.", "How does OP suck though, they are accepting of that.\nAcquaintances don't get regular intimate family dinners.", "Have you talked directly to him about this?", "He doesn't want to get in the middle of it because he's already on one side. Hint: it's not OP's.", "Therefore, you do not have a familiar relationship and you really shouldn't use your time on that person.", "Therefore, you do not have a familiar relationship and you really shouldn't use your time on that person.", "My take is all his warmth at the monthly dinners was merely putting on a show for an audience of two - your father and stepmom.", "Don\u2019t talk to him about it, it will just make it worse low or no contact is best. I doubt he will even care. Save yourself heartache and just ignore him and stay away. Might go low contact with dad also because he doesn\u2019t care much for you either", "I don\u2019t mind being down voted. This couple was under no obligation to invite the OP to their wedding. I think it was wrong for them not to have explained in advance they weren\u2019t inviting them instead of just smiling when OP indicated they wanted to come. I suppose they were trying to avoid a confrontation over it. But in the end, that probably hurt OP\u2019s feelings even worse.", "Some people consider step family family, some people dont. Most people I know who do, do because they grew up together. Its not uncommon for people who's parents get married after they've grown up to think of them more as \"My mom's husband's son\" than a stepbrother. It sounds like they just weren't that close. \n\nI dont think OP needs to keep going to the dinners, but the person who got married didnt do anything wrong.", "\"accepting that\" would mean the OP continues doing the family dinner and enjoying the friendly relationship that they have with their SB - even if that relationship is just a casual one. These family dinners don't sound like it's just for OP and SB but it's time for their parents to see them too.\n\nWhat OP wants is to cut off contact with the SB and no longer go to the dinner that they are actually invited to. Basically taking their ball and going home instead of being adults about it.", "Ummmmm, you know this is Reddit where 99.9% of posts wouldn't happen if people were adults and communicated openly with each other.", "But then why invite them to the wedding but not OP, if he's that concerned what they think?", "Tbh, it is an unspoken social cue that when you aren't invited, they just smile politely and are vague with the details. You, then deduce you aren't invited. OP can't be this naive.", "For real. I had no idea what the guy before was talking about, but he seemed pretty angry and bitter, so chose not to engage.", "If you hold people at arms length, you have to accept the distance. You can pick and choose who you are close with but you can't force them to consent to the relationship being any closer than that. They are free to choose their wedding guests, and OP is free to choose who they dine with.", "I feel like the hole \"cutting off\" verbiage is weirdly dramatic. It makes it sound like OP has been paying the guys bills and then was snubbed for the wedding. When really they just were friendly acquaintances who's middle aged parents got married to each other.", "It's just an ego trip. People cannot stand not being invited, so she is in her feelings and being unreasonable. The SB owes her nothing."]}
