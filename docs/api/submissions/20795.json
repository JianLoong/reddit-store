Both early 40s. Parents have been married for over 20 years and we've maintained a friendly, if not super close, relationship. \n\nLast year, my partner and I (M) moved to the same small city as SB and his gf, and my father and his wife. We all live within a few blocks of each other and get together for family dinners once a month.\n\nSB is the sort who makes you feel like you're his best friend when you get together. He'll sort of spring a hug on when he sees you and say things like \"I'm really glad you're here\" and \"We really should hang out soon.\"\n\nWe get along well at dinners, and were excited to be living in the same town, thinking it would bring us closer as friends.\n\nIt's been a year and we haven't actually hung out outside of these meals. We've made plans a few times, each time the day has rolled around we just haven't heard anything from them. SB is pretty busy, so I haven't called him out on this, but it has started to feel more like empty words and not actual interest. You wouldn't know this from when we see each other at these family dinners, as SB goes over the top in expressing how happy he is to have us living here.\n\nSo SB and gf recently got married. We knew it was going to happen this year because it's come up often at dinner. We were always under the impression that we were going to be invited. The wedding was held in another city across the country, but I told SB several times that we would definitely fly out for it and were excited. He reacted very positively to that.\n\nFast forward several months later, dad tells me he's going out of town for a week. \n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know... (Same city)\"\n\nWe're friends on FB and a few days later I'm seeing photos and videos of a big bash wedding. Rented church, reception, musicians, lots of people etc\n\nNo one told us about the wedding. I haven't heard from SB since.\n\nMy intent isn't to confront SB about how we were \"wronged\" by him. Happy for him and his wife and don't wish to bring any negativity into their lives.\n\nBut it does seem to me that this is a clear message that we're not as close as I imagined.\n\nI find it bewilderingly rude and hurtful.\n\nSo I explained to my dad that we felt hurt by this, and we don't wish to have anything more to do with SB or his wife. That means no more family dinners with all of us together.\n\nDad thinks I'm being unreasonable and doesn't want to be in the middle and I understand. I'm not upset with him, I just said we won't be getting together with SB again.\n\nAs far as I know, there has been no tension between us and SB. It feels more like he didn't see us as important enough to invite, not that there was a negative feeling about us.\n\nWe're kind of baffled. And we're human, with emotions, so yeah, this stung.\n\nAITA for not wanting to have anything more to do with SB?", "created_utc": 1687939086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l39cm/aita_for_cutting_off_stepbro_after_not_being/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He knew but didn't bother to break to to you kindly you were not invited. He deliberately dodged answering the question when you asked where he was going and let you find out on Facebook. They are all AH.", "NTA. It's clear that your SB didn't think much of you to invite to one of the biggest moments of his life. You get the message. I agree with your conclusion.", "NTA - your SB kinda sounds like a douchey fake friend. I understand that your hurt because you weren\u2019t invited to the wedding but I would have more of an issue with him not even telling you about the upcoming wedding. Honestly, I have an issue with your whole family because of this. If your SB comes off as such a great family member, which you made it sound like, then he could\u2019ve explained to you why he couldn\u2019t invite you. Still would\u2019ve been a dick move on his part for not inviting you but at least he was man enough to say \u201chey the wedding party is getting bigger and bigger and since it\u2019s a destination wedding, I don\u2019t want to make you feel like you need to be there.\u201d Some type of excuse would\u2019ve been better than nothing. Also, forgive me if I missed it, but are you male or female? I saw you mentioned your partner is male, so if your male could this be your SB problem with you?", "NTA \n\nNot inviting you to the wedding gives a clear signal that your SB does not see you as a close relative or friend.\n\nI\u2019ve had about the same experience where I\u2019m in a friend group of about 10-15 people who has seen each other every week for years and years playing games or just hanging out and stuff.\n\nOne day we all gathered for a game of DnD and before we started every one was talking how awesome time they had the day before. And I\u2019m like what was that all about? and all of sudden the rest realized I was the only one of the group that wasn\u2019t invited on one of the guy\u2019s wedding. That hurt a lot tbh. It was over ten years ago and thinking about it now it still stings.

It's patently clear that your stepbrother is lying and deceitful, I'd be staying well away from him and never believing another word he ever said. Your father is an arsehole too, why didn't he talk to you about any of this beforehand, especially as he obviously knew you weren't invited to the wedding? His behaviour suggests he was deceitful too, leaving it to the last minute to tell you he was going away for a week but not why. I'd be well-tempted to tell your father he is cut off too for this, it's cruel and totally unforgiveable in my book. You'd do well to move away from all of them.", "INFO: How big was this wedding?", "NTA. Some people are just fake to the core. I'm so sorry that your SB is one of them.

Nothing is ever going to change.", "Yeah he sounds like a used car salesman, or for the kids.... a MLM shill", "I appreciate your comment. OP has a character limit, but maybe I should mention that I have another SB in same family who also got married last year. We weren't invited to his wedding and didn't give it a second thought, because we've never been under the impression that we're close. \n\nWith this SB, it's his language and behavior that led us to believe we were. He calls me \"brother\" and brought up his wedding several times while it was still in preliminary planning, and always made it seem like we were going to be invited.\n\nI've previously stayed with him several times at his old place in another city when I was in the area.\n\nSo it's more this feeling of not wanting to have to go through this \"brother\" song and dance and pretend we are close over dinner. As you say, it doesn't feel like we are important to him, so it seems okay to not put anything back into it at this point and move on.", "Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply. I'm bad at Reddit (this is my first post ever), but I'm male and my partner is female. \n\nAnd yeah, that's how I felt about it. If he had just said that to me, it would have gone a long way. Instead we just sort of feel like we don't exist, and again, we're literally 4 blocks away from each other.", "I can think of times when that would matter. But in this case SB, SB's fiancee, and the father all knew that OP reasonably thought they'd be invited. If the guest list was tiny, fine but at least one of them should have told OP before the wedding took place. There's no size that makes it okay to jabber on week after week about wedding plans in front of someone, allowing them to believe they will be a participant, then do nothing to gently correct that impression. At least OP and partner hadn't already spent money on attire or tickets. That's one small blessing.", "They have dinner together every month and the dude pretends to be excited to see OP.", "Yeah sorry it was like that. I totally understand your betrayal. Even if this SB was just trying to be civil with you, why mention about the wedding that you aren't gonna be invited?", "NTA\n\nDid your Dad go to the wedding?  \nYour father \"wanting to stay out of it\", he's already in the middle of it having kept the knowledge the wedding was taking place where & when. He has no place to say you are being unreasonable.", "Your dad is TA along with SB but not you OP.\n\nYou are NTA here.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t bother, why would you?", "I would be pissed at your dad for the lies he told you about his trip\u2026 he knew what was going on and was also part of it. I would rethink the closeness you have with these people, and probably stop my weekly visits\u2026. For good! Your Not The Ass! However your brother and dad are!!!", "NTA. If they don\u2019t consider you a priority, you certainly do not have to consider them one.", "I really, *really* hate it when people who have the power to make a difference say they don't want to be in the middle. They are *already* in the middle because they *chose* to be silent about something.", "Nope, NTA.  Step brother is not interested in a relationship fir whatever reason so spend your time with people who enjoy your company. Dad is the unreasonable one for thinking that actions shouldn't have consequences.", "YTA.\n\nThe truth is your feelings are hurt, and that is okay. However, SB is not an AH at all, and you are taking the snub too personally. \n\nWhy would you have been invited? You did not grow up together, and now, you are both in your 40s, with this being the first time you have had regular contact. In addition, this is not even organic contact, as you are meeting because of family. It should have told you all you need to know that he never hung out with you one on one and always canceled. SB was cordial at best with you, like a friendly neighbor. Sorry, but neighbors do not get invited to the wedding.\n\nYou were wrong to keep mentioning the party, as he never said you were invited. You just assumed and made an ass out of yourself, and things awkward for him.  \n\nNow you are going to cut him off, for no real reason. To be honest, you should just be cordial, while keeping it in the back of your mind that this is an acquaintance, at best. If you start all this drama and get your dad involved, well....You kind of show the world why he keeps you at a distance in the first place.", "Nta", "Not at all.  There are a million ways sb could have handled it, and he opted not to even tell you he was getting married.  That is shitty and feels shitty.  \n\nWhen people tell you who they are believe them.", "NTA\n\nYea, no, SB's behaviour is really weird.\nSounds like he's been putting on a deliberate show in front of your dad and stepmom to seem like a really good brother or something. But then he never actually meant any of it. Because if he did, those hangouts would have happened. Really. Really. Weird.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to hang around someone that was clearly acting fake and pretending like we're closer than we are.", "Do you get along with the GF, now wife? The new spouse not wanting somebody there has been known to happen. I would back away as you suggested unless SB comes and tells you something.", "NTA.  His actions clearly demonstrated where you stand and your father should have been honest and upfront about the whole thing.  If your father wants a relationship with you he can have it outside the dinners and you have no other obligation.  Sorry but your dad sounds like an AH.", "LOL, NTA OP.\n\nTell your dad he lost that right to not be in the middle the MOMENT he told you he was going away, and \"forgot\" to mention why. Please, do NOT let him act like he didn't make a choice.", "NTA -  but move in silence next time, like your SB!", "NTA- You thought you had a family relationship because he's always cordial.  You weren't invited to a big family event.  You weren't even told about not being invited for whatever reason.\n\nTherefore, you do not have a familiar relationship and you really shouldn't use your time on that person.  They're just the child of your father's spouse.", "NTA exactly. there wasn't a brew up. no big fight. he just didn't bother. You just do the same. no fight, no argument , no accusations. no nothing. you tried to be friends, he's made it clear how he feels. don't give him another minute of your time.", "[removed]", "He's gotta be the biggest coward and AH here, too.\n\n\"I don't want to get in the middle of it,\" even though he went along with SBs plan all along & aided the situation by continuing to lie to you. \n\nWho are these dinners for? The only person benefiting from them are dad. I'd put dad on a low contact info diet.", "They wouldn\u2019t be seeing me come around to visit anymore\u2026 the Dad is the BIGGEST ASSHOLE! He straight up lied. That would be enough for me to say - GFO!
