My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I\u2019ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can\u2019t have kids so they\u2019ve always said I\u2019m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I\u2019m 21 now.\n\nMy sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn\u2019t want to so he told them that I wasn\u2019t available at the moment.\n\nThey finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d They said \u201cWe\u2019re your parents!\u201d and I said \u201cMy parents are at home.\u201d and went and sat down with my gran.

I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d\n\nMy gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.

You're my f'ing hero. Most people would freeze in the moment \u2014 ESPECIALLY when already preoccupied with grief and sadness \u2014 and only think of the perfect line minutes, hours, or days later.

Relationships are built on trust, and they broke that well and truly.", "NTA.  You're right.  That was just your dad's brother.", "They could have kept in contact the entire time. Phone calls, letters, emails,etc. This is on them.", "NTA. Good parents do their best to do right by all their children. They stopped being your parents when they left you with your grandparents.

Well done! Glad you have REAL parents, and I\u2019m not talking the bio ones", "Nta at all. They can't trash you like yesterday's left overs and expect you to care about them \n\nI was the sick kid.

I'm glad you have lovely parents ( aunt / uncle ) and that they took you in when your parents failed at their most important job. \n\nThey don't get to have you back in their life now that it's convenient to them.", "NTA! You were abandoned. They literally abandoned you. They don\u2019t deserve a second thought from you and you were right to back away from them. They aren\u2019t your parents.

I'm pretty proud of you for pulling off the cut direct (been reading a lot of Jane Austen recently lol)!

They gave you life long trauma and expect you not to be harsh?", "NTA, they are no longer your parents. Even legally since you're adopted now. Don't let them use you as a \"do over\", now that your sister died. They would'nt contacted you if she was still alive...", "NTA OP! Gran is right! They didn't even tell you what was happening! They don't deserve to be angry. They don't deserve you, either.", "NTA- A sick child is not a reason to literally abandon your other child. Bringing someone into the world doesn\u2019t make you a parent. The fact that they thought even for a second that you were serious about not knowing who they were tells me that they weren\u2019t around enough. A phone call once a week would have been something. The fact that they ignored you are years means they lose any right to call you their child.", "NTA. Your parents is your aunt and uncle. The sperm and egg donar is not. It's great you had people that was willing to step up and take the responsibility. Your aunt and uncle are truly amazing people. As for the donors, you handled it perfectly.", "NTA, they are only trying to reconnect with you because your \u2018sibling\u2019 died. Honestly, I wish I had the balls to do something like that because I totally would if I were in your situation. Your \u2018parents\u2019 should\u2019ve realized that they can\u2019t just expect you to want to talk to them again, especially since it wouldn\u2019t have happened if your sister was still alive.", "NTA\n\nThey are receiving the relationship they've earned.", "NTA\n\nThey don't get to completely abandon you and then think they can just waltz back into your life like nothing happened. Now that they're childless, they think they can just pick up where they left off, but it doesn't work that way.", "that was an incredible way to handle that! Totally NTA.  Really, what else could you do?", "NTA\nYour parents didn't try to contact you first after you were 12 and didn't bother till after the passing of your sister(sorry for your loss). If that didn't happen I doubt they would of ever noticed you. (This sounds mean and by no way do I mean it like that)", "Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha. \n\nLove you for this!\n\nTake your own power back!\n\nYou have parents. They adopted you! I\u2019m assuming your parents blocked the adoption before you were 18 but didn\u2019t see you, didn\u2019t finance you, didn\u2019t do anything for you!\n\nBut wanted a kid to replace the kid they lost!\n\nThat\u2019s not how kids and parents work!\n\nYou gotta be there for the small stuff to get to enjoy the big stuff!\n\nYou did well!\n\nNTA at all. Not one bit!", "NTA. The pettiness is definitely strong in you and I loved your response, but I don't think you're an ass for it. You're also grieving the loss of a sister and with the trauma you experienced growing up, I'm sure it's compounded by the reality that your \"parents\" treated you like they didn't want you.", "NTA - Your response to them was brilliant, cutting out any unnecessary dialog and letting them know how unimportant they are to you all at the same time.", "NTA. They are your sperm and egg donors. You Aunt and Uncle are your true parents. They abandoned you when you were growing up. They don't get to become parents once the focus of attention (and I am sorry for your loss) is no longer there. There was no reason why they couldn't have kept in touch.", "NTA. \n\n>and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.\n\nThey wanna bet on that? Lol", "NTA. that must have been such a traumatic experience to go through as a child, and throughout your life. the fact that they tried just now to be back in your life and take no responsibility or accountability shows their true colors. you made the best decision for you and there should be no shame in that.", "NTA. Good on you. Atleast you acknowledged their presence. I can't say I would've so props to you on that", "NTA. Good for you. Just because you share blood doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re family. You have every right to not want to be in their life.", "NTA. And you can too change who your parents are. You just did! One thing is that they couldn't cope with two children, one of which was very ill. That is a tragedy, but it does not explain why they never told you the reason why, or reached out to you through all those years. I wouldn't blame you at all for sticking with your adoptive parents in future. Your bio parents don't deserve you.", "NTA\n\nInstead of complaining about how hurt they are, they should get it through their heads about how hurt *you* were, and still are, at being dumped and ignored for 15 years. They seem to entirely lack empathy. \n\nYou owe them nothing. I'm so glad you have a loving family.", "NTA - They abandoned you.  They deserved it.  And usually I would say don't go low.", "NTA.  They abandoned you and ignored you for years.  Now that your sister is dead they need their \"son\" back.  A lot too late.  They didn't even apologize for dumping you as a small child on your relatives.  Its all about them.", "NTA, this is perfection and I love that you got to do this.", "The more I read of the same types of situations on this sub of parents abandoning a kid when the other is sick and then trying to get back into the kid's life when the sick one dies, the more I am certain a lot of people shouldn't have been allowed to have kids.", "I love Aunt and Uncle for the misrouted stork story.  I'm so glad you got the parents you actually deserve!  NTA", ">My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened\n\nYup. They don't get to just swoop back in like your their backup child\n\n>they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that\n\nOops, to late, you already DID", "NTA.
