I think I remember you from when I was little.\u201d\n\nMy gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.

They don't deserve to be angry. They don't deserve you, either.", "NTA- A sick child is not a reason to literally abandon your other child. Bringing someone into the world doesn\u2019t make you a parent. The fact that they thought even for a second that you were serious about not knowing who they were tells me that they weren\u2019t around enough. A phone call once a week would have been something. The fact that they ignored you are years means they lose any right to call you their child.", "NTA. Your parents is your aunt and uncle. The sperm and egg donar is not.

Really, what else could you do?", "NTA\nYour parents didn't try to contact you first after you were 12 and didn't bother till after the passing of your sister(sorry for your loss).

I\u2019m assuming your parents blocked the adoption before you were 18 but didn\u2019t see you, didn\u2019t finance you, didn\u2019t do anything for you!\n\nBut wanted a kid to replace the kid they lost!\n\nThat\u2019s not how kids and parents work!\n\nYou gotta be there for the small stuff to get to enjoy the big stuff!\n\nYou did well!\n\nNTA at all. Not one bit!", "NTA. The pettiness is definitely strong in you and I loved your response, but I don't think you're an ass for it. You're also grieving the loss of a sister and with the trauma you experienced growing up, I'm sure it's compounded by the reality that your \"parents\" treated you like they didn't want you.", "NTA - Your response to them was brilliant, cutting out any unnecessary dialog and letting them know how unimportant they are to you all at the same time.", "NTA. They are your sperm and egg donors. You Aunt and Uncle are your true parents. They abandoned you when you were growing up. They don't get to become parents once the focus of attention (and I am sorry for your loss) is no longer there. There was no reason why they couldn't have kept in touch.", "NTA. \n\n>and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.\n\nThey wanna bet on that? Lol", "NTA. that must have been such a traumatic experience to go through as a child, and throughout your life. the fact that they tried just now to be back in your life and take no responsibility or accountability shows their true colors. you made the best decision for you and there should be no shame in that.", "NTA. Good on you. Atleast you acknowledged their presence. I can't say I would've so props to you on that", "NTA. Good for you. Just because you share blood doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re family. You have every right to not want to be in their life.", "NTA. And you can too change who your parents are. You just did! One thing is that they couldn't cope with two children, one of which was very ill. That is a tragedy, but it does not explain why they never told you the reason why, or reached out to you through all those years. I wouldn't blame you at all for sticking with your adoptive parents in future. Your bio parents don't deserve you.", "NTA\n\nInstead of complaining about how hurt they are, they should get it through their heads about how hurt *you* were, and still are, at being dumped and ignored for 15 years. They seem to entirely lack empathy. \n\nYou owe them nothing. I'm so glad you have a loving family.", "NTA - They abandoned you.  They deserved it.  And usually I would say don't go low.", "NTA.  They abandoned you and ignored you for years.  Now that your sister is dead they need their \"son\" back.  A lot too late.  They didn't even apologize for dumping you as a small child on your relatives.  Its all about them.", "NTA, this is perfection and I love that you got to do this.", "The more I read of the same types of situations on this sub of parents abandoning a kid when the other is sick and then trying to get back into the kid's life when the sick one dies, the more I am certain a lot of people shouldn't have been allowed to have kids.", "I love Aunt and Uncle for the misrouted stork story.  I'm so glad you got the parents you actually deserve!  NTA", ">My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened\n\nYup.
