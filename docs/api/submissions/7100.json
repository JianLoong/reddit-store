They don't deserve to be angry. They don't deserve you, either.", "NTA- A sick child is not a reason to literally abandon your other child. Bringing someone into the world doesn\u2019t make you a parent. The fact that they thought even for a second that you were serious about not knowing who they were tells me that they weren\u2019t around enough. A phone call once a week would have been something.

I\u2019m assuming your parents blocked the adoption before you were 18 but didn\u2019t see you, didn\u2019t finance you, didn\u2019t do anything for you!\n\nBut wanted a kid to replace the kid they lost!\n\nThat\u2019s not how kids and parents work!\n\nYou gotta be there for the small stuff to get to enjoy the big stuff!\n\nYou did well!\n\nNTA at all. Not one bit!", "NTA. The pettiness is definitely strong in you and I loved your response, but I don't think you're an ass for it. You're also grieving the loss of a sister and with the trauma you experienced growing up, I'm sure it's compounded by the reality that your \"parents\" treated you like they didn't want you.", "NTA - Your response to them was brilliant, cutting out any unnecessary dialog and letting them know how unimportant they are to you all at the same time.", "NTA. They are your sperm and egg donors. You Aunt and Uncle are your true parents. They abandoned you when you were growing up. They don't get to become parents once the focus of attention (and I am sorry for your loss) is no longer there.

Lol", "NTA. that must have been such a traumatic experience to go through as a child, and throughout your life. the fact that they tried just now to be back in your life and take no responsibility or accountability shows their true colors. you made the best decision for you and there should be no shame in that.", "NTA. Good on you. Atleast you acknowledged their presence. I can't say I would've so props to you on that", "NTA. Good for you. Just because you share blood doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re family. You have every right to not want to be in their life.", "NTA. And you can too change who your parents are. You just did! One thing is that they couldn't cope with two children, one of which was very ill. That is a tragedy, but it does not explain why they never told you the reason why, or reached out to you through all those years. I wouldn't blame you at all for sticking with your adoptive parents in future. Your bio parents don't deserve you.", "NTA\n\nInstead of complaining about how hurt they are, they should get it through their heads about how hurt *you* were, and still are, at being dumped and ignored for 15 years. They seem to entirely lack empathy. \n\nYou owe them nothing. I'm so glad you have a loving family.", "NTA - They abandoned you.  They deserved it.  And usually I would say don't go low.", "NTA.  They abandoned you and ignored you for years.  Now that your sister is dead they need their \"son\" back.  A lot too late.  They didn't even apologize for dumping you as a small child on your relatives.  Its all about them.", "NTA, this is perfection and I love that you got to do this.", "The more I read of the same types of situations on this sub of parents abandoning a kid when the other is sick and then trying to get back into the kid's life when the sick one dies, the more I am certain a lot of people shouldn't have been allowed to have kids.", "I love Aunt and Uncle for the misrouted stork story.  I'm so glad you got the parents you actually deserve!  NTA", ">My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened\n\nYup.

My abusive father loved to say \"I'll always be your father\" as if that biological fact made any difference in our relationship after all of the years he spent treating me like shit.", "\u2728Traumatize your parents back!\u2728 I love this for you. Supreme NTA from me. You do not owe them anything and they deserve nothing from you. You were a child, you deserved to be safe and loved and protected just as much as your sibling (not that it\u2019s their fault obviously), and they totally failed you. They made their bed, and need to know that their neglect has lasting long term consequences. Also your gran is aces, love her.", "NTA\n\nTheir are not your parents.", "This!", "\u201cHuh, funny, you didn\u2019t seem to grieve losing the other person you gave your DNA to\u201d", "I think not replying speaks louder. OP should ignore the letter and return to his life.", "Definitely legally correct. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My dad did the same, they sent me abroad to vacation with my aunt and when I came back, he's gone from the home. No explanation. Nothing. Obviously not as bad as OP's situation because I got to go back to my home and still had my mom. Turns out he went to live with his mistress and had 3 or 4 more kids after that, zero contact with him and he never reached out to me. No happy birthdays, nothing. I bumped into him once randomly and WISH I had reacted as OP did. Such a classy reaction. I was unfortunately very angry (as I still am, although this happened when I was 10 and I'm now 40 yrs old) and it showed.", "The absentee parents could have made a childhood adoption much easier and cheaper. They must have opposed it, purely for self serving reasons - probably related to their standing in the parish, if my experience with dysfunctional Catholics families tells me anything.", "Yes. It feels horrible no matter which one of them it is, though. Not even reaching out before the other kids died was horrible of them.", "Pure gold", "It's like, if you abandon your pets for literally years at your sisters house, you can't suddenly jump out and claim ownership, that boat has sailed... Dad's brother was class, other option is \"Hmmm, I've seen pictures, you're my bio-donor's right? Nice to meet you, I'm with my family though.\"\n\n>and how they\u2019ll always be my parents and I can\u2019t change that.\n\n...but *they* decided not to be OP's parents when they were 6 because it was inconvenient? And they only came and saw OP once a year until **OP** gave up trying to force visits at 12 and OP never heard from them again until now. Plus, OP made them legally her *former* parents at 18.....  weird that they think they had a second child now.\n\nAt this point I'd think about burning bridges and putting them on the street by going after them for 12 years of child support using the letter as proof. I highly doubt they gave their family *any* money when they abandoned their second child and I bet the last 14years have been financially straining, but you owe what you owe.\n\nNTA", "This, this was the case with my mom as well. The fact that they didn't bother to reconnect for 9 years, yea, no.", "I liked that line too.", "I'm so sorry this has happened to both of you, you were both robbed of a sibling. She'd want you to live your best life without your biological parents, and I wish you all the happiness pal x", "My Condolences!", "NTA - That wording sounded like a threat to me. And thankfully, the adoption did change that. They weren't parents in practice for over a decade and now not in name either.", "Yeah, like what?  Didn't they have to sign the adoption or at least not contest it?  Or is that waived because he was 18?", "Respond with \u201ck\u201d", "The Ray Stevens is strong in this group\u2026.and I live an hour from Pascagoula", "No, look it up. It\u2019s self righteous.", "NTA\n\nLook, my brother suffered a horrible burn that damn near killed him when he was 15 and I was 13. He likely only survived and has a good quality of life because medicine had come a long way for burns by 2001. I spent 6 months living with my Aunt and Uncle in another state because the Shriner's hospital was a over 4 hour drive from our house and my dad was in the military so he could only take so much time off. So my mom lived with my brother full time at the hospital while my dad would drive down on the weekends while going to work in the week. It was too difficult to keep me in school back home and they thought, since my Aunt and Uncle offered, I'd have a better time living with them. And I did. I had my drama over it for a bit, but I grew up and realized that was the best case scenario.\n\nBut I would go visit my family in Texas, they would call when they could. I knew what was going on with my brother. And then I moved back after school ended in June and thankfully we all moved back home in August.\n\nAt no point did my parents abandon me because my brother was on death's door. They did need to give more to him, but we talked about it. And he's required special care since then. But my parents never abandoned me.\n\nThey absolutely could have kept you and loved you if they had wanted to. They could have had your Uncle look after you for a year or w/e, kept in touch, and let you know it was just temporary through the worst of it. But they decided your sibling was all they wanted to take care of and they abandoned you. And they've only tried to get in touch after your sibling has died.\n\nThey don't care about you.\n\nThey deserve far worse than what you said to them. Don't feel bad about pretending to not recognize them. They didn't raise you. They didn't love you.\n\nMake sure your grandma and others know you want nothing to do with them. Hold your ground. You owe them nothing. And if, in the future, you change your mind, that is your prerogative.\n\nI wish you the best!", "NTA\n\nThey abandoned you. It doesn't matter why. They abandoned you. They don't get to come back now that the person they abandoned for you is gone.", "NTA in the slightest. Taking control of your own life like you did at such a young age is so life changing.\nThey had nothing to do with your upbringing and have no right to call themselves your parents.\n\nSending you a letter saying how they're hurt and did what they thought was best is plain narcissism, playing the victim card.", "NTA - what a classy reaction all things considered! Also so telling that their letter to you was not a sincere groveling apology knowing they can never make up for what they did - instead justifying their behavior and saying you were cruel.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for your past. \nBut \u201care you my dad\u2019s brother\u201d cracked me up. Absolute savage, I like you.", " I don't mean to minimize OP's trauma, I remember being 6 years old, very clearly. Being abandoned in this manner would have left soul-deep scars. The fact that she had the love and care of her aunt and uncle doesn't mitigate her pain. I'm sorry if I gave the wrong impression.", "Right? I caught that to. It\u2019s all about their feelings of hurt when *they* abandon him. Unbelievable. Sounds like OP really did end up with the best parents.", "Well we can be sure whatever the sibling had, it wasn't something requiring an organ transplant, else they would have heard from the dna donors sooner.", "Look, that song's been on-and-off stuck in my head since the 90s, mostly because it's so accurate.", "Honestly, I like OP's current way, better.  \"Oh... you're Dad's brother... I think I sort of remember you!\" is a master class in making the wound DEEP and festering.\n\nHatred is connection, and is caring.  If OP hates them, then there is something to work with, something to work through.  But this?  OP doesn't need them, and it turns out that they are just irrelevant.", "You are not a \"console-ation prize\"", "\"What are we to do, our daughter is dead?\"\n\"I know! Remember we had another child?  Let's go get it!\"\n\nI really hate saying this, as I know first hand the pain of losing a child, but I can easily imagine that was their thought process.", "Honestly the fact they didn't reach out to give you a chance to say goodbye to your sister is the nail in the coffin for me.\n\nWith health issues like this it's fairly rare for a person to die fully unexpectedly - hospitals will try to keep a person alive long enough for loved ones to say goodbye and even a day or two is enough to fly in.\n\nI am not saying you should have gone to her or even would have wanted to.\n\nJust... you deserved the chance, and the fact that even when the end was in front of them they didn't once consider *your feelings*? Didn't think maybe you'd want one last chance to see your formally beloved sister?\n\nIt just says everything to me. \n\nI don't know how they felt when you were born, but for thr last 15 years they have not cared about your feelings or well being at all.", "And, though not technically correct, they pretty much threw away their parenthood when they dumped OP on the family with no explanation.", "Oof, is that the one where the Spare Parts Sister >!finally sticks up for herself and refuses to donate organs to Sick Sister ... and then Spare Parts promptly dies in an accident so the sister gets the organs anyway?!<  Or was it one of the other variants?"]}
