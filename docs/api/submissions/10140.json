{"id": 10140, "submission_id": "1141cmp", "title": "AITA for not giving my embryo to my ex husband and his wife?", "selftext": "So my ex husband and I got divorced six years ago. Before that we had gotten married pretty young and were trying for a baby. After a year of nothing we were convinced I was infertile. I then went to a fertility clinic and got tested and found out I was perfectly fine. It was confusing since male infertility wasn\u2019t even in our thoughts. He got tested and that\u2019s when we found out he has a zoospermia meaning he has no sperm. We were shocked and upset and it was hard on us. \n\nHe ended up getting a microTESE surgery where they take sperm directly from the penis and we ended up getting five sperms. The doctor said it was a miracle. Three were viable and made into embryos with my egg and we implanted two. One implanted and we had our son. Things were fine after that. We did end up separating and divorcing amicably. I had more kids with my husband. He got remarried recently.\n\n\nHis wife is really kind and nice and gets along with our son well. I didn\u2019t know if they had plans to adopt or have a donor or what to have a family together. I thought my ex was clear on that he couldn\u2019t have any more biological kids considering the test we had done was a one time thing typically. In December they invited me over for a dinner which I thought was nice. It was a catered five star meal, I was wondering why they were being so kind, thought maybe because of the holidays coming up. Turns out they were planning to ask me if I could \u201cadopt\u201d over the embryo we have to them as they desperately want to have a biological child together. \n\n\nI explained that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having another biological child with my ex husband considering I\u2019m remarried. Also I wouldn\u2019t feel ok with MY biological child being inserted into her and having her be pregnant and birth the baby. I don\u2019t feel a connection to an embryo but I do my living breathing newborn. I just can\u2019t imagine that dynamic. They said that it\u2019s not just mine but also my husbands and it\u2019s his only chance to have another biological child and he deserves to have the chance to experience a pregnant with his wife again. I told them I understand but that I was standing firm in my no. They both cried and I left. I told my husband and he agrees with me and says they should adopt or use a donor or even adopt another embryo someone has up for adoption. \n\n\nI thought the matter was settled but turns out it\u2019s not. They told mutual people we both know who are now in my business messaging and calling me wanting to tell me their two cents on what I should do. Most are telling me I would be a savior to help them have a baby and that it\u2019s not just mine and that if it was the opposite way with me being infertile and us having one shared embryo left that I would want to use it. It\u2019s making me feel guilty so many people are telling me I\u2019m being selfish or immature.

It's easy for people to have opinions when they don't have to deal with the fallout, emotionally and otherwise. If there isn't a problem with her eggs, then what they need is a sperm donor. There's no reason the child must be biologically related to him unless he's unable to love a child who isn't, which is problematic. Your husband raised the possibility of embryo adoption. Regular adoption is also an option. If they're uncomfortable with all the available options, that means their comfort is more important than yours, which is also problematic. They seem overly invested in the one thing that you're uncomfortable with. Personally, I find it a bit creepy that they went to such elaborate lengths to butter you up.

I could give me opinion on the matter if someone asked me...which to be clear, is the exact same opinion as yours.  But I would never try to bully you or guilt you like these people are\n\nThey are not your friends\n\nDistance yourself from them and do your best to distance yourself from your ex (to the best of your ability considering you share a child) for the time being.  I get why they asked.  I would have asked too.  But I would have respected your decision if you said no and would have made sure my wife respected it too.\n\nAnd as others have stated...contact a lawyer.

You are perfectly reasonable for whatever choice you want to make.", "Holy NTA. It was fine for him to ask, and absolutely proper for you to say 'NO.' I really hope and am curious if there are laws governing your rights in this case as well.\n\nThat they went sharing this information with others is a disgusting violation of your medical privacy. While something like HIPAA does not apply, I think it is wrong of them to feel this is your obligation and indecent to share this information without your consent.", "You might want to consult a family attorney. He may have paternal rights. \n\nI agree, NTA, but you might want to cover your bases.", "NTA - you are not under any obligation to provide them a baby. I remembered a court case, and see it in the comments where it was found that your consent was required to utilize the embryo.\n\nAlso, that was crappy of them to include others - that destroys any relationship or chance of compromise.", "NTA let him go through the process again to get his sperm and fertilise her eggs", "NTA its a bit inappropriate to ask as you as the legal owner according to comments, even more inappropriate to do what they have done since you said no.

So the ex husband and new wife don't try and take it.", "NTA may want to get those destroyed sooner than later. I\u2019m not really seeing their logic. The kid would be 50% biological so they met as well go with her egg and a donor.", "NAH. This is most definitely one of those decisions that both parties must be 100% on board with.  Stand your ground.", "NAH\n\nThe embyro is both of yours biologically so I understanding them asking and you saying no, especially since you got it in the divorce. \n\nThe flying monkeys trying to guilt you are AH.

Both people should say yes otherwise it's a no.", "This is absolutely massive. If your gut instinct was no, and it\u2019s still no, then you mustn\u2019t do it. We are all different, and we all deal with things in different ways. If donating the embryo isn\u2019t 100% right for you, then you cannot do it. It could have a huge impact on your mental health.\n\nIf they\u2019re never going to be used, can you get them destroyed? I\u2019ve never really thought about that scenario.\n\nNTA", "No nta definitely no now because no doesn't mean convince me and it definitely doesn't mean tell everyone you know so everyone hates you enough to change your mind.", "NTA. They can get a sperm donor adopt. No one needs biological children.", "NTA. The child wouldn\u2019t be biologically hers. He already has biological children. Seems to me they should just use a sperm donor.", "NTA\n\nTell those people (assuming they are women) that you are glad they are volunteering to donate their embryo and will pass the good news to your ex", "NAH.\n\nTough situation, but doesn't sound like there's a clear right or wrong. If at the end of the day, they had that baby and you still felt is was YOUR kid due to the egg, it would be really weird.\n\nINFO though: Can't they get a sperm donor and use one of her eggs? Why the hesitation with going down that route when its essentially the same thing he's asking his wife to do?", "NAH\n\nYou have conflicting wants, it doesn't make anyone TA. But you may also be about to have a legal battle on your hands. You and ex-husband may share ownership of those embryos unless you sorted that out in the divorce.", "NAH because it's also his DNA. He may be legally entitled to it so maybe check that out", "NAH. The embryo is half yours, and you have veto power over its use. You aren't TA for not wanting your own genes to be out in the world without your participation. But, also, I don't understand your objection. If I were in your spot (which I find hard to imagine, maybe because I'm male) I don't think I would object to a loving couple raising a child that was biologically mine.\n\nIf you decide to consent, talk to a lawyer to make sure you don't end up responsible for the child if you don't want to be. \n\nGood luck. This sounds like a tough spot for you, and I hope it works out okay.", "Seems I'm going against the crowd here, but I'm gonna say YTA. Lots of people are saying your embryo, your choice, but it's not your embryo. It's your egg with his sperm that formed an embryo. More importantly, you have hundreds of eggs, and he has just one sperm left that's already fertilized an egg.

It is awkward as well but since you can't remove sperm anymore and you can't split the embryo back up into its components, I can sort of understand the \"desparation of sperm\" \n\nWhat ticks me off is the \"he needs a genetic connection to the baby\", a baby is a baby, no matter the DNA. As the wife of your ex, I would deeply think about that but that isn't your issue though. \n\nIf I were in your position, I would also think about what happens to the \"unused\" embryos.

Why do you think it being his genetic material not give him a choice?", "Was thinking the same! He already has a bio child, his wife doesn't (at least we don't know) so who's the selfish one here, huh?", "I would assume there's a big financial and medical benefit to using the already existing embryo and implanting it for the new wife to carry.

The other alternative is him having no physical connection to the fetus at all.\n\nBTW I have very little sympathy for his position here, just explaining his probable thought process.", "this!", "OP has said in another comment that her ex and his wife feel that her carrying, birthing and feeding the baby will create a bond.\n\nI can understand where they're coming from, but that's quite a risk they're taking. Not everyone gets that rush of love when their baby is placed on their chest, especially if the birth has been traumatic or the pregnancy has been very difficult. And that's without throwing PND or even potentially PTSD (if there was a traumatic birth) into the mix. \n\nI really think ex and his wife need proper counselling before they go any further. They need to have all potential scenarios and repercussions spelled out to them and be encouraged to discuss all the potential outcomes with each other and a trained professional.\n\nAnd not just the outcomes of a traumatic but successful delivery, but what about if OP agrees, embryo is implanted, and the new wife miscarries? That's the last embryo. Will they turn on OP and declare that since she's had several healthy pregnancies she should have offered to surrogate for them? Will they try to restrict her access to the child she has with her ex, since she has other children and they can never have another?\n\nIt's an emotional minefield, which is why all the people contacting OP really need to back off and sit down.", "Doubtful the ex husband would agree, and it's his as well.", "Because wife gets the experience of pregnancy, childbirth, etc., which is gonna give the \u201cconnection\u201d even if it\u2019s not technically biological, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not gonna feel like hers after she\u2019s the one who carries and births it, so the lack of biological connection is probably fine with her.", "Luckily I have full custody since everything was always in my name from the start and he signed off on it. He\u2019s threatening to take me to court about it since I\u2019m being too \u201cimmature\u201d and a kidnapper.", "He can\u2019t. It was a one time deal", "Also it\u2019s probably best to destroy the embryo so no one can use it.", "I asked them this too. They\u2019re saying he would have no connection to the baby. By giving them the embryo she gets the have the experience of carrying and birthing the baby and bonding with it and he gets to be the biological father.", "you can\u2019t be serious. no one is entitled to her egg for any reason. they can adopt if they want children.", "It would be HER child. Could fight for it too, could even fight for custody once it's born.", "It\u2019s her embryo as much as his. Her DNA as much as his. The embryo being used  is a \u201dtwo yes, one no\u201d situation.", "You are free to donate your own embryo to the cause if you feel so strongly for them. That child would be biologically OPs, and she's not ok with it, because wants to be the mother of all her biological children and they are not for sale. At the same rate, the wife has no issues- she could use a sperm dono, so why don't they? Adoption also exists, so why don't they?  They did not exhaust their options and the answer was **NO**.", "For not being willing to allow someone to potentially raise her biological child without her input whatsoever?", "How is she heartless for not giving her embryos to her ex? They would legally be her children", "No. If the husband didn\u2019t want his sperm to be used for her future children then he also has that right.", "Maybe it\u2019s time to call the clinic and have it destroyed.  But if you don\u2019t call the clinic put passwords in all this information so she doesn\u2019t pretend to be you or they don\u2019t get someone to pretend to be you.", "People calling you selfish would likely do the same in your position. He was way out of line sending in the flying monkeys on you. Next time someone mentions it simply say, \"OMG! Your ... nose?\" And when in horror they say, \"WHAT! am I bleeding?\" Say, \"No, I found it in my business!\" People are way too cozy shoving their faces in other's private affairs.", "What about his wife\u2019s ability to have a biological child????\n\nThis emphasis on the man\u2019s biological connection over all else is very misogynistic. He\u2019s acting like you and his new wife are no more than incubators. It\u2019s gross.", "but it won't be HER biological child. Why are they not all concerned about that?", "But isn't he being selfish wanting a biological child that's only his and not his new wife's?\nI wouldn't be feeling guilty if I was you. They are putting the weight of this problem on you, and it's not fair. It's your egg, your DNA there. They have to find another solution that doesn't prejudice anybody.\n\nNTA", "You are not confortable with this idea, the end of it. They can use sperm from a donor if they want to live a pregnancy together. Being a father does not necessarily means being a father biologically.", "His lack of sperm is not your problem. If you don't intend to use the embryo it may be time to consider getting it destroyed so he can't do something shady.", "Okay. That makes sense. I was thinking they could just try and squeeze a couple more out of him. That aside, NTA. His lack of sperm is not your responsibility.", "Not the person you asked, but something like this is a case of \u201ctwo yeses, one no.\u201d I think if OP wanted to use the embryo, she would also be an AH if she did not have the ex\u2019s consent. (Ignoring legal ownership rights here, just whether or not someone is TA.)", "It doesn\u2019t trumps his, they are equal. But It has to be two yes\u2019s or it\u2019s a no to use the embryos", "It\u2019s a two yes, one no situation. No one\u2019s genetic material trumps the other, both have veto power and neither of them can use the embryos without the other\u2019s consent. If the situation were reversed, he would have just as much right to say no as she does now.", "Are you familiar with the concept of \"Two yes, one no\"? Same thing here. Neither trumps the other, but both have to consent in order for the embryo to be signed over/implanted. So if the positions were flipped - she wanted to use one of the embryos, but he didn't want her too - she would be an AH if she went ahead with the procedure without his consent.", "It\u2019s a two yes, one no type of situation. The embryo is made up from both of theirs. Therefore it needs both of their consent to implant it. It would be the same if she wanted to use it with her current husband and her ex refused.", "Two yeses, one no. If she wanted to implant them and he didn't want her to, she couldn't either.", "If it was reversed and she and her new husband wanted to use the embryo and her ex husband said no, that would be ok too. If they still had some of his sperm that hadn\u2019t been combined with her egg? Awesome! Knock yourself out. But no one gets to use someone else\u2019s genetic material without their permission.", "Idk it sounds to me like his wife is totally on board with the plan, so I don\u2019t think we should assume the ex is somehow putting his own wishes over his new wife\u2019s, unless I\u2019m missing something.", "Not necessarily. Using a spent donor does not automatically mean going through IVF.", "OP stated the embryo became her property in the divorce.", "Get a lawyer. I don\u2019t think he has a chance but protect yourself.", "For clarification, full custody of the egg? Because if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d be considering how to donate it to science at this point.", "You might want to get it destroyed before this goes any further. You aren't getting back with your ex husband. There is no need to preserve it.", "If it's legally your property, destroy it asap. Dealing with people's disapproval.is better than having the threat of someone having your baby against your will hanging over your head.\n\nNTA The wife is not entitled to your egg, no matter whose sperm is in it. Do not let them have it.", "Out of curiosity, when you two divorced, did y'all ever discuss what ought to happen to this remaining embryo? Why did you both decide not to have it destroyed when you decided the marriage was over? If you wanted more children but for some reason were unable to, would you consider using this embryo for your own child, and would your ex have any rights? This is just such a messy situation.", "Agree with everyone here, need to get with a lawyer ASAP just to be 100% sure.", "The best choice is to destroy the embryo BEFORE you receive an injunction. \n\nBefore the injunction it\u2019s legally yours and he has no control over your genetic material. You do not want to waste time and resources fighting this. Destroy it today.", "Amazing how people always claim someone is \u201cimmature\u201d for not doing exactly what they\u2019re told to do. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t kidnap an embryo that\u2019s in your name.", "Depending on where you are, embryos are considered property. I'm actually surprised the clinic didn't have you sign paperwork regarding this before any treatments were done - I know my clinic had my (now ex) and I decide what would happen to any remaining embryos if we should get divorced. Check your paperwork to make sure. They should be considered property of the marriage and their outcome (either destroyed, used for scientific research, or adopted) decided upon in your separation/divorce agreement.", "LPT (Life Pro Tip) any time, ANY and EVERY time some one threatens legal actions (lawyer, court, etc) you stop all communication.\n\nThem - \nI'm going to sue you\nI'm going to call my lawyer. Etc \n\nYou - \nThat certainly is your right to do so. At this point our conversation is over. Moving forward, you can communicate via (snail) mailed letters or through my attorney, whichever you prefer.", "He's an ah... he already has a bio child, but he's wife has to miss out because of his ego and they but you into the whole mess??? Nope\nNTA", "if he needs a genetic link to care/connect to the child then they should not be having children", "Barf. This is so misogynistic.", "So why is she entitled to his sperm?", "but OP does not seem to want the child.  Maybe it's legal for her to keep it, but it seems unnecessary.", "It's his only chance for biological children. At the time he used all 3(i think it was 3) of his sperm he was married. I think most people don't expect a divorce to happen. I believe that is a crucial piece of information in his decision vs having it frozen if that was an option. We don't know the circumstances of the divorce, but think about it. He has NO options. She loses nothing by giving it over. She has a chance to do something incredible for someone without any other hope. Indeed she is an asshole.", "Can\u2019t do that without his permission. But she can get a legal injunction to prevent the clinic from giving him the embryos", "He likely has legal rights over the embryo as well. Getting it destroyed without his permission would be an AH move, as well as potentially illegal.", "Right? I'd feel about as comfortable calling someone up and telling them what to do in a personal situation as I would trying to pilot a jumbo jet. Who ARE these people???", "I was wondering the same thing.  Husband already has one biological child and the priority in his new marriage is for him to have a second biological child, especially when a sperm doner situation would be less awkward considering the circumstances.   The size of this man's ego...", "They\u2019re saying the experience of being pregnant, breastfeeding and caring for the baby creates a bond that my ex husband wouldn\u2019t have if they used a donor. It gives her a way to connect with the baby without being the bio parent and a donor can\u2019t give them that bond.", "Yeah I caught that further along, thanks.", "Because they did this together. This is a two-yes situation. She said no. If she wants the embryo for some other reason he's free to say no as well.", "She\u2019s not. That sperm was from when they are married. At no point did op say she was planning to use the embryo. Just that she was unwilling to surrender the embryo for the wife to adopt", "she\u2019s not? she\u2019s not the one wanting to create a child with it. it goes both ways.", "He already has a biological child since one of the times worked.", "Oh yes, how heartless and cruel of her not to want her ex-husband to be raising what would be also HER biological child! The calamity!! What would be heartless and cruel would be the mental anguish if she had to watch another woman raise her child over the next two decades. He has a biological child and frankly it is so gross that he tried to butter her up with a good meal and now he's throwing a tantrum to anyone who will listen because he didn't get what he wanted, that makes him the biggest AH in this situation. He signed away his rights to that embryo, full stop.  This is her boundary in her marriage with her current partner but we're all glad to know you would absolutely do this for your ex-spouse. Gold star for you!", "If she is the owner of the embryo I don\u2019t think it be a asshole move. I think she be well with in her rights. But I do agree she needs to find out forayed she can legally do it.  But if it can legally be destroyed I would do that immediately. But in the mean time I would password protect everything at the clinic to make sure they don\u2019t lie to gain access.\n\n\nBut in most states when ivf is used even if the couple is married a contract is written out in case of separation and divorce who get custody over the embryo. In most cases it\u2019s the egg donor in this case op. So op\u2019s ex has no say in her destroying it. And she doesn\u2019t need to tell him or get permission.", "People who need to get a hobby I say! LOL", "And yet this happens all the time. I think that if your husband is so terrible that he wouldn't bond with a baby using donor sperm then he shouldn't have more children.", "Great, so you believe that if a man fertilizes an infertile woman's last egg and later tells her she isn't allowed use it, he's not an asshole.", "Yeah, I made this reply before I saw she said in another comment that she's the legal owner. That said, I still think it's a little bit of a AH move to have the embryo destroyed even if she has the legal right to do so...biologically it belongs to both of them. Idk. It seems to me like the embryo should've been destroyed when they divorced, unless OP planned on using it herself (and if she used it without her ex's permission, would also be an AH move). They're just kind of at an impossible impasse right now so idk why they kept the embryo around anyway I guess.", "yep. he wouldn\u2019t be an asshole.", "...yes? How would that differ, assuming the same circumstances?", "I was thinking the same thing. The only reason I say destroy asap is because unfortunately you can\u2019t trust that her ex and current wife won\u2019t find away to use it with out permission. Plus right now there is no courts involved it\u2019s hers. If she destroys it now then nothing they can do. When a judge gets involved who\u2019s to say what he would rule. Not counting a very ugly court battle they will be putting their son threw. \n\n\nBut I agree whole heartedly it should have been felt with at the time of divorce."]}
