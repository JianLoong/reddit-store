A sentence like \"It's been a long time since I saw you, you've grown up.\" can be quite innocent or extremely creepy depending  on the tone. You can retell the story and it might sound like nothing to a listener, but the response at the moment suggests either something was off with your tone or she has some other trauma that warped her sense of normalcy. \nI think a correct response would be to apologize for your response, tell your brother you were initially offended as you truly did not think your actions can be taken that way. You are proud of your niece for removing herself from a situation that made her uncomfortable, will fully respect her bodily autonomy and boundaries from now on.", "ESH\n\nYour brother should not have accused you of being a pervert. He should have simply expressed that your niece didn't like the interaction and asked you to apologise and do better.\n\nYou shouldn't have doubled down when you were told that the interaction wasn't welcome. It doesn't matter that you meant well. As soon as you found out that it wasn't received well, you should have apologised.", "I get the sense that you're a bit of an unreliable narrator. The fact you treated your niece differently from the boys is one thing, and the fact you hadn't seen her in years in another. If your family confronted you saying you made their young daughter uncomfortable, the thing to do would be apologize and not do it again. Not double down and get defensive. YTA", "Question: Why did you think that touching her cheek would be appropriate? You hugged the nephews, why not a quick hug for the niece? what made you think that touching her skin AND ruffling her hair would be appropriate?", "Hmmm.\n\nI don't think you're the asshole. It depends on how you touched her cheek...\n\nDid you give it a gentle pinch, or did you cup her face in your hand for a second too long???? The latter? Yeah, creepy. You haven't seen her in years. She doesn't know you. Highly inappropriate. A pinch on the cheek? Well.... I remember what it was like being a 14 year old girl. If my uncle, who I hadn't seen in years, rubbed my makeup off my cheek and ruined my hair, I'd have been pissed too. Teenage hormones are wild. But to be honest, I don't think I'd like it much as an adult either. \n\nIn any case, you're in the wrong. I don't want to go so far as to say you're an asshole, but you shouldn't touch teenage girls' faces. Even if they're family. Even if your intentions were innocent.\n\nBut your brother is in the wrong here too. There was no reason for him to call you names and turn it into a big thing. He could have just said something like \"hey man, I know you mean well, but you can't do that. You just can't touch girls faces like that. She feels uncomfortable and I think you should apologise and try to clear the air. Let's go together...\"", "INFO: which cheek", "NTA you hugged the  brothers and you patted her cheek. That is a respectable thing to do, and ruffling up the hair such an uncle thing to do. If she felt uncomfortable being touched at all she could at 14 tell you. Heck even your brother could say his daughter hates being touched unless she gives permission. Edit: I understand protecting your child but to jump to this with your own brother. Unless OP is missing something in the story that he didn't mention. Edit 2: If that is the full truth I would decide in the future with your brother touch no one. Do not speak to the daughter unless she speaks to you. Protect yourself from accusations because accusations like this will hurt you even if you're innocent.", "ESH Your brother called it perverted is over the top, but your behavior was inappropriately patronizing.

I don't think you're a pervert but wtf are you doing touching someone else's face. Boundaries my dude. I don't give a duck if your related to someone. You don't go around touching people's faces. Just because someone is a minor doesn't mean they don't get to have bodily autonomy. Do you touch other people's face without their consent. Seriously wtf is with people thinking it's OK to ignore the wants desires and boundaries of young people. \n\n I'm an uncle. My niece and nephew are 4 and 6. My nephew who is 6 doesn't really like to be handled much. My niece does. Despite being autistic I'm entirely capable of reading her body language and seeing when she wants to be dangled upside down and when she wants me to leave her well alone. \n\n Like seriously forget it's your niece. You don't own her. Don't touch people unless they are OK with it.\n\n Edit: Also wtf this thread. Respect peoples autonomy.", "I mean, touching in general can be uncomfortable for a lot of people, specially the face. So you shouldn't have done that.\n\nBut family members with poor boundaries tend to do it anyway, which justifies your initial interaction. As a young receiver of such harmless interactions, culture says suck it up as long as it doesn't become a habit or it escalates. \n\nJumping straight to \"pervert\" from their end seems blown of out proportions, unless there's history, vibe or the touching was a second too long.\n\nAs written, NTA, but not without any fault.", "ESH.\n\nYour brother jumped to several conclusions. \n\nYou doubled down instead of apologizing when you\u2019re told your touch is unwanted. As a general rule, teenage girls don\u2019t want to be touched by adult men, even if they\u2019re related, even if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d their face.

But, if it made someone uncomfortable, apologise and such.", "ESH\nYou really didn't need to touch anyone's face when greeting them. Long time or not. And ruffling the hair is in a private at worst, annoying at best. \n\nYour brother was an AH too cause he was a bit forward with his accusations. But again, you didn't need to touch her face at all if you hugged her brothers. Just hug her.", "When the hell has anyone ever \"patted\" someone's cheek as a greeting??  That isn't even a thing.\n\nWow.\n\nYTA", "I mean it\u2019s hard to tell just from what you wrote here. In your mind you could have touched her cheek with a little tweak or whatever but clearly everyone else there didn\u2019t interpret it that way. I find it likely there was a look in your eyes that said you liked the way she looked (even if you didn\u2019t intend it that way) and that THAT coupled with  the cheek touch is what led to people labeling it as creepy.", "It's kind of weird that you hugged the brothers but touched the one girl's face. Why the difference in treatment? Accusing you of being a pervert is going too far, but touching someone on the face *does* feel more intimate to me than a simple hug, and I definitely would've been uncomfortable at her age if a family member who I barely know did that. (Honestly even now my partner is really the only one who can touch my face without me feeling a little smothered and uneasy.) \n\nAgain, without more information I don't think that this makes you a creep or pervert or whatever, but doubling down and justifying your behavior after being told it made your niece uncomfortable does make YTA.", "I understand where many people come from saying you are not the asshole, because for one your intentions were innocent, and secondly boundaries are by nature a highly subjective concept, so there are things, that are ok for some, but for others.\n\nBut I'll give you a YTA, because a boundary was clearly communicated and instead of doing the mature thing of acknowledging it and moving on, you kept on justifying crossing it to the point of everyone getting involved.\n\nIt's actually wild what adolescent girls see, read, hear and experience in relation to them, their body or girls their age and if you've never walked in the shoes of a young girl growing up it's hard to understand. So if she says \"Hey, I didn't like that\" literally just apologise, tell her you won't do it again, and move on. \n\nYou are not a bad person for wanting to express affection, but your good intentions simply don't justify your nieces discomfort. YTA for not being considerate and not respecting your nieces boundaries.", "Who knows if things really went the way you claim went. Which crazy brother accuses own brother of being a perv because of one single \"innocent\" interaction.

However, I remember being a 14 year old girl who had just developed a more womanly figure and the comments about 'how I have grown' with a bit of a look up and down my body. Sometimes it was creepy. There was an implied sexual element. I am sure you didn't mean it that way but it happens enough to maybe have made her sensitive to it. And she may have mentioned such incidents to her dad. So, maybe just giving them a bit of understanding of why they misinterpreted you in that instance.", "NTA, however she is 14 and if she was uncomfortable with what you did, she may have been too intimidated to say anything about it.
