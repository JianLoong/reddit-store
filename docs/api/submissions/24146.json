They\u2019ve been played with by me and my 3 cousins over the years, so they were in quite rough shape. At the time, they were all in my grandparent\u2019s toy box at their house. However, about 6 months ago, they called my mom and my aunt to let them know they were getting rid of all their old toys, and if they wanted any, they should come and collect them. \n\nThey were separated by who the toys belonged to, my mom or my aunt. Neither my mom or my aunt wanted any of the toys, so me and the cousins were called down to take from our mother\u2019s stashes. (I am 25f, my cousins are 30f, 19f, 15f, and 12m). We took from our own parent\u2019s stash first, then were allowed to take from the other stash if there was anything left over. \n\nMy 30 year old and 12 year old cousin didn\u2019t want anything from their mom\u2019s stash. 19 and 15 took a couple of little things, but I\u2019m really the only one who took a significant amount. 4 of the Barbie\u2019s + the play sets were my moms, so those were unquestionably mine no matter what. However, my aunt\u2019s one Barbie was not wanted by any of the cousins (she had a broken neck/ratty hair/looked awful), so I took her in the final round after everyone else grabbed what they wanted. \n\nI collect vintage Barbies, so it was a dream to get these all and fix them up. I gave the broken ones new bodies, fixed their hair, bought their missing outfit pieces online, all of it. I posted pics to Facebook about a month after I got them all and my aunt and cousins loved the restorations I did. They told me I brought justice to the dolls who served our family so well. \n\nTwo weekends ago, our whole family went out to see the Barbie movie. Afterwards, my 19f cousin asked if she could have her mom\u2019s Barbie. I was sad, and knew I could technically say no, but I agreed because I really didn\u2019t mind that much. I told her I\u2019d drop it off in a few days. Before I did, I removed all the extra clothings/shoes/accessories I bought and gave her back the doll (which was still on a new body with fixed hair, but was only wearing her original shirt she came in). My cousin and my aunt were pissed. They said this wasn\u2019t the same doll, they pointed to the picture I posed on Facebook and asked what happened to her shoes/earrings/outfit/etc. I told them I bought that stuff separately, originally she only had the one shirt. I gave it back to them exactly as she came (though she was clean and fixed).\n\nMy cousin just gave me the doll back, saying she didn\u2019t want a half naked doll. My aunt is saying that I stole those clothing pieces, she knows her doll originally had all that stuff (which yeah, it did, but she lost it all over the years and I had to rebuy it separately). I didn\u2019t mind giving up the doll originally, but now I kind of don\u2019t want to give it up.

If they wanted the barbie, they should have accepted it when it was originally offered to them. NTA.", "NTA, but they certainly are the AH for demanding you give them the restored doll. It was very nice of you to say yes, and you were not at all obligated to include all the extras you purchased.", "NTA \n\nYou paid for it all, it's not theft to keep what you paid for. It's your property. Period.", "NTA.  \n\nYour cousin had first dibs on the doll.  It\u2019s sounds like it went through a number of rounds that your cousin could have grabbed it in. She chose not to.  That\u2019s her fault.  You said you waited until the end and when no one took it you did.  Again, plenty of opportunities for your cousin that we\u2019re squandered.  \n\nYou spent money and time, which has a value, to restore the doll back to its original version. You made the time and monetary investment. Only after you did that did they see the value they passed up.  \n\nThey are the assh*les for asking for it back. They should be happy that you were kind enough to return it.  The expectation that you would include all of the accessories is over the top as those accessories will fit your other dolls.  \n\nYou mention that your cousin gave you the doll back.  Two options here.  Take it back for your collection and make very clear they won\u2019t get it back if they ask again. The second option is to tell them keep it, as is  without the accessories, and do as they wish with it to avoid any further family drama and the clothing to your current dolls wardrobe.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  You were still going to get use out of the things you bought so you kept them.  They didn't want it until you did the work and spent the money to make it nice and only then did they want it.  My guess is they were going to sell it online and got pissed that you didn't just provide them with everything they needed too do it.  Efffff that.  Tell them to screw off.", "NTA. You went by the rules. Your interest and investment in them aside, you shouldn't have been asked to give up anything based on that alone.", "They didn\u2019t want it when it was trash, but only wanted it after you took the time to fix it up. You were kind to agree. NTA, but your aunt & cousin sure are.", "This is going to be unpopular but- ESH for ineffective communication all around. \n\nThe way to solve this would have been to say to your cousin, \u201cThe doll is yours, no problem. But I put significant time and money into finding her original outfit. I would like to keep that, unless you can possibly cover those costs.\u201d And then you could have had a conversation and negotiated.", "NTA. She had no interest until you restored it", "NTA - It was kind of you to give the doll back at all. Get the receipts for the clothes you bought and send them to your aunt. They are being so tacky.", "C\u2019mon now.  You know this was passive-aggressive and petty because you didn\u2019t want to give the doll back at all.  I get that, you\u2019d put care and money into restoring the doll, but your cousin obviously wanted it because it had new sentimental value to her after seeing the movie.  It was her mom\u2019s doll.  \n\nThough, I suppose that with a new body, it wasn\u2019t really her mom\u2019s doll, it was her mom\u2019s doll\u2019s head.  \n\nRegardless, your cousin wanted something of emotional significance that she regretted giving up.  You got the doll itself for free, and you could have just explained the money spent.  YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone accusing me of stealing over something like this is ending that relationship.", "NTA. You're passionate about these dolls; the cousin just wants the doll because she's jumping on a movie trend. It's understandable that she didn't want it when it was broken, but she never asked if you would be able to help her restore the doll or had any sentimentality about it when she first saw it in better condition. She just wants it because Barbie is cool in her mind now.\n\nThe value of the time you've put into restoring the doll is probably far more than the value of those clothes. You were willing to hand the doll over reluctantly giving them all of that effort for free. Nothing stopping the cousin from buying the same clothes and accessories for herself if she wants them. If she doesn't want to put even that much time into it, keep *your* doll and enjoy her. Your aunt has some nerve to accuse you of stealing *doll clothes*, like did she even think about that before it passed her lips.", "Both your cousin and your aunt are delusional if they think they were entitled to your work and money in restoring her old Barbie. I'm glad they gave you the doll back since it was yours. NTA", "wow wow wow NTA", "She wanted something she saw had value after being fixed. If it was about having emotional value, she would have accepted it before all the repairs and money spent."]}
