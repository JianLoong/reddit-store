The ceremony was beautiful and I enjoyed myself as much as someone who is famously not a wedding guy could. The dramatics were not quite as enjoyable.\n\nI (27m) hadn't seen my family in a few months, and we've only had a handful of phone calls over the course of those months. It's never on purpose that I pull one of these disappearing acts, it's mostly out of habit. I've been fiercely independent for most of my life and I get easily caught up in whatever I'm doing at the time that makes it hard for me to remember to keep those not in my direct line of sight in the loop. My mother is the same way. (It's also nice visiting around times when big events like this are going on as my mom is prone to hovering whenever I'm home, and this takes some of the spotlight off me.)\n\nI had been in Ireland around 8 months prior to flying in last Thursday. I was originally there to spend two weeks with my best friend who, thanks to the aforementioned one track mindness I possess, I had unfortunately grown apart from within recent years. Ours was a friendship that had started since we were 14 and was one of the most important relationships in my life for over a decade, and I wanted to put more effort into it so I didn't lose it. He was spending time overseas as to reconnect with his heritage since his father's passing, I was already traveling, and my stay obviously turned out to be a lot longer than two weeks.\n\nIt also turned into us getting married. Funny how life works out.\n\nAbout two weeks before our trip the states for my sister's wedding, I sent out a mass email to close family letting them know that me and my husband were married. I wanted to assuage any possibility of us 'stealing any thunder' right from the get go. My mom replied that she was hurt that she wasn't told sooner or allowed to be there, which I understood.\n\nIt seemed her mood flipped by the time we met in person, however. Rehearsal dinner was on Friday, and that was where we all met up for the first time. My mom was overjoyed to see me and my partner and spent a large part of the night telling stories about she had always predicted there was something different about my friendship with him compared to others I was close with in high school. It was a very sweet moment. But at the end of the night, my sister pulled me aside and asked if we would not wear our wedding rings to her ceremony.\n\nI was confused, so I asked why. She said I was taking the attention off her and she was already bitter than I was 'hijacked' her rehearsal dinner. More family might take notice if I wore my ring tomorrow and cause a similar incident. I refused. Like I mentioned before, the ceremony was beautiful but she didn't speak to me for the rest of the weekend and we ended up leaving the reception early.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685566229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wxn28/aita_for_wearing_my_wedding_ring_to_my_sisters/", "score": 7708, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She must've been pretty hurt that her rehearsal dinner was all about you getting married. You should've thought that sending an email wouldn't stop any conversation about your surprise wedding right before your sister's... I understand you're a carefree guy, but maybe you could've found a better way/time to let everyone know about your neo-marriage.\n\nEdit: After reading your comments, YTA. Married for 4 months and let's a few know just before the wedding of his sister and still doesn't see any problem with his actions.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re TA, but I don\u2019t understand a lot of this. You seem more like you don\u2019t understand the consequences of your actions than a purposeful asshole. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand why you thought sending everyone an email that you had gotten married two weeks before getting there would have put an end to the \u201cstealing the thunder\u201d concerns. If anything, my mind immediately goes to the opposite. You may have \u201cinformed\u201d everyone beforehand but this is their first chance to ask you all the questions about it. And as it was unexpected and also seemingly fast, people are going to want details and often not care that there\u2019s another event/wedding going on. You even say that your mum spent a large part of the rehearsal dinner talking about your relationship and your marriage because she was so surprised and excited to be presented with this information. Are you confused about why your sister is upset? \n\nI don\u2019t think you needed to remove your rings necessarily because the damage was already done by the time of the wedding, if there was any. But I\u2019m a little bit confused by your actions here and can completely understand why your sister was upset even if she asked for the wrong thing.", "YTA. You were married for three months and you chose to announce your marriage just two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding. Then her rehearsal dinner became you and your spouse\u2019s debut not only as a couple but a married couple. I don\u2019t think people\u2019s lives should be on hold but I do think that when it comes to milestones events like a wedding, the guests of honor should have the entire spotlight to themselves and people shouldn\u2019t take away from that. You had to know that handling things this way was going to take attention away from your sister\u2019s big day.", "YTA, you stole her rehearsal dinner and you waited until two weeks before her wedding to announce hers.", "YTA - Normally asking someone not to wear their wedding ring would be a batshit crazy request but I actually get where your sister is coming from.\n\nYou seem remarkably self-centred and thoughtless of the impact of your actions and behaviour on others. How can you not think that running off to Ireland, getting married to someone you haven\u2019t seen for 14 years and then telling everyone 2 weeks beforehand (despite being married for 4 months!) wouldn\u2019t steal her thunder? Of course they are all going to be more interested in you because what you did was insane and so people will be wanting to talk about that. I think you know it would and that\u2019s why you waited. \n\nThe ring request wasn\u2019t really the big problem but your overall behaviour is.", "Hmm you\u2019re kind of TA. If you\u2019ve been married for 4 months you\u2019ve had a while to tell them and have chosen not to. 2 weeks before you do and then at rehearsal dinner that\u2019s what you\u2019re mother wants to talk about and then at the wedding if people haven\u2019t seen you for a while and given it\u2019s quite sudden people are going to ask questions. You have taken some of the attention away from her day which I don\u2019t think is fair. You could have just gone with your husband and told everyone you were married at a later date. Given you\u2019d waited months to tell them anyway what difference would a few more weeks have made.", "There\u2019s a lot of purely thoughtless people on Reddit lately, and you seem like one of them. You\u2019d been married MONTHS and told your family two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding in the most impersonal way (mass email). Then you go to the wedding, which would be everyone\u2019s FIRST CHANCE to ask you questions about your wedding in person. Of course they\u2019re going to focus on you. You really can\u2019t be bothered to think of others, can you? YTA.", "YTA  - You debuted your marriage at your sister's wedding.", "YTA normally I would say asking to remove wedding rings would be a big no, but I really get what your sister is upset about. You've been married for 4 months, yet wait until 2 weeks before your sister's wedding to email a few select people? Then hijack her rehearsal dinner - it sounds like you were out to ruin the wedding you didn't have. You could have worn the wedding ring on a chain for the night to keep it with you. I don't blame your sister one bit.", "YTA for deciding that your \"one track mind\" is just how you are and that you're not responsible for communicating with your family or planning things that include them. Emailing them to tell them you were married is so exclusionary and impersonal. I get that not everyone wants a big wedding, but you could've had a small party or at least made a phone call to your parents. From what you say, it's not that they were abusive. You were just lazy.\n\nThat said, I don't think you need to not wear your wedding ring to your sister's wedding. Your family's first time meeting your husband is going to naturally have a bit of focus on him regardless of your jewelry or lack thereof. Should've thought about this weeks ago and had a party to intro him then, but it's too late now.", "YTA\n\nYou had 8 months to inform your family you got married, you could have informed your family once you received the wedding invitation, instead you waited 2 weeks before your sister's wedding. And that's what makes you the AH", "YTA, you waited until two weeks before your sister's wedding to tell your family you secretly married your childhood friend in an international trip whirlwind romance four months ago? The least you can do is redirect anyone who starts making her wedding about your new marriage.

Whether you intended to steal the show or not, it doesn't seem like there was any specific reason to cut contact, so, yeah, you should have said something at least shortly after it happened. Would have avoided this whole scenario where it does at least look like you were spotlight stealing.", "YTA", "YTA slightly. maybe should have let the family know sooner that you were married instead of right before your sisters day possibly upstaging her. You had months to tell them. At least you didn\u2019t announce it at the wedding. In that said. Your sister can\u2019t assume everyone holds off their life because she is getting married. It\u2019s not fair for her to ask you to remove your rings. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are married. It\u2019s also not your fault for your mom or others asking about your new marriage. I feel better communication would have prevented your sister from being TA.", "YTA.", "Pretty simple request that wouldn't have hurt you at all. YTA.\n\nId have uninvited you.", "NTA wear your ring with pride. It's not the same as making a huge announcement when you should toast the new couple.", "NTA.  It strikes me as ridiculous to ask others to not wear wedding rings at your wedding reception.", "NAH, it seems like the \"thunder stealing\" would have happened regardless because you don't stop being married without it on but I do get why your sister didn't want you to wear the ring.", "NTA - gasp! God forbid family and friends take a moment to discuss your life in casual conversation at your sister\u2019s wedding. It might be the bride\u2019s \u201cday\u201d but the ones that insist on every single thought be about them have their heads planted firmly up their ass.", "NTA.

It's expected and normal. \n\nThe real instigator here agitate to be your mother, telling all the stories about how she \"just knew\" etc.", "NTA it\u2019s unreasonable to ask some one to remove their wedding ring. But you\u2019re still an asshole in the way you treat your family in general and then say oh it\u2019s just how I am. That\u2019s just code for I don\u2019t care about you, only myself.", "NTA... taking the ring off doesn't mean you aren't married anymore... who wants to tell her that??", "NTA. \n\nYour marriage is just as important as hers. You don't have any plans to make a scene at the wedding, and if someone decides to freak out because they notice you're wearing a ring, thats not your problem. It's unfair, and incredibly disrespectful, for her to ask you to hide your rings because she's jealous.\n\nThat said... In defense of your sister, it sounds like your mom did kind of make a lot of the rehearsal dinner about you, and I can understand your sister feeling like the attention was taken from her that night. Don't get me wrong, I think it's dumb to be upset about, but I get it. But that's something that should be a conversation with your sister and your mom (and I guess maybe you but honestly not really necessary?), so she can voice her feelings and ask her to keep the wedding day about the bride. \n\nI will say that sending an email 2 weeks before the wedding was not the best way to do things. How long had it been since you got married? If it had just happened, then yeah, timing sucks but whatever. If you got married and then sat on it until 2 weeks before the wedding, that's kind of shitty.\n\nYou did nothing *really* wrong and should not hide your wedding rings. I empathize with your sister but her request is totally out of line. You mom didn't do anything bad but should make an effort to focus on your sister for now.", "Is your sister lowkey a bigot?\n\nYou didn\u2019t hijack anything.

Taking off your rings during another wedding is not a reasonable request at all.\n\nNTA", "Wouldn't call you an asshole, neither her a bigot. My guess is her reaction would've been the same if you had married a woman.\nNot justifying her actions, just trying to shed some light. One of my best friends got married 6 years ago to this delightful girl. At least she was delightful until the wedding planning started, the change was unbelievable, holy crap. He almost called the wedding off if she didn't chill. Then the wedding happened, and they've been extremely happy ever since.\n\nI guess my point is, maybe your sister is just one of those legendary bridezillas we think only exist in movies and messed up reddit posts.\n\nAnyways, congrats on marrying your best friend dude!\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add the NTA, duh.", "NTA- you have put an effort into not stealing the thunder by sending out the email. Not wearing your rings is not going to unsend the email. If people mention your nuptials,  its not your fault, but you can kindly redirect them to the bride.", "NTA-You didn\u2019t hijack anything. The wedding was still her day and all about her marriage. Her request was unreasonable.", "NTA. I don't even get this mindset. So what if you just got married? People can talk about more than one event at a function. One doesn't cancel out the other.\n\nPersonally, I'd have thought it would lead to more joy, not less; a double toast at the reception for ex.", "NTA\n\nNo matter what you did (tell in advance, not tell), there were bound to be questions, especially with you being gone for months, even if that is normal for you. Your sister had no right to ask you to not wear your rings. It\u2019s not like you were asking to get married on her wedding day. My family isn\u2019t the greatest, but I can\u2019t imagine telling anyone not to experience their own joy. It should add to, not take away from mine.", "NTA\n\nI think YOU and YOUR spouse being there, together, as a couple, would have drawn attention whether you wore your wedding rings or not. \n\nIs you sister homophobic by any chance?", "NTA because it is ridiculous to ask a married person to not wear their wedding ring. That said, I probably would have taken the ring off because it was a simple way to make your sister happy. Plus if you really wanted to avoid stealing her thunder you would have left the rings off AND waited until well after the wedding to let people know. You obviously weren\u2019t in a rush to tell people, so what\u2019s a few more weeks? In sum, you were a jerk, but her demand was worse.", "This main character syndrome is annoying.     Yeah op could have told people sooner but getting married isn\u2019t a broadway show with the leading roles to be adulated by the audience.   People are coming g to witness a beautiful ceremony and share in your joy!   So what for a minute or two people might be distracted but the focus will revert back.  The bride needs to get over herself.  Op communicate better - maybe this wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.  Your sister maybe emotional and over reacting but you can take some accountability.

I suspect your sister isn't marrying for Love; so she doesn't have the the capacity to understand what she just asked you to do.\n\nI'm also suspicious that your fierce independence is in part an adaptation to having a dramatic needy sibling who is obsessed with being better than other people.\n\nBut that's all in the past... f her.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MARRIAGE!

We hadn't seen each other for about 3 months at the time I came to Ireland to visit him. \n\nNot arguing judgement, just wanted to specify a few things. I definitely wouldn't get married to someone I hadn't seen in over a decade or run off to Ireland without telling anyone. My family knew I was going to visit and I travel a lot as it is.

I had emailed close family but not every single guest in attendance, so seeing the rings would be some people's first introduction to the situation. Still, I don't think it was a totally reasonable request but wanted some outside feedback.", "I think sending the email did the opposite of mitigating the \u201cthunder stealing\u201d and that\u2019s the issue. Sending it two weeks out especially under the circumstances of the relationship and the wedding would engender more questions than less.

The more I think about it and the more insensitive you seem to be. I would've been more than pissed was I your sister. And I don't think it's about bigotry at all, It's about not taking into consideration other people, you should think a bit more about others.", "Yeah... I appreciate that OP tried, but two weeks was not nearly enough time to lessen the \"big news\" impact of this. Also I think OP should have done more to redirect attention at the rehearsal dinner. \"Thanks mom, it is exciting news but this is Sis's night. Husband and I will come over later/ after/ whenever and we can talk all about it.\" \n\nThat said, Sis requesting he not wear his ring is stupid and pointless. People are just as -- if not more -- likely to hear about the marriage from mom or literally anybody else at the rehearsal dinner as they are to ask because they happened to spot a ring. \n\nSo I don't think that OP was wrong to wear it, but I do think he made mistakes in other ways... ESH maybe?", "Even if OP didn\u2019t do it deliberately, it takes very little effort to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize this is the effect my email will have.

I think OP fucked up even if he didn\u2019t intend to and his sister might even be upset that he withheld that he got married from her as much as that her rehearsal dinner turned into mums soapbox to talk about her son and his new husband. \n\nI agree though, OP could have redirected mum at the rehearsal dinner.

Lifelong commitments are not something to be taken lightly. I think I perceive it differently than most.\n\nBut I do understand why she was hurt. I know weddings are a huge thing for some people even if they aren't for me.

I'll make sure to clear that up.", "Making this into \u201cshe cares a lot about weddings so I get why she was upset\u201d negates a lot of the impact your actions had here. Maybe the nonchalance you have and making it about her response to the situation is part of what is upsetting to her. It seems really self-centered and lacking in social skills to not understand that this was a possible impact. \n\nAnd as an aside, do you not think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s a little upset that you don\u2019t care enough about her to tell her you got married until 4 months after the fact? Just because everyone else was happy about it doesn\u2019t mean she was.", "But you should've thought about it before. More thoroughly than sending an email to your closest family 2 weeks before you've got to meet for your sister wedding.

You would've let everyone know way before than last minute or tried to keep it a secret even tho you were uncomfortable not wearing your ring so that her wedding day would've been for her wedding only.

Though if you got married in secret due to famalial pressures and etc (disaproving extended relations and all that) its way more understandable.

And you taking the spot light on a weekend she has been looking forward and (I am assuming) paid a small fortune to have, its understandable to be salty.

Guests talk about more than the bride--catching up with old friends or family, discussing new or growing babies, discussing new partners, food, clothing, jobs, and occasionally politics. I'm just guessing here, but if you don't wear your rings, people will gossip when you dance together--boyfriend? Casual date? Live together? Etc. A ring tells of your commitment to eachother, and the tone of conversations changes dramatically. Congratulations on your wedding! I wish you both much happiness.", "NTA, at least you gave them a bit of prior notice. The wedding sounded like it was nice anyway and it\u2019s understandable that sometimes these things slip your mind, although you probably should have told the fam a bit sooner.", "NTA. The rings are not a distraction to anyone.", "NTA\n\nNot for wearing your ring. My family is of the opinion once you put the ring on you don't take it off unless in extreme circumstances.  Om not that hard core but my mom didn't take hers off NOT ONCE for 20 years until the band had worn against her engagement ring to the point it needed to be fixed. My dad had is on for a similar time frame until they had to cut it off because his fingers were swollen for a medical reason (of course it was repaired and sized) \n\nSo for wearing your wedding ring it's not fair for anyone to ask you to take it off. That's sacred.  \n\nDid you know your sister was getting ready to announce her wedding or was it a total surprise? You should have made it known you were married the minute you knew about her plans. Also you should have sent the email AND called whom ever you think needed a person to person conversation about it. \n\nThe fact that OP did their own thing and didn't tell their family isn't for us to judge. Everyone needs to do what they feel is best and no one else has the right to tell someone otherwise. Although if I were the mom I would be devastated.  \n\nIf the timing truly couldn't be helped than NTA on the rest but it's borderline.  \n\nMy brother got married late, he was 40 and we all thought he would always be a bachelor.  So it was a BIG DEAL. His wife was also 40 and it was her dirt marriage as well so they went all out. They spent a year of intense planning. \nI was married and divorced and living with my best friend (btw congrats, marrying your best friend is the best thing in the whole world), love of my life, father of my children. We didn't care about making it official. Wr were until death do us part no matter what a piece of paper said. We had planned a life together, we intentionally had kids together, we were in our 30s and not some kids. \nBut my husband got sick and soon it became an issue when he would be incapacitated in the hospital and the simplest thing like paying bills that were in his name became a nightmare. Not.to mention making decisions about his health. I won't even go into the life and death decisions that had to be made (do we do A where he might die on the table or have his memory erased or do we do B and he might be paralyzed forever). It came down to going to the lawyer and spending hundreds to draw up the papers or to spend 8 bucks on the wedding license and throw a party. \n\nWe already considered ourselves husband and wife so it was a no brainer. We needed the world to recognize what we were snd that was the obvious choice. \n\nThe problem was he was awaiting a surgery they didn't expect him to live through. The top surgeon in that specialty in the country was the only one who would attempt the surgery. And we had to travel half way across the country for it. Everyone else had turned him away telling him to take the few weeks he had left with his family. (The surgery worked that time but we lost the batter 3 years later). We didn't know when the surgery was going to be and we begged the docs to let him out of the hospital while he waited. \nThey didn't want to let him but finally relented with a huge list that if any one of those things were to happen we had to go straight to the hospital. \n\nMy husband was not getting married in the hospital church. He had spent too much of his life in hospitals. So when they let him out it was our only chance before the surgery... which he had a 90% chance of dying on the table. \n\nI planned the wedding in 5 days. 20 people including us and the kids in the back yard. \n\nUnfortunately it was the weekend before my brother's wedding. \n\nI felt SO BAD. Of course my brother and his wife understood. And we kept things as quiet as possible. It couldn't be helped... the timing of it. And my brothers wedding was beautiful and perfect and they celebrate 10 years in a week and a few days. \n\nI didn't just tell that very long story for the point of Some Things Can't Be Helped just go with it. \n\nThe point is my brother and his wife celebrate 10 years with their 7 year old miracle child. They have a lovely house and are currently putting a pool in. She just got promoted. They have a good life. \n\nMy husband survived that surgery but not the next one. By then wr had been playing whack a mole with his health issues for years and it eventually caught up with him.\n\nI ended up a widow with 3 small kids by 40. \n\nNo one resents the fact I had my wedding 1 wrek before my brother's.  \n\nYou married your best friend. It sounds like a truly romantic and amazing thing. I married my best friend i had had since i was q6 andnlike youbwe disnt become a couple until much later in life and I wouldn't trade the time we had for anything. \n\nThese things are so petty. I look back at stuff and it's ridiculous that it was ever an issue.  In the long run it will the the marriages not the weddings that matter. \n\nHopefully you and you sister will enjoy long happy marriages and you guys can bond over finding your person around the same time and in 50 years you can all celebrate.  Or one or both won't make it and then it's moot because blood is thicker than water. \nBut I think you will make it! You went a very long way to reconnect, I think you had an inkling lol. I wish you the very very best.\n\nPlease try to think of others feelings in your free wheeling life style ok?", "NTA, I'm pretty sure that you would have \"stolen her thunder\" even if you hadn't gotten married.

I mean, you're married ffs, it's part of your identity and taking your wedding ring off just because she thinks someone might what? Talk to you about it instead of paying 100% attention to her is pathetic. Not only that, it's like saying to your husband, do you mind if for the wedding we look as if we're single? Wtf, that's such a slap in the face to both of you. Is there more in it than just her fear of you hijacking her wedding? Is she ashamed of your marriage?

He should have been willing to do one small thing to make it right.", "I disagree with \"It also wouldn't have made much difference if he'd announced it 3 months ago'. Yes, yes it would have. \n\nThat would have given his family 3 whole months to let the news sink in. They could have had phone conversations or face times about the whole thing and why it happened, why they weren't included in the wedding, etc etc, 3 whole months is a really long time to get through some big, tough conversations. \n\n2 Weeks gives them NO time, ZERO time to actually let the news sink in or to absorb it. Then they just show up and don't bother to have a supper before the rehersal to get all the questions out. If they had 3 months, at least the family could have asked at least a few of the questions already and it would perhaps still be bittersweet, but not as fresh news and as hard a pill to swallow. \n\nI know from personal experience that the amount of time from sinking in, absorption and being able to have conversations about it is much more than two weeks. 3 months is a lot of time for the family to absorb it a bit, and I'm sure some people would still have issues and words to say, but it wouldn't have been so heavy as just showing up two weeks after announcing your elopement.", "I agree. Weddings, baby showers, etc are often where people who care about each other but haven\u2019t seen each other for some time reunite. They spend lots of time catching up. Weddings happen, relationships start, all this *stuff* that other people learn about and celebrate. It happens and I don\u2019t think it pulls focus from the bride and groom. No one talks during the ceremony or suddenly stops gushing over the bride. In the case of pregnancies, what if someone hasn\u2019t yet announced but has started to show. People will ask about the bump (they will, it just is what it is). I don\u2019t think someone should lie and say they aren\u2019t pregnant just because it\u2019s a wedding. Happiness multiples and the focus of the event *is* still the bride and groom. The wedding ring is like the baby bump here (except you could poke a hole in this analogy easily, since one you choose to wear and one just shows) Someone is bound to learn about OP\u2019s marriage for the first time at the event, they\u2019re going to be happy, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault\u2026If OP took the microphone and formally announced his marriage, ya that\u2019d be a dick move and steaming the thunder.

The wedding was still his sister\u2019s + her partner\u2019s day! \n\nBut I will note, since she asked you not to wear the ring, even though it may seem silly/unfair to you, you could have just not worn the ring to be nice to her OP. It wouldn\u2019t have taken that much out of you, you could still love on your husband all night. I mean, I think it\u2019s silly too but I would have just not worn my ring to appease her.

It's batshit what you consider \"things\" in the \"things\" that aught to revolve around the couple.\n\nHolding off on engagement/marriage until someone else follows through with their drawn out self aggrandizing wedding affair is batshit. Which is what not wearing the ring intends to do. It says, you should not have been married faster than I was, before I was once I got engaged, or in the low key manner you did such that people don't know and your ring will let them know. That is quite literally insisting that someone puts their life on hold, or hides their life if they don't fit into your same path, to the effect that you have to pretend you're something you're not at an event celebrating that thing and promoting the wonderful and important thing that marriage is. It's a farce; \"hide your marriage while we celebrate mine\". Either marriage is nothing and it's no big deal to hide, in which case her marriage is nothing and it shouldn't be a big deal he's seen as married at it, or it's a big deal and to ask that of him is a big ask and a hugely insulting and massive ask. \n\nIt is simple, he got married, in the way and time frame and manner that fits his life views and importance of celebrating. That meant it happened before hers could, in accordance with what she places value in in the wedding/marriage process. She's inherently elevating either herself or her view and process on marriage, or just shoving his down, probably both, by having him hide it, and as such is invalidating, as would he by consenting to it, his views and values on the wedding/marriage process. That's batshit. That's not attention grabbing or seeking, that's asking someone to hide who they are, marriage is an augmentation of ones self into a partnership. It is you, you are one. That's the whole fucking point. She's shutting on marriage itself asking him to hide it at worst, at best she's just shitting on his marriage because it happened in a different way. \n\nWomen are obsessed with their days, birth weeks, birth months sometimes.

You missed the point. Did you read any of it where it mentions the relationships. The communication. The lack thereof in general? The basically go with the flow, it's all pretty casual not a big deal to tell everyone etc, over seas and just arrived home? That's why the news just came out. The reality is he got married from zero relationship in the period she was planning her wedding. That's the issue. He's on a different path. Why would he announce anything? You're just missing who this person is. They're not connected like others. That's how they live. Asking him to pretend he hasn't changed is ridiculous.\n\nAnd no, that's not misogynistic, it's ridiculous, no men go around having birthday weeks, groomsdays, etc etc etc. No wedding posts on here about stealing the groom's spot light. The reality is that most people are sensible about these days and attention fixation and being hyper important and celebrated, but generally speaking those that are obsessed with being made a big deal over, repeatedly are more often women. Birthweeks, birthmonths in and cases, bridal showers, gender reveals, baby showers, engagement parties, none of these tend to focus on the groom's/dad's or babies, they're being spun into events for the bride's/moms to be centers of attention. I am not saying I hate anyone for this, I'm not saying all women or even most do this, but I'm saying those that do this attention seeking obsessive behavior that imposes on those around them and is generally unhealthy and misplaced is predominantly women and I just think it's tooooo much and it's destructive. I don't hate or detest those people or women, that's why it's not misogyny as it's generally true observations and my feeling toward it is it's destructive and counter productive to healthy relationships and families but not detest. I'm not prejudging that women all or lots do this, not even slightly saying that, but those that are have lost sight of the meanings and value of those events because they've become obsessed with attention and being celebrated. Men do it to but around very different events. I mean birthmonths, there are only 12 in a year and some people wanna have it be all about them. That's the insane shit I'm talking about. I'm not talking about wanting to be celebrated at your wedding in general, but being so obsessed with being celebrated that you demand someone else hide their marital status at your wedding due to their alternative marital path/timeline\n\nI'm definitely judging attention seekers, not women in general, and believe me I would say men have a lot more pervasive shit I judge us for. Holding prejudice towards women is misogynistic, holding prejudice towards attention obsessed people isn't, and don't get me wrong there are just very different ways that attention obsessed men seek it than birthweeks, wedding stuff, baby stuff. I'd say in general it's an equal split gender wise. But men just don't want attention for the same accomplishments", "\u201cI\u2019m brutally honest\u2026\u201d", "There\u2019s no way any of my siblings would demand something like this because they love me and would be incredibly happy for me and would want to make a big deal about it.

They\u2019re adults, not 5 year olds.", "Waiting 3.5 months and then emailing with only two weeks to go, while still out of the country and in full knowledge that the next time he will see anyone in person is for the wedding events, is not really trying particularly hard not to disrupt her wedding. It was pretty much guaranteed that it would cause disruption and upset her.\n\nYou don't know that the sister had a wonderful day. OP says *they* enjoyed it and really doesn't seem to care whether his sister did, he doesn't mention it at all. She was upset enough not to speak to her brother all day so it clearly did affect her day.", "The timing matters because he knows his mom would go crazy about it and it'd be the first time he meets his mom in person.\n\nJust because he didn't do it for attention doesn't change the fact that he did suck up all the attention because of his poor planning.", "You aren't the AH for wearing your wedding ring....but honestly you are an AH for choosing to tell your family right before your sisters wedding. You had 4 months to tell them, and you had to have known at the time of getting married about your sisters wedding as I am sure they had a longer period between engagement to marriage. \n\nEloping is fine, and I get perhaps maybe you have a really crappy relationship with your family \\[although from purely what you have written it doesn't sound that way\\]. Maybe you just aren't close to your family, that is fine. Though 4 months and you choose to tell them right before your sisters wedding, giving them zero time to absorb the news or to even ask you questions before hand. \n\nAt the very least you could have had a dinner or lunch before the rehersal dinner to talk to them all about it. I find it hard to believe that you wouldn't have thought that the rehersal dinner would have gone on by without a single question coming your way. \n\nFrom personal experience I understand not wanting a big wedding, not wanting to tell every single person, but unless you are no contact or something with your family I don't understand not telling family at the very least. I am a 'foregetful' person too, but getting married isn't something I believe you could easily forget to tell your family or 'lose track of time' to do. \n\nIt takes time for people to absorb something like an elopement. Takes time to be able to come to terms with it all. It takes several conversations that may be awkward or may not be. It all takes time, and you gave them only two weeks before your sisters planned wedding. I'm not saying don't elope, I'm not saying that your sisters wedding is more important, but I am saying that you had to have known that telling them two weeks before the wedding wasn't sufficient enough.

It's kinda obvious that it'd create drama.\n\nYou claim you are fiercely independent and have a single-track mind, but I think you are just used to doing whatever you want without thinking of other people. \n\nHowever, when your thoughtlessness impacts other people, that is just being inconsiderate and self-centered.", "YTA u ruined her rehearsal dinner, that was supposed to be her and her partners day to share their happiness and love with the family. it seems almost sneaky and conniving that u would wait til her rehearsal dinner to tell the family about it as if u were trying to steal the attention from her. it\u2019s fucked up dude if i were in her position i\u2019d be butt hurt af ab it too. i\u2019m sure she put a lot of time and effort and money into that night just for u to come steal her thunder. could\u2019ve at least waited til the very end of her wedding dude like be so fr.", "Personally, I think you should have waited until after your sister\u2019s wedding (like a few months after) to announce that you got married.\n\nYTA and using your \u201cfiercely independent\u201d personality as an excuse to be \u201cforgetful\u201d is about as sturdy as a house of cards in the middle of a Kansas tornado storm.", "YTA. You realized your shortcoming in discussions with family and still chose not to respect your family that felt you slighted them. \n\nI get wanting to occasionally disappear. I get not being socially similar to family. However, if you completely dismiss their feelings, they\u2019ll likely not continue a relationship with you. \n\nLifelong commitments are to our partners but they also exist with family members (not all but clearly you value yours and those relationships) and sometimes we have to acquiesce when we\u2019ve made a mistake.", "YTA \n\nI don\u2019t even know why you bothered going to your sister\u2019s wedding.

You were thoughtless in the way you hijacked someone else\u2019s special event, that someone else probably paid for. Sending an emails isn\u2019t the same as showing off your new husband in person for the first time.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can ask you to take off your wedding ring, but your sister is probably still mad about you hijacking her rehearsal dinner.\n\nI just want to know what else you did to your sister over the course of her entire childhood.

Your wedding rings are also an announcement of the marriage, and during the reception would spark conversation about your wedding when people who didn't get the email or didn't get a chance to talk to you yet see the rings.

This was a no win scenario and I think OP isn't as close to his family as he's saying...which is rather normal for queer people. We've got, uh, a big part of our lives and identity that makes us feel alienated from them. He probably only told because he'd be seeing people in person.", "I wouldn't even trust this guy saying they were homophobic, to be honest, given how open the mother was in his retelling.\n\nSeveral years ago I ended up in a similar situation. My sister announced her engagement, nearly two months after it happened, on the day our uncle was being removed from life support. The only reason I saw it (I use FB like twice a year) was because I wanted to send my aunt and cousins a message, as phone call logistics internationally were going to be a nightmare. Instead I see sister gushing, posted two hours before, and phoned my mother going \"Mom! You haven't told Sister? How's aunt doing?\" and my mom tells me my sister had known for EIGHT HOURS. She literally went \"Well, I guess everyone will be checking Facebook to see if Uncle has bit it yet, time to have the attention on us! It's just efficient\" and did it. And then proceeded to not tell me about her engagement until two years later, after a cancelled wedding, the death of a shared parent, and then completed wedding. Because she \"forgets to tell people things\" and she's \"prioritising her mental health\" and she's \"fiercely independent\". What this means is that she likes to punish people for any perceived transgression (not taking her side in an argument, her kids being close to you, whatever) and I refuse to go grovelling, so she only talks to me when she needs something. ANYWAY, the reason I mention this is that APPARENTLY she was going around telling relatives I wasn't invited to the wedding because I was homophobic.\n\nI'm queer. Loudly. Every person who knows me loses their shit when I tell this story.\n\nAlllll that said, this story stinks. You can't elope in Ireland, you have to give 3 months notice.

I don\u2019t get it.", "Honestly those sound like the actions of someone with undiagnosed ADHD. I also struggle to maintain connections with people not \"in my line of sight\" as OP put it. That and the impulsivity of getting married without telling family are big signs of it.\n\nObviously ADHD isn't an excuse, but if it's undiagnosed a lack of awareness might cause OP to behave in ways they don't know are seen as selfish.\n\nAll that said, still NTA for wearing his wedding ring.", "The question about the rings is a decoy. \"AITA about this minor thing\" while at the same time ignoring the entire cause of the conflict we are to judge.
