The ceremony was beautiful and I enjoyed myself as much as someone who is famously not a wedding guy could. The dramatics were not quite as enjoyable.\n\nI (27m) hadn't seen my family in a few months, and we've only had a handful of phone calls over the course of those months. It's never on purpose that I pull one of these disappearing acts, it's mostly out of habit. I've been fiercely independent for most of my life and I get easily caught up in whatever I'm doing at the time that makes it hard for me to remember to keep those not in my direct line of sight in the loop. My mother is the same way. (It's also nice visiting around times when big events like this are going on as my mom is prone to hovering whenever I'm home, and this takes some of the spotlight off me.)\n\nI had been in Ireland around 8 months prior to flying in last Thursday. I was originally there to spend two weeks with my best friend who, thanks to the aforementioned one track mindness I possess, I had unfortunately grown apart from within recent years. Ours was a friendship that had started since we were 14 and was one of the most important relationships in my life for over a decade, and I wanted to put more effort into it so I didn't lose it. He was spending time overseas as to reconnect with his heritage since his father's passing, I was already traveling, and my stay obviously turned out to be a lot longer than two weeks.\n\nIt also turned into us getting married. Funny how life works out.\n\nAbout two weeks before our trip the states for my sister's wedding, I sent out a mass email to close family letting them know that me and my husband were married. I wanted to assuage any possibility of us 'stealing any thunder' right from the get go. My mom replied that she was hurt that she wasn't told sooner or allowed to be there, which I understood.\n\nIt seemed her mood flipped by the time we met in person, however. Rehearsal dinner was on Friday, and that was where we all met up for the first time. My mom was overjoyed to see me and my partner and spent a large part of the night telling stories about she had always predicted there was something different about my friendship with him compared to others I was close with in high school. It was a very sweet moment. But at the end of the night, my sister pulled me aside and asked if we would not wear our wedding rings to her ceremony.\n\nI was confused, so I asked why. She said I was taking the attention off her and she was already bitter than I was 'hijacked' her rehearsal dinner. More family might take notice if I wore my ring tomorrow and cause a similar incident. I refused. Like I mentioned before, the ceremony was beautiful but she didn't speak to me for the rest of the weekend and we ended up leaving the reception early.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685566229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wxn28/aita_for_wearing_my_wedding_ring_to_my_sisters/", "score": 1129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She must've been pretty hurt that her rehearsal dinner was all about you getting married. You should've thought that sending an email wouldn't stop any conversation about your surprise wedding right before your sister's... I understand you're a carefree guy, but maybe you could've found a better way/time to let everyone know about your neo-marriage.\n\nEdit: After reading your comments, YTA. Married for 4 months and let's a few know just before the wedding of his sister and still doesn't see any problem with his actions.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re TA, but I don\u2019t understand a lot of this. You seem more like you don\u2019t understand the consequences of your actions than a purposeful asshole. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand why you thought sending everyone an email that you had gotten married two weeks before getting there would have put an end to the \u201cstealing the thunder\u201d concerns. If anything, my mind immediately goes to the opposite. You may have \u201cinformed\u201d everyone beforehand but this is their first chance to ask you all the questions about it. And as it was unexpected and also seemingly fast, people are going to want details and often not care that there\u2019s another event/wedding going on. You even say that your mum spent a large part of the rehearsal dinner talking about your relationship and your marriage because she was so surprised and excited to be presented with this information. Are you confused about why your sister is upset? \n\nI don\u2019t think you needed to remove your rings necessarily because the damage was already done by the time of the wedding, if there was any. But I\u2019m a little bit confused by your actions here and can completely understand why your sister was upset even if she asked for the wrong thing.", "YTA. You were married for three months and you chose to announce your marriage just two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding. Then her rehearsal dinner became you and your spouse\u2019s debut not only as a couple but a married couple. I don\u2019t think people\u2019s lives should be on hold but I do think that when it comes to milestones events like a wedding, the guests of honor should have the entire spotlight to themselves and people shouldn\u2019t take away from that. You had to know that handling things this way was going to take attention away from your sister\u2019s big day.", "YTA, you stole her rehearsal dinner and you waited until two weeks before her wedding to announce hers.", "YTA - Normally asking someone not to wear their wedding ring would be a batshit crazy request but I actually get where your sister is coming from.\n\nYou seem remarkably self-centred and thoughtless of the impact of your actions and behaviour on others. How can you not think that running off to Ireland, getting married to someone you haven\u2019t seen for 14 years and then telling everyone 2 weeks beforehand (despite being married for 4 months!) wouldn\u2019t steal her thunder? Of course they are all going to be more interested in you because what you did was insane and so people will be wanting to talk about that. I think you know it would and that\u2019s why you waited. \n\nThe ring request wasn\u2019t really the big problem but your overall behaviour is.", "Hmm you\u2019re kind of TA. If you\u2019ve been married for 4 months you\u2019ve had a while to tell them and have chosen not to. 2 weeks before you do and then at rehearsal dinner that\u2019s what you\u2019re mother wants to talk about and then at the wedding if people haven\u2019t seen you for a while and given it\u2019s quite sudden people are going to ask questions. You have taken some of the attention away from her day which I don\u2019t think is fair. You could have just gone with your husband and told everyone you were married at a later date. Given you\u2019d waited months to tell them anyway what difference would a few more weeks have made.", "There\u2019s a lot of purely thoughtless people on Reddit lately, and you seem like one of them. You\u2019d been married MONTHS and told your family two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding in the most impersonal way (mass email). Then you go to the wedding, which would be everyone\u2019s FIRST CHANCE to ask you questions about your wedding in person. Of course they\u2019re going to focus on you. You really can\u2019t be bothered to think of others, can you? YTA.", "YTA  - You debuted your marriage at your sister's wedding.", "YTA normally I would say asking to remove wedding rings would be a big no, but I really get what your sister is upset about. You've been married for 4 months, yet wait until 2 weeks before your sister's wedding to email a few select people? Then hijack her rehearsal dinner - it sounds like you were out to ruin the wedding you didn't have. You could have worn the wedding ring on a chain for the night to keep it with you. I don't blame your sister one bit.", "YTA for deciding that your \"one track mind\" is just how you are and that you're not responsible for communicating with your family or planning things that include them. Emailing them to tell them you were married is so exclusionary and impersonal. I get that not everyone wants a big wedding, but you could've had a small party or at least made a phone call to your parents. From what you say, it's not that they were abusive. You were just lazy.\n\nThat said, I don't think you need to not wear your wedding ring to your sister's wedding. Your family's first time meeting your husband is going to naturally have a bit of focus on him regardless of your jewelry or lack thereof. Should've thought about this weeks ago and had a party to intro him then, but it's too late now.", "YTA\n\nYou had 8 months to inform your family you got married, you could have informed your family once you received the wedding invitation, instead you waited 2 weeks before your sister's wedding. And that's what makes you the AH", "YTA, you waited until two weeks before your sister's wedding to tell your family you secretly married your childhood friend in an international trip whirlwind romance four months ago? The least you can do is redirect anyone who starts making her wedding about your new marriage.

Whether you intended to steal the show or not, it doesn't seem like there was any specific reason to cut contact, so, yeah, you should have said something at least shortly after it happened. Would have avoided this whole scenario where it does at least look like you were spotlight stealing.", "YTA", "YTA slightly. maybe should have let the family know sooner that you were married instead of right before your sisters day possibly upstaging her. You had months to tell them. At least you didn\u2019t announce it at the wedding. In that said. Your sister can\u2019t assume everyone holds off their life because she is getting married. It\u2019s not fair for her to ask you to remove your rings. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are married. It\u2019s also not your fault for your mom or others asking about your new marriage. I feel better communication would have prevented your sister from being TA.", "YTA.", "Pretty simple request that wouldn't have hurt you at all. YTA.\n\nId have uninvited you.", "NTA wear your ring with pride. It's not the same as making a huge announcement when you should toast the new couple.", "NTA.  It strikes me as ridiculous to ask others to not wear wedding rings at your wedding reception.", "NAH, it seems like the \"thunder stealing\" would have happened regardless because you don't stop being married without it on but I do get why your sister didn't want you to wear the ring.", "NTA - gasp! God forbid family and friends take a moment to discuss your life in casual conversation at your sister\u2019s wedding. It might be the bride\u2019s \u201cday\u201d but the ones that insist on every single thought be about them have their heads planted firmly up their ass.", "NTA.

It's expected and normal. \n\nThe real instigator here agitate to be your mother, telling all the stories about how she \"just knew\" etc.", "NTA it\u2019s unreasonable to ask some one to remove their wedding ring. But you\u2019re still an asshole in the way you treat your family in general and then say oh it\u2019s just how I am. That\u2019s just code for I don\u2019t care about you, only myself.", "NTA... taking the ring off doesn't mean you aren't married anymore... who wants to tell her that??", "NTA. \n\nYour marriage is just as important as hers. You don't have any plans to make a scene at the wedding, and if someone decides to freak out because they notice you're wearing a ring, thats not your problem. It's unfair, and incredibly disrespectful, for her to ask you to hide your rings because she's jealous.\n\nThat said... In defense of your sister, it sounds like your mom did kind of make a lot of the rehearsal dinner about you, and I can understand your sister feeling like the attention was taken from her that night. Don't get me wrong, I think it's dumb to be upset about, but I get it. But that's something that should be a conversation with your sister and your mom (and I guess maybe you but honestly not really necessary?), so she can voice her feelings and ask her to keep the wedding day about the bride. \n\nI will say that sending an email 2 weeks before the wedding was not the best way to do things. How long had it been since you got married? If it had just happened, then yeah, timing sucks but whatever. If you got married and then sat on it until 2 weeks before the wedding, that's kind of shitty.\n\nYou did nothing *really* wrong and should not hide your wedding rings. I empathize with your sister but her request is totally out of line. You mom didn't do anything bad but should make an effort to focus on your sister for now.", "Is your sister lowkey a bigot?\n\nYou didn\u2019t hijack anything.

Taking off your rings during another wedding is not a reasonable request at all.\n\nNTA", "Wouldn't call you an asshole, neither her a bigot. My guess is her reaction would've been the same if you had married a woman.\nNot justifying her actions, just trying to shed some light. One of my best friends got married 6 years ago to this delightful girl. At least she was delightful until the wedding planning started, the change was unbelievable, holy crap. He almost called the wedding off if she didn't chill. Then the wedding happened, and they've been extremely happy ever since.\n\nI guess my point is, maybe your sister is just one of those legendary bridezillas we think only exist in movies and messed up reddit posts.\n\nAnyways, congrats on marrying your best friend dude!\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add the NTA, duh.", "NTA- you have put an effort into not stealing the thunder by sending out the email. Not wearing your rings is not going to unsend the email. If people mention your nuptials,  its not your fault, but you can kindly redirect them to the bride.", "NTA-You didn\u2019t hijack anything. The wedding was still her day and all about her marriage. Her request was unreasonable.", "NTA. I don't even get this mindset. So what if you just got married? People can talk about more than one event at a function. One doesn't cancel out the other.\n\nPersonally, I'd have thought it would lead to more joy, not less; a double toast at the reception for ex.", "NTA\n\nNo matter what you did (tell in advance, not tell), there were bound to be questions, especially with you being gone for months, even if that is normal for you. Your sister had no right to ask you to not wear your rings. It\u2019s not like you were asking to get married on her wedding day. My family isn\u2019t the greatest, but I can\u2019t imagine telling anyone not to experience their own joy. It should add to, not take away from mine.", "NTA\n\nI think YOU and YOUR spouse being there, together, as a couple, would have drawn attention whether you wore your wedding rings or not. \n\nIs you sister homophobic by any chance?", "NTA because it is ridiculous to ask a married person to not wear their wedding ring. That said, I probably would have taken the ring off because it was a simple way to make your sister happy. Plus if you really wanted to avoid stealing her thunder you would have left the rings off AND waited until well after the wedding to let people know. You obviously weren\u2019t in a rush to tell people, so what\u2019s a few more weeks? In sum, you were a jerk, but her demand was worse.", "This main character syndrome is annoying.     Yeah op could have told people sooner but getting married isn\u2019t a broadway show with the leading roles to be adulated by the audience.   People are coming g to witness a beautiful ceremony and share in your joy!   So what for a minute or two people might be distracted but the focus will revert back.  The bride needs to get over herself.  Op communicate better - maybe this wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.  Your sister maybe emotional and over reacting but you can take some accountability.

I suspect your sister isn't marrying for Love; so she doesn't have the the capacity to understand what she just asked you to do.\n\nI'm also suspicious that your fierce independence is in part an adaptation to having a dramatic needy sibling who is obsessed with being better than other people.\n\nBut that's all in the past... f her.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MARRIAGE!

We hadn't seen each other for about 3 months at the time I came to Ireland to visit him. \n\nNot arguing judgement, just wanted to specify a few things. I definitely wouldn't get married to someone I hadn't seen in over a decade or run off to Ireland without telling anyone. My family knew I was going to visit and I travel a lot as it is.

I had emailed close family but not every single guest in attendance, so seeing the rings would be some people's first introduction to the situation. Still, I don't think it was a totally reasonable request but wanted some outside feedback.", "I think sending the email did the opposite of mitigating the \u201cthunder stealing\u201d and that\u2019s the issue. Sending it two weeks out especially under the circumstances of the relationship and the wedding would engender more questions than less.

The more I think about it and the more insensitive you seem to be. I would've been more than pissed was I your sister. And I don't think it's about bigotry at all, It's about not taking into consideration other people, you should think a bit more about others.", "Yeah... I appreciate that OP tried, but two weeks was not nearly enough time to lessen the \"big news\" impact of this. Also I think OP should have done more to redirect attention at the rehearsal dinner. \"Thanks mom, it is exciting news but this is Sis's night. Husband and I will come over later/ after/ whenever and we can talk all about it.\" \n\nThat said, Sis requesting he not wear his ring is stupid and pointless. People are just as -- if not more -- likely to hear about the marriage from mom or literally anybody else at the rehearsal dinner as they are to ask because they happened to spot a ring. \n\nSo I don't think that OP was wrong to wear it, but I do think he made mistakes in other ways... ESH maybe?", "Even if OP didn\u2019t do it deliberately, it takes very little effort to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize this is the effect my email will have.

And realistically, she made that request likely because she was pissed and didn\u2019t see another option that would make her feel better. Doesn\u2019t make the request reasonable, but I get it. I think OP fucked up even if he didn\u2019t intend to and his sister might even be upset that he withheld that he got married from her as much as that her rehearsal dinner turned into mums soapbox to talk about her son and his new husband. \n\nI agree though, OP could have redirected mum at the rehearsal dinner.

Lifelong commitments are not something to be taken lightly. I think I perceive it differently than most.\n\nBut I do understand why she was hurt. I know weddings are a huge thing for some people even if they aren't for me.

I'll make sure to clear that up.", "Making this into \u201cshe cares a lot about weddings so I get why she was upset\u201d negates a lot of the impact your actions had here. Maybe the nonchalance you have and making it about her response to the situation is part of what is upsetting to her. It seems really self-centered and lacking in social skills to not understand that this was a possible impact. \n\nAnd as an aside, do you not think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s a little upset that you don\u2019t care enough about her to tell her you got married until 4 months after the fact? Just because everyone else was happy about it doesn\u2019t mean she was.", "But you should've thought about it before. More thoroughly than sending an email to your closest family 2 weeks before you've got to meet for your sister wedding.

You would've let everyone know way before than last minute or tried to keep it a secret even tho you were uncomfortable not wearing your ring so that her wedding day would've been for her wedding only.

I've been living mostly on my own since I was 14 as I went to a boarding school in another state. I've been working part time and traveling by myself since I was 15. My mom's focus largely shifted to her career around that time since both of her kids were out of the house. She and I are alike in the way that we focus head-on on one thing at a time. So, we typically email or text somewhere around once a month to catch up (sometimes more, sometimes less obviously) and then have longer phone calls every few months.

Myself and my family lead different lives and this is a system that works for us. \n\nWith that said, I definitely should have told them about us getting married before it happened.

My husband and I aren't wedding people, we didn't want something big. My mother, on the other hand, lives for a wedding.

So if someone had waited that three months and then announced their pregnancy two weeks before a wedding, would that be a problem?\n\nTo me? No. To others? Maybe. I guess the overarching idea here is that I should have checked with my sister. There is no one size fits all timeline for when it's acceptable to say these things. Weeks in advance seems like enough time to me, but as others in the comments and my sister have clearly displayed, it is not enough time for them. So I should've just asked her when she thought the best time would be and went from there, I suppose.
