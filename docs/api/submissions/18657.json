The ceremony was beautiful and I enjoyed myself as much as someone who is famously not a wedding guy could. The dramatics were not quite as enjoyable.\n\nI (27m) hadn't seen my family in a few months, and we've only had a handful of phone calls over the course of those months. It's never on purpose that I pull one of these disappearing acts, it's mostly out of habit. I've been fiercely independent for most of my life and I get easily caught up in whatever I'm doing at the time that makes it hard for me to remember to keep those not in my direct line of sight in the loop. My mother is the same way. (It's also nice visiting around times when big events like this are going on as my mom is prone to hovering whenever I'm home, and this takes some of the spotlight off me.)\n\nI had been in Ireland around 8 months prior to flying in last Thursday. I was originally there to spend two weeks with my best friend who, thanks to the aforementioned one track mindness I possess, I had unfortunately grown apart from within recent years. Ours was a friendship that had started since we were 14 and was one of the most important relationships in my life for over a decade, and I wanted to put more effort into it so I didn't lose it. He was spending time overseas as to reconnect with his heritage since his father's passing, I was already traveling, and my stay obviously turned out to be a lot longer than two weeks.\n\nIt also turned into us getting married. Funny how life works out.\n\nAbout two weeks before our trip the states for my sister's wedding, I sent out a mass email to close family letting them know that me and my husband were married. I wanted to assuage any possibility of us 'stealing any thunder' right from the get go. My mom replied that she was hurt that she wasn't told sooner or allowed to be there, which I understood.\n\nIt seemed her mood flipped by the time we met in person, however. Rehearsal dinner was on Friday, and that was where we all met up for the first time. My mom was overjoyed to see me and my partner and spent a large part of the night telling stories about she had always predicted there was something different about my friendship with him compared to others I was close with in high school. It was a very sweet moment. But at the end of the night, my sister pulled me aside and asked if we would not wear our wedding rings to her ceremony.\n\nI was confused, so I asked why. She said I was taking the attention off her and she was already bitter than I was 'hijacked' her rehearsal dinner. More family might take notice if I wore my ring tomorrow and cause a similar incident. I refused. Like I mentioned before, the ceremony was beautiful but she didn't speak to me for the rest of the weekend and we ended up leaving the reception early.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685566229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wxn28/aita_for_wearing_my_wedding_ring_to_my_sisters/", "score": 3287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She must've been pretty hurt that her rehearsal dinner was all about you getting married. You should've thought that sending an email wouldn't stop any conversation about your surprise wedding right before your sister's... I understand you're a carefree guy, but maybe you could've found a better way/time to let everyone know about your neo-marriage.\n\nEdit: After reading your comments, YTA.

You seem more like you don\u2019t understand the consequences of your actions than a purposeful asshole. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand why you thought sending everyone an email that you had gotten married two weeks before getting there would have put an end to the \u201cstealing the thunder\u201d concerns. If anything, my mind immediately goes to the opposite. You may have \u201cinformed\u201d everyone beforehand but this is their first chance to ask you all the questions about it. And as it was unexpected and also seemingly fast, people are going to want details and often not care that there\u2019s another event/wedding going on. You even say that your mum spent a large part of the rehearsal dinner talking about your relationship and your marriage because she was so surprised and excited to be presented with this information. Are you confused about why your sister is upset? \n\nI don\u2019t think you needed to remove your rings necessarily because the damage was already done by the time of the wedding, if there was any. But I\u2019m a little bit confused by your actions here and can completely understand why your sister was upset even if she asked for the wrong thing.", "YTA. You were married for three months and you chose to announce your marriage just two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding. Then her rehearsal dinner became you and your spouse\u2019s debut not only as a couple but a married couple. I don\u2019t think people\u2019s lives should be on hold but I do think that when it comes to milestones events like a wedding, the guests of honor should have the entire spotlight to themselves and people shouldn\u2019t take away from that. You had to know that handling things this way was going to take attention away from your sister\u2019s big day.", "YTA, you stole her rehearsal dinner and you waited until two weeks before her wedding to announce hers.", "YTA - Normally asking someone not to wear their wedding ring would be a batshit crazy request but I actually get where your sister is coming from.\n\nYou seem remarkably self-centred and thoughtless of the impact of your actions and behaviour on others. How can you not think that running off to Ireland, getting married to someone you haven\u2019t seen for 14 years and then telling everyone 2 weeks beforehand (despite being married for 4 months!) wouldn\u2019t steal her thunder? Of course they are all going to be more interested in you because what you did was insane and so people will be wanting to talk about that. I think you know it would and that\u2019s why you waited. \n\nThe ring request wasn\u2019t really the big problem but your overall behaviour is.", "Hmm you\u2019re kind of TA. If you\u2019ve been married for 4 months you\u2019ve had a while to tell them and have chosen not to. 2 weeks before you do and then at rehearsal dinner that\u2019s what you\u2019re mother wants to talk about and then at the wedding if people haven\u2019t seen you for a while and given it\u2019s quite sudden people are going to ask questions. You have taken some of the attention away from her day which I don\u2019t think is fair. You could have just gone with your husband and told everyone you were married at a later date. Given you\u2019d waited months to tell them anyway what difference would a few more weeks have made.", "There\u2019s a lot of purely thoughtless people on Reddit lately, and you seem like one of them. You\u2019d been married MONTHS and told your family two weeks before your sister\u2019s wedding in the most impersonal way (mass email). Then you go to the wedding, which would be everyone\u2019s FIRST CHANCE to ask you questions about your wedding in person. Of course they\u2019re going to focus on you. You really can\u2019t be bothered to think of others, can you? YTA.", "YTA  - You debuted your marriage at your sister's wedding.", "YTA normally I would say asking to remove wedding rings would be a big no, but I really get what your sister is upset about. You've been married for 4 months, yet wait until 2 weeks before your sister's wedding to email a few select people? Then hijack her rehearsal dinner - it sounds like you were out to ruin the wedding you didn't have. You could have worn the wedding ring on a chain for the night to keep it with you. I don't blame your sister one bit.", "YTA for deciding that your \"one track mind\" is just how you are and that you're not responsible for communicating with your family or planning things that include them. Emailing them to tell them you were married is so exclusionary and impersonal. I get that not everyone wants a big wedding, but you could've had a small party or at least made a phone call to your parents. From what you say, it's not that they were abusive. You were just lazy.\n\nThat said, I don't think you need to not wear your wedding ring to your sister's wedding. Your family's first time meeting your husband is going to naturally have a bit of focus on him regardless of your jewelry or lack thereof. Should've thought about this weeks ago and had a party to intro him then, but it's too late now.", "YTA\n\nYou had 8 months to inform your family you got married, you could have informed your family once you received the wedding invitation, instead you waited 2 weeks before your sister's wedding. And that's what makes you the AH", "YTA, you waited until two weeks before your sister's wedding to tell your family you secretly married your childhood friend in an international trip whirlwind romance four months ago? The least you can do is redirect anyone who starts making her wedding about your new marriage.

Whether you intended to steal the show or not, it doesn't seem like there was any specific reason to cut contact, so, yeah, you should have said something at least shortly after it happened. Would have avoided this whole scenario where it does at least look like you were spotlight stealing.", "YTA", "YTA slightly. maybe should have let the family know sooner that you were married instead of right before your sisters day possibly upstaging her. You had months to tell them. At least you didn\u2019t announce it at the wedding. In that said. Your sister can\u2019t assume everyone holds off their life because she is getting married. It\u2019s not fair for her to ask you to remove your rings. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are married. It\u2019s also not your fault for your mom or others asking about your new marriage. I feel better communication would have prevented your sister from being TA.", "YTA.", "Pretty simple request that wouldn't have hurt you at all. YTA.\n\nId have uninvited you.", "NTA wear your ring with pride. It's not the same as making a huge announcement when you should toast the new couple.", "NTA.  It strikes me as ridiculous to ask others to not wear wedding rings at your wedding reception.", "NAH, it seems like the \"thunder stealing\" would have happened regardless because you don't stop being married without it on but I do get why your sister didn't want you to wear the ring.", "NTA - gasp! God forbid family and friends take a moment to discuss your life in casual conversation at your sister\u2019s wedding. It might be the bride\u2019s \u201cday\u201d but the ones that insist on every single thought be about them have their heads planted firmly up their ass.", "NTA.

It's expected and normal. \n\nThe real instigator here agitate to be your mother, telling all the stories about how she \"just knew\" etc.", "NTA it\u2019s unreasonable to ask some one to remove their wedding ring. But you\u2019re still an asshole in the way you treat your family in general and then say oh it\u2019s just how I am. That\u2019s just code for I don\u2019t care about you, only myself.", "NTA... taking the ring off doesn't mean you aren't married anymore... who wants to tell her that??", "NTA. \n\nYour marriage is just as important as hers. You don't have any plans to make a scene at the wedding, and if someone decides to freak out because they notice you're wearing a ring, thats not your problem. It's unfair, and incredibly disrespectful, for her to ask you to hide your rings because she's jealous.\n\nThat said... In defense of your sister, it sounds like your mom did kind of make a lot of the rehearsal dinner about you, and I can understand your sister feeling like the attention was taken from her that night. Don't get me wrong, I think it's dumb to be upset about, but I get it. But that's something that should be a conversation with your sister and your mom (and I guess maybe you but honestly not really necessary?), so she can voice her feelings and ask her to keep the wedding day about the bride. \n\nI will say that sending an email 2 weeks before the wedding was not the best way to do things. How long had it been since you got married? If it had just happened, then yeah, timing sucks but whatever. If you got married and then sat on it until 2 weeks before the wedding, that's kind of shitty.\n\nYou did nothing *really* wrong and should not hide your wedding rings. I empathize with your sister but her request is totally out of line. You mom didn't do anything bad but should make an effort to focus on your sister for now.", "Is your sister lowkey a bigot?\n\nYou didn\u2019t hijack anything.

My guess is her reaction would've been the same if you had married a woman.\nNot justifying her actions, just trying to shed some light. One of my best friends got married 6 years ago to this delightful girl. At least she was delightful until the wedding planning started, the change was unbelievable, holy crap. He almost called the wedding off if she didn't chill. Then the wedding happened, and they've been extremely happy ever since.\n\nI guess my point is, maybe your sister is just one of those legendary bridezillas we think only exist in movies and messed up reddit posts.\n\nAnyways, congrats on marrying your best friend dude!\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add the NTA, duh.", "NTA- you have put an effort into not stealing the thunder by sending out the email. Not wearing your rings is not going to unsend the email. If people mention your nuptials,  its not your fault, but you can kindly redirect them to the bride.", "NTA-You didn\u2019t hijack anything. The wedding was still her day and all about her marriage. Her request was unreasonable.", "NTA. I don't even get this mindset. So what if you just got married? People can talk about more than one event at a function. One doesn't cancel out the other.\n\nPersonally, I'd have thought it would lead to more joy, not less; a double toast at the reception for ex.", "NTA\n\nNo matter what you did (tell in advance, not tell), there were bound to be questions, especially with you being gone for months, even if that is normal for you. Your sister had no right to ask you to not wear your rings. It\u2019s not like you were asking to get married on her wedding day. My family isn\u2019t the greatest, but I can\u2019t imagine telling anyone not to experience their own joy. It should add to, not take away from mine.", "NTA\n\nI think YOU and YOUR spouse being there, together, as a couple, would have drawn attention whether you wore your wedding rings or not. \n\nIs you sister homophobic by any chance?", "NTA because it is ridiculous to ask a married person to not wear their wedding ring. That said, I probably would have taken the ring off because it was a simple way to make your sister happy. Plus if you really wanted to avoid stealing her thunder you would have left the rings off AND waited until well after the wedding to let people know. You obviously weren\u2019t in a rush to tell people, so what\u2019s a few more weeks? In sum, you were a jerk, but her demand was worse.", "This main character syndrome is annoying.     Yeah op could have told people sooner but getting married isn\u2019t a broadway show with the leading roles to be adulated by the audience.   People are coming g to witness a beautiful ceremony and share in your joy!   So what for a minute or two people might be distracted but the focus will revert back.  The bride needs to get over herself.  Op communicate better - maybe this wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.  Your sister maybe emotional and over reacting but you can take some accountability.

I suspect your sister isn't marrying for Love; so she doesn't have the the capacity to understand what she just asked you to do.\n\nI'm also suspicious that your fierce independence is in part an adaptation to having a dramatic needy sibling who is obsessed with being better than other people.\n\nBut that's all in the past... f her.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MARRIAGE!

We hadn't seen each other for about 3 months at the time I came to Ireland to visit him. \n\nNot arguing judgement, just wanted to specify a few things. I definitely wouldn't get married to someone I hadn't seen in over a decade or run off to Ireland without telling anyone. My family knew I was going to visit and I travel a lot as it is.

I had emailed close family but not every single guest in attendance, so seeing the rings would be some people's first introduction to the situation. Still, I don't think it was a totally reasonable request but wanted some outside feedback.", "I think sending the email did the opposite of mitigating the \u201cthunder stealing\u201d and that\u2019s the issue. Sending it two weeks out especially under the circumstances of the relationship and the wedding would engender more questions than less.

The more I think about it and the more insensitive you seem to be. I would've been more than pissed was I your sister. And I don't think it's about bigotry at all, It's about not taking into consideration other people, you should think a bit more about others.", "Yeah... I appreciate that OP tried, but two weeks was not nearly enough time to lessen the \"big news\" impact of this. Also I think OP should have done more to redirect attention at the rehearsal dinner. \"Thanks mom, it is exciting news but this is Sis's night. Husband and I will come over later/ after/ whenever and we can talk all about it.\" \n\nThat said, Sis requesting he not wear his ring is stupid and pointless. People are just as -- if not more -- likely to hear about the marriage from mom or literally anybody else at the rehearsal dinner as they are to ask because they happened to spot a ring. \n\nSo I don't think that OP was wrong to wear it, but I do think he made mistakes in other ways... ESH maybe?", "Even if OP didn\u2019t do it deliberately, it takes very little effort to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize this is the effect my email will have.

I think OP fucked up even if he didn\u2019t intend to and his sister might even be upset that he withheld that he got married from her as much as that her rehearsal dinner turned into mums soapbox to talk about her son and his new husband. \n\nI agree though, OP could have redirected mum at the rehearsal dinner.

Lifelong commitments are not something to be taken lightly. I think I perceive it differently than most.\n\nBut I do understand why she was hurt. I know weddings are a huge thing for some people even if they aren't for me.

I'll make sure to clear that up.", "Making this into \u201cshe cares a lot about weddings so I get why she was upset\u201d negates a lot of the impact your actions had here. Maybe the nonchalance you have and making it about her response to the situation is part of what is upsetting to her. It seems really self-centered and lacking in social skills to not understand that this was a possible impact. \n\nAnd as an aside, do you not think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s a little upset that you don\u2019t care enough about her to tell her you got married until 4 months after the fact? Just because everyone else was happy about it doesn\u2019t mean she was.", "But you should've thought about it before. More thoroughly than sending an email to your closest family 2 weeks before you've got to meet for your sister wedding.

Though if you got married in secret due to famalial pressures and etc (disaproving extended relations and all that) its way more understandable.

Guests talk about more than the bride--catching up with old friends or family, discussing new or growing babies, discussing new partners, food, clothing, jobs, and occasionally politics. I'm just guessing here, but if you don't wear your rings, people will gossip when you dance together--boyfriend? Casual date? Live together? Etc. A ring tells of your commitment to eachother, and the tone of conversations changes dramatically. Congratulations on your wedding! I wish you both much happiness.", "NTA, at least you gave them a bit of prior notice. The wedding sounded like it was nice anyway and it\u2019s understandable that sometimes these things slip your mind, although you probably should have told the fam a bit sooner.", "NTA. The rings are not a distraction to anyone.", "NTA\n\nNot for wearing your ring. My family is of the opinion once you put the ring on you don't take it off unless in extreme circumstances.  Om not that hard core but my mom didn't take hers off NOT ONCE for 20 years until the band had worn against her engagement ring to the point it needed to be fixed. My dad had is on for a similar time frame until they had to cut it off because his fingers were swollen for a medical reason (of course it was repaired and sized) \n\nSo for wearing your wedding ring it's not fair for anyone to ask you to take it off. That's sacred.  \n\nDid you know your sister was getting ready to announce her wedding or was it a total surprise? You should have made it known you were married the minute you knew about her plans. Also you should have sent the email AND called whom ever you think needed a person to person conversation about it. \n\nThe fact that OP did their own thing and didn't tell their family isn't for us to judge. Everyone needs to do what they feel is best and no one else has the right to tell someone otherwise. Although if I were the mom I would be devastated.  \n\nIf the timing truly couldn't be helped than NTA on the rest but it's borderline.  \n\nMy brother got married late, he was 40 and we all thought he would always be a bachelor.  So it was a BIG DEAL. His wife was also 40 and it was her dirt marriage as well so they went all out. They spent a year of intense planning. \nI was married and divorced and living with my best friend (btw congrats, marrying your best friend is the best thing in the whole world), love of my life, father of my children. We didn't care about making it official. Wr were until death do us part no matter what a piece of paper said. We had planned a life together, we intentionally had kids together, we were in our 30s and not some kids. \nBut my husband got sick and soon it became an issue when he would be incapacitated in the hospital and the simplest thing like paying bills that were in his name became a nightmare. Not.to mention making decisions about his health. I won't even go into the life and death decisions that had to be made (do we do A where he might die on the table or have his memory erased or do we do B and he might be paralyzed forever). It came down to going to the lawyer and spending hundreds to draw up the papers or to spend 8 bucks on the wedding license and throw a party. \n\nWe already considered ourselves husband and wife so it was a no brainer. We needed the world to recognize what we were snd that was the obvious choice. \n\nThe problem was he was awaiting a surgery they didn't expect him to live through. The top surgeon in that specialty in the country was the only one who would attempt the surgery. And we had to travel half way across the country for it. Everyone else had turned him away telling him to take the few weeks he had left with his family. (The surgery worked that time but we lost the batter 3 years later). We didn't know when the surgery was going to be and we begged the docs to let him out of the hospital while he waited. \nThey didn't want to let him but finally relented with a huge list that if any one of those things were to happen we had to go straight to the hospital. \n\nMy husband was not getting married in the hospital church. He had spent too much of his life in hospitals. So when they let him out it was our only chance before the surgery... which he had a 90% chance of dying on the table. \n\nI planned the wedding in 5 days. 20 people including us and the kids in the back yard. \n\nUnfortunately it was the weekend before my brother's wedding. \n\nI felt SO BAD. Of course my brother and his wife understood. And we kept things as quiet as possible. It couldn't be helped... the timing of it. And my brothers wedding was beautiful and perfect and they celebrate 10 years in a week and a few days. \n\nI didn't just tell that very long story for the point of Some Things Can't Be Helped just go with it. \n\nThe point is my brother and his wife celebrate 10 years with their 7 year old miracle child. They have a lovely house and are currently putting a pool in. She just got promoted. They have a good life. \n\nMy husband survived that surgery but not the next one. By then wr had been playing whack a mole with his health issues for years and it eventually caught up with him.\n\nI ended up a widow with 3 small kids by 40. \n\nNo one resents the fact I had my wedding 1 wrek before my brother's.  \n\nYou married your best friend. It sounds like a truly romantic and amazing thing. I married my best friend i had had since i was q6 andnlike youbwe disnt become a couple until much later in life and I wouldn't trade the time we had for anything. \n\nThese things are so petty. I look back at stuff and it's ridiculous that it was ever an issue.  In the long run it will the the marriages not the weddings that matter. \n\nHopefully you and you sister will enjoy long happy marriages and you guys can bond over finding your person around the same time and in 50 years you can all celebrate.  Or one or both won't make it and then it's moot because blood is thicker than water. \nBut I think you will make it! You went a very long way to reconnect, I think you had an inkling lol. I wish you the very very best.\n\nPlease try to think of others feelings in your free wheeling life style ok?", "NTA, I'm pretty sure that you would have \"stolen her thunder\" even if you hadn't gotten married.

Talk to you about it instead of paying 100% attention to her is pathetic. Not only that, it's like saying to your husband, do you mind if for the wedding we look as if we're single? Wtf, that's such a slap in the face to both of you. Is there more in it than just her fear of you hijacking her wedding? Is she ashamed of your marriage?

Yes, yes it would have. \n\nThat would have given his family 3 whole months to let the news sink in. They could have had phone conversations or face times about the whole thing and why it happened, why they weren't included in the wedding, etc etc, 3 whole months is a really long time to get through some big, tough conversations. \n\n2 Weeks gives them NO time, ZERO time to actually let the news sink in or to absorb it. Then they just show up and don't bother to have a supper before the rehersal to get all the questions out. If they had 3 months, at least the family could have asked at least a few of the questions already and it would perhaps still be bittersweet, but not as fresh news and as hard a pill to swallow. \n\nI know from personal experience that the amount of time from sinking in, absorption and being able to have conversations about it is much more than two weeks. 3 months is a lot of time for the family to absorb it a bit, and I'm sure some people would still have issues and words to say, but it wouldn't have been so heavy as just showing up two weeks after announcing your elopement.", "I agree. Weddings, baby showers, etc are often where people who care about each other but haven\u2019t seen each other for some time reunite. They spend lots of time catching up. Weddings happen, relationships start, all this *stuff* that other people learn about and celebrate. It happens and I don\u2019t think it pulls focus from the bride and groom. No one talks during the ceremony or suddenly stops gushing over the bride. In the case of pregnancies, what if someone hasn\u2019t yet announced but has started to show. People will ask about the bump (they will, it just is what it is). I don\u2019t think someone should lie and say they aren\u2019t pregnant just because it\u2019s a wedding. Happiness multiples and the focus of the event *is* still the bride and groom. The wedding ring is like the baby bump here (except you could poke a hole in this analogy easily, since one you choose to wear and one just shows) Someone is bound to learn about OP\u2019s marriage for the first time at the event, they\u2019re going to be happy, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault\u2026If OP took the microphone and formally announced his marriage, ya that\u2019d be a dick move and steaming the thunder.

The wedding was still his sister\u2019s + her partner\u2019s day! \n\nBut I will note, since she asked you not to wear the ring, even though it may seem silly/unfair to you, you could have just not worn the ring to be nice to her OP. It wouldn\u2019t have taken that much out of you, you could still love on your husband all night. I mean, I think it\u2019s silly too but I would have just not worn my ring to appease her.

Even if he has anything it doesn't exempt him from being an asshole.", "I very much agree. But then I was the type of person to tell all my wedding guests to use my photographer to take photos of them looking amazing in their black tie outfits and then actually send copies to them with their thank you card\u2026 so I seem to be an odd one out.", "that\u2019s facts. none of the ppl in this comments section would\u2019ve survived like so much as 10-20 years ago", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting. I think OP\u2019s *intent* was to **not** cause an issue, but it backfired and did. So this seems like a case of impact vs. intent.", "Because he's \"carefree\"", "I have forgotten to tell close family members very important things. I've never got married, so I can't give you 100% certain answer on that.\n\nSome people just work differently to others. Some are on the extremes of that kind of stuff. I find it VERY hard to remember to do things that aren't right in front of me, including contacting family members that I'm very close to when we are together.", "Your family can think what they want, but unless you're going to mind control your mother, that's on her. I'd probably also rather let her get it out of her system than chance having people gossiping and trying to figure out what's going on at the actual wedding.", "If you want to start prioritising opinions, then who's opinion do you think is most important when it comes to OP's wedding ring? Maybe OP and his husband, and not his sister?", "Should they have even gone to the wedding, given the fact that he hadn\u2019t told his family he got married? If he showed up to the wedding with his husband, there was gonna be a fuss. \n\nShowing up without his husband and sans ring and pretending to be single was the only way there wouldn\u2019t have been a fuss about him being married.", "It's quite a bit different, but even still, people shouldnt give so much of a fuck about these things", "If you think my happy news is stealing your sPeCiAl DaY, you\u2019re an a-hole", "Glad to see someone else thinking the same. Outside of the ceremony, weddings tend to be a \"catch up time\" and every convo is often not centered at the couple. I think people commenting that he could've announced it months prior or after her wedding are quite neglectful in accounting what other guests would ask him after disappearing for months. No one is obliged to tell others their personal relationships and their marriage. When OP realized the wedding was coming soon he decided to come out with it so it wouldn't come out durning questionnaires at the actual wedding.", "I\u2019m getting my psych degree so I\u2019m not totally lost here, especially with ADHD myself. And personally? I don\u2019t think anyone is obligated to give that information anyways, neurodivergent or otherwise. But saying that his \u201cone track mind bs\u201d isn\u2019t legit is just annoying, here-say, and totally unrelated. People\u2019s obsession with getting all the information they want from other people just because they feel entitled to it right now is so weird and petty, especially when it\u2019s only in the last 20-ish years this would even be customary \u2014 he was in a different country. (Edited to add more information)", "But impact is what matters here. Of course this would take attention away from his sister.", "If you ever do get married, what do you think the odds are that your mother will be aware of your wedding having occurred within 120 days of the event having passed?", "I think \u201cthanks mum, that\u2019s really sweet. But let\u2019s focus on sister this weekend and talk about another time.\u201d would suffice. You can\u2019t control other people, but you can do your best to demonstrate that you meant no harm and care enough about your sibling to right your parent in this circumstance.", "I don\u2019t disagree. That\u2019s why I shared what I would do, not what OP necessarily had to do. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA for not taking off his ring. I think he\u2019s TA for everything else, including his attitude in the comments, and that choosing to wear the ring was the icing on the cake.", "He could have asked his sister what she preferred. Or told them when he got married. The options werent \u201cgo to the wedding exactly as it happened\u201d it \u201cdon\u2019t go to the wedding and pretend you\u2019re single\u201d.", "Okay. I have a psych degree. And this is why I don't armchair diagnose. It's not my job or even ethical. \nHe didn't disclose he had any neurodivergent diagnosis. So I'm not going to pretend he does or could. \n\nIt also doesn't mean he isn't being a selfish asshole a few times.", "Also, in a different country where he still spoke to his family. \n\nThis is how the sub works. You judge on what's given.", "Oh I know that impact is what matters here. That\u2019s why I pointed out it seems like a case of impact vs. intent.", "You're asking the wrong question in order to gain some kind of gotcha moment.\n\nI don't see most of my family more than once a year (some less than that). Some of my close family members I haven't planned to see in years, I just see them at family gatherings.\n\nWould I go out of my way to tell them about a wedding they probably wouldn't be able to attend that was being done on a spur of the moment? Probably not.\n\nWould it suddenly occur to me that they didn't know when I was at a family gathering? Definitely could.", "You didn't share what you'd do though, you used a hypothetical \"you\", which implies that's what you think everyone should do. You didn't say \"I think if my partner is more upset...\", which would be you sharing what you would do.", "Asking the sister would be a solid choice. \n\nAs someone who forgets that people even exist if I don\u2019t see them often, I read him not telling his family he was married as an oversight and he realized it might be an issue once he made plans to go to the sister\u2019s wedding. So he couldn\u2019t rewind and tell anyone when he actually got married.", "I\u2019m not one to pretend it couldn\u2019t happen. All I\u2019m saying is that we don\u2019t know that information, and him having those issues isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility. Diagnosis, no diagnosis, undiagnosed issue, or no issue. Calling him on \u201chis bs\u201d just because you think he\u2019s an AH is annoying and, frankly, immature. You\u2019re not making a good point by saying that \u2014 you\u2019re just doing whatever you can to make sure your narrative is extra tight. If he says that\u2019s an issue he and his mom has, take it at face value."]}
