I told her I wasn't comfortable, and I could put my shirt on if she wanted me to, but to please at least wear her bra.

I\u2019m all for women choosing not to wear a bra, but that\u2019s not the same thing as undressing entirely in front of someone who has verbally expressed that they are not okay with it.

America and its protestant ideologies. If dude takes his shirt off there's no reason she can't be comfortable too.
