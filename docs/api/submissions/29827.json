It happens very rarely, and its  good for you to assume beforehand that you are not in that rare category. If a guy demands anything which includes changing your life style, then dump him.

It's OK for your bf to want a gf who doesn't drink, and it's OK for you to want to drink and hang out with your friends who are drinking. Unfortunately, that leads to a fundamental incompatibility. In order to square that, you'd either have to compromise or one would have to give in. If this were an otherwise healthy relationship, it might be worth trying to work that out, but this is not a healthy relationship, and your bf's behavior is pretty shitty. Look at what you wrote. You broke up because you were fighting, and he was very rude to you and called you all kinds of names, said you were an alcoholic, and said that you left him because of alcohol and parties.

That\u2019s not fair to your friends either honestly. They shouldn\u2019t have to worry about your bf getting mad if THEY are having a drink while in your presence. Maybe he just feels a little left out or like you don\u2019t have fun with him like you do them?? \n\nI can totally relate to you though and I\u2019m sorry you are going through that. It\u2019s not fair to you for him to tell you what you are ALLOWED to do like he\u2019s your parent or something. You know your limits and you know what\u2019s right and wrong. A drink now and then with your friends isn\u2019t going to damage your relationship\u2026 him controlling you will.

If he doesn't like that you drink socially sometimes, then he doesn't like you. \n\nYou are so young.  Don't waste time on people that don't love you for ALL that you are.

RUN!!!\n\nIt may not look like it to you, but this is the beginning of an _\u2022abusive relationship\u2022_...\nIt starts with this kind of jealousy and/or control... psychological/emotional abuse which most people can't/don't recognize: trying to manipulate your actions/activities by telling you that if you cared about him you would/wouldn't do x,y,z; trying to isolate you from your support systems (starting with friends first, then family) by telling you they're bad influences, they don't have your best interests at heart, they don't care about you, etc... some guys even go as far as to start drama in the background between you & your family, to force you to choose sides.\nOnce you're isolated, with nowhere else to turn, then the verbal, physical & even financial abuse begins... but you've already gotten a taste of the verbal abuse during that first breakup. If you're not careful, you could end up in a situation so bad where you wanna leave but it's too late to just get up & go and all your support system is gone so there's no one to call.\n\nMy advice OP: get out NOW!!!\ud83d\ude10", "The amount of gaslighting and narcissism that you\u2019re not seeing is the scariest part.

In either case, make sure to communicate with your work/school and see if you could also work from home/distance learn.
