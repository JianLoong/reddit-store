He was okay with it at first but as the time went by he started telling me he doesn\u2019t like and want me doing that and we broke up bacuse we were fighting over it.

After some time he said he was sorry but he really hurt me. \n\nWe got back together and I decided that I\u2019m going to stop drinking and going out completly because I really care about our relationship.

Have in mind he is okay that I hang out with them while they are not drinking but if they are drinking he doesn\u2019t want me to hang out with them even if I don\u2019t drink because he thinks they are bad influence for me. He also doesn\u2019t want me going to any kind of house parties, birthdays and any event if people are drinking. I never had a problem with drinking and that stuff but all this seems to me a little extra. He told me if i hangout with my friendas while they drink that we will not be together. He told me if I can\u2019t do that for him then I don\u2019t care about him enough.\n\nSo please help me, do I just don\u2019t care abut him enough or is he asking too much from me?", "created_utc": 1698483143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17i9mir/aita_for_not_doing_everything_my_bf_wants/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But one thing op. You are 19. You will get many bfs, and you will break up with them. No , the love at first sight, the one relationship that goes into marriage, the perfect relationship, will not happen. It happens very rarely, and its  good for you to assume beforehand that you are not in that rare category. If a guy demands anything which includes changing your life style, then dump him. You need to take a hard look at yourself about why you are allowing a guy you barely know  to run your life.", "It's good that you're aware that alcohol can cause lots of problems. But someone deciding to run your life for you can cause lots of problems. Many people drink without causing any major problems in their lives. \n\nIt's important to pay attention in a relationship to your partner's needs and requests. However, you haven't described requests, you've made it clear that he's ordering you to do these things and he has no right to do this. Being your boyfriend doesn't make him your owner. \n\nYou seem concerned about these behaviours of his, and you should be. It's all going to get worse. He thinks he's got the right to control you and he's already shown he's very good at making you think that problems in the relationship are your fault. \n\nYou get to decide who hang out with, you get to decide whether you drink or not. \n\nHe's asking too much and it has nothing to do with how much you care for him. He's not caring enough for you and your rights and needs. \n\nI hope you re-consider this relationship. There are men out there who will treasure you and respect you - but you won't find them while you're with someone who doesn't respect you\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nAs many other pointed out, those are signs of manipulation and excessive control. First thing in a relationship is mutual trust: if you say that you don't like hanging out too much, and enjoy just a drink once in a while, then there's no reason for him to limit you on this.\n\nThis things usually escalate badly: first no drink, then no hangout with friends who drinks, then no hangout at all.\n\nRed flags a gogo", "You\u2019re young with your whole life ahead of you. Have fun, the only advice I have is watch your drink like a hawk, I\u2019ve had mine spiked. \nDump him, he\u2019s manipulating, abusing and controlling you. If you let him he will control every aspect of your life - and he\u2019ll isolate you from friends and family.", "The only time it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to be \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 with you drinking, or hanging out with friends who are, are if you frequently exceed your limit and endanger yourself or others, if there\u2019s a history of alcoholism/addiction to be wary of or if alcohol makes you a particularly unpleasant person\n\nUntil or unless those apply, where your general health and wellbeing is the _only_ reason for concern, anybody who tries to say you can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t drink or be around those who do can get in the bin", "Break up with him, it\u2019s not about drinking it\u2019s about control, and it won\u2019t stop here. Labelling an occasional drinker an alcoholic was an asshole move, he\u2019s not good partner material, you deserve better.", "Break up with him. He is controlling your social life, which is the first step in abusive behavior. Limiting your interaction with peers and friends. It is not acceptable.", "Classic YTA to yourself situation. This dude is controlling or insecure and he's going to keep moving the goal posts every time you decide to go along with what he says. First you can't drink (which is bullshit) and now you can't be with your friends who drink. If he didn't want to be with a girl that goes out and has a drink with her friends occasionally, then he shouldn't have gotten with you. It's part of who you are and what you do and change that for some dude is silly", "Nta - run far, run fast.  He will manipulate you into a corner where you have nobody and nothing.
