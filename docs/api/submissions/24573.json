My mom, is currently 8 months pregnant and she just had my (half) baby brother Ben, in October of 2021, so he's almost 2. My (full blood) brother Sam (M 14) was with our dad, who lives 8 hours away, all summer, and just got back two days ago.  \nMy stepfather works, so for most of the day, it is just me, my mom, and Ben. I am with Ben in the morning for 2 hours. During this time, I feed him breakfast, change his diaper, and play with him. I also make my mom coffee and breakfast. My mom sleeps during this time. She wakes up around 9:30 and eats breakfast. Around 10, I walk my dog. When I get back, I put Ben to sleep. My mom plays on her PC during this time. When Ben wakes up, I make his lunch and she feeds him. Then, I have to take him outside to walk him. Then, I have to take him to water the plants. I have to fetch whatever my mom needs since she can't go up and down the stairs.  \nOn top of doing all this, I had two online classes I was taking. I also had a sick dog I was taking care of. With Sam gone, most of the house chores fell on me. It's a lot to handle. I never complained about any of it.  \nI don't know if it's the pregnancy, but my mom has been extremely mean. It only takes her 5 minutes after seeing me to start complaining about something I didn't do/did wrong. She constantly calls me lazy and compares me to kids my age who have driver's licenses/jobs. These are things I want, but I literally do not have the time to because of all my jobs at home.  \nThis summer, I wanted to go to see my brother and dad just for a week because I miss them. My mom said no because I had to take care of my dog. Fair, I guess. I used to go downtown to the library and she said I can't go anymore because I didn't do \\[insert chore\\] or she needs someone to help with Ben. Right. I wanted to take myself to the movies. No. I want to go to the fair with my brother Sam. No. Yesterday was college orientation. Not only did she text me while I was there complaining about me not telling her we ran out of dishwasher pods, but when I got home, she ranted at me for 20 minutes about how I always ditch my responsibilities.  \nSchool starts tomorrow and I'm so exhausted and sad. I wanted this to be a fun summer. After yelling at me and then telling me to go buy dishwasher pods last night, my mom made me tell her what was making me so upset. I told her I wasn't ready to share it but she threatened to take away my computer (which I paid for and also need for college) so I did. I told her I was tired of doing everything for her, that I felt underappreciated, and that she and Ben ruined my summer. She said she was more than capable of taking care of Ben on her own and sent me to bed. It's the next day and she won't talk to me. She also won't let me help with Ben. I am a little relieved because it's been a long time since I've had time to myself, but I also feel sort of bad.

Harsh truth is it seems like she\u2019s brushing all her responsibilities onto you and using pregnancy as an excuse.

You only feel guilty because you have been trained that when mom is upset you did something wrong.  That might have been true when you were 4,or 8, but now mom is in the wrong, and she is using guilt and verbal abuse to get you to feel that way.  So you have to break your subconscious programming and that takes time and effort.  You need a new belief.  Something like: Just because she is upset doesn't mean I am wrong.   \n\nEverything you said about her yelling at you, she could be yelling at herself instead.  You aren't lazy, she is. It isn't your job to know about dish pods.  It is hers.  She is the adult.  Everything is her responsibility, including running a loving home.  \n\nShe sounds addicted to anger.  Once the body gets used to the rush of adrenaline, and the cortisol stress response it becomes a chemical addiction.  So she pushes for that fix.  Hence her demanding you tell her what is wrong and threatening you.  \n\nEnjoy the moments of calm.  Things will go back to the way they were soon enough, unfortunately, because unless she does some serious introspection, she won't change.", "NTA, and I suspect she'll quickly get tired of taking care of her own baby and hand him back to you so she can get back to her computer.", "NTA.

The one thing I will say that is counter to other people. If your mom's low energy and crabbiness is atypical behavior, I would not assume it is laziness. She could have important pregnancy complications. It could be diabetes, depression, insomnia etc. And she may need professional support like from a pre or post partum Doula or perinatal psychiatrist.

Tell her want to support her and maintain all relationships with everyone in the house, but you need a break (3-6 months) from the relationship because it has been real hard on you this summer, and you are feeling totally burned out.  If she is receptive to this, I'd tell her its normal she needs support you heard about Doulas and they seem perfect for someone at the end of pregnancy. I'd give her and/or her husband the reference to a local doula agency, and if this goes badly just let her husband know if she emotionally seems to be struggling.
