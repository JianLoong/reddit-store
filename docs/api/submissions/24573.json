{"id": 24573, "submission_id": "15q8dpk", "title": "AITA for telling my mom she and my baby brother ruined my summer?", "selftext": "I (F 16) graduated high school in June. Yes, I graduated early. My mom, is currently 8 months pregnant and she just had my (half) baby brother Ben, in October of 2021, so he's almost 2. My (full blood) brother Sam (M 14) was with our dad, who lives 8 hours away, all summer, and just got back two days ago.  \nMy stepfather works, so for most of the day, it is just me, my mom, and Ben. I am with Ben in the morning for 2 hours. During this time, I feed him breakfast, change his diaper, and play with him. I also make my mom coffee and breakfast. My mom sleeps during this time. She wakes up around 9:30 and eats breakfast. Around 10, I walk my dog. When I get back, I put Ben to sleep. My mom plays on her PC during this time. When Ben wakes up, I make his lunch and she feeds him. Then, I have to take him outside to walk him. Then, I have to take him to water the plants. I have to fetch whatever my mom needs since she can't go up and down the stairs.  \nOn top of doing all this, I had two online classes I was taking. I also had a sick dog I was taking care of. With Sam gone, most of the house chores fell on me. It's a lot to handle. I never complained about any of it.  \nI don't know if it's the pregnancy, but my mom has been extremely mean. It only takes her 5 minutes after seeing me to start complaining about something I didn't do/did wrong. She constantly calls me lazy and compares me to kids my age who have driver's licenses/jobs. These are things I want, but I literally do not have the time to because of all my jobs at home.  \nThis summer, I wanted to go to see my brother and dad just for a week because I miss them. My mom said no because I had to take care of my dog. Fair, I guess. I used to go downtown to the library and she said I can't go anymore because I didn't do \\[insert chore\\] or she needs someone to help with Ben. Right. I wanted to take myself to the movies. No. I want to go to the fair with my brother Sam. No. Yesterday was college orientation. Not only did she text me while I was there complaining about me not telling her we ran out of dishwasher pods, but when I got home, she ranted at me for 20 minutes about how I always ditch my responsibilities.  \nSchool starts tomorrow and I'm so exhausted and sad. I wanted this to be a fun summer. After yelling at me and then telling me to go buy dishwasher pods last night, my mom made me tell her what was making me so upset. I told her I wasn't ready to share it but she threatened to take away my computer (which I paid for and also need for college) so I did. I told her I was tired of doing everything for her, that I felt underappreciated, and that she and Ben ruined my summer. She said she was more than capable of taking care of Ben on her own and sent me to bed. It's the next day and she won't talk to me. She also won't let me help with Ben. I am a little relieved because it's been a long time since I've had time to myself, but I also feel sort of bad.

Your mom is currently trying to guilt you and that\u2019s why you feel bad. It\u2019s manipulative.", "NTA - pregnancy is not an excuse to parentify your child. You have too many responsibilities for your age.", "NTA. Who's the mother here? I can't speak on behalf of pregnancy (because I am a man) but I don't see how it's a valid excuse to dump all of your duties on your child.", "NTA. You are a child. She is parentifying you and I am so sorry you are going through this. You seem so helpful and kind and have more responsibilities than a 16 year old should.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you are able to or want to live with your dad, maybe you have to wait until you are able to live on your own but this is extremely unfair to you.\n\nCongratulations on finishing school early, wishing you well.", "Oh my God please tell your dad this. Nta", "NTA.\nPregnancy isn't an excuse for shit behavior or treating other people like garbage. If you're reporting your routine accurately, you do above and beyond what most kids (and at 16, you're technically a kid) do. At your age, your focus should be school, not your younger brother. You deserve time to go to the movies and just be a kid. \nIt's a super AH move to demand that you tell her what's wrong then throw a tantrum when you do. \nLeave the childcare to your mother. Save what you can to get the hell out of that house ASAP.", "NTA - You\u2019re 16 and already graduated high school early, which means you\u2019re already on better pace than other people your age, even if they already \u201chave driver\u2019s licenses and jobs\u201d so that was a dumb comparison for your mother to even make. Harsh truth is it seems like she\u2019s brushing all her responsibilities onto you and using pregnancy as an excuse. There\u2019s nothing wrong with needing some help, but constantly complaining about minor chore inefficiencies while you sleep or play on your PC is a bit hypocritical.", "NTA.  You only feel guilty because you have been trained that when mom is upset you did something wrong.  That might have been true when you were 4,or 8, but now mom is in the wrong, and she is using guilt and verbal abuse to get you to feel that way.  So you have to break your subconscious programming and that takes time and effort.  You need a new belief.  Something like: Just because she is upset doesn't mean I am wrong.   \n\nEverything you said about her yelling at you, she could be yelling at herself instead.  You aren't lazy, she is. It isn't your job to know about dish pods.  It is hers.  She is the adult.  Everything is her responsibility, including running a loving home.  \n\nShe sounds addicted to anger.  Once the body gets used to the rush of adrenaline, and the cortisol stress response it becomes a chemical addiction.  So she pushes for that fix.  Hence her demanding you tell her what is wrong and threatening you.  \n\nEnjoy the moments of calm.  Things will go back to the way they were soon enough, unfortunately, because unless she does some serious introspection, she won't change.", "NTA, and I suspect she'll quickly get tired of taking care of her own baby and hand him back to you so she can get back to her computer.", "NTA. She's been parentifying and abusing you. You are the victim here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
