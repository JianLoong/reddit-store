My little sister (10) and I share a jack and Jill bathroom, I had been noticing slime and spilled wax all over the counter tops and and light switch in my side of the bathroom and had talked to my parents about keeping my little sister out of my side of the bathroom. \n\nWell 2 weeks ago I was supposed to go on a date but couldn\u2019t find any of my makeup, I asked my little sister if she had taken it out of my bathroom and her response was \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you wore makeup\u201d. She\u2019s a good kid so I believed her and figured I must have lost my makeup in the move which pissed me off because I buy expensive stuff since I don\u2019t use it too often. I ended up going to the store that day and just replacing the concealer/foundation (100$) since I couldn\u2019t afford to replace my whole set. \n\nWell this morning I wake up to find my old concealer/foundation sitting right on top of the new ones I just bought. I asked my mom if she had found it somewhere and she said she never touched it. It was pretty obvious that it had leaked or something because there was makeup all on the outside of the bottle and it was way more empty than when I last had it. My mom immediately thinks that my little sister took it and goes into her room to snoop around. \n\nThe next think I know my mom starts tossing the room and I\u2019m trying to get her to stop when she finally dumps out a drawer with not only my makeup but a bunch of makeup of my moms that had gone missing. My sister had taken 2 makeup pallets of mine, 1 I hadn\u2019t even opened yet, brushes, lipstick, eye liner, basically everything. On top of that my mom found open containers of slime and paint that had seeped into the carpet and other shit she had stolen from around the house.\n\nAll of the makeup she took from my mom and I were destroyed, the pallets were mixed together and cracked, brushes had paint in them, lipstick mashed, and everything was covered in slime. When me and my parents confronted her she denied everything, even said that she didn\u2019t use any of the makeup when it was an obvious lie. \n\nMy parents have grounded her for month (no phone, no electronics) and have offered to pay me back but I don\u2019t want them to pay me back I want HER to pay me back. She stole and destroyed nearly 200$ in makeup and lied to my face about it, the worst part is I\u2019ve only been living here for 3 weeks! Her 11th birthday is coming up in 2 months and I\u2019m wondering if i would be the asshole if I made her use her birthday money to pay me back? I feel like taking her birthday money is cruel especially because it\u2019s the only kind of spending money she gets all year and my parents have suggested chores but what chores is she gonna do for me to pay me back? I do more chores than her and I pay rent!\n\nEDIT: My parents are not against her paying me back with her birthday money, they actually suggested it first, they\u2019re leaving it up to me to decide how I want to be payed back. My grandparents give her a 200$ check every birthday on top of toys/art stuff for extra spending money during the year.\n\nTLDR: 10yr old sister stole and destroyed 200$ worth of makeup from me, WIBTA if I made her pay me back with her birthday money?", "created_utc": 1681373689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kh3zc/wibta_i_i_made_my_10yr_old_sister_use_her/", "score": 5735, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her and your parents are legally responsible for damages caused by their child. Hence the money is truly Thier responsibility. How to raise your sister is also their job. If they chose to use her bday money to pay you back then fine. It could probably be seen as proper consequences for her actions. But it's not really your place to decide this.", "The real question is, what is going on with your little sister that she is stealing and lying?  She's obviously acting out for some reason.", "The decision of how to punish your sister is belongs entirely to your parents, not to you.  You can make suggestions, but that's it.  Your mother has offered to replace your make-up, so you will be made whole.  The fact that you want to be made whole by a 10 year old, with very limited access to money, or the ability to earn money, is probably not realistic.\n\nAgain, it is not for you to make your sister fork over her birthday money.  You are the sister, not the parent.", "YTA. Parents are responsible for their underage children's actions, and they've offered to make you whole by paying for the makeup. Anything else is between them and your sister", "YWBTA, yeah...\n\nYou get that $200 to her is like the equivalent of $2,000 or $20,000 to you, right? I mean, she has no income; is she going to get $200 on her birthday?\n\nBut regardless and more importantly, its not your job to parent or punish your sister, and sounds like your parents are on top of it... if they're willing to pay you back, then you should back off...", "YTA - let your parents pay you back and deal with her punishment. She's 10. Kids do dumb shit. She'll be doing chores to pay your parents back for paying you back.", "if you make her pay for it then in my opinion you\u2019re TA , yes her stealing and lying and destroying your stuff is awful but remember she\u2019s 10 years old and her parents are the ones responsible for her so if they pay you back then they pay you back.", "YTA if you do, yes.\n\nShe is 10. You describe her as a good kid you would believe, and you take her word for it when she says she didnt do it at first. She is now stealing and breaking things, then lying even tho she knows you all know. Are none of the adults in the house a bit worried about why she is acting out in this way and what might have changed?\n\nYour anger and frustration is entirely understandable. You splurge on quaity items that goes missing, she lies and destroys it. That isnt ok at all. Your items are being replaced, she is getting consequences (no electronics for a month for a 10yo in this day and age might honestly impact her ability to socialize both in and out of school in a quite significant way), I just dont see why it will help you by going over your parents heads and take away her spending money for like a year on top of that.\n\nShe is getting consequences, from the post it seems like no one is really looking into what caused this change in her (which might lead to her acting out even more if something is actually wrong). At 14 years her senior I personally feel like you can give a 10yo a little grace by letting her have her birthday money.", "YWBTA she's being punished and you will be getting the money returned to you, don't be spiteful to a kid. You are not her mother, you don't get to make demands about her punishment to soothe your desire for revenge. Keep your make up somewhere she cannot get to it for the time being and stop whining about being 24 and having more responsibility than a 10 year old.", "YWNBTA to ask, but the call is for your parents to make. I hope they see sense, because grounding doesn't seem like it's a significant consequence here.", "It is not your place to decide how to punish your sister, that choice belongs to her parents. And you are NTA here.", "NTA but you have to run it by your parents first. She stole, destroyed the goods, and then lied several times. Okay she's 10, so not that much of a big deal but she still needs to be held accountable.", "YTA, she's 10, she did a bad thing, she is grounded.   Good grief, why  are you even comparing 'i do more chores! i pay rent!'\n\nIt's cruel, she's being punished already, and she's flippin 10 years old, you aren't even her parent, you haven't even lived in the house for a month to start acting like this, her birthday is in 2 months and you want to scheme a way to steal her future money, far after she is already finished punishment.\n\nThis is all just schemey and YTA behavior.", "NTA. She needs to learn that actions have consequences. She took and destroyed items that were not hers. If your parents pay for her mistakes then all she's going to learn is to do stupid things and parents will pay for them. \"Making\" her pay will teach her a valuable lesson.", "NTA.   \nShe is about to learn a very valuable, and expensive, lesson.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nThe 10 year old is stealing make-up and lying about it and instead of talking to her to try and figure what is going on with her, 3 fucking adults just punish her and try and take her money.", "Being grounded for A MONTH is sufficient punishment. A month feels like an eternity for a 10year old. \n\nScheming for her money will make you the asshole.", "Soft YWBTA, but that doesn't mean that your sister shouldn't pay you back at all.\n\n$200 is a lot for a 10 year old - is it likely that she'll get $200 for her birthday, or ever have $200 is she doesn't get spending money apart from her birthday? Your sister probably values her birthday money emotionally more than its monetary value, if that's the only money she gets. I know you want your sister to use hard cash that she owns/gets to pay you back, but is that actually realistic?\n\nHowever, I don't think she should get off scot-free, so talk to your parents about a way that she can pay you back. It might be doing chores, where a nominal monetary value for each chore she does goes to you (from your parents) - are there any chores that you do that she could do? A 10/nearly 11 year old can do chores like taking out trash, loading/emptying the dishwasher, some vacuuming around the house etc. Or, if your sister doesn't get your parents pay for your sister to do things (like go out to the cinema, go to events, any new clothes/toys etc that she doesn't \"need\"), could that be suspended and the money that would have been spent go to you, until she's paid back the $200?\n\nIf you really want to feel like your sister has paid you, and she will get $200 for her birthday, could your parents set chores for her to the value of $200; you get the $200 at her birthday, and she earns the $200 back by doing the chores? She still gets the money eventually, but she has to work for it.", "Soft YTA, but mostly because she's ten, she's already being punished for doing a bad thing, and because two months time is too far away for a ten year old to properly associate the loss of her year's spending money with her theft of make-up.  \n\n\nTake your parents' offer to make you whole, and suggest she gets extra chores like cleaning your shared bathroom.", "NTA but your parents need to pay for it.", "YTA she\u2019s 10! The question should be why she\u2019s lying and stealing. Your parents can pay you back", "YTA for that specific question, yes.\n\nYour parents have offered to pay you back. Accept it. They\u2019re doling out appropriate punishments. And hopefully they\u2019re also thinking about therapy or something else to get to the bottom of WHY she did this.", "Ywbta because that's your parents decision to make, take the money they have offered and suggest she do all the chores you would ordinarily do.\n\nAlso your parents need to determine why she is taking stuff and lying when it's blatantly her that's taken it.", "NTA - One time when I was like 9, I messed around and broke some of my older brothers' models (they were expensive). I was grounded and had to give up all my allowance until it was enough to buy him replacements.I learned to not mess with other people's stuff.", "YTA ,You're 24 moved back into her space and demanding stuff  , clearly she isn't wearing it so therefor doing it to rebel , She a child & been  grounded that's the punishment dealt with. maybe just have a chat with her.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and she needs to learn that. But, maybe a token payment and she does some chores for you. She's only 10 after all.", "YTA yes ofc a 24 year old does more chores than a *ten* year old. What a whiny thing to say. I like your parents suggestion of her working off the debt, and as her parents, that's their call. It would be fair for them to give you the money upfront and then have her to work off paying them back. \n\nAlso the complete lack of regard for whatever your sister is going through to have triggered this behavior is disturbing. This level of sneaking around, lying, and stealing isn't normal 10 year old behavior. It's a scream for help. What your sister needs more than punishment is help. For people to talk to her and *listen* about what she's going through.", "NTA Yes make her pay you back. There are consequences for stealing. She needs to face those consequences. I suggest that in the future you hide your makeup so she can't get to it.", "NTA in the sense that it's valid to be upset. You also need to consider you are 14 years older. 14. You are an adult who can afford expensive make up. She is a child who didn't understand the value. I'm 20, my sister is also 10. If she did this sure I'd be pissed, but I have a job, I can buy more. My sister is a child, I'm an adult. My sister has already done many goofy and frustrating things, I have moved past. Also consider your sister is already being punished for a month straight. That is an eternity to a kid that young. Try and give her some grace, talk to her. Make sure she understands what she did, but be kind. She will remember that when she's older.", "Id make her do like half her birthday money and have your parents recoup the rest.", "NTA\n\n\"Oh but she's like 10\" yeah so? She's ten years old. Old enough to know that stealing is bad and there's consequences to it. She NEEDS to learn the consequences or she'll grow up thinking it's okay to steal. \n\nKids get away with too much shitty behavior and then people are confused why their Teen-forms are so bad. \n\nHowever it's not your place and maybe replacing the whole thing is a bit much", "YTA. let your parents parent your sister and just accept their payment offer. Your sister has behavioral problems that need to be addressed beyond grounding.", "YWBTA. You could suggest to your parents she loses access to the bathroom, and have her side permanently locked. Or that she is the sole person responsible for cleaning it for a month, under your parents\u2019 guidance?", "YWNBTA-Bur\n\nI would settle for HALF her birthday money, AND I would have her hand it to you ON her birthday. \n\nKilling 2 birds with one stone. She will get Something , but she will have to handle her money much more frugally than usual.\n\nThe giving you the money personally increases the feeling of payment.  She gets the full sum from her parents, has the money in her own hands- and then she has to give you half. When you receive the money, say something like \"Thank you. I was very generous this time. Next time you steal anything from me, you will pay back every cent. And if it happens again after that, you will pay back DOUBLE the money you owe. Stealing is not worth it, and I will teach you that\"", "ESH.\n\n\nAt 10 she's old enough to understand right and wrong, understand what belongs to her and what doesn't. It shows bc she lied to you and tried to hide the makeup she took. She knew what she did was wrong.\n\n\nBut she is also a kid and her parents should discipline her. Her house arrest is plenty, but I personally think that it's a good idea for her to pay you back at least partially. Not the whole $200 but at least  like $50 from her allowance and birthday money, but that punishment is still for the parents to decide.\n\n\nCalculate exactly what you lost, how much the palettes and makeup were and let her pay you back some and let the parents pay the difference left.\n\n\nTalk to your sister, ask why she did it, maybe offer to do her makeup for her sometimes or get her a paint set if she wants to use your brushes so badly.", "Absolutely NTA. Yes, she is 10 - but at 10 she knew what she was doing was wrong. Aside from finding out why she's behaving like this, she should have to be the one to pay you back. The point of it being \"a lot of money to a 10 year old\" is moot. She did not just merely use your makeup. She destroyed it. If she doesn't \"get\" the lesson now, when she is older she will deal with much more serious consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So accept the decision made. \n\nYou might be better off taking the money from your parents (they are responsible for damages anyway), plus suggesting she do chores to pay them back.\n\nThink about this. Washing your car, cleaning the bathroom and other age appropriate manual labour tasks will embed consequences for actions whilst instilling a value of how hard it is to earn money.\n\nThe main thing is be understanding that kids often fuck up and there is a reason for it. She has her own thoughts and feelings and means to get attention. She may be trying to communicate something here and you would be better off to work with her, your parents and potentially a professional to decipher what\u2019s going on. \n\nShe might just be feeling insecure or intimidated because she not the only child in the house anymore and has acted out.

Stealing and lying like this is most often a symptom of another issue. It may be something as simple as peer pressure, but it's also commonly associated with trauma, depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. Maybe bullying at school for her appearance (hence stealing the makeup) or something?", "I agree. There is something serious going on. Stealing, lying and destroying things. This definitely wasn't about trying some makeup by herself. No normal healthy and happy kid does this type of stuff.", "My daughter is this age and diagnosed autistic with suspected ADHD. This is typical behaviour for her and not indicative of her being naughty or acting out (the amount of sensory based messes I've cleaned up is phenomenal).\n\nI would also argue it's typical for the age to take things without asking and then not own up because of fear of retribution. Few children are as vindictive and naughty as Reddit makes them out to be. \n\nTake the responsible adult's money, use it to buy lock boxes for your special items, learn that children do not have the same understanding of rules as more mature humans.", "This is the right answer.

The sister naturally have the right to be compensated for her losses.

The chores are only something that benefits them and not you. You suggest your sister pays you back with her birthday money as a lesson in taking responsibility for damaging other people's things.

However, this is on your parents to set this up and enforce it, not you.", "NTA for asking.  your parents seem to be handling it and offered to make it right by giving you the money. I think it\u2019s very telling that your mom ended up going through her stuff. I do think $200 might be too much for the kid, but maybe $100 is attainable? If she got an allowance, maybe your parents could make her give you half of it each time until the $200 is paid off. I agree with you that she is old enough to need to see the consequences and $200 is a lot of money. \n\nIt sounds like maybe she\u2019s been doing it a while since your mom found her own stuff in the stolen/ruined make up. Your sister probably thought she didn\u2019t get caught before, so she won\u2019t get caught now. Kids frequently stick to lies even when obviously caught in said lie. Hopefully she\u2019ll learn, and now you\u2019ve learned that you (sadly) can not trust your sister. Keep your stuff safe and away from her. You shouldn\u2019t have to as a 10 year old should be old enough to be trusted, but she obviously can\u2019t be trusted. Another user said she\u2019s probably doing the stuff on YouTube videos where they mix slime with make up and got caught this time.", "NTA. Even if she's 10, she stole. Its fine to hold her responsible. But run the idea by your parents. If they prefer to just pay you back and still give her a birthday present, you should respect that- it's their kid, not yours.

He broke my arcade machine (one of the joysticks and a couple of buttons) somehow. I found out when I asked him if he wanted a tournament on it (something we do once in a while. He said \u201cNo. I don\u2019t like that game anymore.\u201d Now, we\u2019d been playing it for years together at this point and he loved it. He was usually the one asking me. I turned it on to play, thinking he\u2019d probably join me anyways, and I found that the stick was only inputting one way, and two of the buttons were stuck on. I asked him if he\u2019d played it, and he said \u201cI told you I don\u2019t like that game anymore!\u201d \nWell, I went to charge his phone later that day, and I always check what he\u2019s been up to on it. It\u2019s his phone to use how he wants. I don\u2019t check his internet or anything. He has a YouTube channel, and when he gives me the phone to charge, I edit and upload any videos he\u2019s made. Had a look through and there it was. That same morning he\u2019d recorded himself playing Street Fighter 2. He was hammering the heck out of the buttons, and that\u2019s what did it. He turned off the camera when the machine broke. \n\nI took the phone into his room with me and asked him again if he knew what had happened to our arcade machine. This time I said \u201clook.

I didn\u2019t tell him about the video. Just deleted it off his phone. It cost me just over a hundred dollars to fix the machine. Thing is, I see it as well worth the money to keep a good and trusting relationship with my son. He\u2019s a good kid. Yes, he has his moments where he acts up, just as any kid does.

In future, she needs to be honest if she makes a mistake. That way, it can be fixed. But, if she deliberately hides things, damages stuff or takes things that aren\u2019t hers in future, then you won\u2019t be able to trust her and she\u2019ll have to start paying for her own mistakes.

The child has been punished for her actions, and you were even attempted to be reimbursed for what you lost. You continuing to reiterate \"but she stole 200$\" is kinda pointless when said 200$ were offered back to you.\n\nAnything past this point is a vendetta/revenge imo. Your mother seems to have the right idea, let her handle it as she's the one responsible for her child.", "She is 11, so I would just take the money from your mom and dad, all they are going to do is give her less or nothing at all for her birthday.  Lesson learned.", "Yeh OP really doesn't need to get involved at this point. The parents are handling it - younger sister is suffering appropriate consequences, and the parents have offered to cover the costs. End of at this point.", "I agree! It's up to OP's parents to decide the punishment. OP just take the money from your parents and let them punish her as they see fit.", "Yes, absolutely this. Parents can pay for the make up and the kid will pay them back by doing chores.   \n\n\nThat's what I've done with my kids and everyone has felt that this has been a fair way to solve things.", "I'm also wondering if she's really going to get even close to that much in birthday money. I know it's not impossible, (and that my experiences are not universal) but it does strike me as far fetched.\n\nOne option tho, is if your parents pay you back now so you've got what you need to replace stuff right away, and if she pays them back over time. It might also help to keep her doing it steadily, and to keep things from getting too heated if she slacks on it.\n\nI figure this way you don't have to worry about policing her on it, she learns her lesson, and you don't have to worry about waiting a long time to replace your things.\n\nAlso, I'd advise some kind of locking container to store these things in afterward. And also possibly storing them in your room rather than the bathroom, just in case.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think you'd be in the wrong for wanting your sister to pay you back. She absolutely should so the lesson is learned properly. I just don't think it should be something decided only by you. Take some time to discuss with your parents and see if something can be worked out.", "This is very trick because she is blatantly lying to her whole family, and if her parents pay for hers, she might not understand real consequences. It's not like she is 5, she is closer to 11 than she is to 10, and she knows that she did something wrong and keeps lying. \n\nI feel like first and foremost her parents should be trying to understand why her sister is lying and stealing because this is the real problem here and if she gets out without real consequences and don't really understand why this is wrong, she gonna do it again. Maybe to stores, maybe to her friend's family.", "I think she does have a say since it was also her stuff that was stolen/destroyed.  actions have consequences so there should be some for lying, for stealing, and for destroying the carpet.   I'd say a portion of her bday money should go to replacement and work off the rest (including perhaps doing some of OP's chores)\n\nBut I think there's a bigger issue as to why she steals and lies that needs to be addressed perhaps with some counseling", "Agreed. Take the money and let your parents handle this. If they use the birthday money then that is fine.

Her parents are.\n\nSoooo NTA to want money but also not your place to decide where that money comes from. Don\u2019t be petty because she is your sister. If it were aaaany other child it probably wouldn\u2019t matter where the money came from as long as you could buy new make up right? So why would your sister be different? She is 10 so her parents are responsible.", "She\u2019s 10. I work with 10 year olds\u2014this kind of behavior is not that surprising at this age. Kids are naturally forming stronger identity and independence as they hit puberty and it\u2019s a rocky process a lot of the time. Kids push boundaries. Kids start thinking they know better than the adults around them. Kids keep secrets. Kids become very susceptible to social and societal pressure.\n\nIf I had to guess, events went like this:\n\nGirl feels social/societal pressure to use makeup because of girls and women around her wearing makeup.\n\nGirl knows that parents will not buy her hundreds of dollars worth of makeup, but her mom and big sister have makeup.\n\nGirl takes a few things that are easily missed to try them out. It\u2019s messy and she\u2019s worried mom and sister will be upset if she returns them like that, plus she wants to use them more, so she keeps them. She doesn\u2019t know how to care for makeup, so it ends up in terrible condition.\n\nNo one notices the makeup is missing, so she figures it\u2019s a victimless crime. She takes more and continues to get away with it until one day sister notices something\u2019s missing. She knows she\u2019ll be in trouble if she confesses, so she lies. Still, she feels bad so she tries to return the thing that was missed. Maybe sister will just think she misplaced it?\n\nSister gets fully busted.

Kids lie because they know they've done something wrong and don't want to be punished. Exploring makeup is pretty standard at the sister's age and if she doesn't get any spending money then she doesn't have a way to get her own, and she probably felt it wouldn't be a big deal to 'borrow' it and didn't want to run the risk of asking and being told no.", "I'd assume she's curious about make up but isn't allowed to experiment with it.", "Well she keeps mentioning \"slime\" all over the place.

I can definitely understand Op being upset about her things being stolen and ruined and lied about, but the vibe she\u2019s giving off in her post seems \u2026 off somehow.

Either way, OP needs to let the parents decide the punishment and work with their kid to ensure she doesn't do it again. \n\nThe reality is, there will probably be more hiccups down the line since this is seemingly a very new dynamic for this kid. If OP tries to suddenly go against the parents word or dish out their own punishments, this kid will probably rebel even more since she probably sees OP as someone who invaded her space opposed to an authority figure.", "I 100% agree, the only thing I would add is that I'd simply wouldn't buy anything for her upcoming birthday as she doesn't deserve it.", "Hold up. \n\nI get that OP doesn\u2019t decide how the kid is punished.

I agree that it's the parents job to parent but the sisters behaviour is just pinging warning flags in me.\n\nThe fact that the kid lied for a long time, was caught with evidence and still denies it and is not remorseful even with a punishment. That behaviour kind of makes me question the kids moral compass a bit, and maybe even the parenting.\n\nAt 10 you know when you doing something \"bad\", and when you are caught out.  As a generalisation, I feel like this unremorseful behaviour often happens when kids know their parents punishment have no real weight. E.g they know the parents give up 1 week into a punishment, or giving the kid the device back is easier than following through with a punishment. I'm not saying this is the case here, and i'm not a professional so there might be other issues going on here but it kind of fits the stereotype.  \n\nEven if I'm completeley wrong, there is something going on below the surface and i hope OP's parents realise it and try to figure it out, rather than just paying OP off and trying to sweep the prooblem under the rug.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that being said I still think it's not OP's place to parent.

She's probably seeing her friends with more stuff/spending money (her only spending money for the year is bday money), and her sister/parents having these nice things she cant get but her friends can. Obviously she understands the basic concept that stealing is wrong, but is probably too young to understand income or wealth disparity, and thinks it's unfair for her to go without when everyone else gets nice things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably a good time to start teaching her the value of work, task her with chores and pay her a small amount, or find something you normally pay an outside person to do and get her to do it.

She is 10 going on 11, people on here think kids are fully developed at this point.  It honestly cracks me up, she 10, she going to lie, especially when being confronted.  Because why???  Because she is a kid!!!  They make mistakes, they don't hold themselves accountable, and it the job of the parents to correct them when they make mistakes.  Unfortunately, this time around it was an expensive mistake.", ">all this kid needs is a lesson in why this is wrong\n\n100%. OP just take the money from your parents, you're being extra.

I've worked with kids that age and they don't do things for no reason. But it doesn't help to shout at them or demand absurd things. You should ask why they act like they do. Just  grounding them don't do any good. You have to listen. Why did you steal them? Is because you wanted to try them? Why did you destroy them? You have to let them tell you. If something is wrong and they do it because they don't feel well, you try to help them.

Kids get their money from their parents anyway, and they are fairly offering to compensate OP for the damages. Children do chores to earn money right? So in a way, the chores she does will pay the parents back for the money *they* spent to replace the damages.\n\nEdit; realised I replied to the wrong comment now... but I do think OP getting a lock for her makeup drawer is a good idea!", "You're right, with the allowance, it took much, much longer to pay off than birthday money.

Honestly I feel like this is going to be a wash for you. The makeup is gone - it is what it is. You need to take the loss. Your sister messed up and is facing consequences for her actions by your parents. If you do feel like you need more than an apology, maybe take a 1/3rd of however much money you were planning to give her but not taking away all her birthday money. I think having a conversation with her, explaining why you're doing this, as well as finding out what may be going on in her mind to do something like what she did in the first place, will do more for your relationship than what your initial plan was.", "YWBTA - this is one of two things. Sister either has some mental health/behavioral issues that need addressed. OR she just wanted to experiment with makeup so she took yours not realizing it\u2019s something that costs real money. \n\nTake your parents money. Get her some cheap kids makeup and let her experiment. You can even teach her how to use it and it will be fun. My daughter watches tutorials on YouTube and it\u2019s adorable.

Did she use the makeup to make slime??\n\nI do think YTA for wanting your sister to pay you back when your parents have already offered.

Yet you throw away the offer of her doing chores to earn money to pay you back.  At 10 she can do most household chores.

If you want the money back, get it from the parents. I think this is ironically a good bonding opportunity for you and your sister. She's clearly interested in learning to apply makeup, so you could use this opportunity to teach her what you know, do it together, and bond over it. If you strengthen your bond she's probably less likely to do this in the future and you are also showing her that, although there are consequences to her actions it's okay to mess up.", "YTA, yes. She's still young enough that a more suitable consequence is whatever your parents decide, and it sounds like they are on top of it now.

Taking all her birthday money would be excessive.", "She is 10 and made a mistake. It is her parents' responsibility to decide how to punish her.", "YWBTA yeah. If your parents have offered to pay you back then you take that offer. There's absolutely no use turning it down and trying to get your 10 year old sister to pay up that money herself. \n\nPlus, there isn't a 10 year old on the planet that's going to be able to afford 200$, so it's just going to lead to further aggravation for all of you. \n\nLet your parents handle this, take the money they've offered you, and try to move past it.", "YTA She\u2019s 10, for Christ\u2019s sake, what\u2019s your excuse?

They're still growing and learning, and they can't  oversee the consequences of their actions.\n\nThat means the parents are liable. also means that it's up to the parents to decide how you should be reimbursed. \n\nIf the parents decide to take (part of) the birthday money, that's up to them. You can't demand that they do so. \n\nThe main thing is that you should be reimbursed.

She should have consequences but what those are is up to her parents and they seem to be dealing with it. \n\nAs a side issue - a 10 year old should have access to her own spending money. I foster and my kids get $1 per year of life per week, ie a 10 yo gets $10 a week. Parents are responsible for 'needs' - clothing, shoes, toiletries, and the child pays for their own 'wants', outside of Christmas and birthdays. It teaches them budgeting and gives them some control over access to things they want, like make up. \n\nAlso, maybe be a great big sister and buy her age appropriate make up for her birthday.", "YTA.

There are better ways.\n\n>what chores is she going to do for me to pay me back? I do more chores than her and I pay rent!\n\nWell for a start she could do all the chores that you currently do. \n\nThe sensible thing here is for you to accept the repayment from your parents. It is their job to raise her well and therefore their failure that she robbed you and your mother, and lied about it. It is also their job as her parents to determine the next steps, ie punishment and/or restitution.\n\nHer punishment is the full grounding for a month. As for restitution, she should take over all your chores  for which you could be \u2018paying\u2019 her a nominal fee of say $10 a week which, instead of being an actual payment, would be deducted from her debt.\n\nAfter 20 weeks of doing all your chores, her debt is paid and either you get those chores back or, if everybody agrees, you start paying her the actual $10 to do them for you. This way she can start earning a little money year round rather than having to eke out her birthday money over 12 months. She can then use it to buy her own makeup rather than stealing yours, and she might start to have a sense of the value of things.", "YWBTA.\n\nThe lying more than anything is what is messed up.

This is a 24-year-old who is angry with a 10-year-old, and wants to demand their birthday money. \n\nHer post sounds vindictive towards this child, who seemingly has a larger issue at hand. Sometimes punishment is the correct decision, and it will help the situation and prevent it from happening again. Perhaps they should do this, but to rant about it on Reddit with an angry tone (near the end of the post) sounds a bit vindictive. If this was something she wanted, she should discuss it with her parents. But this post makes it sound more like she wants revenge for her destroyed makeup. \n\nOP keeps mentioning this slime, clearly agitated, and perhaps a subconscious attempt to paint the child in a bad light. So while it might seem like I\u2019m being a jerk to OP, I think OP is painting a narrative on why the younger sibling deserves to be punished. She is angry, and that\u2019s okay, I get it. I would be too. She is just not doing this punishment out of a desire to teach her sister a lesson, it sounds to me that she\u2019s doing it for vengeance. To get back at her. It\u2019s her birthday, after all. \n\nMy problem is this: \n\nThe child is seemingly a (extreme, so maybe an unfitting word) kleptomaniac, but why? I think this is the bigger issue. Perhaps punishment is important, but if her reasons for stealing are coming from feelings of neglect or some other related issue, will punishment help? Maybe. Possibly. I certainly think a discussion should be had on why it\u2019s wrong. But I also think maybe some sort of therapy would be good too. She clearly has an issue of jealousy or simply desires to be more like her sibling/mother, maybe she doesn\u2019t get enough attention. I don\u2019t know. Perhaps she is in a perfectly healthy household and this behavior is unexpected, all the more reason to seek therapy. \n\nWith that being said, she may be spoiled and not usually punished. If that\u2019s the case, then it is the parents fault that this has happened. \n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t take her birthday money from her personally, but I couldn\u2019t blame them if they did.
