My little sister (10) and I share a jack and Jill bathroom, I had been noticing slime and spilled wax all over the counter tops and and light switch in my side of the bathroom and had talked to my parents about keeping my little sister out of my side of the bathroom. \n\nWell 2 weeks ago I was supposed to go on a date but couldn\u2019t find any of my makeup, I asked my little sister if she had taken it out of my bathroom and her response was \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you wore makeup\u201d. She\u2019s a good kid so I believed her and figured I must have lost my makeup in the move which pissed me off because I buy expensive stuff since I don\u2019t use it too often. I ended up going to the store that day and just replacing the concealer/foundation (100$) since I couldn\u2019t afford to replace my whole set. \n\nWell this morning I wake up to find my old concealer/foundation sitting right on top of the new ones I just bought. I asked my mom if she had found it somewhere and she said she never touched it. It was pretty obvious that it had leaked or something because there was makeup all on the outside of the bottle and it was way more empty than when I last had it. My mom immediately thinks that my little sister took it and goes into her room to snoop around. \n\nThe next think I know my mom starts tossing the room and I\u2019m trying to get her to stop when she finally dumps out a drawer with not only my makeup but a bunch of makeup of my moms that had gone missing. My sister had taken 2 makeup pallets of mine, 1 I hadn\u2019t even opened yet, brushes, lipstick, eye liner, basically everything. On top of that my mom found open containers of slime and paint that had seeped into the carpet and other shit she had stolen from around the house.\n\nAll of the makeup she took from my mom and I were destroyed, the pallets were mixed together and cracked, brushes had paint in them, lipstick mashed, and everything was covered in slime. When me and my parents confronted her she denied everything, even said that she didn\u2019t use any of the makeup when it was an obvious lie. \n\nMy parents have grounded her for month (no phone, no electronics) and have offered to pay me back but I don\u2019t want them to pay me back I want HER to pay me back. She stole and destroyed nearly 200$ in makeup and lied to my face about it, the worst part is I\u2019ve only been living here for 3 weeks! Her 11th birthday is coming up in 2 months and I\u2019m wondering if i would be the asshole if I made her use her birthday money to pay me back? I feel like taking her birthday money is cruel especially because it\u2019s the only kind of spending money she gets all year and my parents have suggested chores but what chores is she gonna do for me to pay me back? I do more chores than her and I pay rent!\n\nTLDR: 10yr old sister stole and destroyed 200$ worth of makeup from me, WIBTA if I made her pay me back with her birthday money?", "created_utc": 1681373689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kh3zc/wibta_i_i_made_my_10yr_old_sister_use_her/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her and your parents are legally responsible for damages caused by their child. Hence the money is truly Thier responsibility. How to raise your sister is also their job. If they chose to use her bday money to pay you back then fine. It could probably be seen as proper consequences for her actions. But it's not really your place to decide this.", "The real question is, what is going on with your little sister that she is stealing and lying?  She's obviously acting out for some reason.", "The decision of how to punish your sister is belongs entirely to your parents, not to you.  You can make suggestions, but that's it.  Your mother has offered to replace your make-up, so you will be made whole.  The fact that you want to be made whole by a 10 year old, with very limited access to money, or the ability to earn money, is probably not realistic.\n\nAgain, it is not for you to make your sister fork over her birthday money.  You are the sister, not the parent.", "YTA. Parents are responsible for their underage children's actions, and they've offered to make you whole by paying for the makeup. Anything else is between them and your sister", "YWBTA, yeah...\n\nYou get that $200 to her is like the equivalent of $2,000 or $20,000 to you, right? I mean, she has no income; is she going to get $200 on her birthday?\n\nBut regardless and more importantly, its not your job to parent or punish your sister, and sounds like your parents are on top of it... if they're willing to pay you back, then you should back off...", "YTA - let your parents pay you back and deal with her punishment. She's 10. Kids do dumb shit. She'll be doing chores to pay your parents back for paying you back.", "if you make her pay for it then in my opinion you\u2019re TA , yes her stealing and lying and destroying your stuff is awful but remember she\u2019s 10 years old and her parents are the ones responsible for her so if they pay you back then they pay you back.", "YTA if you do, yes.\n\nShe is 10. You describe her as a good kid you would believe, and you take her word for it when she says she didnt do it at first. She is now stealing and breaking things, then lying even tho she knows you all know. Are none of the adults in the house a bit worried about why she is acting out in this way and what might have changed?\n\nYour anger and frustration is entirely understandable. You splurge on quaity items that goes missing, she lies and destroys it. That isnt ok at all. Your items are being replaced, she is getting consequences (no electronics for a month for a 10yo in this day and age might honestly impact her ability to socialize both in and out of school in a quite significant way), I just dont see why it will help you by going over your parents heads and take away her spending money for like a year on top of that.\n\nShe is getting consequences, from the post it seems like no one is really looking into what caused this change in her (which might lead to her acting out even more if something is actually wrong). At 14 years her senior I personally feel like you can give a 10yo a little grace by letting her have her birthday money.", "YWBTA she's being punished and you will be getting the money returned to you, don't be spiteful to a kid. You are not her mother, you don't get to make demands about her punishment to soothe your desire for revenge. Keep your make up somewhere she cannot get to it for the time being and stop whining about being 24 and having more responsibility than a 10 year old.", "YWNBTA to ask, but the call is for your parents to make. I hope they see sense, because grounding doesn't seem like it's a significant consequence here.", "It is not your place to decide how to punish your sister, that choice belongs to her parents. And you are NTA here.", "NTA but you have to run it by your parents first. She stole, destroyed the goods, and then lied several times. Okay she's 10, so not that much of a big deal but she still needs to be held accountable.", "YTA, she's 10, she did a bad thing, she is grounded.   Good grief, why  are you even comparing 'i do more chores! i pay rent!'\n\nIt's cruel, she's being punished already, and she's flippin 10 years old, you aren't even her parent, you haven't even lived in the house for a month to start acting like this, her birthday is in 2 months and you want to scheme a way to steal her future money, far after she is already finished punishment.\n\nThis is all just schemey and YTA behavior.", "NTA. She needs to learn that actions have consequences. She took and destroyed items that were not hers. If your parents pay for her mistakes then all she's going to learn is to do stupid things and parents will pay for them. \"Making\" her pay will teach her a valuable lesson.", "NTA.   \nShe is about to learn a very valuable, and expensive, lesson.", "Ywnbta to ask your parents about how you can deal with his at her bday.", "ESH.\n\nThe 10 year old is stealing make-up and lying about it and instead of talking to her to try and figure what is going on with her, 3 fucking adults just punish her and try and take her money.", "Being grounded for A MONTH is sufficient punishment. A month feels like an eternity for a 10year old. \n\nScheming for her money will make you the asshole.", "Soft YWBTA, but that doesn't mean that your sister shouldn't pay you back at all.\n\n$200 is a lot for a 10 year old - is it likely that she'll get $200 for her birthday, or ever have $200 is she doesn't get spending money apart from her birthday? Your sister probably values her birthday money emotionally more than its monetary value, if that's the only money she gets. I know you want your sister to use hard cash that she owns/gets to pay you back, but is that actually realistic?\n\nHowever, I don't think she should get off scot-free, so talk to your parents about a way that she can pay you back. It might be doing chores, where a nominal monetary value for each chore she does goes to you (from your parents) - are there any chores that you do that she could do? A 10/nearly 11 year old can do chores like taking out trash, loading/emptying the dishwasher, some vacuuming around the house etc. Or, if your sister doesn't get your parents pay for your sister to do things (like go out to the cinema, go to events, any new clothes/toys etc that she doesn't \"need\"), could that be suspended and the money that would have been spent go to you, until she's paid back the $200?\n\nIf you really want to feel like your sister has paid you, and she will get $200 for her birthday, could your parents set chores for her to the value of $200; you get the $200 at her birthday, and she earns the $200 back by doing the chores? She still gets the money eventually, but she has to work for it.", "Soft YTA, but mostly because she's ten, she's already being punished for doing a bad thing, and because two months time is too far away for a ten year old to properly associate the loss of her year's spending money with her theft of make-up.  \n\n\nTake your parents' offer to make you whole, and suggest she gets extra chores like cleaning your shared bathroom.", "NTA but your parents need to pay for it.", "YTA she\u2019s 10! The question should be why she\u2019s lying and stealing. Your parents can pay you back", "YTA for that specific question, yes.\n\nYour parents have offered to pay you back. Accept it. They\u2019re doling out appropriate punishments. And hopefully they\u2019re also thinking about therapy or something else to get to the bottom of WHY she did this.", "Ywbta because that's your parents decision to make, take the money they have offered and suggest she do all the chores you would ordinarily do.\n\nAlso your parents need to determine why she is taking stuff and lying when it's blatantly her that's taken it.", "NTA - One time when I was like 9, I messed around and broke some of my older brothers' models (they were expensive). I was grounded and had to give up all my allowance until it was enough to buy him replacements.I learned to not mess with other people's stuff.", "YTA ,You're 24 moved back into her space and demanding stuff  , clearly she isn't wearing it so therefor doing it to rebel , She a child & been  grounded that's the punishment dealt with. maybe just have a chat with her.", "NTA. Actions have consequences and she needs to learn that. But, maybe a token payment and she does some chores for you. She's only 10 after all.", "YTA yes ofc a 24 year old does more chores than a *ten* year old. What a whiny thing to say. I like your parents suggestion of her working off the debt, and as her parents, that's their call. It would be fair for them to give you the money upfront and then have her to work off paying them back. \n\nAlso the complete lack of regard for whatever your sister is going through to have triggered this behavior is disturbing. This level of sneaking around, lying, and stealing isn't normal 10 year old behavior. It's a scream for help. What your sister needs more than punishment is help. For people to talk to her and *listen* about what she's going through.", "NTA Yes make her pay you back. There are consequences for stealing. She needs to face those consequences. I suggest that in the future you hide your makeup so she can't get to it.", "NTA in the sense that it's valid to be upset. You also need to consider you are 14 years older. 14. You are an adult who can afford expensive make up. She is a child who didn't understand the value. I'm 20, my sister is also 10. If she did this sure I'd be pissed, but I have a job, I can buy more. My sister is a child, I'm an adult. My sister has already done many goofy and frustrating things, I have moved past. Also consider your sister is already being punished for a month straight. That is an eternity to a kid that young. Try and give her some grace, talk to her. Make sure she understands what she did, but be kind. She will remember that when she's older.", "Id make her do like half her birthday money and have your parents recoup the rest.", "NTA\n\n\"Oh but she's like 10\" yeah so? She's ten years old. Old enough to know that stealing is bad and there's consequences to it. She NEEDS to learn the consequences or she'll grow up thinking it's okay to steal. \n\nKids get away with too much shitty behavior and then people are confused why their Teen-forms are so bad. \n\nHowever it's not your place and maybe replacing the whole thing is a bit much", "YTA. let your parents parent your sister and just accept their payment offer. Your sister has behavioral problems that need to be addressed beyond grounding.", "YWBTA. You could suggest to your parents she loses access to the bathroom, and have her side permanently locked. Or that she is the sole person responsible for cleaning it for a month, under your parents\u2019 guidance?", "YWNBTA-Bur\n\nI would settle for HALF her birthday money, AND I would have her hand it to you ON her birthday. \n\nKilling 2 birds with one stone. She will get Something , but she will have to handle her money much more frugally than usual.\n\nThe giving you the money personally increases the feeling of payment.  She gets the full sum from her parents, has the money in her own hands- and then she has to give you half. When you receive the money, say something like \"Thank you. I was very generous this time. Next time you steal anything from me, you will pay back every cent. And if it happens again after that, you will pay back DOUBLE the money you owe. Stealing is not worth it, and I will teach you that\"", "ESH.\n\n\nAt 10 she's old enough to understand right and wrong, understand what belongs to her and what doesn't. It shows bc she lied to you and tried to hide the makeup she took. She knew what she did was wrong.\n\n\nBut she is also a kid and her parents should discipline her. Her house arrest is plenty, but I personally think that it's a good idea for her to pay you back at least partially. Not the whole $200 but at least  like $50 from her allowance and birthday money, but that punishment is still for the parents to decide.\n\n\nCalculate exactly what you lost, how much the palettes and makeup were and let her pay you back some and let the parents pay the difference left.\n\n\nTalk to your sister, ask why she did it, maybe offer to do her makeup for her sometimes or get her a paint set if she wants to use your brushes so badly.", "Absolutely NTA. Yes, she is 10 - but at 10 she knew what she was doing was wrong. Aside from finding out why she's behaving like this, she should have to be the one to pay you back. The point of it being \"a lot of money to a 10 year old\" is moot. She did not just merely use your makeup. She destroyed it. If she doesn't \"get\" the lesson now, when she is older she will deal with much more serious consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s their call at the end of the day I\u2019m afraid.\n\nBut think about this. Washing your car, cleaning the bathroom and other age appropriate manual labour tasks will embed consequences for actions whilst instilling a value of how hard it is to earn money. \n\nThe main thing is be understanding that kids often fuck up and there is a reason for it.

Y\u2019all get a grip.", "One good thing is, these parents are offering to pay the OP back instead of making excuses.", "Seriously, this child needs support and help - probably therapy to get to the bottom of this. Stealing and lying like this is most often a symptom of another issue. It may be something as simple as peer pressure, but it's also commonly associated with trauma, depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. Maybe bullying at school for her appearance (hence stealing the makeup) or something?", "I agree. There is something serious going on. Stealing, lying and destroying things. This definitely wasn't about trying some makeup by herself. No normal healthy and happy kid does this type of stuff.", "My daughter is this age and diagnosed autistic with suspected ADHD. This is typical behaviour for her and not indicative of her being naughty or acting out (the amount of sensory based messes I've cleaned up is phenomenal).\n\nI would also argue it's typical for the age to take things without asking and then not own up because of fear of retribution. Few children are as vindictive and naughty as Reddit makes them out to be. \n\nTake the responsible adult's money, use it to buy lock boxes for your special items, learn that children do not have the same understanding of rules as more mature humans.", "This is the right answer. Parents are liable for damage done by their children. What consequences the child experiences for her actions, is entirely up to the parents, and nothing to do with you.

Nor is it yours.", "OP is valid in being upset, but definitely needs to understand she is 14 years older than that child. 14!", "Being grounded doesn't address what your sister did wrong. She intentionally destroyed things and then lied about it. To show her the magnitude of what she did (and more importantly to prevent her from destroying other people's things in the future), she should have to pay to replace your makeup. That is the punishment that fits the crime.", "Yep, I agree. YWBTA\n\nYou\u2019re not the parent. Her parents are giving a suitable punishment and they\u2019re reimbursing you. \n\n$200 is a lot of money for a child. \n\nShe\u2019s acting up. But I should imagine you suddenly moving back in and the way you treat her has a lot to do with it.", "Yeah, they seem to be handling the issue in a sensible manner. Whatever punishment the parents decide upon it's hopefully going to be one that teaches the kid that this is unacceptable behaviour. The sister naturally have the right to be compensated for her losses. If it's necessary for it to be taken out of the kids bday gifts is entirely up to the parents.", "I totally agree it's valid to be upset.  The real clinch that the OP is TA is that she is already scheming... months ahead of time, to take away birthday money.  That's purely YTA type of behavior.", "Are you replying to me?
