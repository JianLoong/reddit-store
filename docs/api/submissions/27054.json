He's mentally handicapped (I don't really know what it is) and practically acts like a 7-year-old (which is a little annoying but I don't blame him or anything.)\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning it was really hot and everyone was down stairs so I walked into the spare room to find a dress, only to find practically every single one with cuts and parts on the floor.\n\nI basically freaked out and instantly knew who it was since my aunt and mom wouldn't do something like that. \n\nI stormed down the stairs and screamed at him, which attracted my aunt and mom to come immediately. I couldn't be calmed down at all, since I bought most of the dresses with my own money.\n\nHe started crying and my aunt hugged him, trying to console him whilst my mom started yelling at me for making him cry. He even admitted to it after a while and even then they consoled him!\n\nMy mom offered to pay for some but it's only enough to for like ten dresses and I had over thirty, besides I can't find some of my favorites since we're getting closer to winter and the fact that I was proud that I paid for it myself.\n\nSome of my family (including my mom & aunt) are all telling me I'm in the wrong and to apologize to him, but I really don't think I'm wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome context: I am a 16-year-old cis woman and haven't seen my aunt and cousin for a little over two years.

I know many 7-year-olds and not a single one of them would do a thing like that.

With his disability, he needs more consistency and clear guidelines on how to behave. Once he was calmed down, she should have guided him to apologize for his actions and offered to make amends. How else will he learn how to behave in the world? It's not fair to you for your destroyed dresses, but it is also not fair to him because it is stifling his growth. He deserves to be taught how to respect others' property and how to apologize for his mistakes, even if he needs more guidance to learn those lessons.", "NTA, he needs to be taught he can\u2019t do whatever he wants, being handicapped does not mean he can\u2019t be disciplined.

All 3 of my policies do, so it\u2019s not unheard of. \n\nA police report may need to be made - obviously the cousin would be below age of responsibility- but Aunt should check her policies as to what is required. That would be the best way for her not to be totally out of pocket for her mistake of leaving the boy unattended. Equally, the parents\u2019 home insurance / contents insurance would likely cover and aunt can pay the deductible and increase in insurance costs. \n\nIn mean time , OP, catalogue your losses with pictures of damage , the actual items boxed away, and look for prices or proof of purchase to show monetary damages.", "I cant wait to hear how a 16 year old will retain an attorney", "Yeah and then OP is going to lose at least a mother and an aunt.

From the child's perspective, they were brought all the way from their home country, specifically to another person's just for something that isn't about them. They might feel a percieved slip of control, or attention, or affection due to this. If that perception is focused on you, they might take it out on you. I don't know the kid's medical history, so i'm not gonna speculate. There's a litany of disorders in children that can explain this, or... good ol' fashioned jealousy. Kids are not always rational thinkers, and jealousy clouds even the most rational of us. No need for any disorder, kids act more on impulse than anything else. Course, it could be something, or just jealousy and a kid who doesn't understand impact of their decisions. doesn't make it okay, you still treat him like a kid who fucked up, cuz they did.

Europeans travel internationally comparatively more than Americans, so again , it\u2019s believable they\u2019d have travel insurance that covers medical and bags and emergencies when far from home, especially with a special needs child. If they have it , they probably don\u2019t realize it\u2019ll cover personal liability. I\u2019d bet a majority of people haven\u2019t closely read their policies until they need to make a claim. \n\nBut maybe that\u2019s my wishful thinking , hoping there\u2019s a way that OP is made whole and that her family will agree to it because it doesn\u2019t cost them much.", "Me too.

It\u2019s no more acceptable for her to scream at her cousin, than it would be for her cousin to scream at her, or cut up her clothing or anything else. She should at least be taught that screaming at anyone doesn\u2019t fix the situation. If she feels enraged, there are other ways to deal with it without hurling abuse at someone else. I know she\u2019s young, and this was a mistake, but this is a learning moment for her. Learn to control her anger and use it constructively.

Yes 16 is old enough to know *what* to do but not quite old enough to get yourself to do the right thing. Your impulses still reign higher than your logic and reason at that age. If someone destroyed something that I spend a lot of time and money and effort to acquire as a teenager I doubt I would have been able to not yell. In hindsight I would learn but your brain is no where near done developing at 16.
