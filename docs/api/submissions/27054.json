I couldn't be calmed down at all, since I bought most of the dresses with my own money.\n\nHe started crying and my aunt hugged him, trying to console him whilst my mom started yelling at me for making him cry. He even admitted to it after a while and even then they consoled him!\n\nMy mom offered to pay for some but it's only enough to for like ten dresses and I had over thirty, besides I can't find some of my favorites since we're getting closer to winter and the fact that I was proud that I paid for it myself.\n\nSome of my family (including my mom & aunt) are all telling me I'm in the wrong and to apologize to him, but I really don't think I'm wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome context: I am a 16-year-old cis woman and haven't seen my aunt and cousin for a little over two years.

I know many 7-year-olds and not a single one of them would do a thing like that.

With his disability, he needs more consistency and clear guidelines on how to behave. Once he was calmed down, she should have guided him to apologize for his actions and offered to make amends. How else will he learn how to behave in the world? It's not fair to you for your destroyed dresses, but it is also not fair to him because it is stifling his growth. He deserves to be taught how to respect others' property and how to apologize for his mistakes, even if he needs more guidance to learn those lessons.", "NTA, he needs to be taught he can\u2019t do whatever he wants, being handicapped does not mean he can\u2019t be disciplined.

The question was \"Am I the Asshole for yelling at my mentally handicapped cousin for cutting up all my dresses?\" In my opinion, yes. It doesn't help the situation, and it seems to have hindered a solution. A different approach could have resulted in replacement/ payment, and the aunt's accountability as well as accountability for the cousin much faster without having to ask AITA. I'm suggesting going at it in a different way. It's teachable for the aunt and the cousin. The only thing I felt OP could learn, is yelling at someone doesn't always end in the results she hoped for. Perhaps, a more gentle approach could help all involved. Not her job, but she has an opportunity to teach everyone.

Yes, she is. She is totally justified in being VERY angry, and I'm not saying it's the worst most evil thing, but I think it more than warrants an apology. It doesn't sound like her cousin is able to really understand that what he did is wrong. I think it's very rare that anyone deserves to be yelled at. Kids who make a mess/destroy something accidentally or without knowing it's bad don't deserve to be yelled at (as common as it is). Discipline, explaining why it was wrong, consequences... yes.

Your destroyed wardrobe is proof that that didn\u2019t happen.

Additionally, if a family member destroys my child\u2019s property & doesn\u2019t replace it, I will do it myself instead of just leaving my child to swing in the wind as my family did. Yet your own mother only offered to pay for less than 1/3 of the entire wardrobe he destroyed.

Even if you had, OP doesn't know enough about the cousin's situation for anyone to know absolutely what is going on in the cousin's mind.  Who knows how cousin responds to being yelled at.  Do they comprehend what they did wrong?  He admit that he cut the dresses up but that doesn't mean he knows what about that action is wrong.  And before you say that the aunt should teach him, plenty of mentally handicapped individuals CAN'T learn these things.  That's why ABA therapy is so popular for autistic kids.  Instead of trying to teach them WHY their negative behavior is problematic, you just focus on directing them to exhibit positive behaviors and you move on. \n\nIMO OP should apologize to the cousin because they are incapable of understanding why they're getting yelled at.

Any of us would have been pissed had this happened to us, and that's valid.", ">Is there though?\n\nof course there is. There is no such thing as a learning disability that literally makes someone have the exact same cognitive abilities, social skills and development as a child x years old. Learning disabilities can come with an entire spectrum of problems with cognition, social skills, sensory issues, and associated conditions involving mental health and things like ADHD, oppositional defiance disorder etc.\n\nOP totally has a right to be mad but saying \"my seven year old wouldn't do this\" as if that has any bearing on the situation is dumb.", "She said he admitted to doing it so verbal", "Yes, there is. \n\nA 7 year old will have the cognitive abilities expected of a 7 year old, maybe slightly behind or slightly ahead in some areas, but generally, what you expect from a 7 year old.\n\nWhile someone acting like they are 7 but are really older, may have the maturity of a 7 year old socially while having other abilities at widely varying levels because they aren't ACTUALLY 7.\n\nFor instance, they may still be at the right reading level for their age. But they may not understand the concept of money, more like a 2 year old. Some stuff can be significantly further behind while other stuff may not be as delayed. So acting like they are a neurotypical 7 year old, oversimplifies things so they won't get help with where they are behind, while also undermining what they can do at an expected level and that they can still grow and learn.\n\nSo we have no idea if this kid has an understanding of the specific concepts involved in this (ownership of possessions, cost, money). He could easily be very behind in all of these concepts or he could know at a normal level for his age but that his mum will not punish him so he just does stuff anyway like a demonic 7 year old rather than the 13 year old he is.", "for many mental handicaps, yes, poor reasoning and/or impulse control is present. We would need to know more about his disability before ascribing blame. The blame falls on his mother due to poor supervision. Your example of an exemplary 16yo non verbal autistic child cannot be (and isnt) the standard for all with mental disabilities. It also assumes some malice (no basic manners), but how do we know he just wasnt cutting shapes in his mind, no 'bad manners' intended, so none breached? We are assuming too much, similar to the other commenter suggesting more innocence on the child's end. There is a wide spectrum of mental disability, although impulse control is usually much much more prevalent in many types of mental handicaps (so its more likely), we still cant assume. \n\nBasically, if we wanted to have this discussion, more info is needed. In the end, the blame falls on the adult as he was their responsibility.", "I agree, cognitive disability can mean such a great variety of things. People with cognitive disabilities who generally need low support can have problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut from what I know about OPs situation I think the lack of supervision for the teenager with disabilities was the problem.", "No, but being upset over something being destroyed you treasured and worked hard for for years and yelling about it seems normal enough. I don't think it's the right reaction, and she should probably consider trying to not yell next time, but I can understand it.", "How long ago were you 16? They're much better than 10 year olds at handling their emotions, but they're still teenagers. Who are notoriously prone to yelling when upset. She worked hard to pay for those clothes, and when you're in high school, clothes are super important.", "Cool. So do you think OP is the AH or not? Because you haven\u2019t actually given a judgement.  People with additional special needs deserve to be held accountable for their actions too. Over Coddling and not explaining right from wrong and consequences because someone has special needs is detrimental and does a disservice to those with additional needs because it perpetuates the belief that person can\u2019t control and is unable to understand their own actions and behaviours. If I let one of my special needs kids destroy the property of one the other students in my class without me intervening and teaching them that behaviour isn\u2019t appropriate and taking appropriate consequences believe me there would be hell to pay with the parents. If OPs cousin\u2019s situation is that he is completely unable to grasp that concept then the cousin shouldn\u2019t be unsupervised and the aunt needs to monitor him. Either way, It is a failure of the aunt that this situation occurred and OP has a right to be upset and call out her family members about this behaviour. Have a good night.

That is neglect and deserves a call to CPS.\n2.
