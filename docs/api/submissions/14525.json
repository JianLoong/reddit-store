That was sorted, you bought a new bed. \nTbh you could have taken it with you when separated  instead you left it with her, so she got to keep the newer bed.

I'm going to try to explain the logic behind this. \n\nWhether or not OP broke the old bed really isn't the issue. They both used it for around 7 years, given the time frame here. That is a long time to be using a bed between two people, so unless OP body slammed it on purpose, I wouldn't really think it's fair for him to pay for a whole new bed if they typically split things 50/50. However, he *did* use *her* bed for what amounts to 7 years, so you could argue it makes sense that he would purchase the new one if you want to get picky about it. Either way, I find these details a bit negligible. Here's what's more important:\n\nOP and ex decided she would be left the bed. It essentially became her property when they split. When the bed became faulty, she sought to get it replaced and the refund for the old bed would stand for that replacement. Considering the bed only last a couple years before breaking down, and was determined to be faulty, a refund would be pretty standard. This money should go to her since it is in exchange for an item OP left in her possession. \n\nIf she sold the bed after the breakup, would OP be entitled to that money? No. So I do not understand how this is any different. It's in a grey area, OP isn't exactly stealing from her, but it is a crappy thing to do, and reads petty on his part. \n\nBut if we all want to get into the \"fairs fair\" argument, sincerely think about how they used her bed for 7 years. Wouldn't OP owe her money for split use of the furniture? Is that a dumb argument to make because when you're partnering together, it's impossible to calculate expenses perfectly 50/50? What you buy together tends to get blended together, and right now, she's the one who was left a bed in her possession, and she was the one who supplied a bed for the majority of their relationship. He owes her the money back.\n\nYTA.", "How the first bed broke is irrelevant.\n\nThe bed in question was paid for you, true. But during the break-up you gave it to her. It is now hers. She had an issue with it being faulty and the bed company agreed and sent a refund. It is clearly for her, to replace her bed. The fact that it went to your credit card does not make it yours.\n\nIt's like this. If someone gifted you something which broke and you arranged to get it replaced (or the money to replace it as in this case) but the refund went to the gifter's account, wouldn't you expect them to pass that money on to you?\n\nYou are being deliberately obtuse at best, and spiteful at worst.

That's why I asked for clarification on how the bed broke.", "Yes he is", "He was already without the bed. He let her keep the bed in the breakup. \"She continued to use it after we broke up, and is using it now\". So it\u2019s her bed. If it is defective, and the manufacturer agreed, she should get the money from the manufacturer to buy a replacement for what is \"her bed\".", "It's her bed", "Should at least give her half the refund I'd think.", "Dude\u2026 give her the money back. You\u2019re a thief if you dint", "We can't know the truth of what happened to the bed. But at the time, he did accept the responsibility and replaced the bed. He may feel differently now that they aren't together.", "I think they might have been sarcastic? At least, I'd hope so.", "Nah I'm sure there was a lifetime guarantee clause when she accepted the bed haha /s.", "He paid for it. If he gave her the money he would be out of pocket. She got the bed for free.\n\nIf she paid for the bed in the first place, then I'd agree with you. But she didn't, he did.", "Which he gave to her. \n\nWe can argue if taking a gift back is theft, but he could have just taken the bed when they broke up and made her buy another bed.\n\nHe basically gave her free rented furniture for 2 years.", "Even if she didn't pay for half of the bed?", "It's not her money, OP paid for it so the money is his", "She\u2019s the thief", "No check the other comments, big mad", "Exactly which he gave to her. Thank you for backing up my point", "It\u2019s the girlfriend", "Nope", "No the girlfriend knows she didn\u2019t pay for half the bed"]}
