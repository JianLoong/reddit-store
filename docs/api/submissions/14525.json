I'm going to try to explain the logic behind this. \n\nWhether or not OP broke the old bed really isn't the issue. They both used it for around 7 years, given the time frame here. That is a long time to be using a bed between two people, so unless OP body slammed it on purpose, I wouldn't really think it's fair for him to pay for a whole new bed if they typically split things 50/50. However, he *did* use *her* bed for what amounts to 7 years, so you could argue it makes sense that he would purchase the new one if you want to get picky about it. Either way, I find these details a bit negligible. Here's what's more important:\n\nOP and ex decided she would be left the bed. It essentially became her property when they split. When the bed became faulty, she sought to get it replaced and the refund for the old bed would stand for that replacement. Considering the bed only last a couple years before breaking down, and was determined to be faulty, a refund would be pretty standard. This money should go to her since it is in exchange for an item OP left in her possession. \n\nIf she sold the bed after the breakup, would OP be entitled to that money? No. So I do not understand how this is any different. It's in a grey area, OP isn't exactly stealing from her, but it is a crappy thing to do, and reads petty on his part. \n\nBut if we all want to get into the \"fairs fair\" argument, sincerely think about how they used her bed for 7 years. Wouldn't OP owe her money for split use of the furniture? Is that a dumb argument to make because when you're partnering together, it's impossible to calculate expenses perfectly 50/50? What you buy together tends to get blended together, and right now, she's the one who was left a bed in her possession, and she was the one who supplied a bed for the majority of their relationship. He owes her the money back.\n\nYTA.", "How the first bed broke is irrelevant.\n\nThe bed in question was paid for you, true. But during the break-up you gave it to her. It is now hers. She had an issue with it being faulty and the bed company agreed and sent a refund. It is clearly for her, to replace her bed. The fact that it went to your credit card does not make it yours.\n\nIt's like this. If someone gifted you something which broke and you arranged to get it replaced (or the money to replace it as in this case) but the refund went to the gifter's account, wouldn't you expect them to pass that money on to you?\n\nYou are being deliberately obtuse at best, and spiteful at worst. Either way, YTA.", "YTA. She got the bed in the break up, she should get the refund.", "YTA. The bed was hers - you chose not to take it with you following the break up.

No formal decision on whose property it was, just a fluid purchase by a couple. He hasn't had enjoyment of it for 2 years, which was his original expectation. How to prorate that?\n\nWhen they split, they didn't go through a formal divorce, but chose rather to just quickly and cleanly divide up their stuff and try to end things amicably. A fair decision. There was no renunciation of anything, no formal declaration, just a quick and easy separation of property. It's not \"her\" bed for any legal, formal, or moral reason, just that it was an easy decision to make. He might have acted differently if he knew 2 years later it would be an issue.\n\nOP has no idea about or control over the bed since it's left his possession. Did the GF directly play a role in its breakage, or could she have actively prevented it? He has no idea. The responsibility for the breaking is never declared. So it would be dangerous to simply accept her statement at face value.\n\nOP had no idea that GF started the transaction for a refund with the manufacturer... she just contacted him when it was complete. There was no agreement about how this would be handled, financially or logistically. So it's presumptuous for her to assume how things would play out and bind him to the results. \n\nAnd finally... they're giving a refund from a purchase made 2 years ago? I'm... surprised.\n\nGiven the fact that there is no meeting of the minds about anything at any step along the way, it is crazy of her to assume the money is automatically hers.

Last time I had recall work done on my wife's car, the dealership didn't check my id, and when I dropped it off and they said \"we have XXX-XXX-XXXX, is that the best number to call when it is ready?\" I said no, and gave them my cell number instead. I could have been anyone, all they cared about was the VIN. **And I still get recall notices from both GM and a local dealership on a 2011 Malibu I sold two years ago**. I will say it one more time so it sinks in. Automakers and dealerships doing warranty or recall work don't care who a car is registered to or who brings it in, **They. Just. Care. About. The. VIN.**\n\nAnd also, yes, you can request reimbursement for work done on a car that you paid out of pocket for repairs on that you later find out were under warranty or recall. You can even get reimbursement on a repair done that later had a recall issued, I've done it, they mail you a check.\n\nAnd the principle is the same - after the transfer of ownership, the warranty on the bed travels with the owner (or not at all), not the original purchaser. He purchased a bed for both of them to use while they were together, and he left it with her when they broke up, made no attempt to reclaim the bed over a year, and is not trying to reclaim the bed now. Any court of law would consider the bed to be a gift, and legally hers. If the terms of the warranty state that the warranty only applies to the original owner, then the warranty became void when he transferred ownership of the bed to her by leaving it with her for a year without attempting to reclaim it.

If the seller sold the car \"as-is\" and there were transferrable warranties on the car or any equipment on it, then selling it \"as-is\" is legally selling the warranties along with the car. So if the tires are covered by a transferrable warranty, then the new buyer has the right to the warranty payout.\n\nIf the warranty on the tires was non-transferrable, then it became void the minute the seller transferred ownership to the buyer.

The money belongs to her.", "Someone who didn't understand the OP is saying everyone else has zero reading comprehension.  He paid for the bed to replace HER bed that HE broke.

The warranty isn't expired, so she contacts the manufacturing company and it becomes clear her bed is a faulty product.

Unfortunately the company would only refund the money to the bank account the bed was originally purchased with. OP claims he and his ex are still good friends, so I suspect the ex didn't think this was going to be a problem. \n\nBut OP sniffs money, decides to go back on their mutual agreement and claims the bed he gave her more than a year ago is suddenly his again. And therefore he keeps the refund that is meant for the replacement of the faulty bed.\n\nThat's seriously twisted.

GIVING SOMETHING AWAY MEANS YOU NO LONGER OWN IT. So OP hasn't been the owner of the bed for over a year. It's her bed, not his. So the refund for her broken bed is hers, not his.\n\nIt also doesn't matter how broken the bed is, as the company already agreed it's broken enough for a total refund.
