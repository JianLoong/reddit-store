I'm going to try to explain the logic behind this. \n\nWhether or not OP broke the old bed really isn't the issue. They both used it for around 7 years, given the time frame here. That is a long time to be using a bed between two people, so unless OP body slammed it on purpose, I wouldn't really think it's fair for him to pay for a whole new bed if they typically split things 50/50. However, he *did* use *her* bed for what amounts to 7 years, so you could argue it makes sense that he would purchase the new one if you want to get picky about it. Either way, I find these details a bit negligible. Here's what's more important:\n\nOP and ex decided she would be left the bed. It essentially became her property when they split. When the bed became faulty, she sought to get it replaced and the refund for the old bed would stand for that replacement. Considering the bed only last a couple years before breaking down, and was determined to be faulty, a refund would be pretty standard. This money should go to her since it is in exchange for an item OP left in her possession. \n\nIf she sold the bed after the breakup, would OP be entitled to that money? No. So I do not understand how this is any different. It's in a grey area, OP isn't exactly stealing from her, but it is a crappy thing to do, and reads petty on his part. \n\nBut if we all want to get into the \"fairs fair\" argument, sincerely think about how they used her bed for 7 years. Wouldn't OP owe her money for split use of the furniture? Is that a dumb argument to make because when you're partnering together, it's impossible to calculate expenses perfectly 50/50? What you buy together tends to get blended together, and right now, she's the one who was left a bed in her possession, and she was the one who supplied a bed for the majority of their relationship. He owes her the money back.\n\nYTA.", "How the first bed broke is irrelevant.\n\nThe bed in question was paid for you, true. But during the break-up you gave it to her. It is now hers. She had an issue with it being faulty and the bed company agreed and sent a refund. It is clearly for her, to replace her bed. The fact that it went to your credit card does not make it yours.\n\nIt's like this. If someone gifted you something which broke and you arranged to get it replaced (or the money to replace it as in this case) but the refund went to the gifter's account, wouldn't you expect them to pass that money on to you?\n\nYou are being deliberately obtuse at best, and spiteful at worst. Either way, YTA.", "YTA. She got the bed in the break up, she should get the refund.", "YTA. The bed was hers - you chose not to take it with you following the break up.

Their three years sharing a bed together is not part of the equation unless you think the above options are reasonable.

If he got comparable furniture, or explicitly verbally agreed to gifting her the bed, then he\u2019s not only an AH but I imagine she has a pretty good small claims standing to get the money back. Basically, you can\u2019t gift someone something then just take it back. \n\nNormally people tend towards legality over actually assholery here, so I\u2019m utterly shocked at the responses, I think she could absolutely win this in court, and I think he\u2019s a passive aggressive idiot for not taking his own bed in the break up originally and now penny pinching over it (since I\u2019m assuming he has a new bed now and isn\u2019t using this money for a replacement.)", "I mean, he clearly got refunded. If it was her bed to be refunded, the money would have gone to her. Sounds like it's time for her to finally buy herself a brand new bed.", "I see what you mean. I guess in that instance for me op should\u2019ve never bought her a new bed. Her bed was old and if it couldn\u2019t support the weight of her and a guest that\u2019s not really op\u2019s fault.

Sounds like it's time for her to finally buy herself a new bed!", "I get you, but what does the company that sold the bed think? Shouldn't OPs ex asked what card it's going to or if it can be transferred to another card? Was it the companies policy that it must be returned to the original card and she went, okay this will work out for me? Did OP really break the original bed, seems weird she'd continue to throw blame like that. Ultimately, I think no one is trying to be an asshole, they just sound miserable.", "Nah it's his cash. The correct thing to do when you replace is a gift is to buy a new one not get a refund.", "Why is the money not? The bed is hers. It doesn't matter who laid for it, it was given to her. \n\nAnd no, it isn't relevant because a) that was a different bed, b) maybe he did break it, either option is just as likely and c) he already agreed to replace that bed.", "\"Broke up about 1 year ago\" is right there in the post. Not last year. Year ago.", "Are you talking legally? Because if so then no. If you\u2019re talking morally? Then also no", "It's her money, not his. She has every right to claim it. OP gave up ownership of the bed. Do you expect to get refunds from any gift your exes refund/replace/sell? It's ridiculous people are overlooking the moral component here.", "But he didn't give it to her as a gift though. He just left it there \n\n\nShe easily could've just gotten it repaired but chose not to. She played a stupid game and lost. If she knew the refund would go to OP she probably doesn't even try to get a refund \n\n\nI wouldn't give my ex any money either", "The bed isn't hers because he had the proof of purchase. Legally he doesn't owe her anything. She can't prove she owns it. Just because it's in her house doesn't mean anything. He was nice and left it there. He could've easily taken it with him \n\n\nAlso it wasn't her money. HE bought it with HIS money. It was his money", "Yeah, when he paid $400 because she told him to.", "Now, can you show me where he says he didn\u2019t break the bed?", "You are the one who\u2019s manufacturing the argument that he didn\u2019t break the bed. At no point in his post does he said he didn\u2019t break it. He said she told him that he broke it and then he replaced it. That is certainly not saying he didn\u2019t break it.  That is a lot closer to saying he broke it. And I repeated myself because you apparently missed it the first time, since you refused to address it.", "But it is. It's a refund for her bed. The bed she owns. It doesn't matter who paid for it, she owns it.\n\nIf I gifted something to an ex of mine and it broke and they wanted to refund it but the money ended up on my card, I'd be an asshole to keep it. That's what's happened here.", "In my opinion what the company thinks is irrelevant. They have policies in place to protect themselves. They will honor whoever purchased it before but it doesn't mean it's morally or actually his bed. I've worked with companies who would only refund the original card so I can see how this situation can happen. I just can't morally see how it's acceptable for him to keep this money. The legality of it is questionable as well. I don't think anyone here is trying to be an asshole but it's like reddit took the \"crazy ex gf pill\" today and seem to be ignoring her rights here too.", "I don't think he intended to replace the previous bed, just bought so that they could both sleep. I don't see a solid point in any of the comments you made. He didn't leave her the bed because it was a replacement. The fact that he left the bed with her doesn't mean that he loses the ownership of it, and the right to get the refund money.", "My mistake. But she is still not entitled to the money. She had use of a bed for a year after they broke up. There is no evidence he broke her old bed. She would of had to buy another bed at some point, if he didn't buy the ottoman.", "Legally, its ambiguous. Small claims court would have fun with this one. Morally, OP is clearly in the wrong. It's no longer his bed. It's hers. If my ex had to repair/replace/refund the computer I bought her with my card, does that mean its my money? No, absolutely not. It's a clerical error and I should not benefit from that. If the gf was able to refund to her card, do you think OP is entitled to that money too? It's not his bed anymore, it's hers. The money should be hers. It's a black/white situation.", "If we assume that he broke the first bed (which he doesn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t, just notes that she said he did), then the bed is a replacement. It belongs to her, and it\u2019s born out when he additionally leaves it there. \n\nIf you give someone something, it belongs to them. The \u201cvalue\u201d belongs to them. \n\nIf something goes wrong with that thing, the value of it should go to them if there\u2019s a refund. \n\nIt\u2019s simple enough.", "ITT: people who don't know laws about abandoned property. Go google search. Legally the bed is hers.", "So with this logic are you saying you're entitled to any refund or cash from any gift you've given to an ex if they refund it or sell it? The fact that you're hiding behind \"proof of purchase\" doesn't hide the moral ambiguity and that wouldn't hold up in court either. The judge would ask who the owner is. It's her. She's owned the bed for two years without him. Him gifting the bed is irrelevant. She's the owner. Just like the gifts you've gifted any ex, they own it now.", "Not an admission of guilt.", "Again, repeating yourself. You're making up your own conclusions and mistaking it for facts. It doesn't matter how many times you repeat it. It doesn't make it true.", "And she still owns the bed. But she was never entitled to the money, it wasn't hers.", "Yeah nothing in the OP makes her seem too crazy, they were together for 9 years, so they loved each other at one point. If this was me, I would definitely refund the money, because why drag something out unnecessarily? He likely could become the asshole.", "If you leave your stuff in an old apartment for a year, you tend to lose ownership of it unless there was some kind of agreement.", "She had use of the bed for a year yes. Which means it was her bed. Which means if she decides to replace the bed and get a refund because the bed was faulty, the money should go to her. But due to a technicality the money was put on his card. So she's asking to have said refund money transferred to her. How is she in the wrong For wanting a refund on an item she owns?", "But he bought for both of them to use it \n\n\nHe used it for 2 YEARS. The bed is as much his as it is hers. He's entitled to the refund \n\n\nIt's that simple", "So she should use her money to repair it right? Not OPs money? He got the refund and chose not to give it to his ex. Does he have any moral obligation to help his ex?", "Yes it is. And the reason he doesn\u2019t want to replace it is because he\u2019s no longer sleeping on it, not because he says he never broke it in the first place.", "Your only rebuttal to the various points I\u2019ve made is simply that I\u2019m repeating myself. Do you have any other intentions or are you just looking to have a back-and-forth?\n\nIt\u2019s an absolutely true statement that she accused him of breaking the bed and that he replaced it.", "But she is trying to replace said broken bed she owns.\n\nYou know that if you gift someone something and they return it, they generally get the refund, yeah?"]}
