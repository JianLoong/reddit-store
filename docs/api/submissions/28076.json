He needs to realize that it doesn't work like that in all countries, and that kids who grow up in different cultures may not be following the \"expected\" traditions. People growing up in America aren't likely to expect to have to contribute to parental support, especially with the state of American worker pay, where it may take 2 or more jobs to provide enough income for food and lodging.\n\nYou need marital and financial counseling to break this cycle, and if contemplating divorce or separation, you need to have copies of your husband's financial dealings because his income can be considered marital property and may be considered so even though it's \"his\" income. So if he's spending it, he's spending your money rather than just his, but it's not for your family's benefit. This could be considered financial abuse.", "NTA, but you need to meet with a divorce lawyer ASAP.

You deserve a vacation too.\n\nMaybe another option would be to just plan a vacation for you and your friends. Tell him you can\u2019t afford to go with him if he asks. It sounds like you\u2019re gonna be living your own life anyway. Do not have a child with him because you will be a single parent.", "Then i don't see why you can't go on a vaccation?

So now her savings is supposed to cover retirement for both of them and they don\u2019t have enough money to retire comfortably after all.  So no, not okay.  He doesn\u2019t get to spend as he wants because he is part of a married couple now.", "Exactly and if they question why did you take out the money? tell them just like him I gave it to my parent to help them. Have a serious talk with him. Have a financial plan x money goes towards bills, x is for savings and the rest is for whatever you want to do with it. If he uses that to give to his parents that's fine.  But it seems like 2k a month is a lot.", "And if he divorces her, he walks away with half her retirement money", "Assuming they're still together in 30 years. If they are, what would prevent him for divorcing her and taking half the assets that mostly exist because of her. If he can't stop giving money away, he needs to be by himself. It's a good thing they don't have kids. If she was smart, she shouldn't have kids with him. He's too busy financially supporting his parents (why don't they have money?) and wouldn't have time to look after any children."]}
