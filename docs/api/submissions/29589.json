They were playing their last game and were in the running to win first place. \n\nMy son's team was ahead by two, thanks to my son making a goal. In the last quarter, they were down by four. My son was angry that he was switched out last quarter and a weaker player was put in. So my son blamed his coach for a bad call and costing them the game. I reminded my son that you can't play more than 3 quarters and the other kid hadn't played one quarter. He said his coach should had coached better.\n\nHis coach went to pass out a medals to his team and shake his hand but my son refused to shake his hand. I asked my son what the fuck was wrong with him? He said he didn't want to touch his coach. His coach it was okay. I said no, my son is being defiant. It's not that he's uncomfortable with touching people. \n\nI told his coach to bench him at the next game which is a swimming competition. His coach said he wasn't going to discipline a kid for not being comfortable. He said it's fine. Please let it go. I said then I will bench him myself. My son started to cry and we left.\n\nHis coach later emailed me and asked me to cut my son some slack. He's 11 and emotional. I said I can't let this slide. I hate punishing him but my role as a dad is more important.", "created_utc": 1698168886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fidpp/aita_for_telling_my_sons_coach_to_bench_him_next/", "score": 644, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn't want to be roped into what he sees as a parenting issue, and he doesn't have the perspective that you do around why your kid is behaving this way. \n\nIt would be better for you to use another method - even if it involves the sport/activity - to execute the punishment. The outcome might be the same - ie you telling your kid 'I'm not allowing you to play in the next 3 games' but it's not fair for you to tell your son's coach to bench him as part of YOUR punishment. And it might not be appropriate, depending on the expectations of your son's commitment to his team, for you to withhold his participation as part of punishment at all.", "You are not his coach. What you are doing here is actively undermining the coaches authority. If you feel the need to punish your son you can do that at home. You cannot make the coach punish him and you should not try this. The coach makes his own decision - he decides who he benches and who not. He is not you employee. YTA -  not for discipling your son but for using the coach like some kind of subordinate. It's hard enough to get along with a group of preteen boys, the last thing a coach needs are some interfering parents who do not accept his decisions.", "YTA.  If you want to bench the kid, you're within your rights to pull him from the competition and keep him home.  That's something that's within your wheelhouse.\n\nBut if you want him to go to the competition, you're accepting that the coach gets to make the decisions about where and when he's going to participate.", "YTA. You are not parenting well here. You are being way too punitive instead of talking to your kid about how he feels and what better responses would be to his feelings. You're just teaching him to shut down around you and be even more defiant.", "YTA for how you talk to your 11 year old.", "Who asks their 11 year old \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n\nI think you need to look in the mirror and ask yourself that question. YTA\n\nEDIT- I'm appalled at all the people responding to me saying I must be a shitty parent for not wanting to ask my kid the same thing OP asked his. I'm not saying OP shouldn't have talked to the kid or even disciplined him, but yelling What the fuck is wrong with you? at a child is NOT ok.", "YTA\n\nDon't tell a coach they have to play your kid, don't tell a coach they have to bench your kid \n\nPunish him if you feel it's necessary, but don't feel entitled  use the coach as a vehicle accomplish this. He'll do what he thinks is best to manage the team dynamics", "Was thinking N A H until later in the post; YTA. I agree that your son\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t good and warranted your input. But your input was disproportionate. First \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with you\u201d is not appropriate. It also suggests that you have a short fuse in other situations, so I trust your assessments less. This trust is further eroded by the coach: a neutral adult who routinely is in charge of kids in this age group who was indicating that you were overreacting. \n\nI think there\u2019s a way for you to have held your son out of the next match without antagonizing the coach or sharing the upsetting news in public.", "YTA. The coach isn\u2019t required to do your disciplining for you. And asking him to was so incredibly out of line. If the coach wants to bench your kid for unsportsmanlike conduct then more power to him\u2026 but for being defiant to his dad? Nope. And he should have kicked you out for undermining his authority. I wonder where your kid gets his attitude\u2026", "YTA I feel so sorry for coaches when they have to deal with over involved belligerent parents these days. It makes their jobs so much harder. Leave the coach alone and let him coach as he sees fit. You are an adult so you are actually being more disrespectful than your son since you are supposedly able to regulate your emotions. Instead the coach has to worry about the poor example you are setting for your son and his team mates. \n\nCan\u2019t you see that he feels sorry for your child? Do better.   Edit word", "YTA\n\n>I asked my son what the fuck is wrong with him?\n\nWow - who talks to their own children like that? Especially so young. Huge AH way to parent your kid. \n\nYour son\u2019s 11 and quite emotional after they just lost a HUGE game. And the coached recognized this so gave him some slack. His coach showed WAY more empathy and understanding towards your own kid than you. That\u2019s shameful.\n\nIn fact, the coach may actually be glad your son is so emotionally invested in winning because that makes for a much more competitive athlete.\n\nNext time, maybe try talking with your son and letting his coach just coach your son.", "NTA I'm kind of surprised at the comments here/the coaches reaction. What your son did was unacceptable and he's lucky the coach didn't cut him from the team. Getting benched for a game is a perfectly acceptable consequence.", "YTA - stop being an ass your kid is exactly that, a kid. He wil do kid shit. You can\u2019t just punish the kid away and honestly the coach has a lot of good points. \n\nInstead of being - idk, defiant to the coach, just let the man run his team and stop butting in.  If you need o parent your kid do so - just remember, that you\u2019re being an ass here an insufferable.", "Soft YTA, only because with Safesport rules you put the coach in an awkward situation about your kid being disciplined for not shaking/touching his hand. You know it\u2019s due to your kid being a bad sport,  but an outsider looking in or other parents on the team could read more into it. With that said, I coach and have a kid plays lots of sports and I applaud you for coming down on your kid. They know they are the best and this behavior will continue to escalate. Next they will not shake hands with opponents, will argue with refs and escalate their defiance with coaches. We have seen it with many kids when my kid was younger and those kids are now giant toxic assholes because they were never stopped by their parents.  Sports are a privilege as they get older they will have tight conduct rules outside of the game that will get them kicked off the team it\u2019s best they learn this at a younger age.", "For one, most of the literature today is anti punishment. We don\u2019t punish, we discipline. You can\u2019t even use the word punish if you\u2019re a foster parent. So what are you trying to accomplish? It seems like you want him to respect the coach. How will benching make that more likely? How will YOU benching him make that more possible? (It won\u2019t. He can\u2019t respect a coach who gets undermined by parents)\n\nSecondly, the goal here should be for him to learn how to act when you aren\u2019t in the room. That\u2019s the long term goal for sports, clubs, school. He\u2019s going to be on his own in the blink of an eye. Let the natural consequences play out, they\u2019ll work better than anything artificial you put in place. Other players are going to give him the cold shoulder. He might get benched more. His relationship with the coach is different now, even if he didn\u2019t go with your plan. These will all teach the lesson of \u201cwhen I\u2019m a dick, people don\u2019t like it.\u201d You punishing him will teach him the lesson of \u201cmy dad is in complete control of my life.\u201d That second lesson will work until he\u2019s 15 or 16 tops, the first lesson will last a life time. \n\nAs kids get older, our role as dad changes. You\u2019re right in the middle of the change. You\u2019re going to have progressively less control of your son until you have none. But if you switch from attempting to control to attempting to influence, you may get progressively more influence. Some 22 year olds ask their dad for advice. Some don\u2019t call home. The more times you bring down the hammer of god in the teen years, the more likely you are to have a young adult who doesn\u2019t call.\n\nReserve discipline for safety issues, and let natural consequences reign.", "YTA - Let the coach decide how to coach his team. While you do need to talk with your son about his behavior, if you are handling the situation in a manner that caused the coach to reach out to you concerned about how you are treating your son, you are doing something very wrong. When a punishment outweighs the lessen, the lessen is often lost and all the child remembers is to fear the adult. You need to speak with your son about how to handle his emotions better, instead you're allowing your emotions to control how you are handling him.", "Y\u2019all acting like 11 is 5", "I wonder where your son got his attitude from. you should chill out a bit.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a tough lesson, but an important one. He was rude to his coach, disregarded the rules, and cruel to a less skilled teammate.\n\nHe sounds like a good kid who behaved badly in the last game, in a behavioral aberration. But the time to defuse diva behavior is now.", "Personally, I have seen enough undiciplined people in western society to know you're NTA.", "You humiliated your son and behaved badly. You're angry that the coach didn't agree to hurt your son so now you're determined to hurt him yourself. Grow up, asshole. YTA", "NTA , discipline is much  needed teach them young. Don\u2019t be a asshole to your coach", "I appreciate your desire to instill a sense of sportsmanship, but think you\u2019re going overboard. On the field (or pool) the coach handles that. Trust the coach. Offer your support. But it\u2019s important that different adults are involved in his life at this age as role models. I think you need to let the coach take the lead here. YTA.\n\nEdit: PS: what you can do is remember this is a game. If you model that mindset, your son may as well.", "Soft YTA. The coach is the one who will manage the team. Benching your son during a match may not teach him anything and may hurt the team. You wanting to talk to your son about being rude and trying to figure out what he's feeling are separate. The coach needs to determine if there will be punishments for behavior in relation to what he's coaching. You can determine if punishment is needed outside of the the team.", "YTA. Basically, you're saying the coach should be P-o'ed at your kid's behavior. He's not. You don't get to tell the coach who to play, and who to bench. That's HIS choice. Your insisting he bench your kid makes you sound as entitled as all those parents who start screaming that their kids aren't playing enough. Let the coach do his job.\n\nNow, if you want to pull your son off this team as a punishment ... well, that's something only you can decide. If you're thinking of pulling him out of a game every time he misbehaves, I'd rethink that. There's a responsibility, a commitment, to being part of a team. I don't know if you're doing your son any good by showing him how little that commitment means.\n\nETA: There are other ways to discipline your son that don't involve interfering with his relationship with the coach or neglecting his responsibilities to the team.", "I\u2019m not sure. However reframe your \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with you\u201d to \u201cwhat were you thinking\u201d I used to ask my daughter the same question and finally she told me it made her think something was wrong with her and it was a real moment for both of us when she told me that and I explained that I didn\u2019t mean it the way it was said, I wanted to know what was bothering her or what she was thinking when she made certain choices. I\u2019m sad that she felt this way for years and I couldn\u2019t change sooner.", "perhaps a real conversation about sportsmanship would go further than cussing and punishment", "Please handle this yourself in the future.  You shouldn't need to include the coach in this.  Good luck.", "YTA.", "YTA. From the replies alone you seem like you speak to your kid like this all the time which isn't good for his emotions. You also seem to reject feedback from people who are giving you very good feedback in the replies. Get help.", "Sounds like he has your chipper attitude", "Id also say that YTA purely for your responses in this thread.", "I usually hate these terms, but it\u2019s more the whiney connotation behind them but in this case I have to use it, because the shoe fits like it was made specifically for your foot. \n\nYour handling of this definition of toxic masculinity. \n\nYour son had an emotional reaction to a situation that was important to him. Yes he was disrespectful to the coach, yes he could have handled it better. \n\nBut your reaction was to try to force him to swallow the emotions he was feeling and step in line to how you expect him to act. Maybe you think you\u2019re teaching him to be manly and respectful, but really you are teaching him to be an automaton that swallows his emotions and doesn\u2019t rock the boat. What you should be doing removing him from the situation, not publicly shaming him. Then teach him healthy ways to deal with these emotions instead of doing the manly-man BS. \n\nYou asked an 11 year old boy, probably starting puberty, having chemistry changes, to swallow his emotions. \n\nYou could\u2019ve calmly taught him that part of his emotional reaction was because he didn\u2019t have all of the information, like knowing that each player is only able to play 3/4 so that everyone gets a fair chance to play. You also could\u2019ve taught him that not every coach is perfect. Just like not every player is perfect, so yes, coaches make mistakes. But that is his job as a player to play his position and it is the coaches job to organize the tactics and fix the problems at practice. You could\u2019ve talk through it in a calm environment instead of you berating him\n\nInstead, you are the nightmare parent that every coach can\u2019t stand. You emotionally tear your kid down after the coach spent weeks trying to build them up. You interfere with the coaches operation of a team by removing one of his best players because you think he should be benched. It sounds to me like you\u2019re tantrum is worse than the one your son threw. \n\nListen to this, if you\u2019re not a coach, your just a spectator. Your job is to get there on time, cheer, and tell your kid you enjoyed the game/match/meet etc. It\u2019s not your job to critique the performance, offer advice, speak ill of others on the team or staff. Show up on time, watch, cheer, encourage, that\u2019s it. Leave critiquing and analysis to the coach since that is his job.\n\nIt\u2019s our job as fathers to teach our sons to be better not to repeat our mistakes or the mistakes of our fathers. Yes, it sucks when we see our biggest struggles in our own children, teach him to do better teach him to be better.

But YTA your son is 11 and you could\u2019ve used it as a teaching moment for sportsmanship", "YTA and an idiot for not realizing where your son learns his terrible behavior from. telling your son to be a good sport is different than being a positive role model of a good sport for him. \n\njudging from how you escalated to swearing and punitive measures, i doubt you\u2019ve shown him a good example of how to process disappointment or anger in ways that doesn\u2019t involve taking it out on others.", "Your son gets his attitude from you big man. Straighten the fuck up YTA.", "So, let's be clear.\n\nYou're the kind of parent that screams \"what the fuck is wrong with you\" at an 11-year-old.

Parents need to keep their noses out of sports. \n\nClearly you\u2019re son has learned how to be an ass, from his parents. YTA.", "This is a tough one. I lean towards NTA, but maybe a slight change in approach is best. I think you're absolutely right to prioritise instilling a sense of good sportsmanship in your son. His response isn't necessarily unusual for someone his age, but I admire that you recognise that it isn't right and want to correct his behaviour. The problem is that it should be up to the coach to decide whether he is suspended or not, and the fact that he emailed you suggests some concern over that. I suspect that he has seen this all before and has his own way of dealing with it. \n\nImo the best way to go about it is to talk to your son, explain why you're disappointed in him, and say that he can play if he apologises to the coach and doesn't do that again. Make it clear that if he shows bad sportsmanship in future he will be taken off the team. Email the coach back and explain your side of things, but let him make the decisions over disciplining his team. If you want to add additional punishment, do it outwith this so that your wires aren't getting crossed.", "YTA. I hope you enjoy the retirement home in your future. 11 is still a kid and while it\u2019s appropriate to discipline them for behavior like this, it is *not* appropriate to swear at them like that or lash out.

My son was angry that he was switched out last quarter and a weaker player was put in. So my son blamed his coach for a bad call and costing them the game. I reminded my son that you can't play more than 3 quarters and the other kid hadn't played one quarter. He said his coach should had coached better.\n\nHis coach went to pass out a medals to his team and shake his hand but my son refused to shake his hand. I asked my son what the fuck was wrong with him? He said he didn't want to touch his coach. His coach it was okay. I said no, my son is being defiant. It's not that he's uncomfortable with touching people. \n\nI told his coach to bench him at the next game which is a swimming competition. His coach said he wasn't going to discipline a kid for not being comfortable. He said it's fine. Please let it go. I said then I will bench him myself. My son started to cry and we left.\n\nHis coach later emailed me and asked me to cut my son some slack. He's 11 and emotional. I said I can't let this slide.

But if the coach decides not to do it, that's his call since it's his team to run as he sees fit.\n\nIt is also your call whether your son experiences consequences at home. Just keep in mind that your son has a commitment to his team, and pulling him from the swimming competition would be forcing him to let his team down (I'm assuming he'd be competing in a meet as part of a team). Most adults are capable of internalizing that causal chain, but I have my doubts an 11 year old will get what you want from that punishment. Seems far more likely he'll just resent you for making him miss the meet and experiencing the fallout from his teammates, doubly so since his coach specifically said they didn't have a problem.\n\nSeems like an opportunity to sit down with the kid and explain exactly why you think what he did was wrong.
