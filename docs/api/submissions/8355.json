My husband and I with our kid had gone out of station with my BIL, SIL, SIL's father and SIL's cousin. Everything was going well until my nephew saw a car that my son had in his hand and wanted it. \nA little backstory about the car. My son can name all the cars that he sees on the road, though he still can't read or write. I encourage this ability in him by buying him different models of cars every month and hope it keeps him engaged in this hobby till he finds something new. My nephew is also a smart and good kid but he doesn't name them, which is ok, since he is good at other things. So the last time we met, the kids were playing with two of my son's toys and my nephew took one of them home since he started crying when asked to give it back. We have met twice since then and both times he has refused to give it back. If my son was not bothered about the toy I would have left it. But he keeps asking for that specific toy. I had texted my SIL numerous times to get it and she finally got it to the trip and gave it to me when her son was not looking. My son got very happy after he got his car and then he himself suggested giving another car that he had brought with him on the trip to the nephew on the condition by me that he should not ask for it back after giving it to him, and my son agreed. \nMy son was playing with it and my nephew wanted it and not the other car. Their whole family kind of started ganging up on my son asking him to give it back but he refused. I told my nephew to play with the one he has but he kept insisting. My whole issue with it is, i think we should teach kids at a very young age to not take other's stuff. When someone says no, you have to accept it. They can easily buy a new one but they kept expecting my child to give up his car because their child cried. \nMy husband was of no help either. He started emotionally blackmailing my kid to give the car to the nephew or he(husband) won't talk to my son. The kid's grandfather took the car from his grandson and tried to exchange it with my son's car without his knowledge while he was sitting on my husband's lap and my husband did nothing. My kid looked defeated and betrayedand he cried. So i took his car back from the nephew and gave it to my son. After this, i ordered a new one to be given to my nephew but he kept crying anyway. No one spoke to me after that and the whole atmosphere changed. When they left, no one said bye to either me or my son. \nIt's not about the toy for me, it's about the principle of it.

Could it have been handled better?", "created_utc": 1674761186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m04lh/aita_for_snatching_a_toy_from_my_nephew_to_give/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most difficult kids, most crying kids, they know they get what they want, and their parents enable it (I can see having demanding child is difficult for parents).

After a while the child who had been giving asked me she didn\u2019t want to have a playdate with that crying friend anymore because she didn\u2019t want to have to accommodate whatever crying child demanded.\nCrying child parents also told me they were doing \u201cgentle parenting\u201d so they don\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to her, so we couldn\u2019t say anything like \u201csorry this is not her snack/toy so she doesn\u2019t get it\u201d.\n\nNo surprise, the crying child didn\u2019t have many friends because playdate always went same way, so they asked us again and again to have playdate saying no one wanted to play with her. They changed the school because parents were pretty upset crying child didn\u2019t get recommendation for gifted program by class teacher, despite crying child was good at reading & drawing (according to parents). To me, she was totally lacking emotional intelligence and cooperative skill for her age thus no way qualified for advanced curriculum.\nFeel free to do \u201cwe don\u2019t say No to my child\u201d parenting, but don\u2019t expect other friends and families to say Yes to whatever.", "NTA.", "ESH.

They will agree but they can't comprehend it. The only thing you can do is encourage three year olds to \"share\" toys nicely. If they refuse, as both children did, then you must redirect their attention. The right thing to do would've been to remove that toy from play, redirecting both kids toward a new activity. No fault, no scolding, no blame. I think it would've been okay to say \"if you two can't take turns and share then we should just put this toy away\" but others may disagree.
