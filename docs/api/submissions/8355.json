My husband and I with our kid had gone out of station with my BIL, SIL, SIL's father and SIL's cousin. Everything was going well until my nephew saw a car that my son had in his hand and wanted it. \nA little backstory about the car. My son can name all the cars that he sees on the road, though he still can't read or write. I encourage this ability in him by buying him different models of cars every month and hope it keeps him engaged in this hobby till he finds something new. My nephew is also a smart and good kid but he doesn't name them, which is ok, since he is good at other things. So the last time we met, the kids were playing with two of my son's toys and my nephew took one of them home since he started crying when asked to give it back. We have met twice since then and both times he has refused to give it back. If my son was not bothered about the toy I would have left it. But he keeps asking for that specific toy. I had texted my SIL numerous times to get it and she finally got it to the trip and gave it to me when her son was not looking. My son got very happy after he got his car and then he himself suggested giving another car that he had brought with him on the trip to the nephew on the condition by me that he should not ask for it back after giving it to him, and my son agreed. \nMy son was playing with it and my nephew wanted it and not the other car. Their whole family kind of started ganging up on my son asking him to give it back but he refused. I told my nephew to play with the one he has but he kept insisting. My whole issue with it is, i think we should teach kids at a very young age to not take other's stuff. When someone says no, you have to accept it. They can easily buy a new one but they kept expecting my child to give up his car because their child cried. \nMy husband was of no help either. He started emotionally blackmailing my kid to give the car to the nephew or he(husband) won't talk to my son. The kid's grandfather took the car from his grandson and tried to exchange it with my son's car without his knowledge while he was sitting on my husband's lap and my husband did nothing. My kid looked defeated and betrayedand he cried. So i took his car back from the nephew and gave it to my son. After this, i ordered a new one to be given to my nephew but he kept crying anyway. No one spoke to me after that and the whole atmosphere changed. When they left, no one said bye to either me or my son. \nIt's not about the toy for me, it's about the principle of it.

They don\u2019t let others say no either (reason they explain gentle parenting is they don\u2019t want other people to say anything either), and when kids are screaming and fighting, they don\u2019t say anything on the spot because they want to have mature talk in calm environment later. This particular crying friend\u2019s mom sent me message after every playdate (always end with screaming and crying) \u201csorry!

A lot of the time, more so as a teen, I was just expected to give things up because I was nice enough to give things to people sometimes, so it became an expectation.

At the end tell them that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing to a child and the only reason they think it okay is because children can\u2019t speak up for themselves.", "NTA but I wouldn't be visiting these people anytime soon. And wtf is up with your husband? Emotionally blackmailing your 3yr old? He needs therapy.", "NTA. I hate the mentality that kids have to share everything. Adults don\u2019t.

Share and let the other kid play with it for awhile, fine, but he should be able to get *his own* toy back later.  It's not your son's responsibility to provide his cousin with toys.\n\n> ... i think we should teach kids at a very young age to not take other's stuff.\n\nBut you enabled this behavior by the nephew when you forbade your son to ask for *his own* toy to be given back.", "Why would you give your son a toy to play with in front of your nephew that you knew they both wanted. There was zero chance of this not ending in one or both of them crying. You take the toy, put it in your bag and give it back to your son when you get home. This is just common sense. \n\nIt is not your job to teach a child who doesn't share well to learn to share. That is 100% his parents issue. \n\nNow I'm not saying the other adults there behaved well. They behaved terribly and you need to talk to your husband about his parenting, but you cannot control anyone's actions but your own. Your son didn't know the toy had been returned yet and would have been just as happy receiving it after everyone left. Happier as it wouldn't have created this issue.\n\nYour right, parents should teach children to share well and accept no but you are not your nephews parent. You know his parents are not teaching him this skill. You know he will want the car. You know your son wants the car. You know his parents will not step up.

My daughter is an adult now, but I remember that when kids are that age you have to have two of everything.

Toddler nephew doesn\u2019t get any blame as small humans are just learning the foundations of \u2026..well how to human. The family is AH for sure. \n\nAsk your husband why his nephew was worth not talking to his son for? Why your nephew\u2019s desire for your son\u2019s toy superseded your son\u2019s pain/crying? Why does your husband hold the nephew in a higher regard than his son? \n\nI think your husband (hopefully) was just bowing to family pressure and doesn\u2019t think of choosing the nephew over your son.  But that your son may view his father as choosing nephew over him, and tell your husband that. How your child may view you as his only protector (yes it\u2019s about a toy but small kids think different than adults). And what\u2019s wrong for a small human to begin to learn no means no?

You were right to stand your ground and you need to set serious boundaries with your husband and his family.", "ESH, you all suck!

You cannot place boundaries without using the word \"no\".  You are trying to teach respect for the possession's of others.  That is a very good thing to teach young children.  Don't we wish everyone respected other people's belongings?  I am sorry that your husband and his  family seem intent on encouraging emotional manipulation.  That is a loser's attitude and ought to be avoided like the plague.  Stick to your guns.  Boundary placing isn't a popularity contest.", "It's pretty easy to see who the Golden Grandchild is in the family. Imagine bullying a 3-year-old over a toy. Ridiculous!", "When my kids were small, I told them that if they had a special toy they weren\u2019t able to share when we had visitors , we would put it in top of the fridge while the other kids were there.

Funny that you expect my toddler to live with that feeling.\"\n\nYour kid is allowed to keep HIS toy, especially if he already gave up one of his toys to his cousin. It's important to teach kids that they should share *Community Property*, like toys that belong to a day care or community park. It's equally important to teach kids that they can have boundaries regarding their personal items. Expecting a child to forego their treasured toys to appease another child when other toys are available is unfair.", "NTA.

The root of the problem seems to be that they have no idea what's developmentally appropriate. \n\nFor instance, if you're having a conflict with an adult, say your spouse, waiting a few hours and talking about it when calm *could* be the best thing.\n\nBut small kids don't operate like that.", "I have and they are\u2026 something. I agree with you 100%. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019m and aunt and mentor but don\u2019t have kids of my own, so I\u2019m not usually quick to judge how someone else parents\u2026 But my personal belief is that \u201cgentle parenting\u201d method is trash. There\u2019s plenty of room between not yelling or spanking and never saying \u201cno\u201d. I agree, young kids need to be corrected & redirected when it\u2019s happening, not hours later. That\u2019s how they learn, and that\u2019s how we help prepare them for a successful life.
