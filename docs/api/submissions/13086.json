Take a look at your lease about rules on guests.", "NTA it's not his apartment, he doesn't pay the rent and if your room mate wants she can sleep over at his place on occasion. it's your home and he was a guest making demands on you in your home.", "NTA! Partners or housemates who dont \u2018t pay rent and stay over excessively is such a peeve of mine. Hope he continues to stay at his, and the housemate either gets over it or gets out and moves with him.", "NTA he doesn't pay rent, isn't a tenant, and he and your roommate have already shown no care for your own requests, so he doesn't really get a say. \n\nAs a side note from someone who also used to absolutely suck at getting up in the morning - have you looked into alarm clocks for people who are hard of hearing? I bought one that has the regular sound AND a thing I put under my pillow which vibrates and really helps wake me up. It's been a life changer.", "NTA and why can\u2019t she stay over at his place? If they are spending less time together because he can\u2019t sleep over then that doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nOthers have said it, he\u2019s not paying rent and has no say in the matter.", "Couldn\u2019t be less TA", "NTA. Perfect response.", "NTA! It's your apartment, and you already made concessions on the amount of time someone who doesn't pay to live there spends there. What a ridiculous request on his part honestly.", "While I don't agree with the multiple alarms (take your butt to bed earlier!), you're NTA in this instance.  He does not live there and if he is staying that much they should be covering two thirds of the costs.", "NTA.  You were absolutely correct... when he pays a 3rd of your rent and utilities he gets a say.  Until then he is a (reluctantly welcomed) guest and has the ability to sleep elsewhere.", "NTA but your housemate is for allowing her BF to overstay his welcome. He is adding to the utilities (and if you share food, then that too). Not cool and your landlord should know about this unofficial tennent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck", "NTA - Her BF sounds like a jerk.  Hopefully him sulking and blaming you for spending less time with her is an eye opener.", "NTA. If your roommate misses her bf that much, tell her to sleep over there.", "NTA for having alarms or laughing (it\u2019s your home), but I don\u2019t think you have any say over who she has over and when (it\u2019s her home too).", "NTA!   Your apartment and you are paying.   Your response was correct.", "NTA\n\nHe's a guest. You are not. End of story.", "NTA\u2014 you handled it exactly right. He can make requests like that once he starts paying. Your roommate is out of line thinking her boyfriend being over 5-6 day a week is okay. He is essentially living there.", "absolutely NOT!!! you gave the perfect response, you can start caring about his opinions on your alarm when he starts paying a third of the rent.", "ESH. He doesn't get to dictate your household flow as a non-resident. But seriously multiple loud alarms are obnoxious even if your roommate is too polite too complain about it. For your own future self that will have to live with other roommates, partners, etc who won't be so chill, try finding an alarm that works for you. There are many options: light based, haptic (vibrate the bed), wearable watches, etc. Everyone in your future will thank you!", "TF? No. You're NTA. No one should tell you how many alarms you need in your own damn place. Either pay rent, or keep your mouth shut.", "I read about four sentences of this, think that\u2019s all I need. YNTA. Long as you\u2019re living (with your gf) under MY (our) roof, I\u2019ll make the rules when it comes to gosh dern alarm clocks boy!", "NTA \n\nHe's a guest in someone else's home. Why doesn't he have her over to his place if it's that big of a deal?", "NTA. Crazy you need reassurance that you aren\u2019t the asshole here. The bf sounds like an entitled prick like I can\u2019t even IMAGINE sleeping over at someone else\u2019s house then complaining about their alarm like holy shit . Your friends sound like real tools too. Don\u2019t ever be sorry for standing up for yourself", "NTA and all your friends and your roommate are unhinged! Imagine telling someone what to do in a house they pay for but you don\u2019t? Yeah, it\u2019s that stupid!", "NTA get new friends", "NTA. The audacity to ask you to change your habits for his benefit when he isn't on the lease!", "NTA. They can buy noise plugs to sleep if they can't handle it.", "NTA. I\u2019d set another 1 for anytime he\u2019s there. I also use multiple alarms because I tend to shut the 1st one off and doze back off. Plus it\u2019s not his apartment, he can go home", "Not the asshole whatsoever", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t like how you live in your apartment, he\u2019s free to return to his.", "NTA!!!\nyour response was exactly the right one!!\n\nNow you've communicated, he's at least respecting it, unlike your roommate who ignored you. If he's spending less time with her, that's clearly a flaw in the relationship I mean he could take her out, she could go to his, there is so much FREE stuff they could do. \ud83d\ude44\n\nDefinitely NTA!", "When he pays a third of the rent and utilities, he can make those sort of suggestions. Your roommate really needs to talk to him", "NTA.  She wouldn\u2019t accommodate you and you pay rent.  No reason to accommodate the freeloader.", "NTA - he wants to act like a roommate, he can pay fees like a roommate.", "Your complaints were dismissed but you\u2019re rude when you dismiss his?! \n\nHe can set rules in his own place or he can pay rent in your place and you\u2019ll take into consideration what he said, otherwise you have no reason to cater to his feelings. \n\nAlso how is it your fault that the boyfriend doesn\u2019t see your roommate anymore? They can only see each other if it\u2019s in the apartment or something? They can\u2019t see each other outside or at his apartment if he even has one.", "NTA no rent no say.", "NTA.\n\nOh, heck no at people telling you that you should be more considerate of him. Eff that. He\u2019s not paying any bills.", "NTA. Your roommate can stay at her boyfriend\u2019s apartment if she wants to see him more.", "It's not his fkn apartment.  You need to consider absolutely dk about his thoughts and opinions on alarms.  He can stay away.  He can wear earplugs. He can get up or go back to sleep.  But he has absolutely no authority to even ask you.  Your roommate could have asked politely and you still can say no.  But you shouldn't gaf what bf wants. \n\nNTA, Bf is definitely one and roommate is as well.", "Info-  Is he violating your lease by being over there that often?  I would check.", "Exactly, NTA, and your friends are idiots.", "His parents probably wouldn't allow his girlfriend to stay overnight.", "Especially considering the roommate and bf ALREADY trampled all over OPs boundaries when she pretty much said \u201cf u I\u2019m having my bf over as much as I want and you can\u2019t do anything about it\u201d \ud83d\ude44 they both needed a reality check that they don\u2019t own that place. OP is not the freeloader in this situation and the bf is not entitled to anything just bc he\u2019s screwing one of the people living there. Glad she put her foot down about the alarm bc he had some serious audacity trying to confront her about that.", "I used to be in a dorm next to someone who often forgot to turn off her alarm on the weekends, so at 7 a.m. it would start screaming something like, \"WAKE UP AND DANCE WITH ME!\" -- I bet wonderful alarms like that are still available online.", "This, I can't believe that I had to scroll this far to find this take. The boyfriend of OP's roommate is obviously TA because he isn't on the lease for the apartment, yet he's complaining about the place where he essentially stays at rent-free. However, OP is also TA for setting multiple alarms to wake up. Just because that OP's roommate hasn't raised any concerns yet regarding the alarms doesn't mean that she's not getting irritated by the multiple alarms, she may not have to be up as early as OP. Therefore, the correct judgement is ESH.", "u/Brigheddfhj is a bot.", "This was my exact thought when I read the last sentence.", "Lmao \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nTake this \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udfc5", "That level of burn is gonna need a lot of cream. I mean a *lot*.", "Set more alarms.", "If it\u2019s that important that he wake her up, He should wear earplugs. I\u2019m an extremely light sleeper and that\u2019s what I do when it\u2019s necessary.", "The boyfriend might not even know he's making OP uncomfortable, he might have thought he's perfectly welcome, so I can see how being laughed at and told to pay rent might have seemed extremely rude to him.", "come over != live there\n\nand that's what he's doing", "But then they wouldn't have OP subsidizing the rent!", "fr - just when he\u2019s staying over though.", "This is the way", "I had a feeling that's what you were you suggesting. I love this.", "I want that, too!  I regularly change my alarm sound/song on my phone because otherwise I just eventually integrate the current song into my dreams and don't wake up.  I think this one would last a good long time!", "That is amazing", "Who cares what he thinks in this scenario? If he\u2019s so entitled that he thinks he can dictate what someone days in their own home where he\u2019s a \u201cguest\u201d who stays there the majority of the time and doesn\u2019t pay then fuck his opinion", "Can you imagine?!", "There\u2019s a long version too with a much bigger buildup, but I like the one that gets straight to the point!", "I found the file on twitter and made it into an iPad ringtone so, thanks for revolutionising my wake up experience.", "Awesome! Enjoy getting super pumped up from now on."]}
