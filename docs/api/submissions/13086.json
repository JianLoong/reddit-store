She essentially shut me down over it and said that she doesn\u2019t see the issue since the majority of the time he stays in her room so I dropped it.\nNow onto the new issue, I\u2019m an extremely heavy sleeper and I set multiple alarms in the morning so I can wake up on time. I told my roommate about this early on and she had no problem with it since she too is a heavy sleeper. Apparently her bf is not, a couple days ago he approached me in the morning, he woke up to my alarm and told me to set less alarms because I wake him up hours before he has to be at work.

You didn't even want him there that often in the first place. Your complaints were dismissed, and you just let it go. Your roommate knew you'd use multiple alarms, and still agreed to move in.

He can sleep in the appropriate domain should he  object.", "NTA.

Time to move out or get a new roommate to replace the two you now have.", "NTA. You told your flatmate before moving in so I think it\u2019s fine. Your flatmate could go to his place if she wants to spend more time with him?", "So I have no clue what everyone else is gonna say here, but I\u2019m going with NTA. You cleared this with the other person on the lease, and there is a third person living with you unauthorized (likely against the lease) that you have asked not stay so many nights. I agree with you that until he pays rent, he doesn\u2019t get a say. But, be prepared for your roommate to change her mind about the alarms, and then unfortunately you will likely need to change how you set alarms (have you tried light based alarm clocks? I haven\u2019t but see ads for them all the time, might be something to consider).", "NTA.  You should have set up even more alarms", "NTA\n\nI agree with you.

Now you know how to eliminate him from your apt,.like an unwanted roach, i would encourage you to increase the nbr of alarms, make them louder and more obnoxious.\n\nYour friends are mistaken.  Your roommate should've been more considerate of your reasonable request to limit her bf's visits.  And since she ignored your request, he should have to split the water, sewer, electricity, cable, internet and the rent should be split 3 ways.  It is not fair to you, you didnt agree to 2 roommates.\n\nYou should check your lease there may be a clause about other people not being able to stay unless they are on the lease.", "NTA. He neither lives there nor he is your guest. The audacity of this guy to demand that you change your routines to suit him.", "NTA. Its not his apartment, he doesnt get to tell you how to live in your own apartment. Could you maybe not have laughed his concerns off, sure. But then again, it sounds like he basically demanded that you set less alarms instead of even asking you nicely about it.", "Info: Why doesn't your roommate go stay at his place some nights? \n\nAlso, NTA.", "Info Is your alarm Bring me to life by Evanescence? Because I really feel like that would help get your point across", "NTA. You have multiple alarms to wake you, and you made sure to find/have a roomate who was OK with this. You're not setting alarms to annoy him; you're setting them to wake up in the morning. As he's not your actual roomate, you didn't have the opportunity to screen him for his alarm clock expectations--there's no way for you to have known about that.\n\nThe fact that he - a guest in your home - felt entitled enough to **tell** you to use fewer alarms definitely makes him TA here. (Requesting very, very nicely would've resulted in an N-A-H vote from me.) What's up with him acting like there's no solution but fewer alarms anyway? I mean, he could've tried earplugs or something.\n\n(BTW, OP unrelated: as a fellow-multi-alarm user myself, I highly recommend both a rising light alarm (come up gradually) and the sonic boom alarm (which has a bedshaker component) -- if you don't already have them, of course. They've helped me cut down on the number of alarms I need in the morning.)", "NTA- You already okayed the multiple alarms by your roommate early on and he is not on the lease. Why should he get a say in what happens at the apartment? I don't think you were rude about it and there isn't a compromise to be had.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need a new roommate", "NTA. Roommate can stay at his place too.", "NTA \n\nHe can go home.", "NTA. He doesn't live there or contribute to the bills. His comfort is irrelevant and he has no right to request anything of you. You were much nicer than I would have been.", "NTA - Good answer!! Seems like the problem took itself out. lol", "NTA. He doesn't pay bills, he has his own place. I would of laughed too.", "NTA but your roommate can go spend the night with her boyfriend at his place. If she has such issues about him not spending any time with her.", "NTA he doesnt live there AND doesnt contribute. You need to set more alarms.", "NTA, but if you really need multiple alarms to wake up you might have a sleep or other medical problem.", "NTA, you should have talked about people staying the night before she moved in, but you're still right in this case, he isn't officially living at your place, he isn't paying rent, and your roommate, who is paying rent one of the weekends beforehand and was okay with it.

Boyfriend has no right to complain about almost anything in the apartment that he's a guest in at best.  Having multiple alarms go off at multiple times early in the morning loud enough to awaken someone in the other room - that's a-hole behavior.  \"I'm a heavy sleeper\" isn't a valid excuse.  Just because your new roommate hasn't called you out for it specifically yet doesn't mean you aren't pissing her off as well.  It's been two months - I imagine you have at least 10 to go.", "YTA just for trying to limit how often her boyfriend is there. Why is 3nights a week better than 5? Also it should only take one alarm to wake you up in the morning, but I'll agree that that is up to you in your apartment. It's not up to a squatter to tell you how many alarms to set.
