We have her in several therapies, including feeding therapy. For the time being, however, there\u2019s very little she\u2019ll eat. Per the the therapist\u2019s recommendations, we always give her her safe foods, while encouraging her to try new ones. Her main safe foods are grilled cheese, butter noodles and nuggets. There are other snack type things she\u2019ll eat, but that\u2019s it in terms of meals.\n\nWe\u2019re hosting Christmas this year. My husband and I plan on making a variety of food (ham, turkey, lasagna, various sides, etc). I also am going to make buttered noodles and nuggets so my daughter has two of her safe foods. I plan on making enough so if anyone wants them, they can eat them too. We have a lot of kids coming, so I figured it was best all around. Our holiday meals are always serve yourself, so people can eat what they like and leave what they don\u2019t. \n\nI sent out the menu to everyone last night. My brother called me about an hour later. He asked why I was serving chicken nuggets and buttered noddles at Christmas. I explained why and he said that he\u2019d prefer I didn\u2019t, because then his kids are going to want some. My brother and his wife are anti-junk food and it\u2019s been a bit of a problem in the past. I\u2019m all for healthy eating and always provide an array of foods, but I also don\u2019t hold back on serving on other foods. In the past, this has caused tantrums on my niece and nephew\u2019s part because my brother and SIL will tell them they can\u2019t eat something that my kids are. My brother said they don\u2019t want a fight this Christmas. Keep in mind, there are foods being served that my SIL and brother allow their kids to eat. They just know they\u2019ll want the noodles and nuggets if they see my daughter or anyone else eating them. \n\nI said that I was going to provide my daughter with options and I\u2019m not going to hold back given his kids. I pointed out that if I didn\u2019t have these things, my own daughter may get upset. He said that I need to teach her to eat \u201clike everyone else\u201d. We\u2019ve explained her AFRID and autism before, so he\u2019s more than aware that this isn\u2019t a matter of her being picky. He says that he wants a peaceful Christmas. I said I do too, so the menu isn\u2019t changing. He can either allow his kids one day with junk food OR he can tell them no and handle the outcome. No judgment either way. He got huffy but agreed.\n\nMy mom feels like I should feed my daughter separately but that\u2019d mean she\u2019d be left out from the meal or would have to sit there not eating while others did. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702319695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g0hjv/aita_for_not_changing_the_christmas_menu/", "score": 631, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Christmas and Thanksgiving are pretty calorie heavy feasts.", ">I'm no expert on amarican Christmas food. Or when it's Thanksgiving. But is the food served at those two holidays 100% fat-free or something?\n\nWell first, a healthy diet dosen't need to be (and probably shouldn't be?) 100% fat free. Eating healthy isn't about always eating all fat free no carb roasted vegetables for every meal. Teaching kids to eat healthy means teaching them try and eat a variety of foods, getting a variety of nutrition, including a good amount (but dosen't have to be all) of plants, and listening to their body cues on when they are hungry/full. Healthy meals or healthy diets can and often do include fats, ranging from in meat to avocados to etc. In general, it is true that it is \"healthier\" when people eat less ultra-processed foods and added sugars. I'm sure there's a lot of specific distinctions in there but it works as an easier way for people judge things without having to go too far into the nutrition science of each thing. \n\nThat said, no Christmas food isn't all \"healthy\" foods in most families. For example, if nothing else most families have a good about of dessert(s) with Christmas. Now, this isn't bad. It's actually usually better for kids to learn moderation than complete restriction of \"less healthy\" foods. And I personally don't think rare holidays need to be about moderation of treats anyway. \n\nI allow my kids treats and I allow them to have chicken nuggets sometimes. I'd personally prefer if we didn't serve nuggets at Christmas dinner beacuse I've found with my kids they are much more open to trying different things if you don't stick an item like that in front of them. So my family makes a special beef and carrot stew with orange peel, fennel, etc for Christmas. It's a little outside my older kid's comfort zone (she's more picky then my younger one) and I know that if there were nuggets she would just eat those instead. My younger one loves vegetables, salad, etc. So while she loves mushrooms and bok choy etc and asks me to make them, if I put them side by side with chicken nuggets and fries she'd just eat the nuggets and fries then get full and not have room for the veggies. One thing that helps a lot with my younger one is when we serve something first, like if we are a restaurant and we order a salad that comes an appetizer she'll love it and eat a bunch. And while Christmas dinner is not a meal I care about being healthy exactly, I care about sharing appreciation of cultural holiday foods across generations. So if my kids were given something else that would very likely make them not eat the family tradition foods I would be bummed.\n\nThat said, OP is not an asshole.

Therein lies the biggest, but not only, difference between picky eating and AFRID - the lack of a chemical signal in the brain to tell someone they're hungry to begin with makes food not a priority, thus leading to people with AFRID simply not eat unless they're made to. Other differences include things like picky eaters enjoying the sensory experience of foods they'll eat, while those suffering with AFRID will be repulsed by things like texture, smell, flavour, or even foods touching one another on their plate, picky eaters growing out of this phase typically by age four while AFRID can persist into adulthood, and picky eaters typically having a pool of > 30 foods, while those with AFRID normally only eat 20 types of food or less.\n\nIt's relatively recent, sure, being classed as its own disorder in 2013 (I believe it was lumped in as a form of anorexia before this but I may be wrong), but so is our understanding of the brain enough to learn about these things at all.
