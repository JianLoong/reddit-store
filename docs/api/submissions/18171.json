Your mom might actually SAVE SOME MONEY by not buying placebo pills?!? How are you actually upset that somebody with a specific type of education speaks on that education in a practical manner for the people they care about? If you had a solid education in say, construction and engineering, and your relative was bolstering on with a structurally unsound project would you consider it to be maliciously arrogant to tell them what they can do to improve that? \n\n>Or told my wife about a few things when she was pregnant, despite the fact that she's not an OB/GYN- she's a cardiologist.\n\nShe told your wife a FEW things? What unbridled arrogance how dare she?! Moreover, how arrogant do YOU have to be to assume that a doctor in a specialty is so uninformed about anything outside of that specialty that they could never be able to speak from a more informed standpoint than somebody who read a few \"mommy and me\" books in preparation to being a parent? \"Oh but she's a cardiologist,\" yeah which means she went to medical school, did internship and residency, all before she became a legitimate cardiologist. She has definitely worked with more than one pregnant person at this point.

A relative is asking a relative about career advice so they can make a more informed decision and that UPSETS you? Or does it upset you because you're not the one being sought out for advice here? Your young cousin has an important decision to make in terms of choosing a degree path and future career trajectories, and it upsets you that your SIL is giving more than grunts and one word answers! That's ridiculous!\n\nBeing a medical doctor **is** a rewarding and special field. And the stress a medical doctor experiences can never be defined by a financial sum. That is all honest! **You have the lives of other people in your hands** when you serve that position! There is no monetary sum to define that kind of stress and responsibility and it's ridiculous that you're upset at that being expressed by somebody with direct experience in that line of work?! You may as well be asking her to define the value of a human life in dollars if it upsets you when she says that there is no monetary value to put on this line of work. \n\nYou owe her an apology and you need to seriously **reflect on why SIL being proud of her career and speaking from a place of expertise to other family members makes you this upset.** Because from where I stand all of it sounds like it's coming from your own feelings of inadequacy. **Focus on yourself instead of being so unhappy over somebody else's abundance of happiness.**", "Yta you sound like you've got an inferiority complex", "YTA\n\nYou sound really jealous of your SIL's career.

SIL is 33, which means she only recently started her actual career as a cardiologist. Cardiology is one of the most demanding medical specialties, so it actually takes somewhat longer to get through all of the education to become a cardiologist. That's actually something to brag about occasionally, and it's definitely something that has earned the person the right to talk about the medical profession in general, since a lot of the info is still so fresh to them.\n\nDifferent specialties have different educational time lines as far as how long their residency is, etc, but virtually all new MDs in the US are required to do rotations--some amount of time learning all aspects of medicine, one specialty at a time. For instance, a radiologist (not to be confused with a radiology tech), who spends most of the time looking at X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc, can do minor surgery. A radiologist saved my life with a minor procedure right on the CT scanning table once, but I digress.\n\nI go to my local university-based hospital because I know that I'll get some of the best, state-of-the-art care there. I also know that a newly minted MD has to learn how to treat their patients' illnesses **somewhere**, and that means diving in and getting their hands dirty, so to speak. By going to that hospital, I'm giving those new doctors valuable experience they may not have gotten otherwise.\n\nMedical education doesn't happen in a vacuum and then suddenly you're a cardiologist pulling down six figures or whatever the going rate is now. There is a lot of hard work involved, not to mention the expense. OP really has no idea of the sacrifices SIL had to make to get where she is.

They are so sure they\u2019re right they ignore patients lived experiences. That OP\u2019s wife, who got the unasked for obstetric advice, is on his side indicates that SIL is no different than the politicians that think they know best about women\u2019s healthcare and women aren\u2019t capable of making informed decisions with her doctor.

Internal/ family medicine you feel like a real doctor because you're filling that role and the attending just double checks your work. You drive home feeling like you made a difference. When you do OBGYN especially as a man, you're sidelined the whole time and don't learn much.   Pediatrics I found super boring because 9/10 times nothing is wrong or they have a cold or its acne issues.

I found psych rewarding though. \n\nOf you're not all in at this point, I suggest a career change to a mid-level (NPs, PAs etc..) you pretend to be a be a doctor, you make good money, a lot less responsibility. NPs with little training make good money and ruin people's health all the time with little to no consequence. They refer and do unnecessary diagnostics all day when they can't figure it out and then just reschedule you to see a doctor. Easy easy gig.

There are some people out there, like myself who wouldn\u2019t like it. if someone saw me taking a medicine or whatever the scenario may be, and then try to give me their opinions on it, or ask me invasive questions like if I talked to my doctor about it, because that\u2019s my business and no one else\u2019s unless I tell it to them. I\u2019ve seen a lot of doctors especially online, who like to give unsolicited advice or who like OP described makes being a doctor their entire personality. I\u2019ve had it happen to me once, and I was pissed because they had no right to be making assumptions or commenting on anything regarding my medical treatment because they aren\u2019t my provider and know nothing about me so to me that\u2019s just being nosey/acting like you know everything because you have some sort of degree. \n\nBut all in all, i commend doctors and nurses everyday for what they do because I couldn\u2019t do it especially surgeons, and I agree OP is the AH for the way they went about things and acting like a toddler", "First two thing I was thinking while reading OPs submission.

The problem only arises when their scope exceeds their knowledge and training, which - if you\u2019ve encountered clear medication errors like the ones you describe - is definitely a huge issue. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to throw the baby out with the inadequate amniotic fluid.", "I suspect his wife\u2019s agreement is more of a sighed \u201cyes dear\u201d while he rants.", "When i was in nursing school, this is one of the reasons they told us  not to wear our uniforms if we were commuting on public transport, especially if we weren't confident in helping in an emergency situation. \n\nIn most cases people are just going to look for the person in uniform to assist, they won't know/care that it could be your first day out. Theoretically, we were taught, but having the experience to put your knowledge into action in an uncontrolled environment  is a little bit different.\n\nAlso YTA OP  you sound like a silly goose.", "These people are in charge of your health and your life. Are you really ok with them having an online degree? The degree mills for NPs is a huge issue. \n\nIf you're ok with clowns handing out referrals/labs  for no reason sure go for it. If you're ok with a clown writing you prescriptions that literally have no idea how they work have fun. \n\nNext time an NP writes you a prescription ask them how the drug works. Report back with your results. You might be an NP and look up how it works. If you're an NP realize you get paid lots of money to do nothing."]}
