Your mom might actually SAVE SOME MONEY by not buying placebo pills?!? How are you actually upset that somebody with a specific type of education speaks on that education in a practical manner for the people they care about? If you had a solid education in say, construction and engineering, and your relative was bolstering on with a structurally unsound project would you consider it to be maliciously arrogant to tell them what they can do to improve that? \n\n>Or told my wife about a few things when she was pregnant, despite the fact that she's not an OB/GYN- she's a cardiologist.\n\nShe told your wife a FEW things? What unbridled arrogance how dare she?! Moreover, how arrogant do YOU have to be to assume that a doctor in a specialty is so uninformed about anything outside of that specialty that they could never be able to speak from a more informed standpoint than somebody who read a few \"mommy and me\" books in preparation to being a parent? \"Oh but she's a cardiologist,\" yeah which means she went to medical school, did internship and residency, all before she became a legitimate cardiologist. She has definitely worked with more than one pregnant person at this point.

A relative is asking a relative about career advice so they can make a more informed decision and that UPSETS you? Or does it upset you because you're not the one being sought out for advice here? Your young cousin has an important decision to make in terms of choosing a degree path and future career trajectories, and it upsets you that your SIL is giving more than grunts and one word answers! That's ridiculous!\n\nBeing a medical doctor **is** a rewarding and special field. And the stress a medical doctor experiences can never be defined by a financial sum. That is all honest! **You have the lives of other people in your hands** when you serve that position! There is no monetary sum to define that kind of stress and responsibility and it's ridiculous that you're upset at that being expressed by somebody with direct experience in that line of work?! You may as well be asking her to define the value of a human life in dollars if it upsets you when she says that there is no monetary value to put on this line of work. \n\nYou owe her an apology and you need to seriously **reflect on why SIL being proud of her career and speaking from a place of expertise to other family members makes you this upset.** Because from where I stand all of it sounds like it's coming from your own feelings of inadequacy. **Focus on yourself instead of being so unhappy over somebody else's abundance of happiness.**", "Yta you sound like you've got an inferiority complex", "YTA\n\nYou sound really jealous of your SIL's career.

How dare this fancy pants mechanic attempt to tell me about my truck! \n/s", "??????\nthe she being used is referring to the sister not the op.", "Yeah, especially mineral supplements like iron and calcium can really mess up the effect of other prescription medication, like some antibiotics and medication for hypothyroidism.", "If I were a doctor, and saw someone taking a supplement that could be harmful, I would say something. It could be as simple as \u201chave you talked to your doctor about that supplement?\u201d", "It depends on tone and if there is a history of it. It really does, at least to me \n\nI can totally see her as an obnoxious narcissist (like my mother going for her doctorate)\n\nI'm not saying this is what she is. I'm saying I can't tell without knowing the tone of voice", "Is it wrong I want to know more? Like seriously OP, lie down on the couch, relax. Tell us how you really feel?", "I wonder if OP \u201cdoes their own research.\u201d", "Yeah, and I bet a cardiologist could deliver a baby too", "I mean, tbf, I have an acquaintance who is a psychiatrist, and he told me once that IN THEORY he would and could assist at a birth if there was literally no one else, and he would do his best at a trauma emergency, but he wouldn't go out of his way to volunteer for the good of all involved.", "Yeah my mom takes thyroid meds and her doctor told to wait 4 hours after taking it to take vitamins. Also some may mess with birth control and then you have a surprise pregnancy", "The person ASKED about her career. And if THAT specific person has a problem with her, they probably wouldn't have asked her in the first place and could say something themselves. King OP doesn't need to be involved regardless.", "You're certainly not the only one! The first thing I did after reading the post was look to see if OP had any comments, because I, also, desperately wanted to read more about OP's (seemingly obsessive) hatred of his SIL.\n\nI mean, there definitely has to be more to this story. Is OP bitter about some crush of crush/attraction to the SIL? Is OP a homophobe? Is OP just jealous of her success and comfortable life?\n\nWe need to know!", "As a medical professional, I think that mostly that is because it's not their specialty. Could they, or I assist or manage a non complicated birth- sure probably... But the problem comes in when something isn't routine and it isn't something you regularly or could in a real way, possibly deal with. There's a huge difference in knowledge and practice of in medicine/nursing.\n\nSo I definitely don't fault a psychiatrist for saying that they'd only step up in an actual emergency situation where they were the only person with any sort of the necessary training for that situation. But an MD that specialized in psychiatry isn't going to have the same experience as an OBGYN or even an ER physician in a situation like that, so tbh I get their perspective.", "Yeah, but hey, Worf delivered a baby successfully. It's not a high bar. :)", "Maybe OP is just jealous that a gay woman has a better paying job than him.", "Now I wanna too, sounds like a soap opera to me lol.", "Is it wrong I went there too\u2026\nLike he\u2019s not ok with a woman or a gay person (let alone both!) to be confident and successful! \nAnd his wife agrees, agh! (Or at least he thinks she does)"]}
