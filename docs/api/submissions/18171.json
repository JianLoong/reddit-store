Also YTA", "YTA\n\nThe insecurity radiating off your post is intense", "I'd be damn proud of my profession too if I was a doctor. YTA.", "YTA. You need to hone your social skills.", "YTA\n\nDude, the kid literally asked her about her job.", "YTA. \n\nShe talked about normal career things in a conversation that didn\u2019t involve you. \n\nYou reek of jealousy.", "YTA. So you butter into a conversation That didn\u2019t include you because another person was talking about their career?", "YTA. You just sound totally insecure. How embarrassing.", "YTA- I can smell the insecurity from here. It doesn't sound like she outright brags about being a doctor. Yes, most people are working, but I think being a doctor is a tremendous accomplishment.", "YTA\n\nWhat you have described is not an unhinged level of arrogance and unearned pride.\n\n>She goes all out to comment on every supplement my mom takes, and tells her which ones necessary, which one isn't.\n\nOH THE HORROR. Your mom might actually SAVE SOME MONEY by not buying placebo pills?!? How are you actually upset that somebody with a specific type of education speaks on that education in a practical manner for the people they care about? If you had a solid education in say, construction and engineering, and your relative was bolstering on with a structurally unsound project would you consider it to be maliciously arrogant to tell them what they can do to improve that? \n\n>Or told my wife about a few things when she was pregnant, despite the fact that she's not an OB/GYN- she's a cardiologist.\n\nShe told your wife a FEW things? What unbridled arrogance how dare she?! Moreover, how arrogant do YOU have to be to assume that a doctor in a specialty is so uninformed about anything outside of that specialty that they could never be able to speak from a more informed standpoint than somebody who read a few \"mommy and me\" books in preparation to being a parent? \"Oh but she's a cardiologist,\" yeah which means she went to medical school, did internship and residency, all before she became a legitimate cardiologist. She has definitely worked with more than one pregnant person at this point. Or do you think pregnant people never speak to cardiologists or any other doctor besides an OB/GYN?\n\n>After dinner, one of our youngest cousins (he started college just last year) was talking to SIL about her career. She went into detail about it, how hard it was, how rewarding and special it was, and how no matter what others said, the stress they were under could not be compensated for financially.\n\nAre you for real OP? A relative is asking a relative about career advice so they can make a more informed decision and that UPSETS you? Or does it upset you because you're not the one being sought out for advice here? Your young cousin has an important decision to make in terms of choosing a degree path and future career trajectories, and it upsets you that your SIL is giving more than grunts and one word answers! That's ridiculous!\n\nBeing a medical doctor **is** a rewarding and special field. And the stress a medical doctor experiences can never be defined by a financial sum. That is all honest! **You have the lives of other people in your hands** when you serve that position! There is no monetary sum to define that kind of stress and responsibility and it's ridiculous that you're upset at that being expressed by somebody with direct experience in that line of work?! You may as well be asking her to define the value of a human life in dollars if it upsets you when she says that there is no monetary value to put on this line of work. \n\nYou owe her an apology and you need to seriously **reflect on why SIL being proud of her career and speaking from a place of expertise to other family members makes you this upset.** Because from where I stand all of it sounds like it's coming from your own feelings of inadequacy. **Focus on yourself instead of being so unhappy over somebody else's abundance of happiness.**", "Yta you sound like you've got an inferiority complex", "YTA\n\nYou sound really jealous of your SIL's career. Why?\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nWould you have been as offended if your SIL had been, say, a BIL?\n\nI mean, we can't have educated women in high-powered jobs now, can we?\n\nEspecially those who, ahem, prefer women.", "YTA,\n\nCousin asked and why are you so offended?", "Lol you're the snowflake here. Insecure asshole. YTA. Should have studied in school to make something out of your life", "Yeah YTA. If you have an issue with her, don\u2019t invite her to your home? There\u2019s no reason to create conflict in front of anyone. You also could have just pulled her to the side later and told her what your issues were. There were loads of more respectful ways to go about doing this.", "YTA It doesn\u2019t sound like she thinks she better at all. What\u2019s wrong with her giving advice and talking about her job? It sounds like you feel very insecure. I\u2019m sorry that you do and I don\u2019t want to sound harsh, but that\u2019s you\u2019re problem. You shouldn\u2019t take that out on your SIL. She absolutely didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that.", "YTA\n\nThe cousin was specifically seeking input about CAREERS and the SIL was responding to that - and giving the pros and cons of her career choice. \n\nAnd as others have posted, a cardiologist has at least done a rotation and learned stuff that would enable them to casually advise people on supplements or pregnancy - most people would be delighted to have friend or relative who they could check things with.\n\nFWIW, many cardiologists actually have practices where they are a person's primary care physician. My father's PCP was a Board certified cardiologist  but he wasn't a cardio surgeon who would do open heart surgery.", "YTA! Your jealousy is showing!", "This entire post makes you seem pathetic.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  It doesn't sound like she did anything wrong and she also tried to diffuse your irrational behavior.  She is likely just trying to help with what education/knowledge she has.  If you, or anyone else, doesn't want her advice just tell her that.  However, someone asked her a question, she answered, and you blew up based on your interpretation of what she had to say.", "Yta, you sound very insecure and you attacked her for answering someones question, it's not like she brought it up without being asked but even then your response is really rude. Being a doctor is an extremely difficult job and she's proud of herself, why can't you be proud of her too?", "You decided to get all up in arms and butt into a conversation that was not about you, did not involve you, or even mildly related to you? And you somehow wrote all this out in a post and still thought you weren\u2019t absolutely ridiculous for doing it? \n\nYour younger cousin talks to your SIL about her career and SIL responds appropriately about her career. YTA.", "YTA. She was asked a question about her work. She answered. How did this become about you and the chip on your shoulder?", "Your SIL answered a question thoughtfully, and handled an insecure, rude interruption with grace. She appealed to her partner quietly and let your sibling come to you privately. She actually *is* better than you, and me too. But not because she\u2019s a cardiologist, she just sounds like a well-adjusted grownup in a healthy relationship. YTA.", "NGL while I've worked with some doctors who had a superiority complex, this doesn't sound like it. It sounds more like *you* have an *inferiority* complex. YTA dude. Some of these conversations make your SIL's career pretty relevant, and like she's just sharing knowledge.", "YTA this sounds like a you problem not a her problem", "YTA. You sound jealous and insecure. She was talking about her career. Nothing in your post suggested she\u2019s better than anyone else. I don\u2019t know any medical professional that doesn\u2019t give solicited or unsolicited medical advice to their family members. It\u2019s what what they\u2019re trained for years to do and they do it all day so it\u2019s hard to stop doing it when they\u2019re off the clock.", "YTA\n\nGreen isn't a nice color on you", "Yta i guess\u2026\n\nYoure upset cause a cousin asked and she went into detail how hard it was to be a doctor which it is\n\nHow rewarding it is. Which it is.  How special it is, which it is.  How incredibly stressful. Unappreciated. Malpractice risk it is,  they are heroes at least some of society think of them as heroes\n\nYou jealous the cousins didnt ask about your career and called her out?", "YTA.  The combination of insecurity and hostility is really pathetic. Knock that chip off your shoulder and apologize.", "YTA, you really got mad that she spoke about her career after being *asked* about her career? Get a grip", "YTA \nDo you know that in order for her to became a cardiologist she had to go throw ALL the specialities? So she knows a bit of everything. Plus, she was talking about college with your cousin, what is your problem? Yes, you all work, but she busted her ass for 10 years or more to get were she is.", "YTA, you unprovoked attacked her during a conversation you were not in any way a part of.  Nothing you\u2019re relaying in any way supports your attitude. It sounds more like you have some insecurities around your job choice and you\u2019re threatened by her. Do better.", "You definitely seem like an AH from what I'm reading. Maybe give a specific situation with almost exactly what was said and done cause your interpretation may be wrong and you might need to do some work on yourself.", "YTA. she sounds lovely for helping your family and offering helpful advice. she wasn\u2019t randomly talking about her job, she was asked a question and she answered. you sound deeply insecure and that\u2019s your problem to deal with. also the fact you tried to point out that she\u2019s a cardiologist and not an ob as if you know anything about medicine is embarrassing", "The vibe of this makes me think YTA.  You probably just don\u2019t like her regardless of her profession.", "I'm waiting on the edit where you make up some horrible stuff she said, when you realise that nobody else agrees that talking about your career is acting like you're better than other people. YTA", "YTA - I understand your frustration. I've spent 10 years in healthcare and can attest to most doctors being arrogant. But how does blowing up at your SIL during a dinner party that you hosted help the situation? Time and a place my friend... Good luck fixing this!", "YTA. Doesn't sound like SIL was being \"arrogant,\" just answering a question from another guest.\n\nYou sound very insecure to lash out at someone like that.\n\nKudos to your sister for lightening the mood.

By your own words nothing she said sounded like bragging or putting others down.", "YTA. Just say you\u2019re jealous of her success and be done with it.", "You are apparently a jealous asshole.

You don't think she has a right to be proud of her job. \n2. You are a wee bit jealous. \n\nIt definitely reeks of jealousy, especially your comment of she was acting like it was the only job in the world because she was responding to a question about being a doctor.\n\nWhat would you have preferred her to say?
