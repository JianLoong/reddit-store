Instead of engaging the apparent sexism, you kick him out, invite his ex, which it rather kind of sounds like there might be some very good reasons he\u2019s not in that relationship\u2026.

No wonder he hates women lol.", "I mean, ESH - your sons both have concerning views on women, you massively overreacted without doing anything to tackle the actual issue, and your son's ex is kinda weird if she agreed to come in lieu of your son. \n\nHopefully your sons were just venting and realise that people are capable of being absolutely heinous to one another regardless of gender but you nuked any chance of having a constructice discussion about that so... Good job?", "ESH and this should have definitely been handled better. Inviting his ex was out of line. Simply disinviting him and/or otherwise punishing the son?
