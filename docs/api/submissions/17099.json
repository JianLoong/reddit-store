Why is this even a problem if you've already broken up with him?", "Some states make it her problem if they file taxes jointly", "I think it was more for confirmation that she wasn\u2019t an AH in this expectation. If they broke up recently, she could be experiencing doubt- was this really something worth putting her foot down over? Was separate finances really unreasonable? I don\u2019t see ages here so she could also be really young or it could be a first serious relationship- both reasons she could doubt her stance looking back.\n\nNo clue about any of that, just thinking of reasons why she would be asking the question after the relationship was over.", "But she was knowingly with this guy who did this. He became an ex after they couldn't come to terms on the financial part of her (not) contributing to his child support.

I assumed she didn't know until after he was the ex.", "Yeah, the other guy pointed that out,  it's true"]}
