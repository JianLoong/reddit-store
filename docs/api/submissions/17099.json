I packed his bags and kicked him out several months ago. We were together for about a year. Things moved ***VERY*** fast. For age reference we were both early to mid 30's.\n\nFor the comments saying I suck for being with him when there was this massive red flag - he was very manipulative and mentally abusive. The relationship destroyed who I was as a person and left me with no confidence or self worth. We are taking full on narcissist mixed with personality disorder. \"if you leave me I'll kill myself\" was one of his favourite tricks. At one point I had a mental breakdown because of the stuff he was putting me through. It has taken me several months to get back to myself but I now look back and victim blame myself and wonder if I was being unreasonable. This is apparently a common thing with victims of any sort of abuse. Deep down I know the issues were all him, but part of me still needs that confirmation from other people.", "created_utc": 1683931551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fzkwh/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_exs_kids/", "score": 400, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
