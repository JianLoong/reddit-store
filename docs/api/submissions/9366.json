An adult woman who can make her own decisions about when and who she dates?\n\n>and her husband was very clear with wanting to move on.\n\nI think you're misinterpreting here.  Her husband didn't want her to just shack up with a guy.  It wasn't a request for her to move on, it was permission to let him go if she found someone. \n\n>I told her that she's my sister, and I'm just looking out for her. \n\nDoesn't seem like you're looking out for her.

Mind your own fucking business and try to have some empathy. What is wrong with you?", "YTA. She's right, mind your own business.  Just because her husband said he wanted her to move on doesn't mean she has to do it right now.  She can still do it on her timeline, or not at all if that's what she chooses.  The man's dead, in reality his last wishes don't really mean anything.  The fact that you are using her dead husband to try to guilt her into doing things on your timetable is, quite frankly, disgusting.  You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA, mind your own damn business and for the love of all that is holy, don't ever invoke someone's dead spouse to bolster an argument, that's just plain wrong.", "YTA---- HEALING IS NOT LINEAR", "Yta. Who are you to decide when its time for her to move on from losing her HUSBAND??", "YTA yeah. Last wishes are fine and all but you can\u2019t expect her to put herself into situations she\u2019s not emotionally ready for. You sound like you\u2019re being a bossy little busy bee. Nice to try to help, but you know now she doesn\u2019t want it. Back off.", "How dare you say something so heartless to your own sister? Everyone grieves differently and obviously she isn\u2019t ready to date.

First because it\u2019s none of your business. But also, You\u2019re looking at this from the wrong perspective. She may or may not be ready to move on, but you are equating moving on with mindlessly, constantly dating anyone you suggest. You also assume that being happy equates with being in a relationship. Wrong on both counts. You can move on and be happy without a man.", "Wow, most obvious YTA I\u2019ve seen in a while. \n\nYour sister is right; it isn\u2019t your business. It wouldn\u2019t be your business if her husband hadn\u2019t died. But the fact that he died, and you tried to weaponize his memory against her, is next level assholery. And for what?

Everyone moves on at their own speed.  And honestly if her final decision IS to stay single, then there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nI've stayed single for years after a relationship before, and they weren't even ones that ended in death.  Sometimes you just have to take the time you need to process and get comfortable in your own skin/life again to be able to welcome anyone else into it with you.\n\nLay off your sister.  Everyone can't just \"move on\" at the drop of a hat.", "YTA\n\nYour comments were cruel and possibly counterproductive. \n\nIf and when your sister feels moved to get close to someone, she will.

He also said something amazingly upsetting and disgusting.\n\nOP, I wouldn't hold my breath while waiting for her to call back.", "YTA. I didn\u2019t realize dating = living life to the fullest. Pay attention to your own damn life. Let her live her life the way she wants.", "WTF is wrong with you?  YTA.  She doesn\u2019t need someone to complete her life.

Her grief isn't about you.

And she's either not ready to date or she hasn't found the right person! \n\nIt really boggles my mind how people think you can only be happy in a relationship. That is not true. \n\nLeave your sister alone. If she finds someone new to date, great, but it is not your business to get her to date. It's all very well and good to say \"but your husband wanted you to\", but he probably didn't want her to get into a relationship with any tom dick or harry just for the sake of being in a relationship, which is what you are trying to have her do!", "YTA. Butt the hell out of her life. You said something insanely cruel to her and you'll be lucky if she talks to you again.", "YTA. Wtf. Her late husband giving her his blessing to move on isn't the same as saying she absolutely has to--her own wants be damned.\n\nAlso, \"she's doing herself no favors being single\"? Uh.

Stop setting up dates for people who don\u2019t want to date.", "YTA, through and through. The whole \"she isn't doing herself any favors by being single\" is utter BS.  Not everyone needs to be in a relationship to have a full and complete life. Stop trying to dictate what \"moving on\" for her should be. And ultimately, she is right:  it is none of your business.", "YTA. It's one thing to encourage her to travel, to learn a new skill or sport or try things that will introduce her to new people who don't remember her as someone's spouse but simply see her as an individual.

Downright terrible.", "Info are you serious ?", "YTA. Some people want to move on and others have met the love of their life so are happy to continue without a partner.

What is so concerning with her livening her life how she feels right? And most importantly, wtf?", "YTA. And a shit sibling. How dare you use her dead husband  against her? And since when is having a romantic partner the be all and end all of life life. There's a whole, big world out there that has nothing to do with partnering up.

Jesus fucking christ, please leave this poor woman alone. She's allowed to grieve however she wants for however long she wants.

People need as much time as they need, and that mean Never for your sister.  How dare you think you know what's better for her than she does and how dare you attempt to speak for her dead husband.   Her husband may have wanted to not feel chained to his memory and free to find love, but he certainly wouldn't want it forced on her, either.  And if he doesn't want to control her from the grave, he would certainly not want you doing it to her in life.  This is not your ballgame.", "YTA you are her sister, not her husband and are certainly incompetent to speak for him.

I really, really put myself out there, online dating, meeting through friends, work, shared hobbies, going out a few nights a week. I dated a lot and most of my dates were flops or pretty short term situationships. For six years.\n\nDating is tough under the best circumstances. After losing her husband, your sister is not only dealing with the grief and trying to move on, but also learning how to date again. That shit is hard, especially if she isn't meeting people she connects with. \n\nIf her husband loved and and wanted the best for her, I have no doubt he'd feel compassion and maybe worry for her. But shame? No. That's not loving. It's very cruel that you said that. You're twisting his memory. He wanted her to be happy, not just to date randos to please the people around her. If you care about your sister, it's one thing worry and encourage her. It's another to shame and pressure her to behave how you want her to. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with taking time to heal or holding out for someone she really wants to be with instead of forcing herself to date just to \"move on.\"  There's nothing wrong with being alone.

Maybe she just needs some time to herself to figure out how to deal and process this loss, what she is looking for in her future, reflecting on the path she wants to take moving forward, trying out new hobbies and just generally figuring out who she is without her husband but her side? I honestly think that would be a way healthier approach than just to say \"I'm moving on now\" and blindly date the next best available time.

I\u2019m sure your sister is in a constant battle with herself all day long, in terms of still grieving her husband but also wanting to move on and not being emotionally ready to. I understand your intention wasn\u2019t totally coming from a bad place, you want your sister to be happy. But like many people on here said, grief takes time. \n\nYour sister has a right to grieve for however long she needs.

Of course, if she goes no contact with you, don't be surprised.", "YTA\n\nNo, her late husband would be ashamed of you for thinking you have the right to dictate how she lives HER life.

You just need to realign what you think is best to be a bit closer with what she tells you she needs. In this situation YTA, but I don't think you're actually an asshole, I think you're just missing the mark and you don't understand. \n\nThat being said, never speak of the dead like that.

I think you have good intentions, but your actions and words are SOOOO wrong.\n\nIt is absolutely NEVER ok to shame someone for being unable to get over past trauma, she was clearly very in love with her husband. Also, you are mistaken, trying to push her to get a partner WILL NOT help her get a partner or feel less guilty, you're just making her feel worse, and wrong, and stupid for thinking like she does. And what this is teaching her is that you are definitely not the person she wants to confide in. Instead of asking her how she was doing, helping her through the trauma, you are trying to force her to get over it. Absolutely not ok. \n\nEveryone goes through things at different speeds, recovery isn't linear. What you SHOULD do is stop trying to force her to get a partner and instead help her go to therapy so that she can safely and gradually accept the situation, come to terms with the truth and forgive herself. After she has healed enough, she might want to find another partner, or she might not. She is under no obligation to grant her late husband's wish because this is her life, not his, not yours, nor anyone else. She can carry an absolutely, most fulfilling life, without another romantic partner. Also, don't EXPECT her to fully heal, she might never, and that's ok.\n\nPlease be kind to her, she really needs it.

Before he died he was very clear that he wanted her to move on and be happy, instead of wasting the rest of her life as a single widow. My sister promised him to try, and did to some extent.\n\nAbout 6 months after my BIL died, she started trying to date, but found it really hard. I tried gently to explain to her that it was alright to move on, and that she wasn't \"betraying\" anybody, but she never went beyond any first dates with guys she saw for the next few months.\n\nAfter that she stopped for about 3 years, which was really concerning. I tried to set her up with some guys I knew, but that never went anywhere. Than about a month ago she was seeing this really nice guy, but she broke it off after 3 dates since she \"didn't feel right\"\n\nI asked her why she was being like this, at this point its been plenty of time to move on, and she isn't doing herself any favors by being single, and her husband was very clear with wanting to move on. She said that she just \"felt uncomfortable\" dating again, to which I said she had no reason to.\n\nAt this point she got pissed at me, and told me to mind my business. I told her that she's my sister, and I'm just looking out for her. I also told her she was disrespecting her late husband's memories, and that he would probably be ashamed at her for not living her life to the fullest. She left and hasn't spoken to me since.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not only the loss I had to get over. It was the full time caring, and then loss of what I have been doing 24h a day for months. It was the time I spent watching as the person I admired and loved lost health, strength, autonomy, and life. It was the renewed trauma each time I had to remove his name from our car ownership, our joint accounts, our appliances. It\u2019s a lot. \n\nAfter that, everything around me was gray and plain for a long time. Trying to date wasn\u2019t something I felt guily about, it had nothing to do with not wanting to betray my late partner, as many around me assumed or accused me to. It was just bland. \n\nIt was like going through the motion of dating or being social and waiting for it to kick in and become real. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about what a new person was saying. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care if they called or texted, if they liked me, or even what activity we could do. I was just going through the motions. Dates felt like a waste of time and energy, no matter who it was with. And because I couldn\u2019t stand to see someone trying to get attached to me as I was unable to care, I would put a stop to relationship attempts so that they didn\u2019t waste their time on me.

People asking us if \"we would hate kids forever\" and being angry that we weren't always able to be around young kids. We lost a lot of friends who refused to acknowledge and respect our loss.
