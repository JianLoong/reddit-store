It's heartbreaking not only for you but for your children. We urge you to go to therapy for yourself as well as marriage counseling. We love you and your kids and we'll be here for you if you ever need us but from now on, until further notice, he's not welcome in our home.\"", "NTA - why waste the energy and space having him there.  It just makes them feel you're supporting his lifestyle since it's obvious your sister is.", "This plan might backfire and result in seeing less of your sister and niece/nephew.", "NTA. Your house - you get to decide who is welcome there.", "I'm going to say NTA because I think you're right. However, excluding him is going to drive a major wedge between you and your sister, which could seriously damage the relationship. It's going to also be tough on their kids. How do you explain why Dad can't come to the family bbq? If I was in your position I personally would allow him to come around and grin and bear it. Nothing you do will convince your sister to leave. It's unfortunate, but it's her life and her family and her choice. Again, NTA, but banning him from your house will likely do more harm than good. It's a tough situation and I wish you all (except cheating BIL) the best.", "NTA - but tbh i dont think will have the impact you want", "NTA because it's your house and you get to decide who comes in.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that this could easily have the opposite effect than what you intend. If her husband can't go to your house, likely your sister and her kids will be there less too. She probably won't experience this as a show of support, even if that's what you intended.\n\nThe message that your sister will receive will probably be that you don't support her decisions or trust her ability to make her own choices about her relationship, and if this causes a rift between you, it could make it less likely for her to eventually leave her cheating husband because she won't feel like she has any place to run to.", "NTA, it sucks that it is driving a wedge, but I personally wouldn't want someone like that around my family. Also, i would have a hard time not saying something, so it'd be better for that person in the long run to not be around!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you decide to leave your abusive marriage, call me first, but I can\u2019t be around him. He hates you and I can\u2019t watch it anymore.\u201d \n\nNTA- you don\u2019t need to sacrifice yourself or your family for him. Give her the numbers to domestic violence hotlines, local divorce attorneys, and therapists and walk away. \n\nY\u2019all are enabling her at this point. She\u2019s making decisions that are dangerous for her kids and y\u2019all are stepping in to pick up the pieces.", "NTA, but this is a tough on OP. You might want to evaluate whether this course of action is worth it.", "Just because she\u2019s willing to forgive forget and keep her relationship with him it doesn\u2019t require you to  you don\u2019t need him in your home NTA\n\nJust like you can love somebody whose toxic it die mean you have to have them in your life you can live from afar", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation, and I went out of my way to meet my person for things like lunch mid-week, and coffee right after work. Snippets of time where I could be there for them, but avoid the circus monkey in the background. I also steadfastly avoided all conversation surrounding the person I was avoiding by redirecting the conversation, sometimes repeatedly. In the long-term, it saved our relationship, and I was able to provide needed support eventually. If I'd continued exposing myself to the circus, I'd have eventually gone NC with both people.", "NTA but you're definitely going to drive them closer together. She will stop confiding in you what she's going through with him. Even if you say you're still there for her, she will see you as someone who isn't. This will fuel his angle of \"nobody cares for you except me\" and \"us vs the world\" mentality. The BEST thing you can do for someone in an abusive relationship or infidelity is love them and help them navigate when they come to you. What they do with your advice is up to them. You can say he can't come in your home but you will not see your nieces/nephew and she will be more at risk to stay, not leave. If nobody in your home is at risk from the affect of this guy, I'd let them still come BUT you have every right not to want him in your home", "NTA. What a way for them to show their kids what a relationship can look like, depending on how old they are. Kids can be very perceptive. \n\n\nI\u2019d love to be petty and gutsy in this situation where any time they come over after you try to invite just your sister and her kids, you ask the husband \u201chow\u2019s your dating life been going? Bang any hotties recently?\u201d (Obviously not in front of the kids). \n\n\nIf she\u2019s going to share all of that dirt and not stand up for herself every single time, might as well treat it as common knowledge and not something with consequences since that\u2019s what she\u2019s allowing it to be.", "NTA. Tbh, I am kinda disappointed in the fact that it took ANY of you this long to say that. Like, you should have said this after round one.", "NTA, you sister may forgive him, doesn't mean you want him in your house.  But if he stays home from your family visits, he is probably just going to find someone else to sleep with while he is \"idle\"", "Mild YTA.  it\u2019s between your sister and husband. You want to see her and kids you will just have to put up with the husband.  But tell your sister no more.  Don\u2019t tell us anything about his cheating", "NTA, she has chosen to stay married to the man for whatever reason", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want him in my house either.", "This is exactly why we didn\u2019t do this before, we originally uninvited him to our house last Christmas but then my sister wasn\u2019t going to come to our dinner. I ultimately decided to allow him over because I felt the only people being punished for his actions are my sister and the kids.", "Excellent comment. The fallout from banishment would only muddy the waters morally and enable her to implausibly see her husband as the victim - a convenient way for her to deflect her own attention from his constant betrayals and why she tolerates them. Banishing him could paradoxically drive them closer together. Maybe you could use the credible threat of banishment as leverage to get her info solo therapy to explore why she tolerates this. A capable therapist could help her discover that she deserves better. Couples therapy will only give your BIL a voice to manipulate and would distract attention from the fundamental issue, which is why your sister tolerates this. Of course NTA, but I think banishing him is an emotional response, which will isolate your sister and enhance BIL's control.", "Tbh, I'd invite, and make sure he subtly feels the lack of familial welcome, as if he's a brand new boyfriend that nobody really knows. No outright hostility, but just let his presence roll off of your back. She's family, her children are family, he's just a come-along.", "It's important OP is there for his sister but it's also ok to get off the Rollercoaster ride. \n\nThere comes a point at which watching someone you care about get hurt over and over again, watching her go back for more over and over, seeking your support over and over becomes too much. \n\nOP can love his sister, offer to be there for her when she's ready but also be unwilling to continue to have a front row seat.", "Sometimes, in those situations, everyone is his enabler. He's behaving badly but no one does anything about it! He continues to be invited and everyone acts like total hypocrites. It often ends up with no one wanting be around the person, forcing the spouse to finally realize that it's not the family who has a problem, it's the person they're married to.", "Tell her to stop confiding in you. It just makes things awkward.", "My father in law had a long term girlfriend.   Like 30+ years they were together.   She had a daughter.   The daughter's husband cheated once.  My FIL grabbed the guy by the throat.   Said if they were ever that close again he would beat him senseless.   He also told him that if his daughter doesn't continue to come see her grandma as much or more than before he got caught cheating he would hospitalize him. \n\nSo he stayed home at holidays.   My FIL was very intimidating.", "YTA", "NTA. Just tell her you aren\u2019t comfortable with a serial lair in your home.", "Let him come over but make pointed comments about cheating etc. Belittle and shame him. Not in front of his kids but whenever you can. Do it with humour or malice. But do it.", "NTA, but your sister is dumb to keep involving you in her marital drama (then expecting you to ignore it).", "YTA: it's or house you can do what you want. Still\nIt's not your relationship to inject so heavily into. They have kids. Cheating or not children do better with the father in the home.", "NTA", "My family did that with my aunt and her cheating creep of a husband. Fortunatly he screwed himself over trading drugs for sex as a licensed doctor and is looking at 200+ years in jail for it he was just convicted on 14 counts. \n\nUnfortunately Aunt still seems to defend him. After years of cheating (once with her best friend) and literally molesting his unwilling patients and she is still standing by him and is upset that the siblings are \"rubbing it in her face\" by offering housing and help when he goes to jail (assuming she leaves him)", "But like\u2026your sister is doing this. \n\nIf she wants to play the dutiful wife who turns a blind eye to her husband\u2019s philandering, the key is to *be blind*. Which does not involve running to her family with each new tale of his betrayals. \n\nIf she wants her family to rally around her, she needs to give you some reason to believe that your rallying serves a *purpose*, and isn\u2019t an exercise in futility. You are not Sisyphus, you are not required to keep pushing the rock up the hill indefinitely. Eventually you\u2019ll start to wonder what difference it makes whether you offer her tea and sympathy or not. \n\nShe is trying to have it both ways, and that\u2019s not sustainable.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't want such a person at my house for the same reason. I wouldn't respect a person that's clearly not respecting my sister.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister likes it that way, she just wants to vent. Exluding your BIL will just make you lose the relationship with your sister.", "NTA can\u2019t blame you", "NTA OP.  I think you should go no contact with both of them for awhile.  She seems to be playing with fire every time she goes back to him, and if she doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries about him not being welcome in your home, then she needs to be cut off from you.", "YTA you don\u00b4t have to respect him but you should respect her decision to remain married to him. He\u00b4s not cheating on you or infront of you is he? Maybe you should get of your high hourse and be there for your sister no matter what she desides in her own private affairs", "NTA but you probably only drive her to stay with him. You stay with a cheater because you don't feel you deserve better or because you have low self esteem. If she doesn't leave him for cheating she's not going to leave him because he's not allowed in your house, you'll just isolate her and make her more dependent on him. It's your house so you're not an AH for not letting him there but think about what your end goal is.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is in abusive relationship. Those people either never leave or leave and go back like 10x. \n\nStand your ground, let the chips fall where they may. Your sister is CHOOSING to stay, so let her lie in the bed she made.", "YTA YTA YTA. Its not your business what happens in another couples relationship. He did not cheat on you. Get over this.  If your sister wants to still be in a relationship with him accept that and include him. Again his cheat DOSE NOT IMPACT YOU BECUASE ITS NOT YOUR MARRIAGE.", "NTA, but I think you should just let him come over. She is clearly very ok with his cheating and doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it. If that\u2019s how she wants her relationship to be, then I think at this point that\u2019s her business. I think you need to keep open contact and relations with your sister and your niece and nephew. And keep your door open for when she smartens up. \n\nIn this case, I think it\u2019s better to have them closer so you can keep an eye on things, rather than to just cut him off entirely, and isolate your sister in the process.", "Violence is not the answer, that\u2019s awful.", "You mean allow him to come over and then grey rock him? Not a bad idea.", "The emotional setting you are looking for is Cool.  Or maybe Chilly.  It isn't wanting to be anything you can't backtrack from if the POS does actually manage to keep it in his pants.\n\nIn short, say hello, how are you, and then excuse yourself with something you **absolutely** have to be doing **right then**, and then play dodge'em the rest of the time until it's Oh, you're leaving, hope you had a great time, see you next family function.", "This 100% She tells OP about his infidelity and shares the burden of her pain with her family yet expects them to change tack, drop their anger at her shitty husband and continue as normal. This is not a realistic expectation.", "They can have Fatal Attraction and similar movies on the tv haha", "NTA ban them all. Your sister is an enabler and likes being cheated on. Ban her.", "It's hard to say without more information about the impact on you.  Assuming that she is hurt by the cheating and expects you to support her through it, again and again, then NTA. \n\nMay I suggest that you consider excluding her, too, for a time?  This isn't a perfect analogy, but she keeps allowing the bull in the china shop,  watching it break everything, expecting you to dry her tears and help her clean up the shop after everything is broken, and then expecting you to be cordial to the bull.  Over and over again.  Excluding the bull will partly solve the problem, but maybe you also need to exclude her, too, until she stops letting the bull back in.", "You\u2019re definitely right that the sister shouldn\u2019t be telling you\u2026she apparently keeps forgiving him, but you understandably have a harder time with that. I\u2019d tell her that in no uncertain terms. You don\u2019t have sexual or emotional connection with the B-I-L that makes it possible for her to keep forgiving him. I don\u2019t see how you ever spend a holiday with her and the kids without letting him come as well, though", "Cut contact until the next time he cheats and she needs a shoulder to cry on.", "I don\u2019t disagree that it is none of my business, but I do agree with most people on here that she should stop confiding in us if she doesn\u2019t want us to feel some type of way about it. To be honest I would love nothing more then to never hear about it again. It\u2019s her choice to stay married not mine.", "To your sister: \"Look, if you don't talk about the cheating with <husband>, then you could at least have the same courtesy with us.\"", "Go lo contact with your sister . She likes being cheated on.", "Also, bragging about crimes is a bad idea.", "Then it's time to decide whether you can continue being emotional support to your sister.  I think whether or not you're the asshole here is irrelevant in the face of the importance of the underlying issues.  This asshole hurts your sister.  It is painful to pretend to not hate his guts at family events because of that.  It is painful to your sister to not go to said events with this asshole.  Perhaps because it pierces the veil of the pretending everything is fine now zone.  Perhaps it's some other reason.\n\nThat's kind of small fry peripheral stuff compared to the root issue, which is that you justifiably expect this asshole to continue to hurt your sister, you also expect her to choose not to protect herself, and that her continuing to do so while being emotionally close to you will hurt you.  I'd suggest what matters here is two things:\n\n1. Tell your sister that it hurts you and your family when she gets hurt by this asshole.  Tell her that you can't be there to help pick up the pieces forever if she intends to keep getting hurt forever.  \n2. Decide where your limit is.  It may well already have been passed, but don't be emotional support to your sister if you don't have the pain threshold to keep doing it.", "This is so petty but honestly this guy deserves it."]}
