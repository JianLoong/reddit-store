I remember Terry trying to take me from my own mother by putting me in his car and driving off. When he would take me in on weekends, I would be very neglected. Recently, Terry has been trying to get into contact with me. He found my Twitter and tried to message me, he was blocked and I deactivated my Twitter. I found his instagram and blocked him there. A year later, he found my TikTok. He tried commenting on my videos. I blocked him, hoping he'd take the hint.

And a brother K2 (3) he doesn\u2019t know about you yet. I also suffer from anxiety. I hope you are well and your mum is too.

If you or K wish to talk to me, I\u2019m sure my mum will arrange something if you reach out to her. You know her email, her FaceBook, her number, etc. You know where my grandma lives too. I\u2019m sorry but you chose to move on and have another family. You can not use your children into guilting me to not block you, I have never met these kids, nor do I really care about them. Maybe take the damn hint that I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now? You\u2019re not my dad. My name isn\u2019t even LN anymore so stop calling me it. I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t be a good older sister to K and K2. I remember what you did. Now please, I wish you peace. Please leave me alone.

That's why he put her in the car and drove away.  OP doesn't explain how Mom got her back - court order maybe?  Then Dad is depressed at the situation, maybe Mom got stifling child support awarded and he worked a low-paying job that meant he had to take all the overtime he could get.

By the time the weekend and visitation rolled around, he was exhausted and unable to be the fun parent, leading OP to feel neglected.  \n\nI think OP is not telling the whole story here.

My mother gave me the option when he found my Twitter and I said no", "Haha thank you - I think it\u2019s my autism that makes me talk quite \u201cmm fancy\u201d lol", "Aw thank you so much - here\u2019s one too \ud83c\udfc6", "I totally understand your point. Your friend may be more sensitive to the phrasing. I assume if you would not want any harm to happen to the eight and three year old. You just don\u2019t want a relationship with them.", "Oh no, I would never want them to be harmed - but as you said, I just don\u2019t care enough to have a relationship with them", "If the topic comes up again with your friend, you may want to emphasize the you don\u2019t wish any I\u2019ll will towards the kids. You don\u2019t want a relationship with them because your father would have to be involved", "NTA. Your friend is right, people can change. That still doesn\u2019t mean their victims have to be around them.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with telling him you don\u2019t care about his new kids. You didn\u2019t say you wished them harm, just that they don\u2019t rank in your priorities. I \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about some random kid in the supermarket, in the sense that they are not my priority or responsibility. And that\u2019s fine! \n\nI\u2019m really proud of you for having the maturity to recognize that he was trying to manipulate you with the children. This is a man who refuses to take no for an answer - how does your friend know he\u2019s even telling the truth about these kids? And \u201cI also suffer from anxiety,\u201d just smacks of \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019ve been told about me but maybe you\u2019ll ignore it now.\u201d \n\nFriends and family often like to tell victims what they should and shouldn\u2019t do, but you should never do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable with in this situation.", "Everyone here is TA. However OP, you are valid in your stance and congrats on your continued success.", "Get a new friend.  She doesn\u2019t have your back.  Trust your own intuition about what makes you comfortable.  You don\u2019t owe this man or these children anything.\n\nNTA.  Take care.", "NTA\n\nNot one apology for his actions toward you or your mother. \n\nSend your message.", "NTA\n\nJust because your sperm donor has changed he didn't change for you and therein lies the problem. He neglects you when he has you and mistreats you then blames you and tells you that he doesn't remember any of that happening. \n\nOf course. \n\nHe then went and created a new family that he now wants you to meet because he told them this fantasy about an older sister they, and apparently he, never knew.\n\nYOU. OWE. HIM. NOTHING.", "I see no apology in his email. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nDon't take advice from people who don't have to live with the consequences.\n\nYou \"friend\" has no horse in this race, so their opinion is immaterial.\n\nYou did great, keep doing you.", "You've seen all the records proving your mother's claims? Wow. They call that parental alienation. If you can't figure that on your own then I support your decision to stay away from those kids.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why your friend blew up on you for not knowing your siblings. They\u2019re fine, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to have a worse life just because they don\u2019t know their half sister. Like zero x one is still zero.", "NTA.\n\nYou're baby-sitter age.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's why your father suddenly contacted you.", "NTA.  He's been out of your life for 13 years.  He has not been a parent to you.  Therefore his children, whom you have never met, are not siblings to you.  He wants something from you and I'm pretty sure you don't want to be involved in whatever that happens to be.", "Maybe that maybe this just shut up you delusional", "Those kids are OP sperm donor children, not OP siblings. \nOP don't let shitty people guilt trip you, if you don't want a relationship with an abuser and his children you don't have to do it.\nPlease stay safe and talk with someone you trust about it. NTA", "NTA. People change in general aspects of their lives however those who are abusive NEVER change and shouldn\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA and drop the friend OP they\u2019re not a good one.", ">I told one of my friends my reply and she blew up on me, calling me an asshole for saying I don't care about my siblings and that I should give Terry another chance. I explained what happened in the past and she told me that people can change, despite the fact that I mentioned that he was domestically abusive towards my mother and neglectful towards me. She said it doesn't matter and that I should give them a chance. I still refuse to as these kids aren't my concern as I haven't ever met them.\n\n1) She has some nerve blowing up on you over something that doesn't even impact you. 2) She probably has a happy go lucky family life and is incapable of basic empathy in this regard with a pro-family outlook 3) You have every right to write him off. He may have had kids, but as far as you're concerned you didn't have a father past age 4, and therefore you don't have siblings you just have a blood connection who had kids semi-recently which anyone can claim surrounding distant relations.\n\nNTA", "You have the right to decide who you want in your life. Change or not, siblings or not, it\u2019s your choice. Creating boundaries and enforcing them doesn\u2019t make you an AH or a bad person.", "NTA.  I would have twisted the knife though a bit more in the response to him though, but that\u2019s just me.", "Easy solution get rid of the \"friend\" and continue to ignore him. My NTA", ">Also, there\u2019s a real chance your friend has been abused or will be with that type of mentality, unfortunately.\n\nOr they're yet another pro-family sort whose mother and father are the ideal couple, their grandparents are cheek pinchingly cute and sweet, and all their aunts and uncles are glowingly inviting people. It happens more often than not in my opinion that the people most likely to say, \"family is everything\" are either people who've never had it hard in any fashion that deserves the description when it comes to family, or they're that sad sort who has, but they've yet to reach the point where they realize their energy directed at family is just a desperate cry for a return of what they're putting in.", "It\u2019s hilarious that you\u2019re jumping through hoops to justify abuse, you\u2019re a clown and should be ashamed of yourself, be better.", "Your experience is not OPs experience, and frankly your condescending attitude does you no favors and will gain you no support for this rediculous take.\n\nYou having a grandchild has no bearing on OPs life experiences, and honestly it seems like you mentioned it only to try to show some false sense of superiority. It obviously didn't work out for you.", "I mean, why would they care? Do you care about some second cousin you've never met or heard the name of? That may not be the blood connection OP has to their siblings, but they've never met them and as connecting with them requires facilitating a connection to her estranged father there's no real reason to forge one. OP doesn't wish ill upon them, they just don't know them any more than they know some random dude on the other end of town.\n\nBeing indifferent is not the same as wishing badly of someone, and it's not a crime.", "Stfu you clown, touch some grass", "Same here to be fair", "They being half siblings and OP in later life becomes a cougar and the brother and her get together they cannot marry in the US.", "Your friend is just blind to the reality of the real world. They are not bad for it, just lucky I guess. Some people just can't comprehend what struggles people have gone through because they view life through only their experience and reject that anything else can be the norm. If they keep pushing then they will be the AH."]}
