All I knew about him was from my mother. My mum told me that my dad, we'll call Terry, was Domestically Abusive towards her, which is one of the reasons we had to leave. I remember Terry trying to take me from my own mother by putting me in his car and driving off. When he would take me in on weekends, I would be very neglected. Recently, Terry has been trying to get into contact with me. He found my Twitter and tried to message me, he was blocked and I deactivated my Twitter. I found his instagram and blocked him there. A year later, he found my TikTok. He tried commenting on my videos. I blocked him, hoping he'd take the hint. My merch page is connected to my TikTok so that followers can buy my work (I'm an artist in my spare time). He had followed my link and sent me a text. \n\nIt read:\n\nHi Anon0520. I know you probably don\u2019t want talk to me but I thought you should know a bit about me. I\u2019m now living in - you have a sister K (8) who is so desperate to talk to you. And a brother K2 (3) he doesn\u2019t know about you yet. I also suffer from anxiety. I hope you are well and your mum is too. I\u2019ve never stopped thinking about you I see that you like dancing and music. I hope you do read this and not block me you can ask me anything? Love Terry K K2 xxx\n\nAfter reading the message, I wasn't sure how to react. I was upset, angry, and confused. I let my mum know as I usually do, and she told me to block him. You can not block people on the site I have been using.\n\nWhat bothered me is that he knew I want nothing to do with him and knows I've been blocking him.\n\nMy reply:\n\nThis is inappropriate. If you or K wish to talk to me, I\u2019m sure my mum will arrange something if you reach out to her. You know her email, her FaceBook, her number, etc. You know where my grandma lives too. I\u2019m sorry but you chose to move on and have another family. You can not use your children into guilting me to not block you, I have never met these kids, nor do I really care about them. Maybe take the damn hint that I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now? You\u2019re not my dad. My name isn\u2019t even LN anymore so stop calling me it. I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t be a good older sister to K and K2. I remember what you did. Now please, I wish you peace. Please leave me alone. As I said, you have my mums details if you wish to talk. Thanks for your efforts. I hope you get peace of mind soon knowing that I'm safe, happy, and have a good future ahead. From Anon0520.\n\nI told one of my friends my reply and she blew up on me, calling me an asshole for saying I don't care about my siblings and that I should give Terry another chance. I explained what happened in the past and she told me that people can change, despite the fact that I mentioned that he was domestically abusive towards my mother and neglectful towards me. She said it doesn't matter and that I should give them a chance. I still refuse to as these kids aren't my concern as I haven't ever met them.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1682764090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132pegf/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_i_dont_care_about_my/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No need to forgive or accept. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Even if he changed, that does nothing to repair the damage he caused. You owe him nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou have a right to your feelings.   \nTell your friend that some abusers never change until they end up bashing their spouses to death.", "NTA. Your friend is reacting from her own issues, it sounds like. You don\u2019t owe them anything, and your father\u2019s pushiness is not a good sign in light of his past behavior.", "NTA. You did right. You want nothing to do with him or his kids. As your friend say's people change. But that doesn't mean they get a free pass to walk into your life. Like they've done nothing. Your choice not to deal with him.", "NTA. While I do think your Dad (feels wrong to use that word) does have the right to reach out and attempt contant to explain he has changed and wants to try and reconnect. It is 100% your right to block him or ignore any attempt to contact you.\n\nAfter a long period of trying and failing to contact you he used the fact you have half siblings as a guilty trip... that puts him on AH territory.\n\nYou were reasonable and polite and honestly only said all of this after he failed to take the hint. Good on you OP", "NTA.  Lose the friend", "NTA. You were civil and polite when you even didn\u2019t have to be. Good for you, live your life as you want it, you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA. \n\nClear as day that even if this man *has* changed in a positive direction towards being a better person, he hasn't stopped being a shade of that person. His attitude is still the same - he is still happy to ignore your clear signals you want nothing to do with him and to try to guilt trip you with his mental health and his kids. \n\nEven if that wasn't the case, him changing would not negate what he put you and your mum through. You feel how you feel and you don't owe him anything. He has to move at your pace. He can make it easy for you to reach out to him but he has to back off, and if he can't do that you already have your answer.", "NTA. I hear what your friend is saying and maybe one day you will want to have a relationship with your dad or half-siblings, but that doesn\u2019t have to be today or ever. I think you were actually quite mature in your response to your father and absolutely not TA at all.", "NTA\n\nPeople can change, sure, it doesn't mean you have to grant them a place in your life. You do not owe peace to people who abused and neglected you. Good on you for finding it in your heart to wish him peace though, but you're not obligated to absolve him of his wrongdoings. You're well within your rights to ignore the man from now on.", "Nta your friend has an unhealthy mindset. You did things the right way, don't let strangers make you feel like you /owe/ them for the bed they made.", "You're NTA. Your response was mature, well thought out, and 100% appropriate. Your friend needs to check her judgmental attitude and butt out. Terry sounds like he is using his own children to shoehorn himself back into your life. That is much worse than you saying no to his tactics.", "NTA, you don't owe him or his kids anything including a relationship. Your friend is also awful for not supporting you. they are not a true friend if they think you should betray yourself for a negligent parent. He may be looking for a caretaker/babysitter beware. Also if he's disregarding your boundaries by harassing you online, then he definitely has not changed. Please don't listen to your friend's bad advice.", "NTA. You owe that man **nothing**. You were correct in your deduction that he is using his children to manipulate and guilt you into having contact with him. Why is he telling an 8 y/o about a child he hasn\u2019t really been involved with. Seems fishy to me. \n\nYour friend also sucks. Maybe there\u2019s some underlying issues there, but she has no right to tell you to be involved with your father. It\u2019s your choice entirely. It\u2019s your life. And good for you for setting boundaries, and being respectful to Terry even when he didn\u2019t really deserve it.", "NTA Even if you can't block people on that site, you can block his number. You NEVER owe abusers a second chance, especially ones who don't apologize but act like you owe them.", "NTA & drop that friend", "NTA. You owe him nothing. He should have learned the lessen that you don't want to speak to him. He's not respecting you by insisting. He did not changed or not enough imo.\n\nDrop it. Your reply is very mature.", "NTA and I wouldn't be surprised if Terry expects you to provide free babysitting. Anxiety is not an excuse for abuse. He didn't even apologize for how he treated you and your mother and that right there is proof that he hasn't changed.  Your friend is wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As someone who also has a shitty father, I found that a lot of people told me I was supposed to make up for his behaviour just like your father and your friend are asking you to. Those people always turned out to have their own baggage. In my uncles case it was because he was terrified his own kids would cut him off for his shitty behaviour.
