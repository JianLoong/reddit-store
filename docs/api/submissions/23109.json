To me it comes across more as he purposefully dragged his feet to offer gfs unqualified sister as the perfect \"solution\" thinking op would role over to his will, so everything is his way. And now op is holding him accountable, he is having a melt down that he can't get exactly what he wants.", "Every y T a person I have seen has conveniently missed that she also suggested his parents come to help look after the kid but dad was to proud so refused, and of he had told op and started looking for a replacement when the previous nanny left, then all of this could have been avoided.", "That's fair enough, everyone is different, the reason first aid training is normally wanted (not needed) incase something happens, calling 999 often isn't enough without help before emergency services arrive. But I get your point that in theory as long as they can clean a graze and put a plaster on it should be sufficient. I was taught first aid training as a child as my sibling had health issues that meant cpr/mouth to mouth may be necessary and I was prone to fainting spells so needed to be put into recovery position incase it was something severe. But I do understand that isn't average circumstances.", "Perhaps his parents aren't able to spend 8 hours+ a day doing this, maybe they have jobs?. He found a solution, just because it wasn't perfect for her it's unacceptable?. You are separated, he is a parent too. He has just as much say/ability to determine who he allows to watch his child as his ex does. you do not get to micromanage his parenting..", "They may work and be unable to help, but the post says he didn't want to ask them because of a childcare dispute, which would make it his choice, I'm judging based on the post not every possible hypothetical scenario. And yes he is a parent as well but he will be biased towards his gfs sister, and If he doesn't like someone op suggests, he gets equal veto power."]}
