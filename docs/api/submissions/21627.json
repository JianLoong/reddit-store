That being said, I've since moved back to the US (but several states away from family) and they have realized in order to have a relationship of any sort with me, they have to respect my boundaries.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are an adult who can make your own decisions. Even with your sister, set your boundaries and hold them. If your family can't respect the boundaries you establish, cut the cord any way you like.   \n\n\nHowever, as someone who has moved for a partner, I stress having a plan in place in case you move and the relationship breaks down!", "NTA for abandoning your parents. \n\nit\u2019s good that you want to apologise to your sister. it wasn\u2019t her fault that your parents decided to snoop around your stuff", "Oh dear. Someone invading an adult's privacy to this extent--and this is a LOT even for a teen, let alone a 26-year-old-- thinks of that adult as their property.

But also be prepared for them to have a very spectacular flameout when they realize you are really leaving (and don't leave anything in their possession you ever expect to need.) \n\nThis wasn't your sister's fault. Your parents came this way. More likely your sister was rebelling because they overcontrolled her than that her behavior made them overcontrolling.

Your sister turns 18 and wants to live in dorms or move out in some way. Your parents discover you\u2019re gay some other way. Helicopter parents do NOT WANT to let go, and when their kids show signs of growing up, they go even harder. I do think blaming your move on your sister\u2019s choices as a 16 year old were an asshole thing to say to her, she\u2019s a grown adult now who has also been affected by those choices.

You\u2019re growing up & out, which is what kids are supposed to do. As long as you stay with them they will not respect your boundaries. As for your sister, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s angry because she feels guilty watching your parents hover over you!

Saving money was fine for a bit but is it really worth remaining a \u201cchild\u201d in their presence?", "Random: awesome username! Got a good laugh. \n\nI was in the same boat you\u2019re in. 14 years ago I came out to my parents. Needles to say they did not take it well. I was only 18, with no place to go. It was hard, but I had no choice but to stick it out. I start dating my (now) husband at 20, went to college, and got a good career. I still stayed \u201cclose\u201d to my parents and family, albeit I kept my private life to myself. Eventually, I started to integrate my husband with my family. As my husband and I progressed in our career and made a life for ourselves, my family started to become much more accepting of our relationship. My mom started to call my husband her \u201csecond son,\u201d and gives his kisses every time she visits (which is often). It brings my heart so much joy. I was recently told by my mom how lucky I am to have met my husband. I do want to clarify that this is not because we have good jobs, but because they realize we are going to be okay, which is what most of our parents want for us. My dad is not as vocal, but he shows his support in other ways, such as reminding me to make sure my husband is \u201cfed\u201d (food is my dad\u2019s love language). This didn\u2019t happen overnight, it took 15 years. \n\nThis is going to be an unpopular opinion. I know it\u2019s difficult to see your parent\u2019s point of view, especially when you have been hurt by them, so let me offer you some insight. As a parent, especially one from a culture that views homosexuality as a disease (like mine), or one that is deeply religious, having a gay child questions the very foundation of their existence. You probably had some time to accept your sexuality, but they haven\u2019t. It changed the life that they had imagined for their child. My parents said and did horrible things. I don\u2019t tell people because I don\u2019t want them to judge my parents based on their actions when they were hurt. It took me years to realize that the actions my parents took, they did it out of love and concern, however misguided it may have been. The journey you have had to make in private is a difficult one. You were probably scared of the future, not knowing what it will be like. Your parents are still there, they are afraid of what the future holds for you and that fear can manifest in hurtful ways. Your parents may believe that if you stayed single (or worse marry a woman), life will somehow be easier for you. I am sure they realize that life will be harder for you as a gay man, but what they may not realize is that they are contributing to that. Offer them some grace, if not for them then for your own sake and ease of mind. I do not advocate maintaining relationships with toxic people. So, ask yourself if you believe your parents are doing this out of *misguided* love, or if they truly want you to be miserable and alone forever. Depending on the answer, by all means cut them out or go low contact, you are most certainly entitled to that. 10 years ago, I did consider this option. I am glad I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t imagine my life now without my parents. I get to share all my successes with them, all my life milestones. But, I also realize that I do not live in a fairytale, and just because my family came around, it doesn\u2019t mean yours will too. I just wanted to offer you my experience. I hope this helps, and if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m still sending you virtual hugs anyways \ud83e\udd70", "NTA for wanting to move away from overbearing parents, but you owe your sister one heck of an apology for saying that their behaviour now is somehow her fault for a pretty normal thing she did as a 16 year old.", "NTA\n\nLeave.

That being said, you\u2019re NTA for wanting to put some space between you and your parents.", "NTA \n\nIts not your sisters fault though, there is every likelihood they were like that before.\nAll her sneaking out did was to make it more obvious.\n\nMove out escape the nosy hell.", "Your sister really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't she? \n\nYou're an adult. You can make any decision you want. \n\nSounds like she'll tell your parents about your plan, though. Be prepared. \n\nNTA", "Good lord, after the way you were treated when you were younger, I'm amazed that you've been comfortable moving back, and able to be so cheerful about it.\n\nThat said, given the opportunity, get out of there!  You won't be abandoning them, you'll be moving forward in living your own life as an independent adult.\n\nBut honestly, what your sister did years ago, as a young teen with parents who wouldn't give her room to breathe on her own, shouldn't be thrown in her face.  \n\nNevertheless, NTA.  Helicopter parents sounds cute.  Intrusive parents who treat you like a child are a lot less cute, and you're wise to get away.", "Sister is an enabler, so fuck her.", "Except sis is fine with the control because it never hurt her.", "I would just let them believe you are moving nearby, show interest in the apartments, don't talk about moving away at all to parents or system, and quietly get your ducks in a row in peace, find a job there and then just move out.\n\nAfter that, see them once a year and phone once a month and enjoy how much your mental health will improve.", "She owes you an apology too for the comment about abandoning family. She might not be the cause but she sure as hell is fine with how your parents act and don't care about the damage.", "Whilst your parents are solely responsible for their actions, your sister shouldn\u2019t be trying to guilt you for leaving.", "Absolutely - as someone who had controlling parents, it took me years to see all the nuttiness clearly for what it was - therapy can really speed up that process and make you realise you\u2019re not being unreasonable for being yourself and loving your own life."]}
