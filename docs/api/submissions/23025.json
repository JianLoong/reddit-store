Luke's family go on a big trip in the summer holidays with the kids in a big AirBnB. Usually it is our family, Luke's 3 brothers and their families and not his sister Anna 29f. Anna never wanted to come before as she was single, and she said there was too many kids for her to be around (11 kids from the 4 families) and she wouldn't enjoy the activities set for the kids/couples.\n\nAnna has been dating Dave 33m for the past year and Dave has a son Sam 12m. I have met Dave at family functions with Anna. At our last family dinner at my house, Sam threw a tantrum over not liking the food and tried pulling the tablecloth off the table, spilling food and pushing plates on the floor, and broke some of my tableware. \n\nSam also kicked my older son and tried teaching some of the younger kids swear words. Anna and Dave apologised and were very embarrased by Sam's behaviour and helped clean up. However, neither of them tried disciplining Sam, who ran away with his phone given to him by his mom and watched videos while everyone else was cleaning up. I have met Sam 8 times, and all of them have been negative experiences.\n\nAnna told me that Dave is scared of his ex-wife so he won't override her parenting and she doesn't believe in saying no to Sam.

This year we are going to a large beach house for two weeks, and being there with Sam sounds like a nightmare, as neither Anna or Dave will stop him. Anna called me up and was upset, as she said Sam needed patience and time to adjust as he had been through a lot. Sam's mom is getting remarried and his dad has moved on and excluding Sam from this trip was mean and Anna asked me to tell Sam to his face next time we meet that he will not be coming on the trip. \n\nI tried explaining to her this was a group decision and for the sake of everyone's wellbeing and experience on the trip we had all said no to him.

They also need to agree, in writing, that they will pay for any damages that Sam does to your rental when he is visiting. This is the only way that Sam can transition into being welcome with everyone else, after he has transitioned to your family rules. When he learns to behave, because otherwise he can't stay, and decides it's more fun to play with his \"cousins\" than creating chaos, then he can share your Airbnb. It will be a lot of work for Dave, but he created this problem, no vacation for him until he solves it.", "NTA\n\nUntil Sam can behave around people and not physically assault your kids, he can't be trusted on these trips.

So the parents can fix it or get use to him not being invited to things.", "NTA - This wasn't a decision made solely by you, this was a decision made by the collective group. \n\nI feel for Sam, he is at a strange age developmentally, his parents are no longer together and moving forward with other people.  That said, that is NEVER an excuse for Sam to behave the way he does and for him to be allowed to behave that way without consequences. \n\nVacation rentals come with expectations that if you behave poorly in the rental there will be consequences, however those consequences are usually only for whoever rented the space in their name.  \n\nIt sounds as though Sam currently is unable to regulate his behaviors, unfortunately this leads to property damage as you have experienced first hand.  This type of behavior also has a negative impact on those around him.  The other adults and children should not forced into a position where their vacation is being dictated by a child because his father doesn't want to correct him.  That isn't fair to ANYONE!\n\nAlso, it is not your responsibility to tell Sam why they don't get to go on vacation, that is on his father who won't correct his behavior.", "NTA.

A two-week vacation is not the appropriate setting, especially when Sam\u2019s issues manifest in violence towards other kids and property damage.\n\nYour offered solution is a much better venue (even though it\u2019s not your problem). But definitely shorter exposures and in a better setting where you can control the situation and not impede on family time where the expectation is to relax, enjoy, and have fun. \n\nI think (hope) Anna and Dave\u2019s perspective comes from a \u2018maybe this will be good for Sam to be in a fun family environment and he\u2019ll see we\u2019re great people and chill\u2019 but it\u2019s a lot to expect you to risk turning a vacation into a series of nightmare acting-out incidents.", "NTA\n\nDave set the rule that NO ONE can tell Sam what to do.

Where we draw that line of what to deal with is not easy and drawing it here vs there does implicitly mean you are a bad person.  \nObviously sams behavior was problematic enough that multiple people agreed that inviting him was beyond that line.  \nAdditionally if you did invite him and he ruined many peoples vacation you could be TA for doing so.   \n\nSam is probably going through a lot and needs patience, but patience that his behavior will improve through corrective action.   I see no corrective action described.   If Anna and Dave display corrective action, or understand and allow the other family members to correct his actions at family events then patience should be given.  But some parents and people think that steps over boundaries and that is their right.

You do have every right to set boundaries so their baby mamma drama does not ruin vacations, but they are also allowed to be upset. Yes, it's partially their fault, but they are in a position where their options aren't great. Coparenting when one party is a tyrant and weaponized the kid against the other parent is really hard on kids. Sam is going through a lot. It's not your responsibility, but I can understand why Dave and Anna are upset. They're probably not in a great place to be thinking clearly. I wouldn't say that makes them the assholes, I think it just makes them human.\n\nIt does sound like your relationship is tense but not destroyed, so I think that you're on the right track setting boundaries on vacations but offering to spend time with them separately. You sound emotionally mature and sympathetic to their issues, so I think you handled this well.", "NTA\n\nTell him to his face if they're too gutless.

This is not a \"he just needs a little bit of grace through this tough time\" situation.  This is a child who apparently was never disciplined or taught how to act in the presence of others.  Dave has a lot of work to do at home to undo the years of neglectful parenting where they failed to properly socialize and set boundaries for Sam before Sam is ready to attend the family gatherings and vacations of people who aren't actually his family.  At this point, Sam is your SIL's boyfriend's son and that's it.  She's asking a lot for someone who has no formal ties to anyone in your family including herself.  I'm not saying to ostracize the kid, but the level of time, care, and attention Anna is asking you all to devote to a child her boyfriend can't commit to actively parent is unreasonable considering Anna and Dave could break up tomorrow and you would never see Sam again.

While his behavior is the manifestation of the problem, the crux of the issue is an unhealthy dynamic.

It\u2019s also unfair to him that his parents have been pretending that the trip is still happening, as that anticipation will deepen his disappointment.

I do like the idea of this compromise but overall, I\u2019ve said this in other replies, I personally would be unwilling to risk what sounds like a fun annual family vacation\u2026 especially a two-week vacation. If things go sideways (and I feel like there\u2019s a very high probability of that considering Dave\u2019s lack of parenting) two weeks of misery is not the kind of vacation memories one wants. Call me selfish or pessimistic, but I would not want to go into it with the anxiety of imminent disaster on the horizon!", "i really like this idea.", "Yeah. I think this is just a difficult position to put OP in. Yes, OP can step up and your suggestion is much better than what I think Anna intended. And yes, this can let Sam see how a healthy family works. And definitely making Dave a part of this is necessary. \n\nBut holy moly! Parents who don\u2019t want to parent and put the onus on third party to do their job? That\u2019s sh*tty. And Dave is a huge part of this problem by outright refusing to discipline Sam. \n\nAlso, perhaps from a selfish viewpoint, I would not want to turn a two-week vacation into an experiment on behavior management of a pre-teen with a history of violent and destructive behavior. If it were a weekend getaway, I might be more willing. But two-weeks is a long time, and also a more costly experiment."]}
