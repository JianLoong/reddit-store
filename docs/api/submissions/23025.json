Luke's family go on a big trip in the summer holidays with the kids in a big AirBnB. Usually it is our family, Luke's 3 brothers and their families and not his sister Anna 29f. Anna never wanted to come before as she was single, and she said there was too many kids for her to be around (11 kids from the 4 families) and she wouldn't enjoy the activities set for the kids/couples.\n\nAnna has been dating Dave 33m for the past year and Dave has a son Sam 12m. I have met Dave at family functions with Anna. At our last family dinner at my house, Sam threw a tantrum over not liking the food and tried pulling the tablecloth off the table, spilling food and pushing plates on the floor, and broke some of my tableware. \n\nSam also kicked my older son and tried teaching some of the younger kids swear words. Anna and Dave apologised and were very embarrased by Sam's behaviour and helped clean up. However, neither of them tried disciplining Sam, who ran away with his phone given to him by his mom and watched videos while everyone else was cleaning up. I have met Sam 8 times, and all of them have been negative experiences.\n\nAnna told me that Dave is scared of his ex-wife so he won't override her parenting and she doesn't believe in saying no to Sam. Everytime Anna tries saying something to Sam, he just reminds her that she is not his real mum.\n\nThis year, as a family, we had invited Anna and Dave to come along to the trip, however after meeting Sam, we collectively decided to uninvite them if they brought Sam. This year we are going to a large beach house for two weeks, and being there with Sam sounds like a nightmare, as neither Anna or Dave will stop him. Anna called me up and was upset, as she said Sam needed patience and time to adjust as he had been through a lot. Sam's mom is getting remarried and his dad has moved on and excluding Sam from this trip was mean and Anna asked me to tell Sam to his face next time we meet that he will not be coming on the trip. \n\nI tried explaining to her this was a group decision and for the sake of everyone's wellbeing and experience on the trip we had all said no to him.

They also need to agree, in writing, that they will pay for any damages that Sam does to your rental when he is visiting. This is the only way that Sam can transition into being welcome with everyone else, after he has transitioned to your family rules. When he learns to behave, because otherwise he can't stay, and decides it's more fun to play with his \"cousins\" than creating chaos, then he can share your Airbnb. It will be a lot of work for Dave, but he created this problem, no vacation for him until he solves it.", "NTA\n\nUntil Sam can behave around people and not physically assault your kids, he can't be trusted on these trips.

So the parents can fix it or get use to him not being invited to things.", "NTA - This wasn't a decision made solely by you, this was a decision made by the collective group. \n\nI feel for Sam, he is at a strange age developmentally, his parents are no longer together and moving forward with other people.  That said, that is NEVER an excuse for Sam to behave the way he does and for him to be allowed to behave that way without consequences. \n\nVacation rentals come with expectations that if you behave poorly in the rental there will be consequences, however those consequences are usually only for whoever rented the space in their name.  \n\nIt sounds as though Sam currently is unable to regulate his behaviors, unfortunately this leads to property damage as you have experienced first hand.  This type of behavior also has a negative impact on those around him.  The other adults and children should not forced into a position where their vacation is being dictated by a child because his father doesn't want to correct him.  That isn't fair to ANYONE!\n\nAlso, it is not your responsibility to tell Sam why they don't get to go on vacation, that is on his father who won't correct his behavior.", "NTA.

A two-week vacation is not the appropriate setting, especially when Sam\u2019s issues manifest in violence towards other kids and property damage.\n\nYour offered solution is a much better venue (even though it\u2019s not your problem).

Where we draw that line of what to deal with is not easy and drawing it here vs there does implicitly mean you are a bad person.  \nObviously sams behavior was problematic enough that multiple people agreed that inviting him was beyond that line.  \nAdditionally if you did invite him and he ruined many peoples vacation you could be TA for doing so.   \n\nSam is probably going through a lot and needs patience, but patience that his behavior will improve through corrective action.   I see no corrective action described.   If Anna and Dave display corrective action, or understand and allow the other family members to correct his actions at family events then patience should be given.  But some parents and people think that steps over boundaries and that is their right.

You do have every right to set boundaries so their baby mamma drama does not ruin vacations, but they are also allowed to be upset. Yes, it's partially their fault, but they are in a position where their options aren't great. Coparenting when one party is a tyrant and weaponized the kid against the other parent is really hard on kids. Sam is going through a lot. It's not your responsibility, but I can understand why Dave and Anna are upset. They're probably not in a great place to be thinking clearly. I wouldn't say that makes them the assholes, I think it just makes them human.\n\nIt does sound like your relationship is tense but not destroyed, so I think that you're on the right track setting boundaries on vacations but offering to spend time with them separately. You sound emotionally mature and sympathetic to their issues, so I think you handled this well.", "NTA\n\nTell him to his face if they're too gutless.

At this point, Sam is your SIL's boyfriend's son and that's it.  She's asking a lot for someone who has no formal ties to anyone in your family including herself.  I'm not saying to ostracize the kid, but the level of time, care, and attention Anna is asking you all to devote to a child her boyfriend can't commit to actively parent is unreasonable considering Anna and Dave could break up tomorrow and you would never see Sam again.

Parents who don\u2019t want to parent and put the onus on third party to do their job? That\u2019s sh*tty. And Dave is a huge part of this problem by outright refusing to discipline Sam. \n\nAlso, perhaps from a selfish viewpoint, I would not want to turn a two-week vacation into an experiment on behavior management of a pre-teen with a history of violent and destructive behavior. If it were a weekend getaway, I might be more willing. But two-weeks is a long time, and also a more costly experiment.", "Nta. Honestly eff kids who weren\u2019t raised properly.

The second he steps out of line, Dave immediately removes him to a place without any other kids until he gets himself together to be social. Since no one else can discipline his child, it's all on Dave to supervise and discipline his own son. Sucks to be him. It may take the whole week, it may take more than one year. Sam is never allowed to be unsupervised until he becomes a non feral child. Dave will have no chance to relax around the family until his child can integrate.

This idea only works if Dave acknowledges that this is a problem he helped create and it's on him to do the work to fix it. No slacking off on monitoring Sam. No letting ANY behavior slide. A tantrum starts- we are leaving- we will try again tomorrow.", "No way that would work. Dave has to never leave his child's side if he wants to start fixing the problem to eventually- in a year or two- to be able to relax when his son learns to behave in public. Or he can do nothing and bail his kid out of jail in a few more years... for assault, disorderly conduct, etc. He needs to grow a shiny spine and tell his kid no. Children need rules and consequences in order to feel safe and cared for.", "He\u2019s 12. Is a group confrontation in a public place really the right move? How\u2019s this obviously messed up expected to have the wherewithal to deal with that? Sounds extreme to me.", "Oh I'm sure it is something along those lines. Seriously, for Sam's sake, I hope that they all get some counseling (I was including the mother). I really wish people would think about what they are doing to the kid while their effing with their exes...\n\nStill, not OP's problem and totally out of his control."]}
