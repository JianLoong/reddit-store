Luke's family go on a big trip in the summer holidays with the kids in a big AirBnB. Usually it is our family, Luke's 3 brothers and their families and not his sister Anna 29f. Anna never wanted to come before as she was single, and she said there was too many kids for her to be around (11 kids from the 4 families) and she wouldn't enjoy the activities set for the kids/couples.\n\nAnna has been dating Dave 33m for the past year and Dave has a son Sam 12m. I have met Dave at family functions with Anna. At our last family dinner at my house, Sam threw a tantrum over not liking the food and tried pulling the tablecloth off the table, spilling food and pushing plates on the floor, and broke some of my tableware. \n\nSam also kicked my older son and tried teaching some of the younger kids swear words. Anna and Dave apologised and were very embarrased by Sam's behaviour and helped clean up. However, neither of them tried disciplining Sam, who ran away with his phone given to him by his mom and watched videos while everyone else was cleaning up. I have met Sam 8 times, and all of them have been negative experiences.\n\nAnna told me that Dave is scared of his ex-wife so he won't override her parenting and she doesn't believe in saying no to Sam.

This year we are going to a large beach house for two weeks, and being there with Sam sounds like a nightmare, as neither Anna or Dave will stop him. Anna called me up and was upset, as she said Sam needed patience and time to adjust as he had been through a lot. Sam's mom is getting remarried and his dad has moved on and excluding Sam from this trip was mean and Anna asked me to tell Sam to his face next time we meet that he will not be coming on the trip. \n\nI tried explaining to her this was a group decision and for the sake of everyone's wellbeing and experience on the trip we had all said no to him.

They also need to agree, in writing, that they will pay for any damages that Sam does to your rental when he is visiting. This is the only way that Sam can transition into being welcome with everyone else, after he has transitioned to your family rules. When he learns to behave, because otherwise he can't stay, and decides it's more fun to play with his \"cousins\" than creating chaos, then he can share your Airbnb. It will be a lot of work for Dave, but he created this problem, no vacation for him until he solves it.", "NTA\n\nUntil Sam can behave around people and not physically assault your kids, he can't be trusted on these trips.

So the parents can fix it or get use to him not being invited to things.", "NTA - This wasn't a decision made solely by you, this was a decision made by the collective group. \n\nI feel for Sam, he is at a strange age developmentally, his parents are no longer together and moving forward with other people.  That said, that is NEVER an excuse for Sam to behave the way he does and for him to be allowed to behave that way without consequences. \n\nVacation rentals come with expectations that if you behave poorly in the rental there will be consequences, however those consequences are usually only for whoever rented the space in their name.  \n\nIt sounds as though Sam currently is unable to regulate his behaviors, unfortunately this leads to property damage as you have experienced first hand.  This type of behavior also has a negative impact on those around him.  The other adults and children should not forced into a position where their vacation is being dictated by a child because his father doesn't want to correct him.

A two-week vacation is not the appropriate setting, especially when Sam\u2019s issues manifest in violence towards other kids and property damage.\n\nYour offered solution is a much better venue (even though it\u2019s not your problem).

Where we draw that line of what to deal with is not easy and drawing it here vs there does implicitly mean you are a bad person.  \nObviously sams behavior was problematic enough that multiple people agreed that inviting him was beyond that line.  \nAdditionally if you did invite him and he ruined many peoples vacation you could be TA for doing so.   \n\nSam is probably going through a lot and needs patience, but patience that his behavior will improve through corrective action.   I see no corrective action described.   If Anna and Dave display corrective action, or understand and allow the other family members to correct his actions at family events then patience should be given.  But some parents and people think that steps over boundaries and that is their right.

You do have every right to set boundaries so their baby mamma drama does not ruin vacations, but they are also allowed to be upset. Yes, it's partially their fault, but they are in a position where their options aren't great. Coparenting when one party is a tyrant and weaponized the kid against the other parent is really hard on kids. Sam is going through a lot. It's not your responsibility, but I can understand why Dave and Anna are upset. They're probably not in a great place to be thinking clearly. I wouldn't say that makes them the assholes, I think it just makes them human.\n\nIt does sound like your relationship is tense but not destroyed, so I think that you're on the right track setting boundaries on vacations but offering to spend time with them separately. You sound emotionally mature and sympathetic to their issues, so I think you handled this well.", "NTA\n\nTell him to his face if they're too gutless.

At this point, Sam is your SIL's boyfriend's son and that's it.  She's asking a lot for someone who has no formal ties to anyone in your family including herself.  I'm not saying to ostracize the kid, but the level of time, care, and attention Anna is asking you all to devote to a child her boyfriend can't commit to actively parent is unreasonable considering Anna and Dave could break up tomorrow and you would never see Sam again.

Parents who don\u2019t want to parent and put the onus on third party to do their job? That\u2019s sh*tty. And Dave is a huge part of this problem by outright refusing to discipline Sam. \n\nAlso, perhaps from a selfish viewpoint, I would not want to turn a two-week vacation into an experiment on behavior management of a pre-teen with a history of violent and destructive behavior. If it were a weekend getaway, I might be more willing. But two-weeks is a long time, and also a more costly experiment.", "Nta. Honestly eff kids who weren\u2019t raised properly.

It\u2019s tough for the kid, but the adults in his life made him this way and he has to start seeing consequences at some point.\n\nHope the parents figure out parenting him and get him into therapy. I feel bad for him being left out but at the same time, why should everyone else\u2019s vacation be ruined by bad behavior.", "hmmm. Nta, BUT Sam is old enough to understand following rules and being nice to people. It has nothing to do with a parent who isn't there to parent him.\n\nIf Anna & Dave don't want him excluded (with their agreement), don't tell him that he is excluded. Tell him that he can accept the rules & consequences for breaking them, or he can be excluded. If Anna & Dave can't or won't discipline him, give that role to someone else.\n\nOtherwise they can stay somewhere else nearby.", "If this kid went to Willy Wonka's factory, there would be a group of tiny pygmies singing a song about him.", "ESH.  I would have said, he has been destructive and the rest of us refuse to held accountable for any damage he does to the Airbnb and they are welcome to come, but they need to find their own place to stay.  FYI - you kids are going to learn swear words any day now on their own.", "Wow, what conditional love this family has! \"Your son is annoying and you don't do what we think is appropriate, so you're out.\" YTA. Empathy, forgiveness, collaboration - that's more family style.", "I'd say YTA unless you give them the opportunity to bring Sam along with rules that are clearly communicated to him ahead of time. He can't use physical violence. He can't use bad language. He can't (intentionally) break things. If he agrees to all those things -- then you should be good to go. If he breaks his word -- then you need to be allowed to punish him. If the dad is afraid of his ex -- he should probably just be too afraid to be left with Sam at all. Let him know that if he wants to be a dad -- great! You support him... being a dad. What he's not allowed to do though is bringing a kid along to be with others and refusing to parent him. It's not too late to give him a chance.", "If she would like you to tell him why he\u2019s not invited, then do so.  He is old enough to know not to behave like that and he is also old enough to understand that there are consequences.  No one enjoys being around chaos and meanness.", "NTA you are looking for a family vacation, not therapy for sam who to use the phrase -doesn't play well with others'- If his parents will not discipline him you're under no obligation to bring him. to ruin your time. \n\nDoes she really want you to tell him? great! go for it, and don't sugar coat it \"We don't want you to come along because you are rude and can't behave. we all decided this.\"", "NTA. Sam is violent in more ways than one. Either they stop him from doing stuff/discipline him, or stay behind. Other people should not have to be hurt or have their vacation ruined because someone won\u00b4t parent their kid.", "NTA,\n\nI completely understand Anna not wanting to come when there are kids. I am the same way with my family, family vacations are now factored around making sure the kids are having fun like going to a place known for their water parks. I'm sure I would have fun there but would also be required to spend time watching the kids.\n\nI understand Anna wanting to come now that she is helping with a kid but that kid is a problem and yeah it is not your family's responsibility to watch for it. It sucks that the kid's mother has it so where Dave can't parent but that's not your fault.", "NTA\n\nSam doesn't need patience and time. He needs parenting.", "NTA  \n\n\nAmerican vacation time is so limited, sorry, no, no way I'm risking my precious days off watching someone else's poorly parented child destroy that peace and quiet. Dave and Anna don't have any follow through as parents, what makes anyone on Reddit think they'll follow through on some vacation compromise?", "I\u2019ve never met Sam, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck with him for 2 weeks. I\u2019d probably be forced to do some very petty things to a 12 year old. I\u2019d choose violence every morning.", "Tell it straight to Sam's face that his attitude and behavior is preventing him, his dad, and Anna from being invited on the trip. NTA", "NTA", "NTA but why not say to Sam's face why he is not invited:\n\"Sam, you are not welcome on this trip because you are rude. You have broken my dishes, messed up my house, been violent and frankly acted like a 2 year old instead of a 12 year old. If over the coming year you can learn to behave, we will think about inviting you. Here is a lesson for life: actions have consequences, you behaved badly, so no beach for you.\"", "NTA. Do explain to Sam to his face, but as gently as possible, why he's not invited. Maybe he'll think about his actions. Or maybe he'd be \"screw you, I didn't want to go anyways.\" but at least you tried.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be around that kind of behavior either as it would be miserable! Sam's dad actually parented him and allowed Anna to help with that, there's a chance his behavior would be more appropriate for outings like this.   \n\n\nKids will be kids, as in there will be periods of misbehavior, but this sounds like excessively poor behavior. It will get worse if they don't step up the parenting game. Anyways, it's a fair lesson for Sam to learn that poor behavior has consequences.", "NTA.  They won't stop the child so he knows he can do ANYTHING he wants to.  He would ruin the trip for the rest of the people and quite frankly, he probably wouldn't have fun. \n\nCould you have them come for the first weekend? See how that goes and if he is OK, they can come back for the last weekend.  Baby steps so he sees what is required/allowed, they can participate but if he is a hellion, they don't come back.", "ESH, so because you aren't privy to everything you're set on excluding them? And for the record I don't blame SIL for declining a \"vacation\" with 11 children before she was at the stage where kids are an everyday part of her life. That would be stressful and I'm sure she would have been roped into a babysitter so the parents could get a break.", "NTA. But this is your hubbys family and he should be speaking to her, not you. Honestly though, I would be so concerned for the kids if this is the behaviour of a preteen around them and ensuring that they are not anywhere near each other without supervision.", "They want you to tell Sam to his face - \n\nThis outlines the problem completely - they won't confront HIS behavior.   Going thru a lot is not carte blanche for being an AH.", "NTA\n\nYour children's safety is more important then Sam's feelings.\n\nAlso, Sam wouldn't know he was excluded unless your sister or his Dad said something to him.  They are all awful parents.  If this was truly about Sam, they could organize a trip for just the three of them.", "This is a great idea!\n\nNTA, OP", "I did this with a family member who doesn't discipline their kids at all. Straight up just told them I didn't want to play with them anymore because of their behavior (trying to trip me or hurling the ball straight at my face while playing casual basketball). They've been much better behaved since. I was calm and didn't call names, just explained that they were making it not-fun for me and asked them if they would keep playing with a kid who treated them the way they treated me (spoiler: answer was an embarrassed \"no\").", "Seriously? They\u2019ve given the kid 8 chances. It\u2019s not on OP or the family to impose rules that the parents won\u2019t enforce and it will be so much worse kicking them off of the vacation after the fact than it is to not invite the demon at all. \n\nThey aren\u2019t his parents. They aren\u2019t even his family as they have no close connection to him at all. They are under no obligation to risk their trip by inviting someone who they have only had bad experiences with.", "Im afraid I cant agree with this.\n\n\"Sam also kicked my older son\"\n\nViolence towards my children is a 'one strike and your out' kind of deal. Sam is twelve, kicking a 6 year old. \n\nOn what basis is it remotely justifiable for the OP to allow Sam within reaching distance of OPs children?", "Amen on that with Anna and the relationship.  I would tell Dave he either has to parent or she is out.", "Yeah I mean if I had broken things or pulled a tablecloth off as a small child my parents would've lost it, much less at 12?", "that's my thought. cut sam out and tell him why 'you can't behave and we don't want to put up with you.' sometimes it takes a really hard slap like that to make someone-even a kid- wake up. \n\nremember what C.S. Lewis wrote . \"His name was Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he very nearly deserved it.\"", "He's 12. He'll say whatever he thinks you need to hear so he gets to have the good time. He *may* even believe it at the time he commits. 5 minutes later he will have forgotten. Your idea might work to an extent with properly parented kids, not here.\n\nLook, you lot need to understand that he's probably getting fecked over by his unstable home life. He's not able to deal with that - he's only 12! He needs major help.", "My suggestion is they come for the first weekend.  If he is not a hellion, they can come back for the last weekend.  I don't see the parents stopping this. I kind of feel sorry for the kid....", "I think it\u2019s utterly ridiculous and doomed to all kinds of failure.", "I agree.\n\nOP putting her children in harms way wouldnt be remotely justifiable to me."]}
