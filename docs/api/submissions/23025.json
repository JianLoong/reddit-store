Luke's family go on a big trip in the summer holidays with the kids in a big AirBnB. Usually it is our family, Luke's 3 brothers and their families and not his sister Anna 29f. Anna never wanted to come before as she was single, and she said there was too many kids for her to be around (11 kids from the 4 families) and she wouldn't enjoy the activities set for the kids/couples.\n\nAnna has been dating Dave 33m for the past year and Dave has a son Sam 12m. I have met Dave at family functions with Anna. At our last family dinner at my house, Sam threw a tantrum over not liking the food and tried pulling the tablecloth off the table, spilling food and pushing plates on the floor, and broke some of my tableware. \n\nSam also kicked my older son and tried teaching some of the younger kids swear words. Anna and Dave apologised and were very embarrased by Sam's behaviour and helped clean up. However, neither of them tried disciplining Sam, who ran away with his phone given to him by his mom and watched videos while everyone else was cleaning up. I have met Sam 8 times, and all of them have been negative experiences.\n\nAnna told me that Dave is scared of his ex-wife so he won't override her parenting and she doesn't believe in saying no to Sam. Everytime Anna tries saying something to Sam, he just reminds her that she is not his real mum.\n\nThis year, as a family, we had invited Anna and Dave to come along to the trip, however after meeting Sam, we collectively decided to uninvite them if they brought Sam. This year we are going to a large beach house for two weeks, and being there with Sam sounds like a nightmare, as neither Anna or Dave will stop him. Anna called me up and was upset, as she said Sam needed patience and time to adjust as he had been through a lot. Sam's mom is getting remarried and his dad has moved on and excluding Sam from this trip was mean and Anna asked me to tell Sam to his face next time we meet that he will not be coming on the trip. \n\nI tried explaining to her this was a group decision and for the sake of everyone's wellbeing and experience on the trip we had all said no to him. I offered to spend more time with Sam, Dave and Anna separately outside the trip as a family but she declined and will not speak to me. The rest of the family agree with me, but the trip is next week now, and I am not sure we are actually in the right.", "created_utc": 1690213225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158e68x/aita_for_excluding_my_sil_and_her_family_on_a/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They also need to agree, in writing, that they will pay for any damages that Sam does to your rental when he is visiting. This is the only way that Sam can transition into being welcome with everyone else, after he has transitioned to your family rules. When he learns to behave, because otherwise he can't stay, and decides it's more fun to play with his \"cousins\" than creating chaos, then he can share your Airbnb. It will be a lot of work for Dave, but he created this problem, no vacation for him until he solves it.", "NTA\n\nUntil Sam can behave around people and not physically assault your kids, he can't be trusted on these trips.  This is Anna and Dave's problem to solve.", "NTA.\n\n>she said Sam needed patience and time to adjust\n\nWhen he's had that time and he's adjusted he'll be able to join you all. Until then it's not possible.", "NTA\n\n\nPoor parenting has created a child that can not be disciplined by anyone, as instructed by Dave. If this child is a physical violence threat to the younger children and teaching then to behave poorly the only recourse is to not include him.", "NTA it is unfair for one child to ruin everyone\u2019s vacation. And to be quite honest if this child\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t get addressed not only will he be left out of this vacation NO ONE will want him around. \n\nThis child will be excluded from more and more things unless something is done about his behavior. So the parents can fix it or get use to him not being invited to things.", "NTA - This wasn't a decision made solely by you, this was a decision made by the collective group. \n\nI feel for Sam, he is at a strange age developmentally, his parents are no longer together and moving forward with other people.  That said, that is NEVER an excuse for Sam to behave the way he does and for him to be allowed to behave that way without consequences. \n\nVacation rentals come with expectations that if you behave poorly in the rental there will be consequences, however those consequences are usually only for whoever rented the space in their name.  \n\nIt sounds as though Sam currently is unable to regulate his behaviors, unfortunately this leads to property damage as you have experienced first hand.  This type of behavior also has a negative impact on those around him.  The other adults and children should not forced into a position where their vacation is being dictated by a child because his father doesn't want to correct him.  That isn't fair to ANYONE!\n\nAlso, it is not your responsibility to tell Sam why they don't get to go on vacation, that is on his father who won't correct his behavior.", "NTA. It\u2019s a family VACATION not a two-week family INTERVENTION. I\u2019m sorry the kid\u2019s going through stuff but it\u2019s an Anna & Dave problem that they need to work on. A two-week vacation is not the appropriate setting, especially when Sam\u2019s issues manifest in violence towards other kids and property damage.\n\nYour offered solution is a much better venue (even though it\u2019s not your problem). But definitely shorter exposures and in a better setting where you can control the situation and not impede on family time where the expectation is to relax, enjoy, and have fun. \n\nI think (hope) Anna and Dave\u2019s perspective comes from a \u2018maybe this will be good for Sam to be in a fun family environment and he\u2019ll see we\u2019re great people and chill\u2019 but it\u2019s a lot to expect you to risk turning a vacation into a series of nightmare acting-out incidents.", "NTA\n\nDave set the rule that NO ONE can tell Sam what to do.  The only thing left is not allow Sam to come.  If Dave & Anna can't get their head around that, then why do they want to come and ruin everyone's trip.  That is super rude on their part.  They are the only AH's.", "NTA If Sam can do whatever he wants *including break things,*, Sam's mother is the one who should take him on vacation and be responsible(HA!) for his actions.", "NTA - I do feel bad for the kid to a degree but frankly he has no entitlement to come and based on his actions I don't see why you all should suffer the consequences of his mums parenting. \n\nHe's 12 years old, If i were the parents I would take this as a teaching opportunity that if you don't behave appropriately you miss out on nice things. Tough lesson but maybe needed.", "NTA.  Because the boyfriend is afraid of his ex, everyone else has to be miserable? No!\n\nThat little boy is not going to learn anything except Dad and Anna will never punish him. They are creating a nightmare.", ">tell Sam to his face next time we meet that he will not be coming on the trip. \n\nCall their bluff. Tell him to his face that his behavior is the reason his family aren't welcome on the trip.", "NTA.   First of all this was a collective decision.  I don\u2019t think you need to feel all the blame.   Is Anna mad at specifically you or everyone?  \nIt\u2019s a hard place to be as it\u2019s your vacation and you want to enjoy it, yet Sam would make that more difficult.  But this is all family and everyone should be included.   (However Anna and Dave are not married so thin but important veil of deniability there). \nAs good people we all have to suck it up and deal with things we don\u2019t want to.  Where we draw that line of what to deal with is not easy and drawing it here vs there does implicitly mean you are a bad person.  \nObviously sams behavior was problematic enough that multiple people agreed that inviting him was beyond that line.  \nAdditionally if you did invite him and he ruined many peoples vacation you could be TA for doing so.   \n\nSam is probably going through a lot and needs patience, but patience that his behavior will improve through corrective action.   I see no corrective action described.   If Anna and Dave display corrective action, or understand and allow the other family members to correct his actions at family events then patience should be given.  But some parents and people think that steps over boundaries and that is their right.  However those people must understand that if they don\u2019t correct or don\u2019t allow their children to be corrected to behave properly in the given setting that they will not be welcome in said setting.", "NTA. Actions (and inactions) have consequences.", "NTA growing up I had a cousin I abhored. Dude was a shit stain. Made things miserable for us whenever he was around. Him not being there was a means to celebrate. Your ensuring your kids have a good safe environment.  \n\nSam is 12 and is old enough to get it. He need structure, discipline, and distractions. His dad is not providing that. He will be bored and act out relentlessly.  \n\nUnless they get their parenting together, it's not worth the trauma to your kids", "NTA\n\nSam is *12 years old*, more than old enough to know his actions are inexcusable yet he also knows he can get away with it\n\nAnna has a husband problem, which isn\u2019t your problem \n\nTbh, if she wants you to tell Sam, do it \u201cListen here you little shit, you\u2019re not going on vacation because you\u2019re an insufferable prick\u201d \n\nI mean, kid tried to teach your kids to cuss so these words won\u2019t be anything new to his entitled ass", "NTA it\u2019s Dave\u2019s fault Sam isn\u2019t invited due to his failure to parent at all.", "NTA. But you should explain to the kid why and tell him you'd love to include him jn the future if he can behave", "So that's how you raise a career criminal!", "How did you get stuck delivering the news?\n\nDave can tell his son.", "NAH. If you all made a group decision to exclude a factor that would ruin a vacation and expose you to added charges for property damage, and what you say about Sam being out of control is correct, then you're NTA.\n\nThis is a hard situation, OP, and it sounds like Anna and Dave are going through a lot. You do have every right to set boundaries so their baby mamma drama does not ruin vacations, but they are also allowed to be upset. Yes, it's partially their fault, but they are in a position where their options aren't great. Coparenting when one party is a tyrant and weaponized the kid against the other parent is really hard on kids. Sam is going through a lot. It's not your responsibility, but I can understand why Dave and Anna are upset. They're probably not in a great place to be thinking clearly. I wouldn't say that makes them the assholes, I think it just makes them human.\n\nIt does sound like your relationship is tense but not destroyed, so I think that you're on the right track setting boundaries on vacations but offering to spend time with them separately. You sound emotionally mature and sympathetic to their issues, so I think you handled this well.", "NTA\n\nTell him to his face if they're too gutless. Then let him come and enforce the consequence of if you play up, you're gone. Having an actual consequence enforced will be good for him. Just excluding him from the start will only make him feel more justified in his bad behaviour around your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
