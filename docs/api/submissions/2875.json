She wanted to focus on her daughter and not be bombarded. She has a right to do that and have privacy. It was a reasonable response. If she allowed every person to take pics with her the poor woman would never have any space for self care and family time.

It must have been hard to see your daughter disappointed, but you're handling it like a complete goon.", "YTA \nA is a celebrity, but that does not make her available to you or your daughter on an at-will basis. \n\nAs disappointed at your daughter is, imagine how happy A's daughter is that her mom chose to spend that time focused on their relationship and not the fans.", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYTA", "YTA, celebrities are allowed to go about their day with their family without having to interact with fans.

Hopefully she's still young enough for you to start raising her properly and un-brat her", "My favorite line:\n\n\u201cA 1 minute interaction with a dan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re angry that the world did not revolve around your daughter. \n\nIt\u2019s YOUR entitlement that does it for me YTA. \n\nCelebrities are constantly being pulled from their families to be other places that are a requirement of their job. So anytime they are with their kids is precious. \n\nAdditionally, celebrities are people and you would be a better parent to help your child understand that not only should she NOT idolize these very normal and real people, she isn\u2019t entitled to their time and energy or pictures with them just because she sees them out in public. If you want that meet and greet experience for your daughter, pay for it. \n\nAnd for any thoughts in regards to \u201cthey\u2019re celebrities, it\u2019s part of the job\u201d - well it isn\u2019t and that is a shitty line of thinking. Whatever a celebrity does is their job, but when they aren\u2019t doing that or something directly in correlation with that, they aren\u2019t working and deserve to be left alone. Imagine if you\u2019re an accountant out having lunch with your friends and people start approaching your table and asking tax questions. Or you\u2019re a server with the night off and at a bar someone demands you get them a drink because it\u2019s your job? This is so bizarre that so many people think that celebrities must be working 24/7 and aren\u2019t allowed to do anything free of harassment and if they enforce the very natural boundary of \u201cI\u2019m not at work right now \u201c they are seen as jerks who are entitled! \n\nGross", "If she spent 1 minute with every fan then her whole day would be consumed and she wouldn't get to spend time with her daughter.

WTF is wrong with this lady???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you're just posting until you find a group that is willing to back you. Bashing the celebrity is EXACTLY what you're trying to do. You're disgusting.", "If OP & her daughter were at a convention or event, or if they had backstage tickets to a concert , or if they were at a meet & greet etc, then I can understand expecting the celebrity to act a certain way & to be receptive of fans. But the celebrity & her daughter were just trying to exist as human beings in a public place. OP has no ability to differentiate between those two concepts - that the celebrity doesn\u2019t need to be \u201con\u201d as a celebrity every time they need to exist in a public space.", "But it\u2019s only 1 minute x the 30 people who show up when they see a commotion being made, x every single time A steps out in public. Hmmm that one minute can sure add up. Wonder how A\u2019s daughter would feel if every time she wanted mom time it got hijacked by entitled fans .  OP needs to learn that even famous people are just people and deserve to have time to themselves", "This post can\u2019t possibly be real lmao", "And decide that one of those things is that they don\u2019t matter that much to their own mother.", "I've seen it myself**.**  I worked a convention where a minor celebrity was appearing and we had to keep out a stalker who was trying to get to him.\n\nPeople think that celebrities should be available to them 24/7 because they are fans.", "At conventions, it's between 50 and a few hundred dollars to get a photo, and the lineups are hours long.\n\nI mean nice work if you can get it, but I don't think I'd want it.", "r/leopardsatemyface is another good one!", "Just joined! Lol", "And frankly Security probably got politely firm after OP continued to ignore the No and begged for a yes. That\u2019s not being rude.", "A few years ago on Ask A Manager there was a school administrator who wrote in because she'd been present at a meeting where a mother had asked an elementary school teacher to work through recess and electives to tutor the mother's child - *every day*. When the teacher said she needed recesses at least to pump breast milk for her own child, the mother told her to bottle feed. \n\nThe truly gobsmacking thing is that the administrator was fretting about how she was going to arrange for a stipend to compensate the teacher for buying formula. The idea that she should have just said, \"No, that won't be possible\" to the already ludicrous tutoring idea - much less the flat-out insane one of telling a teacher how to feed her own child - didn't seem to have occurred to her. It was one of the most gonzo letters I can remember reading.", "Ren\u00e9e Fleming sat and signed autographs for two hours after performing an entire recital, made an appearance at a fundraiser, and THEN CAME BACK to the rest of us that has been waiting in line to meet her. I was second to last. (And, interestingly, the lead prosecutor for the Robert Pickton case was in line next to me). She must have been utterly exhausted because even if all she did that day was get up, dress for the show, and sing, she\u2019d have done a full day\u2019s work. If she had bailed on us and said she was going to bed, I\u2019d have understood.", "Most celebs genuinely appreciate their fans and don't want to let them down or disappoint them, especially if there's been a long wait. Which is one of the reasons beyond basic human decency I wish people just...sucked it up when the celeb says no.", "Exactly. Imagine having to have a fucking security guard to ensure you aren't constantly being stopped in public while trying to spend time with your daughter on her birthday.", "I remember seeing a photo of Justin Bieber eating at what looks like a cafe in Australia and there are like cops holding off about 200 random fan girls just standing there while the dude is just trying to eat\n\nLegitimately actually felt bad for the dude just trying to eat a sandwich and talk to the people he was having lunch with while being gawked at like a zoo animal by strangers", "I was bored in Atlanta once so I decided to do the CNN tour.  After it was finished, I came down to the cafe in the main entry way and grabbed a drink.  I sat for awhile enjoying the atmosphere, and a few tables away, Sanjay Gupta took a seat with his lunch and started chowing down.  It was neat to spot him, and I gave him a nod and a smile, he returned it.  However, as he was probably wolfing his lunch down so that he could go back to work, he got interrupted by at least three groups of people requesting autographs.  He was nice and gave them what they were looking for, but c'mon! He has every right to enjoy his lunch in the cafe like everyone else w/o being approached by strangers.  Had he decided to attend an expo, sure, he should expect fans swarming around him.  But eating his lunch on a workday?  Really?  I know there are no rules written about what to do here, but I would think common courtesy is to let the celebrity do what they want to do privately.", "I have a similar one, but never talked to them. Last day in NYC (moving) and we walk into our local diner during a dead time. It was pretty quiet so I didn\u2019t think much of it. Selected a table near this couple with a toddler about my toddler\u2019s age (when I\u2019m with kids I try to steer clear of people enjoying meals without kids or I can) but not too near. Like 2 tables over. I didn\u2019t really look at them or pay attention. So my kid is getting her pancakes and totally happy and I notice the other child is waving at her and trying to get her attention. As toddlers do. Mine is oblivious. Then I do a double take at the couple with the kid. Matt Damon and his wife. Lol. Now I know why the diner is abnormally subdued. Everyone trying really hard to pretend they aren\u2019t eating in the same small space as a movie star. And of course this is the one time my child decides she\u2019d rather eat pancakes than play. \n\nApparently he went to the same playground I went to all the time but we never crossed paths there. We did once outside our apartment building but I didn\u2019t notice them. My husband did. I was too busy looking for keys. A friend of mine \u201cknew\u201d him from the playground and said he was really nice.", "I think I saw Daniel Radcliffe in London once? He asked me a question I answered as friendly as I could, but awkwardly (I think he asked me if I watched a film or something, but I hadn't). I wasn't sure it was him because I struggle making eye contact in general, but his voice sounded like him. I was attending an event, and this happened when I ducked away to get a breather from socialising all day. After I got back from my breather, some of my friends came rushing over all of a sudden, scrambling through their bags for pens and notepads. When I asked them what's up, they told me they just saw Daniel Radcliffe and wanted to ask for his autograph. My brain was like 'huh, I guess it really was him'. I grew up in London, so there were several instances like this, but this is the one I remember most because my reaction to standing next to him, browsing blurays and DVDs, was such a contrast to how my friends reacted to spotting him. Might be my autism lol.\n\nHampstead Heath is a cool place, I love doing wildlife photography so I used to go there often!", "I\u2019m not even the teeniest, tiniest bit surprised, haha. I\u2019m fortunate that my entire building admin team is female, and younger,  it wouldn\u2019t even be a topic for discussion. \n\nI overheard a conversation my nurse had recently where a mom (our most bonkers mom, by a long shot) was demanding her son get his ADHD meds at exactly 12, not the 11:45 or 12:30 the nurse had available. At 12, the nurse (who only gives meds as an \u201cextra\u201d she gets a bonus for - she is exclusively there for our students with medical needs) has a wheelchair user who needs toilet aide before she leaves for the pool at the high school. Time is non-negotiable. This student has been in our school for longer and her time slot was set way before the nurse even picked up the meds rider. \n\nMom expected us to arrange the entire transportation schedule and the adaptive gym class for multiple schools so Wonderboy could get his meds 15 minutes later.", "I used to cosplay and while I've never been at Jessica Nigri or whoever else's level, I started getting rather popular, in that I've been recognised by someone serving me at Starbucks once. It was jarring because I was so used to being anonymous that being recognised by even one person threw me off and was kind of upsetting ngl. I have anxiety from trauma and I am very socially awkward so idk how I'd be able to live a public life of a celebrity, being recognised in public happened after I unintentionally weaponised my followers which was deeply disturbing and upsetting to me as well (I posted a hateful message I received and the person that sent it didn't make themselves anonymous, and the format didn't allow me a chance to make them anonymous so I just replied to it, they got death threats and stuff...)\n\nI lost a few friends when I stopped cosplaying and removed my online presence, it was just getting too much for me. I found out from this that there are genuinely people out there that believe you sacrifice your right to privacy, anonymity, and autonomy when you become famous. It's such a weird, entitled, and disconnected way of thinking. This is the mindset of the friends I lost, they considered me selfish for 'letting people down' like I did by removing my online presence and stopping a hobby that had become unenjoyable, lifeless, and hollow to me."]}
