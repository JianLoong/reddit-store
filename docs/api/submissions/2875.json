To you, it\u2019s one minute and one fan, but to the celebrity this happens all day long everywhere they go.

You said it yourself. \u201cThat girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.\u201d You were talking about the celebrity but this instead applies to your own daughter, and probably yourself as well. People get really confused about celebrities and admire them and put them on a pedestal. But at the end of the day, you were asking a mother to take away time from her daughter just to appease your daughter.

She wanted to focus on her daughter and not be bombarded. She has a right to do that and have privacy. It was a reasonable response. If she allowed every person to take pics with her the poor woman would never have any space for self care and family time.

Of course YTA.", "\"That girl needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.\"\n\nHAHAHAHA and YTA and a hypocrite to boot.\n\nYou seriously think yours is the only \"one minute interaction with a fan\" she'd have that day if security weren't turning people away? Get a life.", "YTA. \"It's ONE picture!\" Yeah until everyone else who wants one starts getting in line behind you, until suddenly A can't focus on her child at all.

It must have been hard to see your daughter disappointed, but you're handling it like a complete goon.", "YTA \nA is a celebrity, but that does not make her available to you or your daughter on an at-will basis. \n\nAs disappointed at your daughter is, imagine how happy A's daughter is that her mom chose to spend that time focused on their relationship and not the fans.", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nYTA", "YTA, celebrities are allowed to go about their day with their family without having to interact with fans.

Hopefully she's still young enough for you to start raising her properly and un-brat her", "My favorite line:\n\n\u201cA 1 minute interaction with a dan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re angry that the world did not revolve around your daughter. \n\nIt\u2019s YOUR entitlement that does it for me YTA. \n\nCelebrities are constantly being pulled from their families to be other places that are a requirement of their job. So anytime they are with their kids is precious. \n\nAdditionally, celebrities are people and you would be a better parent to help your child understand that not only should she NOT idolize these very normal and real people, she isn\u2019t entitled to their time and energy or pictures with them just because she sees them out in public. If you want that meet and greet experience for your daughter, pay for it. \n\nAnd for any thoughts in regards to \u201cthey\u2019re celebrities, it\u2019s part of the job\u201d - well it isn\u2019t and that is a shitty line of thinking. Whatever a celebrity does is their job, but when they aren\u2019t doing that or something directly in correlation with that, they aren\u2019t working and deserve to be left alone. Imagine if you\u2019re an accountant out having lunch with your friends and people start approaching your table and asking tax questions. Or you\u2019re a server with the night off and at a bar someone demands you get them a drink because it\u2019s your job? This is so bizarre that so many people think that celebrities must be working 24/7 and aren\u2019t allowed to do anything free of harassment and if they enforce the very natural boundary of \u201cI\u2019m not at work right now \u201c they are seen as jerks who are entitled! \n\nGross", "If she spent 1 minute with every fan then her whole day would be consumed and she wouldn't get to spend time with her daughter.
