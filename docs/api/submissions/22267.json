I was helping her cook when I noticed that the jar of pesto was moldy and had expired about a year ago. When I pointed out the mold colonies growing on the pesto, my mother shrugged it off and said that the bottom half of the pesto was still edible. The jar was about 3/4 full, and my mother is generally pretty stubborn about not wasting food. While I try not to waste food either, I was concerned about the mold growing in the pesto. These were large, white colonies on the surface of the sauce, so who knows what could be growing underneath? \n\nI voiced my concerns about getting sick from eating moldy food, and told her that the mold threads could\u2019ve spread to the parts that seemed fine. Despite this, my mother assured me that nothing was wrong with eating it and proceeded to scoop out the top half of the pesto with visibly mold colonies, then dumped the remaining pesto into the pasta. Again, this was moldy pesto that had expired just over a year ago (expiration date was about June 2022). I\u2019m not a picky eater by any means, but I absolutely refuse to eat anything that could put my health at risk, and so I said to my mother that I wouldn\u2019t eat this moldy pesto pasta. \n\nAt this point, my mother got very upset with me and told me that I was overreacting, and that since she had already thrown away more than half of the moldy pesto, the rest was perfectly safe. She also told me that I was being ungrateful for the food that she cooked for me, that I would miss her cooking when I went to college, and that she had eaten expired food many times and was still alive. I still refused, and said I wasn\u2019t hungry anyways as I walked away to avoid eating this pasta. She muttered something under her breath about me being too \u201cAmericanized,\u201d reckless about wasting food, and that expired food isn\u2019t always unsafe to eat. My younger siblings still ate the pasta, and my mother used this as further \u201cevidence\u201d that the pesto was fine, and scooping out the moldy parts was sufficient in making it safe to eat.\n\nNow, it\u2019s the next day, and my siblings appear perfectly fine. My mother used this to emphasize that I was being overdramatic and ungrateful last night. I stood my ground and reiterated that the pesto was moldy and a year over the expiration date, and I wouldn\u2019t have taken the risk of eating it. However, given that my siblings (thankfully) didn\u2019t get sick, I\u2019m starting to think that she was right. I realize that this seems like a small thing to be posting about, but food and the act of preparing it is a big thing in our culture, and I feel awful that I didn\u2019t show much appreciation to my mom for making dinner for us by refusing to eat the pasta. \n\nTLDR: I refused to eat moldy pesto that expired a year ago, and my mother said I was being dramatic and ungrateful.", "created_utc": 1689374744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zumpc/aita_for_refusing_to_eat_moldy_pesto/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
