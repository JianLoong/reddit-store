I can't focus as i have the cold. I feel like shit.\n\nI (19m) have six months old twin girls with a woman named Evie(19). Evie is from USA but has lived in London since she was 15yrs old. Evie and I hate each other so much that I'm surprised we even have babies toghther(we were drunk) Evie goes to the same top university as me but her family is struggling with studens loans. So she thought asking me for money (not a loan) would be ok. I told her no and that it was rude to ask for that much money. Just to clarify my sisters and I (triplets) inherited a ton of money when were were 16. We use it to futher our education and improve our lifestyle. Back to evie. She went ballistic and called me a horrible father for not wanting to help her out. Her family is constantly harassing to the point i don't feel safe. They keep saying i must hwlp out the mother of my girls. ( we have shared custody) They also keeping using the excuse it won't make dent in my bank acount to make me pay up. My sisters are telling me it's not my responsibility to help her out and think she should drop out if money is the issue. I also don't believe that it should be my job to help her out with her education even though though it's technically true that it won't make a dent. the fact she is the mother of my my children is the one reason I feel guilty. Usally I ingore these kinds of people but it's impossible with them. i really want to say fuck off in their faces but i'm not in the mood to stir up trouble. So aita for refusing to pay a penny towards her university\n\nI can smell the single mom hate in the comments. My kids won't struggle as I will always provide for them. I spend more time with my kids while studying. I will pay keep paying for a nanny as i want my kids to be looked after though I will find a way to just have them myself anyway\n\nI don't understand where your getting the idea my kids will struggle. lmao. I'm planning on paying for all my kids clothing,schooling.tech, hobbies,parties , ect\n\nWhat are you teaching my kids? They are 6 months for god sake.\nI bond with them. i spend time with them. I bathe them. I feed them. evie can barely bathe\n\nWe both go to oxford university so she refuses to drop out.", "created_utc": 1668361166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu8cz3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_the_mother_of_my/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only change to this story is twins.", "NTA. There are a lot of people saying you should want to help the mother of your children. Those girls are absolutely your priority but their mother has every ability to take out student loans. Your responsibility is to your children. Would it be super kind to help her out? Absolutely. However, I think the people calling you an AH are the single moms.", "NTA, if she\u2019s struggling with money so much are you sure she can take care of your children ? she\u2019s harassing you, you could get a restraining order against her for this kind of behavior. go to court and get a custody agreement and request contact only be made if it\u2019s in relation to the children. you owe this woman nothing and to put it quite plainly she chose to have your children despite hating your guts and made the decision to be tied to you forever (maybe it was for the money.) go to court. this behavior isn\u2019t ok, who knows what she will say to the children when they\u2019re older about you.", "If you are providing for your kids and they have everything they need. It\u2019s not your responsibilities to help ex partner with uni cost if you don\u2019t want to. Most 18 yrs have enough understanding about the financial costs and loans to attend uni. I get her circumstances has changed with twins, making uni harder.\n\nIf her and her parents keep pushing, which they shouldn\u2019t, you could consider providing more support around the kids if you choose to but not towards uni cost. You will alway have responsible for child support no matter what she earns. As far I understand it. \n\nSometime when people have money, others feel entitled to ask and expect financial support when they either need or want something but it\u2019s not the case. \n\nIt took you both to get into this situation and as you coparent/joint custody, you both need to get this sorted before it\u2019s starts to affect the kids as they do pick up on negative emotions and arguments more than parents realise.\n\nDon\u2019t know if there are other ways you could help, such as living costs, housing, bills within reason and if you feel comfortable to do so, just get everything in writing and legal in case the relationship between two of you completely breaks down. \n\nIf you feel guilty, then figure out why you do feel that way is it because your are being pressured to do thing by other people. It\u2019s because the impact having kids had on ex, however, that was her choice it was unexpected pregnancy, but a clear choice was made to ho through with it. Even without kids, going to uni doesn\u2019t guarantee a good income/job. \n\nOr you feel guilty because your kids aren\u2019t getting things they need, not just money, time, attention, etc. working or full time studying takes a lot of hours/energy and having kids adds to that, do it about finding balance which is what extremely hardand making sure they know they are loved \n\nAt the end of the day if you are doing the very best for the kids, they know they are loved, protected and happy that\u2019s all you can do.\n\nYour NTA, either of you but you both need to be adults about this and find a way to coparent, ensuring that neither of you turning the kids against the other and are happy and know they are loved by both of you.", "Why not loan it to her? Say you'll pay off her student loans and she can borrow whatever else she needs for school, she has to pay you back but it will be interest free? Thats a good compromise I should think.

You are not the asshole for not doing it but it would be a gift to your children to do it.", "NTA. You owe her nothing.

You just focus on being a good dad and provider for your twins and let there mother figure her own shit out NTA!", "NTA. Nope. No. Noughtta. Not at all.\nYou\u2019re only obligation is to your children, not their mother. \nThe audacity that she has asking for money to only benefit herself and then throwing a tantrum when she didn\u2019t like your answer is just mind blowing.\nNTA a billion times over. \nAlso- Make sure that she can\u2019t get access to your money in the event something happens to you though.", "You know, I came really close to saying N-A-H because it's absolutely, 100% true that it is not your legal or even technically your ethical responsibility to help Evie out financially beyond whatever court-mandated child support you are required to give her.\n\nBut I can't do it. Because honestly, **YTA.**\n\nThis sub isn't a legal sub; and it's not \"Is This My Ethical Responsibility?\" It's called \"Am I The Asshole\", and honestly, no matter how I look at it, you really are the asshole in this situation.\n\nBecause this isn't about your relationship with Evie, or how much you hate her. Your whole \"I can't believe we have kids\" is irrelevant because YOU DO have kids. That you wouldn't in a million years want her to be your girlfriend or to be in a relationship with her doesn't matter anymore. She is the mother of your children, and she will be for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd so while, again, it is absolutely true that IT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to help her with her tuition when you can easily afford to . . . what I keep coming back to is that THE PRIORITY HERE SHOULD BE YOUR KIDS, AND IT IS IN YOUR CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS, in the long term, for Evie to have a post-secondary education. In fact, it's in your best interests as well! Here's why:\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with people opting to pursue trades or other work if they're not interested in post-secondary education, Evie is ready and willing to get a degree, and the objective reality is that more education Evie has, the better her job prospects are in the long run, and the more benefits your kids get from being raised by a well-educated, literate mother. Study after study shows that parents with degrees navigate the school system more easily for their own kids, are better able to support them through their schooling, and she is also likely to get a better paying job meaning that she won't have to rely on you to help support them later on. She is less likely to have to take a job working long hours that will leave her exhausted and grumpy, and more likely to have a career with flexibility, that will let her spend more time with your kids in their early years. The benefits are endless. Your sister suggesting that \"if she can't afford it she should drop out\" isn't just hateful, it's potentially detrimental to your kids. Do you WANT them being raised half the time in a household with a mother who was forced to give up her education? Is that the kind of support you think your kids deserve?\n\nYTA because, like most 19-year-olds, you're not thinking of the long-term consequences. You're so busy being childish and petty that you aren't prioritising your kids. It would be different if you couldn't afford it, but you're saying that you can. Easily. So be the bigger person and help their mother, not because you OWE it to her, but because you owe it to yourself and to your children.", "NTA. F she cannot afford college then she shouldn\u2019t attend. Just because you have money doesn\u2019t mean anything. If she signs something for a loan then fine but if you give in now that will continue for the next 18 years of your daughters life with their mom constantly expecting you to provide for her. You only need to provide for your daughters, not their mom.", "NTA what would have been her plan if you didn\u2019t have the money? Part of me feels like she did this on purpose to get you to pay for her education. My mom raised me and my brother as a single mother at the age of 18 & eventually got her college degree. She never demanded for someone else to pay for her education.", "NTA. You\u2019re young - even if it \u201cwon\u2019t make a dent,\u201d you\u2019ll definitely come to use that money at some point. You already share custody of your daughters and in regards to Evie, that\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t need to support their mother especially if you guys aren\u2019t together. If she chose to go to a top university, she also knew how much it would cost her to attend.", "NTA, her studies arent your responsability. If she cant afford the kids, go to court and figure it out. All the comments saying \"Youd let your kids be poor 50% of the time\" are bs, thats why custody is split or given when one of the parents cannot take care of the kids.\n\nAlso, Please use protection , having a kid with someone you despise AT 19 isnt the best way to start your adult life", "NTA - She was struggling to pay before, she can't use the kid as a cash cow. You'll owe whatever the court says you owe.\n\nIn all seriousness though... is it too late to consider giving the kid up for adoption? Giving up your parental rights? You're both young, and quite frankly a bit immature if you're getting drunk enough to hate-fuck. It sounds like co-parenting is going to be a nightmare that screws the kid up for life. I'm also not getting a I wanna be a dad vibe.", "NTA it\u2019s not your problem, unfortunately for her. She is being unfair and demanding things of you that she has no right to, legally or morally.

Those girls are going to grow up with a father and aunts slagging off their mother, using their wealth to bully others and being handed off to a nanny because daddy does not really to care for them.\n\nThis is not about the legality of your situation but your complete apathy towards a young woman who carried a high risk pregnancy while having to put her education on hold in a foreign country with few resources at her disposal while her antagonistic ex and his sisters harassed her. You should have used contraception and she is a fool for bringing two babies into the world before she is able to care for them with a degree and career. Not to mention a baby daddy who makes Cookie Monster look like a gracious philosopher with incredible manners.", "YTA.\n\nYou acknowledge that your education will improve your lifestyle. The same would be true for the MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN who has 50/50 custody.\n\nYou aren't legally obligated, but you know your children will have a better life if their mother is also well-educated.

Both of you for having kids together when you can't get along. \n\nI do want you to consider something though.  You are going to be tied to this woman for the rest of your lives.

If she has to quit school, her career choices, options for where to live, ability to contribute to the costs of raising them, and her general well being will be significantly limited.

That you care more about making dure their mom doesn't get any of your money than you do about their quality of life.\n\nSo, while I completely agree that you aren't obligated to pay for her education, I do think that you are still looking at this situation through the eyes of a single 19 year old, and not through the eyes of a father of two.
