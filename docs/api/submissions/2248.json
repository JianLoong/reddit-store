I can't focus as i have the cold. I feel like shit.\n\nI (19m) have six months old twin girls with a woman named Evie(19). Evie is from USA but has lived in London since she was 15yrs old. Evie and I hate each other so much that I'm surprised we even have babies toghther(we were drunk) Evie goes to the same top university as me but her family is struggling with studens loans. So she thought asking me for money (not a loan) would be ok. I told her no and that it was rude to ask for that much money. Just to clarify my sisters and I (triplets) inherited a ton of money when were were 16. We use it to futher our education and improve our lifestyle. Back to evie. She went ballistic and called me a horrible father for not wanting to help her out. Her family is constantly harassing to the point i don't feel safe. They keep saying i must hwlp out the mother of my girls. ( we have shared custody) They also keeping using the excuse it won't make dent in my bank acount to make me pay up. My sisters are telling me it's not my responsibility to help her out and think she should drop out if money is the issue. I also don't believe that it should be my job to help her out with her education even though it's technically true that it won't make a dent. the fact she is the mother of my children is the one reason I feel guilty. Usally I ingore these kinds of people but it's impossible with them. i really want to say fuck off in their faces but i'm not in the mood to stir up trouble. So aita for refusing to pay a penny towards her university\n\nI don't understand where your getting the idea my kids will struggle. lmao. I'm planning on paying for all my kids clothing,schooling.tech, hobbies,parties , ect\n\nWhat are you teaching your kids? They are 6 months for god sake.\nI bond with them. i spend time with them. I bathe them. I feed them. evie can barely bathe\n\nWe both go to oxford university so she refuses to drop out.\nEvie finishing her oxford has no benefits for me at all. She won't suddenly become a great person if she has money. That isn't how the world works. Also this is number 1 university in uk and top 1-3 in the world. she knew it was not cheap\n\nI have no idea why she is paying so much or how much she is borrowing. Living in oxford is not cheap and i know she over spends. Also not all her loans are from the school which means she which means she owes more money to people", "created_utc": 1668361166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu8cz3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_the_mother_of_my/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only change to this story is twins.", "NTA. There are a lot of people saying you should want to help the mother of your children. Those girls are absolutely your priority but their mother has every ability to take out student loans. Your responsibility is to your children. Would it be super kind to help her out? Absolutely. However, I think the people calling you an AH are the single moms.", "NTA, if she\u2019s struggling with money so much are you sure she can take care of your children ? she\u2019s harassing you, you could get a restraining order against her for this kind of behavior. go to court and get a custody agreement and request contact only be made if it\u2019s in relation to the children. you owe this woman nothing and to put it quite plainly she chose to have your children despite hating your guts and made the decision to be tied to you forever (maybe it was for the money.) go to court. this behavior isn\u2019t ok, who knows what she will say to the children when they\u2019re older about you.", "If you are providing for your kids and they have everything they need. It\u2019s not your responsibilities to help ex partner with uni cost if you don\u2019t want to. Most 18 yrs have enough understanding about the financial costs and loans to attend uni. I get her circumstances has changed with twins, making uni harder.\n\nIf her and her parents keep pushing, which they shouldn\u2019t, you could consider providing more support around the kids if you choose to but not towards uni cost. You will alway have responsible for child support no matter what she earns. As far I understand it. \n\nSometime when people have money, others feel entitled to ask and expect financial support when they either need or want something but it\u2019s not the case. \n\nIt took you both to get into this situation and as you coparent/joint custody, you both need to get this sorted before it\u2019s starts to affect the kids as they do pick up on negative emotions and arguments more than parents realise.\n\nDon\u2019t know if there are other ways you could help, such as living costs, housing, bills within reason and if you feel comfortable to do so, just get everything in writing and legal in case the relationship between two of you completely breaks down. \n\nIf you feel guilty, then figure out why you do feel that way is it because your are being pressured to do thing by other people. It\u2019s because the impact having kids had on ex, however, that was her choice it was unexpected pregnancy, but a clear choice was made to ho through with it. Even without kids, going to uni doesn\u2019t guarantee a good income/job. \n\nOr you feel guilty because your kids aren\u2019t getting things they need, not just money, time, attention, etc. working or full time studying takes a lot of hours/energy and having kids adds to that, do it about finding balance which is what extremely hardand making sure they know they are loved \n\nAt the end of the day if you are doing the very best for the kids, they know they are loved, protected and happy that\u2019s all you can do.\n\nYour NTA, either of you but you both need to be adults about this and find a way to coparent, ensuring that neither of you turning the kids against the other and are happy and know they are loved by both of you.", "Why not loan it to her? Say you'll pay off her student loans and she can borrow whatever else she needs for school, she has to pay you back but it will be interest free? Thats a good compromise I should think.

I think this is a worth while investment.", "What a huge gift you would be giving to your children if you helped.  It would be a huge gift to the mother of your children.  I understand you will take care of your kids and financially it will be easy for you.  This will never be easy for your ex.  Her body will be changed at a minimum, and it will never be the same, typically the lions share of the parenting and sleepless nights will fall on her.  You are not the asshole for not doing it but it would be a gift to your children to do it.", "NTA. You owe her nothing. She doesn\u2019t deserve an award or anything for doing what a mother is morally and legally required to do.", "As long as you provide for your kids NTA.", "I might get hate for this but who cares lol.. Her university fees are not your responsibility, your not her ATM or cash cow and her family need to back off. I find it hilarious that her family are trying to guilt you into paying her university fees like wtf is that about, you owe them nothing. You just focus on being a good dad and provider for your twins and let there mother figure her own shit out NTA!", "NTA. Nope. No. Noughtta. Not at all.\nYou\u2019re only obligation is to your children, not their mother. \nThe audacity that she has asking for money to only benefit herself and then throwing a tantrum when she didn\u2019t like your answer is just mind blowing.\nNTA a billion times over. \nAlso- Make sure that she can\u2019t get access to your money in the event something happens to you though.", "You know, I came really close to saying N-A-H because it's absolutely, 100% true that it is not your legal or even technically your ethical responsibility to help Evie out financially beyond whatever court-mandated child support you are required to give her.\n\nBut I can't do it. Because honestly, **YTA.**\n\nThis sub isn't a legal sub; and it's not \"Is This My Ethical Responsibility?\" It's called \"Am I The Asshole\", and honestly, no matter how I look at it, you really are the asshole in this situation.\n\nBecause this isn't about your relationship with Evie, or how much you hate her. Your whole \"I can't believe we have kids\" is irrelevant because YOU DO have kids. That you wouldn't in a million years want her to be your girlfriend or to be in a relationship with her doesn't matter anymore. She is the mother of your children, and she will be for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd so while, again, it is absolutely true that IT IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to help her with her tuition when you can easily afford to . . . what I keep coming back to is that THE PRIORITY HERE SHOULD BE YOUR KIDS, AND IT IS IN YOUR CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS, in the long term, for Evie to have a post-secondary education. In fact, it's in your best interests as well! Here's why:\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with people opting to pursue trades or other work if they're not interested in post-secondary education, Evie is ready and willing to get a degree, and the objective reality is that more education Evie has, the better her job prospects are in the long run, and the more benefits your kids get from being raised by a well-educated, literate mother. Study after study shows that parents with degrees navigate the school system more easily for their own kids, are better able to support them through their schooling, and she is also likely to get a better paying job meaning that she won't have to rely on you to help support them later on. She is less likely to have to take a job working long hours that will leave her exhausted and grumpy, and more likely to have a career with flexibility, that will let her spend more time with your kids in their early years. The benefits are endless. Your sister suggesting that \"if she can't afford it she should drop out\" isn't just hateful, it's potentially detrimental to your kids. Do you WANT them being raised half the time in a household with a mother who was forced to give up her education? Is that the kind of support you think your kids deserve?\n\nYTA because, like most 19-year-olds, you're not thinking of the long-term consequences. You're so busy being childish and petty that you aren't prioritising your kids. It would be different if you couldn't afford it, but you're saying that you can. Easily. So be the bigger person and help their mother, not because you OWE it to her, but because you owe it to yourself and to your children.", "NTA. F she cannot afford college then she shouldn\u2019t attend. Just because you have money doesn\u2019t mean anything. If she signs something for a loan then fine but if you give in now that will continue for the next 18 years of your daughters life with their mom constantly expecting you to provide for her. You only need to provide for your daughters, not their mom.", "NTA what would have been her plan if you didn\u2019t have the money? Part of me feels like she did this on purpose to get you to pay for her education. My mom raised me and my brother as a single mother at the age of 18 & eventually got her college degree. She never demanded for someone else to pay for her education.", "NTA. You\u2019re young - even if it \u201cwon\u2019t make a dent,\u201d you\u2019ll definitely come to use that money at some point. You already share custody of your daughters and in regards to Evie, that\u2019s enough. You don\u2019t need to support their mother especially if you guys aren\u2019t together. If she chose to go to a top university, she also knew how much it would cost her to attend.", "NTA, her studies arent your responsability. If she cant afford the kids, go to court and figure it out. All the comments saying \"Youd let your kids be poor 50% of the time\" are bs, thats why custody is split or given when one of the parents cannot take care of the kids.\n\nAlso, Please use protection , having a kid with someone you despise AT 19 isnt the best way to start your adult life", "NTA - She was struggling to pay before, she can't use the kid as a cash cow. You'll owe whatever the court says you owe.\n\nIn all seriousness though... is it too late to consider giving the kid up for adoption? Giving up your parental rights? You're both young, and quite frankly a bit immature if you're getting drunk enough to hate-fuck. It sounds like co-parenting is going to be a nightmare that screws the kid up for life. I'm also not getting a I wanna be a dad vibe.", "NTA it\u2019s not your problem, unfortunately for her. She is being unfair and demanding things of you that she has no right to, legally or morally. Continue doing what you do to care for the girls but that\u2019s as far as your obligation goes", "Nta ultimately it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for her education, if IF you wanted to be nice to could agree to a loan a proper loan with repayment plan. \n\nShe could also transfer to a cheaper uni, why an earth did her parents send her to the U.K. with no means to cover the fee\u2019s. \n\nNobody would be expecting a rich mother to pay for her baby daddies education if you reversed this. \n\nGet your money tied up legally for if the worst happens to you that it\u2019s in trust for your daughters with your sisters as those authorised to access it for their needs only and not under the mothers trust.", "NTA.

Your responsibilities for higher education start and stop with your girls. You are inder no obligation to fund the higher education of their mother. That is her responsibility alone. And no, that's NOT how it's done in the states.", "NA \n\ndont give her ! if you start giving her now you are in for a hell of more request! she will ask for all she need house and more always with the excuse of '' helping your druthers'' \n\nyour sisters are right, if she dont have the money then she have to chose another path\n\nif you hadn't had babys with her she would had the same issue. you are not her personal credit card", "NTA-  this is money for her education not your children. She doesn\u2019t have the rights to your money", "NTA", "People saying YTA, the main reason they are saying it is because she won\u2019t get an education therefore won\u2019t have money to provide fo the kids.

It is not his responsibility AT ALL to pay for a woman who he hates and vice versa to have a higher education, especially not with the excuse that he has the money to. You want her to go to uni?

Those girls are going to grow up with a father and aunts slagging off their mother, using their wealth to bully others and being handed off to a nanny because daddy does not really to care for them.\n\nThis is not about the legality of your situation but your complete apathy towards a young woman who carried a high risk pregnancy while having to put her education on hold in a foreign country with few resources at her disposal while her antagonistic ex and his sisters harassed her. You should have used contraception and she is a fool for bringing two babies into the world before she is able to care for them with a degree and career.

The same would be true for the MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN who has 50/50 custody.\n\nYou aren't legally obligated, but you know your children will have a better life if their mother is also well-educated.

Both of you for having kids together when you can't get along. \n\nI do want you to consider something though.  You are going to be tied to this woman for the rest of your lives.

If she has to quit school, her career choices, options for where to live, ability to contribute to the costs of raising them, and her general well being will be significantly limited.

That you care more about making dure their mom doesn't get any of your money than you do about their quality of life.\n\nSo, while I completely agree that you aren't obligated to pay for her education, I do think that you are still looking at this situation through the eyes of a single 19 year old, and not through the eyes of a father of two.

What is wrong with people these days!! He said he would make sure the kids are taken care of,, shoot he probably will make a trust fund for them and he already said how much he takes care of them, no one and I mean no one should be pressuring him into helping her education.", "THIS !  Important for OP to read! \n\nI completely agree, even if my judgement would be different. (ESH) Because I find the way the mother and her family is pressuring OP very entitled, maybe even taking advantage. \n\nAs you say, it would be best for OP and for his kids, but the mother is not entitles to his money, yet they act like she is.", "This is a really excellent point!", "Yeah look for legal advices also get info on what to do about the harassment, they can't do that!

That usually helps to cut out the emotions.

Are you obligated to help her pay for uni? No. If she has a degree from Oxford will that significantly increase her ability to get a decent job and not rely on you after graduation? Yes. If she drops out, might she take your daughters back with her or even return to the US? Maybe. If you consider all these options now, could you come up with some sort of deal with your lawyer whereby you help her out (not saying pay for everything, but think if some intermediate solutions) in return for her agreeing not to move away or arrange a private loan via a solicitor. I get you hate each other. I get you are two antagonistic teenagers but rather than taking swipes at each other, you both need to play the long game for the sake of your children. A mediator may be very helpful on this scenario too.", "It IS difficult to deal with! The fact you acknowledge this is showing you have a good heart! \n\nA way of looking at things that helps me when deling with nasty people getting their way is this:  What do I find more important? \nIn your case:  your children having a well educated happy mother, and seeing how kind their dad is? Or you letting her know you do not like her? \n\nSimply put, try this mantra: **\"The love for my children will always outweigh the hate I have for their mom\"**\n\nOh, and if you *do* decide to help out, find a way that money goes directly to the school, so she can't misuse it for anything else...\n\n\nEdit:typo", "Is it a better life for his kids though?

Child support probably will be ordered by courts if it gets there but that's for the kids and not for her", "Because assuming OP gives his kids the quality of stuff typically given to children of his wealth (expensive schools, tuition, branded clothes, expensive hobbies) then it's unfair to expect the mother to cough up half when she can't afford the same lifestyle", "Custody only refers to decision making and not find spent with parent. Even at 50/50 time many places require child support when there is an income difference", "Kids with mothers with cars are better off than kids with mothers without cars. Doesn't mean OP should go buy the mother a car. Kids with mothers that own property are better off than kids with mothers that rent. Doesn't mean OP should go buy the mother a house.\n\nThere's a cut off where it's less for the kids and more for the mother and that's what education is when OP has enough money to financially support the kids. If she can't afford an education then that's her problem. Even if they went to court the court would order child support and not for OP to give the mother a scholarship.\n\nI'm curious if people would say the same if the genders were flipped because all the posts like this have been about rich fathers and poor mothers", "You\u2019re nta, but the way you speak of her makes it clear you are not a kind person.", "Why is she paying her student loans off now?

If its university fees, then I would want to know what her and her parents plan was to pay it and why that isn't currently happening? Same for her general living costs.

Why does him not giving money to somebody he doesn't even like make him petty? \n\nAgreed, it takes two to tango. TWO. It was her responsibility as well, when she decided to have sex knowing it could result in pregnancy. He is responsible for his kids, not their mother. I was struggling with money so I decided to go to a cheaper college, why can't she if that's so important for her (no hate for wanting education). \n\nAlso the part about \"is he going to pay for her to rent a nicer place in the future?\" WHY TF WOULD HE DO THAT!? There's plenty of kids who's parents are not togather who go to one parent's house which is a little nicer and to the other parent's who doesn't have that nice of a place. It doesn't make them hate one parent and love the other more or be uncomfortable at a place and comfortable at the other.

Mother of his child or not this is her issue.\n\n>Separating the children from heir mother to live with their father just because he is rich is a horrible plan.\n\nExcept this isn't some greedy asshole withholding the child until child support is paid, it's literal infants being financially supported by the stable parent while the financially unstable parent gets her footing. Decent co-parents do this sort of thing all the time, and if OP is fair it should hardly prevent her on demand access to her kids when she wants to see them, but it would relieve a significant financial burden from her shoulders until she can hold it."]}
