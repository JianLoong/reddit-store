You\u2019re a great dad, and your son is so fortunate to have you. But your wife\u2019s behavior is quite concerning\u2026what else will she fail to protect your son from?", "Show her this post, what your wife did or rather didn\u2019t do is unacceptable. She needs to stand up for your child", "If someone I thought I wanted to marry made fun of my nephew and berated my sis and bil, they wouldn\u2019t have to say anything in their son\u2019s or their own defense because I\u2019d be all over it, letting fianc\u00e9 know I didn\u2019t approve and also my nephew and his friend steve are cool but that we need to cancel our orders while I pay for my family\u2019s food and we go have a serious talk about whether we should cancel the wedding.  Your bil is a jerk for not setting his intended straight about that immediately. \n\nNTA op, but your wife needs to know you draw a hard line at supporting your son.  If she can\u2019t be with you in backing him up against bullies including family members, you\u2019ve gotta have a hard think about that."]}
