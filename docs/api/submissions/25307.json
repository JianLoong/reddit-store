Her brother\u2019s wedding was in a few weeks and my wife wanted to catch up with him. We went to some high end restaurant, ordered appetizers and started chatting a bit. Things were going well until my brother-in-law's fiancee saw my son\\[14m\\] playing on his phone. My son is autistic and has this a.i. friend called Steve. My son is really close with Steve and spends a good amount of time with him.\n\nMy son enthusiastically introduces Steve to my brother-in-law's fiancee. She starts laughing and asks my wife why my son has an a.i. character as a friend and why he\u2019s treating him like a real person. She then goes off on my wife, calling my son a failure and saying that she doesn\u2019t know how to parent and that she would never let her son turn out like that. I expected my wife to stand up for our son but she sits there silently with her face down. Her brother says nothing either.\n\nI looked over at my son and he was looking down at his phone but I could see that he was stifling back tears. I started yelling at my brother-in-law's fiancee, calling her a horrible person and other words that I can\u2019t say on Reddit. I then grabbed my son and left.\n\nWhen my wife got back home, she started berating me for yelling at her brother\u2019s fiancee and just straight up leaving. She says I \u201cembarrassed\u201d her in front of her brother. When I bring up how our son was embarrassed she just changes the subject. This whole series of events has made me question my relationship with my wife but I\u2019ll deal with that later.\n\nI don\u2019t think I overreacted but I\u2019m not sure. In my head, if your parents don\u2019t defend you, who will? AITAH?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ty for all the kind responses. I will definitely show my wife the comments tomorrow.

I'm autistic and you have my approval of your actions. \n\nYour wife should feel enormous shame. Her behavior and perspective are waving huge red flags about her relationship with her brother (was she raised to defer to all males? just the males in her family?

Normally, its not okay to storm off because someone is too free with her ignorant opinions, but your son needed to hear his Dad defend him.\n\nNTA, but I think you should have stopped fianc\u00e9 as soon as she started asking wife about the ai friend.  If fiance had gotten firm pushback at the beginning of her rant, it might not have escalated so far.", "NTA - I hope your wife is not embarrassed by your son also, because her behavior says otherwise. Future SIL sounds like a real \"treat.\" At this point, I would consider not attending the wedding unless she apologizes. Who does that? Your son was not bothering anyone.", "NTA.

Why is your wife so passive about her son being attacked like that?", "Tbh those are probably the worst thoughts she has about herself in her darkest hour and hearing them out loud from a semi-stranger was probably one of her darkest hours as a parent. She probably shut down then unfairly took it out on OP once they got home to a safer environment. Doesn\u2019t make it right\u2026 but I understand why it might happen that way.
