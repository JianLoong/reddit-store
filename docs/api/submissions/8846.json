We all have at least one contact that is constantly sharing their health scares... or telling the world about their very ill neighbor and asking for prayers in their name. \n\nNot saying sometimes it's not sincere, but it's super common to see people clearly doing it for the attention, even if indirectly.", "Damn. Sorry man. Seems like a whole another r/offmychest post", "The husband should 100% go. \n\nAs for the OP, I'm torn, because they claim it was their friend too.\n\nLast year I woke up to a text from my aunt telling me I needed to sign off on my Father's cremation.\n\nWhen I asked about a funeral, they told me it was just for \"family\".\n\nWhen I brought this up to the funeral home, they informed me that generally, they won't bar people from a funeral unless they feel like they need to.\n\nEmotions are high and people are grieving. I can understand why OP is upset. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel like creating scenes where you aren't wanted, especially at a funeral is in poor taste.\n\nIt sucks all around and my heart goes out to all of them. Unfortunately a lot of folks appear to use tragedies like this in an attempt to punish people.", "Thank you, me too. It made a terrible thing so much more painful. The disbelief, the denial, the fear,  the panicked phone calls and text messages I sent and then knowing who was pounding at the door, and why, before I even opened it. There is never a \"good\" way to get that news but it sure as hell should never be while scrolling through Facebook.", "I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll post selfies on her social media so all her friends can see her grieving.", "That is a very good point. I read that but I guess it didn't sink in. That is super fucked up AH behavior", "Takes of fun out of it a bit, doesn't it? Kinda thought it would be obvious. Oh well", "Yup. This post is yet another way for her to get attention from Joe\u2019s death.\n\nYTA, op.", "I get the feeling that OP never apologized to the widow over any of these blowups.", "I bet she\u2019s telling friends who don\u2019t know Joe or his wife and leaving vital details out", "Just think about level of AH has to be for the grieving widow to specifically exclude her from the funeral. I can't even imagine.", "Exactly. Tell me you are a narcissist without telling me you are a narcissist \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!", "To me it was obvious but you ruffled some feathers haha"]}
