I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like it or think it should be different. That\u2019s just how it\u2019s done. You have a coupon? A gift card? You tip on the menu price. The waiter didn\u2019t have to do any less work because the meal was free. This is a slightly different situation than the coupon, but close enough that the diner tips on the menu price.", "Clearly not so much a rule that the other servers followed it. Note how every coworker was also shocked at the asshole server\u2019s response?", "I have also waited tables! It is beyond ridiculous to think OP is the asshole. This situation should be treated like the manager is the person who picked up the bill. \n\nFor a free coupon yes the customer should tip, but not in this situation.", "Waiting for the first news that it should be 40 or 50% ;)  \nSome will say inflation and high costs of life (which is true for most parts of the world), but if we are using % for tips, it's already included...", "Because you take breaks when it isn't busy. Some places they don't give you a technical break time off the clock. You just take a few minutes when ever you can when it's not busy.", "The problem is, it is almost insulting to the manager to tip/offer money when you are offered a meal for free. The notion of this person getting mad at OP is beyond ridiculous. The employee should have complained to the manager and the employee is the asshole for this. The manager was clear that the manager was paying. The person paying is responsible for the tip.", "So in other words, a server can and will be taxed on no earnings at all if the customer didn't get a tip?  And how would the tax dept know how much to tax?", "Crazy.", "I'm sorry that is just fucked.", "Adding: \u201creported income of the restaurant.\u201d So if the restaurant did 2k in sales that day, and you\u2019re on payroll, the govt decides that your income is 20% of (2k prorated by your hours) and assumes that every single person who spent money there tipped you 20%, whether it\u2019s on the receipt or not. \n\nIf you have a shitty day, and a table stiffs you, you\u2019re tipping out to the barbacks and maybe a bartender as well, so after taxes, it can often cost them money to work.", "I never said the OP was an AH. I just explained that things are different here than in other countries. If you have waited tables in the US you should know better. But again, I'm not here to argue with you. I made my statement and that's it. You can move on and argue with someone else now because I have better things to do.", "And you order food, a meal, and pay for it, that a coworker brings to you?", "The taxes would come out of their 2.13 an hour pay check instead of their tips. The tips you add at the end of a shift into the system to let them know you met minimum wage. If you put into the system that you didn't meet minimum wage during your shift then the business will add the difference on to your check. But this is all depending on where you work and who you work for. Every place is different.", "I believe a certain amount of tip income is assumed because it often doesn\u2019t get reported to the tax authorities the way regular wages do.", "We live in the bad place", "Yah. We know. Try telling it to the great swaths of humanity here who\u2019ve been brainwashed to believe that it\u2019s normal and fine.", "Yes you do. Or at least tip the cook if you don't cook the food yourself. You tip the server especially if you choose to take up a spot in their section so they aren't losing money.", "$2.13 an hour.  Just sneezing costs more than that.", "That I completely understand.", "And can I just say, the serving sizes in America is unbelievable.  If restraunts continued to charge what they charge, and halved what they served, what they save in portion sizes, they could pay their staff a far, far better wage.", "Well if you\u2019re sitting a table and ordering food, obviously you should tip, you\u2019re not saying anything I haven\u2019t.", "If you are a good enough server, you can leave a shift with at least 2-300 in tips and that is way over minimum wage. Holidays you make a ton more because your regulars will end up giving you 50-100 tips and some even brings gifts for you.", "Wow.  Mind blowing.", "Ya it really just depends on how good of a server you are, what shift you work, and how busy it is during the shift plus how many actual tipping customers you have. I have worked with some servers who were crappy servers and the guests would end up tipping me instead of their server because I would wait on them when ever their own server wouldn't and deeply apologize for their crappy service. I even had guests come in and ask for my section specifically for that reason.", "NTA but I always tip on free food!", "NTA. The manager should have tipped especially if they were sitting with you. \n\nBut tipping culture is weird. I probably would have just asked for them to go or left a few bucks for goodwill / in case it was some kind of weird test.", "YTA. Despite the fact that your meal was free, the waiter did his job. If you guys hadn't have been seated at that table, someone else would have, and they would have been expected to tip. If anything, you should have been more inclined to tip since you didn't have to pay for your meal.", "NTA. Servers should have a regular salary. This is so dumb. How were you supposed to know he was expecting a tip when the manager gave you free burgers?", "Well. 15,20, or 25% of 0 is still zero, so no.", "NTA. He didn't give you free food, the manager gave you free food. Tipping is such a dumb concept and I'm glad I'm not from America.", ">I gave y'all free food\n\nWell, no. The waiter didn't give them free burgers. The restaurant gave them free burgers. To be more technical, the manager gave them free burgers. He didn't pay for the burgers himself.", "soft YTA\n\nsouth american here who worked in restaurants in the US... tipping in the US was the hardest cultural norm to acclimate to, but the logic here is, if the server brought you the burgers, and you were sitting at a regular table, that server had to do their job - order and fetch the food, clean and reset the table for the next customer.\n\nso it would be customary to leave the equivalent tip for the full priced meal\n\nI worked BOH, and we could eat at the restaurant on our days off at a discount... but I always tipped cuz if you are sitting at the table, the server has to do their job and tips are part of their compensation.", "Ugh I feel like people are not going to like my answer\u2026\n\nWas the manager with you the whole time? Like was this an interview over a meal type of situation? If so then I would totally expect the manager, the person who is supposedly treating you, to be the one to compensate the employee including the tip. \n\nIf the manager just insisted you order and then dipped I would have tipped *but* only out of courtesy and would have felt a bit awkward. Not for the service but because I would have felt pressured into tipping since I now don\u2019t *know* if it\u2019s expected or not and I would feel bad accidentally stiffing the waiter. Basically I would have been a bit peeved at the manager.\n\nHowever in the end I think it was wrong for the employee to confront you and their frustration should be directed at the manager. \n\nNTA", "Because it was your manager who offered those burgers, it should\u2019ve been your manager who tipped the waiter, not you guys. You\u2019re NTA", "YTA in the US but NTA in Australia", "NTA - Tell them you tipped exactly 20% of the total.", "NTA \"I gave y'all free food\" What?! No! The manager gave them free food, you just served it to them, you didn't paid for it or prepared it! Sure he handed it over, so he \"gave\" it to them but come on. He behaves as they should thank him that they got free food... And well... 29% of 0$ is 0$ tip.", "While I vote NTA. I still think youd be better off just explaining the situation to the person instead of asking for judgement. It's not hard to say \"hey my bad manager offered free food, didn't mean to\" besides You have to work with this person not us but that's just my opinion", "We have a standard wage, not a tipped wage in my state, and tip culture is STILL like this.", "they do at dick\u2019s burgers and full benefits, burgers, fries and shakes are all cheaper than mcdonalds", "Why is that their responsibility and not the managers though? If that's happening all the time then I suppose it is a problem but that's something to bring up with management", "Lmao.... now they are demanding tips for takeout too.", "Not to mention better tasting as well.", "You know tips are not obligatory, don\u2019t you?", "In the meantime maybe not put the blame on customers?", "The fact there's a guide on \"how to, as a guest, make sure your waiter doesn't starve because their boss can't be bothered to pay them properly\" is fucking sad.", "Just because someone writes it doesn't make it gospil.", "Care to elaborate?", "He ran two burgers out when it was more than likely incredibly dead, because that\u2019s when interviews happen. I think he\u2019ll be ok.", "It\u2019s not about what employee gets paid, it\u2019s about paying forward for free meal. Of course, if you don\u2019t appreciate that free meal, don\u2019t tip (well). Personally I appreciate free meals, and love for it to be repeated (by making sure waiter (staff) are also happy I got free meal. I\u2019ve been comped often, and many times, those who make that call,appreciate me treating their staff well. If I would have paid $20 for my meal, and it ends up free, of course I\u2019m happy to leave $6+ tip, instead of $20 plus $3 in tip (that\u2019s $6 instead of $23)", "About and beyond is covered in free meal, that\u2019s why I tip well on free stuff. If you\u2019re paying, 30% would be nuts, but it\u2019s free, so giving a double tip on what I would have paid, is spreading out the windfall", "If it\u2019s a free meal, what\u2019s the problem? I\u2019m guessing getting comped isn\u2019t something that gets repeated for you. I know of a couple of places that comp me on the regular, can you guess why it occurs often? Do you think it\u2019s because staff is happy when manager/owner takes care of my bill? If you never want to be comped repeatedly, by all means, be frugal when your meal is free", "I 100% agree with your sentiment, but as someone who\u2019s worked in the restaurant industry majority of restaurants do not follow this labor law unfortunately. Can\u2019t really do much except report them and move on, and hope they\u2019re investigated.", "Right?! This was the interview, the part where you make a good impression. When someone insists on giving you a free meal, they may find it rude if you turn them down. They left the house with no plans on spending money, they probably didn\u2019t even have cash!", "Look at it this way, \n\nThe manager was the one that offered the burgers for free, yeah? So, the manager is the one that, in a sense, 'paid' for them. \n\nShouldn't that mean the employee should be asking the manager?", "I\u2019ll happily accept being wrong because that\u2019s fucking ridiculous lol. The manager insisted, and I understand them not wanting to feel rude by turning down her offer. They didn\u2019t leave the house with plans to spend money, shit they may not of even had cash.", "Not like a coupon in any way. Totally different scenario", "New kne on me, never heard of this. Just make it up?", "Absolutely this. It was not the waiter's choice to comp you. The waiter worked for you and their pay is basically the tips they earn. Even as a guest of the owner, tipping on the value of what you eat is the thoughtful thing to do.", "I kinda want to see people try to say that 40 or 50% tips should be the norm. Let's see how many people take the \"if you can't tip, you shouldn't go out to eat\" advise to heart and servers start to lose their jobs becasue of the loss of business and oversaturation of workers."]}
