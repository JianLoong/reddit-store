If that stuff doesn't bother you,  who the heck are they to say that it should? They must be bored to have come up with something so petty. \n\nAt the end of the day,  they have the relationship they've cultivated with MIL. If they're feeling guilty or ashamed about that then it's on them to make changes.  Not to ask you to ruin your relationship with MIL.", "Of course NTA.  Tell them you've respected their boundaries, and they should return the courtesy by respecting yours.", "NTA - \n\nThem: We each get to set boundaries based on what we are each comfortable with because we know what is best for ourselves and our families.\n\nAlso them: You have to set the boundaries that we tell you to set regardless of what you feel is best for you and your family. \n\nI get that you not having boundaries makes it harder for them to establish their own. But oh the irony of them telling you that you have to live your live a certain way because they want to make their own choices!", "NTA.  You just have a different open relationship with her\u2026 if they don\u2019t like too bad.\n\nLike I said in another thread it that\u2019s a village to raise a child, why alienate your MIL or future MIL.", "If they don't like being compared to you, that's a conversation they need to have with MIL and not you. You have your own relationship with her, and they are responsible for their own relationships. It's really bizarre that they want you to change to suit their boundaries with her. That doesn't make sense. NTA", "NTA I have a similar dynamic with my sister who is very easygoing and lets my parents largely do anything they want without showing frustration of complaining unless something goes really wrong. In contrast, I\u2019m big on privacy and autonomy as a teen and adult. Guess who my parents moved to be closer to and help with childcare, pet care (even a dog which they are very much not fans of), laundry, cleaning, grocery shopping and any number of other things? Not me. But that\u2019s not my sister\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not like she is faking it to make me less likeable in comparison. She genuinely doesn\u2019t mind when they do things that would drive me crazy, which is hard for me to understand, but again - not her fault.  Your SIL have to decide what matters more - the boundaries or being on her good side.  I picked boundaries and while it hurts to see that they enjoy her so much more, I also know I\u2019d be miserable with them rearranging my closets and throwing away my so-called \u201cclutter\u201d", "NTA, if you don't care you don't care....tell them it's obvious you have a spine because you are using it with them that they are the ones out of line not the MIL.  If they don't want to see you than that's their choice but don't blame it on you.  Tell them, you aren't going to let them bully you.  Sorry if MIL compares me to you; that's an issue you should bring up with her not me.  I'm sorry you guys are too scared to grow a spine and stand up to her....lol, I kind of find this funny because they are hypocrites.", "\"MIL, I wish you wouldn't compare me to your other DILs in a way that makes them feel bad. It's really not fair to them or to me...just because my boundaries are in a different place, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them having their boundaries. It really puts me in an awkward position.\"\n\nNTA, and they were utterly out-of-line for 'confronting' you like that. You are not responsible for your MIL's actions, and unless you have been disparaging the other DILs to her, you don't deserve any of the blame for their frustrations.\n\nThat being said, it would be a kindness if you talk to your MIL. She's been an AH to them (loudly/repeatedly complaining about the rules is a fairly transparent attempt to reopen negotiations, even if she ultimately follows the rules).", "NTA.  But it would be a kindness to hear them out about the most important boundaries that they agree on and to help you MIL see they aren't being unreasonable.  I do this when mil is unhappy about sil.  I try to show another side to it rather than agreeing sil is unreasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get having a MIL who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries and complains about you. It\u2019s not fun. But that is NOT your problem or your fault. Your fellow DILs can find a different outlet for their frustration. It\u2019s literally not your problem. \n\nI personally would not be ok with the things you describe, but I\u2019m not you. Just keep doing your thing. Don\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA. You explained it well here, explain it to them.\n\nTell them that you do have a spine and if MIL crosses any of your boundaries, MIL will get told to stop it. It's just that MIL hasn't crossed any of your boundaries yet, because they're looser than husband's other siblings' seem to be. You just don't mind a lot of the stuff that they do mind.", "NTA - people have different boundaries.", "NTA \n\nSoooooo they want you to set boundaries to make them feel better about them having soooo many boundaries. \n\nHahahahahahahaha\n\nThat\u2019s funny! \n\nThat\u2019s the thing with boundaries, some people find some of them unreasonable! So they want to be unreasonable too so they feel better. I can\u2019t even", "Info: is the problem that you have different needs or that MIL is pushing their boundaries by comparing you to them? I wonder if MIL is being passive aggressive ass. Is there someone who could have calm discussion about this with you and give more perspective?", "So lay down the law and make it clear to MiL that if she uses your easy-going nature as a club to bully your sisters-in-law, things are gonna change. \n\nMake it clear to the sisterhood that you're not going to change to suit them, and that your relationship to your MiL isn't something they get a veto over, just as you wouldn't dream of interfering in theirs. Let them know that you have told MiL you don't appreciate being compared to anyone, that you don't want to get dragged into their boundary struggles, and that you have told all parties to Leave You Out.\n\nNTA.", "So you're NTA. They've clearly all been bitching about you behind your back, which is pathetic! Nothing wrong with being respectful, which is what you have been doing.  That MIL might be using you as a positive example is no reason for them to pull you down, they should be stepping up.", "NTA\n\nAnd I think I would have a nice chat with MIL about this\n\nMIL should be your best friend from now on.  That way you'll get all the free babysitting and grandma spoiling your kids can handle", "NTA. You not being a rigid, controlling person isn\u2019t some character flaw.", "NtA. You\u2019re just being you. They being them. Not your problem your MIL likes you for being you. Petty SIL", "NTA, they are all behaving like they have some god given right to be difficult and treat your MIL as someone who must kiss their asses. They're just upset to see that being a decent person and not nitpicking can result in harmony!", "NTA. I\u2019m for the boundaries that your SILs have. And that\u2019s ok for them as it is ok for you to do you. As long as everyone is authentic to what they want. The AH is MIL for guiding them by comparing them to you. That puts a negative pressure on what they want to do for their own family. So if you want to have a decent relationship ship with them. Perhaps advocate for them as MIL is being manipulative", "NTA and it is great that you get along with your MIL. we rarely see that! ignore them and keeping hanging out with your MIL because it does sound like you guys get along and that is always a good thing.", "Nta, you have different comfort levels and preferences. mils bitching is on MIL not you.", "Nta \u2026. The jealousy is huge green eyes SIL\u2019s I get why you have a good relationship with your MIL she is the only mother figure you have a has probably been a huge support to you especially after having children do not let them interfere with what you and MIL have most people would want that relationship not a JUST NO MIL", "I love how basically only the wives are upset and everyone else in this family is like, \"lol, what did y'all expect, miss me with your drama.\"\n\nLike, look, I get it boundaries and all that. However, if you put up a million barriers and make it impossible for your in law to have a relationship with the kids(no info on these womens own parents, but I've seen enough posts to say it varies and favourites get played) than don't be pissy when your MIL likes the more easy going DIL. That's a consequence that can occur in these situations.\n\nFrankly, the fact that they engaged in an intervention, which on its own is exceedingly over dramatic, makes them look excessively full of themselves. They needed to \"help you\" to \"save you\", so they could stop hearing comparisons of themselves. Such upstanding individuals...\n\nNTA", "NTA you've respected their boundaries they need to learn to do the same.", "I wouldn't say that OP doesn't have boundaries - it's just her boundaries are \"I don't really care\" and MiL hasn't crossed into \"do not want\" territory yet.\n\nBut I agree with the rest, the SiLs aound controlling.", "I'm in your sister's position in the family, my parents have respected the very few boundaries I've drawn and have helped out with things even if I haven't asked them to. My sister resents me for this and recently used the phrase \"you bow down to them\" while accusing them if favouritism which made me sad for her...\n\nMy parents are a bit old fashioned but fairly open minded to persuasion and I feel like my sister could have a much better relationship with them if she met them where they were and didn't get mad that they aren't the kinds of parents her friends had. \ud83e\udd72", "Is the MIL openly comparing them or are the SILs doing the comparing?", "Yep. You get to have whatever boundaries you want. But you also should back up other people in their boundaries and shut down the comparing.", "Good thoughts. You sound like a nice person.", "Is the MIL bullying any of them because OP is chill? Because it sounds like this is just an issues between thr SILs.", "Im wondering if mil complains to her sons about the dil with boundaries. Mention op isnt like that. Why cant they", "The OP isn't clear, and couched the passage in the passive voice, making it even more unclear, but the sisters are feeling compared to the OP, and if not by MiL, whom?", "The way I interpreted it was the SILs were comparing themselves and each other to OP."]}
