As long as your own patterns don't allow fun money to ever cut into expenses like rent, utilities, etc then he's making a big deal out of your request. He could have just said no thank you.

Asking a partner to borrow money that you intend to pay back - especially a small amount - should not subject you to his opinions about what you would do with that money. You could have just kept him in the dark about it but really that shouldn't be necessary. He shouldn't be using this temporary thing he can hold over you to control your choices. It would be one thing to be like \"Sure, but for what it's worth I've always preferred you with shorter nails.\" but this response, especially the \"I'm teaching you about priorities\" comment makes me question his respect for you or his take on equality in a relationship.", "I\u2019m going to start this with NAH.

Are you OP's pathetic boyfriend?", "Because half of these people have never been in a real relationship.", "This is how *normal* relationships work lol. These nickel and dime posts are a trip", "This was after he said he wasn't interested and she started with the *'technically wouldnt be paying for them because i planned on giving it back'*\n\nIn other words, she wasn't taking no for an answer.  She's acting entitled, entitled that he has to justify not wanting to pay for something silly like nails to a person who has been unemployed and is broke.", "If he'd just said no it would have been fine, but because he started with I don't like nails on you why would I do that, then oh I was just teaching you priorities... yes he's an asshole.", "That's...what they said. And what the top level comment on this thread said...", "Your an idiot", "And literally one person didn\u2019t disagree with that.  If you read my comment, you\u2019ll see I said it is *best* to get them removed at the shop.  Ffs.  \n\nI have removed my own nails and had them removed at the shop.  It was hard to cut through the acrylic and make them look decent with my tools, but when the nail tech did it, my natural nails looked really nice afterward.  \n\nI didn\u2019t say she *has to* go get them removed.", "Her statement is not contradictory though.  She seems to be saying she wants longer nails to get cut down to shorter nails.", "Who expects someone to look 10/10 at home?", "I was going to pay you back.....", "Yes thanks for saying what I said but longer.", "You don't need to cut them! You file them off. When they get close to the natural nail, you then use acetone.", "you said it after two other people on this comment chain already did. Why on earth would you think it's reasonable to have that attitude to someone else saying it.", "Well no, it wasn't him just saying no was it? He insulted her in the process", "Yeah, but it takes forever and it always looks bad after the fact.", "Who has attitude?", "So no he\u2019s not an asshole for refusing but is for how he said it. Is what I said", "No he's an asshole for insulting her... Not for refusing"]}
