It\u2019s not just OPs room and he isn\u2019t the only one who has a right to feel comfortable.  His roommates probably have to walk on eggshells around him because of him throwing his temper tantrums.  I\u2019ve been around enough college guys to know that this is how they eat when in their rooms.  They feel relaxed and eat how they want to.  Maybe dorm life is not for OP and he needs to find somewhere else to live.", "Bro I\u2019m sure he sounds your voice annoying but does he abusive yell at you?", "And you can leave the freaking room when he is eating.  This is a you problem not his problem.  He has just as much right to be in that room as you do and news flash you are not the dictator of the room just because you think you are.", "Call me stupid, but how is this immature? He is acknowledging, respecting and obeying the advice of somebody else. A little too theatrically for my tastes but it's better than not.", "I have to wear noose canceling headphones and ear plugs because of it too", "You being disturbed at the situation doesn\u2019t mean you get to tell him how to eat. It\u2019s not your place and you have no authority over other people\u2019s eating.", "My dad chews gum and I have to be in another universe until he\u2019s done.", "I mean like what are you suppose do at that point? I kind of this that maybe I salivate more while chewing or something.", "How does a person control their snoring?", "They don't. It's 100% a me problem", "I feel like I shouldn't have had to scroll this far to see misophonia being mentioned. Do you have it, too?", "Breathing sounds get me. Like while watching TV and you can hear people breathing. I tend to hyper focus on it but I don't comment on it. Everyone has to breath", "I had someone try giving the same bullshit excuse. He even tried teaching his kids(aka my siblings) that. Yeah I think the fuck not.", "It oozes sarcasm that screams immature asshole.", "Enjoy never making friends while you\u2019re in college", "Depends on the issue causing it-- bad snoring can be a symptom of something more serious and often requires medical intervention if it can be fixed, but the solutions can be pretty invasive, so if the only issue is snoring, the answer is usually just suck it up.", "I was hoping there was a solution. I snore and it drives my boyfriend crazy. Which drives me crazy because he wakes me up. I find sleeping in a sitting up position helps but it\u2019s not too comfortable of a way to sleep. Thanks for your input.", "I get it. It's a tough thing to live with - it's neurological, and it basically triggers a \"fight or flight\" response in those who have it. I keep headphones handy whenever possible just in case, because they really have helped me.", "Talk to your doctor about a sleep study - snoring like that could be a sign of sleep apnoea, which can cause serious health issues if it's left untreated.", "My mister does. He gets annoying about it sometimes but realizes that he is in control of his responses to unpleasant stimuli, and he has to navigate his issues while considering how his actions affect others. We both have our own problems and I understand that having the stimuli is unavoidable, how you treat others based on it is under your command.", "Nothing wrong with politelty asking somebody to be mindful of your sensitivity issues. (Problem is he stopped being polite after try 1) I think OP's roommate should have also brought up their grievances with OP's volume whilst gaming (though I doubt he would listen)", "Is that not the same thing? I would assume chewing with your mouth open means you are a noisy chewer.", "I think ESH - asking someone not to do something that bothers you is reasonable, and the roommate has clearly demonstrated that it is something they can control and doesn't. Op could get noise cancelling headphones or earplugs, you've gotta take control of your own experience when you live with others. The tools exist. There's no reason to yell at someone when they could handle it on their own. \n\n\"You also annoy me I just don't complain\" is some truly petty shit, though. How is she supposed to fix something if she doesn't know it's a problem? Lots of people are loud while gaming, and it doesn't annoy everyone.\n\nEdited because I think I used wrong pronouns for op so I'm just going neutral", "Yes, it's his responsibility to manage. I have misophonia and have several pairs of earplugs, live isolated in my room for the most part and can't attend a lot of social events.\n\nThat said, it's always been something really off-putting to me about people being more annoyed with people with misophonia than people with misophonia are with their triggers... people making people with misophonia feel like shit for being in pain all day. Like, people really want to eat with their mouth open (which they should have learned to do as basic manners anyway) so badly that the pain they cause others doesn't matter to them.\n\nI recently learned that mine is a manifestation of being molested as a kid, freaking out because someone won't stop doing something I perceived to be really simple to stop, begging someone to care even 1% about my discomfort, but they won't, they don't care, they want to do what they want soooo badly and you have to just deal with it.\n\nI'm convinced that people who know people that have misophonia, either say they get it and *really don't whatsoever*, or think the person is just trying to nitpick them. Neither of which I blame anyone for. I think that if people really *did* understand, people would be more accommodating rather than having a \"get over it\" attitude about it. Being molested and then having misophonia the rest of my life is just a constant reminder that straight up, no one gives a fuck about anyone. I mean, chewing loudly is the simplest thing one could adjust for the comfort of others.\n\nI mean, I'm super bitter about it obviously, and I've given up on getting my \"loved ones\" to understand, so all this is me venting/taking my frustrations out on someone else, because I can't put my \"loved ones\" through my bitching again... From their pov, I'm simply an introvert who wears earplugs all the time. Meanwhile, I'm actually a super bitter and resentful person who wishes they could bear spending more time around humans and just have more human interaction.\n\nAnyway, if OP doesn't realize he has misophonia, he has a long gruelling journey ahead of him.\n\nOh, and I hope you get annoying about your problems, too, so your \"mister\" can dismiss them and tell you it's your issue to manage.\n\nI hope I never end up in a partnership like that.", "Are out of your mind ? Why would op not know yelling is inacceptable? Did he grow up in a cave ?", "Wow, I think I might have some of this. My mom tends to play with her dentures, so lots of sucking sounds and clicking of her teeth. It's a nervous tic for her but it drives me up the wall. I love my mom more than anyone else in my life but I've turned into a real bitch about it sometimes. Snoring really gets me too.", "I have misophonia and luckily eating noise doesn\u2019t bother me, but the sound of dogs barking or dogs or cats licking, bass  literally sends me into a complete panic and then rage, it\u2019s nearly uncontrollable, I often wear ear plugs or headphones in daily life to avoid it", "You have the spelling right and I also have this disorder, it's neurological, and I was SO relieved when I learned I wasn't the only one in the world who gets crazy with certain sounds. But as a person who has this disorder I also know that it's up to me to manage it, and not to yell at others who chew more loudly than I can tolerate, or when other sounds are bothering me. \n\nHeadphones are a lifesaver. Leaving the room is an option (the person who has misophonia, not the person who is simply eating their dinner). OP is YTA for yelling at his roommate rather than simply leaving the room or putting on a pair of headphones, or simply saying to his roommate, \"look, I really need you to eat more quietly, thanks.\" The warning/yelling was out of line.", "Same! Or really any noise when sleeping. My husband and I sleep in separate rooms because I can not handle hearing him snore, breathe or anything.", "I hate the sound of nail files. It just makes my hackles raise. I take some deep breaths and, if possible, leave the room, but something about that noise just gets to me.", ">an\u2019t even control your anger just because you had a nervous day\n\nOP has misophonia and this is a clear misunderstanding of what's at play here. would you say this to someone with autism who is being overwhelmed by sensory overload? it's the same concept", "Eating loudly is disgusting and trashy as hell. It is absolutely annoying.", "Can\u2019t you just chew with your mouth open and it make the sound in that case?", "From OP\u2019s post history that does seem pretty likely", "Aww! That's so tough. I really hope you find healing one day, and I'm sad to hear that you bear this emotional burden and tragedy. If it makes you feel better, I don't dismiss my partners problems, re:identifying and supporting him in his choices. I believe we're masters of our own lives and let him make decisions based on his needs. So if he needs me to not eat certain foods around him he needs to speak out and say \"hey, I know it's the noise of consumption, but could you consume elsewhere?\" And I will happily do that, but if he just makes comments about it being awful I'm going to assume he is just airing his opinion and not needing any actions taken. Me chewing loudly isn't a thing I can fix any more than he can fix his belching. We both do get on each other's nerves for these human sound effects but it's just fleeting pet peeves.", "Oh boy am I not good at discerning negative emotions through text. I kinda feel bad. (But why did I get down voted for being a bit confused? Bit weird.)", "If sleeping more upright helps, you could look into tilting your mattress which is much more comfortable than trying to sleep while sitting up with pillows (and I'm a side/belly sleeper, so impossible for me). There are a number of foam wedge products designed to go between your bedframe and mattress to tilt it. I'm a fan of MediWedge, they run a few hundred dollars but go the entire length of your bed so you aren't folding/creasing your mattress at all. There are cheaper options that go only under the top part of your mattress (or sometimes just under your pillows+sheets). When I've had family or friends sleep in my tilted bed, they don't really feel much of a difference - I don't think it would be a big adjustment for your boyfriend to adapt to.\n\nIt won't be as effective as fully sitting up, but it's very comfortable. I don't snore (afaik), but I have chronic heartburn and my doctor pointed out the products to me."]}
