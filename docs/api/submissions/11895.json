If you did this to me knowing your uncle was racist I\u2019d probably be done with you and your whole family. YTA. You don\u2019t put people in situations knowing how it could turn out. June will never trust you again even if she seems cool with it. This is why people of color don\u2019t trust you\u2019ll actually have our backs. You proved you didn\u2019t actually have her back.

It's not June's responsibility to be your token asian friend who you can use to cure your uncle's racism. It sounds like you only invited her over for the purpose of \"sticking it to\" Terry. Did June know that your uncle is a racist? Did she know of your intentions to use her for that purpose? \n\nAnd that's besides that fact that you purposefully put June into not just an uncomfortable situation, but a dangerous one too! You knowingly put June into a dangerous situation. Plain and simple.", "YTA!  There are so many things wrong with this! 1- You're justifying Terry's behavior that he's usually a good guy. Ummm, no.  Good guys don't flip on and off like a light switch.  2- You deliberately used your friend to potentially \"teach Terry a lesson\".  What you did was use your friend as bait and subject them to another asshole in your family tree. 3- Your dad is clearly aware of Terry's behavior too.\n\nIf I were your friend, I wouldn't have been after this b.s.  You owe some sincere apologies and learning.", "YTA -- You knowingly put someone in an unsafe situation (without their knowledge/warning them???) to stick it to your racist uncle that you think is a good guy.  \n\n\nHey, people are not props for you to earn woke brownie points. You need to do some serious soul searching.", "You used your friend as a pawn, YTA and your uncle is a horrible excuse for a human", "YTA, a really, really humongous one. I doubt June didn\u2019t care. She was just protecting herself since you obviously didn\u2019t care. You should have never invited her when your racist uncle was going to be there. Also, stop calling racists good people. Your uncle is not a good person and neither are you.", "By bringing June over to our house, I thought I was going to knock down Terry's racism and show him that people are people, no matter what they look like.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nDon\u2018t get me wrong, You should have stepped in there way sooner, same goes with your father, but hearing something racist and like that from a person that you know as \u201cnormally a nice person\u201d can be quiet shocking.\n\nYes, you did knowingly create a situation where you let an open racist meet your asian friend, but\n1. You didn\u2019t know he was that racist, \u2018just\u2019 that he dislikes asian cultures,\n2. You are sorry for your reaction and your failed judgment and you wanted to make up for it,\nSo I don\u2019t think that YTA.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for 1. Or 2. You would be TA.", "Because it\u2019s not like she\u2019s a whole human being whose feelings and treatment OP should be concerned about. Is much more important he snubbed his nose at his \u201cgood\u201d uncle than be concerned about what impact being used this way might have in June. \n\nAnd hey, btw OP, if you exposed me to someone bigoted against me to get that kind of verbal lashing because you only see me and his bigotry as some kind of philosophical issue and not one of my actual humanity. I would definitely pretend I was fine until I could leave you *because that means you are not a safe person for me and sure af wouldn\u2019t be kind of I told you doing that to me was just as bigoted as what your uncle said*. I\u2019d just file that away, remind myself you are not one of the safe ones and act accordingly.", "100% agree!

Who does that to a friend!", "Sounds like OP had the \"white savior complex\".\n\nLike its ok to fight racism, but dont actively bring people into situations that will force them to interract with people who hate them because of their race. Not only is it rude, but its also manipulative since OP seems to want to be a hero.\n\nOP, if you want to call out your uncles racism, confront him when its not people **you** purposefully put in that position. Confront him when he even thinks about criticizing asians. But for the love of god, dont pull that shit again.\n\nYTA.", "Dude wanted to show off for the girl, is my guess. Show what an ally he is when his uncle starts spouting  off. Except, of course, he didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd June ended up hurt as a result.", "Pushed June in front of the car and then stood there and watch it hit her, even.", "Second this. And you know why June \u201cseemed unbothered,\u201d OP? Because many of us Asians are already given flack for being a minority, not being the *right kind* of minority, and etc, that we just don\u2019t make a fuss. YTA, be better", "They didn't tell their friend. Friend was blindsided by this.", "That's a horrible thing to put June through. She's a person not a teaching moment. You are not a good friend.", "*snort* And how exactly were you going to do that?  You stood there like an asshole and didn\u2019t say anything so you\u2019re either lying or your plan was shit.  And you thought possibly subjecting your \u201cfriend\u201d to abuse so you could act like the white knight was some kind of good idea?\n\nYTA, dummy.", "And by not sticking to for her, you showed her that some people are feckless cowards", "Holy shit, seriously? You used your unwitting friend as a pawn to confront your uncle and when it got nasty you didn't do anything at all? You had no right to do that to her. I already voted you TA but this is unbelievable.", "June became a pawn to your white knight fantasies to stick it up to your very much racist uncle? Just awesome \n\nHuge YTA", "YTA and a lower than a coward because at least they recognize that they\u2019re weak-willed and weak-minded. Take your white knight bs to a red-hat rally with your uncle where you belong and leave people of color, especially June, alone.", "They used their friend as a prop. They only brought that friend over to piss off their uncle, and when their uncle got pissed off, they did nothing to defend their friend, who has ZERO HEAD UP that they were going to be put in the presence of a violent racist.\n\nIf you think any of that is okay, you are racist. Full stop.", "I have a bucket of mental illnesses. None of them make me racist.", "Seriously? What did dad do wrong? It\u2019s his house and he let his brother abuse his sons friend for two minutes - and then got his son and friend to leave to appease his racist  brother.  He showed OP that his brothers right to be a racist in his house is more important to him than his sons friends right to just be there as a guest.  No wonder Terry thinks it is ok to be a racist AH - and is so unashamed he will attack the friends of people who have kindly let him stay. Is your dad racist too? Anyone who wasn\u2019t would have been kicking \u2018nice\u2019 racist Terry out. \n\nSo yeah dad the Ah for tolerating racist in his house and punishing the victim, oP the Ah for deliberately inviting his friend over to antagonise his uncle and then doing nothing to stop the shit show that followed and obviously uncle nice guy racist AH is an AH.\n\nYta", "Have a hard time believing that she just laughed it off.
