Even if the friend laughed it off, it does not mean it did not affect her.", ">This is what BIPOC mean when we say we don't trust some of y'all becausewhen rubber met the road at top speed you did nothing but stand there.\n\nPrecisely this. Like holy shit if this is the situation my \"friend\" were to put me into, I'd have one less \"friend\". If you're knowingly putting your \"friends\" into the same room as someone you know to be racist, then that isn't exactly \"friendship\"", "This", "No I did not tell June about Terry beforehand. In my defense, my uncle harbors racist beliefs, yes, but he's always been a covert racist. The type of guy who is outwardly polite to people while thinking bad thoughts about them or talking shit about them to people he's comfortable around. He's never had any outbursts like this before. I just thought that he would see June and say \"oh hi\" and then go somewhere else to do his racist shit.", "Also, your uncle is objectively a bad person and I\u2019m concerned if you really don\u2019t see that", "OP, YTA. June maybe used to letting racism slide, trust me it\u2019s not a new phenomena. But you \u2026smdh \n\nYou not only did everything in the comment above, you\u2019re here posting about it to clear your conscience because you still can\u2019t have an awkward conversation and be there for your friend.\n\nThere you staged and went in ready for an allyship movie scene. Instead you learned you\u2019re very much a bystander. The \u2018good men\u2019 who stand by and do nothing. You got so much work dude \n\nY T A is putting it light imho \n\nYou ruined Ottawa for me a bit too. Racism sucks, but Canada is one place I saw people actively shut it down even when it wasn\u2019t their business.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the uni canteen line, Chinese student cashier. Chinese student is paying, says hi to the cashier and made the usual small talk (seemed like when you know someone from a class). Everyone in line gets it, waiting patiently. The manager comes around and fully yells at the cashier, for holding up the line to socialise (she wasn\u2019t), and accuses her of potentially conspiring to steal or something because they were not speaking English and she\u2019s at work. Of about 7-8 of us in line, the minorities (2 of us) were shocked and giving looks, about to step in. The cashier and student talking froze, acceptingly. All the white Canadians, they sparked off. Shut it all down. We didn\u2019t even have to react. Pretty sure a coordinated report was filed. Entire food court heard it. They didn\u2019t offer her a beaver tail. Smdh\n\nNone of this is about you. Re read your post. You wish you\u2019d stood up to terry??? Did you need June to be the punching bag to justify you telling him off before this, or is it that you didn\u2019t say something until you had an audience?? Get real", "He cared more about looking like a white knight hero than actually protecting his friend.   June was a prop to use, not an actual person and wow did OP fail.\n\nI hope June gets better friends, she deserves so much more", "In fact he deliberately decided to use her as a pawn in your plot to \"stick it to\" your uncle. That's even worse", "He\u2019s too young for a Nam flashback, My money is on pure racist.", "This. It reflects the racism of OP that his agenda was more important to him than the safety of his \"friend\". He didn't even consider how it would impact her to be in the presence of a raging racist, let alone the potential risks to her physical safety that I'm sure she would have been viscerally aware of if he'd given her a heads up. I feel for her and hope she's able to find better friends cause this guy is dangerously ignorant of both his own racism and the danger he's putting others in", "James seems okay.", "[deleted]", "This is a really good point.

Basically everyone just let Terry yell and be a racist AH.", "Everybody would be getting cussed right tf out", "You invited her over to be harassed so you could play hero and then backed out on the hero part.

Next time, treat your friend like a person and not some token.", "Then YTA then, if you see Terry as a \"Nice Guy\" despite his racist mindset and considering you didn't defend June just to stick to him then you are a racist.\n\nYTA, you are a racist and I wonder how are you friends with June at the first place with this kind of mindset of yours. I hope June and everyone you know reads this and reconsider their friendship with you.", "Yep this 100%. I can just imagine all the instances he put her in where he thought \u201cit wasn\u2019t that big of a deal\u201d", "He should have expected it.\n\nWhy he's racist? He calls a racist a good person and seems to have a good relationship with him. What do you call a table with 11 people and a racist? A table full of racists. As long as he keeps a good relationship with a racist he's a racist", "He tolerates the racist shit, which is in itself racism. He also doesn't see Asian people as deserving of the same respect as white people, otherwise he would never have put her in that position", "1) Because he called a racist a good guy. No one that judges someone purely on their appearance is a good guy \ud83d\uded1\n\n2) what\u2019s he shocked about? He knew his uncle HATED Asian people.

I don't think the problem with the uncle can be worked out besides telling him to keep his mouth shut. Inn this case, where there's a clear aggressor that's in the wrong, I'd make them leave to cool off. It's OP's house and uncle racist is a guest.
