But you are N T A for getting beaver tails because they are the best.\n\nI'm glad she laughed it off, but yikes.", "\u201cI\u2019m going to openly defy Terry and stick it to him\u201d\n\nsince I\u2019m guessing June wasn\u2019t in on this plan, YTA big time", "YTA why would you bring an asian to a racist who especially hates asians", "Terry is the asshole", "If you told June about it and she was in on it, NTA. You're not narrow-minded like your uncle, and it's always fun sticking it to a racist.\n\nIf she WASN'T in on it, YTA. It's one thing to blindside your bigoted uncle; but it's a totally different story to blindside your friend with his bigotry.", "Yta", "Yta\n\nYou should have at least said something to your uncle. \n\nYou can make up for this by reaming him out and taking no more prisoners. Express how ashamed you are by his behavior. Demand he change his ways.", "YTA. You put your friend in real danger so that you could get your ego boost. And then you fucking failed at it. It's just pathetic on so many levels.", "ESH except your friends. Reflect on your behavior my guy. Did June knows and consent to your idea at all initially or did you just kept it in the dark and plan to just winging it? She did not deserve that type of exposure just because you\u2019re in the mood to do social experiment. She laughed it off but that shit could still be traumatizing.", "Hi fellow Ottawaian...DO BETTER! YTA.", "This can't be true. This is clearly fiction", "ESH except June. You suck for putting her in that situation and not shutting up your uncle. Your uncle sucks for being a raging racist AH. And your dad sucks for kicking the victim of racism out of his house instead of the perpetrator. Also, \n\n>Terry is normally a good guy\n\nRacists aren't good guys. Ever. Period. End of story. Even when he's not raging against Asians, your uncle is still a racist and that automatically disqualifies him from being a good guy. A \"good guy\" would NEVER treat someone like this in general, but especially for the color of their skin. Your uncle is an AH and a racist, and you and your family are AHs for standing by and tolerating it.", "YTA. Your whole family is. Racist a-holes. Tell James and June to find nicer friends.", "He always hates Asian people, normally a good guy? How does this add up?\n\nYTA and your parents too for kicking you out instead of Uncle Nasty. Also of course the uncle is TA", "Right. What if his uncle reacted violently? He had no idea what his uncle would do, and he let his friend walk in there blind. The fact that he still thinks Terry is a good person is disturbing.  I'm beginning to think op isn't that great of a person either.", "Yea this definitely stuck out to me too. He basically volunteered June to be the center of a racist confrontation so he could be a hero, then didn\u2019t become a hero. You put her in a terrible position. YTA", "Basically... his uncle is a racist AH who can usually control his AH nature. \n\nagree 100% with OP being an AH though... the friend at least deserved a warning.", "YTA OP. Also the \u201cwell she laughed it off and didn\u2019t seems to bothered\u201d that\u2019s a trauma response. That\u2019s not wanting to be \u201cthat person\u201d. I can\u2019t speak for your friend,  but I can bet this hurt your friend more than they are willing to admit to you. Also you used your friend as a pawn to \u201cstick it to the man\u201d without realizing how bad this probably made your friend feel for being just being born.", "Seriously.  That OP did this on purpose just makes my skin crawl", "Yup. OP treated his friend like a prop rather than a person so he could tell off his uncle, then didn\u2019t even tell off his uncle! He intentionally exposed his friend to abuse by a racist. \n\nIm white in a predominantly white country so I find it hard to imagine how I would feel in this situation. However, my closest approximation would be if a guy friend took me somewhere and didn\u2019t warn me of their uncle\u2019s sexism, just so they could tell their uncle off after he is rude to me. I would be extremely angry and hurt and tbh would probably terminate my friendship.", "Not only is OP TA, but also a bad friend.  Yes. You are so right - racists ARE bad people.", "Not to mention he never warned her. I have been in Julie\u2019s position before. She was very much affected by the situation. \n\nYTA, OP, and owe your \u2018friend\u2019 an apology.", "Also how does one \u201cdisagree\u201d w a culture?  An entire family tolerating and enabling a racist bully and OP feeds his \u201cfriend\u201d to him on a platter. So sh*tty. Massive YTA.", "I don't think Dad's the A H here. To me it sounds like he's trying to stop what is happening and having Terry leave would only spark a bigger fight. \"We can talk about this later\", sounds more like he understands things are not OK, but also that right now nothing good is going to come from a discussion.  \n\n\nEdit: Spelling fix", "100% that's why while I dislike when my grandma says to never trust white people I still 100% understand why and especially with all she went through in her childhood with burning crosses etc in the deep south. Stuff like this is always wild to me \"I brought my asian friend into a house with my uncle who hates asians, but don't worry I'll totally stand up for her, what could go wrong?\" Like what did they expect to happen? They call out uncle, he starts crying and leaves, and friend gives him a hefty high-five for his allyship? Bffr", "I am sorry you have to deal with this. \u2764\ufe0f", "OP is absolutely the racist asshole. They did not warn their friend that they were going to be walking into a dangerous situation. That all by itself makes them an asshole.", "OP didn't tell June what they were walking into.", "Nope! She walked in blind. OP did not provide any warning whatsoever.", "That line gave white savior vibes. He was expecting to look cool to the Asian girl by confronting the uncle. Premeditated but derailed.", "And he didn't stick it to anyone. He just stood there like a wet noodle while his friend was victimized by a racist. Real fucking classy, OP. You're lucky you have friends. I'd be sharing this tale far and wide If I was June, or even James. YTA in so many ways it's painful.", "Yes, he even said that the uncles screaming made him froze which should tell him how fucking serious the situation was and even though the friend laughed, they must have felt terrified too. YTA", "Yes! This is my issue!", "Dad's the adult here and he let it go on for a minute.  He should have shut that down immediately.  Like within seconds immediately.", "He didn't do an awful job, but he could have done much better. It would be nice if people stuck up for the person for once, rather than having them leave or ignore it in order to \"avoid conflict\" or \"de-escalate\"\n\nAlso, there's some blame for being tolerant of a racist family member who is THAT racist.", "Dad could have told the racist to shut up or leave his house.", "Yikes. I\u2019ll edit my response then.", "oh JTDC...", "Oh I believe she did 100% maybe more nervous (fake) chuckle and \"It's alright....\" been there and sometimes when you've numbed yourself you'll say anything to get the other person to drop it as fast as possible unfortunately", "We're always expected to be the bigger person. I remember watching a video of somebody harassing a black woman in a mall, the black woman started recording and stood up for herself. The mall cops told the black woman to get out. The cop, and some bystanders (if I recall correctly), and many comments were all blaming HER for taking out her phone and escalating the situation.", "Yeah I'm not a POC so I can't speak to experiencing racism, but I can say that many of the moments that still sting to this day were the ones that I \"laughed off.\" I felt absolutely horrible for June reading this story. OP def was the AH and seemingly has no idea how much an experience like that can hurt. Wow.", "But but but he bought her a beaver tail! What a disgrace to the ultimate snack.", "He definitely had bad intentions. He purposely put a young female is the cross hairs of an abusive, racist man and then stood there while he abused her. In his home. Saying*nothing* I have a pet peeve about people who bring horrible AHs into someone\u2019s space and then sit back and act as if they are astounded that they were horrible\nEdit YTA", "100% this!", "I think more info is needed regarding the dad.  \n\nHe could have been an ah and thought to only end the yelling.  \n\nOr his main goal could be to deescalate before Terry did physically aggressive.\n\nHard to tell without knowing what was going in his mind and the topic of the talk he will have with op and/or terry.", "We'd need more information to know that he could. I'd want to know if he sat and listened, or wasn't in the room until after a minute or two of yelling.", ">Like within seconds immediately.\n\nHave you not dealt with unreasonably angry people before?  It takes a bit to wind them down so you can deal with them in a reasonable way.  So Dad spoke to the people who were not unreasonably angry and asked them to leave so he could handle crazy racist uncle Terry.\n\nI swear that people just have some unreasonable expectations sometimes.  *This guy should have reacted in this theoretically perfect way in a stressful situation.  I'm an elite emotional ninja and would have immediately calmed down the racist using my special Racejitsu and kicked him into the street.*", "It sounds like OP was shocked at this outburst. I get the feeling it was not know he was THIS racist. Maybe an annoying comment or two, but stuff you can try to brush off for the sake of family.   \nSo maybe dad was also shocked by this outburst. I just don't feel like Dad, with the information we have, is in to much of the wrong here. Could he have handled it better? Sure but hind sight is 20/20. In the moment he has to deal with his brother shouting, trying to keep the kids safe, and all in the back of his head he's likely trying to keep the bridge of his family together without pissing anyone off in the moment.", "Sounds like having her leave was the best choice. Did you want the dad to risk the chance of this guy getting violent with the \"kids\" around when he confronted the jackass? Better to have them leave and deal with the kicking him out when they're not there.", "If Terry had been thrown out first there wasn't anything stopping him from waiting around the corner to follow OP and friends and continue with his bullshit. Getting the victim out of his reach needed to happen. I don't think OP's Dad should have waited that long to intervene but OP is definitely TA for using June to bait his trash fire of an uncle", "Seems likely. If he starts screaming at a 20 year old the second he sees her just because she's Korean, I doubt he's one for self-control much.", "And sometimes it\u2019s safer to laugh than risk it escalating to violence. \n\nIf no one is stopping his verbal attacks, how likely is it they\u2019d intervene with a physical one? As a woc myself, I\u2019m not about to trust some ah who purposefully put me in this position to get me out of it.", "And three years ago Asians were being hate crimed in droves because of COVID", "Yep, been I was often told growing up by teachers that no one was racist towards me because\n\n1-  I am Asian\n2- adopted by white parents\n3- not black", "It was more than acceptable in the northwest too. Don\u2019t forget about the camps the entire western population of Japanese Americans were sent to during WWII. Chinese Americans and Koreans had to wear special patches on their clothing declaring their race so the white majority wouldn\u2019t get confused. That still has an effect on the Japanese and Asian populations here. Oregon was a white racist Mecca with many holdouts still remaining. Despite how much the Pacific Northwest likes to think itself as progressive, the racism is still there.", "Okay, but if Dad lets Terry stay after this  he's definitely TA.", "Ppl *love* to make excuses for bystanders of racism. The prioritization of \"whatever brings the peace faster\" almost always involves telling the person being attacked for their race to \"ignore it\" or \"leave\". And then they are made to leave, being COMPLETELY undefended the whole situation. The racist isn't told off in the moment because it's much easier *for the ones who aren't being attacked for their race*, not the one who is. Regardless of intent, this should not be acceptable anymore. Time and time again people of color are expected to be the ones who keep the peace. OPs father is not just any old bystander, not a stranger. It was his house. He had authority here. He should have said something and I 100% fault him for not doing so.", "Precisely.", "Or for all we know Terry gets violent. Sure does it suck that you have to send the one being attacked away, of course.   \nBut Terry was already staying there, so it's hard to send him away without a fight. Terry is also clearly riled up at this point you need to calm him before anything of value happens.   \nI'm not calling the dad a saint, I'm saying I get how hard his position must have been. I've also been in a similar one myself. Shooting back at full blast never ends up well for anyone involved, it ends in a fight.\n\nAnd as I said, dad's probably trying to keep his family's ties in tack at least a little. Even if that bond is a little misplaced. Terry's an AH for sure, but Dad appears to me to be trying to save the situation for his household.", "I mean yeah but I'd worry that that would escalate things and make him even more hostile to June. Priority is de-escalate and have them escape before it gets worse", "Holding racist loons mildly accountable for verbally assaulting someone is something that would only happen on a TV drama? It\u2019s unbelievably sad that you think that."]}
