I was closer to him than my biological brothers. When he knew no heart was coming to save him he asked me to look out for Rosie and to be there for her in his place. He knew I adored Rosie and he knew I would talk to Rosie about him, that I would help her keep his memory alive.\n\nSo I did. We are still close today.

She told me she couldn't think of a living person she would have over me and that this is what she wants because her stepdad is not her dad. I told her as long as she's happy with her decision it changes nothing for me.\n\nBut her stepdad will not let up and he told me I should be encouraging her to ask him and that I am disrespecting him and all he did for her. That he was there longer than Jamie and the fact he still takes priority over him to her, even in this, and that I am going along with it, pisses him off.

Relationships are not a zero sum game, it is possible for her to look at you both as \"father roles\" but its clear something stopped her from looking at her stepdad like that.

If OP's sister was concerned that he was preventing Rosie from bonding with step-dad, she should have said something 18 yrs ago.\n\nThe other thing that makes me say, hmmm - why would step-dad be so hell bent on being the FOTB and walking her down the aisle when he knows she doesn't want him to do this.
