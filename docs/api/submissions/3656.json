So he knew his death was coming but had hoped he could get a transplant in time. Jamie had no family, he was a foster kid as long as I knew him, but we became brothers through our friendship. I was closer to him than my biological brothers. When he knew no heart was coming to save him he asked me to look out for Rosie and to be there for her in his place. He knew I adored Rosie and he knew I would talk to Rosie about him, that I would help her keep his memory alive.\n\nSo I did. We are still close today.

He has been in her life since she was 6 (my sister met him 10 months after Jamie died, started dating him after 6 months of knowing him and introduced them immediately). He and my sister are not very happy that she asked me, her uncle, over her \"other dad\" and they are unhappy with me.

She told me she couldn't think of a living person she would have over me and that this is what she wants because her stepdad is not her dad. I told her as long as she's happy with her decision it changes nothing for me.\n\nBut her stepdad will not let up and he told me I should be encouraging her to ask him and that I am disrespecting him and all he did for her. That he was there longer than Jamie and the fact he still takes priority over him to her, even in this, and that I am going along with it, pisses him off.

Stepdad can be mad all he wants but it isn\u2019t his wedding and he doesn\u2019t get to project his anger on you because the bride felt closer to you.", "NTA - my dad died when I was 4, and my mom remarried when I was 10. Her 2nd husband and I didn\u2019t get along; so I told my grandpa I wanted him to walk me down the aisle if I ever got married. Even though she had been married to her 2nd husband for almost 20 years (divorced now) and my dad was only alive for 4 years of my life, he could never replace my dad in my heart.\nI\u2019m not married yet, and unfortunately my grandpa died so that wasn\u2019t meant to be. But even so, were I to get married now my mom\u2019s 2nd husband would *never* walk me down the aisle, whether they were divorced or not. (They are divorced, so it makes the situation easier, but still.) \n\nShe (your niece) wants who she wants, and the second husband needs to pull his head out of his ass and accept that this event/day isn\u2019t about him.", "NTA, it\u2019s a difficult situation for the stepdad and I empathize but not to the point where his ego takes precedence on his stepdaughter on her wedding day. I think he\u2019s just hurt, and if he really acted like a dad all those years he\u2019ll come to understand. \n\nYou are NTA because her choice is her choice, you barely have a say in the matter, as rejecting her would be horrible.", "NTA", "NTA.  It's her wedding, her call. Stepdad needs to find another way to support her and get involved.  He's not respecting her decisions, and that's a great way to lock yourself out of someone's life.", "NTA, and as to why, let me just correct this line for you:\n\n> and said I denied Rosie another father.\n\nYou didn't deny her another father, you stepped up to be her father. I would imagine her stepdad did a lot of this \"I am your father now\" posturing, which is why she chose you instead of him or even both of you to walk her down the aisle. Relationships are not a zero sum game, it is possible for her to look at you both as \"father roles\" but its clear something stopped her from looking at her stepdad like that. As long as you were not alienating him in the past, this is Rosie's decision and you did nothing other than support a child who lost her father.", "NTA", "NTA.  The step-dad doesn't get to make the decision here - Rosie does.  This is her decision as it's her wedding.  Step-dad and mom are pointing out that step-dad has been in Rosie's life for 18 yrs.  If after 18 yrs, Rosie and Step-Dad aren't close enough for her to want him to walk her down the aisle, it's not going to change now.  \n\nFor Rosie to choose OP to be the FOTB, he had to be heavily involved in her life.  If OP's sister was concerned that he was preventing Rosie from bonding with step-dad, she should have said something 18 yrs ago.\n\nThe other thing that makes me say, hmmm - why would step-dad be so hell bent on being the FOTB and walking her down the aisle when he knows she doesn't want him to do this.  I'm wondering, who is he trying to impress?", "NTA   the stepfather would be allowed to be hurt & disappointed by her decision.  He is not allowed to be a demanding jerk having a tantrum with you to get his way. It's obvious to everyone but him that his behavior is the reason she didn't choose him.", "NTA.  Stepdad is trying to get her to change her mind about something incredibly important to her.  If he has been pushy about getting his way in things that only concern her, it may be a reason she is not as close to him as he would like.", "This.  It's her wedding day, and she is supposed to be able to have the day she wants.\n\nNTA, and I think I understand why she isn't close to her stepfather.  He sounds like a tool.", "And anyway with step parents there\u2019s no age requirement to decide. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a kid\u2019s life from 6 to 24 and they still don\u2019t see you as a parental figure, it\u2019s not on the kid. \n\nIt\u2019s telling that Rosie went with OP *to the exclusion of* the step father. Others are just fine having a 3-persons walk or a relay thing if they have multiple father figures.", "[removed]", "Bot alert! Downvote and report!"]}
