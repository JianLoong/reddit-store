Rosie was 5 when Jamie died. He was diagnosed with a heart condition months before and was in a bad way by the time diagnosis came. So he knew his death was coming but had hoped he could get a transplant in time. Jamie had no family, he was a foster kid as long as I knew him, but we became brothers through our friendship. I was closer to him than my biological brothers. When he knew no heart was coming to save him he asked me to look out for Rosie and to be there for her in his place. He knew I adored Rosie and he knew I would talk to Rosie about him, that I would help her keep his memory alive.\n\nSo I did. We are still close today. She adores my husband and I as much as we adore her. So she asked me to act as father of the bride in her wedding. She said it would be the closest thing to having her dad there. She also plans to pin a photo of him into the flowers she carries down the aisle.\n\nWhere the problem comes in is her stepdad. He has been in her life since she was 6 (my sister met him 10 months after Jamie died, started dating him after 6 months of knowing him and introduced them immediately). He and my sister are not very happy that she asked me, her uncle, over her \"other dad\" and they are unhappy with me. They say I prevented Rosie from having another dad and that my being so present with Rosie and allowing her to talk so much about her dad left no room for Jamie to fill in the father role. That he has been in her life for 18 years now and it's still not enough for him to be FOTB.\n\nRosie apologized to me for getting any trouble over this. She told me she couldn't think of a living person she would have over me and that this is what she wants because her stepdad is not her dad. I told her as long as she's happy with her decision it changes nothing for me.\n\nBut her stepdad will not let up and he told me I should be encouraging her to ask him and that I am disrespecting him and all he did for her. That he was there longer than Jamie and the fact he still takes priority over him to her, even in this, and that I am going along with it, pisses him off.
