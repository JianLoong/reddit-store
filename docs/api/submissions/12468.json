Not your problem.\n\nIf it comes up with your fellow classmates, just ask them if she said the same thing to all of them and what their response was? Also, I would ask how they would feel if they applied to a job that they felt qualified for and she got only because they gave her a heads up on the position?", "NTA, what are you? her personal secretary? No. She is being entitled.", "NTA, not at all. Unfortunately you could be friends and classmates but ultimately you\u2019re looking for employment. It\u2019s like that one person in a group project that gets the grade for minimal work.", "She wants you to send her the same job listings that you are applying for? Um. No. NTA.", "NTA - Searching for a job is not a \"team\" activity. Searching for jobs takes a lot of time and effort and there is no reason that you should do that work for her (or anyone else).", "NTA. Why sabotage yourself?\n\nMy friend had interviewed for a temp job and told someone about it, sharing client company, position and agency. Her \"friend\" contacted the agency, got an interview and got the gig. No idea whether my friend would've otherwise gotten it but you don't tell people until after you get the job.\n\nYour classmate is lazy and entitled. You have no obligation to provide job postings to someone in direct competition with you.", "NTA\n\nShe's competition at that point. Why would you send out jobs you want to someone else who could take it? She needs to do her own work. \n\nShe never said she'd return the favor, so the irony that she's saying you're not a team player...", "NTA. She just wants you to job hunt for her.", "NTA but she is. She wants you to do the work for her.", "Big NTA here.  Job hunting is a solo sport not a team sharing event.  She can look for her own jobs on her own time.  Besides, you might end of competing for the same job if you keep sharing what you find.", "NTA... She is being lazy", "NTA. Job hunting is unbearably time consuming and she basically is asking you to do all the work for her. She needs to be responsible for her own job hunt. It\u2019s one thing to give someone a heads up if you see something that would be of particular interest to them, but to ask you to forward her every single relevant job you find? Is she doing the same for you? If people give you a hard time just let them know you\u2019re happy to help people when you can but you\u2019re not obligated to invite the direct competition to apply for literally every job you\u2019re applying for as well. That you would never begrudge her the opportunity to apply if she finds the same listings, but that you aren\u2019t going to do the work for her.", "NTA\n\nLol wtf. Job hunt isn\u2019t a group activity, especially if you\u2019re peers interested in the same positions. She\u2019s delusional or thinks real world is a group project she can boss around.", "NTA. This is off topic but humour me. I teach in a competitive program. One time I enter the classroom overhearing a student telling another student what\u2019s on their test in another course. I begin getting ready and just smile as this conversation is going on. Others notice and proceed to grin. Finally the individual who is sharing realizes I am listening and says \u201csorry miss\u201d. I replied I don\u2019t mind and it\u2019s silly to think us faculty aren\u2019t aware of the cross talk and we wouldn\u2019t be prepared with other versions of a test. The student says \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together miss\u201d and I said \u201cuntil they (*points at student getting help) get in and you don\u2019t\u201d\n\nThe look of utter shock and realization of what I had said was true was burned into my brain that day. \n\nThat person is lazy AF and you\u2019d be a fool to help them. Good luck with the job hunt!", "NTA. Even if you were willing to do that for her, what would she do for you? There\u2019s a difference between working together and doing favors for each other and you acting like her personal secretary", "Nta she is entitled and expects you to do her job hunting for her. Don't help your competitors", "NTA\n\nJob hunting sucks. It would be silly for you to do all the work, just to risk losing the job to her.", "NTA. Doesn't want to do the work but wants to reap the rewards? Leech", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a team effort- it\u2019s a competition", "NTA you are not a team, you are competition. If she gets the job then you do not get that job.
