Anyway that\u2019s why I no longer get fishes from PetSmart", "And your maturity with this is what makes you TA", "I have never been in a pet store that just lets people manhandle small animals by themselves", "Aquariums have a delicate ecosystem. Things such as lotion, bug spray or cleaning products (bleach, detergent, ...) can absolutely damage the ecosystem.\n\nBefore putting your hands into an aquarium, you should wash your hands thoroughly and then rinse them thoroughly with running water. It's also just common courtesy/decency in the aquarium keeping hobby to never put your hands in someone else's tank without asking/permission.\n\nAquarium keeping 101: ask an employee to take the plants out for you, always.", "It's a different store. \n\nHome Depot as a whole is not specifically concerned about the treatment of plants. \n\nI'm saying that it completely plausible that if PetSmarts employees market them as living plants their general policy is that you shouldn't touch the pets In store. It wouldn't make you an Ahole for doing it UNINTENTIONALLY like op. But it does make you wrong.\n\nIgnorance of the law (in case store policy) is not a defense for innocence.", "Also I doubt most of these people have tanks. But you prolly did come to the wrong sub", "obviously never gone out of your basement", "I guarantee you if were to go to a Walmart in a beach city such as myrtle, you would be fine going in shirtless. But if you tried in a landlocked city such as Chicago you would be treated as a crack head. \n\nSpecific stores can have specific policy EVEN IF they are the same brand. Even more so, for completely different entities.", "I agree. I voted NTA earlier. You were doing what you needed to do to protect your tank", "For someone to immediately dip their hands in a fish tank, they wouldn\u2019t have paid attention to any signs that were present. And yes, this is still common sense to not do.\n\nOP feels entitled to inspect the plants, so having signs around was/is not the issue here.", "Yep that\u2019s exactly it"]}
