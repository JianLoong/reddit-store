It\u2019s the aquarium section, and the plants are in a tank. You should treat them more or less like the fish from an etiquette perspective, and ask the staff for help. If you want to inspect them more closely, then ask if you can do so.", "YTA.\n\nI have aquariums as well and bought many live plants.  You know that if you want the plants, you get the employee to get them.  You want to inspect it, you ask them to get them for you. \n\nThat's a 'no brainer'. \n\nThey don't want your hands in their tanks.

I assume there were signs you didn't see or just ignored.  The employee would have let you inspect the plants by holding them up for you. YTA", "YTA. You could damage the plant, aquatic plants can be very delicate. You could transfer something to the water (lotion, oils, etc). You could cross contaminate tanks if the have multiple systems. \n\nYou can look closely before you buy.  You should quarantine your plants when you get home to ensure no pests or disease are brought in.", "YTA. You don\u2019t put your hands into aquariums that aren\u2019t yours without permission.

They don't know what's on your hands.", "Well, I was really into the aquarium thing. I had over 20 tanks, belonged to a aquarium club, participated in a breeders program had some planted tanks and I breed fish. One thing I do know is people at petsmart are stupid when it comes to fish, plants and aquariums. Touching plants won\u2019t harm them nor taking out of water. How do you think they got them in there?  But if you wanted healthy plants, ask a worker to Come over, tell them exactly what you want. If they refuse to grab, pick or catch exactly what you request, leave. But never put your hands in someone else\u2019s tank. Personal or commercial.", "YTA, you could have contaminated everything you touched. Should have asked for help.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you need to touch a plant to determine if it meets your standards? You wouldn't be touching it in the tank.", "YTA, you should have called over an employee to help you. They don't know where your hands have been, you could be wearing a lotion that messes up the entire tank. Ecosystems are delicate.", "YTA\n\nJust ask an employee and they will show you every plant you want. You could break them by reaching in and handling them with dirty hands. They don\u2019t want you spilling water everywhere either. People could slip, fall and hurt themselves and sue the store. \n\nYou can\u2019t buy anything anyway until an employee bags it with a little water and writes the code on it", "YTA.  There's signs on the tank clearly asking people to not touch the plants. I know, because I volunteer at at Petsmart.  And \\*every time\\* someone gets caught touching the plants, their first argument is \"There were no signs!\".  Random people touching the plants causes harm to the plants, full stop.   \n You could have asked a worker to help you. You would still have been allowed to \"inspect\" the plants before purchase.", "YTA\n\nIf you really felt the need to inspect them you should have asked the store worker to help.", "NAH. I don't think doing what you did makes you an AH. But yes, you were in the wrong. Common sense would be to let a staff member know what you wanted to do and have them advise on the best way to go about it.", "I can see your logic, but you shouldn't be putting your hands in an aquarium setting for several reasons\n\n1: you may have contaminants on your hands that then get into the water and could damage the plants\n2: you then have wet hands so would be making drips on the floor or making anything else you touch wet\n3: The plant tank could have had added chemicals to promote the overall health of the plants / keep the water clear and display-ready for longer, and if you then go stick a hand in your mouth or accidentally touch your eye etc, you could be opening yourself up to not very nice consequences which is all kinds of health-and-safety issue for them.\n\nIn future it may be worth asking a staff member for help to look at the plants. That's their job, make use of them\n\nNAH because I feel like this was a genuine oversight rather than a deliberate act of assholery", "Info: Does the store have specific rules about handling the plants?", "NTA. maybe ask the aquarium before you touch next time. i dont see why not unless there were specific signs up to not touch. i think the staff is AH for yelling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I actually think you are a noob in the field if you don't know how to behave in an aquarium store. \n\nWater plants are not like \"ordinary\" plants, because they are used to the water helping them to stay upright.
