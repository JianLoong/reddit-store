It was our old condo that we rented out while we were travel nursing across the country, from 2020-2022. It ended up being so successful, we used the travel nurse money we saved to buy the next door condo, and we live there and rent out \"the other side of the walls\" full time.  We don't charge a lot, but we make enough to cover the mortgage and use what's leftover to save for improvements on the place. \n\nMy SIL, who was one of my bridesmaids, is getting married next year and so is my cousin-in law. I was not asked to be a bridesmaid in either wedding (we have a complicated history, my husband left the Catholic church after we were married so now his family blames me for it) and the cousin has not even told me any details about her wedding. I don't even know when it is (I know June), or whether I am invited (I would assume I'm invited? We invited the cousin+her family, and my MIL and SIL are very close with the cousin and her immediate family). \n\nAnyway, my SIL, who doesn't text or speak to me outside of family gatherings, but at Thanksgiving she asked to use my Abnb to throw a bachelorette party for the cousin, since SIL is maid of honor in the bridal party.  I didn't want to be ugly, or come off rude and told her to let us know what dates, and we could see what we could do. We later announced, at that family gathering, that we are expecting our first child in April.\n\nMy SIL texted, days later, saying the only time that's available for her and my cousin-IL and her bridesmaids is memorial day weekend, a month after my first child is born. And, she only wants Saturday night. I was thinking of hosting my extended family that weekend, so they could meet the baby and stay nearby.\n\nI asked my family if they would be willing to visit them, and they can't confirm or deny the weekend (it's December, we are looking at end of May) but would like to come. \n\n Last year, memorial day weekend was profitable enough to pay the entire month's mortgage on one weekend.  And, with the new baby coming, money is tight. Renting it to my SIL and cousin IL, for free, for one night in the middle of a holiday weekend is kind of a waste of a profitable weekend. \n\nAITA for telling my SIL no? She wants an answer NOW, and I want to say \"no\". BUT, I can't help but feel like a Hallmark villain, for explaining that \nA.) I'd rather use that weekend for my family to visit\nB.) If my family is unavailable, that's a really profitable weekend I'd be missing out on.\n\nGiven our rocky history, + the fact that she didn't invite me to the bachelorette that would be going on next door, + neither her nor the cousin have told me any details like when their wedding is, + SIL did not ask me to reciprocate being a bridesmaid in HER wedding....AITA for also letting those feelings come into play with my decision to say \"no\"?\n\nEdit: grammar", "created_utc": 1670963592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl63u6/aita_for_not_letting_my_sil_use_my_airbnb_for_free/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's pretty self-centered and you are  perfectly within your rights to tell her no.  She wants to take a day right out of the middle of the weekend which means you can't rent it at all and that's just selfish.

Your resentment will be your own fault because you were too much of a coward to say \"no\" if you go against your instincts.  Have courage that is in you.  Revere your small family and your spaces.  What you are building is sacred.  Say what you mean, mean what you say.  Say \"no, that doesn't work for me\".

If you want to use it for free, please pick a mid-week date that we can work around.\"    \n    \nAnd get a cleaning deposit, something substantial, my guess is this group won't clean up after themselves, and you will have a lot to do to get it ready for your next guests.", "Nta, but let her know that reason, it's a very profitable weekend.\nI'd personally just help her this once because she could start a whole fight, divide the family and with a baby on the way, as a pregnant woman myself, I'd prefer the silence and the quietness. It's not like you depend only on those money and even if you don't keep in touch with her, think of her husband, your relative (either your brother or your husbands) whose opinion counts more because you don't want such a trivial thing to stress you and the baby. \nBut this is just my opinion.", "NTA. A and B are very valid points.", "NTA\n\nExplain that Memorial Day weekend is already booked.  Offer her another weekend.", "NAH.
