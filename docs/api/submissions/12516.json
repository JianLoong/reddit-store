{"id": 12516, "submission_id": "11trxqv", "title": "AITA - Refusing to cook", "selftext": "I (41F) live with my husband (41M) and daughters (10, 17). Husband is a picky eater, which I've known about for 20 years.\n\nI'm used to making food and having husband and/or kids making faces, gagging, taking an hour to pick at a single serving, or just outright refusing to eat. My husband is notorious for coming home from work, taking one look at the dinner I've made, and opting for a frozen pizza.\n\nMost of the meals I make cater to their specific wants. Like spaghetti: 10F only eats the plain noodles. 17F eats the noodles with a scrambled egg on top, no sauce. Husband only eats noodles with a specific brand of tomato sauce with ground beef in it. If I use any other sauce (even homemade) I'm going to be eating leftovers for a week. So it's just the one recipe of spaghetti.\n\nThese days, husband complains that we have a lot of the same meals, over and over. It's true, but when I've explained WHY that's true, it doesn't seem to sink in. I can only make a few things that everyone in the family will reliably eat and those get old.\n\nA couple of nights ago I made a shepherd's pie. I used a new recipe with seasoned ground beef (3/3 like), peas (2/3 like), and tomatoes (1/3 like, 1/3 tolerate) with a turmeric-mashed potato top layer (2/3 will eat mashed potato). Predictably, 10F ate a single bite then gagged and ended up throwing hers away. 17F ate part of a single bowl then put hers in the trash. Husband came home late and \"wasn't hungry\".\n\nI was so tired of reactions to my food and putting in the effort for YEARS and it all finally came down on me at once. I burst into tears and cried all night and the next morning.\n\nSo I told my husband that I was done cooking. From here on out, HE would be responsible for evening meals. I would still do breakfast for the girls, and lunch when they weren't in school but otherwise it was up to him.\n\nHe said \"what about when I work late?\". I told him he needed to figure it out. I told him that between him and the girls, I no longer found any joy in cooking and baking, that I hated the way he and the girls made me feel when they reacted to my food, that I was tired of the \"yuck faces\" and refusals to eat when I made something new and that it broke my heart EVERY time.\n\nThis morning, he had to work, so he got up early to do some meal prep. He was clearly angry. He said he doesn't understand why \"\\[I\\] said I hated him\". He said he \"doesn't know what to do\" and thinks I'm being unfair and punishing him. He said I make things that \"don't appeal to kids\" sometimes and I can't expect them to like it when I make Greek-style lemon-chicken soup (17F enjoyed it, 10F and husband hated it). I countered that I make PLENTY of chicken nuggets, mac & cheese, grilled cheese, etc but that picky or not, there's such a thing as respect for a person's efforts.\n\nSo, Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1679061658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11trxqv/aita_refusing_to_cook/", "score": 662, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then maybe they will be more appreciative of your efforts.", "If he can afford to be that picky, he needs to cater to himself. You\u2019re not a short-order cook, and no one is helping you. NTA. He knows what things he will eat; he should also know how to prepare them, not just how to make faces at what you prepare.", "NTA at all!!\n\nLots of people would\u2019ve refused to cook anymore, except maybe for the youngest, years ago. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown-up, he can figure it out and potentially deal with the same frustration you have faced all these years. Good luck to him.", "17 year old needs to learn to cook. When she goes to college or out into the world nobody is going to give a damn about her picky eating habits. She will shop/cook or starve.", "NTA. Since your husband is so picky, he should man up and cook for himself and the kids. Better yet, get the 17 year old to start cooking her own meals too. \n\nI\u2019d personally tell him if I was around that he and the children caused this and they reap what they sow. \n\nDo not cook for them again until it sinks in.", "NTA went through this with my husband and I stopped cooking for him - best decision ever.  I started making double of what I eat , he was given the choice of eat what's there or cook it yourself - if he doesn't eat it leftovers for me. He got tired of peanut butter sandwiches and started eating what I eat. If he complained I just said then don't eat it. He decided it was easier to not be picky and he now cooks in turn. Make what you want, put it down and if they hate it they can make it themselves- but you'll probably have to have a back up for the 10 yr old. And the 10 yr old is most likely following dad's example - stop catering to them!", "Absolutely NTA. They are all perfectly capable of preparing their own food and cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen. My husband will eat just about anything but my children learned quickly if they didn't like what I prepared for dinner, they were free to have a bowl of cereal. I was preparing one meal, not three.", "NTA.\n\nYou've sucked it up for years while they acted like you were going to poison them. They're all old enough to cook. (Yes, the 10YO as well, under supervision.) Let them make meals for a while.", "NTA. You have had the patience of a saint. Enough's enough already!", "NTA. \n\nThis was exhausting and irritating to just READ, I can't imagine actually *living* it. \n\nI would've done this years ago, honestly. And it's not even that they're picky, really, it's that they're so damn rude about it AND your husband has the audacity to complain about the lack of variety in the meals. \n\nNo, it's time for him to deal with feeding the the picky eaters in the house including himself. I suggest you start finding some delicious recipes for two for you to make, so you can cook and eat exactly what you want with a meal leftover, and no worries about feeding your ungrateful family.", "NTA.  This is a very difficult situation.  I'm sure you know the advice that you put the food out, and the children at the table choose what to eat.  \n\n\nIt's really disenheartening to make an effort to cook, and then have the food get rejected.  \n\n\nThere are several issues here:  \n\n\n1. no one should be gagging or otherwise rude about the food being served.  If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it, but they need to be polite.\n2. Everyone in the household needs to help with meal prep.  Your husband is a grown ass adult, and he needs to be able to prepare a few meals.  The children are old enough to start helping with making dinner.  The 17 year old will be an adult soon, and should absolutely be able to make a complete meal, without much supervision.  The ten year old should be able to do a lot of the steps.\n\nLuckily, there's a solution to all of these problems.  You are no longer the cook for the family.  Instead, the family is going to have a schedule by which everyone in the house will make dinner once or twice per week.\n\nThey're going to be 100% accountable for that one or two dinners.  That means that on Sunday, there's going to be a family meeting.  Everyone will put their food needs on the shopping list, so that whatever they need will be stocked.  You will also buy a few emergency back up items (bread, peanut butter, yogurt, etc.) so that everyone has \\*something\\* they can fall back to, if they absolutely cannot eat what is on offer.  \n\n\nAdditionally, whoever cooks dinner is not the person who cleans up.    \n\n\nGet a big ol' wall calendar, and you can either let people sign up for the days they want to do dinner, or you can literally roll dice to assign it.  \n\n\nEither way, you are no longer a short order cook in this family.  \n\n\n(The suggestion I'm making here was implemented by a single dad and his two 11 year old sons, and those boys grew into adults who knew how to cook and how to clean up a kitchen.)", "NTA. You have more patience than me. I can't believe your husband complained about not having variety in his meals.  Everyone can cook something. If you eat and  read you can follow a basic recipe. It may take a few tries but it's possible.\nTeaching your kids and husband to cook for themselves is not a bad thing.\n\nI would buy frozen food for them to eat and cook for just myself.", "NTA. My 14 year old was an insanely picky eater and I spent a decade cooking gross basic food and lost all the joy of cooking. When he turned 13 I laid down the law - I cook what I like and every meal will have one basic element that I know he likes. If he's too picky to eat the rest of dinner he can make a sandwich or cup of noodles or have fruit. It took a few months and now he eats without complaint. You are a couple decades late doing this for your husband, but he is capable of learning. \n\nIf you can afford it, make the meals you want but enough for everyone. I think after a few weeks of whatever bland ass crap your husband manages to pull together, people will slowly drift towards your cooking.", "My sibs and I (mostly boys) could cook before we were 17. We each had things we liked to make, and together we could make a meal. Mom (who was a very good,  from scratch cook) let us have at it. She had been the baby of the family and her big brothers didn't want to eat her cooking, so she learned to cook after she got married.", "Good Christ NTA everyone is old enough to make their own damn food at this point. You're their mom and wife not a short order cook.", "NTA. I can understand why you\u2019d be fed up. \n\nI don\u2019t understand your husband\u2019s complaint about \u201cwhat if I work late?\u201d He already has no problem pulling a pizza out of the freezer when he gets home from work. He just doesn\u2019t want the responsibility. \n\nAlso - treat yourself. Go away for a weekend, by yourself or with a friend. It doesn\u2019t have to be lavish. But you need to do something for YOU. This will also let your family get a sense of what it\u2019s like cooking for them.", "Why are you coddling these people? The children are going to grow up to be unbearable just like your husband. Cook whatever you want, and if they don't like it, they can be fuckin hungry. NTA.", "Without detail, I'm leaning toward NTA.\n\nHubs and 17f can absolutely cook for themselves at this point, and unless you don't work at all, and you are the homemaker for your family, the OTHER PARENT has some feeding responsibilities towards their picky-eating children themselves. \n\nDetails I'm interested in are you and your husband's work schedules and other household/family chores, INCLUDING any child care/transport. If you're a f/t homemaker, I do view not cooking as not doing part of your job, but if you have ANY outside employment your husband shouldn't put the entire burden of cooking on you.", "NTA all power to you.", "NTA.

Some parents make their kids eat what\u2019s on the plate, others don\u2019t, etc. My parents would be fine if I didn\u2019t eat what they made as long as I took care of what I was going to eat instead.\n\nI feel bad because I\u2019ve been a picky eater too, especially when younger, and also often didn\u2019t eat the meals my mom made. I tried to keep her feelings from getting hurt, but did I? I tried, but still\u2026 I\u2019d usually try a bite of it at least, and if I didn\u2019t like it (she\u2019d often ask), I\u2019d say something like \u201cI can tell it\u2019s a good [whatever dish it was], but it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like [that dish, or some characteristic of it like being super spicy, etc.].\u201d (Meaning that for someone who liked that dish, they would love it; it wasn\u2019t how she made the food that was the problem, it was just the dish itself.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t it throw away however. I\u2019d let someone else have it, and I might say \u201cAt least this way there\u2019s more for you (who like it),\u201d as in, the food will be eaten by someone who likes it this way. \n\nWe reached a sort of compromise: I didn\u2019t complain about what she made and she didn\u2019t have to make dishes that I\u2019d like (for example, it was fine for her to make seafood even though we both know that\u2019s something I don\u2019t like), and she wouldn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d me to learn to love what she made. (Example: when she made seafood, she didn\u2019t force me to eat any of it).\n\nAs for the faces your kids make, I would (if you haven\u2019t said it to them before) tell them that it hurts your feelings when they do that. Since their dad does it too, they might not realize that you\u2019re not okay with it. Not that it\u2019s an excuse but it may help going forward.", "NTA.

He had to be taught not to be rude about it.", "NTA. Barring any sensory issues from your children --and it doesn't sound like this is the case--this is 100% a learned behaviour from your husband.

Big fam here, and while it is a bit demoralizing when there is only a handful of meals that \\*everyone\\* will eat, there needs to be some expectation management. Currently, it's \\*you catering to everyone's wants & nothing of them taking ownership of their own behaviors. \n\nI think your spouse doing the cooking for a bit, will set you up nicely, if you choose to go back to making meals. \n\nMy own \"goal\" was meals that at least half of the family liked.  If we got to 80%, approval, I was thrilled.  I often had meals that went well with plain rice/pasta/veggies, and very few 1-pot meals. We almost always have plain rice or pasta in the fridge, and ramen in the cabinet.  If someone didn't like \\*anything of the meal, they were free to eat leftovers or cook their own.  I am not even making a quesadilla.  They can do that themselves.  Even little guys can make a pb&j or ham sandwich.  They may feel a bit left out on a nice, hot dinner, but whatever...they'll learn to enjoy their sad dinner or eat more adventurously. \n\nBut mostly, it goes like this: Say we have swedish meatballs w/rice, veggies on the side.  Like 2 people with eat veggies, all but one will eat the rice, one of them \\*only eating the rice  One will eat the meatballs without the sauce (so I'll put some meatballs to the side before finishing up).  The one that only eats the rice, will go in the fridge to put some cheese on top.  Whatever, we're good. That's a WIN. Even if only half are really \"happy\" with the meal as a whole, everyone had something hot to eat. \n\nWhile I don't cook stuff only one or two of us will eat for dinner, I \\*will make those things for lunch.  Lunch is a free-for-all, and everyone is responsible for their own.  My youngest is now 12, but it has been like this for a few years.  Sometimes they will cook their own mac&cheese, chicken nugget or fish sticks. lol.  I will make things no one else will eat, like cabbage rolls. lol", "NTA at all! It was frustrating just reading it!

Maybe even ask if anyone is interested in helping you cook. Kids are often more willing to try things they were involved in helping create. Like, tumeric is very yellow. I can understand why a kid who\u2019s used to buttered noodles would see yellow potatoes and be like \u201cI\u2019m unsure about this.\u201d But seeing and tasting the components could help demystify it.\n\n\u2026\n\nMaybe also be aware, and make your kids aware, that this behaviour is not okay at other people\u2019s houses either.

Others would have a list of only like four items they would eat, which  they requested at mealtime. We ended up just not having them over as much because we lived out of town and my parents didn\u2019t want to have to do a specific grocery shop just so I could have a friend over for the afternoon. I had a roommate in college who only ate boiled chicken and boiled canned peas and corn and rice and potatoes. But she didn\u2019t stop there; she also threw out my stuff or scoffed at my perfectly normal food. It ended up embarrassing her in quite a few situations when she was called out for being unnecessarily judgemental, sheltered, limited her experience with food. I just told her to shut up and eat her buttered instant rice, but I can see how she could easily have been a bully, say in a school setting, if someone more shy or less confident came in with a perfectly lovely ethnic dish that she wasn\u2019t familiar with.", "Yeah - you're not the asshole here.

I\u2019m not a picky eater so I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d navigate mealtime, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of exporting responsibility for my particular tastes onto someone else. Say, in what other ways does your husband display this pathetic learned helplessness? In how many areas of life has he decided that you\u2019ll be changing his diaper?\n\nOP, please do NOT back down from this.

And they were petty fights too, which were only really resolved when I made a decision about what to cook. \n\nIt was surprisingly an easy and good decision. Now there\u2019s better flow of communication about the dinner question. If one of us really feels like eating something, we cook it. If not, cold sandwiches are perfectly fine. \n\nNTA", "Honestly OP my heart breaks for you reading this. The fact that not one member of your family seems to respect you or what you do for them is so sad and I feel like this stems all from your husband.

My kids have gone through a lot of picky stages and when my husband was deployed it almost broke me because I was already exhausted and then having the only other person who would reliably eat my cooking gone was a lot. \n\nYour kids are old enough to help with dinner. Assign them a night to help cook. The 10 year old will obviously need more help but the 17 year old should be able to cook with just you being there to answer questions. Husband should also take on several nights cooking too. I find it a lot easier if I only have to come up with meals a few times a week over every night. I care a lot less when they don\u2019t like a meal.", "NTA. OP, have you heard of ARFID? The fact that all three of them have such specific things they\u2019ll avoid, and your husband was buying his own food at 14/15 when his mom was cooking for them, sounds like something psychological or physical going on. Might be worth looking into.", "NTA. If I were you, I wouldn't cook for any of them AT ALL. I would only cook for myself. I love cooking and baking but if all my hard work is going to be brushed off an unappreciated like that, why would I continue?

I know, and I accept that. Other than those reasons, really, picky eaters suck. They just do. Because except for any of the above, it just means you were spoiled to heck and didn't grow out of it.\n\nFood is such an inherent aspect of social life, of acceptance, of being welcoming of different things and other cultures, of comfort. Of course we all have preferences, but that does not mean you are entitled to make yucky faces to something that was made for you. That's just preposterous in my book. You've been so patient for all these years, I have no idea how you did it. And you know what's worse? Dad's behavior has rubbed off on your daughters. Shame on him.

But you hate the way he reacts to your cooking and 20 years of dealing with his and your kids shit, you've had enough.", "Why in the world have you been catering to this? Make 1 meal and they eat it or its leftovers. You are turning the kids into being like their dad, not to mention what happens on overnights or when they go to college. Nobody is going to starve if they have to just eat part of their dinner. My kids were somewhat picky and could usually find something in each meal or they made a snack later. Give them each a night a week to cook. I imagine they will expand their repertoire as they learn to cook.", "NtA and update pls!!!!!", "NTA\n\nWhen I was a young picky eater I remember one day saying that I thought something my mom cooked was \"disgusting\" I'll never forget how hurt she was and how angry my dad got at me for saying that.", "NTA. I\u2019m an adult picky eater (mostly a texture thing for me), my partner is very adventurous when it comes to food. Typically, we just make separate dinner every night for ourselves. At this point, I\u2019ve accepted that my menu is going to be quite limited if I\u2019m not willing to try anything new and it sounds like he needs to arrive to this conclusion as well. What does he expect you to do? it seems that every time you try to make something new they make a stink about it. There\u2019s only so many meals you can make with such parameters. I usually try to incorporate little things to my regular meals (like adding green onions to my Mac and cheese lol), gives a little variety without compromising on foods I like. He could always try that instead of making you work with near-impossible requirements for dinner. It\u2019s just not fair to expect all this of you tbh. Not to mention it\u2019s a slap in the face to put effort into making food just for it to go to waste when he makes a pizza or something. I would be hurt/annoyed too.", "NTA.

Unless the kids have actual food aversions (diagnosed by a professional), they just picked up your husband\u2019s food pickiness because you accommodate him.  That sort of makes this an E-S-H as you could have made an agreement that when you have kids, he will make an effort to try foods, not make faces or negative comments about food, and if he can\u2019t do those things, he will have to eat elsewhere after everyone else eats.  I\u2019ve seen it in families, kids pick up picky eating from a parent or sibling and then you are screwed.  They are all old enough to learn to make something they will eat.  I was younger than 13 when I was taught to make something for myself because there were a couple dishes my mom cooked that so could not stand and she didn\u2019t have to make more than one dinner.  Get those kids cooking their own dinners.  Also if dad is going to set a terrible example by relying on mass produced frozen dinners, he should be the one grocery shopping for them.  You can also make the kids responsible for putting ingredients they need to cook on the grocery list.", "NTA. You are a saint for putting up with it that long.

I am so sick of the stereotype that there's \"kid friendly\" food. I ate what my parents cooked as a kid, with the sole exception of lima beans. Kids prefer those things because they're given them as a placation for not eating their dinner, so they associate it with a reward. You can't eat chicken nuggets the rest of your lives.

My stepdad was a chef and mom a waitress while I was growing up.  Due to their schedules, working late, they didn't cook at home very often, if they did it was a special occasion and the food was amazing.  My sister and I had took cook for ourselves at a young age.  I remember eating a lot of cereal (that I now hate) and relying on food from school a lot.  On the flip side we were also often in nice restaurants eating amazing food there too as booth kids.   My parents had one good rule about food is that you had to try everything at least once (fresh oysters for example).  I would never in a million years dream of rejecting food like your kids did.  One of my favorite memories as a child was sitting outside in an ornamental garden (around age 5) being served enchiladas rojas stuffed w/ cheese by my great grandmother.  \n\nIt seems like you have some nice cooking skills and have been generously cooking for everyone for years.

Do any of them have genuine food aversions or are they spoiled?  IF they have food aversions, then it may not be able to be helped  All 3 of my kids are AuDHD & along with that comes food issues.  I came from a home where you ate what was put in front of you & survived.  I was also government cheese poor but my mom was a fantastic creative cook who could stretch a dollar.  I thought I'd be the same with my kids.  Having a kid scream & cry all night long because they were hungry but literally could not eat the food you'd served them for dinner broke me of that notion.  Instead I educated myself on food aversion, saw a dietician & work with them to make sure they get the needed calories & don't go hungry.  My oldest was in the 1% for weight.  That's more than pickiness we've got him up to around 5%.  We do introduce new foods & try to expand their palates.  Success varies.  Sometimes we made two separate meals.  Sometimes we make a meal that everyone will eat different elements (plain spaghetti for two, spaghetti with meatballs for the third) & there are a few winning meals we all will eat.  I could not have survived this if my DH also had food issues & was an ass about it.  He's an adult & can help you plan & execute a meal plan.  I'd also involve the kids in meal planning.  And finally, have a standby meal for them.  My DH's standby was PB&J or JTM burgers when he didn't like what his mom was making.  He also had to make his own food if he wanted something different.", "NTA I grew up with my grandma and my brother and I were really picky eaters.

It\u2019s long overdue for your husband to get a taste of his own medicine. \n\nI recommend that you start cooking for and eating with friends who will enjoy your cuisine. Cooking for open minded eaters is a pleasure.", "NTA! Grown ups. 17 and 10? And a Grown man??? You have drawn the line. Stick to it! Dad can feed the selfish nitwits for a while.

And I hope you have some personal disposable income so you can indulge your own tastes while this is in progress. \n\nGood luck.", "Doubt my input is even needed but absolutely NTA.  Your family wants to complain about meals all being the same and boring, while also complaining whenever you try something new. Your response was perfect and honestly was due WAY sooner than this. You laid it out pretty clearly. If your family isn't going to eat the meals you make, and what's worse they're going to show clear blatant disgust and disrespect towards your efforts, then fuck it you don't have to cook for them. It's not like it was ever your duty to do the meals.\n\nA couple extra points:\n\n1. Personally, if it were me, I'd even just start cooking dinners just for you. You clearly enjoy a wide variety of food and like to explore new options, and if you're already committed to having the rest of the family manage their own dinners (absolutely reasonable, again as I said above), then you might as well occasionally try smaller recipes just for yourself. And who knows, maybe you can get your family to occasionally try small bites to see if they like it and maybe work back to making meals for them again, IF that's something you have any interest in, which leads to:\n\n2. While I don't ever want to discount that many people can be picky eaters or even just have specific food aversions (especially at younger ages), based on your daughters' reactions, I think it might be more of a learned behaviour than genuine dislike or pickiness. They both seem incredibly comfortable with showing a frankly absurd amount of disgust, and throwing meals away, on a seemingly regular basis without even a concern for your feelings or efforts.\nI think they're mostly picking this behaviour up from your husband and feeling emboldened by him. Even if this isn't true though, your husband really really needs to be freaking talked to.

I am not necessarily a fan of \"eat what I cook or don't eat,\" but there is a line and all of your family members are crossing it. Your husband and eldest are old enough to understand why this is a problem, why it is hurtful, and how their behavior is exhausting. The 10yo gets a pass because, obviously, little kids can't always think empathetically. The spaghetti example is a good one. I would literally say \"okay you all want it differently, you won't try eating each other's versions, so I'm going to boil the noodles and heat a sauce and the rest is up to you.\" Like... literally everything would need to be taco bar style, if that makes sense. You want an egg? You make the egg. You want ground beef? You cook it. I would get you halfway there.\n\nThat or eat a frozen meal. Honestly OP, stick to your guns. Start making servings of what you love to cook for 1 and tell them they're welcome to figure it out, especially the older two. If they're not even going to try new things and not act like children (except the one who is a child ofc) about a free meal, then they can make it work. They're not treating you like a person with feelings, they are treating you like an in-home chef they can boss around ad there's 0 gratitude. The only other thing I would suggest trying without compromising your very correct feelings is to say \"okay, why don't you two look up some recipes for next week? Find two each that you really think you'll like and I'll make them, but I'm not putting in all the effort anymore. And if you don't like it, then either eat it and suck it up or go grab a can of spaghetti-os.\"\n\nAnd a final thought: if the teenager and the hubby decide to live off frozen food and fast food... let that be on their dime.

I only know of three things that could cause it: ADHD, Autism, and ARFID.\n\nADHD and Autism both tend to come with sensory issues, though they aren't the same 'type' so to speak. With Autism it's that the food texture, taste, or smell can feel bad or wrong. In my experience, it usually makes me literally feel nauseous to try and eat things with a 'bad' or 'wrong' texture or taste.\n\nWith ADHD it's more that those things can be overwhelming or underwhelming, which makes it difficult to eat those types of things.\n\nARFID, however, is the one I'm honesty more leaning towards. It stands for Avoidant-Restrictive-Food-Intake-Disorder. It's relatively new, I think. You can probably learn more about it here: [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/arfid](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/arfid)\n\nWhile I think ARFID may be more likely, don't dismiss Autism or ADHD as impossible. Girls actually usually show vastly different symptoms, or present those symptoms differently, than boys. If you go to look up the symptoms, try putting in 'Girl ADHD/Autism' instead of just ADHD and just Autism. Also, maybe try to find some personal stories from women with ADHD or Autism. They may be able to explain some things in a way that normal google can't.\n\nThere also may be other similar things that can cause pickiness to such an extreme, but I don't know what they could be.

Being a homemaker IS WORK, so if that's the job she agreed to do to support the family while her partner leaves to get cash income, and it's balanced in that fashion, her not doing part of it would have been something that required renegotiating, which is totally normal as familys grow and age. It would require a different tactic to get what she needs fairly, but knowing how their home works is important to giving useful advice, so I asked.\n\nHere's the thing about gagging/faces at food: LOTS of folks have taste and texture sensitivities and don't have control over what their reactions are. Picky eaters are often neurodiverse and experience actual suffering at some things you might just think of as unappetizing. \n\nYou're right - the disrespect is one thing. But having food sensitivities isn't disrespect. It's just a biological difference. The only disrespect I see here is Hubs' refusal to acknowledge that his wife is cooking a minimum of two different dinners a night, that he doesn't try to help, and that he feels it's appropriate to critique her labor's variety. Which is about the WORK, not about the food. People are allowed to not like foods as long as they take the responsibility to work around that distaste themselves.", "I mean. Nobody ever has to anything, really. \n\nBut I'm hearing other issues that are important to consider.\n\nThe experience of not being able to swallow food is real. You're lucky if you've never had to live with it. It doesn't give the right to be rude about it AT ALL, but the reaction itself is valid, and Mom here is cool AF to acknowledge the issue her kids have. The rudeness issue isn't the gagging. It happens, and it sucks for the person gagging just as much as the person who put the effort to cook in. I'm super hesitant to characterize that part as rude.\n\nThe rudeness comes mostly from Dad's comaints about variety, because it's just whiny and unappreciative in this situation. It's OK to dislike food and be unable to swallow, but you have to be considerate and respectful about it and willing to help yourself find food you CAN eat. A 10yo is ready to learn this, the 17yo needs to learn this, and the husband should have learned this a long time ago. \n\nI've kept saying, over and over, that Mom/OP is NTA. But not being the asshole doesn't make the situation better for anyone. \n\nWhether or not she works is actually really important when you look at rebalancing the division of labor in families. So no, this doesn't excuse family rudeness, and no, she is NTA. But her time available is part of the big picture. So I asked if she worked.", "Boo fucking Hoo, the kids didn\u2019t like it.  Welcome to your wife\u2019s world, pal", "Excellent, thank you!", "FFS He is past the point of reason. So he will eat pie crust for a classic raspberry pie but use it on French silk now he hates it? Hell no. There are things I don't like and my SO as well. Everyone has some foods they don't care for but this is like it's his personality trait at this point. Monkeys would fly out my butt before I would keep catering to him.", "NTA\n\nGet a loaf of bread, some lunch meats and cheese, peanut butter and condiments and put it all on the table. Fix what YOU like and let them fend for themselves for awhile.", "Oh no, that sounds like mostly bullshit. Props to you for sticking it out for so long. Your husband is setting an awful example for your kids. Good luck!", "Its so wild for me reading some of this because I grew up in a \"you eat what's on the table or you don't eat at all\" type of home. I don't agree with that method and think that if someone doesn't like what's there they should be allowed to make something else.  But it kept me from being picky. I remember going to my cousins and her mom saying she would make kraft dinner and being heartbroken when they brought out a homemade Mac and cheese that wasn't good but I still ate it all and didn't say anything till I went home.\n\nI also discovered I loved Bortch this way (idk how you spell it but the soup with beets) went to a friend's and they had canned bortch and showed me how to warm it up. I loved it after that!\n\n\nI have two best friends who are some of the pickiest eaters I know (textures really bug them) but they are always willing to try something, which makes me love them even more.", "Strongly repellant to me. Not strong in the classic sense, but I would not serve it to eaters like the ones in OP's house.", "No stronger than mild ginger but it's SO yellow that it gets strong  reactions", "I only use tumeric for colour basically when i make curries.. it doesn't really taste of anything. It has a strong smell yeah bt i use it whenever i wanna make yellow rice. I didn't know people considered it spicy lol", "Personally I consider it a food coloring :D\n\nWould definitely add some to shepherd's pie to make it look better.", "Lmao this.  To me it adds no flavor and just turns things yellow, so I add it to food all. The time because it's good for you...or if I want yellow food.", "I guess this shows my strong aversion to it! I can taste it in micro doses. I much prefer saffron for coloring.", "The name explains so much.", "My hubs makes a great shepherds pie with Indian spices in sauce and mash. Mmmmm. Now I want some.", "Generally \"dear husband\", just an online abbreviation for \"OP's husband\".", "Not usually, but in this case, accurate.", "Lol it\u2019s Dear Husband", "Supposed to be dear husband but yours works better!", "Yeah kids can make a sandwich on their own if they don\u2019t want to eat dinner. Both are old enough to deal with it. Husband can make himself a sandwich too!", "Agreed. I have incredibly picky niblings. I always said to them they had to try one bite and if they didn\u2019t like it, that was fine. But they had to try it before saying they didn\u2019t like it. Then they could make some chicken nuggets for all I cared.", "My mom: \u201cThere are no hooks in your butt,\u201d implying we could get up and take care of ourselves. \n\nWhen my dad got older and was going through some mental decline we hadn\u2019t yet realized, he turned up his nose at something (uncharacteristic) and my mom said he could eat it or wear it. She felt bad later but I still think it\u2019s funny.", "My friend Renee often tells her kids \"if you're not hungry enough for an apple (or banana, peanut butter and jelly, whatever is offered) you're not hungry.", "I agree, especially with how expensive groceries are. They're creating a ton of food waste but they're also just shaking her wallet out over the trash bag too.", "If you have a shitty boss (your work analogy) who acts like this you wouldn't accept it. Let alone from your partner. She didn't mention sensitivities, just asshole behaviour.", "You might not be able to control your dislike of a food, but you can absolutely learn to control your reaction to it. Plenty of people do it, neurotypical and neurodivergent alike. I\u2019m tired of neurodivergence being used as an excuse to be an asshole. Just because it\u2019s harder doesn\u2019t make it impossible.", "Borscht! in case you want to find the can or a recipe.", "wow. this is crazy just reading. i wish i had the luxury for being \"picky eater\". when i was child. i consider myself lucky for being able to eat. when i was able to. but it was lots of hungry days and nights.", "I feel like there's picky and there's picky. There's \"EWW disugsting!\" and there's \"I don't like this one ingredient, I didn't like it last month, I won't like it next month, and if you put it in my food, I won't eat it.\" For my daughter, it's mushrooms. For my son, it's green peppers. I avoid cooking with those ingredients. If I do, I offer them leftovers, or else I put the offending item in a side dish they can skip. They don't complain.", "You should make borscht from scratch. It\u2019s delicious. Fair warning, it will ruin you for store bought borscht, especially Manischewitz which is way too sweet.", "[deleted]", "Same. My mom was a great cook and she had that rule u eat what i made. Unless ur allergic to it, physically can't stomach it or gonna die if u eat it..\n\nYou get what u get and u don't get upset! \n\nI always tell my cousins whose kids are literally the same as OPs because parents jst allowed it they honestly can't say they hate something when they've never even tried it before. Those kids are skin and bones. They dont eat fruit or veggies or even any meat except for sausage. They won't eat mash so it's usually just junk food in the form of sugar, plain rice and noodles. \n\nNothing that actually adds to their diet properly.", "I am also very surprised and confused", "I love turmeric and to me,  it does have a strong flavour.\n\nIt's definitely not spicy but it is flavoursome to my taste buds -  i could easily tell if it was in a dish.", "Spicy and strong spice are not the same thing. Cumin is a strong spice because it's very flavorful but it isn't spicy. Clove is a strong spice but not spicy. For some people (like me) tumeric has a strong flavor, so I could personally consider a strong spice. I rarely cook with it because it overpowers the dish if it's more than just a sprinkle for color.", "I wonder if it's something like cilantro, where some people are getting a completely different flavor than what most others would taste.", "I mean, I'm a poor enough American that I *do* in fact have to take this shit from my boss. So there's that. \n\nAlso, everyone keeps harping on the family reactions as rude. Again, if you can't eat tomatoes because they make you gag, that's a food sensitivity that tons of (very frequently undiagnosed) neurodiverse (ADHD, ASD, OCD, etc) people have, and it impacts neurotypical people to different degrees as well. I reject the gagging as rude, because I know what it's like to have totally reasonable food in your mouth and be unable to make yourself swallow. It really, really sucks. \n\nThe Dad is being an asshole in his demands for other reasons, and I do keep saying Mom is NTA for refusing to keep cooking. But again, her not being the asshole doesn't improve anything for her, and it doesn't keep her kids fed dinner. What her and her husband's time constraints are is a reasonable thing to consider when looking for solutions to redistributing the household labor so everyone is fed and happy.", "There's a difference between a dislike and a food sensitivity when it comes to sensory processing. You're right - tons of people can and do control dislikes of food, and even sensitivities. And I never said it was an excuse for rudeness. I'm just saying it's not rudeness ITSELF. There are two big issues with what you just wrote:\n\nOne - Sensitivities of this type are not perceptible outside the head of the person who has them, at all, and they come in all types and scopes. Some folks can swallow, others truly can't. Just because some folks who use wheelchairs CAN walk doesn't mean it's easy or that we should force them to. I think it's cool AF that Mom has been accommodating so far, but I also see that it's a ton of work that she can't do on her own anymore. She's in no way the asshole to limit her cooking to breakfast/lunch/snacks for the girls. \n\nTwo - please consider that I, along with my ND counterparts, am more tired of being neurodivergent than you could possibly be about hearing how it affects our lives, and complaining that other people have it hard and that you're tired of hearing about it is incredibly narcissistic. Sure, be tired about it. But saying it creates the impression that you're insensitive at best and a bigot at worst. You're tired of hearing it? Help us fix the issue and we'll shut up.", "Growing up with food insecurity sucked, upside is I\u2019ll happily eat anything\n\nCan\u2019t recommend it, though. Eating paper to stop my stomach from growling in class was awkward", "It's not a luxury for many people.  People with food aversions will literally starve because they cannot eat something that is \"wrong\" to them.  It's not within their control.", "I do make my own but I've used word of mouth recipies from Ukrainians in my area. They just have the best damn food.", "I wasn't disagreeing with you......", "Lol honestly my spice filter is broken so u might be right it is noticeable yes. It definitely gives rice s distinct flavor.\n\nBut as far as spicy goes.. i don't see it. Bt then again I've eaten and made so many spicy dishes in my life what i consider mild is scorching to others. I get into trouble for it alot \ud83d\ude02", "Yes, I found a turmeric chai tea once and it was delicious. Very distinctive flavor, imo.", "Um, I am neurodivergent (ADHD and autism spectrum). What I said stands. You can\u2019t control it but you can control the reaction. My whole point.", "I feel u on this one. Going to bed hungry sucked my family always tried their best. Kinda why i hate soya now tho had a stage where that was literally all we got from shelters. That and like the type of cereal you had to mix with water kind of resembling baby food. \n\nAnd after soya pasta, with rice, soya pie... i just actually started hating what we call struggle food basically because it's all we had as kids so i just had my fill of it and the thought makes me want to throw up.", "Gotcha - I misread your first sentence. I\u2019ll delete my comment. Cheers!", "Me too, love. So you know not all of us are the same, with the same issues, and that saying that if some folks can do something ALL of us should be able to do it is reductive and ableist. \n\nSOME people can control their reaction. Some can't. I'm able to eat strong flavors most of the time and actually like them. Sometimes, though, I legitimately can't swallow them and I gag because my body is trying not to choke because my senses are overwhelmed. It happens, and I'm more than prepared to believe that others have it worse than I do. I gag on food I love sometimes. It's sensory processing, and saying \"you can control the reaction\" may be true for you, but it's not the only experience of neurodiversity.", "The rudeness described isn't the gagging. That's a reflex. \nThe rudeness is insisting she continue to pour time into something that isn't working without respect for the consistency of her prior effort to be accommodating."]}
