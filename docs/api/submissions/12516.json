{"id": 12516, "submission_id": "11trxqv", "title": "AITA - Refusing to cook", "selftext": "I (41F) live with my husband (41M) and daughters (10, 17). Husband is a picky eater, which I've known about for 20 years.\n\nI'm used to making food and having husband and/or kids making faces, gagging, taking an hour to pick at a single serving, or just outright refusing to eat. My husband is notorious for coming home from work, taking one look at the dinner I've made, and opting for a frozen pizza.\n\nMost of the meals I make cater to their specific wants. Like spaghetti: 10F only eats the plain noodles. 17F eats the noodles with a scrambled egg on top, no sauce. Husband only eats noodles with a specific brand of tomato sauce with ground beef in it. If I use any other sauce (even homemade) I'm going to be eating leftovers for a week. So it's just the one recipe of spaghetti.\n\nThese days, husband complains that we have a lot of the same meals, over and over. It's true, but when I've explained WHY that's true, it doesn't seem to sink in. I can only make a few things that everyone in the family will reliably eat and those get old.\n\nA couple of nights ago I made a shepherd's pie. I used a new recipe with seasoned ground beef (3/3 like), peas (2/3 like), and tomatoes (1/3 like, 1/3 tolerate) with a turmeric-mashed potato top layer (2/3 will eat mashed potato). Predictably, 10F ate a single bite then gagged and ended up throwing hers away. 17F ate part of a single bowl then put hers in the trash. Husband came home late and \"wasn't hungry\".\n\nI was so tired of reactions to my food and putting in the effort for YEARS and it all finally came down on me at once. I burst into tears and cried all night and the next morning.\n\nSo I told my husband that I was done cooking. From here on out, HE would be responsible for evening meals. I would still do breakfast for the girls, and lunch when they weren't in school but otherwise it was up to him.\n\nHe said \"what about when I work late?\". I told him he needed to figure it out. I told him that between him and the girls, I no longer found any joy in cooking and baking, that I hated the way he and the girls made me feel when they reacted to my food, that I was tired of the \"yuck faces\" and refusals to eat when I made something new and that it broke my heart EVERY time.\n\nThis morning, he had to work, so he got up early to do some meal prep. He was clearly angry. He said he doesn't understand why \"\\[I\\] said I hated him\". He said he \"doesn't know what to do\" and thinks I'm being unfair and punishing him. He said I make things that \"don't appeal to kids\" sometimes and I can't expect them to like it when I make Greek-style lemon-chicken soup (17F enjoyed it, 10F and husband hated it). I countered that I make PLENTY of chicken nuggets, mac & cheese, grilled cheese, etc but that picky or not, there's such a thing as respect for a person's efforts.\n\nSo, Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1679061658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11trxqv/aita_refusing_to_cook/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then maybe they will be more appreciative of your efforts.", "If he can afford to be that picky, he needs to cater to himself. You\u2019re not a short-order cook, and no one is helping you. NTA. He knows what things he will eat; he should also know how to prepare them, not just how to make faces at what you prepare.", "NTA at all!!\n\nLots of people would\u2019ve refused to cook anymore, except maybe for the youngest, years ago. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown-up, he can figure it out and potentially deal with the same frustration you have faced all these years. Good luck to him.", "17 year old needs to learn to cook. When she goes to college or out into the world nobody is going to give a damn about her picky eating habits. She will shop/cook or starve.", "NTA. Since your husband is so picky, he should man up and cook for himself and the kids. Better yet, get the 17 year old to start cooking her own meals too. \n\nI\u2019d personally tell him if I was around that he and the children caused this and they reap what they sow. \n\nDo not cook for them again until it sinks in.", "NTA went through this with my husband and I stopped cooking for him - best decision ever.  I started making double of what I eat , he was given the choice of eat what's there or cook it yourself - if he doesn't eat it leftovers for me. He got tired of peanut butter sandwiches and started eating what I eat. If he complained I just said then don't eat it. He decided it was easier to not be picky and he now cooks in turn. Make what you want, put it down and if they hate it they can make it themselves- but you'll probably have to have a back up for the 10 yr old. And the 10 yr old is most likely following dad's example - stop catering to them!", "Absolutely NTA. They are all perfectly capable of preparing their own food and cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen. My husband will eat just about anything but my children learned quickly if they didn't like what I prepared for dinner, they were free to have a bowl of cereal. I was preparing one meal, not three.", "NTA.\n\nYou've sucked it up for years while they acted like you were going to poison them. They're all old enough to cook. (Yes, the 10YO as well, under supervision.) Let them make meals for a while.", "NTA. You have had the patience of a saint. Enough's enough already!", "NTA. \n\nThis was exhausting and irritating to just READ, I can't imagine actually *living* it. \n\nI would've done this years ago, honestly. And it's not even that they're picky, really, it's that they're so damn rude about it AND your husband has the audacity to complain about the lack of variety in the meals. \n\nNo, it's time for him to deal with feeding the the picky eaters in the house including himself. I suggest you start finding some delicious recipes for two for you to make, so you can cook and eat exactly what you want with a meal leftover, and no worries about feeding your ungrateful family.", "NTA.  This is a very difficult situation.  I'm sure you know the advice that you put the food out, and the children at the table choose what to eat.  \n\n\nIt's really disenheartening to make an effort to cook, and then have the food get rejected.  \n\n\nThere are several issues here:  \n\n\n1. no one should be gagging or otherwise rude about the food being served.  If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it, but they need to be polite.\n2. Everyone in the household needs to help with meal prep.  Your husband is a grown ass adult, and he needs to be able to prepare a few meals.  The children are old enough to start helping with making dinner.  The 17 year old will be an adult soon, and should absolutely be able to make a complete meal, without much supervision.  The ten year old should be able to do a lot of the steps.\n\nLuckily, there's a solution to all of these problems.  You are no longer the cook for the family.  Instead, the family is going to have a schedule by which everyone in the house will make dinner once or twice per week.\n\nThey're going to be 100% accountable for that one or two dinners.  That means that on Sunday, there's going to be a family meeting.  Everyone will put their food needs on the shopping list, so that whatever they need will be stocked.  You will also buy a few emergency back up items (bread, peanut butter, yogurt, etc.) so that everyone has \\*something\\* they can fall back to, if they absolutely cannot eat what is on offer.  \n\n\nAdditionally, whoever cooks dinner is not the person who cleans up.    \n\n\nGet a big ol' wall calendar, and you can either let people sign up for the days they want to do dinner, or you can literally roll dice to assign it.  \n\n\nEither way, you are no longer a short order cook in this family.  \n\n\n(The suggestion I'm making here was implemented by a single dad and his two 11 year old sons, and those boys grew into adults who knew how to cook and how to clean up a kitchen.)", "NTA. You have more patience than me. I can't believe your husband complained about not having variety in his meals.  Everyone can cook something. If you eat and  read you can follow a basic recipe. It may take a few tries but it's possible.\nTeaching your kids and husband to cook for themselves is not a bad thing.\n\nI would buy frozen food for them to eat and cook for just myself.", "NTA. My 14 year old was an insanely picky eater and I spent a decade cooking gross basic food and lost all the joy of cooking. When he turned 13 I laid down the law - I cook what I like and every meal will have one basic element that I know he likes. If he's too picky to eat the rest of dinner he can make a sandwich or cup of noodles or have fruit. It took a few months and now he eats without complaint. You are a couple decades late doing this for your husband, but he is capable of learning. \n\nIf you can afford it, make the meals you want but enough for everyone. I think after a few weeks of whatever bland ass crap your husband manages to pull together, people will slowly drift towards your cooking.", "My sibs and I (mostly boys) could cook before we were 17. We each had things we liked to make, and together we could make a meal. Mom (who was a very good,  from scratch cook) let us have at it. She had been the baby of the family and her big brothers didn't want to eat her cooking, so she learned to cook after she got married.", "Good Christ NTA everyone is old enough to make their own damn food at this point. You're their mom and wife not a short order cook.", "NTA. I can understand why you\u2019d be fed up. \n\nI don\u2019t understand your husband\u2019s complaint about \u201cwhat if I work late?\u201d He already has no problem pulling a pizza out of the freezer when he gets home from work. He just doesn\u2019t want the responsibility. \n\nAlso - treat yourself. Go away for a weekend, by yourself or with a friend. It doesn\u2019t have to be lavish. But you need to do something for YOU. This will also let your family get a sense of what it\u2019s like cooking for them.", "Why are you coddling these people? The children are going to grow up to be unbearable just like your husband. Cook whatever you want, and if they don't like it, they can be fuckin hungry. NTA.", "Without detail, I'm leaning toward NTA.\n\nHubs and 17f can absolutely cook for themselves at this point, and unless you don't work at all, and you are the homemaker for your family, the OTHER PARENT has some feeding responsibilities towards their picky-eating children themselves. \n\nDetails I'm interested in are you and your husband's work schedules and other household/family chores, INCLUDING any child care/transport. If you're a f/t homemaker, I do view not cooking as not doing part of your job, but if you have ANY outside employment your husband shouldn't put the entire burden of cooking on you.", "NTA all power to you.", "NTA.

Some parents make their kids eat what\u2019s on the plate, others don\u2019t, etc. My parents would be fine if I didn\u2019t eat what they made as long as I took care of what I was going to eat instead.\n\nI feel bad because I\u2019ve been a picky eater too, especially when younger, and also often didn\u2019t eat the meals my mom made. I tried to keep her feelings from getting hurt, but did I? I tried, but still\u2026 I\u2019d usually try a bite of it at least, and if I didn\u2019t like it (she\u2019d often ask), I\u2019d say something like \u201cI can tell it\u2019s a good [whatever dish it was], but it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like [that dish, or some characteristic of it like being super spicy, etc.].\u201d (Meaning that for someone who liked that dish, they would love it; it wasn\u2019t how she made the food that was the problem, it was just the dish itself.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t it throw away however. I\u2019d let someone else have it, and I might say \u201cAt least this way there\u2019s more for you (who like it),\u201d as in, the food will be eaten by someone who likes it this way. \n\nWe reached a sort of compromise: I didn\u2019t complain about what she made and she didn\u2019t have to make dishes that I\u2019d like (for example, it was fine for her to make seafood even though we both know that\u2019s something I don\u2019t like), and she wouldn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d me to learn to love what she made. (Example: when she made seafood, she didn\u2019t force me to eat any of it).\n\nAs for the faces your kids make, I would (if you haven\u2019t said it to them before) tell them that it hurts your feelings when they do that. Since their dad does it too, they might not realize that you\u2019re not okay with it. Not that it\u2019s an excuse but it may help going forward.", "NTA.

He had to be taught not to be rude about it.", "NTA. Barring any sensory issues from your children --and it doesn't sound like this is the case--this is 100% a learned behaviour from your husband.

Big fam here, and while it is a bit demoralizing when there is only a handful of meals that \\*everyone\\* will eat, there needs to be some expectation management. Currently, it's \\*you catering to everyone's wants & nothing of them taking ownership of their own behaviors. \n\nI think your spouse doing the cooking for a bit, will set you up nicely, if you choose to go back to making meals. \n\nMy own \"goal\" was meals that at least half of the family liked.  If we got to 80%, approval, I was thrilled.  I often had meals that went well with plain rice/pasta/veggies, and very few 1-pot meals. We almost always have plain rice or pasta in the fridge, and ramen in the cabinet.  If someone didn't like \\*anything of the meal, they were free to eat leftovers or cook their own.  I am not even making a quesadilla.  They can do that themselves.  Even little guys can make a pb&j or ham sandwich.  They may feel a bit left out on a nice, hot dinner, but whatever...they'll learn to enjoy their sad dinner or eat more adventurously. \n\nBut mostly, it goes like this: Say we have swedish meatballs w/rice, veggies on the side.  Like 2 people with eat veggies, all but one will eat the rice, one of them \\*only eating the rice  One will eat the meatballs without the sauce (so I'll put some meatballs to the side before finishing up).  The one that only eats the rice, will go in the fridge to put some cheese on top.  Whatever, we're good. That's a WIN. Even if only half are really \"happy\" with the meal as a whole, everyone had something hot to eat. \n\nWhile I don't cook stuff only one or two of us will eat for dinner, I \\*will make those things for lunch.  Lunch is a free-for-all, and everyone is responsible for their own.  My youngest is now 12, but it has been like this for a few years.  Sometimes they will cook their own mac&cheese, chicken nugget or fish sticks. lol.  I will make things no one else will eat, like cabbage rolls. lol", "NTA at all! It was frustrating just reading it!

You cook food you know they don't like, and are then surprised and upset when they don't like it.\n\nYou don't say whether you work or not - it's not clear from your post whether your job is homemaker (and so feeding the family is a normal part of your job), or whether you both work outside the home, and could be expected to divide the domestic labor equally. It is clear that cooking has traditionally been part of your responsibility. If you no longer want to cook, you don't say which other domestic responsibilities you intend to take on instead.\n\nI understand how boring it is to make the same meals over and over because the picky eaters in your house only eat a few different things. Husband appears to be an idiot - he cannot simultaneously be such a picky eater and complain that you eat the same things over and over, when the reason that you eat the same things is that he complains when you make something different.\n\nI have picky eaters in my house. When I cook, I tell them what I will be making. If anybody doesn't want the meal, I am always prepared to boil plain pasta (which is basically zero additional effort if I'm in the kitchen anyway), and they can grate cheese on to it.\n\nThere is such a thing as respect for a person's efforts, but there's also such a thing as common sense. If you live with people who don't like broccoli, then it doesn't make the slightest bit of difference how much effort you put in to preparing a meal with broccoli - they're still not going to like it, and you're delusional if you think otherwise.", "NTA for going on cooking strike.\n\nSlight YTA for conflating Spaghetti and Noodles - they're different types of pasta and the terms are not interchangeable", "You make all these things, but do they even taste good?

My 6 year old can make his own sandwich and has been able to for a couple years. If he can manage it, your teens and AH husband can too.\n\nCooking strike is 100% valid here.

Obviously your husband needs to behave better and not make faces and complain.  Same with the kids.  They are old enough to be polite.

Has everyone been checked for allergies or overactive poison response (not too sure how to express that in English, but normally, tastebuds only react to high and actually dangerous amounts of toxic substances, however, if these tastebuds are oversensitive, they might also detect small, harmless amounts of toxic substances that are normal in lots of receipes and the body will react with a poisoning response. It's assumed to have a genetic component.). Both of these things can lead to the throat closing or narrowing, gagging and physical pain whilst eating (and presumably weird faces). My brother, mother and grandfather and a cousin on my mothers side all have that, and it took ages to find out about it. \n\nSo your idea to let the affected people do the (or at least their) cooking (and omitting whatever they think they can't have) seems to be a good solution. For the late shifts - I don't think that it's the law anywhere to have the warm meal of the day in the evening and not in the morning / midday / whenever there is time, so maybe having a warm meal at another time of day would be an option? Also, if that's possible where you live - get your family seek medical evaluation for these issues, there really might be more to it than just entitlement or rudeness, and quality of life for everyone could be improved with a diagnosis.", "NTA - why did you and the 10 yo tolerate this for so long !  Why don't you 2 cook normal food and let the other 2 fend for himself.\n\nYou have been sainted in putting up with this nonsense from your husband and your eldest.", "NTA. \n\nHe is complaining about lack of variety AND that you are trying new food.

So if it's a texture thing, or flavor, or ketchup would help, I work with that.

He eats exactly two kinds of pie: Raspberry and French Silk. But the Silk has to be on a Graham cracker crust with no whipped cream or chocolate curls, and the raspberry has to be a classic double-crust (no tart-style, crumble-top, or other cobbler-adjacent types).

Heck - even the little one can help, with supervision. Something easy for her, like soup and sandwiches on Sunday night, might be a step in the right direction. It won't necessarily fix your husband's complaint about variety, but it's a start to evening out the workload. \n\nI'm also thinking that if they understand the work that goes into the food, it may help with broadening their palates. \n\nJust suggestions of other ways to tackle the issue!", "so nta. bravo.

You are arresting their emotional development and encouraging antisocial behavior that will affect their lives negatively.

How many dinners will they ruin by making rude faces at a restaurant? How many friends will stop calling when they realize your child throws a nasty fit if someone doesn\u2019t kowtow to their preferences? What will happen the first time a date wants to cook them dinner? When they\u2019re meeting a potential in-law and immediately sour the relationship by gagging at what is served to them? Beyond food, tact is a skill they need to be taught, in general! How many friends will they lose because they\u2019re making faces about their friends\u2019 outfits, or gagging about who their friend is attracted to?
