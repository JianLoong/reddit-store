{"id": 12516, "submission_id": "11trxqv", "title": "AITA - Refusing to cook", "selftext": "I (41F) live with my husband (41M) and daughters (10, 17). Husband is a picky eater, which I've known about for 20 years.\n\nI'm used to making food and having husband and/or kids making faces, gagging, taking an hour to pick at a single serving, or just outright refusing to eat. My husband is notorious for coming home from work, taking one look at the dinner I've made, and opting for a frozen pizza.\n\nMost of the meals I make cater to their specific wants. Like spaghetti: 10F only eats the plain noodles. 17F eats the noodles with a scrambled egg on top, no sauce. Husband only eats noodles with a specific brand of tomato sauce with ground beef in it. If I use any other sauce (even homemade) I'm going to be eating leftovers for a week. So it's just the one recipe of spaghetti.\n\nThese days, husband complains that we have a lot of the same meals, over and over. It's true, but when I've explained WHY that's true, it doesn't seem to sink in. I can only make a few things that everyone in the family will reliably eat and those get old.\n\nA couple of nights ago I made a shepherd's pie. I used a new recipe with seasoned ground beef (3/3 like), peas (2/3 like), and tomatoes (1/3 like, 1/3 tolerate) with a turmeric-mashed potato top layer (2/3 will eat mashed potato). Predictably, 10F ate a single bite then gagged and ended up throwing hers away. 17F ate part of a single bowl then put hers in the trash. Husband came home late and \"wasn't hungry\".\n\nI was so tired of reactions to my food and putting in the effort for YEARS and it all finally came down on me at once. I burst into tears and cried all night and the next morning.\n\nSo I told my husband that I was done cooking. From here on out, HE would be responsible for evening meals. I would still do breakfast for the girls, and lunch when they weren't in school but otherwise it was up to him.\n\nHe said \"what about when I work late?\". I told him he needed to figure it out. I told him that between him and the girls, I no longer found any joy in cooking and baking, that I hated the way he and the girls made me feel when they reacted to my food, that I was tired of the \"yuck faces\" and refusals to eat when I made something new and that it broke my heart EVERY time.\n\nThis morning, he had to work, so he got up early to do some meal prep. He was clearly angry. He said he doesn't understand why \"\\[I\\] said I hated him\". He said he \"doesn't know what to do\" and thinks I'm being unfair and punishing him. He said I make things that \"don't appeal to kids\" sometimes and I can't expect them to like it when I make Greek-style lemon-chicken soup (17F enjoyed it, 10F and husband hated it). I countered that I make PLENTY of chicken nuggets, mac & cheese, grilled cheese, etc but that picky or not, there's such a thing as respect for a person's efforts.\n\nSo, Reddit: AITA?", "created_utc": 1679061658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11trxqv/aita_refusing_to_cook/", "score": 2119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have to experience what it is like to have to sort out their own meals, to everyone's liking. Then maybe they will be more appreciative of your efforts.", "If he can afford to be that picky, he needs to cater to himself. You\u2019re not a short-order cook, and no one is helping you. NTA. He knows what things he will eat; he should also know how to prepare them, not just how to make faces at what you prepare.", "NTA at all!!\n\nLots of people would\u2019ve refused to cook anymore, except maybe for the youngest, years ago. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown-up, he can figure it out and potentially deal with the same frustration you have faced all these years. Good luck to him.", "17 year old needs to learn to cook. When she goes to college or out into the world nobody is going to give a damn about her picky eating habits. She will shop/cook or starve.", "NTA. Since your husband is so picky, he should man up and cook for himself and the kids. Better yet, get the 17 year old to start cooking her own meals too. \n\nI\u2019d personally tell him if I was around that he and the children caused this and they reap what they sow. \n\nDo not cook for them again until it sinks in.", "NTA went through this with my husband and I stopped cooking for him - best decision ever.  I started making double of what I eat , he was given the choice of eat what's there or cook it yourself - if he doesn't eat it leftovers for me. He got tired of peanut butter sandwiches and started eating what I eat. If he complained I just said then don't eat it. He decided it was easier to not be picky and he now cooks in turn. Make what you want, put it down and if they hate it they can make it themselves- but you'll probably have to have a back up for the 10 yr old. And the 10 yr old is most likely following dad's example - stop catering to them!", "Absolutely NTA. They are all perfectly capable of preparing their own food and cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen. My husband will eat just about anything but my children learned quickly if they didn't like what I prepared for dinner, they were free to have a bowl of cereal. I was preparing one meal, not three.", "NTA.\n\nYou've sucked it up for years while they acted like you were going to poison them. They're all old enough to cook. (Yes, the 10YO as well, under supervision.) Let them make meals for a while.", "NTA. You have had the patience of a saint. Enough's enough already!", "NTA. \n\nThis was exhausting and irritating to just READ, I can't imagine actually *living* it. \n\nI would've done this years ago, honestly. And it's not even that they're picky, really, it's that they're so damn rude about it AND your husband has the audacity to complain about the lack of variety in the meals. \n\nNo, it's time for him to deal with feeding the the picky eaters in the house including himself. I suggest you start finding some delicious recipes for two for you to make, so you can cook and eat exactly what you want with a meal leftover, and no worries about feeding your ungrateful family.", "NTA.  This is a very difficult situation.  I'm sure you know the advice that you put the food out, and the children at the table choose what to eat.  \n\n\nIt's really disenheartening to make an effort to cook, and then have the food get rejected.  \n\n\nThere are several issues here:  \n\n\n1. no one should be gagging or otherwise rude about the food being served.  If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it, but they need to be polite.\n2. Everyone in the household needs to help with meal prep.  Your husband is a grown ass adult, and he needs to be able to prepare a few meals.  The children are old enough to start helping with making dinner.  The 17 year old will be an adult soon, and should absolutely be able to make a complete meal, without much supervision.  The ten year old should be able to do a lot of the steps.\n\nLuckily, there's a solution to all of these problems.  You are no longer the cook for the family.  Instead, the family is going to have a schedule by which everyone in the house will make dinner once or twice per week.\n\nThey're going to be 100% accountable for that one or two dinners.  That means that on Sunday, there's going to be a family meeting.  Everyone will put their food needs on the shopping list, so that whatever they need will be stocked.  You will also buy a few emergency back up items (bread, peanut butter, yogurt, etc.) so that everyone has \\*something\\* they can fall back to, if they absolutely cannot eat what is on offer.  \n\n\nAdditionally, whoever cooks dinner is not the person who cleans up.    \n\n\nGet a big ol' wall calendar, and you can either let people sign up for the days they want to do dinner, or you can literally roll dice to assign it.  \n\n\nEither way, you are no longer a short order cook in this family.  \n\n\n(The suggestion I'm making here was implemented by a single dad and his two 11 year old sons, and those boys grew into adults who knew how to cook and how to clean up a kitchen.)", "NTA. You have more patience than me. I can't believe your husband complained about not having variety in his meals.  Everyone can cook something. If you eat and  read you can follow a basic recipe. It may take a few tries but it's possible.\nTeaching your kids and husband to cook for themselves is not a bad thing.\n\nI would buy frozen food for them to eat and cook for just myself.", "NTA. My 14 year old was an insanely picky eater and I spent a decade cooking gross basic food and lost all the joy of cooking. When he turned 13 I laid down the law - I cook what I like and every meal will have one basic element that I know he likes. If he's too picky to eat the rest of dinner he can make a sandwich or cup of noodles or have fruit. It took a few months and now he eats without complaint. You are a couple decades late doing this for your husband, but he is capable of learning. \n\nIf you can afford it, make the meals you want but enough for everyone. I think after a few weeks of whatever bland ass crap your husband manages to pull together, people will slowly drift towards your cooking.", "My sibs and I (mostly boys) could cook before we were 17. We each had things we liked to make, and together we could make a meal. Mom (who was a very good,  from scratch cook) let us have at it. She had been the baby of the family and her big brothers didn't want to eat her cooking, so she learned to cook after she got married.", "Good Christ NTA everyone is old enough to make their own damn food at this point. You're their mom and wife not a short order cook.", "NTA. I can understand why you\u2019d be fed up. \n\nI don\u2019t understand your husband\u2019s complaint about \u201cwhat if I work late?\u201d He already has no problem pulling a pizza out of the freezer when he gets home from work. He just doesn\u2019t want the responsibility. \n\nAlso - treat yourself. Go away for a weekend, by yourself or with a friend. It doesn\u2019t have to be lavish. But you need to do something for YOU. This will also let your family get a sense of what it\u2019s like cooking for them.", "Why are you coddling these people? The children are going to grow up to be unbearable just like your husband. Cook whatever you want, and if they don't like it, they can be fuckin hungry. NTA.", "Without detail, I'm leaning toward NTA.\n\nHubs and 17f can absolutely cook for themselves at this point, and unless you don't work at all, and you are the homemaker for your family, the OTHER PARENT has some feeding responsibilities towards their picky-eating children themselves. \n\nDetails I'm interested in are you and your husband's work schedules and other household/family chores, INCLUDING any child care/transport. If you're a f/t homemaker, I do view not cooking as not doing part of your job, but if you have ANY outside employment your husband shouldn't put the entire burden of cooking on you.\n\n[EDIT: Rereading this, I see where people are misunderstanding my phrasing, and I apologize for being unclear. \n\nI'm not gonna edit the original, but I meant that ONLY  in a full and agreed-to \"home/out-of-home\" division of labor between partners could I imagine one partner having zero cooking responsibility for their own kids that they live with.\n\nIn that sort of agreement on labor division of labor, cooking MAY have well been a pre-agreed responsibility about taking care of children's basic needs.\n\nIF that was the case (it is not) and if her job were to take care of the home, and that included feeding the minor kids, and she's literally at the house all the time, and feeding the kids was what she chose to stop doing to balance her workload (as opposed to, say, scrubbing the bathtub or something less vital-to-life) and she knew her husband was physically not home to cook for the children, that VERY SPECIFIC SITUATION would have made it an ESH. \n\nI brought up if she worked because that was a simple way to rule that one super-specific possibility out and gain insight that could help her find ways to improve the situation for her family.]", "NTA all power to you.", "NTA.

Some parents make their kids eat what\u2019s on the plate, others don\u2019t, etc. My parents would be fine if I didn\u2019t eat what they made as long as I took care of what I was going to eat instead.\n\nI feel bad because I\u2019ve been a picky eater too, especially when younger, and also often didn\u2019t eat the meals my mom made. I tried to keep her feelings from getting hurt, but did I? I tried, but still\u2026 I\u2019d usually try a bite of it at least, and if I didn\u2019t like it (she\u2019d often ask), I\u2019d say something like \u201cI can tell it\u2019s a good [whatever dish it was], but it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t like [that dish, or some characteristic of it like being super spicy, etc.].\u201d (Meaning that for someone who liked that dish, they would love it; it wasn\u2019t how she made the food that was the problem, it was just the dish itself.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t it throw away however. I\u2019d let someone else have it, and I might say \u201cAt least this way there\u2019s more for you (who like it),\u201d as in, the food will be eaten by someone who likes it this way. \n\nWe reached a sort of compromise: I didn\u2019t complain about what she made and she didn\u2019t have to make dishes that I\u2019d like (for example, it was fine for her to make seafood even though we both know that\u2019s something I don\u2019t like), and she wouldn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d me to learn to love what she made. (Example: when she made seafood, she didn\u2019t force me to eat any of it).\n\nAs for the faces your kids make, I would (if you haven\u2019t said it to them before) tell them that it hurts your feelings when they do that. Since their dad does it too, they might not realize that you\u2019re not okay with it. Not that it\u2019s an excuse but it may help going forward.", "NTA.

Big fam here, and while it is a bit demoralizing when there is only a handful of meals that \\*everyone\\* will eat, there needs to be some expectation management. Currently, it's \\*you catering to everyone's wants & nothing of them taking ownership of their own behaviors. \n\nI think your spouse doing the cooking for a bit, will set you up nicely, if you choose to go back to making meals. \n\nMy own \"goal\" was meals that at least half of the family liked.  If we got to 80%, approval, I was thrilled.  I often had meals that went well with plain rice/pasta/veggies, and very few 1-pot meals. We almost always have plain rice or pasta in the fridge, and ramen in the cabinet.  If someone didn't like \\*anything of the meal, they were free to eat leftovers or cook their own.  I am not even making a quesadilla.  They can do that themselves.  Even little guys can make a pb&j or ham sandwich.  They may feel a bit left out on a nice, hot dinner, but whatever...they'll learn to enjoy their sad dinner or eat more adventurously. \n\nBut mostly, it goes like this: Say we have swedish meatballs w/rice, veggies on the side.  Like 2 people with eat veggies, all but one will eat the rice, one of them \\*only eating the rice  One will eat the meatballs without the sauce (so I'll put some meatballs to the side before finishing up).  The one that only eats the rice, will go in the fridge to put some cheese on top.  Whatever, we're good. That's a WIN. Even if only half are really \"happy\" with the meal as a whole, everyone had something hot to eat. \n\nWhile I don't cook stuff only one or two of us will eat for dinner, I \\*will make those things for lunch.  Lunch is a free-for-all, and everyone is responsible for their own.  My youngest is now 12, but it has been like this for a few years.

Throwing away food is a horrible thing to do in general especially in these times of high food prices. Do you compost?

We ended up just not having them over as much because we lived out of town and my parents didn\u2019t want to have to do a specific grocery shop just so I could have a friend over for the afternoon. I had a roommate in college who only ate boiled chicken and boiled canned peas and corn and rice and potatoes. But she didn\u2019t stop there; she also threw out my stuff or scoffed at my perfectly normal food. It ended up embarrassing her in quite a few situations when she was called out for being unnecessarily judgemental, sheltered, limited her experience with food.

I usually try to incorporate little things to my regular meals (like adding green onions to my Mac and cheese lol), gives a little variety without compromising on foods I like.

I\u2019ve seen it in families, kids pick up picky eating from a parent or sibling and then you are screwed.  They are all old enough to learn to make something they will eat.  I was younger than 13 when I was taught to make something for myself because there were a couple dishes my mom cooked that so could not stand and she didn\u2019t have to make more than one dinner.

On the flip side we were also often in nice restaurants eating amazing food there too as booth kids.   My parents had one good rule about food is that you had to try everything at least once (fresh oysters for example).  I would never in a million years dream of rejecting food like your kids did.

Do any of them have genuine food aversions or are they spoiled?  IF they have food aversions, then it may not be able to be helped  All 3 of my kids are AuDHD & along with that comes food issues.  I came from a home where you ate what was put in front of you & survived.  I was also government cheese poor but my mom was a fantastic creative cook who could stretch a dollar.  I thought I'd be the same with my kids.  Having a kid scream & cry all night long because they were hungry but literally could not eat the food you'd served them for dinner broke me of that notion.  Instead I educated myself on food aversion, saw a dietician & work with them to make sure they get the needed calories & don't go hungry.  My oldest was in the 1% for weight.  That's more than pickiness we've got him up to around 5%.  We do introduce new foods & try to expand their palates.  Success varies.  Sometimes we made two separate meals.  Sometimes we make a meal that everyone will eat different elements (plain spaghetti for two, spaghetti with meatballs for the third) & there are a few winning meals we all will eat.  I could not have survived this if my DH also had food issues & was an ass about it.  He's an adult & can help you plan & execute a meal plan.  I'd also involve the kids in meal planning.

Your family wants to complain about meals all being the same and boring, while also complaining whenever you try something new. Your response was perfect and honestly was due WAY sooner than this. You laid it out pretty clearly. If your family isn't going to eat the meals you make, and what's worse they're going to show clear blatant disgust and disrespect towards your efforts, then fuck it you don't have to cook for them. It's not like it was ever your duty to do the meals.\n\nA couple extra points:\n\n1. Personally, if it were me, I'd even just start cooking dinners just for you. You clearly enjoy a wide variety of food and like to explore new options, and if you're already committed to having the rest of the family manage their own dinners (absolutely reasonable, again as I said above), then you might as well occasionally try smaller recipes just for yourself. And who knows, maybe you can get your family to occasionally try small bites to see if they like it and maybe work back to making meals for them again, IF that's something you have any interest in, which leads to:\n\n2. While I don't ever want to discount that many people can be picky eaters or even just have specific food aversions (especially at younger ages), based on your daughters' reactions, I think it might be more of a learned behaviour than genuine dislike or pickiness. They both seem incredibly comfortable with showing a frankly absurd amount of disgust, and throwing meals away, on a seemingly regular basis without even a concern for your feelings or efforts.\nI think they're mostly picking this behaviour up from your husband and feeling emboldened by him. Even if this isn't true though, your husband really really needs to be freaking talked to. He's acting like a damn child and the only thing that I think his longstanding history of pickiness truly says is that he's not actually picky, he's just stubborn and close minded. \n\nSo anyway yeah! I sympathize with you pretty hard, my family has a similar lack of interest in the food I try to make (but I'm not cooking *for* family, just occasionally around them, my parents and siblings) and I just decided a long time ago that I'd rather put in my own effort to make food I really enjoyed than be stifled by my family's pickiness.\n\nOnce again NTA, and I hope for the best for you, I'm sorry your family has been treating you this way for so long", "Nope!

But to have responses like gagging and making faces over and over and over for meals you work at to prepare, your whole family is being disrespectful to you.

Then planning alternative meals is the best solution, though again that should be on everyone, not just you.

I am not necessarily a fan of \"eat what I cook or don't eat,\" but there is a line and all of your family members are crossing it. Your husband and eldest are old enough to understand why this is a problem, why it is hurtful, and how their behavior is exhausting. The 10yo gets a pass because, obviously, little kids can't always think empathetically. The spaghetti example is a good one. I would literally say \"okay you all want it differently, you won't try eating each other's versions, so I'm going to boil the noodles and heat a sauce and the rest is up to you.\" Like... literally everything would need to be taco bar style, if that makes sense. You want an egg? You make the egg. You want ground beef? You cook it. I would get you halfway there.\n\nThat or eat a frozen meal. Honestly OP, stick to your guns. Start making servings of what you love to cook for 1 and tell them they're welcome to figure it out, especially the older two. If they're not even going to try new things and not act like children (except the one who is a child ofc) about a free meal, then they can make it work. They're not treating you like a person with feelings, they are treating you like an in-home chef they can boss around ad there's 0 gratitude. The only other thing I would suggest trying without compromising your very correct feelings is to say \"okay, why don't you two look up some recipes for next week? Find two each that you really think you'll like and I'll make them, but I'm not putting in all the effort anymore. And if you don't like it, then either eat it and suck it up or go grab a can of spaghetti-os.\"\n\nAnd a final thought: if the teenager and the hubby decide to live off frozen food and fast food... let that be on their dime.

I only know of three things that could cause it: ADHD, Autism, and ARFID.\n\nADHD and Autism both tend to come with sensory issues, though they aren't the same 'type' so to speak. With Autism it's that the food texture, taste, or smell can feel bad or wrong. In my experience, it usually makes me literally feel nauseous to try and eat things with a 'bad' or 'wrong' texture or taste.\n\nWith ADHD it's more that those things can be overwhelming or underwhelming, which makes it difficult to eat those types of things.\n\nARFID, however, is the one I'm honesty more leaning towards. It stands for Avoidant-Restrictive-Food-Intake-Disorder. It's relatively new, I think. You can probably learn more about it here: [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/arfid](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/arfid)\n\nWhile I think ARFID may be more likely, don't dismiss Autism or ADHD as impossible. Girls actually usually show vastly different symptoms, or present those symptoms differently, than boys. If you go to look up the symptoms, try putting in 'Girl ADHD/Autism' instead of just ADHD and just Autism. Also, maybe try to find some personal stories from women with ADHD or Autism. They may be able to explain some things in a way that normal google can't.\n\nThere also may be other similar things that can cause pickiness to such an extreme, but I don't know what they could be. You're kids also really could just be that picky, which is being enabled by their dad essentially doing the same thing as they are. It honestly could be any of these things.", "Oh no.

Being a homemaker IS WORK, so if that's the job she agreed to do to support the family while her partner leaves to get cash income, and it's balanced in that fashion, her not doing part of it would have been something that required renegotiating, which is totally normal as familys grow and age. It would require a different tactic to get what she needs fairly, but knowing how their home works is important to giving useful advice, so I asked.\n\nHere's the thing about gagging/faces at food: LOTS of folks have taste and texture sensitivities and don't have control over what their reactions are. Picky eaters are often neurodiverse and experience actual suffering at some things you might just think of as unappetizing. \n\nYou're right - the disrespect is one thing. But having food sensitivities isn't disrespect. It's just a biological difference. The only disrespect I see here is Hubs' refusal to acknowledge that his wife is cooking a minimum of two different dinners a night, that he doesn't try to help, and that he feels it's appropriate to critique her labor's variety. Which is about the WORK, not about the food. People are allowed to not like foods as long as they take the responsibility to work around that distaste themselves.", "I mean.

It doesn't give the right to be rude about it AT ALL, but the reaction itself is valid, and Mom here is cool AF to acknowledge the issue her kids have. The rudeness issue isn't the gagging. It happens, and it sucks for the person gagging just as much as the person who put the effort to cook in. I'm super hesitant to characterize that part as rude.\n\nThe rudeness comes mostly from Dad's comaints about variety, because it's just whiny and unappreciative in this situation. It's OK to dislike food and be unable to swallow, but you have to be considerate and respectful about it and willing to help yourself find food you CAN eat. A 10yo is ready to learn this, the 17yo needs to learn this, and the husband should have learned this a long time ago. \n\nI've kept saying, over and over, that Mom/OP is NTA. But not being the asshole doesn't make the situation better for anyone. \n\nWhether or not she works is actually really important when you look at rebalancing the division of labor in families. So no, this doesn't excuse family rudeness, and no, she is NTA. But her time available is part of the big picture. So I asked if she worked.", "Boo fucking Hoo, the kids didn\u2019t like it.

I remember going to my cousins and her mom saying she would make kraft dinner and being heartbroken when they brought out a homemade Mac and cheese that wasn't good but I still ate it all and didn't say anything till I went home.\n\nI also discovered I loved Bortch this way (idk how you spell it but the soup with beets) went to a friend's and they had canned bortch and showed me how to warm it up.

So there's that. \n\nAlso, everyone keeps harping on the family reactions as rude. Again, if you can't eat tomatoes because they make you gag, that's a food sensitivity that tons of (very frequently undiagnosed) neurodiverse (ADHD, ASD, OCD, etc) people have, and it impacts neurotypical people to different degrees as well. I reject the gagging as rude, because I know what it's like to have totally reasonable food in your mouth and be unable to make yourself swallow. It really, really sucks. \n\nThe Dad is being an asshole in his demands for other reasons, and I do keep saying Mom is NTA for refusing to keep cooking.

You're right - tons of people can and do control dislikes of food, and even sensitivities. And I never said it was an excuse for rudeness. I'm just saying it's not rudeness ITSELF. There are two big issues with what you just wrote:\n\nOne - Sensitivities of this type are not perceptible outside the head of the person who has them, at all, and they come in all types and scopes. Some folks can swallow, others truly can't. Just because some folks who use wheelchairs CAN walk doesn't mean it's easy or that we should force them to. I think it's cool AF that Mom has been accommodating so far, but I also see that it's a ton of work that she can't do on her own anymore. She's in no way the asshole to limit her cooking to breakfast/lunch/snacks for the girls. \n\nTwo - please consider that I, along with my ND counterparts, am more tired of being neurodivergent than you could possibly be about hearing how it affects our lives, and complaining that other people have it hard and that you're tired of hearing about it is incredibly narcissistic.

Myself and one of the friends ate ours silently, the other? Not so much. She learned mushrooms were in it and went on a rampage about how stupid and nasty mushrooms were. She asked him why he would cook with such a thing and why he'd even let her have it (this was her first time ever seeing this man).\n\nNeedless to say, I never got lasagna from him again.

She can make toast, sandwiches, mac and cheese - open a tuna can/packet and add it to the mac.  In fact, we all take turns or there are days when they cook for themselves.  I provide the food, it is up to them to cook it.  I started teaching all of my kids when they were about 8-9.  Best thing ever I did.  I work and dealing with everyone liking or not liking food is draining.  Plus, eventually these kids need to move out - they need to know how to cook, clean and take care of themselves.  Does that mean I never cook, or I make them clean everything - no.  I don't make my kids feed me nor clean up after me - just care for themselves.  I do cook - but share the cooking during the work week.  On weekends I am the one who provides dinner.  Breakfast - half the time.  Lunch - nope.  Corn dogs, hot dogs, already made salads, yogurt, fruit and veggies (raw), lunch meat and cheese (I got a sandwich maker - think hot pockets - kids love it).  One will have grilled cheese, another does swiss and roast beef, another ham with cheddar.  But I also taught them it is rude to trash talk food - meaning if we go out to someone's home - they eat what is there.  They don't make rude comments.\n\nAs to your husband - tell him to grow the F up.  Honestly, he is too old to be acting like a spoiled child.  You are his wife not his mother.  He wants food made his way - he needs to visit his mama or Wendy's.  When I got married and had kids - everyone at what was on their plate or went without until the next meal.

I always tell him \"If you want to put mushrooms in, that's ok! I can eat around them.\" Same goes for olives. If he wants seafood, he makes it, and I have something else. We're both really really flexible. And while I do get some light teasing, I we don't actually outright fight about it, and it's not an issue in our relationship. \n\nThis is because of a few factors: \n\n* I'm grateful to be cooked for so generously, and I show it all the time. I say thank you at every meal, I always tell him what I loved about it, and I do my best to do other things for him to show my appreciation. \n* I'm flexible, and always open to making my own adjustments if he wants something I don't like. If he wants prawns, i'll throw a sausage or two on the BBQ with them for myself. \n* I TRY THINGS! He'll try me out on something every now and then just to check. He always communicates it, like \"I'm putting mushrooms in the spaghetti sauce\". Either they're so small I don't notice, and don't mind (it's a texture thing), or they're nice and big and I can eat around them if I choose. But still I try them, even just to confirm that I still don't like them. \n* If he proposes something for dinner that I don't like, he never EVER gets a yuck face, or back talk in return about it. NEVER. \n* If I don't like something he's made, I tell him, but kindly. Even then I am still always grateful, and I also make suggestions on how I think it could be better. Like if something's too spicy, \"Maybe next time let's add some sour cream\" or if it's too salty \"It's a bit salty, but I also like the flavor of this part\".

His rudeness comes mostly after her pouring her heart out that for her cooking is more than practical, and that asking her to cook varied meals that somehow also magically appeal to the kids he knows are picky is what's rude because it's an impossible request, logically. \n\nBeing a picky eater or having food sensitivity isn't an insult to a cook. It's sad because she puts all this work and love into it that is going unappreciated because her family doesn't share her tastes. It's unfortunate, not rude. \n\nHis continued complaints after repeated explanation about what is and isn't possible in reality, and after she puts all this heart and work in, is what I find rude about this.", "LOL, my first reaction to this was that it sounds awesome and I want to try it. I'm sorry your family doesn't appreciate you efforts. I know it probably won't make you feel better, but I think my family will love it. Thank you for the suggestion!", "This pickiness sounds like the logic puzzle from hell. \ud83d\ude28", "No, that was a silly thing to do, and a bad parenting move.  OP seems to have gone for at least 16 years without teaching her kids good manners, and for longer than that without telling her husband that his reactions hurt her.  She... shouldn't have.\n\nBut she doesn't get to appoint her husband the cook, anymore than her husband had the right to appoint her the cook.  It's none of her business whether he cooks or not, for himself alone or for the older kid.  All she is responsible for at this point is making sure the younger kid has access to food and the older kid has grocery money for herself.", "Exactly.  No one is going to find their food pickiness at all charming.  These kids will have a rude shock when they enter the adult world and nobody wants to cater to them.", "You'd be surprised. I was friends with a guy in college. Dudes diet consisted of Costco chicken sandwiches and subway Buffalo chicken sandwiches (plain with just cheese). Maybe some Dino nuggs and Kraft. Disliked everything else, especially anything with a texture. He somehow found something to eat everywhere we went, mostly off the kids menu. It was so wild to me.", "I'm not literally saying to starve them. They need to realize they have to eat what is available. That's why they are entitled or spoiled and don't value the job mom do to feed them. She cried over this, they can feed themselves if they want", "I'm the same age as OPs oldest and yes I agree in public getting food for picky eaters is easy(I don't put veggies on my burgers, idk why it feels wrong to do, lol) but the comments aren't necessary and are very rude. Especially in a fancier restaurant.", "Tbf professional chefs rarely make food that's bad. \n\n100% agree that it's rude and OP shouldn't put up with it but the comments in this thread that they're in for a rude awakening as adults might not be true. \n\nMost lay people are mediocre and it's not outrageous to find one particular lay persons cooking bad. \n\nMy entire childhood people told me I was a 'super picky' eater because I was always meh on the food my dad and stepmother cooked, though I liked stuff my mom made. I'd noticeably lose weight every time I spent long visits with my dad because he had an \"eat it or starve\" policy and starvation was to me clearly the better option. I didn't make faces, but they were upset that I'd take a few bites and decide to starve. \n\nBut then I became an adult and started eating food made at a whole variety of restaurants, cafeteria at work, food I made, food friends or other people made, and it turned out I wasn't that picky. I just really didn't like their cooking. As an adult I still find it barely edible.", "Hmm, sounds good. I've only had it boiled.", "Try baking Brussels sprouts in the over with a little Teriyaki sauce.  I also did not know broccoli was in the same family as cabbage.", "Brussels Sprout steamed, then fried in garlic butter.  Delicious!", "Yea, that's what I learned. I used to only eat ravioli or Mac. There was actually a time that I didn't like chicken nuggets \ud83e\udd2f. Legit don't even know why. I'm definitely not as bad when it comes to food as I used to be.", "Exactly. I have nieces and nephews, and while I'm not a big fruit or veggies fan, I'll eat them while they are around to encourage them to do the same. I do this with all the meats we eat as well. I'm not big on seafood, but I'll eat it, and they will copy me, obviously not eating as much since they are all under ten but still.", "The epitome of white people shit.", "Because women have been manipulated into serving their husband at the expense of themselves through generations of emotional abuse. That's why you see the same strategies time and time again. They will feign adoration \"but you're so great at it!\", they'll pretend that women are just born to know these things, and if they're forced to do the work that they see as beneath them they will either outright refuse or will make it as painful on her as possible to force compliance. It's abuse. It's just so ingrained in our culture it's overlooked. Girls are raised to believe that sacrificing their own needs and wants is a virtue, boys are raised to see women's work as punishment. The control was easier when women couldn't have jobs or bank accounts and believed the lie that running a family was far easier than the pressures of a career. The control is still there, however, and many men succeed in their career because the mental and physical toll of running their life is shoved onto a woman whose career suffers but is deemed less important.", "I don't disagree with anything you said but the fact that so many women have to parent their husbands this way for them to *maybe* give a shit is just baffling to me. Like on one hand yes excusing and catering to being exploited doesn't help, but you should not be tasked with teaching a grown man empathy either.", "Absolutely this!!!!!!! \n\nI'm a healthcare professional that assists families in the management of ARFID (Avoidadant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). \n\nI cannot (and will not) diagnose someone over reddit, but I will say that it is extremely rare for a child age 10 pr an adult to be gagging at most meals, without there being some sort of sensory condition in play.\n\nDo you and your husband have an otherwise happy marriage? If so, I'd definitely look into ARFID further, because its unlikely to be a (conscious) manipulation tactic. You do not need to have autism/be autistic or have ADHD to be assessed for ARFID - if unmanaged, it will continue into adulthood. \n\nARFID changes our neural hormonal pathways. Quite literally, when these pathways interact with stretch receptors in our stomach or GI tract, this sets of the stress response (fight or flight), often extreme levels of anxiety and disharmony between the brain and tummy - these systems are literally working opposite to how they would in you or I. \n\nIt's not a case of simply 'picky eating.' Often, people with ARFID are hungry, but the normal changes that occur in the body during periods of hunger actually \ncauses such a fear of eating that they're physically unable to eat new/different textures, or their stomach size has changed and is unable to have food in it, or they will automatically start gagging when forced to eat, in order to void something - which typically only happens when something is poisonous!!!\n\nIf someone with ARFID is served and forced to eat food (for fear of consequences) that they cannot tolerate, you betcha they'd be gagging. I've had kids vomit during sessions where I was just observing mealtimes and parents were showing me how 'rude' their child is. It's not on purpose. And it creates trauma. \n\nPlease please please have your children and husband assessed. \n\nYou are NTA regardless. And there's no reason your husband can't take over the cooking (assuming he is able to touch food). But something needs to be done to identify the root cause of this problem, whether its simply rude and picky eating or a medical condition. Either way, this needs to be addressed - otherwise you will be TA to yourself and family.", "And yes, she did quit, and no, she's not the asshole here, which I said repeatedly.", "But she did? She even stated in another comment that she's spoken about it for years. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back.", "except in this case it isn't about the food being mediocre. it's about not liking this or that specific ingredient and acting like OP is the devil incarnate for using it in her cooking. from what it seems like, they expect OP to cook every day, and then complain if she makes anything that they don't like, so she's restricted to a small rotation of things that she can rely on them enjoying \u2014 and then they complain that she only cooks a few different things!\n\ngiven that her husband's go-tos are frozen pizza and fast food, i get the feeling that they don't eat out at restaurants much because of the picky eating problem, which means it's not that OP's food is mediocre, it's that her family has very specific and restrictive tastes (and are unwilling to even try new things) and they then act like it's *her* fault that they refuse to eat most of the food she makes", "Cabbage (red, white, green), wombok, collard greens, kohlrabi, kale, brussel sprouts, savoy cabbage, gai lan, broccoli, broccolini, cauliflower!\n\nNot only are they the same family, they're all the same species. Like wolves and dogs.\n\nAnd thanks I'll try that with the teriyaki!", "I eventually learned that I had oral allergy syndrome from a lot of environmental allergies and once I got allergy shots learned to eat a lot more foods I had avoided, unconsciousky because they provoked allergies", "Powdered turmeric does not have a very strong flavour. Especially if it's just regular quality from the supermarket.\n\nFresh turmeric does. But in much of the west, it's difficult to get fresh turmeric.", "I never understood the DH thing. Why not just say my husband? Who started this? It just makes me think of baseball.", "I 100% agree btw that in the fact pattern here her kids and husband are rude AF and she should stop cooking for them. \n\nBUT I also thought I didn't like a lot of ingredients growing up because of *how my stepmother cooks them*. I thought broccoli was the grossest thing ever because she always boiled it for hours. \nUntil my mom convinced me to let her try to feed it to me and cook it differently. It turns out I *love* broccoli roasted or fried or lightly boiled. \n\nAs an adult I cook for myself and I find a lot of joy in ingredients I used to despise because I'm cooking it like a recipe taught me to and not how my stepmother made it. But as a child I was eating chicken nuggets and pizza when visiting my dad because anything more intricate cooking wise was (and still is) impalatabe to me.", "This is the case. She went through a list of ingredients and listed who liked what for what dish and then pointed out who threw it away. I feel bad for OP, and she's making the right call.", "I\u2019m in my 50\u2019s recall seeing DH used in women\u2019s magazines as a kid, so it\u2019s origins are pre internet and probably older than me", "I think it started with r/justnoMIL but I'm not positive. I know they use it there", "It's been around in wedding and mommy forums for a very very long time.", "It's really dumb.", "I\u2019ve seen it all over the internet, not just Reddit. If it started there that\u2019s impressive spread", "You\u2019re putting a lot of fantasy into your comment: \u201cthat sounds gross\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=shepherd's%20pie%20recipe%20with%20tumeric\n\nPlenty of recipes exist.", "No it's a lot older than justnoMIL. It's older than reddit, and even older than the internet. There's a set of acronyms that advice columnists and newspaper and magazine writers have been using for decades when talking about family matters. DH, DW, SIL, MIL, etc are all part of that set.\n\nThe thing that did come from justnoMIL is BEC (bitch eating crackers).\n\nJesus I'm old.", "With all due respect, making faces isn't the same as gagging...  \nBut I offer you this:  \nI also have misophonia and I will bet that, like me, you do have a facial reaction for a nanosecond.   \nThat's your gagging. And then you control yourself because you know it's your problem.  \n\n\nA person gagging over food can be made up but if that's all they do, I would not consider it rude. Real gagging is an involuntary reflex and it's equally rude for you to decide on your own whether they meant it as an insult or could not help it.   \n\n\nOP's family sounds beyond rude about it though. FWTW.", "So, I\u2019m talking about this in the context of this family, because that\u2019s what the question is about. They are rude and need to learn to control it. They\u2019ve been allowed to be rude to their mother, who loves them and tries her best to accommodate them, by their dad, who is the person I\u2019m most irritated by. \n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any diagnosis mentioned that would change my mind. If I know someone has a food sensory issue, rest assured I\u2019m asking a million questions because I don\u2019t want to serve them food that overloads them. I\u2019m not heartless, I promise. \n\nI did say that you can\u2019t control the sensory issue, but you can control the reaction. So yeah, I definitely make little twinges here and there, but I had to work on not being a jerkface when it overloads me. As I\u2019m sure you also do."]}
