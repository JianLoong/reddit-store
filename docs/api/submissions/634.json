I recently had a CPS case opened against someone who lives under the same roof as my mom, so I had to move into my grandmother's house. She's around 80-87 years old, and she is very kind, so there's not too much reason to ignore her. I've been staying in my room for prolonged periods and hardly leaving for things to drink. With CPS coming into my life, I've had to practically relive my trauma or think about it for four or five days a week, which is hard on my mental state. I do love my grandmother a bunch since she raised me for a good part of my life, but sometimes leaving the room just seems too hard and I can't get out of bed. I've been dealing with depression for a good 4-5 years, and it sort of always made me less motivated to do anything, even simple tasks. \n\nThe other day, I asked her for permission to walk to the park close to our block, since it's nice to try and get outside once in a while and I find the prospect of being alone and away from everything relaxing, even if it was just for an hour. \n\nShe told me I'm not allowed to go because I refuse to spend time with her. I've explained to her on many occasions that I'm a teenager and most teenagers are like this, and that part of what I'm going through is wanting to be alone for a while to process everything. \n\nWhen I do try to talk to her, it's like meeting an old friend from high school. She talks about random things that I'm not interested in, and it gets very awkward. She usually ends each conversation by telling me to clean the kitchen, which adds another layer of unpleasantness, but I can understand that somewhat.\n\nWhenever I do spend time with her, she plays on her phone and doesn't talk to me, which is fine for the most part, but due to my trauma, I feel safer in a smaller space with a deadbolt lock on it. So I don't have to worry about anybody coming from anywhere to harm me, yes, I'm kinda paranoid, but it's better to be cautious.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nI'm going to ask her if I can go to the park again later today and I'll let you know what she says.", "created_utc": 1667141905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhgc50/aita_for_not_spending_enough_time_with_my/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your grandmother probably needs some therapy, too.\n\nInfo: why is your mom harboring a person who\u2019s the direct cause for you, her daughter, to be forced out of the home? Why isn\u2019t your mom kicking this person out?", "NTA. Have you told her what you have told us?", "NTA.  but what if you asked her to go to the park with you?  Two birds with one stone.  Then maybe later you can get permission to go alone.   Good luck.", "NTA and I'm so sorry for everything you're going through and has happened in your life. \n\nJust try to talk to her again, gently, and try to get her to see your side of it. She's up there in years and they get stubborn at that age, trust me, I know. They have this very old school way of thinking that isn't right and drives me crazy.", "NTA im sorry you are going through so much shit and got no one who tries to understand and support you how in ways you need \n\nIts a very frustrating part of being a minor and sadly i dont think that will change any time soon, adults are quick to dismiss a minors feelings and needs \n\nIm glad you will be going to therapy soon, do you have one on one conversations with CPS about the situation? If yes maybe talk to them about different living options\n\nI wish you the best and a lot of strength and courage, dont ever stop advocating for your own needs, you deserve to be listened to", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My parents made me wish I had been though. I'm sorry and I hope CPS gets you counseling (ask and they will probably set it up, you could even do telehealth version from home probably). Ask grandma to go to park with you maybe? Or ask if you can go if you clean the kitchen the next day for her? Otherwise maybe just walk around the yard if she has one? I agree if you feel like being outside you should be. I wish I could actually help.", "I am going to therapy soon, and my grandma refuses to go.
