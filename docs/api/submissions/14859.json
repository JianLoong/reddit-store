And now, your sisters are on the fence about going because they don't want to exclude her.\r  \n\r  \nWell, here's what I think, honey. It's YOUR WEDDING, not A's. You have every right to invite or not invite whoever the fuck you want. If your sister A has caused problems and drama in the past, why the hell would you want her there on your special day? And as for your other siblings, they need to grow some balls and stop using mental health as an excuse for bad behavior. It's not fair to you or anyone else in the family.\r  \n\r  \nSo, no, you're not the asshole here. Your sister A needs to learn that actions have consequences, and you don't owe her anything just because she's family. Don't let her ruin your wedding or your happiness. If your other family members can't support your decision, then maybe it's time to re-evaluate those relationships.
