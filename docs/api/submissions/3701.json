I dropped out of school at 14, hung out with the wrong crowd and then got addicted to cocaine and alcohol at 14. I went to rehab at 20 but then relapsed and I just recently got out of rehab again. I stole and lied a lot to my family I will be honest, and they kicked me out (no better term but they\u2019re not the villains lol) at 15 and I haven\u2019t spoken much with them since. They had to get therapy because of me if that puts it into perspective.\n\nI have spoken with my brother (28M) a lot since I got out of rehab a few years ago, and he recently invited me to his his birthday party. He told me that my parents wouldn\u2019t be there and that only him, his girlfriend and a few of his friends will be there so I went. But my parents were there. They told me I should leave and that they\u2019re not ready to speak to me.\n\nMy brother told me not to leave but my parents looked really uncomfortable with me being there. They kept looking at me but nobody spoke to each other apart from what they said to me initially. I know it was my brother\u2019s birthday but I haven\u2019t seen my parents for years and I won\u2019t lie I really fucked up when we did have a relationship. I last saw them when I was 17 and I technically broke into their house since I didn\u2019t live there anymore. They didn\u2019t call the police or anything but they made me promise I would never contact them again.\n\nThis morning my brother also sent me texts from my parents saying that my brother should have warned them I would be there, and that they were very upset.\n\nAITA? I know it\u2019s my brother\u2019s birthday party but my parents have had it rough because of me. I feel really awful that I\u2019ve ruined this but I don\u2019t know.

Yes, you were an asshole in your past, and it sounds like you caused them a significant amount of trauma, but it also sounds like you\u2019re very remorseful about it so you must have learned from what you did and feel bad about it.\n\nThe asshole here is your brother. He\u2019s the cause of the issue- not because he invited you, but because he didn\u2019t notify your parents, so you didn\u2019t intend to cause any problems or make anyone uncomfortable. He also lied to you and said your parents wouldn\u2019t be there when that\u2019s clearly not the case.\n\nAll around, your brother shouldn\u2019t lie to people and should learn how to actually communicate. That might solve the problems he is causing.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your brother invited you. Your parents should have spoken to your brother not you. The whole background does not matter to being the AH or not. \n\nBesides, the addiction started when you were a teen and they were responsible for you. You made your decisions but you were just a teen and could not oversee the situation. They should have helped you when you were 14. They were responsible of you back then. So they are not peachy keen in this. I don\u2019t say they caused all the problems and stuff\u2026 \n\nI have seen this with my niece and nephew. Their parents did nothing either when they were teens. When they were adults they could do nothing anymore. \n\nI hope you will recover and stay on track. Maybe some family therapy will help you sort out some of this.\n\nNTA.", "First, congratulation on your recovery. Your life hasn't been easy so far, but I am glad you are making the right decision now. \n\nI understand that your parent must be stuck in the past, but you didn't stay there. You evolve. It's sad that they don't see all the efforts you are making. Also, I hope they realize that they failed you, and that they should be mad at themselves as much as they are mad at you.\n\nNTA. It was your brother's birthday and he wanted you there. He asked you to stay. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - you were invited under false pretenses, so if anyone is the AH it's your brother (albeit probably with good intentions). by blindsiding all of you, he was risking this scenario, or worse.", "NTA - Your brother shouldn't have set you and your parents up like that. If anyone is the asshole it's him.", "NTA. You were invited by your brother to his birthday and he told you that they weren't going to be there. If they were that uncomfortable, then they should have left.", "I'm going with NTA but sliding towards N A H \u2014 your bro wanted you there, and your parents didn't. It sounds like they have reason to be skeptical/hurt, and they have every right not to want to spend time with you if they're not ready. The fact that you are aware of their feelings, your part in them, and want to respect them shows how far you've come in your recovery, which is awesome. \n\nHOWEVER (and this is why I landed on NTA) it's not their party, and they don't get to decide who is invited or stays. They could have left, and decided not to do so. Moreover (and I'm sure you know this) one of the big things that helps with preventing relapses is having community and support, which your brother is offering you. Don't isolate yourself and risk your recovery to save your parents' feelings when you are not actively hurting them.", "NTA - it was your brother's house and event and he asked you to be there. If you parents didn't like that they could've left. \n\nIt sounds like your brother set it up on purpose to force you and your parents to reconnect, so if anyone is to blame for the situation it's him. \n\nIf you haven't had a chance maybe you can write your parents a letter to apologize for your past behavior and ask have your brother pass it on, since you obviously feel guilty about it.", "NTA your brother should have let them know that you were coming so they had the choice to not show up. That's not your fault. Once they saw you, they could have left.\n\nHonestly no one ends up an addict for no reason. They probably don't wanna see you because they blame themselves which they should", "NTA \n\nas a recovering addict myself, you have every right to be there and show them a new you! your past doesn\u2019t define you anymore, you are a new person now", "NTA, your brother wanted you there.  Im sorry your parents failed you as a child.  There is no way Im going to call a minor / child struggling with addiction and homelessness an AH.  You deserved better than that and it sounds like your brother understands that.", "NTA - Your parents don't have to have a relationship with you and they can choose to not be around you. But that does not mean that they have a right to kick you out of places that you are otherwise allowed/invited to be. You had every right to be there. If they didn't want to be around you, then it was on them to leave.", "NTA.  Your brother\u2019s the one who fucked up here: it sounds like he got it into his head he could fix things between you if he just got you in the same place, and unfortunately it turns out life doesn\u2019t just automatically produce happily ever afters because people want them.  Or maybe he just didn\u2019t want to deal with \u201cpicking a side,\u201d although it sounds like you would have been just fine seeing him some other time.  Regardless, he\u2019s the one who made it weird by not being fully honest and properly preparing you or your parents, not you.", "INFO: Was the party at his place or theirs?", "NTA\n\nIt was your brother's party, he is the one who makes the calls on who can and can't be there.  He invited you, and later he asked you not to leave.  It's a tough situation, and it was a dick move on his part to tell you lie to you and your parents by saying that they wouldn't be there (and vice versa), but that is on him.  It's definitely super awkward, but your parents could have left if they wanted to, they decided to stay.\n\nWhat it seems like is going on here is that your brother was hoping that now that you are clean, maybe by getting all of you to come to the party, it could start mending the relationship between you and your parents, but that's not something he should have done without talking to all of you in advance and seeing if that was something everyone was OK with.", "NTA - your brother is an adult who gets to decide who he wants to be at his party. If he wants you there, that\u2019s his decision. If you\u2019re parents don\u2019t want to see you, *they* need to be the ones to leave.", "NTA. Your brother is the asshole.  I'm willing to bet good money that he \\*knew\\* your parents were coming, and deliberately hid it from you, hoping to get you together to try and reconcile your differences.  It's not up to your parents to tell you to go; they didn't invite you, your brother did.  If they were uncomfortable, then they should have gone instead.", "Nta. Your brother is for lying to you and your parents hoping to stage an ambush reunion. And your parents are AH for trying to dictate that you leave. You were invited by birthday boy. It was his party and unless it was in their home they dont get to dictate the guest list.", "It was your brother's party.  It is his decision to invite all of you.  NTA.", "NTA assuming the party was at your brother's house. Your brother was though, he should have told both you and your parents you'd be at the party. Was he expecting them to magically be okay?", "NTA it was brother\u2019s bday and he invited you. But I feel like he is stirring up trouble. He lied to you about the parents being there and now has sent you their texts about being upset. He is playing at some game and IDK that it is a healthy one for you as you proceed in recovery. Tread carefully and maybe discuss it with your therapist or support group.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother set all of you up with the idea he'd be the hero who brought the family back together. Your parents obviously aren't ready for such a reunion, and instead of addressing your brother (the host) about the issue or removing themselves from the situation, they picked the worst choice by confronting you.\n\nYour brother owes you all an apology. Keep working on your recovery and being the best version of yourself. You can't control the feelings of others or how long it may take them to work past things, but you can control yourself and continue to build a life you can look back on with pride.", "NTA, it sounds like your brother lied to all of you to get you all in the same place to celebrate his birthday, knowing that none of you would be 100% ok with that. I think brother is the AH for setting this up", "NTA. It's your brothers gathering and he controls the invite. Sorry to hear you had  rough time when you were younger. Time passes, sounds like you have matured and bettered yourself. Maybe it's time for  healing conversation with your parents.", "NTA, you were invited and even when things were awkward, your brother asked you to stay. Despite the history, your parents have to respect your brothers whishes. \n\nCongrats on turning your life around! That is something to be proud of!", "NTA\nI think your parents failed you and gave up on you too soon. You were only 15, that is soooo sad. I can think of so many alternatives to putting you out, sheesh even juvie would have been a better option. They should be overjoyed that you are clean and doing well, that's how a loving person should feel.", "NTA, you are building a good life, and you didn't know they would be there. You didn't do anything wrong by staying. Your brother messed up by inviting all of you. \n\nINFO: you said your brother told you that your parents weren't going to be there. This suggests that he knew that it was important that you not be together at this time. Might your brother have been trying to force the issue?\n\nEdit: you did not ruin anything. Your presence is not the cause of your parents' pain or discomfort; your past actions and their own incapacity to cope are responsible for that.", "NAH Although I hope your brother owned it and said he invited you because they weren\u2019t going to attend. While awkward, it is a healing process. But I will say this, don\u2019t let people punish you longer than you punish yourself. While you did wrong, what you do going forward is what matters. I wish you well OP.", "NTA Even if you were an adult when you started doing bad, that still doesn't define you right now. But the fact you were so young when this started. I can't help thinking you've been lucky you haven't been around your parents. It sounds like they didn't help you, when it was their legal & moral responsibility to. \n\nRegardless of that, no matter what you did or didn't do. We all mess up repeatedly & get many chances to try to move forward as better people. Your brother wanted you as HIS birthday. You were honoring this. Happy recovery! Good job for all your handwork.", "YTA and your brother is too, although mostly him in this case. He should not have set it up that you and your parents were there at the same time, you are aware of the grief you caused them and didn't leave when you found out what your brother set up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother, even though he meant well, definitely is and he is responsible for the awkwardness both you and your parents experienced at his party. Life isn't a Hallmark Channel movie, where everyone makes up and hugs. It takes time to heal wounds and trying to force that healing backfires every time. At the same time, your parents are okay.

Your brother is the one at fault here as your parents are right - he should have given you ALL a heads up about each other.\n\nTheir discomfort is their own problem.\n\nBoth of my siblings were addicts (both have passed) and I get feeling distrustful or hurt and as you made some relationship-damanging mistakes in pursuit of your addiction, but your addiction started young and definitely begs the question of your parents' role in all of this.\n\nYou were a kid for most of your addiction (aand your mistakes!), and your parents being in therapy isn't because of you but because of them. It seems like they blame you for your struggles entirely, which would feel justified if your addiction didn't start at such a young age.\n\nI hope you are able to get yourself into therapy, perhaps even as a family at some point.\n\nDon't let this impact your sobriety!

He needs to start by sitting down with everyone separately and finding out if they are even interested and willing to try, then, if they are, it needs to be a private meeting between all of you, not at a party with a bunch of people around.  If that meeting ever takes place, there are going to be a lot of emotions flying around, probably some crying and arguing... not the kind of thing to do at a birthday party.", "He's 100% the AH for tricking them into being around you, but I kind of feel like you could have left if you knew you were making things worse for them after everything you've done.

You can't just say \"I decided I'm a new person, so nothing I did to you counts anymore. Get over it\". OP robbed these people. He broke into thier home. He's also gotten clean before, and then turned around and started using a few months later. I would 100% not feel safe around someone who'd done those things to me. If he really cared about being a better person and was actually remorseful about what he'd done, wouldn't he take responsibility for how his actions affected his parents and not want to cause them any more turmoil? \n\nIt just seems incredibly selfish to not care at all about how the people HE hurt feel about being around him.", ".... they kicked him out.

That he was the bigger AH for putting them both in this situation.", "Oh yeah, I misread that part.", "So... that's your take ? If a teenager misbehave and \"don't want to be fixed\", the solution is to kick them out because you can't do anything ?\n\nThis is a terrible way to parent.

This was not just like buying OP a new pair of shoes. It was a life saving expense. He could have died from an overdose. It wasn't the kind of expense you ask yourself \"if you have the mean\". Also, free rehab center exists.\n\n>Forcing someone into rehab does nothing\n\nMaybe in some case, sure ? But you owe it to your kid to try.\n\nBottom line is : Kicking a minor child out of your house because rehab center near you are too full, and you don't want to be inconvenience with the drive there, and it's expensive, and you don't want to look for free one, and oh, well, this might not even work soooooo better just make him disapear so he is not an inconvenience anymore.... Yeah, this is an asshole move.\n\nEdit : My answer would have been different if OP was a fully grown adult at that time.

If your kid goes off the rails before they are of age it\u2019s your job to take care of them still, even if that looks a little different.

If it being a little uncomfortable and awkward was as bad as it got, then I feel like that is pretty hopeful. Because it certainly could have gone so much worse. \n\nHis brother has been able to see just how far he's come in his recovery and overcoming his addiction. He knew that his parents would never have willingly agreed to see OP.  He also knew that OP would never want to make them anymore upset, so he'd never do it on his own, either. Which doesn't leave much room for any sort of reconciliation. This was likely the best solution he could feasibly come up with, in order to try and bridge the massive chasm between them! You cannot fault the brother for wanting to bring his family back together. \n\nAny way you slice it, this is very likely going to be a positive in the long-term.

Do you have other siblings to compare to?", "Even the getting mixed up with a bad crowd scenario makes me think that there was enough of neglect there that the parents either didn't notice or didn't care. And I get that parents - especially if they have very taxing jobs with odd hours - might not always be as present for their child as they should be or even as they wished they were, but that still shouldn't be an excuse, because they still were the one who decided to have a child in the first place.", "Yeah, this. No healthy, happy 14 year old starts running with wrong crowds and becoming alcoholic coke addicts. There was something else happening, and while we really don\u2019t know the story, I\u2019m sure the parents play some role in why OP got into that bad a lifestyle that young. Like wtf causes a 14 year old to do this? That wasn\u2019t some teen angst rebellion bullshit, there was something that triggered this. Those parents suck and I know the brother was probably trying to \u201cfix\u201d the family, but that ship sailed long ago.", "I agree with what you're saying with regards to OP, my comment was solely for the person I responded to who seems to think they have an absolute right to redemption when it comes to people they have hurt.\n\nYou seem to have a lot of self awareness and empathy for the people in your life who were affected by your actions which is highly commendable.", "that\u2019s one of the main things that stuck with me after my first overdose, the nurse said \u201cwelcome back to a \u2018normal\u2019 society\u201d it\u2019s a very weird concept", "\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Don\u2019t ever fucking have children"]}
