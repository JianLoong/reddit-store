I still have to rinse off in clean water though to avoid being coated in a soapy film afterwards. It\u2019s bad for my sensitive skin.

Must be a cultural difference.", "Honestly it's more in general to reddit since it seems a lot of people seem to think baths are dirty and not good for cleaning which says a lot about how people bathe and even shower - the number of people I know who only scrub under the armpits and their bits is quite frankly horrifyingly disgusting.\n\nCompletely understand the sensitive skin thing. Yeah we've used a big jug for rinsing hair and self off after a bath since I was a lad, like you say gotta rinse off the soapy film otherwise you feel greasy by end of day as well as bad for your skin.", "Oh my god ew! No don\u2019t worry I actually clean myself haha. I don\u2019t think baths are dirty, I just need that extra little fresh water hit afterwards to rinse the soap off. I liken it to how I rinse my dishes after cleaning them with dish soap."]}
