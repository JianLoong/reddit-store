Expecting you to cancel the plans for 12 people simply because one of the smaller group (who had a separate meal planned) now cannot make that booking and expects you to switch the big booking to a bland menu restaurant because he cannot eat there reeks of entitlement.", "My partner is deathly allergic to peanuts, he cannot enter certain restaurants, for example Thai. He however hates when people make a fuss over him, he would far prefer everyone enjoy the occasional meal and he meets up with the group before or after. I think default practice should be to include people with severe allergies and go to places where everyone can eat. However this is a nice thing you are doing for your aunt, don't let them bully you out of your plans.\n\nNTA", "NTA: like you said, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about your aunt. What does she have to say about the situation? Since it\u2019s her celebration I\u2019d ask her opinion and follow her lead. She might not want the drama and be okay with moving the celebration (which would be annoying, but you could be the bigger person)", "NTA.\n\nThis was a dinner out specifically for your Aunt, so that she could get a taste of the \"old country\". That was the whole point of selecting the restaurant.\n\nYou had made separate plans for a dinner out with your brother and his mother, but they couldn't make it. You told them about the dinner intended for *someone else*, and they want you to change to a restaurant that fails to meet your original intention - serving food reminiscent of your Aunt's home country.\n\nNo. That dinner was specifically chosen for your aunt. Your brother & his mother don't get to dictate to you that you can't take your aunt to a specific restaurant. \n\nReschedule the dinner with your brother and his mom, but take your aunt to the restaurant you'd planned on taking her to.", "NTA - if you were going out with your friends to a place your bro couldn't and then he decides to tag along, it wouldn't be your problem.", "Am I missing something? You're supposed to NOT take your aunt to a restaurant reminiscent of the Old Country?\n\nHow old is the peanut allergy person? How do they go to school, or into the supermarket, or really to any public place since people can eat protein bars or anything with nuts... anywere?\n\nCan the allergic person not sit with everyone, or ask to bring their own meal due to safety concerns?  If they're that allergic that they can't even sit there, how do they get through life?", "INFO: Is the aunt also his aunt?", "NTA-it\u2019s not a celebration for him. You would be TA if you planned an incompatible restaurant to celebrate his birthday or something.", "NTA\n\nYou made separate plans. They bailed on the plans that would have accommodated the allergy.", "INFO: Is this also your brothers aunt? If so, as much as it sucks, you probably should\u2019ve gotten a place where he could join you and you could dine with your aunt at the other place privately.", "NTA. You made separate plans with each group, the bland peanut-free group and the old-country food which I assume is miles better. It's unlucky that they couldn't make the first one but I'm sure you'll see them again; when you have severe food restrictions you have to accept that sometimes people will go to restaurants without you, especially given that it's nice to make the aunt feel welcome.\n\nMaybe you could've handled it better but going to a Canadian chain would not fulfil your aunts needs here. People seem to have a problem with you 'inviting' them but I'm sure you just said that as a courtesy in case they thought they could make it work somehow. It sucks being excluded from a large family event, but you can't always go to the same restaurant and in this case there's a specific and valid reason for not doing so.", "NTA...Have you spoken to the restaurant and asked if a safe outside meal can be brought in, by either you or  them?", "NTA - You had planned something else that your brother bailed on.  You then presented an option, BUT did warn him in advance about possible allergy issues.  Does you mother generally believe your brother to be the \"golden child\"?  You chose a restaurant that wasn't suited to him BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOING TO BE THERE.", "NTA. It's a hard situation. I can understand the brother feeling a little hurt but it sounds like you did your best to do something special for him as well, and this meal is a gift for your aunt.  I am wondering if your half-brother is related to your aunt or not? If so, I can see feeling kinda left out, though I still don't think it's wrong. If he's not actually related, really no reason to complain.", "NAH \n\nYour reasoning and actions are not entirely wrong\u2026 but you have effectively excluded your brother from joining you. You know that he probably can\u2019t even just be sitting in that restaurant depending on severity of allergy. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that they are upset.\n\nYou should think about doing the chain restaurant thing with the whole family as an outing and go to the more exciting restaurant with your aunt in a much smaller group or just the two of you.", ".. \"hey, you can come and die if you want too?\" \n\n\nI'm a bit surprised what you expected your brother to do?", "YTA. Isn\u2019t your aunt his aunt too? Why would you have a dinner for a family member that not everyone could attend? You could always take your aunt to that restaurant one-on-one.", "Yeah, YTA. You could have taken your aunt alone out to eat with just the two of you. Basically, what you've done is discrimination towards someone with a life threatening disability. \n\nLet me put it into perspective for you: your whole family is invited to a restaurant that is up 3 flights of stairs. There is no elevator or ramp. You were in an accident and are paralyzed from the waist down and are now unable to climb stairs. You'd be happy sitting at home while we're out enjoying ourselves, yeah? We'll meet up with just you at a restaurant that has an elevator another day. Not the whole family, just me and your aunt. You'd understand and not sit there feeling sorry for yourself, right? It's nothing against you, it's just we can't be bothered always finding places that accommodate you. \n\nIf you tell me you'd be ok with that, you're lying. Anyone would feel depressed, unwanted, unloved. He cannot help his peanut allergy. He would literally die. \n\nYou're not a very nice person, so yes, YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So there was a soft invitation to the Aunt's pre-exisiting event - as a bonus dinner, not as a replacement for *his* dinner.  Who tf are they to try to redesign someone else's party for themselves? Keep that entitlement up and there will be a lot fewer dinners in their future! SMH. It's a Yes or No answer to 'Do you want to come to Auntie's event?'. That's it.
