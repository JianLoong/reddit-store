Get the best one you can possibly find, or if money may be an issue, try to make sure yours is better than his. Depending on where you work, you may even be able to get your boss or coworkers to help you by recommending someone they may know about, or your companies HR may be able to point you toward a good one. They may even kindly give you a day or two off to work on finding that lawyer since you're doing this to protect your kids. The faster you find that attorney and get the process started, the better. For the kids' sake, you need to keep your husband on the back foot and make HIM scramble to try and defend himself from the accusations instead of him getting the jump and throwing accusations at you that will make YOU scramble to defend yourself while trying to prove he's the problem. As to your comment about him only acting against (also called abusing) you while he's drunk, I'm going to amend your statement about not acting against the kids with \"YET\". For now the only abuse the kids have suffered is having to hear him scream (at you). Ask yourself how long before he starts to actively verbally abuse them, or even reach the level of physically abuse them, when he's drunk. You can sugarcoat what's happening (to an extent) to your kids, but don't do it anywhere else. Be plain and blunt about EVERYTHING you and the kids have gone though when talking to your lawyer, to the courts, and to your family. The kids, and you as well, need all the support you can get. When talking to your kids, make it so they can understand. It sounds like your eldest has a fair idea, so sugarcoating things may not be wise with her, but your youngest may need it explained in gentler terms. It might be beneficial to find them a therapist, even if all goes right for you in the matter (you could probably use one too). If you get them a therapist, he or she should be able to help you phrase everything appropriately to your kids.
