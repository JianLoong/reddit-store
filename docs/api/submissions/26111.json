You got parental permission. Sounds like there's some insecurity surfacing here.", "NTA. You asked the baby's father for permission and acted with good intentions to help. Cutting a baby's nails is a common and necessary task to prevent them from scratching themselves. Your actions were thoughtful and responsible.", "NTA. She\u2019s blowing it up for no reason.. By the title I was expecting you to say that you were babysitting alone and did it without asking, but that\u2019s not the case. If she has a problem with it then she should be taking up with the father who told you yes. (Which even then she shouldn\u2019t do though cause wth?

Sounds like mama is going through some insecurity. I can only assume most mothers would be happy to have someone in the family not only see a problem, want to fix it but makes sure to ask permission first, and then follow through with it.", "NTA because you got dad's permission to cut the nails.  You didn't just grab the baby and nail clippers and get to work.", "NTA and the mother is. Ppl need to chill the fuck OUT!!!! You were just trying to be nice and caring about the baby not hurting himself, unlike the mom who took you doing that as a major assault to her ego. \n\nThis is about baby mamas ego.

Are there any cultural traditions around that for the baby's mother?

This is something that they need to sort out between themselves, and the gf is being passive-aggressive by not speaking to you directly.", "NTA. You asked permission and only cut the nails because you say the baby was scratching at their face and their nails were long. You don\u2019t seem like you were trying to parent-shame the mom or show how great of a mom you were\u2014 seems like you were just genuinely trying to help and the mom has some stuff going on that surfaced with you doing something helpful (with consent!!)", "NTA. You made the present parental party aware of the concern and proposed action to address it before doing so. Many parents struggle, even avoid, cutting their newborn\u2019s nails for fear of cutting them and ask for help from loved ones or processionals. She should talk to your BIL about the boundaries she has for their children.", "NTA  you asked and the father gave permission", "NTA, dad is a parent too & you had his permission. Would the mother prefer he come back with scratches all over his face from his nails?? Im sure you would get blamed for that too. Also, maybe if she had taken care of his nails, you wouldn\u2019t have to! \nReminds of my very wealthy & well off (we\u2019re talking multi-millionaires) SIL dropping off my nieces in pajamas that smelled like piss, with dirt all over their faces, & un-brushed hair. My mom & immediately bathed them, washed their pajamas & brushed their hair without even asking her. I\u2019m not about to let my nieces suffer in silence to avoid bruising her ego so I completely understand.", "NTA. If she really knew how to be a parent, she should have cut them herself. Anyway, all you did was cut his nails, it's not like you put him on a plane to the other side of the planet without her knowledge.", "NTA she is over reacting.  Probably she is tired.", "Tbh no but next time just let her do it. Or at least make sure they are on the same page.", "NTA. She sounds like\u2026not a great person.", "NTA. You asked the babies father, and he approved. End of story.", "NTA.  You had the child\u2019s father\u2019s approval.  The child\u2019s mother complaining is because she knows it was a task she had neglected.  I cannot count the times I have wanted to wipe the snot of a kid\u2019s nose in public, but doing so would be inappropriate and deemed aggressive.  By bitching on social media, she outed herself as not paying attention to her child\u2019s hygiene needs.", "NTA The dad is as much of a parent as the mom. She seems like a difficult person.", "NTA - you asked and a parent approved. Doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal.", "NTA\n\nDidnt BIL tell momma he gave you permission to cut the nails???", "Ignore the post and the baby momma. Not your circus, not your monkeys. You asked and received permission from the baby\u2019s dad. The rest is his nonsense to deal with. NTA", "YTA. Keep your hands off someone else\u2019s baby!", "Or other relatives (from either side) who have been leaning on them for other things. Cutting the nails seems like such a silly thing to be upset over unless it's just the last straw.", "I\u2019m not sure. We have only met her a few times would be my guess, but BIL comes around pretty often. She refuses to come around even though she\u2019s been invited to multiple things, and always comes up with excuses with why she can\u2019t come. Nobody has said anything about her, and everyone has always welcomed her.", "Yes, the two times she has visited she never spoke a word. Her mother has passed and her father is an addict and she claims to want a family, but refuses to visit or even want to be there when we (the entire BIL\u2019s side of the family) ask to visit them. Not to mention her seven year old is very rude, he cusses, flips people off, etc. She condones this behavior, but nobody has said anything about it to her.", "*is she normally this fuckin weird* made me snort", "No it wasn\u2019t the baby\u2019s first nail trimming and no they are not religious what so ever. When MIL asked her about it all she mentioned was if I were to have cut him she would\u2019ve been pissed.", "No she has came around maybe three times. Her seven year old son is very disrespectful (cusses, flips people off, aggressive, etc.) but nobody has mentioned anything about it. BIL is the favorite child and any woman he has brought around the in laws have always welcomed with open arms.", "What is your problem? They are new parents with a newfound world of responsibility of caring for an infant. They\u2019re allowed to receive help and pointers.", "Seems like your brother is in hell", "Well this sounds like all kinds of \u201cyikes\u201d and your updates in the upcoming months/years will probably be interesting.", "My ex was kinda like this. Because he had trauma with his family he refused to meet mine. I got him to meet one of my sisters and her partner a couple of times and my brother, briefly, once. He thought he'd a good handle on his issues but it became clear over time that he didn't and this aversion was part of it. It was sad but it had to end and this was partly why. I'm not even super close to my family apart from that one sister, but if someone's serious in my life, they do need to be able to meet them.", "Dunno then. NTA. \n\nBut cultural tradition \u2260 religious. Sure there's overlap but they're not the same thing.", "Ok... Sounds like you disapprove of her son's behavior and everyone else's (lack of?) Reaction to it. \n\nCould be she's picking up on your disapproval even if \"nobody has mentioned anything\"? Cuz that's a weird ass reaction to a one time baby manicure. \n\nShe could just be out of line, but dollars to doughnuts there's other stuff that she feels judged/micro-aggressioned at about - either by you or your mother/any sisters/aunts - in regards to her baby. *He's* a new dad, she's not a new mom, and  there may be some unconscious biases/people forgetting and that gets extra prickly cuz now it feels like maybe they don't think the older kid counts and how dare they... \nThere's a lot of potential for accidental offense in this situation. I don't think you're ta, but you could pick up a lot of yardage here by talking it out with her, saying you think she's a very capable mom and you're just doing what a mom does with babies in her care - not because you think she can't or doesn't know, but because we are all on the same team here.\n\nSource: I'm from the judgey side of the family that is so condescending and critical of new moms who married their brothers/uncles/sons and I do have to go out of my way to assure them I'm not with those clucking hens, I am not being passive aggressive, I was just baby sitting and the baby needed a bath or whatever.", "The mom isn\u2019t a new parent though. She has a 7 year old.", "This is not recieving help and pointers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a deadbeat dad letting the next available women (or another dad notas much of a deadbeat) do his parenting for him.", "I'm so surprised this is so far down. This story reeks of missing info and a half sided story. Why did BIL take the baby over to SIL? has no one said \\*anything\\* or do they just not say it \\*too\\* her? a child that young doing those things is usually due to trauma as well. OP says the mother condones that behavior...but how? In my experience, addressing those behaviors, instead of ignoring them and addressing the trauma, makes it worse. so is she just supporting her son through the transition of a new half sibling, somehting with his dad, or his cousins bully him or something? so much information missing here.", "It\u2019s trimming the baby\u2019s finger nails. Go away worthless troll.", "A dad shopuld be capable of doing that himself. So: a deadbeat."]}
