She can take you to court and you should answer any summons, but she's going to lose. She's the one with the allergy. She needs to take precautions, including asking if what she's going to eat has pb in it. You're not a store. You don't have to label ingredients, especially if it's a casual get together and no one you know has an allergy. It'd be a different story if you knew one or two people had a nut allergy and didn't state beforehand, \"hey, btw, this has nuts, so don't eat it.\" \n\nShe's running for winning the Darwin award if she's going to go around to homemade things without asking what's inside if she has a life-threatening allergy. Even if it hadn't been obvious, she still needs to ask. I have a non-fatal pepper allergy. I get migraines. If I'm not sure if something has peppers in, I ask. Because I'm the one that suffers if I don't. Tell Janie that she can consider this a 2k lesson in learning how to ask what's in an unlabeled food item before she eats it, something she as an adult should already know.", "Tbh this post has me wondering how Janie made it this far in life with a severe peanut allergy if she's in the habit of blind taste testing random desserts at parties. NTA, at all.", "NTA. This is just so weird. \n\n1) Peanuts&peanut butter have a really strong distinct smell. \n2) Nobody seems to have been told that she had an allergy.\n3) She never asked you if there was any peanut in them.\n\nIs the ER bill definitely real? Because honestly it sounds like a scam. (Also if she\u2019s that oblivious to eating peanut butter she should probably invest in some epipens, but that\u2019s beside the point.) \n\nThe one thing I would definitely take the trouble to do is draft an accurate statement of what happened and keep it to copy paste in response to any flying monkeys. Don\u2019t give her money, don\u2019t apologize, don\u2019t feel bad and DON\u2019T ever let her eat any of your food again.

No, because you as a person are responsible in either reading the menu or telling staff.", "NTA - if you were not questioned as to the presence of an allergen, how would you have known someone was allergic.  \n\nPersonally, if I was allergic to peanuts I would have questioned everything before taking a bite.\n\nSounds like Janie took a risk by eating the tarts and now wants you to pay for her actions.", "NTA for 3 reasons :\n\n1. If your friend Rob was aware Janie had allergies and obviously known that you would brought dessert, he **should** have mentionned Janie's allergies\n2.

She's not a child who needs protection from her own stupidity.", "NTA - people with severe nut allergies should double check any foods but particularly sweets.", "You're NTA. Even a four year old with a severe food allergy knows to ask whether something contains the allergen before eating it. You're not responsible for her lack of common sense.", "NTA Most people with severe allergies know to ask if any foods contain items they may be allergic to, especially people with nut allergies. If that\u2019s the case, why didn\u2019t she sue the host for not making sure all food was labeled. If that\u2019s the case none of the food was labeled so what if someone with another allergy got sick from another food? Let her take you to court. She can\u2019t afford her bill so she is looking for a scapegoat.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA because she\u2019s an adult and not a child. The responsibility falls on her first to make sure the food is safe to eat or communicate there cannot be nut products at the party. If you had ignored that or she asked for allergens to be labeled and you didn\u2019t, then the verdict would be different", "NTA\n\nI have a food allergy and carry an epipen.\n\nNo way would I try anything without checking. An anaphylactic reaction is horrendous, plus the day in hospital in case the reaction starts up again (quite common apparently).

Something isn't quite on the up and up here.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.  And this is coming from someone with a nut allergy.  Janie should definitely ask if there is any question about any nuts at all.  If she wants you to pay her bills, she'll need to take you to court.", "NTA. She knew that she had an allergy. She is responsible for ensuring that she doesn't eat foods with nuts. Why didn't they warn people not to bring anything containing nuts? My understanding is that nut allergies are bad enough that even having something in the house could trigger it, because the peanut oil can transfer from a person's hands", "NTA\n\nPB has a distinct smell. She ate it on her own, no one forced it into her mouth.\n\nDo not pay.", "NTA - If you have a severe food allergy and people are bringing home made food, it is the responsibility of the person with allergies to check on ingredients.

To know, to know to ask if she doesn't know, to keep safe distance etc. The general public shouldn't have to babysit a grown-ass woman.", "Just a FYI, for your son. If he travels to the UK, we don't use the term acetaminophen, we call the generic substance paracetamol.", "People with heart problems are still given Epi in a severe allergic reaction, they\u2019re just monitored closely and advised to call 911 immediately upon using it. There are no absolute contraindications to epi, including heart issues. Benefits vs risk with those with sensitivity.", "Either way, this woman is, I'm guessing, in her 20s.  She should know better", "Peanut oil, maybe?", "We tell patients that, but if mild symptoms, not always necessary. Although I\u2019ll admit the standard is \u2018if you use it, go.\u2019 Regardless, OP remains NTA.", "I ment what if she made the whole thing up? I can photoshop an ER bill too.", "That's me with black pepper. I hate the taste and it only burns my mouth. so I generally shy away from antyhing with pepper as the main ingredient.", "Haha, thank you for the laugh this morning!", "True, she's well on her way.", "I babysat a 4 year old who couldn't read the word \"kiwi\", but knew what they looked like and asked for a different juice box at a birthday party. 4. \n\n\nThe girlfriend is a damn idiot.", "It\u2019s most likely that one was used in the ER. It\u2019s like step one of high allergen treatment", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It\u2019s paracetamol in Australia too", "Yeah he\u2019s heard of that too. He wasn\u2019t always allergic, he just one day a few years ago broke out in hives, we didn\u2019t know why and gave him Benadryl. When it happened a few months later we realized he took Tylenol both those times. Then a few months after that he had a cold when my mom was babysitting and that was the 3rd reaction, but first anaphylactic reaction. \n\nMy allergy to ibuprofen is different, it causes ulcers if I take even a little. But that\u2019s so painful that I\u2019m pretty vigilant.", "I think it's called paracetamol in most -if not all- Europenan countries", "That would be my guess too", "It would take a considerable amount of skill to completely make an ER from scratch with photoshop. Particularly in such a short time. And I presume Rob took her to the ER, so likely she did actually go to the ER. \n\nNow, altering the prices on a bill you did receive to change the amount? Far more do-able. But, it would be really hard to make a bill completely from scratch so I think that is highly unlikely."]}
