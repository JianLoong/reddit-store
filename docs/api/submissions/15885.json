Both are great kids, love them and would do anything for them.

She had to be airlifted to the hospital. They weren\u2019t sure if she was going to make it so family members were being called in to say goodbye and support the rest of the family. This happened across the state we live in. Sis texted me around 10:40ish that night, asking if I was awake then called to explain the situation. She then asked if I would babysit the kids over Easter weekend while they travelled across state to be with BIL\u2019s family.\n\nI told her no, I couldn\u2019t. I work in a steel manufacturing plant (she knows this) on a rotary shift and after Easter, on Monday; I would be starting the overnight shifts. I told her that I was going to sleep during the day on Saturday and Sunday to get accustomed to being on third shift. When she asked if my wife would be willing, I again told her no; since she\u2019s going to be doing Easter stuff with her side of the family. When she asked why I couldn\u2019t just sleep in on Sunday or why couldn\u2019t my wife take the kids with her to the Easter stuff; I snapped back at her that I gave her three reasons why. That one, I wanted the weekend to adjust my shift in sleeping schedules and couldn\u2019t do that in one day. Two, my wife wanted to spend Easter with her side of the family. And finally, that no is a complete sentence and that\u2019s final. \n\nShe got pissed. Said we\u2019ll talk later and hung up. They took the kids and on the way, sis texted me that I\u2019m an asshole for not taking their tragedy to heart. For not helping them in their time of need. That \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have killed me or my wife to miss a day of sleep or take the kids with her. And BIL is pissed at us.

Perhaps the children would have enjoyed the Easter activities with your wife, or perhaps your wife\u2019s family would have enjoyed to create a special Easter for the children.

No, you won't do that. \n\nIf you're living in an even half-way humane country, you had the option to call your workplace and inform them of a family emergency to give you an extra day to sleep after the kids have gone back home, or taken a sick day. Failing that, your wife could have brought them with her. They're 8 and 9, not toddlers or infants. Their presence wouldn't have prevented her from spending Easter with her family.

You wouldn't be excused for calling out for an emergency for a non-relation.  It boils down to can you take the punishment for calling in or would it jeopardize your employment status.

Close friends?\nSure you don't live far, but what if you did, how would they manage the kids?\nMy mom never had anyone to leave me or my sister with, so we would just go with her everywhere \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n3) The kids seem to be old enough to behave, couldn't you still rearrange your schedule with them there? Like, lose 2h of that extra sleep, but still get the rest, and just have the kids entertained with something. \nMy stepfather is a security, so he does every schedule there is, during the weekends he does 12h shifts. He doesn't rearrange his sleep like you do. During the week when he does night shift, he sleeps after lunch until dinner. During the weekend he sleeps after breakfast until mid afternoon. Sometimes it's after lunch until mid afternoon. And sure, it's not the ideal. But if you were to do it only 1x or 2x you would be fine. If a 61yo man can do it and be okay. Unless you have a specific condition you failed to mention.\n\n4) I know your wife was already asleep, but this was an emergency, why not wake her and ask? You could've awakened her to ask her about it. If it was just normal babysitting no emergency involved, sure, let the woman sleep. But it was urgent, it's an exception.\n\n5) How is the sister?
