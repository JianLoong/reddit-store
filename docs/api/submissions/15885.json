She had to be airlifted to the hospital. They weren\u2019t sure if she was going to make it so family members were being called in to say goodbye and support the rest of the family. This happened across the state we live in. Sis texted me around 10:40ish that night, asking if I was awake then called to explain the situation. She then asked if I would babysit the kids over Easter weekend while they travelled across state to be with BIL\u2019s family.\n\nI told her no, I couldn\u2019t. I work in a steel manufacturing plant (she knows this) on a rotary shift and after Easter, on Monday; I would be starting the overnight shifts. I told her that I was going to sleep during the day on Saturday and Sunday to get accustomed to being on third shift. When she asked if my wife would be willing, I again told her no; since she\u2019s going to be doing Easter stuff with her side of the family. When she asked why I couldn\u2019t just sleep in on Sunday or why couldn\u2019t my wife take the kids with her to the Easter stuff; I snapped back at her that I gave her three reasons why. That one, I wanted the weekend to adjust my shift in sleeping schedules and couldn\u2019t do that in one day. Two, my wife wanted to spend Easter with her side of the family. And finally, that no is a complete sentence and that\u2019s final. \n\nShe got pissed. Said we\u2019ll talk later and hung up.

If that wouldn't have been possible, would it really have been so much of a hinderance for your wife to take them with her to partake in Easter activities?\n\nI can't imagine my siblings behaving like this if I my husband's family had some kind of emergency like this.

For an extreme emergency like that for a close family member I would have tried to alter my work schedule or have my wife change her plans or take the children with her.  Perhaps the children would have enjoyed the Easter activities with your wife, or perhaps your wife\u2019s family would have enjoyed to create a special Easter for the children.  In addition - for the children to potentially be losing an aunt would be traumatic for them - so for them to be able to be with you/family someone they know rather than passed off to other friends would have been a comfort for all involved.", "YTA.\n\n\n>And Finally, that no is a complete sentence, and that\u2019s final. \n\nyou're right.

No, you won't do that. \n\nIf you're living in an even half-way humane country, you had the option to call your workplace and inform them of a family emergency to give you an extra day to sleep after the kids have gone back home, or taken a sick day. Failing that, your wife could have brought them with her. They're 8 and 9, not toddlers or infants. Their presence wouldn't have prevented her from spending Easter with her family.

You wouldn't be excused for calling out for an emergency for a non-relation.  It boils down to can you take the punishment for calling in or would it jeopardize your employment status.
