We live in a small, two bedroom house with the second bedroom converted into a game room / \u201coffice\u201d for us. My sister (32F) and BIL (35M) have two kids, nephew (8M) and niece (9F). Both are great kids, love them and would do anything for them. We\u2019ve babysat for my sis and BIL before and had no issues until recently.\n\nOn April 7th, Good Friday; BIL got a call that his sister (28F) was in a near fatal car accident along with two of her friends. She had to be airlifted to the hospital. They weren\u2019t sure if she was going to make it so family members were being called in to say goodbye and support the rest of the family. This happened across the state we live in. Sis texted me around 10:40ish that night, asking if I was awake then called to explain the situation. She then asked if I would babysit the kids over Easter weekend while they travelled across state to be with BIL\u2019s family.\n\nI told her no, I couldn\u2019t. I work in a steel manufacturing plant (she knows this) on a rotary shift and after Easter, on Monday; I would be starting the overnight shifts. I told her that I was going to sleep during the day on Saturday and Sunday to get accustomed to being on third shift. When she asked if my wife would be willing, I again told her no; since she\u2019s going to be doing Easter stuff with her side of the family. When she asked why I couldn\u2019t just sleep in on Sunday or why couldn\u2019t my wife take the kids with her to the Easter stuff; I snapped back at her that I gave her three reasons why. That one, I wanted the weekend to adjust my shift in sleeping schedules and couldn\u2019t do that in one day. Two, my wife wanted to spend Easter with her side of the family. And finally, that no is a complete sentence and that\u2019s final. \n\nShe got pissed. Said we\u2019ll talk later and hung up. They took the kids and on the way, sis texted me that I\u2019m an asshole for not taking their tragedy to heart. For not helping them in their time of need. That \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have killed me or my wife to miss a day of sleep or take the kids with her. And BIL is pissed at us.

Perhaps the children would have enjoyed the Easter activities with your wife, or perhaps your wife\u2019s family would have enjoyed to create a special Easter for the children.

Failing that, your wife could have brought them with her. They're 8 and 9, not toddlers or infants. Their presence wouldn't have prevented her from spending Easter with her family.

You wouldn't be excused for calling out for an emergency for a non-relation.  It boils down to can you take the punishment for calling in or would it jeopardize your employment status.

Close friends?\nSure you don't live far, but what if you did, how would they manage the kids?\nMy mom never had anyone to leave me or my sister with, so we would just go with her everywhere \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n3) The kids seem to be old enough to behave, couldn't you still rearrange your schedule with them there? Like, lose 2h of that extra sleep, but still get the rest, and just have the kids entertained with something. \nMy stepfather is a security, so he does every schedule there is, during the weekends he does 12h shifts. He doesn't rearrange his sleep like you do. During the week when he does night shift, he sleeps after lunch until dinner. During the weekend he sleeps after breakfast until mid afternoon. Sometimes it's after lunch until mid afternoon. And sure, it's not the ideal. But if you were to do it only 1x or 2x you would be fine. If a 61yo man can do it and be okay. Unless you have a specific condition you failed to mention.\n\n4) I know your wife was already asleep, but this was an emergency, why not wake her and ask? You could've awakened her to ask her about it. If it was just normal babysitting no emergency involved, sure, let the woman sleep. But it was urgent, it's an exception.\n\n5) How is the sister?

I get that sleep is a big deal, but I'm also the type of person who's traveled to another state to help a friend move after not sleeping for several days (I didn't drive).", "I really want to know how she reacted when she learned this had all gone down without her input. I wonder if BIL and family had already left or did she still have time to say, Hey, I\u2019ll help! Or is she also an AH.", "Based on this small sample i\u2019d say she doesnt even know the situation. The post never says he told his wife anything. Hopefully we get an update that his wife is also pissed at him", "Yes, of course they are. Statistically 83% of the accidents take place during day shift - which would appear to indicate that it\u2019s more unsafe to work days than nights. \n\nI\u2019m confused - are you genuinely shocked that people with children a) work in a factory setting and/or b) have children.", "Honestly I would be pissed if my husband didn\u2019t wake me up prior to saying no on my behalf in the same circumstances. There\u2019s no world where my family would be upset that we brought 2 extra kids to the Easter event if there was a legit emergency.", "Discussion about death yes, going to the ICU, no. A lot of hospitals wouldn\u2019t even let kids that young into the ICU.", "There\u2019s a difference between discussions of death and seeing a trauma patient in the ICU. That can be really scarring for kids, and completely unnecessary if they weren\u2019t close to the aunt. Also, a lot of ICUs don\u2019t allow visitors under 16 or 18, which means one of their parents will probably be sitting in the hospital lobby or waiting room with them for hours.", "Right. It\u2019s one thing to discuss death with an 8 and 9 year old. It\u2019s another to take them to the ICU to see their severely injured aunt. Seeing the state of their aunt could potentially bring upon unnecessary trauma for young kids.", "Um, what if the sister was burned or severely disfigured and bleeding? Kids do NOT need to see that!! This was not a funeral, it was a hospital visit.", "Most hospitals do not allow anyone under fourteen-sixteen in to icu units. They won't even let them in the hospital. My mom just had surgery and we had to have someone with my toddler at an airbnb, so we could visit at all.", "She has to know his sister is no longer on speaking terms with him. But this guy probably wouldn't admit it if she was upset.", ">Earplugs work wonders to lesson noise. White noise apps on phone to cover up the sounds that do get through. \n\nYou also need to get accustomed to earplugs and white noise. At least I do.", "OFC they have kids, but they keep them quiet during shift changeover sleep. Surprised YOU don't know that.", "I would have gone out of my way to make the day as fun as possible for them. I\u2019d make sure they had everything the other kids celebrating at my family\u2019s Easter celebrations had (basket, treats, presents, whatever!). I\u2019d make sure they had new outfits, and swim stuff (we have nice swim weather for Easter). They could have made it one of the most important days of the kids lives reminding them how much they are loved and how much they can rely on OP and his wife. Instead they got a life changing dose of trauma and learned OP and his wife don\u2019t care about them. YTA, OP.", "Exactly this if I needed to bring my niece and nephew from my husbands side with me while watching them to my families function they would be welcomed with open arms.", "Same here, my family would set two extra plates, probably run out to buy two baskets and some candy as well. And if that wasn't possible I'd cancel to look after the kids and everyone would understand.", "As a 90s kid my parents took me everywhere. This situation id be in lobby with one parent and the other go up. I\u2019m not saying take the kids into the icu unit. My whole childhood was sitting quiet at funerals, nursing homes with older parents. But 8 and 9 are old enough to understand needing to wait around and be quiet", "People who regularly work night shifts probably already use things like this cause you cannot control the outside world during the day", "So why couldn\u2019t a 9 year old and an 8 year old be kept \u201cquiet\u201d during shift changeover sleep. FWIW when my operatives start nights on a Monday night, they don\u2019t start sleeping during the day over the weekend - they adjust their pattern on Sunday night/Monday morning."]}
