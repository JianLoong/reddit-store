Maya and I have been friends for nine years, after meeting at university. \n\nMaya went through a lot of mental health issues in her early-mid 20s which impacted her career prospects, but a couple of years ago she found an outlet in writing, and now writes and publishes her stories online. They are of the \u201cspicy romance\u201d variety. I\u2019ve never read any of them because they\u2019re just not my thing but I know she has a lot of regular readers. \n\nRecently, Maya shared that she had been contacted by a small publishing company which publishes ebooks who were interested in publishing one of the stories she had been sharing online. I was ecstatic for her, as it is a move towards making writing a profession, which is what she really wants. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, a mutual friend of ours \u201cAmy\u201d, contacted me and asked if I had read any of Maya\u2019s current story as she had looked it up online and she thought it had some eerie similarities to my life. I looked it up and read a big chunk of it, and it was more than just similarities, it was basically a melodramatic reimagining of my life, specifically about my relationship with my fianc\u00e9, and my complicated relationship with my father. Idk how relevant this is but she also altered their characters and certain situations to make the \u201cplot\u201d pretty toxic. \n\nI was devastated and disgusted to say the least. I met up with Maya and asked how she could do this to me. Her explanation was that she was so inspired by my life and the things I\u2019d told her that the ideas just came to her. I kept saying they weren\u2019t her ideas, they were sensationalised details of my real life, she didn\u2019t have a single original thought in the whole story. Maya apologised profusely for hurting me and that she was embarrassed by how much she had taken from life but she really loved writing the book. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable having my private life aired like that. Maya said nothing in the book was identifiable as me so it wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d done anything illegal, and I said, well we\u2019ll see about that.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted lawyers and they\u2019ve said suing her would be largely pointless in terms of stopping the book being published, but starting legal proceedings might scare a small publishing company enough to drop her as an author. I am seriously considering doing this. Worst case, I can\u2019t do anything to stop the book going ahead but I\u2019ve caused her an iota of the stress and hurt she\u2019s caused me. Best case, this creepy project never sees the light of day.\n\nA couple of my friends are saying I shouldn\u2019t sue her, because at the end of the day this is her work and an opportunity for her to make a career for herself and take her of her child, after all she\u2019s been through. I know this could ruin things for her and I might be acting out of anger but I really think it\u2019s justified after she betrayed my trust like this. WIBTA to go ahead with suing?\n\nEdit/update: \n\nFor everyone talking about the Streisand effect - I am not in the US. Court/legal records here are not something you can Google or access easily. \n\nThat being said, I realise Maya could publicise a lawsuit herself to get publicity, and that ultimately I am more concerned about anonymity and it\u2019s not worth the risk. \n\nI will not be proceeding with the lawsuit. Some people suggested reaching out to the publisher privately, and I\u2019m going to look into that. But either way I won\u2019t drag it out into a court process.

Also make it clear you will tell any shared friends that she will steal *their* lives to write her stories, and profit off them without ever giving them a dime. \n\nThe lawyers are half right, suing her would be pointless, I think they know a pointless lawsuit won't stop a publisher though, the lawyers just want a paycheck.", "YWBTA, but not for the reason you think. You seem so revenge-focused that you are not thinking about additional long-term damage that you may recklessly cause to yourself.\n\nThe lawyers are correct that you don't really have a case, but the threat of legal action could dissuade a small publisher from going forward. This is, however, a double-edged sword since the author and publisher can use legal action as free publicity. Also, keep in mind that filing a lawsuit is a matter of public record. A lawsuit can forever attach this book to you since Googling you will probably result in finding out that there is a trashy novel that you say is based on your life story. In all likelihood, this book won't be a hit and will pretty much just die on the vine and the most it will become will be a great conversation piece when you're older and talking about the strangest things that ever happened in your life.", "Could you contact the publishing company before taking legal action and explain the situation to them? They may hopefully suggest that she changes enough of the details so that the book no longer reflects your life.", "Streisand Effect gonna getcha. YWBTA", "YTA\n\nI wouldn't sue over this. Unless she used your name, the fact that she used your life as inspiration for fictionalized stories is fine, and you've been told you don't have a case. I understand why you don't like it. What you are considering is called a bad faith claim, where you sue in an attempt to harass, punish, or hurt someone. Just let it go.", "NTA\n\nI really don't get the bumhole votes here. \n\nIt's not her story to tell. Your other friend clear saw that the book was about you, so it's not like Maya has hidn't it that well. Chances are that others will too. \n\nWhat a major AH to expose a friend. Expose their lifestory, vulnerabilities and secrets. She knew what she was doing by not telling you in the first place.\n\nI don't know if it's the best idea to sue her, it will just attach the book more to your name and can be used as a PR.", "YWBTA for reasons everyone has laid out and it would likely backfire. I think the best way forward is to cut this friend off completely, zero details about your life. That way she won\u2019t be able to write more about you.", "NTA but can see how some think you can be. You shouldn\u2019t sue, but your friend shouldn\u2019t publish this book either. All those saying oh artist take from life don\u2019t understand that this is just straight up violating. Just imagine your personal life being broadcasted to the world and having it skewed for drama. Being that one friend already brought it up its almost guaranteed that the rest of your close friends and even family will read this book and they will know exactly who it\u2019s about. It would be one thing if it was one life event that she used or even a few, but the fact that it\u2019s only changing your name and is written to stir up drama to \u201cfictionalize\u201d is not enough. You might not have a case, but this friend is messed up for writing this book and thinking it\u2019s ok for her to get it published.", "No judgment from me. Just wanted to say that I think it'd be a mistake to sue. No one outside a small group of people who know both of you is going to connect you to the book. If you make a big deal out of it, you will be publicly connecting yourself to the book. Sounds like the opposite of what you want.", "YTA. She should have been more upfront, but you\u2019re literally admitting that she didn\u2019t identify you and changed the story away from real life. Lots of writers write things based on real life and change bits. You have every right to be annoyed about it, but spending money on lawyers for something you\u2019re not going to win, just to cause some hurt on someone isn\u2019t worth it.\nHow many people are going to read this? Probably very few? How many people are going to know it\u2019s about you? Probably none, or some very close friends", "The best way to let the entire world know that the book is about you is to sue her. Then everybody will believe the story is 100% true as told. in the unlikely event that the book takes off, through the magic of Google, you will be (in)famous.\n\nIf that\u2019s what you want, then you should sue her.", "I\u2019d ask for royalties - not sue.", "Not judging on the suing, but you should let Maya know that it is easy enough to identify that you heard about it from someone else. \n\nYou didn't read her book and come to that conclusion on your own. A 3rd party read it and knew it was about you. Maybe if she realizes you CAN and actually have been identified, she may back off.", "YTA. It\u2019s not an \u201cunauthorized biography,\u201d it\u2019s not even fan fiction (if ever there was *maybe* a legitimate legal gripe). The Twilight author sure as heck couldn\u2019t sue the 50 Shades writer for her \u201cerotic reimagining,\u201d and Harry Styles hasn\u2019t done anything about the After series. Be annoyed, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s really all you have.", "She would be profiting off your life. Taken from your own words to her about it. That\u2019s incredibly wrong. And worse, sensationalizing the bad parts of your life. Using your fiance as inspiration also and making him more toxic?! Ugh. \n\nAnother friend contacting you after reading her work & recognizing it was modeled on you shows other people would too. Also shows the writer went way too deeply into your personal life. It\u2019s creepy and invasive. \n\nHer making a profit off your life is despicable. Definitely sue. Your other friends are okay with your life being hijacked & your fiance being portrayed badly to profit her, but I doubt they\u2019d feel that way if it was theirs!\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I think it could backfire pretty easily, your name would be attached to the story and become public forever. Then again she's not a well known author so it could be a small news blip not many care about.", "NTA. \n\nAbsolutely persue legal action if for no other reason than to stop her doing this to everyone who confides in her.", "The fact that someone contacted you because they recognized your story means that she didn\u2019t change enough. \n\nI highly doubt you can sue her for that but I definitely wouldn\u2019t stay friends with her.", "ESH - Maya sucks for so many obvious reasons. Your friends suck for thinking what she did was remotely okay. You suck for trying to go nuclear and sue instantly- that's why people are thinking you're from the US lol. Best to remove her entirely from your life- or maybe you should take up writing and become suddenly inspired by Mayas life.... So inspired you have to write a book.", "YTA - the embodiments and exaggeration that you talk about are writing. Writers are regularly inspired by the people around them. Ruining her career would be a huge AH move.", "Write a dramatized version of her life and post it all over and she how she feels about your side of the situation then. She might suddenly develop some empathy if you paint her/her loved ones in a terrible light, or she\u2019ll get really butthurt and throw a fit. Either way she gets a taste of her own medicine and you don\u2019t Streisand effect yourself in the process", "YTA. You don't have a case, but drop her as a friend. You'll be an asshole to yourself and the legal system for pursuing this.", "YWBTA\n\nShould she have been more upfront and spoken to you? yes\n\nShould you sue her? No\n\nShe didn\u2019t write a book about you, it\u2019s not a biography, she was inspired by the lives of those around her.\n\nWhat will you gain by doing so, by suing her? Some money? Maybe. Is it worth it?", "YWBTA. She may have had inspiration from your life, but come on now. A complicated relationship with your fianc\u00e9 and father? These are not unique to you lol. And you admit it\u2019s altered\u2026so like..fiction. JFC Your life isn\u2019t that special.", "NTA and this person isn't your friend. Proceed with a lawsuit and hopefully she gets dropped by the publisher and scares off any future ones", "Have you heard the saying that there is no such thing as an original story? Writers can - and will - draw inspiration from everything that happens around them. So do artists. And musicians. Any artistic expression is a reinterpretation of something or the other through the artist's perspective. You're allowed to be angry and have feelings about this, but your friend did *not* write a book about you. She took a real life event that she had knowledge of, put an exaggerated spin on it and created a fictional plot around fictional characters. You're too close to this. Chances are, if she had done this with someone else, you might feel differently. YTA", "YWBTA\n\nHow did she betray your trust exactly? She drew on parts of your life, yes but literally changed the names and intensified the plot.\n\nAlso, why throw money away to scare her? That is so spiteful and unnecessary. \n\nSheesh you're 29. Grow up and deal with it instead of getting petty revenge.", "At the very least your owed some of the money", "She did what authors do - create characters and storylines from the people and places around them, as well as their own life. Your friends may know it was you because they know specifics about your life, but unless she has written an actual biography of your life without giving you credit, she hasn\u2019t done anything illegal. By enhancing the story and characters and removing identifiable information, she was creating a work of fiction and you were just her muse.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it was awesome of her or that you shouldn\u2019t be offended or weirded out\u2026 but, take a step back and think about whether you want to ruin your friend\u2019s dreams over this. I don\u2019t have a judgment here because it is so very complex. You\u2019d think lawyers could have a compromise in mind like you receiving a portion of the sales price for it being somewhat about you.", "YTA.  You want to hurt her, that\u2019s pathetic and it makes me think that the book isn\u2019t as embellished as you want us to believe.  That\u2019s beyond toxic.  Beyond that, you\u2019ve been told you don\u2019t have a case and want to scare the publisher into ruining her career.  Double toxic.", "NAH. You're both in the wrong basically. I would come to some sort of agreement with her that she use different names, places, etc. to help with keeping some anonymity. However, art is usually derived from real life. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. And if this is truly her passion, who are you to squat and take a big dump on it because your life story is entertaining?", "Nta,\n\nShe should at least offer to give you 50% of all takings for providing the story!", "INFO: Are you one hundred percent confident it\u2019s about you?", "YWBTA, mostly because you seem to be motivated by revenge based on\u2026something. What difference does it make if your friend has no original thoughts? Also\u2026Streisand effect is real", "I think suing her just to destroy her career would be an AH move. Though I do understand your feelings of hurt and betrayal.\nPlease try to talk to her again. Explain to her that she really should have told you about it and should have shown you some of her stories before publishing them. If one of your friends can identify you in her writing, who else will do? Coworkers, former teachers,... your father? Taking this any further could actually affect your life and cause trouble! \nYou could go through some of her stories and underline the parts that are too close to your life.

Maybe even review it with her and change details so it's not all about your life! And put up an agreement about it and how much personal life of yours is in it.", "NTA, although it may get you nowhere and lead to more issues for yourself.\n\nHonestly, I would just completely remove Maya from your life.

Memoirs of a Geisha is an example of this. It was settled out of court so I don't know the result. But it's really not fine to take someone's entire life story and publish it as fiction of your own creation.", "She didn't use for inspiration tho, she copied OP's life and wrote it in a more dramatic way", "i think this could be fought in court.

The problem is that right now OP has anonymity outside of her friend group, if OP sues, there is going to be a distinct publicity available record of this incident and OP will be forever connecting the dots of the fact this is their life for anyone who googles their name. Let alone the fact that the publisher won\u2019t care and Maya will probably end up making more money because people will want to see what the controversy is all about. Sure, Maya absolutely is an asshole here, but OP needs to REALLY think about what they potentially have to gain or lose by suing. The best course of action in my opinion would be to just let this go and not publicly connect themselves to it, tell all of their mutual friends with Maya what happened and how bullshit the story is and then completely cut Maya out of their life. All of Maya and OP\u2019s mutual friends will know what happened and how Maya can\u2019t be trusted so telling them that she contorted and dramatized the smallest detail of OPs life would also provide air cover for OP about her actual life and situation because they can just Deny everything and say it was completely taken out of context.\n\nOP WNBTA to sue if they want to, but probably has a lot more to lose by suing in a petty act of revenge than just removing Maya from their life.", "Using someone else\u2019s story without consent and dramatizing it for profit is an AH move.", "I don\u2019t want money.

To go after her friends  hard work in a fit of revenge because \u201cher life was the inspiration\u201d \nI\u2019m pretty confident it\u2019s a common trope and many people live it. \nOP id unaffected. It\u2019s a dramatic story\u2026", "How has he responded? He's the one that's being made to look \"predatory\".\n\nAnother person pointed out that she may see him as actually predatory and weirdo. If you try keep your feelings for him out of it - which is obviously extremely hard - do you think that may be the case at all?", "How is it plagiarizing when they've altered the story? I also did not vote OP as an AH. And I've also clearly stated Maya should've spoken to OP beforehand. Clearly, which is disappointing for a writer, your reading skills are subpar.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Duck Sauce, is that you?", "Well that was aggressive. TIL", "Thank you! Streisand Effect is real", "'Zactly.", "How does this affect them? There is nothing tying them to this book. It is not a perfect retelling of OPs life.", "He\u2019s creeped out by it. He\u2019s not really a litigious person, but he\u2019s not the type to let it slide either. He\u2019s not *angry* about her writing that about him because she\u2019s not his friend so he doesn\u2019t care about her opinion but he\u2019s pissed off on my behalf because of the betrayal of trust. He just thinks she\u2019s trash and that she shouldn\u2019t get away with it. \n\nShe might think he\u2019s a creep. Which is fine if that\u2019s her opinion, that\u2019s obviously not how I feel. But it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s been in our home, he\u2019s paid for her to come on vacations with me, paid for dinners, etc., and I think it\u2019s f**ked up to take things from someone if you consider them toxic and creepy. \n\nIf you heard the backstory of our relationship with no context without knowing us as people then yes you could twist it into something weird, which she has done. But I don\u2019t think anyone who knows us could In good conscience think he did anything pred*tory", "You didn't vote OP as the asshole but you're still defending the author friend's \"art\" and saying it's overstepping to take further action - sometimes when you read/write you look for subtext and unreliable narrators instead of taking it at face value. \n\nIt's plagiarizing because she took the bulk of the story for her work without permission or credit and claimed it as her own for profit, and didn't come clean until she was caught. It would be less egregious if bits of OP served as an inspiration for a minor character, or to have taken some inspiration from specific parts she found interesting then changed it beyond recognition, but she copied enough so blatantly that not only did OP recognize her husband as the /main/ character, and the bulk of their story as the main plot - but friends of her recognized it too.Most people are willing to give friends the benefit of the doubt, so if it was so bad that a third party could immediately call it out as belonging to someone else *and* felt it was bad enough to bring it up to said person, I suspect it was pretty damn copy/pasted. \n\nThe friend should take the L and not publish this work. Which I get sucks, but it's a good life lesson to learn early in her career before it gets her into deeper trouble.", "Writing about your friend\u2019s private details as a coping mechanism is extremely weird. Maya could just get a life and profit off of her own dramatized stories. Obviously she\u2019s writing a trashy novel about her friend for profit\u2026otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be trying to publish it or sharing stories online. \n\nShe\u2019s also just an incredibly bad author if the only thing making her write is listening to her trusted friend talk about tough times during her life.", "So I guess \"based on a true story\" means plagiarism? And again, I clearly stated that the author should've spoken to OP first, which for some reason such a well spoken person as yourself cannot seem to read. And whether you like it or not, it is art. Does a landscape painting not qualify as art either because it's someone's interpretation of what they see? I could go on with examples but I think I've made my point. Just because OP's life story was dramatic enough to be inspiring, doesn't mean it's not art.", "YTA just for manipulatively withholding jurisdiction. Just giving up \"not the US\" to keep the speculation train running.", "Yes, she should have, BEFORE  she wrote it - and if OP had said 'no I am not comfortable with this', she should have abandoned the project.\n\n 'Based on a true story' projects usually  require the person they're about to sign paperwork agreeing to hand over rights to their story - they're not just stolen. \n\nA landscape does not have the agency to 'own' it's image. People do.", "Wow, you really can't read. I literally said the author should have spoken to OP BEFOREHAND... twice. \n\nIf there were enough details changed, which OP has stated there were, it is not plagiarism and you know it bud.\n\nMy point about landscape paintings was about art, not ownership.\n\nL2READ", "Yes, friend, I was agreeing with you. \n\nI do not agree that *the way the author did it as it currently stands* was not plagiarism - I cannot speak to how much they would have to change to make it not plagiarism, but as it stands, the friend very much is the AH, and would be the AH if they continue trying to publish. I get the distinct feeling the reason you're getting so riled up is because your creative works might have something in common with the author in this story. \n\nI supposed plagiarized work is still 'art', even though it's in poor taste, in the same way it would be art if I cropped your username out of your reply, framed it, and offered  it for sale at a local art gallery. Art can be many things even independent of the talents or ethics of their creator. I do think actions like what OPs friends' have taken would lose them reputability and their audience in the field. Personally I would not choose to read the works of such an author. \n\nBut I think this is where I'm ending the conversation. Now that you're screaming insults in capslock I'm not sure further discussion is warranted."]}
