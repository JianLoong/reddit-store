I think your sister didn\u2019t have to go after your parenting, but you did not need to give one to Matt.

If I invite vegan people to an event, I'm expected to provide vegan options to eat. Why isn't it the case the other way around? (I don't personally have an issue with an all-vegan event, but I think it's tricky to impose your diet on your guests). Your sister is T A for her reaction (again, if it was a bbq and someone snapped at a person sneaking in a vegan option votes here would be quite different...), but you're also T A for your own (over)reaction.\n\nEDIT: I'll bet 90% of the people voting and judging on kid's diet and education have 0 kids themselves.", "YTA. Her wedding is not about you or your kids, if your kids can't go without a specific food item for one day then you should have respectfully declined the invite. Instead you smuggle food into a vegan wedding and insult the bride on her wedding day....do you really think you are nta here?", "Is this an actual question?", "YTA - You could have fed your kids prior, in the car, before the wedding or whatever.   Surely there was some other snack you could have brought.  She was out of line in making a big deal about it but you knew what you are were doing and were intentional about so that makes you the bigger AH on that day.", "You're the reason child-free weddings are a thing. Asshole. YTA", "YTA. Bringing food for your child is fine. Handing out the food to other wedding guests crossed the line. This is one of the few days that is all about your sister, she obviously feels strongly about this, and you needed to respect her values. Then yelling at her that her friends didn't like her food and storming out of the wedding made an already bad situation so much worse.", "YTA. I get it, I have a picky eater. But there are options. You could have fed them before, or let them fill up on snacks and feed them properly after. Or this could have been a fantastic teaching moment about respect for others and not always getting what they want. What you did was just rude imo", "YTA", "YTA big time. I would be so insulted if anyone brought food to my wedding, especially if I made most of it myself. That is beyond rude. Worst yet, after being confronted, you double down and yell at your sister, at her wedding. For your mistake. You're also setting your kid up to fail in life by teaching him this is acceptable or healthy behavior.", "YTA. If you thought your kid couldn't behave at a wedding without you having to go against the *bride's* wishes, you shoulda gotten a sitter or stayed home. This was *her* special day.", "YTA. If your kid couldn\u2019t handle the event without getting fussy, don\u2019t take him. Get a babysitter. Or go and leave when he gets cranky. Or one of many solutions other than what you did.", "YTA, you brought the meat to avoid a child tantrum and then you had one anyways. The kids having a tantrum would have been a lot easier for your sister to forgive on her wedding day.", "Why didn't you just feed your kids before the wedding? Or why couldn't you have stepped outside for a little while while they ate their sausages?

Tell the other adults \u201cthis is for my kids\u201d and do it more quietly. There\u2019s no need to make a weird massive scene.", "YTA\n\nCould have fed the kids before and after. This was not appropriate.", "Your child only eats sausage rolls? As in bfast a roll, lunch a roll, dinner a roll, snack a roll? He really doesnt eat anything else?\n\nYou could have brought vegan sausage rolls or taken him outside to eat his roll.\n\nThis seems bizarre to me that at a wedding with all going on that an adult fixes on the fact your son is eating a sausage roll and then comes to ask you if they can have one and then proceeds to tell his mates! \n\nYou try justify your actions by saying my son needs to eat but you knew it was a vegan wedding so bringing meat was a big no no.\n\nYou dont want a sitter as they could do anything like what put rules in place and set some boundries /S\n\nSeems really selfish and shitty you upset your sister on her wedding day over a sausage roll.", "YTA \n\nThis wedding was not about your children. If a vegan wedding is not going to be possible for them to manage, then maybe your family isn\u2019t able to attend. Or maybe your partner stays home with them. Or maybe you bother to put in the effort over the several months leading up to the wedding to meet a childcare provider and get to know them so you can build trust and not \u201cleave them with a random stranger\u201d. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t do is disregard the brides wishes and distribute meat at a vegan event over and over again throughout the night. And what you *really* don\u2019t do is throw a hissy fit screaming at the bride *during her wedding* because you were confronted about your inappropriate behavior.", "YTA\n\nFirst off all it's your sister's wedding, what she wants you do, if she wants you to not eat meat for a few hours, you don't eat meat. Easy as that. She's not asking for a blood sacrifice, just to not eat meat. \n\nSecond of all, if your child is known for throwing temper tantrums when he can't eat what he wants, then you could've either fed him before going to the wedding and told him \"The food at the wedding is the only food there is\" OR you could've left him with a friend of yours since you don't want a stranger. (Also, sorry if it's a sensitive subject but. Where is their father? Why couldn't you leave them with him?) \n\nThird of all, I'm sorry, but your sister is right, you are enabling your son's behaviour. Yeah, it's normal for a seven year old to be picky and occasionally throw a temper tantrum, but your job as a parent is teaching them why it's wrong for him to do it, especially in public. I'm not a parent, but the way I was raised was \"If there's food at the table, you eat that food, you don't ask for something else\". You doing everything your son wants is teaching him that no matter what he wants, mommy will make it happen. I've seen it with my cousin, who would make his mom leave family gatherings earlier because he didn't like the loud noises and didn't like the food. \n\nYes, anger got the best of you both, your sister shouldn't have called tou a bad mother but immediately throwing childish insults at her for calling you out? Really? OP, YTA and honestly the best thing you can do is just apologize to keep the peace, because I just know your relationship with your sister won't recover after you insulted her wedding and cooking and she insulted your parenting.", "So you admit to being overbearing (you say so twice in your post), but you don't see where you might have been an AH?", "Almost went with E S H, because she could've handled it better but I'm sure she was stressed from planning a wedding (and preparing *all* of the food herself) so I'm leaning more YTA. You know she's a hardcore vegan and you brought meat to her *vegan* wedding. That's a violation of her beliefs. I understand wanting snacks for your kids, but you could've fed them beforehand. Then you added insult to injury by giving out meat to one of her guests. \n\nIt's also a little wild to me that a 5 year old gets to dictate what he eats to this extreme.", "YTA. There were a million steps you could have taken to avoid this situation and you chose absolutely none of them. What your sister said about your parenting wasn't kind, but it's absolutely true: you're a bad parent. Being \"overbearing\" isn't something you should be proud of, it's something that you should avoid since it makes you intolerable to deal with and sets your kids up for failure. Shame on you.", "There are even bloody vegan sausages nowadays. You son had eaten those too, you do know that your son is testing your strength right now and you are failing.

Like spaghetti is vegetarian. Mac and cheese is vegetarian. Honestly, grow up.", "ESH: you were good until you started giving the sausage rolls to others. Your sister massively overreacted as is your family. You all seem like you'll be better off without each other.", "YTA. I'm a unrepentant carnivore. And I'm not fond of sanctimonious vegans. But I do realize--and you should too--that for many vegans their dietary path is a matter of principle. And the principles of the wedding couple should not be disrespected at their wedding. If your kid absolutely could not survive without meat for one meal then you should not have brought him. But the reality is that your son probably could have gotten by on the food that was there if you encouraged him. My guess is you did this for your convenience, and your convenience alone.

You're more concerned about being a good parent than a good sister and frankly in this case, you've failed at both.\n\nYour ending point is \"until she takes back what she said about my kid.\" She didn't say anything about your kid, she said things about your parenting. While her blaming the kid's behavior is harsh in your mind, consider that you had the option to literally walk the kid out to your car and eat sausages and then come back. Or even easier, bribe the kid and say you will buy him a toy(his favorite series/current hobby) if we don't eat sausages this afternoon during the wedding. Kids love feeling like they're \"getting one over\" on you!\n\nYou admit to identifying this as a potential problem pre-wedding. However, you took no actions to actually prevent this from happening, let it happen, and then got mad at your sister when she (predictably) saw red on the most important day of her life.

Plenty of people at the wedding probably didn't want to eat the vegan food, of I were there I wouldn't want to, but rather than throw tantrums, the correct response is to eat it anyway and accept that part of life is unfortunately not always getting what you want in that moment. Again, I recognize that this lesson is hard to teach a child, but you are not even making an attempt to correct this behavior! Instead, you are conforming to his wishes, even in inappropriate scenarios like a vegan wedding, teaching him that he can get what he wants, when he wants it, when that's an awful message to be sending to your child! \n\nInstead, you should make it clear that the child will eat what is served at the wedding and if he throws a tantrum he will be removed from the venue immediately. Then, follow through! If he starts to act up, remove him from the venue until he stops crying. You may have to remove your other child(ren?) as well and it's not fair to them, and it's not fair to you that you have to miss out on a chunk of the wedding but no one said that everything about parenting was going to be easy and fair. Alternatively, you could have fed the child the sausage rolls in the car, prior to the wedding, and given him enough food that he'd be full throughout the event so he won't mind that there isn't any food he can eat. This is an equivalent of an adult sneaking out to their car in the middle of a wedding to eat something in their car that they prepared, which in my eyes is fine because it doesn't cause a scene or disrespect anyone as long as they don't tell anyone what they're doing, play it off like they're taking an extra long bathroom trip, and are gone for a short amount of time. \n\nThen you were an asshole right back to her with your comments.

She made a much larger scene than Chase probably would or could have!\n\n\"I did it for the children\". No you didn't, you did it for your own selfishness and because you were too lazy to find alternatives. You need to own up to your behavior.\n\nOP obviously disagrees with her sister's moral and ethical choice to be vegan, despite her declaration to the contrary. \"She is against all animal cruelty and suffering and it is one of the main things I admire her for.\" If OP admired her sister that much, she would have made other arrangements for the children if she felt there could be an issue. Or, she could have been discreet in feeding Chase the sausage rolls by taking him to the car and giving him the food there. But no,that would have been respectful and she was having none of it. As a final parting insult, OP appointed herself the arbiter of all the other attendee's food preferences and informed her sister \"her closest friends didn't even like her food\". Amazingly though, the other guests were eating the food without complaint.\n\nYTA for disrespecting your sister and her husband and having such a negative impact on their wedding celebration.

You're in your 30s, you can get KFC on the way home.", "I'm pretty sure OP intended to disrupt the wedding all along.  Why else would she make no effort at all to be discreet?", "I think attacking her parenting was the out of line part, not that she is vegan.  The OP should have respected her wishes for a vegan reception", "She could've of walked back to car for a few minutes or start teaching her child that his way isn't the final say.

It smells different, tastes different, has a different texture, isn't quite the same colour or shape. Not many 5 year olds with autism are going to take the changes easily without sensory overload or indeed any 5 year old kids. I get the bride is passionate about veganism but the world exists with many different people. As a parent, if you have finicky eaters, you often resolve that at least your child is eating. \nNTA - you didn't overtly denounce the bride's veganism, just wanting your kid to be fed and have a sense of security.\n\n*Edit: spelling (my brain is going faster than my gorilla fingers, \ud83d\ude04).", "The least op could do is tell the sister beforehand and be respectful.

That's why it barely tastes different from the vegan sausage rolls.\n\nI realise a kid might taste and care about the difference but with how OP brought enough for everyone and went straight to insulting her vegan sister I think she just wanted to cause a scene.", "I mean she calls herself an overbearing mother twice in the post itself. \n\nHer comment about babysitters is insane - some people don\u2019t wish to leave their children blah blah blah but the comment itself is overbearing as heck. She comes across as a smoother mother.", "It was the one day of our lives my husband and I had a safe space for food that wasn't our home. You know, how non vegans get to live every day.", "Huh. You make a very good point.  I thought the \u201cadmire her for\u201d being vegan was odd. I thought her descriptions of her kids\u2019 behaviour was odd as well. \n\u201cI still had a lot left over since together they are a truck load.\u201d Um, which is it?\n\nAnd what other immature/hurtful things are we leaving out?\n\nI agree that there is something afoot here.", "She was literally letting them run round the venue with fistfuls of sausage rolls. If she wanted to just discreetly feed her children their only safe food, she would have sat them down and had them eat at the table when everyone else ate (which honestly she should\u2019ve done anyway regardless of what they ate. Who lets kids run around with food at a wedding?)", "The fact that she lets her 5-year-old be such an incredibly picky eater that he'll literally only eat one thing speaks volumes. That kid has not been raised properly.", "He's already going without a healthy, balanced diet. If he's only eating sausage rolls for months and she isn't making him eat anything else, the kid's going to have nutrition problems.", "Its not that strange to not want to use randoms for babysitters. We Only use family If They are not available We dont go", "One would hope that her relatives didn't come down on her for not supporting her sister.  We've had a few Reddit posts about people who try to avoid a wedding for some good reason, only to have the flying monkeys sent after them.\n\nI think the one really AH thing that OP did was insulting and fighting with her sister.", "Honestly, the greggs ones are pretty damn close.", "You don't know that. There are *many* reasons a child could be a picky eater. I know multiple kids who, despite their parents best efforts, are *so* picky that a doctor ended up saying \"Just feed them anything they'll eat - because that is better than them starving. Stop trying to fight it, feed them what they want\". Because some kids will actually literally starve themselves rather than eat something new. \n\nI agree that the way OP handled this makes them TA. But why do redditors *insist* on making assumptions about shit we do not understand? You don't *know* why the kid is picky. Stop pretending you do.", "Yeah, I mean I still wouldn\u2019t eat someone else\u2019s food that I know their kids are eating, but if OP had a line of guests wanting to eat her sausage rolls then the sister needs to understand that people were most likely hungry and definitely\nnot eating the food available. \n\nAnd Matt probably told them, \u201cHey, OP has sausage rolls if you want any\u201d and sent them her way which got the sisters attention and made her cause a scene over it.", "Running around while eating, especially with a mouth full of sausage roll, is also a great way to end up with a choking kid. Source: my seagull of a child.", ">I yelled about how her closest friends didn\u2019t even like her food (most of the food was prepared by her) and some other immature/hurtful things.\n\nThat was where she really crossed the line. I don't have a huge issue with her bringing food to placate the kids, or even giving it to a friend - though super weird that others asked for it???? - but TA for yelling at the sister that everyone hated her food was just over the top.", "Ok thank you! Finally someone I agree with. Jeez. These comments are about to give me a complex about my picky eater. Idk what sausage rolls are?? Like sausage in a roll? Is that literally all they will eat or is that like a thing they eat every day? There\u2019s definitely a difference", "Sure but the workaround isn't to just ignore the rules and do whatever you want. At the least you would talk to your sister and say look, I'm going to have to stuff my handbag with sausage rolls for kid.", "I'm so glad someone said this!  My son has ARFID as well and is now 14 years old.  I'm so sick of being treated like a failure because my child will not eat like other children/teenagers and he's very small. He just did two weeks of inpatient treatment and that got us nowhere so it's not like we are not trying (we had to do that because outpatient got us nowhere).  But I also have always found ways to work around it like you.  Eat in the car before and after.  When people comment that don't know us very well and I don't want to explain why he isn't eating I'd say he hasn't had much of an appetite lately, now he says it himself.  I haven't brought him food where they served a meal like that since he was a toddler and literally couldn't chew it.", "I mean\u2026\n\nIf you know your kid won\u2019t eat the food served, will throw a tantrum, and having a vegetarian wedding is important to the bride, *you make the responsible decision to leave your kid at home*.\n\nA good parent and sister wouldn\u2019t cause a scene and scream at the bride.\n\nOp - YTA and the reason you\u2019re so mad is because what your sister said is correct.", "I think maybe she means the canned ones that look tiny sausages.  They're great rolled up in croissant dough and baked.", "this is my dilemma. yes OP shouldn\u2019t let her kid eat 1 food only and learn to deal with tantrums, but she *hasnt*. if this kid did not get sausage rolls at the wedding he would\u2019ve thrown a tantrum, which likely would\u2019ve also upset the bride. i think the solution here, in this specific situation with the parenting that has already taken place, would be to sneakily feed kiddo sausage rolls in the hall or something, not offer them to the other kiddo if she didn\u2019t ask, and definitely not give them to other guests. OP is TA, but this situation was setup for failure from the beginning. \n\nalso\u2026 i have an inkling this is from the sisters POV bc of the MEAT and VEGAN emphasis in the title and how asshole-ish the writer seems. i feel like she would\u2019ve tried to make herself sound better bc it kinda read like \u201chere\u2019s a story of when i was an asshole\u201d. who knows though with \u201coverbearing moms\u201d like OP."]}
