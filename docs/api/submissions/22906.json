I think your sister didn\u2019t have to go after your parenting, but you did not need to give one to Matt.

If I invite vegan people to an event, I'm expected to provide vegan options to eat. Why isn't it the case the other way around? (I don't personally have an issue with an all-vegan event, but I think it's tricky to impose your diet on your guests). Your sister is T A for her reaction (again, if it was a bbq and someone snapped at a person sneaking in a vegan option votes here would be quite different...), but you're also T A for your own (over)reaction.\n\nEDIT: I'll bet 90% of the people voting and judging on kid's diet and education have 0 kids themselves.", "YTA. Her wedding is not about you or your kids, if your kids can't go without a specific food item for one day then you should have respectfully declined the invite. Instead you smuggle food into a vegan wedding and insult the bride on her wedding day....do you really think you are nta here?", "Is this an actual question?", "YTA - You could have fed your kids prior, in the car, before the wedding or whatever.   Surely there was some other snack you could have brought.  She was out of line in making a big deal about it but you knew what you are were doing and were intentional about so that makes you the bigger AH on that day.", "You're the reason child-free weddings are a thing. Asshole. YTA", "YTA. Bringing food for your child is fine. Handing out the food to other wedding guests crossed the line. This is one of the few days that is all about your sister, she obviously feels strongly about this, and you needed to respect her values. Then yelling at her that her friends didn't like her food and storming out of the wedding made an already bad situation so much worse.", "YTA. I get it, I have a picky eater. But there are options. You could have fed them before, or let them fill up on snacks and feed them properly after. Or this could have been a fantastic teaching moment about respect for others and not always getting what they want. What you did was just rude imo", "YTA", "YTA big time. I would be so insulted if anyone brought food to my wedding, especially if I made most of it myself. That is beyond rude. Worst yet, after being confronted, you double down and yell at your sister, at her wedding. For your mistake. You're also setting your kid up to fail in life by teaching him this is acceptable or healthy behavior.", "YTA. If you thought your kid couldn't behave at a wedding without you having to go against the *bride's* wishes, you shoulda gotten a sitter or stayed home. This was *her* special day.", "YTA. If your kid couldn\u2019t handle the event without getting fussy, don\u2019t take him. Get a babysitter. Or go and leave when he gets cranky. Or one of many solutions other than what you did.", "YTA, you brought the meat to avoid a child tantrum and then you had one anyways. The kids having a tantrum would have been a lot easier for your sister to forgive on her wedding day.", "Why didn't you just feed your kids before the wedding? Or why couldn't you have stepped outside for a little while while they ate their sausages?

Tell the other adults \u201cthis is for my kids\u201d and do it more quietly. There\u2019s no need to make a weird massive scene.", "YTA\n\nCould have fed the kids before and after. This was not appropriate.", "Your child only eats sausage rolls? As in bfast a roll, lunch a roll, dinner a roll, snack a roll? He really doesnt eat anything else?\n\nYou could have brought vegan sausage rolls or taken him outside to eat his roll.\n\nThis seems bizarre to me that at a wedding with all going on that an adult fixes on the fact your son is eating a sausage roll and then comes to ask you if they can have one and then proceeds to tell his mates! \n\nYou try justify your actions by saying my son needs to eat but you knew it was a vegan wedding so bringing meat was a big no no.\n\nYou dont want a sitter as they could do anything like what put rules in place and set some boundries /S\n\nSeems really selfish and shitty you upset your sister on her wedding day over a sausage roll.", "YTA \n\nThis wedding was not about your children. If a vegan wedding is not going to be possible for them to manage, then maybe your family isn\u2019t able to attend. Or maybe your partner stays home with them. Or maybe you bother to put in the effort over the several months leading up to the wedding to meet a childcare provider and get to know them so you can build trust and not \u201cleave them with a random stranger\u201d. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t do is disregard the brides wishes and distribute meat at a vegan event over and over again throughout the night. And what you *really* don\u2019t do is throw a hissy fit screaming at the bride *during her wedding* because you were confronted about your inappropriate behavior.", "YTA\n\nFirst off all it's your sister's wedding, what she wants you do, if she wants you to not eat meat for a few hours, you don't eat meat. Easy as that. She's not asking for a blood sacrifice, just to not eat meat. \n\nSecond of all, if your child is known for throwing temper tantrums when he can't eat what he wants, then you could've either fed him before going to the wedding and told him \"The food at the wedding is the only food there is\" OR you could've left him with a friend of yours since you don't want a stranger. (Also, sorry if it's a sensitive subject but. Where is their father? Why couldn't you leave them with him?) \n\nThird of all, I'm sorry, but your sister is right, you are enabling your son's behaviour. Yeah, it's normal for a seven year old to be picky and occasionally throw a temper tantrum, but your job as a parent is teaching them why it's wrong for him to do it, especially in public. I'm not a parent, but the way I was raised was \"If there's food at the table, you eat that food, you don't ask for something else\". You doing everything your son wants is teaching him that no matter what he wants, mommy will make it happen. I've seen it with my cousin, who would make his mom leave family gatherings earlier because he didn't like the loud noises and didn't like the food. \n\nYes, anger got the best of you both, your sister shouldn't have called tou a bad mother but immediately throwing childish insults at her for calling you out? Really? OP, YTA and honestly the best thing you can do is just apologize to keep the peace, because I just know your relationship with your sister won't recover after you insulted her wedding and cooking and she insulted your parenting.", "So you admit to being overbearing (you say so twice in your post), but you don't see where you might have been an AH?", "Almost went with E S H, because she could've handled it better but I'm sure she was stressed from planning a wedding (and preparing *all* of the food herself) so I'm leaning more YTA. You know she's a hardcore vegan and you brought meat to her *vegan* wedding. That's a violation of her beliefs. I understand wanting snacks for your kids, but you could've fed them beforehand. Then you added insult to injury by giving out meat to one of her guests. \n\nIt's also a little wild to me that a 5 year old gets to dictate what he eats to this extreme.", "YTA. There were a million steps you could have taken to avoid this situation and you chose absolutely none of them. What your sister said about your parenting wasn't kind, but it's absolutely true: you're a bad parent. Being \"overbearing\" isn't something you should be proud of, it's something that you should avoid since it makes you intolerable to deal with and sets your kids up for failure. Shame on you.", "There are even bloody vegan sausages nowadays. You son had eaten those too, you do know that your son is testing your strength right now and you are failing.

Like spaghetti is vegetarian. Mac and cheese is vegetarian. Honestly, grow up.", "ESH: you were good until you started giving the sausage rolls to others. Your sister massively overreacted as is your family. You all seem like you'll be better off without each other.", "YTA. I'm a unrepentant carnivore. And I'm not fond of sanctimonious vegans. But I do realize--and you should too--that for many vegans their dietary path is a matter of principle. And the principles of the wedding couple should not be disrespected at their wedding. If your kid absolutely could not survive without meat for one meal then you should not have brought him. But the reality is that your son probably could have gotten by on the food that was there if you encouraged him. My guess is you did this for your convenience, and your convenience alone.

You're more concerned about being a good parent than a good sister and frankly in this case, you've failed at both.\n\nYour ending point is \"until she takes back what she said about my kid.\" She didn't say anything about your kid, she said things about your parenting. While her blaming the kid's behavior is harsh in your mind, consider that you had the option to literally walk the kid out to your car and eat sausages and then come back. Or even easier, bribe the kid and say you will buy him a toy(his favorite series/current hobby) if we don't eat sausages this afternoon during the wedding. Kids love feeling like they're \"getting one over\" on you!\n\nYou admit to identifying this as a potential problem pre-wedding. However, you took no actions to actually prevent this from happening, let it happen, and then got mad at your sister when she (predictably) saw red on the most important day of her life.

You argued with her and walked out on her wedding.

You could have eaten in the car before you entered the venue.\n\nBut you CHOSE this. You intentionally made the wedding about you and your children. That's selfish and disgusting, and you're only making a fool of yourself. You're not being super mom.
