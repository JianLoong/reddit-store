I personally would not go to the meal or just cancel it and not tell her at all. Infact, you should break up with her and find someone better because if this relationship was to go anywhere where she ends up being your wife, you would want someone that looks as expenses jointly and not as me pay and you pay or I will pay for my mum etc.", "NTA just cancel that table and let her take her mom on a date instead. Just have some time to think about her lack of respect and the inequality you are putting up with in this relationship.", "NTA. Your GF sounds a bit like my sister. Which is just about never a good thing to do.\n\nShe disregarded your feelings, went explicitly against your wishes, and then claimed you were making her \"feel bad\" when you pointed out facts.", "INFO: Why didn't you just let your girlfriend and her mum go out to dinner together, since that's evidently what your gf wanted to do?", "NTA- you are a resource. Her priority isn\u2019t you.", "But why bring up the unrelated issue of whos paying for dates at that time? Just seems to add fuel to the fire and prevent you from having a productive discussion about the MIL issue.", "A romantic night out does not include her mother. The fact that she over-rode your wishes is disturbing. Let her and her mother enjoy their night out.", "NTA. As other commenters pointed out, just don't go. Let them enjoy a night out. You use the time to relax and think long and hard about whether this is an isolated case, or is she in general this dismissive of your feelings.", "NTA. Personally, I would cancel the table or let the girlfriend take her mother to dinner alone. She invited her mother allow to a dinner you planned against your wishes after you already told her no and is now only focusing on her feelings and what she wants while accusing you of starting arguments. I have a feeling that while she claims she would pay for her mother, she would suddenly realise she didn't have enough money when you went to the dinner itself and expect you to take care of it for her.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t seem to have any respect for your feelings. Don\u2019t let her gaslight you. It\u2019s very rude for her to invite her mom when you clearly stated no. Also, paying for her mom but not you ever just adds on to it. The reservations are for 2, I would just let them go together.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't go. Let her have dinner with the person she loves the most. \n\nFind a girlfriend who will pay for at least one meal in two years."]}
