Fought me over the bill in front of waiters, etc. My paying was an affront to his ego, and went against the roles that his traditional family taught him.  He'd get offended, like I was implying he wasn't capable.  It was awkward to fight, so I gave up and let him have his way.  So, especially during the early courtship phase, did you inadvertently set the expectation that you would pay?

Cause that's what she did.  \n\nThose are red flags \ud83d\udea9  \n\nYou made reservations for a romantic night.... Your gf doesn't want that, that's why she insisted her mum comes. That's also why she paid for her mum to make sure her mum comes. Remember expensive place and her mum might not have come otherwise \n\nYou both are not on the same page. \n\nYou might just be \"Plan B\". Keep you around till something better comes.
