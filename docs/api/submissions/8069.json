One minute we're conversing and the next he's just looking at me with a funny look on his face.\n\nIn the beginning, when he snapped out of them, he would try to cover them up by playing along with whatever he thought I said last. As time goes by, he's less concerned about hiding it, and more comfortable with me letting him know what happened.\n\nThe key might be to see if this happens any other time. It could be hard to pick up on, but if you keep an eye out, you may see it when he's doing other things - just spacing out for a little bit.\n\nThis would be important to get checked out, because absence seizures can be really dangerous. And if this is new behavior, there could *definitely* be something medical behind it.\n\nIt could also be an issue with his hearing, especially in noisy places like restaurants.

It's not normal for someone to have THIS much of an issue constantly not perceiving someone talking to them. Of course everyone has times when they're distracted or could be simply not listening but for it to be this intrusive isn't normal, and you know it. If it's neurological, there are things that can be done to accommodate and if he's actually a disinterested partner that's also not normal. I don't throw out names of disorders to armchair diagnose him, just to state that we have really complex brains that don't necessarily process in expected ways. Getting a proper diagnosis is a team effort between the subject and their healthcare workers and families. We have a lot of expectations for how people SHOULD behave but not enough of a skillset to deal with unexpected behaviours or feeling like we're being disrespected. It's incumbent on you to teach yourself better communication mechanisms rather than storming out. It's incumbent on him to take your feelings into consideration and focus on what he can do to be better as well. \n\nUse \"I\" statements when you talk to him. Repeat what you've said. \"I feel like you're somewhere else right now and you've missed what Ive said and what Ive been saying is important to me and it's important to me to hear your thoughts on it.\" Something along those lines. \n\nPerhaps walking out wasn't the most mature behaviour but you haven't learned the tools to handle it in better ways yet.

I certainly don\u2019t come back and say \u201coh oops lol squirrel!\u201d each time", "I don't have ADD or ADHD, but I do have BPD, which tends to come with lack of focus and noisy thoughts.   And I think very fast.\n\nIt's super common for me to have my thoughts off on a tangent before you've even finished your thought, miss the middle, and be back for the ending.\n\nIt's pretty rare for me to explain where my thoughts went, my reaction is usually just a \"Wait, what?\", assuming I even noticed I missed what you said.\n\nYou can't make such a general statement about how people act.", "if the partner gives him shit when he says he is zoned out he may have resorted to just saying that he was listening as a defense", "Yep, I'm a woman. I can't always remember to try to talk lower and appreciate people trying to meet me halfway.", "Me too. And I looked like asshole not knowing that somebody told something to me. I wasn't aware of timeskips - and I was confused after seizure. I was geniuly thinking that people are assholes to me. In reality none of us were assholes, and a bit of daily meds fixed it. I am feeling way bwtter in general.\n\nI recommend doing to neurologist to anyone with those experiances. Especially if somebody has also: unexpected sudden feeling of fear/anxiety without source, not controllable laught, auditory, smell or tactile hallucinations, a lot of deja vu or jamais vu. It might be temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nNot every epileptic person is shaking. And all epilepsies are worth treating.", "My daughter has these and they can look a lot like someone is zoning out. They will have no memory of anything while it was happening. Can last a few seconds or minutes\n\nMight be he is just an inconsiderate AH but might be worth seeing a neurologist just in case.\n\nETA: NTA", ">No shit Sherlock my mind had left the building and only the body remained. \n\nI'm sorry you went through this. Also this line has me **cackling**", "It's definitely worth looking into. \nBefore I was officially diagnosed with Epilepsy there was a summer I spent a couple weeks with grandparents. My grandmother called my mom because she was angry I was ignoring her and she didn't know why. When my mom talked to me about it I had no clue what she or my grandma was talking about it. I could only think of one possible incident when I got conflicting answers from her and grandpa. \n\nYears later I had a tonic clonic and was diagnosed with generalized epilepsy. Which means I have many different kinds of seizures. We finally figured out that summer I probably was having absence seizures and I just had no idea they were happening. \n\nNAH\n\nI think it's time to have a talk. Tell him what you've noticed. What it looks like when he doesn't hear you. Ask him if he can remember any instances lately where it seems like he missed time or didn't know about something important that he should've known according to others. \n\nDefinitely talk to a doctor.", "Sooo say I developed a twitch and every once in a while when I am standing around I twitch and my knees give out, but I never hit the floor.. Could it be that quick?", "Ironically, the opposite happened to me. My first grade teacher was a doctor's wife and she kept telling my mom I *must* be having seizures since I spent all my time staring out the window. Nope - I just listen better if I'm not looking at anything.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! My MIL is deaf in one ear and if you talk to her on that side it will look like she\u2019s ignoring you, but really she just can\u2019t hear a word!", "Disassociation is the name for the symptom :) it's nice to have a name for things", "he\u2019s an AH is my guess too, but it never hurts to see a doctor to rule out something else", "Fingers crossed it's \"just\" hearing loss.\n\nBut my dad would literally zone out and then say something pleasant when he was deep in his ms", "I would say talk to a Dr about your concerns. \n\nMy grandmother's early onset Parkinson's symptoms were palsy, facial tics, and forgetting things she knew. Like my name. \n\nNot to downplay your symptoms. Talk to a doctor about your concerns. \n\nMy dad, when he had MS, would zone out and not be aware of it, not be thinking about anything, them snap back to and say something pleasant. He was aware he missed something when he snapped back. But it was like hitting a light switch where his brain was off and then back on. \n\nNothing to do with daydreaming. But still. Talk to a doctor if you have medical concerns.\n\nEdit** because my not English brain misread not paying attention for daydreaming.", ">two months ago seems odd for ADHD, though\n\nI agree completely, just pointed there as someone to be looked at as it can be an easier fix than a neurological disorder.", "Yes! This is important...especially if you can capture his facial expression while he's zoning out. Facial expressions can be important clues as to what is going on.", "As many here have noted, it\u2019s entirely possible he has no clue what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s possible that to him he was having a nice meal with his wife and suddenly she\u2019s storming out while insisting he\u2019s ignoring her. From his perspective then she\u2019d be in the wrong because he wouldn\u2019t have a memory of the ten minutes he was unresponsive.", "This is totally plausible. Like instead of asking her to repeat herself he just guesses what the rest of her sentence is.", "Yep! This is exactly what people with hearing loss do.", "You realize that doesn't really make sense right? Between what is described in OP and this comment thread, the whole point is that your internal perception of sensory experience cannot be objective and is inherently unreliable. \n\n\nYou should go get checked out if you are able too, don't fear what is already happening but unknown", "OP would be an AH if she ignored the issue now that people suggested it, but I don't think is fair to call her the AH just because she didn't relate a somehow new behavior, mostly during the stress of years end, to a medical issue. \n\n\nPeople saying E S H are being unnecessarily harsh on her.", "I mean, it could have been that he just plain misheard. It happens.\n\nOr maybe he really has mentally checked out of the relationship. It really could be a little thing or a big thing, we don't know enough.", "I sorted by \"Old\" and nobody mentioned the possibility of medical issues until after OP had responded to this. I'm gonna hold out hope that OP hasn't responded to anything else because once a bunch of responses about potential medical issues came in she realized they may be right and is handling that rather than replying to more comments here.", "As a Dad, I resent that remark.  That would have been a fantastic Dad joke.", "Not sure about the joke thing, but definitely agree that neither person sounds happy here.", "This is exactly how I took it. OP quoted herself saying \u201cI\u2019m think I\u2019m getting a headache,\u201d exactly as if she had said \u201cI think I\u2019m getting an appetizer\u201d or something. They\u2019re literally sitting at the table looking at menus when she said it. Husband made a dad joke about what she just said, that he obviously heard, and OP went ballistic.\n \nBut of course on AITA, which is apparently the WebMD of Reddit, he\u2019s having absence seizures and a plethora of other undiagnosed medical conditions. Because of a dad joke.", "Yeah - people do that when they\u2019re overwhelmed. Walk a mile in their shoes before abandoning them.\nI would hope you wouldn\u2019t want your friends and loved ones to sever ties with you over something like this.\n\nJumping straight to divorce is frankly unhinged.", "Sorry,iam not English. It just doesn't sound similar to me. Not in the slightest.", "Ditto!", "I directly forget what it's going on. \n\nLike... I'm having a normal convo, and suddenly, my brain's equivalent to the Windows blue screen of death pops up, and I no longer have any idea of what I was talking about. It doesn't happen very often, but by Talos, it's annoying.", "Weed also causes anger issues; I just recently found this out. Fucking GREAT lol", "Right sometimes of be so far gone that I wouldn't even respond to my name before my meds", "Only slightly related: I have never heard that Borderline also is associated with lack of focus and noisy thoughts. I have several family members with that diagnosis and would love to read whatever you have that supports that as symptoms. (I know this comes off as shitty and truly I 10000% promise I am curious out of support).", "There are several types of seizures. I worked with a child who would occasionally have a quick muscle jerk, and then it was over. And those were seizures. Sounds a little bit like what you\u2019re experiencing.", "Yes. \nI never knew a thing and didn\u2019t ever fall while walking, the closest was I nearly twisted my ankle, the body is geared to keep you going and not fall.", "I used to be a 1-to-1 aid for a student with seizures exactly like that.", "True.", "Not my symptoms but we have a family history of alzheimers and parkinson. I wasnt born yet when they developed their first symptom and now a generation after them seems developing some. I suspect it and others do too but some say its just getting old and normal. That shit is scary af. Saying things twice in a row (in two minutes) bc they forgot, the thing I already mentioned, preparing a second plate of food and realising there already is one, made-up memories.", "My dad was also diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s a few years ago. But even before he was diagnosed we started noticing he would zone out a lot. Especially in larger social settings.", "ADHD is neurological disorder and, at least in my cases and in most people I know is harder to resolve. I have epilepsy, ADHD and migraines and epilepsy after getting iit finally diagnosed was easiest (and only one possible) to fix. However my adhd meds made me less likely to have seizure too. :p", "Can confirm. Sometimes we are just \"gambling\" around. Do not recommend :/", "Totally agree with you! My mum fought hearing aids so hard you would have thought we were trying to measure her for a pine box.\n\nWe just wanted to go over for coffee and a chat without shouting over the volume of the TV.", "I promise that wasn\u2019t a slight! Personally I\u2019m a big fan of corny jokes", "one person in the relationship ignoring everything the other says for 2 months is not just an \"argument\"", "That's why I mentioned couples counseling.\n\nBut I hate to say it if you are asking someone for couple's counseling and they refuse, there is no future there.", "This happens to me frequently with my ADHD. But I definitely recognize it when it happens.", "Oh that definitely happens, but I'm aware it's happening,and I just tell people \"hello yes my neurons did not fire I forgot the last 30 seconds, can you repeat that?\" Instead of just making agree noises or whatever", "Yeah it does, I think the situation I mention also had a little sprinkle of projection, feeling like people were calling her dumb.", "Omg i have this too! Mine were \"absence\" & \"twitching\".\n\nI had the twitching since i was little...like 6-7(8?) so my family wasn't worried at first since i had it for a long time and nothing bad happened so far - they just thought that these were tics - just random movement,nothing serious,right?\n\nWell yes,but actually no. Got my first seizure all of sudden and my sibling described it as \"at first she twitched and later did absent staring at one point without moving or blinking (+not responding when called) and then she had the seizure.\" \n\nMy family was scared shtless and began to send me to all kind of doctors,who diagnosed me with epilepsy.", "Twitching is still not really strange. Do you know that seizure might be uncontrollable laughter when somebody doesn't want it and cannot stop? It is scary. Or anxiety without source. I hate having those.", "Well I guess it's a good thing I made that neurologist appointment then. When I posted myself twitching to TIKTOK last week I got warnings left right and center.", "Yeah. So. Neurologist next week \ud83d\udc4d", "Also getting annoyed when people address something that happened. Like I'm not telling you you left a pot of boiling water on the stove to be mean. I'm not reminding you certain people are deceased to be mean. But it's a reflex to be annoyed rather than confront your neurological issues.", "My dad was always so introverted we assumed he would zone out in social settings. \n\nHugz tho. Neurological diseases are a sum bich. Both for those that have them and the people who love them.", "I can relate to that. Not so often, it's more like mishearing,but still... It's annoying and can be kinda funny sometimes", "Really? No examination of hang ups around therapy? Possible caveats or barriers to address. Just an absolutist \u201cIf\u2014>Then\u201d for determining the end state of a complex human relationship.

Oh fuck.", "Oop... Well. Hope mine go away when my body is aligned \ud83d\ude2c", "Always better to go several times for nothing than to not go the one time it\u2019s something.", "Yes denial is a big thing. Neurological issues are scary and you can not \"just eat healthy, excercise, rest, take medicine x\" it away.

But how to get them out of it idk.", "Yeah it sucks!", "What's worrying me for OP is while her frustration is understandable... That snap back thing is such a telling sign. Especially saying something randomly pleasant to try to cover for it.", "Meniere\u2019s Disease. What I hear out of my left ear is jumbled. Often I hear a rhyme instead of what was said (\u201cI need a break\u201d becomes \u201cI need a steak\u201d, etc.). Some of this is the brain trying to fill in the gap between what you heard and what you think you should have heard.

What do you expect to change with your suggestions?", "I know I messed up . I've been working really hard on myself and I know the twitching has to do with my body functioning wrong in many ways for a very long time. I can feel where the twitches are usually generating from and most of the time it's because I am actively working on muscles that will shift my body back to how it should be. But yeah... I guess I probably should have checked sooner than four five years? \ud83d\ude33", "I'm sorry you're caught in the middle. I always was just like ok... Treat my dad like he would treat me.

I get diagnosis and meds when I was 26. 4/5 years is kinda quick. \n\nWhat is more funny - becouse of different condition I had neurologist. She is specialist of migraines and epilepsy. \n\nAnd I had NO IDEA that I should tell my dr about memory los, hallucinations, sudden anxiety and also - bit of twitching, I just assumed that it is normal and everyone is like that. I just was ignorant enought to think that I have to fall and shake to have epilepsy. Internet educated me that epilepsy can be like my experiences and I got my diagnosis really quickly. And it was really awkward appointment. And I am feeling a lot better on meds. :)\n\nBut as you now know - go to doctor ASAP, get checked. It will be fine whatever doc will discover. :)", "Thank u!", "Yep I'm in the process of getting diagnosed but this is definitely the experience I've had.", "Sorry it took me so long, I was busy giving your dad a hot beef injection.", "I have always had bad memory, never hallucinated, and the twitching comes and goes I assumed according to how fucked up my body was that day or which was it was being pulled...

I had tried to figure out what was wrong but fighting against depression and anxiety to get even to the Dr or massage was one thing but putting in the actual work when I can't even shower myself........... I just figured it was because I was fat. Nobody guided me properly as an adolescent and I was SO FUCKED UP. Lucky for me I found an amazing husband and was able with his emotional support and love, to finally get somewhere. I started with talk therapy. Then physical therapy. Then found a fucking MIRACLE massage lady who is now basically covering physical therapy as well with her knowledge I've been able to do things that no Dr would ever fucking have helped me do.
