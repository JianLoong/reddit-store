One minute we're conversing and the next he's just looking at me with a funny look on his face.\n\nIn the beginning, when he snapped out of them, he would try to cover them up by playing along with whatever he thought I said last. As time goes by, he's less concerned about hiding it, and more comfortable with me letting him know what happened.\n\nThe key might be to see if this happens any other time. It could be hard to pick up on, but if you keep an eye out, you may see it when he's doing other things - just spacing out for a little bit.\n\nThis would be important to get checked out, because absence seizures can be really dangerous. And if this is new behavior, there could *definitely* be something medical behind it.\n\nIt could also be an issue with his hearing, especially in noisy places like restaurants.

A full physical, including you telling his doctor about what you're seeing, is really important.", "> They will have no memory of anything while it was happening\n\nwell thats not the case with the husband. He responds to op saying something, but not to what was said", "I know I personally hate asking people to repeat themselves too often. Easier just to let something pass by or guess what it was if it seems to need a response.", "I kinda feel like maybe he would've explained that after she freaked out though. Just a simple \"hey I was just making a joke\" or something? But maybe not", "It's possible that he's been losing his hearing for awhile, and it's just been in the last two months that it's bad enough that he can't hide it or he can't understand what others are saying.\n\nIf he's just staring at her while she's speaking, he may be just trying really hard to figure out what she's saying (or why he can't figure out what she's saying),or he's trying to hide that he's losing his hearing.", "I agree! Could have been a goofy joke (I almost said funny but didn\u2019t want you to judge my dad humor) but if it was I think he would have said so", "Sounds like gaslighting to me.", "Omg so accurate. I'm pretty certain I have *some* kind of audio processing issue but it's a diagnosis of exclusion (ruling out everything else). But I struggle to listen to someone speaking for very long, I have to very actively focus otherwise my brain interprets it as background noise and tunes it out or just fills in gaps exactly how you describe.\n\n(I suspect it might be a symptom of something else, too. I'm pretty confident I have some degree of autism and I also have quite a few symptoms of ADHD but I'm less sure about that.)", "This is what we do when one of my kids has a neurological event. We record them, and play it back for the neurologist in the next appointment.", "I started having what I could only describe as audio dyslexia after some sound damage. I could hear people talking but it would be gibberish, and only every so often. It was a very frustrating few months until I realized that it was definitely something wrong with *me* and not some weird joke people around me were committed to (it happened intermittently so the people who spoke to me most often had it happen the most, making it look somewhat deliberate lol)\n\nAnd yeah. When people assumed I was getting it wrong on purpose I got pretty defensive.", "Your friend did not have surgery if all they had were absences. Surgery is not the treatment of choice. If it was easy to film, it\u2019s not absences.", "I do exactly the same!", "Tell him that if he's so sure, you'll buy him dinner (or whatever) and stop bringing it up if the doctor proves you wrong. It's not certain, especially if he's dug his feet in, but it might work.", "My brother noticed on his running app on his phone that he was stopping and standing in one place for a while with no memory thereof.  He had had (if I have this right) a brain bleed of some sort that caused the iron in the dried blood to \"short circuit\" him into these absent seizures.  And he did indeed have surgery.    \n\n\nI think one could have filmed him running along and standing still randomly?  no?", "I make everyone at work email me. And I'm blunt about it - like I will 100% listen to you if you call me or come to my desk, but there is a huge chance that I either won't remember what you asked, or I will remember what was asked but will forget who asked me. So either way, it's in your best interest to put it in my email.", "Thank you for giving me the necessary shift in the right direction. Always thought I don't need a diagnosis even if i have ADHD but this was way too accurate and now I'm curious", "I just assumed dad joke lol", "Since you said this just started 2 months ago, definitely may want to talk to a doctor", "am I this cousin? J/K, but only kind of... I have this type of epilepsy and was nearly kicked out of both HS and undergrad.  \n\n\nI have three master's degrees. Too many people think seizures = stupid.", "I get to have lots of fun, because I have both absence seizures AND auditory processing issues thanks to ADHD!  \n\n\nThese two need to have an actual conversation, possibly with a doctor. Stat.", "just found out I have ADHD too. Explains sooo much omg.", "This sounds a lot like me", "Could very well be, especially if he took you somewhere that he goes a lot otherwise. I've gone out meaning to go to Target, for example, and then my autopikot kicks in and I go to the grocery store instead. And if I need to stop at the post office, which is literally on the street I drive down to get to the store, I have to keep the thing I need to mail in my hand while I drive or I'll switch off and drive right by. I've done that so many times, it's really frustrating. One time I actually went into the grocery store and got to the produce section with a cart before I was like \"...why am I here? I was supposed to be getting prescriptions at CVS.\"\n\nOr the time I used the self checkout and got so distracted by a new credit card reader that I walked out without any of the groceries, just me and an empty cart. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Do you get upset when the dream was better? Because I do. What was really bizarre was doing that in class", "It's not about what he looks like, it's about whether or not he realizes she's filming it was the point.", "Why can't life have subtitles?", "I'm a big fan of voice notes, because I get to hear my friends voice, but I can also replay it as many times as I need! \ud83d\ude0a", "There's a fairly important medical appointment coming up soon. I've been documenting everything - I hope it will be useful? I'm so worried for him. We can't talk about it - he accuses me of being paranoid, seeing things that aren't there...", "It's important to note, because a lot of people, myself included before meeting my girlfriend who gets seizures, not all seizures involve movement\n \nThere are something called absent seizures, where the person will... check out, for a bit, likely completely freeze. It may even seem like they are ignoring you in that moment\n \nAlso. Not all seizures have a photosensitive trigger, there can be all kinds of different triggers, including stress, nerves, etc.", ">2. He\u2019s having seizures \n\nOP, look into Silent Seizures", "I'd even say YTA, because she immediately assumed her husband was deliberately ignoring her even though he clearly didn't hear her properly.", "This!! I experience absent seizures and they also cause me to respond to conversations as well with weird responses and not know it until I snap \u201cback to reality\u201d and whoever I\u2019m with tells me I had an episode. that don\u2019t make sense which is possible why he said what he\u2019s cause it may of him coming to and didn\u2019t want to admit he had one. Particularly seizure can be SUPER scary to people who don\u2019t understand what is going on.", "Sincere question....did you always have them or did it start when you were  in school?\nHow long would it last?", "Not saying you're wrong but if you think \"my wife is getting a headache from staring at the menu unable to make a choice,\" how is \"get whatever!\" a helpful response?", "That I didn't know. They cost a couple grand though, so I'd hope people would see the doctor first. That copay has got to be cheaper.", "Commented exactly the same thing. It sounds like they both haven\u2019t done nearly enough to discuss this at home first and just waited until things boiled up in a public space which was the wrong approach.", "My cousin had this kind of epilepsy and had *thousands* of absence seizures a day. \n\nBefore they figured it out, his parents were worried they were going to have to institutionalize him because he had these violent outbursts and he was 6\u20195 by the time he was 15. \n\nHe had to have a lobectomy, but it worked.", "That's aphasia and it's really common for there to be a pattern like having more trouble with nouns. It's a symptom of a bunch of different neurological problems and definitely worth bringing to a doctor.", "Jeebus, this is me. now I'm wondering if I have ADHD.", "Do you even care about your husband? The things you are explaining could be something serious with him? I know he may not mean to do it. If he stares off into absolutely nothing this could be a sign to get some help. \n\nYTA. Who storms off like a kid? You seriously could not just sit there long enough to eat? I am sure he felt ridiculous after being left there and everyone watching when you storm off. He obviously was trying to do something for you. It's a restaurant is there a chance he really didn't hear you? It was not the time nor the place. Talk about that at home. Not over dinner where anyone and everyone is now watching. You made yourself look like a child in front of everyone there.", "Look into central auditory processing disorder", "yta. why don\u2019t you care about your bfs health or possible medical problem over your ego?? it\u2019s clearly not in character and his spacing out is not normal", "A previous coworker of mine didn't know she was epileptic. Her family just assumed she had ADHD because she zoned out a lot. After she got her license she got into a traumatic car crash that left her hospitalized for a year. It can be extremely dangerous so if that is the case I hope he gets help soon.", "I used to have this happen.  Oddly, thanks to your comment, I've just realized it hasn't happened since I started taking supplements my doctor recommended I try to decrease the frequency of my light sensitivity triggered migraines.

Sometimes my brain straight-up refuses to register the words a person said for a really long time. Like I *heard* them, it's not my hearing, but it sounded like incoherent gibberish. Until a few seconds later when I ask wtf they just said, and *then* it clicks and my brain goes \"Wait, no - we actually do know what they said!
