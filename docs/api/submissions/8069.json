One minute we're conversing and the next he's just looking at me with a funny look on his face.\n\nIn the beginning, when he snapped out of them, he would try to cover them up by playing along with whatever he thought I said last. As time goes by, he's less concerned about hiding it, and more comfortable with me letting him know what happened.\n\nThe key might be to see if this happens any other time. It could be hard to pick up on, but if you keep an eye out, you may see it when he's doing other things - just spacing out for a little bit.\n\nThis would be important to get checked out, because absence seizures can be really dangerous. And if this is new behavior, there could *definitely* be something medical behind it.\n\nIt could also be an issue with his hearing, especially in noisy places like restaurants.
