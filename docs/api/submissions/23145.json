I\u2019ve had lots of help from my family and friends planning it so I\u2019m very excited. I knew I wanted to have a small bridal party of only the most important girls in my life, so I asked my best friend who i\u2019ll call Kayla for privacy reasons, my other friend Merissa, and my sister in law Bria. \n\nKayla has been my best friend since we were in kindergarten. We\u2019ve always been inseparable and she truly means the world to me. That was until my sister in law called me last week in hysterics and told me Kayla had been harassing her for months about her weight and how she\u2019d texted Bria multiple times saying she was \u201cunfit\u201d to be my bridesmaid. She told me she tried to keep quiet so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with it but after Kayla sent her a message (yes she provided proof) calling her a \u201cundeserving cow\u201d she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nBria is like an older sister to me and upon hearing this I instantly called Kayla and told her she\u2019d be removed from my bridal party and unless she spent some serious time rethinking her actions and growing as a person, she had no business being in my life. She tried to explain herself saying she was jealous of Bria and how close I was with her especially since I got engaged. She said she felt replaced and let her anger take over her emotions. \n\nI understand it can be hard for her seeing me be closer to somebody other than her but to treat someone else like that just seems so deranged and not excusable whatsoever. I love Kayla and it hurts to remove her from my bridal party and my life as well but I don\u2019t feel safe keeping her near Bria and I don\u2019t want someone who acts and thinks like that around me. She\u2019s been posting about it on her instagram stories and our mutual friends have been giving me shit for it saying i\u2019m a bitch for choosing Bria over Kayla. I don\u2019t regret taking her out but with how many messages I\u2019ve been getting about it and even people saying they won\u2019t come to my wedding anymore, I don\u2019t know how to feel.", "created_utc": 1690334310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159rfyx/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_bridal/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's jealous that you're closer to someone else than with her, so instead of asking you to spend more time together or trying to express her feelings, she bullies another person, who's done nothing wrong, to the point of tears? Uh-uh. You don't want this woman in your wedding, and maybe not in your life. Anyone giving you shit either didn't hear the full story, or isn't worth keeping around, so give them one chance to learn the truth and otherwise, be grateful the trash is taking itself out.", "NTA,\nAnd honestly if people won\u2019t come because you won\u2019t let Kaia bully your sister in law you\u2019re better off without them. Seriously though do they know what she said because at this point I\u2019d just post it on my insta and let everyone decide", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, so you have the authority to do with the guest lists what you want. \n\nUndeserving cow is a pretty intense choice of words. The fact she was able to orchestrate it all behind your back but still applied enough pressure that they didn\u2019t immediately bring it up to you is also unnerving. \n\nYour former friend seems to have an obsessive type personality, and you probably never saw it as she was obsessed with being your best friend. Who knows how many other people and relationships you missed out on because she was working behind the scenes.", "NTA. Kayla\u2019s behavior was inexcusable. Your actions and feelings are 100% justified. Thank you for taking up for Bria.", "NTA.  BODY SHAMING CANNOT BE TOLERATED!  You did the absolute right thing and anyone who says otherwise is inexcusably wrong.  Kayla and all her supporters must be excommunicated.  Carry on, bride.  May your happiness match your courage.", ">our mutual friends have been giving me shit for it saying i\u2019m a bitch for choosing Bria over Kayla. \n\nThis is the kind of bs I hate. You were perfectly fine with both of them, but then Kayla went batshit. Harassing your SIL privately, and then continuing to complain on Insta, is unacceptable behaviour, and those friends of yours are either believing the lies, or are not your friend.\n\nNTA, and well done for not putting up with this and protecting your SIL.", "NTA.  Sometimes the trash takes itself out.", "NTA here. Bria did not deserve the jealous rage of an unhappy woman. We don't have time to treat other women like that. No one deserves to be harassed in that manner, and you did the right thing by sticking up for her. If your \"best friend\" can't respect your sister in law, what's to stop them from doing the same to you or your partner?", "NTA and if your 'friends' who are supporting Kayla know the extent of her behavior and are still backing her, they are not your friend. Kayla's behavior is deplorable and I'm not at all surprised to know that you want no part of that in your life.", "NTA. Kayla\u2019s response trashing you to everyone tells you what kind of person she is. Good riddance.", "So instead of communicating her concerns about your friendship she decided to harass and bully someone who isn't at fault.\n\nIf the friendship was so important she could have treated as such and talked to you.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nAnyone who drops you for this is trash. You were protecting your sister in law from an AH bully. Anyone who sides with the bully is no friend. It\u2019s a good way to weed awful people out of your life. I\u2019d consider it a blessing in disguise. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA its a reasonable response to her shit", "Nta. Post in your social media what kayla sent to bria calling her an undeserving cow and let that sink in to your friends and family. Dont be complacent . Kayla is ruining your wedding and youre doing nothing. Youre not in the wrong here . Kayla is not yiur best friend anymore. Shes out to ruin yiur wedding to spite you and playing victim", "NTA and no you chose someone who cared enough about you to try and put their own feelings aside to not muck with your friendship over someone who made an active decision to be toxic to someone solely because you were spending time around them.  If your friends think that's the wrong decision they aren't your friends.", "\"I was jealous and felt replaced\" is an *explanation*, but it's not an excuse. Kayla had so many other options. \n\nShe could have acknowledged her feelings, recognized how unjustified they were, and resolved to keep them to herself.\n\nShe could have talked to you-- shared that she was feeling left out or replaced, asked to spend more quality time with you, asked for your support. \n\nShe could have plastered on  a smile, been outwardly pleasant, and spent every bridesmaid interaction secretly imagining stabbing Bria in the face like a voodoo doll. \n\nShe could have made an actual voodoo doll. \n\nBut she did none of those things. Instead, she decided to act like a child and cruelly bully someone else to make herself feel better. And now that you've realized it, you've decided that's not the kind of person you want in your life. \n\nNTA and stay classy, OP.", "NTA but if you're that fast to drop friends altogether you probably weren't really their friend lol.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's girl that is a friend not a girlfriend to be jealous of you spending time with other girls. I get that feelings are irrational, but she chose to act on them in a whorst possible way", "NTA - if she\u2019s doing this to push someone away from you I hate to imagine what she might do at your wedding to prove your relationship is strongest", "NTA. This wasn't a her or me situation until Kayla made it one. You didn't want to \"choose\" and, nor should you have had to, but her behaviour is nothing short of mean girl bully. There are consequences to bad behaviour, and this is hers.\n\nI wouldn't want someone near me who would try to alienate people from my life behind my back. I wonder if you have mysteriously had other friendships fall by the way side over the years?", "NTA - I feel like Kayla must be feeding your mutual friends untrue information for them to side with her because any sane kind person would not back a person who unjustly calls another an \"undeserving cow\".\n\nWell, I'm sorry you have to go through this during all of your wedding planning. It's definitely the last thing you need to worry about. It's all unnecessary drama.
