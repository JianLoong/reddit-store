Just one of the reasons you mentioned was enough, but in totality, that dog sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA her dog sounds like a menace . Call her bluff and say ok guess you guys aren\u2019t coming then !", "This is a very simple NTA. As long as you requested the boarding at least a few weeks in advance (since trying to find a sitter/available boarding a week before the biggest holiday of the year, especially for a larger dog, can be a massive, expensive pain), there's no excuse for her to be behaving like this over being asked to do it.  \n\n\nAt this point, if she's refusing to come unless she can bring the dog, tell her that you hope she has a nice Christmas by herself and invite everyone but her to come over. The decision to not board is hers and she has no one to blame but herself if she's stuck at home with the dog over the holidays.", "NTA\n\nHer dog isn't welcome in your home.  That's a reasonable boundary.  And if that means Mom stays home, that's perfectly fine.  It isn't necessary for Mom and Dad to stay at your place overnight for Christmas.", "NTA.  I can't believe your mother would be so inconsiderate to bring a large poorly trained dog to your home with her young grandchildren.", "NTA. I would never risk my kids or dogs for someone else\u2019s dog. They can even have someone come and hang with the dog in their own house (I used to do this when I walked/ dog sat dogs!)", "NTA, I have the same \"problem\" with my friend who has a dog. My dogs don't like him, and he also goes after my cats, bunny, and chickens if he gets the chance. \nShe asked me to lock up the dogs and cats while she is here and also the bunny and chickens who usually roam free, and I refuse to lock up all my animals just for her dog. \n\nSo I completely understand you, the whole energy for your family will be off and you just want to have a nice fun and relaxing Christmas morning.", "NTA you have to put your kids\u2019 safety first. Sounds like mom might have to watch the kids open gifts through FaceTime on a propped up phone.", "NTA. Your home, your rules. I\u2019d call her bluff and stand firm on this if I were in your shoes.", "NTA - She made her choice. Sorry it wasn\u2019t you and your family. Do NOT let that dog in your house. Enjoy the Holiday with people who actually want to be with you.", "NTA. Mom needs to put dog in a kennel, not ruin Christmas. Dog sucks ass and that's on her, not you being pregnant and emotional or any of that BS. Put your foot down sis, don't let the damn dog control your holiday plans!", "NTA your house, your rules.  Your dog comes before a guests, and a badly behaved dog doesn\u2019t need to be around you or your kids.", "NTA - I swear, dog people can be some of the most entitled people in the world.", "Too much hassle. Just enjoy the holiday with your husband and kids. You can go visit them for a couple of hours after the holidays.", "NTA", "NTA.  Unless you say OK, no one should bring their dog to your house, period!   No explanation needed.", "NTA. This is her choice. It\u2019s your home. Not hers. If she wants to spend time there, she can do it without the dog. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here and you didn\u2019t make any choices for her, she is a grown woman who can deal with the consequences of not having a trained dog. Feel free to tell her \u201cyou are still welcome to stay here, but your dog is too much of a disruption to my home, so it would have to be without him. I don\u2019t bring my dog to your home for this exact reason and it is not too much for me to ask for the same consideration. That said, I completely understand if you decide you want to stay with the dog and I can always call you when we get up and give you a half hour\u2019s notice to gift opening if you want to stop by.\u201d And that would be the extent of any compromise I would offer. You are not overreacting and it\u2019s not your job to help your mother out of a situation of her own making. It\u2019s fine to also just say \u201cok!\u201d Because this is something your mom is going to have to deal with and get over.", "NTA.  She apparently doesn't really want to come to your house then.", "NTA", "NTA\nYour mother made the choice ans is trying to blame you for it.  They invited themselves to your home and want to bring a dog that's untrained as well. You are completely right to say no to the dog,  whatever your parents miss out on because of that is their problem not yours. I'm pregnant,  due in a few weeka.  My MIL has a badly behaved dog.  I have informed my partner that of the dog can't behave around baby then we won't be visiting and it's US not MIL who is doing all the research about introductions etc. Protect your kids.", "NTA. WTF is up with your mom. Hold your boundary.", "NTA. I have 3 guesses as to why mom is  insisting on bringing the dog.\n1 Boarding kennels are all booked up\n2 Boarding kennels raise prices for Christmas \n3 She\u2019s worried her dog might catch the new deadly respiratory illness \n4 Her dog can\u2019t be boarded bc he currently has a respiratory \nNone of these are valid reasons for you to allow the dog at your house.  Knocking over your little ones is a hard no.  Smile, tell mom you understand and wish her well.  Don\u2019t be angry and make this an us or the dog OMG mom doesn\u2019t really love us deal.  It isn\u2019t, on that part you are over reacting a little.", "NTA", "NTA  As long as this subject has come up, let her know your home has a dog who knows how to behave around young children, and the holidays are wild enough .  Then fill her in on exactly why:  space too small for a large dog, dog's barking, neighbors' complaints. The dog cannot come.  Period.  And BTW, it is irresponsible of her Not have trained her very large dog to canine good citizen level at a minimum.", "NTA  She doesn't want to come so can now say it's your fault because you didn't let her bring the dog. If she says anything in front of family about it ask each one if she has ever brought dog to their homes. When they say no, ask her why she insists on doing it at yours then.", "Nope.

She is choosing to not come in that case. Why are you then whining about her choosing the dog over your kids? She is only hurting herself by denying herself the joy of Christmas morning.
