She comes over to our house once a week roughly to visit and spend time with us and her granddaughter. But when she visits and holds her, if our daughter starts fussing or crying she hands her back over straight to us and doesn\u2019t seem very confident, and she fed her once (bottle fed) and she didnt really seem like she knew what she was doing (I know this sounds harsh but it\u2019s just how both my Gf and I perceived it) like when she needed to burp she was too scared to pat her back and worried about the baby spitting up on her. My gf\u2019s mom on the other hand is great with feeding her, even better than us sometimes.\n\nMy mom recently spoke to me privately and said she wants to be more involved and she offered to look after her if we ever need help as she\u2019s only a 5 minute drive from our house. \n\nThe problem here is that she has a 10 week old puppy and her house is always a mess and cluttered and she works from home. She is constantly almost tripping and falling over because of her dog and I just keep picturing her walking around holding our daughter and her dog tripping her.\n\nI told her that while we are extremely grateful for the gesture and the help, we just don\u2019t feel comfortable with her looking after her at the moment. I said when she\u2019s a bit older then sure, we\u2019ll talk about it then. I explained to her my concerns about the dog etc and she got upset and asked why my girlfriends mum gets to look after her a lot more than she does, and I said that she\u2019s simply just better with her than you and I don\u2019t mean that in a rude way but it\u2019s the truth\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been feeling awful and while my girlfriend supports me, my girlfriends mom said that we should just be a bit more lenient and let her be more involved.", "created_utc": 1672559679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100euam/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_my_gf_and_i_arent/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How inept can she be? She raised you.", "Nta for a multitude of reasons. \n1. It\u2019s your child. YOUR child. You get to choose who watches her and who doesn\u2019t. \n2. She wants to be more involved but will only help as a baby sitter not like, coming to help you clean is a bit of a red flag to me but that could just be personal trauma. \n3. You said yourself she looked uncomfortable holding feeding and burping her. VERY important part of a 6 week old baby. Why would she WANT to do that if she\u2019s uncomfortable?\n\nYour momma instincts will always be right. Listen to them :)", "NAH. Your worried about your child for the right reasons in this scenario. I understand why your mom is upset, though. I think you guys should talk about it a bit more", "NTA. This isn't about your mom, it's about what's best for the baby. You've seen a few clues that make you uncomfortable leaving them alone so far, so the only responsible thing for you to do is listen to those instincts. \n\nShe may improve with more experience, but that involvement can absolutely happen with you there. Everybody wins.\n\nIt sounds like she's comparing herself to your girlfriend's mom and making it a competition of sorts. That's a bad reason to take an infant. The only way you'd be part AH here is if you're rude about it when you say no, but it sounds like you tried to be tactful.", "Nta because its your child but um...she raised you. Was she a terrible mother?", "NTA but you may have burned a bridge you may need to cross again. I hope your mother in law will be available to you.", "NTA \n\nLook up 4th trimester and bonding.

Perhaps a less hurtful way than MIL is better at it is maybe saying \u201cMiL has had 4 kids and seems more relaxed with baby; you seem anxious and unfortunately babies can pick up on that. If you\u2019d like to spend more time with baby in our home with us to help so that you become more comfortable and confident with her we\u2019d love you to spend time with us\u201d. (when convenient for the new parents of course). If she takes you up on it great; if not you tried.", "NTA. My own mother would cry and complain that my infant son was allowed to have sleepovers at my MIL\u2019s house back when we were first starting out and I had to work mornings. I held my ground though. MIL\u2019s house was always cleaner and had an alarm and security. My own mother smoked and left her windows and doors open all the time and she lived at the beach. Our babies are our lives, and everyone else can deal.", "This is a good idea.", "OP is the dad btw but yeah, his baby", "OOOOP my bad. NYE got me tipsy. Your DADDY instincts will be right too. Don\u2019t worry", "So the situation will not change when your kid is older. House will still be a mess and dog will be bigger. She can babysit at your home. Which is actually easier than moving stuff especially if she\u2019s like 5 minutes away. You seem to have survived into adulthood with her as your mother. So have her come over and do some short trips at first, grocery shopping a movie. Your kid your choice but give it a go.", "NTA. I have a 2yo and I still wouldn\u2019t be comfortable letting my mother in law watch him but I am comfortable letting my own mother watch him. Mostly it\u2019s a difference in parenting style, her attentiveness, and that she is a chain smoker. Additionally I\u2019ve just sort of had a strained relationship with her in the past so I just don\u2019t really want her unattended with my son.", "NTA - but I also remember my dad being a little skiddish at first and nervous and not wanting to hold his granddaughter a ton when she was VERY little. Then she would only ever stop crying with him \ud83e\udd23 Maybe start out having your Mom over to watch the baby while you guys are there so you can take a nap. Then if anything nY really pops up you\u2019re still around for her to ask.\n\nThat way you can all start to feel more comfortable", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You have sole discretion over who is around your kids. \n\nYour mother has raised kid/s though, I assume. I do suspect from reading this that your mother\u2019s nervousness is due more to fearing criticism from you and your GF than lack of skill.", "You'd be surprised. My mom forgot that babies fuss and thinks that means they don't like you. She won't rock them or anything.  Also she didn't take care of herself and things babies get really heavy around 2 months. Also growing up she had anger problem. I sure as helm don't let her babysit.", "Who's to say she wasn't inept then? Just because OP survived doesn't mean she did a good job at least at the infant stage.", "Oh for sure. I just meant that\u2019s probably her thought process. It wasn\u2019t clear in my comment though, I\u2019ll take that L.", "How was your childhood? Was it bad, was she abusive? Either way your kid so your choice and of course your GF agrees her mom gets the alone time with her mom lol.", "NTA. Mom raised she's not a spring chicken anymore.", "You could try having her come to your home while you nap or take a shower.  You are in your own space & your mom can get used to being with the baby. Edit: typo", "NTA If she's not confident with the baby it's not safe. Add the puppy and what you described and that would be a H\u00a3\u03c0 NO! It's not about her feelings. it's about what keeps your child safe. That situation is a disaster waiting to happen.", "Nta, some grandparents are more involved after what i call the potato stage. Where they can do more than eat, sleep and poop. \n\nYou can choose to and reassure your mom than its okay this stage isnt really for her. For your baby gonna get bigger and she can be more involved in way she will be more comfortable with. You love that she wants to be more involved. Just give it some time.", "Oh dude. That's what my.mother in law is like.  Unfortunately, if you're taking care of a kid under (I don't even know how old but our oldest is 3.5 and it's still true) a certain age, you have to be 100% in it to win it.  You can be taught how to bottle feed, that you can't fault someone for being bad at. But if you aren't gonna deal with fusiness!?", "My daughter is only four and I feel like I've forgotten everything I learned. Plus she was a really chill baby and easy to calm so I never really had to develop the skills needed to handle a very fussy or sick baby."]}
