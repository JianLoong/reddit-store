She mentioned that we need to buckle down and get serious about her weight. I told her I was not in the mood for this.\n\nShe gets in close to me and whispers that Madelyn basically admitted to becoming too fat for gym and out of shape and asked me why I was okay with it. I told her again I wasn't in the mood for this talk. She asked if I'll be in the mood when Madelyn's 250 pounds as a senior and can't fit in the desk. I said that won't happen. She said I can't guarantee that. I told her to just stay out of this as it was a family issue.

To me her language suggests putting the kid on some sort of restricted diet based on her own non-expert ideas, which are usually not the best way to achieve lasting weight loss.

This is not something that you should be whispering about and plotting against your daughter over.

So in my eyes she\u2019s doing a lot. \n\nFor her, though I think she should\u2019ve dropped the issue when you said you weren\u2019t in the position to talk about it, she seems to care for your daughter. She let you know something her daughter confided in her and may have solution. When you are up to it, just hear her out and then make a decision on what steps to take. \n\nYou are ultimately her father.

The weight-shaming in this reddit aside, you alienated your girlfriend from \"the family\", making sure she knew she wasn't part of it with one single sentence.\n\nBoth of you suck for dogging on a child because of her weight.  I'll give GF some points for waiting until daughter was out of the room, but I bet if you ask your child, she'll tell you that still feels like you're making fun of her weight behind her back.  I'm sure she gets enough of that at school from the Petty Betties.\n\nIf you're honestly concerned about her actual health, talk to the doctor.

She was bringing this up, so at the very least, she was inviting feedback. 2) GF is an asshole for the way she leapt straight to \"fixing\" your daughter, but you were not helpful by saying that you weren't in the mood for this conversation. AGAIN, your daughter brought this up. She is in the mood, so you should be too. 3) You were an asshole when you shot down her concern by saying it was a family issue.

He's definitely the asshole here.\n\nSorry, but outside some relatively rare thyroid disorders, an obese child is 100% the parent's fault. And it's unfortunate but us Americans have a very relaxed (and incorrect) attitude towards childhood obesity. I remember reading some research into obesity a few years ago: Prior to, and during, puberty the body sets the \"preferred size\" for fat cells in your body based on what they currently are. Because of this, if a kid is fit/lean, then their fat cells are smaller and more easily broken down during exercise. If the kid is overweight, they tend to be larger and it takes more energy (exercise) to break them down and lose weight. This change is permanent for the rest of your life. \n\nThe article essentially said that if you're overweight as a kid, it will be harder to lose 100 pounds compared to some one who was fit as a child and then gained 100lbs in adulthood. Idk if this has since been debunked or not, but it does paint an image that keeping your child at a healthy weight is important for their life-long health and expectancy. \n\nOP is letting his pride get in the way of a woman who loves him AND his child.", "Saying repeatedly that you\u2019re \u201cnot in the mood\u201d to discuss something important is also kind of messed up.

Find her a dietician, nutritionist, or weight-loss doctor. Do it now.", "So that\u2019s TWO women you don\u2019t care for as much as you profess. YTA.", "I agree that OP is TAH, but want to add that the daughter doesn't just need help with the physical aspects of her weight. She needs emotional support and validation. She doesn't need to be bullied at home about her weight, but supported and helped. This means being able to hold two things as true: weight loss and health are not easy, and they are also very important. She needs her parents (and parent's GF) to agree with her that bullying from people about her weight is not okay, it's hard to cope with, and it's not helpful. This can help heal some of those psychic wounds that contribute to overeating. As her parent, her emotional and physical wellbeing is OP's responsibility. As her parent's partner, it's the GF's responsibility to bring it to OP.\n\nSo to OP: You have a few things to do here.\n\n1. Take your daughter to the doctor for some testing. She needs to have her A1c tested, her thyroid tested, and she needs to be screened for depression and asthma, along with whatever else the doctor recommends. Push for these as the bare minimum. Do not let them brush you off with a simple 'diet and exercise' prescription, because if it were that easy for her, she wouldn't be fat at this young of an age. You are doing this to identify or rule out anything serious before it becomes worse.\n2. Look into therapy or support groups for her so that she has an outlet for the emotional aspects of this. Weight loss is a process, and it'll unearth a lot of feelings that need to be channeled somewhere besides overeating. It's your job to help her find that outlet. One piece of this is talking to her openly and honestly, and validating her frustrations while also encouraging her.\n3. Don't micromanage her diet, but do help model healthy habits. Make them as fun as possible. Take walks after dinner as a family, increase your vegetable intake, get her involved in food preparation, find her nutrition resources (like a nutritionist, or a non-crash-diet print resource), and help her find movement that she enjoys.\n\nUltimately remember, there isn't a healthy quick fix here. Help her find healthy habits and her weight will correct itself over time. Focus your encouragement on the healthy habits that she is doing and not on the number on the scale. This will help her achieve a healthier weight while also avoiding having her develop an eating disorder. \n\nYour goal here is long-term health, not short-term weight loss.", "As someone that knows a family member who has had a friend for over ten years and that I also know\u2026.\n\nYeah these fucking idiots do exist and will always presume you are not family irrespective of the time and quality of time they spent within family.\n\nWhen that subject was broached a few years ago I looked my family dead in the eyes and then to their friend and told them, \u201cIrrespective of what happens between the two of you, you are always welcome and part of the family.\u201d\n\nSomeone was absolutely pissed, but I told them, the partner was nicer than the family member and always welcome.\n\nIn regard to this post, yeah OP sounds like he gets to make the final decision, irrespective of what the other people actually have grown into.\n\nSad to see that people like this still have such strong main character syndrome", "Yeah depending on how this plays out, I expect the gf to reevaluate their relationship and ask where \"he\" sees it going now.

There are some drugs that can stop the weight gain in some people, but that is about it. The last good science I read of the subject, they think PCOS originates in utero. A particular hormone is released and the baby if female now is at a much greater chance of developing PCOS. \n\nThere is also Lipedema, which doctors understand even less than they understand PCOS. Which also causes the body to put on weight. There seems to be a genetic link to that as well. (Although they used to think that about PCOS so who knows if it is actually genetic or some other reason it runs in families)\n\nThere is a fair amount of evidence coming out that being overweight is often a symptom of underlying health issues, not the cause. But there is such a huge fat bias that permeates society and sadly especially medicine that doctors are very resistant to looking at weight objectively. But to your point, weight gain is and should be treated as a medical condition not a moral failing or indulgence/lack of impulse control.", "Most of the comments are women who are shorter and heavier saying \"oh it's really not that bad, she's not that heavy, people carry weight differently\"\n\nI'm a good 10 inches taller than these women, am the same weight or mostly lighter than they are and I'm still overweight and need to lose weight.", "The study about cell size is interesting, but there's definitely some nature/nurture there too.  \n\nI've noticed that most people in my social circle who are still fit nearing their 40s, all did sports or gym in their youth.  So they already have healthy habits to maintain their weight.  Or, if they happen to have gained weight, it's easier to lose it because we can just \"bounce back\" to how we used to be.

It was always about assessments and running, never about fun and learning how our bodies worked.", "Yes, reading these comments reminds me how much fatphobia there is, and how little people are educated on the realities. Your weight is not the same as your health/fitness! It certainly can be correlated, but isn't necessarily.", "I couldn\u2019t manage gym class at that age and weight.

Weight/ability is not the only factor there", "I don't disagree that she is likely overweight, was just adding that she may actually be even heavier than OP realized because I would have no issue in gym class. I work out most days and commute on a bike.\n\nWeight for cis men and cis women is not the same, though, just to be clear. Cis women's bodies are different and often retain more weight because evolutionarily many of our bodies are designed for eventual childbirth. Wider hips, more body fat, larger chest, menstruation, hormonal fluctuations. It's not universal, but you can't completely compare the two.\n\nThe issue really is that OP's daughter is possibly sedentary and likely not flexible and stiff. She also may have something undiagnosed like exercise induced asthma or hormonal imbalance that makes it harder to breathe or more exhausting when exercising. I didn't realize I had this for decades.\n\nShe may just be bullied or not like her teacher or be body self-conscious despite technically being able to do the activities. She may also just not enjoy it. Not everyone likes exercise.

So I can still have whatever I want, but only 10% of it instead of 100%. It helps scratch the itch while reducing carb intake (and calories, since that's really all I've got to measure). I've definitely gotten away from a ton of carbs (especially in the AM; you're hungry again after an hour or two) and have been making some choices that take my physical ailments into account (for example - cardio is touted as the best thing ever but it can actually make my issues worse - so strength training is better long-term).

He could have easily told his girlfriend that she may have a point and he'll seek medical care and then bring her into it if he thinks she's overstepping. \n\nI'm not sure if he's accurate with her height/weight scale, so it's best if he starts with professional advice.

A large part of losing weight is muscle density. In order to support more muscle mass, our resting metabolic rate is higher. So simply by HAVING muscle, you burn more calories sitting in a chair. There's evidence of an amount of \"muscle memory\" and that once-large muscles can regain their size more easily than when they were first built (for example, a strong person losing muscle due to a long post-injury recovery will build the mass faster than some one who just started working out).
