Well ten minutes later we hear pounding on our door. My husband opens it to our neighbor screaming at him for \u201cpoisoning\u201d her daughter he was very taken back she screamed her daughter has a tree nut allergy and our cookies caused her to have a bad enough reaction to where they needed to use an epipen and after the explicits and yelling about how terrible we are she said leave her and her family alone. \n\nNow I feel awful, I know allergies are very serious and I do have Enjoy Life(allergy free) chocolate chips for when I make cookies for friends I know have allergies. I just feel so guilty for not taking the precautions or even thinking about it. I want  to apologize, but my husband says she is in the wrong she should\u2019ve just thrown the cookies away since her child has an allergy and she knows this not us and told us later about her daughter\u2019s allergy. Her daughter is what seems to be 10-12 years old and he said even the daughter should know better than just to take food from strangers. He said this whole thing was her fault not ours. \n\nAny way AITA?\n\nEdit: I did not add nuts to the cookies they are just standard chocolate chip cookies", "created_utc": 1688484881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qifka/aita_for_taking_cookies_to_our_new_neighbors/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That should be standard question from a parent with a kid with that severe of an allergy. NTA. You can't read minds and you were trying to do something nice.", "NTA. They should have asked if there were any allergens instead of blindly eating the cookies.", "So they took the cookies from you and didnt even ask you if they contained nuts? And let their allergic daughter eat one and then came round to scream at you. NTA, these people are idiots.", "NTA. Found the problematic neighbors. Mines nicknamed crazy Cathy.", "NTA if you have a nut allergy, you make it clear and you ask before you put something in your mouth. It's common sense. I'm allergic to mushrooms and it rarely comes up but I still ask and make everyone aware that I have it when food is involved.", "NTA - The parents failed this child by allowing her to eat cookies without verifying 100% of the ingredients. It was incredibly irresponsible of them to not mention her allergy to you and ask if there is anything in there that could harm her and even then I probably still wouldn't chance it. They have to teach their daughter that she can't depend on others to assume she might have an allergy. Her life is going to depend on her own vigilance, and they are doing her a disservice by not instilling that in her.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not responsible for her allergy or how her family deals with it.\n\nFeel guilty if you like, it was in no way your fault.", "NTA. They should've never taken the cookies without asking if they contained the ingredient their daughter is allergic to. Their daughter is old enough to know not to eat food she isn't sure whether contains her allergen, but since her parents were present this is mostly on them. They've had an allergic child for over a decade, they should know how to handle food around her by now.", "NTA. You had no idea she has allergies. The parents are the aholes though.", "NTA but honestly, with so many people being anaphylaxis to nuts, I would never give something to people I didn't know without attaching a note indicating it contained nuts.\n\nBad on the parents for not checking with you first and bad on them for freaking out on you.  All they had to do was let you know that their daughter is highly allergic and had a very bad reaction to your cookies.\n\nFor the future avoid gifting home baking that contains peanuts or nuts unless you know for sure the recipients don't have allergies.\n\nSource: live with someone who is deathly allergic to tree nuts and fin fish.", "NTA. They should have asked about the ingredients or simply thanked you and not given them to their kid.\n\nYour gesture was very kind and I love when my neighbors have made a similar efforts to be friendly.", "NTA. I feel bad for the kid but if someone has a food allergy, they shouldn't be eating food from strangers, or at the least they should be asking about the ingredients. The responsibility is always on the person with the allergy (or their parents, in this case, I can't fault a child for eating something their parents presumably said was okay).\n\nI do think it was a nice gesture but this is why if someone showed up at my front doorstep with homemade baked goods, I wouldn't eat them. I don't know what's in them, I don't know how clean the kitchen they were baked in was. But I would politely take them and say thank you, I appreciate it, and then binned them.", "NTA. Do they even like their child? If I had a child with a potentially deadly allergy, I wouldn't let them have a cookie until I could ascertain the ingredients used. OP, you had no way to know this child had an allergy.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnyone who has a food allergy knows better than to eat something without all the ingredients being listed.  It is her own fault if she allowed her daughter to eat unidentified food.", "NTA. You gave the cookies to the neighbour, it was incumbent on them to make sure it was safe for their kid. Did they ask if it contained nuts? Did they tell you their kid had a nut allergy?", "NTA...and I say this as a parent to a kid with multiple food allergies. By the time my kid was 3, kiddo would ask about potential allergens before eating *anything,* even things I made. Even today, decades later, I'll still get the \"is it safe?\" before they randomly grab a baked good in my house. This is 100% on that child and those parents, **NOT** on you.", "NAH:  I think you should have told them there was nuts in it since typically chocolate chip cookies don't contain nuts. But they should have asked.", "YTA, a tiny bit. You wouldn't expect chocolate chip cookies to have nuts in unless told so. And when making things for others you don't know you always add a note with potential/included allergens.", "Soft YTA - you\u2019re meeting people for the first time and have no idea what their allergies are.

It's expected that anybody with significant allergies will speak up and ask if there are nuts in the cookies. Nuts are relatively common in cookies. \n\nNTA", "I thought it was a pretty standard risk with chocolate chip cookies and some other flavors that someone might have used nuts or had it come into contact with nuts so people with nut allergies are typically more careful about it. I\u2019m surprised she just ate it without asking. NTA I don\u2019t think this is about you using non-mainstream brands/ingredients. This is them being careless.", "NTA. I would never put nuts in anything I was taking to a neighbor, but that's because I have people in my family with severe peanut allergies. On the other hand, people in my family never assume that a proffered baked good is safe for those with allergies, and why your neighbor would do that escapes me. She should have asked you what ingredients you used, or even fronted with, \"thank you but we have serious allergies in our home so can't accept these.\" No reason to go off on you like that\u2014the mistake was innocent.", "Aren't allergy kids and their parents supposed to be careful about what the kids eat?\n\nApparently, these \\[parents aren't, and that kid is in danger of dying eventually if she consumes anything presented to her. Tree nuts can turn up in anything, especially cookies.\n\nNTA, and avoid having any dealings with these people from now on.", "NTA\n\nI have dietary restrictions and would never accept food that I don\u2019t know the contents of. I would either politely explain and decline or regift, depending on the situation. \n\nFor this reason, I do generally list ingredients or at least allergens and strive to minimize allergens. But sensitivities and preferences are complicated and I also know I can\u2019t please everyone. I also don\u2019t expect this from others, since most people don\u2019t have to think about what they eat as much as I do. \n\nThis kid is old enough to know they can\u2019t have certain things. This is not a you problem.", "NTA as someone with a nut allergy imo it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure the food is safe for their daughter. I never eat anything without checking even if it\u2019s a type of food that\u2019s usually safe because there\u2019s always the chance that it could cause a reaction.", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished.", "They didn\u2019t. They just said \u201cthank you\u201d \u201cnice to meet you\u201d and \u201cwelcome to the neighborhood\u201d", "This x1000 times. This is on the parents of the child who should have asked. NTA", "It is on the parents though, not the OP.  Lots of people use nuts in cookies.    \nWhen someone has a food allergy, it is the person who has the allergy to exercise caution, or their parent.  \n\nSource: parent of food allergic daughter.  Allergies to soy, rice, peanut, tree nut, and lots more.  It was MY job to police food for my child, not someone else\u2019s.  Been this way for decades.  That child is now in their 30th year and still knows it is HER job to remain vigilant against allergens.", "My friend is also terribly allergic not deathly, but I\u2019ve seen her have a reaction and it is very traumatizing. I think that\u2019s why I feel so guilty because I do have another opinion because of my friend and I didn\u2019t think about it.", "She did not. Just the typical first time meeting conversation took place. We had no idea until she came over and yelled at us.", "People with nut allergies have to be extremely careful and should read the label of everything they eat every single time they eat it because ingredients in products can change. The parents were negligent for not even caring enough to mention she had a food allergy to OP and for allowing their daughter to eat a non-labeled food product in general. They aren't teaching her the tools she is going to need to stay alive when she is on her own in this world.", "People with food allergies are taught to assume everything has their allergen unless proven otherwise.  \n\nMost chocolate chips are labeled as being produced in a facility that processes nuts.    \nMany people put nuts in chocolate chip cookies.  \n\nThis is entirely on the parents not the OP.", "Then they suck ass as parents and it's their fault their kid had the reaction. I mean I get mistakes happen, but they can't expect the rest of the world to just never use nuts in any form of baking or cooking ever again because their child has an allergy and they don't know how to ask people about ingredients", "Did you give the cookie directly to the child, bypassing the parents? That's the only way you'd be wrong IMHO.", "I hear you. Also found out that sometimes a little kid will have a first reaction to something like peanuts\u2014parents never saw them react and suddenly they go into anaphylactic shock. It's just easier on me if I don't put peanuts in anything to be shared with folks I do not know really well.", "There aren't labels on homemade food....", "Indeed. How hard can it be to ask \"I'm sorry, but do the cookies have nuts in it? Oh, they do? Well then, I appreciate the gesture but I must decline bc my daughter is allergic. Thank you anyway.\"", "Yeah, no kidding. People with severe allergies shouldn't risk eating anything that isn't clearly labelled. They allowed her to eat food from literal strangers and they were negligent for doing that. Some people with nut allergies even bring their own food to events like weddings and parties just to be on the safe side. Some are so severe that they have a reaction even if food is cooked near anything with nuts so they don't even risk eating at restaurants. It sucks, but that's life with a nut allergy, and it's on the person to be their own advocate to remain safe in this world.", "I mean in my original comment I did say they should have asked first....so we're in agreement"]}
