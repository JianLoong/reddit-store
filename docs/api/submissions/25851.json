You also don't mention whether she was going to increase your compensation - I know you like spending time with your niece and nephew, but six kids at once, 2/3 of whom aren't yours, is a significant increase in your labour over four kids, half of whom are yours. \n\nBy numbers alone NTA.

It's family so that didn't matter and you both know that. She's entitled in a toxic way. You can't just force kids together and expect them to start to be friends and get along and it's VERY MUCH not your job to facilitate this. They're passing their responsibilities onto you and honestly they should be watching the kids themselves and supervising the initial bonding phases so there's no hiccups and they can at least start off as friendly. Expecting them to immediately act as siblings is way too much to ask of anyone and she's asking it of EVERYONE. NTA", "NTA. You sister isn\u2019t thinking what\u2019s best for the kids, she\u2019s hoping you do the heavy lifting of integrating the kids. You have no idea what they are like.

Honestly, I hope the kids are good about everything, or your sister\u2019s new relationship will be very, very difficult if this is how she deals with things.", "NTA. Clearly your sister has taken advantage of you for some time now. You are saving her a fortune by caring for her kids rather than having them in daycare. I\u2019m astounded by her assumption that you\u2019d automatically take on two more kids. Her response to your perfectly reasonable request is quite shocking. It really shows her character. Personally, I\u2019d let her 4 children get to bond together at some other babysitter or daycare. You can enjoy some quality time with your two children without the stress of having to care for 6 children. I really hope you stand your ground and not get pressured into caring for half a dozen kids. Good Luck!", "NTA but the main problem is not that you won't have met the children, it's that you are paid peanuts to look after 2 children and now you would have to look after 4 (6 including your own) for, I assume, not much more money because faaaaamilyyyyyy.\n\nYou are already being exploited, and quite frankly your sister is a gigantic AH to her own children.

You're looking out for the safety of all those involved. You don't want to jump in headfirst and be the person dealing with all the sibling disputes, without knowing how people behave. What she doesn't realise is that throwing everyone in the deep end and enforcing a blended family dynamic from day dot will backfire as everyone will feel pressured to act a certain way and resent being punished for not feeling the way she wants them to.", "NTA.  Your sister is being an AH.  You're doing a huge favor (paid or not) by watching her kids along with your two.  Four kids is a lot.  Expecting you to add two more kids to the mix that you don't even know is an AH move.  The blended family is HER family - not your problem.

She was totally disregarding your needs when she mandated you take all the kids after school immediately. 6 kids is too many anyway.", "NTA\n\nYour headline made you sound like an asshole, but you're making a perfectly reasonable request. It makes sense that you would want to get to know 2 additional children you would be taking care of regardless of the degree of relation.", "NTA. You were not a babysitter/nanny for your niece and nepher and you know them and they know you since they were very little, so they listen to you, take directions from you, etc. With children that don't know you, haven't met you, you can expect a lot of difficulties until this sort of relationship is built - and you are not taking care just of her kids, you have your own to look after. 2 small children (your own) + your older niece and nephew that you have a relationship with might not have been that much extra energy and burden, but two unknown kids - definitely you made the right choice raising the issue. \n\nYou sister is asking you to embrace a big change, but it is her that is making a blended family, not you. So she is not entitled to your unconditional childcare help.", "NTA.\n\nIf she's not introducing you to them, at least by Skype / FaceTime, I see it as her KNOWING the kids are brats, but her wanting the new sex buddy and not letting a little thing like YOUR unhappiness get in her way.", "NTA - Your sister is DELUSIONAL. She has no idea how her kids and her step kids are going to adjust to the change of their parents being married and all of them living together. So aside from you not knowing the step kids at all, you have no idea what the dynamic between all of the kids is going to look like - and since your kids will also be in the mix, that has the potential to significantly negatively impact them as well. What she is suggesting is a HORRIBLE idea. \n\nShe is twisting the idea of treating her step kids equally into a pretzel. Expecting you to get all the kids similar things for holiday presents? Absolutely! Expecting you to pretend like this isn't a massive adjustment for everybody and a significant amount of extra work for you? Absurd.", "NTA", "NTA.

You were watching her two kids for a small amount of money, but now she is changing the agreement. If you DO consider watching the new kids, make sure she increases the amount of money she is paying you.

Also, have you tried asking her why exactly she can\u2019t let you meet the kids first? Something smells funny about that. Sure she\u2019s getting married, she\u2019s busy, and they\u2019re out of state, but she might be hiding something, too. Does one or both of the future husband\u2019s kids have difficult or extra care requirements? I\u2019m getting a big feeling she\u2019s tryjng to push you into agreeing so it\u2019s harder for you to back out once you find out whatever she\u2019d hiding from you. \n\nWhat I\u2019m guessing is one or both kids have big behavioral problems, or big care needs that are demanding. Medical conditions, developmental problems, etc. Stuff like that can be really demanding and rough, and entitled people all follow the same trickster pattern when they intentionally conceal this and try to force someone to agree to dealing with it in advance, so if that person later tries to back out, they can play the \u201cbut you already agreed!\u201d card. If this happens, try and remember no matter what tricks she falls back on that she tried to manipulate you.

Unless they met, \"dated\" a few times and leapt straight to a marriage proposal.", "I think your sister is hoping that you'll do all the heavy lifting when it comes to making them get along, to avoid them thinking of her as the evil stepmother who makes them be polite, and share, and all the stuff that ends up a point of contention when new stepsiblings enter the picture. I'm a stepsister myself and getting \"new siblings\" is hard on kids, and she likely wants you to be at the front lines of the arguments so she doesn't have to be. It might be worth telling her that it's better for them to establish a relationship with her first, because \"new aunt\" will have no authority if new stepmother doesn't have it first.", "My dad won\u2019t even adopt a dog until he sees how it gets along with his other animals. Your sister is taking \u201call kids the same\u201d too far. I wonder how the kids feel about this?", "OP\n1. Do not agree to your sister's unreasonable demand.

You might have to keep an eye out for some bad signs for the sake of your niece and nephew.\n\nYour sister is sounding like the mom/stepmom in a story of a kid that has been abused or neglected or generally forced into bad or fake family dynamics because the parents of the new blended family severely fucked up the blending. It makes no sense to try to establish the slightest hint of a relationship before you move in with someone. People have roommate interviews but new step siblings can't meet?\n\nWhether there is something weird going on that led to that decision or they're just dumb for thinking this is the ideal way to do this, you may never know and probably can't do anything about it. You can keep an eye on your niblings and make sure they are ok through this shit show of blending of families. Any extra pair of eyes on the situation can help and I would pay attention to the step kids as well.

Is this an arranged marriage of some sort ?\n\nIt's really off that the kids will get their first contact together at the aunt's place like that instead of in their home where your sister wants to form her perfect blended family dream.

If the two halves have never even met let alone spend time together for a period prior to getting engaged, this \"blending\" is gonna be messy as hell.

How long was she even dating this guy?", "This is not going to end well. This is a HUGE change for the kid and they're giving them zero time to acclimate and insisting on playing immediate happy family. It's a recipe for disaster. \n\nDoes SHE even know her own fianc\u00e9 that well?  Like has she spent much time in person with him? Something feels WAY off about this.\n\nYou are NTA and I hope your sister knows what she's doing, for her kids' sake, but I suspect she does not. It honestly scares me that she's moving a man into her home with her kids who's never met them.", "This marriage won't last. Just ride this out and tell her she is asking WAY too much of you and her relationship is ridiculous. Don't let her use you.", "Plus you have your own two kids at the same time so you can\u2019t focus just on introducing the kids", "And your sister is wanting you to do the blending.

I smell forced relationships turned resentful kids on both sides. \n\nIt's fine to treat everyone equally from the start but that's on the topic of buying things like necessities and luxuries.

They moved us all in together after meeting once for like 5 minutes (into ONE bedroom. For 4 girls, 3 of which were teens and one a 5 year old. And before that I was an only child, and they moved into my room jamming more beds in). Then, they left for vacation and told everyone I was in charge. Worst mistake ever\n\nBefore I moved out I had a list of trauma caused by them, from being randomly pushed down the stairs to them trying to sneak my deadly allergies into my food, or even coating my toothbrush in a chemical I was allergic to. I agree, this is definitely a recipe for disaster. The parents are prioritizing themselves so much that everyone will suffer in the long run", "Ah no...time to end regular childcare (yours plus hers plus theirs is too much). Sis is an AH. \"Blended\" is not the issue. She's selfish & inconsiderate to ask you to take on 4 kids (plus yours) regardless of whether or not they're angels.

But it could \"just\" be that they can't/don't want to pay for childcare for that many kids.", "Does it have to be malicious?

The weirdness has to be coming from the soon-to-be step dad's side.", "There is a 2000% chance these new kids will have behavioral problems if they don't already.

Is this an arranged marriage? Such a rushed affair.\nEdit, spelling", "This. Before we physically met our [adopted] son he saw photos of his new parents and home and bedroom and school and grandparents. Then we met him at his Foster families home for 40 minutes to say hi.
