Yours because now there are 4 extra kids around every day, her kids are already going to be on edge because they are now doubling the size of their family.

Heck the kids may be misbehaved brats and who wants that.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a \"my way or the highway\" person. The only way to reeducate those type of people is to show them the highway. Reiterate your stance, don't play her strawman games. You might want to get in front of the inevitable lies she'll tell family by proactively telling family members what really happened - don't ask them for advice, tell them what went down.", "NTA - your sister has clearly put zero thought into this! \"Treat them the same\" is a bad idea. The step-kids are moving to a new state, a new school, a new home and will absolutely need time, space, and yes special treatment to be settle in with any level of success.\n\nDumping her new step-kids into her kids current routine and expecting that to work perfectly at the snap of fingers is a laughably bad idea.", "NTA. \n\nEven if you knew the kids, 6 kids with one caregiver is not a safe ratio, in my opinion. Do not say yes. You'll quickly find that it's too much to handle and when you have to drop them, everyone will give you so much shit for it. \n\nStop being nice and think of your kids. You owe them more than 1/3 of your attention.", "NTA you asked to meet them atleast twice before? That is like nothing I know some pre-schools in Sweden that expect parents to be a part of the process for like 1 week before handing the child into their care.", "Bonding not blood. Your sister is a bully. NTA", "NTA\n\nI've often found that the word 'just' is a way to convince you to do something you don't want to do.\n\n*'Can you just?'*\n\n*'Oh, it's just ...'*\n\nIt tends to go along with the phrase *'it'll be fine'*, usually without any evidence to show how things will be fine.\n\nTo get back to your question, your boundaries are absolutely reasonable. If anything, it shows how much you take the responsibility of care seriously, as opposed to just being convenient.\n\nStick to your guns, and I hope your sister realises that you've got her stepchildren's interests at heart.", "She's going from doubling the number of children you care for to tripling that number. Your children will now be outnumbered 2:1 instead of in a 1:1 situation. Oh course you should be able to meet the new kids first to make sure the new group dynamic would be acceptable! You also don't mention whether she was going to increase your compensation - I know you like spending time with your niece and nephew, but six kids at once, 2/3 of whom aren't yours, is a significant increase in your labour over four kids, half of whom are yours. \n\nBy numbers alone NTA. Your sister sounds like she's going to be one of those types that will ignore common sense and fairness in managing her blended family, and create additional conflict as a result.", "NTA and I bet these new kids are horrible and that's why she doesn't want you to meet them.", "NTA - your sister sure sounds entiteld. If she keeps this Shit 'we start as a big Family' up the Kids will all hate each other. You often read on Reddit how parents marry and expect the Kids to be like siblings from day one. All of them ended up hating each other and the parents", "There are two types of babysitting. There is an I like these kids, they feel like family in my home babysitting. Usually done for free or little cost. Usually because you like the kids so it doesn't feel like work.\n\nThen there is babysitting for money. When you take in random kids you don't know well or get paid a real wage to watch. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being ok doing 1 and not the other. Family is not made by blood or a sheet of paper. It's made by familiarity and love. Things that develop over time. Your sister is just being a spoiled brat and wants cheap childcare.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s wants are unreasonable and her guilting you is inexcusable.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is being ridiculous - accusing you of only considering those who are related by blood to be family? Right now you are not a blood relative, true, and you are also not a legal relative. More importantly, right now you are a complete stranger to them (and them to you). Who would throw children into that situation?\n\nOn top of that, going from caring for four children (all of whom you know well) to six is a HUGE ask of anyone. \n\nYou've given two very reasonable options, you should stand firm with those.", "6 kids - 2 will be in a strange house surrounded by strangers?

I\u2019m betting the kids are major brats and she knows if you see this in advance you won\u2019t agree she thinks if she can get them in and you agree to it you wouldn\u2019t be able to back out. Your the one doing her the favour she doesn\u2019t get to dictate terms to you so no NTA.", "NTA. If your sister insists on treating all the children the same you could just refuse to watch her bios and soon to be steps. So your sister can\u2019t complain you\u2019re treating blood relatives differently.", "NTA. First it's not your job to play babysitter even if she's paying you. It's family so that didn't matter and you both know that. She's entitled in a toxic way. You can't just force kids together and expect them to start to be friends and get along and it's VERY MUCH not your job to facilitate this. They're passing their responsibilities onto you and honestly they should be watching the kids themselves and supervising the initial bonding phases so there's no hiccups and they can at least start off as friendly. Expecting them to immediately act as siblings is way too much to ask of anyone and she's asking it of EVERYONE. NTA", "NTA. You sister isn\u2019t thinking what\u2019s best for the kids, she\u2019s hoping you do the heavy lifting of integrating the kids. You have no idea what they are like. How they feel about the situation. Honestly, I hope the kids are good about everything, or your sister\u2019s new relationship will be very, very difficult if this is how she deals with things.", "NTA. Clearly your sister has taken advantage of you for some time now. You are saving her a fortune by caring for her kids rather than having them in daycare. I\u2019m astounded by her assumption that you\u2019d automatically take on two more kids. Her response to your perfectly reasonable request is quite shocking. It really shows her character. Personally, I\u2019d let her 4 children get to bond together at some other babysitter or daycare. You can enjoy some quality time with your two children without the stress of having to care for 6 children. I really hope you stand your ground and not get pressured into caring for half a dozen kids. Good Luck!", "NTA but the main problem is not that you won't have met the children, it's that you are paid peanuts to look after 2 children and now you would have to look after 4 (6 including your own) for, I assume, not much more money because faaaaamilyyyyyy.\n\nYou are already being exploited, and quite frankly your sister is a gigantic AH to her own children. She'll be on here in a year wondering why the kids hate each other and her/her new husband, when she is the one pushing an enormous chnage on young children with no time to adapt. \n\nYou are very wise to not want to step into a messy situation like that.", "NTA. You're looking out for the safety of all those involved. You don't want to jump in headfirst and be the person dealing with all the sibling disputes, without knowing how people behave. What she doesn't realise is that throwing everyone in the deep end and enforcing a blended family dynamic from day dot will backfire as everyone will feel pressured to act a certain way and resent being punished for not feeling the way she wants them to.", "NTA.  Your sister is being an AH.  You're doing a huge favor (paid or not) by watching her kids along with your two.  Four kids is a lot.  Expecting you to add two more kids to the mix that you don't even know is an AH move.  The blended family is HER family - not your problem.   You shouldn't have to \"throw\" yourself into her big change.  She's making her kids your problem.  Nope.", "NTA. Your sister is living in a Brady Bunch fantasy. (Don't worry, she'll be back down to earth soon, and I'm sure it will be a bumpy landing.) She thinks that if she PRETENDS everything is cool and normal, everything will be. You are not looking at the situation with the same rose-colored glasses.\n\nInterested to know how old the stepkids are ... because that's going to affect the dynamic of how they get along with their new stepsibs as well as your kids. (FWIW, I wouldn't trust strange kids just descending on my 5 and 1 year olds either.)", "NTA. She was totally disregarding your needs when she mandated you take all the kids after school immediately. 6 kids is too many anyway.", "NTA\n\nYour headline made you sound like an asshole, but you're making a perfectly reasonable request. It makes sense that you would want to get to know 2 additional children you would be taking care of regardless of the degree of relation.", "NTA. You were not a babysitter/nanny for your niece and nepher and you know them and they know you since they were very little, so they listen to you, take directions from you, etc. With children that don't know you, haven't met you, you can expect a lot of difficulties until this sort of relationship is built - and you are not taking care just of her kids, you have your own to look after. 2 small children (your own) + your older niece and nephew that you have a relationship with might not have been that much extra energy and burden, but two unknown kids - definitely you made the right choice raising the issue. \n\nYou sister is asking you to embrace a big change, but it is her that is making a blended family, not you. So she is not entitled to your unconditional childcare help.", "NTA.\n\nIf she's not introducing you to them, at least by Skype / FaceTime, I see it as her KNOWING the kids are brats, but her wanting the new sex buddy and not letting a little thing like YOUR unhappiness get in her way.", "NTA - Your sister is DELUSIONAL. She has no idea how her kids and her step kids are going to adjust to the change of their parents being married and all of them living together. So aside from you not knowing the step kids at all, you have no idea what the dynamic between all of the kids is going to look like - and since your kids will also be in the mix, that has the potential to significantly negatively impact them as well. What she is suggesting is a HORRIBLE idea. \n\nShe is twisting the idea of treating her step kids equally into a pretzel. Expecting you to get all the kids similar things for holiday presents? Absolutely! Expecting you to pretend like this isn't a massive adjustment for everybody and a significant amount of extra work for you? Absurd.", "NTA", "NTA. You don't know how they behave, what they like or dislike, allergies, etc. You don't know them. That's alot.", "NTA your sister and partner sound like messy people. She\u2019s marrying someone and hasn\u2019t even met their kids? Yikes. Poor children. They aren\u2019t being prioritized.", "NTA \n\nYou don't have to do things you don't want to when the deal changes. It probably would be super helpful to her family, but being nice in the past doesn't obligate you keep doing so, especially in a way that makes you uncomfortable.", "Nta\n\nFirst, she is taking advantage of your kindness.  Tell her she can now pay for childcare because you're done. \n\n\nYou're a lot more gracious than most people would be.\n\n\nShe is also in for a rude awakening on the cost of childcare for 4 children. \n\n\nAnyone who says anything can offer their time for free.", "NTA. You were watching her two kids for a small amount of money, but now she is changing the agreement. If you DO consider watching the new kids, make sure she increases the amount of money she is paying you. You are a stay-at-home mother with two children and were doing her a favor by watching hers, it's rude of her to be pushing this and guilt tripping you over HER change of plans. She should be thanking you for all the time you spent watching her children, instead, she wants more. Entitled.", "NTA\n\nyou gave your reasons and she is unwilling to do as you requested", "Wow! So tell us your sister has no plan how to deal with 2 more kids without telling us.\n\nNTA", "NTA your sister should have let you meet the kids or even discussed this with you before now, you taking on 2 more kids is not a small thing.\n\nDo they have allergies or do you have a car large enough to get them all to the doctor for example, you need to meet them so you can get an idea of what they are like. \nI would not be doing this without meeting with the kids a few times before.\n\nYour sister and new hubby want to land kids with a stranger every day starting before the wedding, this is not fair on you or the kids what if they are terrors then what are you just meant to deal with them so she can play happy family. no,nope, no way, helping your sister is a nice thing you agreed to not for her to extend her family at your expense or your kids.", "NTA, you don\u2019t know these kids, they could be monster kids for all you know", "NTA \n\nShe should take a week off and watch all 6 kids just so she understands what she\u2019s asking of you.\n\nShe\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA. \n\n> My sister asked why I can't just embrace a big change and throw myself in\n\nThat\u2019s an unreasonable demand. Also, have you tried asking her why exactly she can\u2019t let you meet the kids first? Something smells funny about that. Sure she\u2019s getting married, she\u2019s busy, and they\u2019re out of state, but she might be hiding something, too. Does one or both of the future husband\u2019s kids have difficult or extra care requirements? I\u2019m getting a big feeling she\u2019s tryjng to push you into agreeing so it\u2019s harder for you to back out once you find out whatever she\u2019d hiding from you. \n\nWhat I\u2019m guessing is one or both kids have big behavioral problems, or big care needs that are demanding. Medical conditions, developmental problems, etc. Stuff like that can be really demanding and rough, and entitled people all follow the same trickster pattern when they intentionally conceal this and try to force someone to agree to dealing with it in advance, so if that person later tries to back out, they can play the \u201cbut you already agreed!\u201d card. If this happens, try and remember no matter what tricks she falls back on that she tried to manipulate you. If this isn\u2019t the case, then fine, but she\u2019s still being pretty unreasonable.", "NTA. Your sister is living in a Brady Bunch fantasy.

Your sister expecting you to suddenly take care of 6 kids, 2 of them absolute strangers not only to yourself but your own kids as well?

You've graduated from babysitter to zoo keeper. This makes my aforementioned points even more valid. Kids act as each others' hype managers so things will be able to get out of control really freaking quickly. And if you need to punish these kids, what do they respond to? Time outs? Chores?
