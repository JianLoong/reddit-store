Let's just say that I'd never gotten home so fast as I did after that phone call... no speeding fine, no hitting a random wild animal on the road either (live country and not uncommon for people to hit something at night - though you aren't safe during the day either - not that long ago I had a deer run right in front of me - luckily it didn't pause and just kept going otherwise it might've been hit).\n\nSo no parentification there... and in fact it would've been child abuse if I'd done it.
