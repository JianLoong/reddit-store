Opie knew the signs and mum still chose to act oblivious.", "> Agreed, but SO WHAT? I mean, have some empathy, some fucking compassion, for Christ's sake!\n\nHow much compassion would you have for somebody who deliberately cut off their fingers, despite being warned not to, and then whined about not being able to tie their shoelaces?", "oh my god. op snorted. quit acting like she went into a hysterical laughing fit rolling on the floor and crying while she called her mother an idiot who got what she deserved \ud83d\ude44", "/whoosh.", "Dude you\u2019re laughing at a mother\u2019s grief and telling me to seek help? Get a grip and learn compassion", "That is a ridiculous analogy.\n\nAnd OP sucks for that stunning lack of heart. I think the mama has two children to cry over, not one.", "People suck.\n\nThis is why our species is self-destructing. \n\nRationality of thought, coupled with generosity of feeling.\n\nThat's what we need and what we'll never get.", "Yeah like your original comment of \"Remind your mother what the definition of insanity is\" was an obvious joke and you're not just backtracking because you're wrong, right. What's the punchline?", "Jumping the gun, are we?\n\nI'm good though, you obviously need it\n\nLaughing at her grief, nah. I am laughing at the fact she chose to take the risk of \"placing her hands in the open fire\" and still complained when she KNEW very well the dangers of it and not better preparing herself.", "\n\n>That is a ridiculous analogy\n\nno, its a pretty apt one, actually. mom set herself on fire to keep her daughter warm then complained to op that she was on fire.", "Okay I see your trying to be the saint here but, would you honestly do the same thing that opie's mother did? Not take precautions and allow a family, I don't care if it aunt Shirley or your twin sister, who is know for their thievery to come in to your home?\n\nYes it was a bit mean but what does the mother expect? The daughter to change overnight. It takes times and wanting to change. The mother loves her daughter but she clearly not bothered about her thiever; and yes she is not for she left her house, open to be pillaged and robbed.\n\nThe mother did not think rationally for what she did and you are right about that", "/whoosh.", "And it\u2019s not as if it was a choice between taking precautions against known thieves or never seeing her daughter. They could have eaten at a restaurant, with Mom taking the precaution of only bringing the cash she\u2019d need to cover the meal. If she had to have them at the house, she could have put the portable valuables in one of the bedrooms and locked the door.", "I can't believe I need to explain this.\n\nIt's a ridiculous analogy, because it doesn't take into account that the sister is her actual daughter, who she raised and loved.", "No, of course I wouldn't have done what the mother did, I think that bordered on deranged.\n\nBut if anything, that desperate behavior called for sympathy, not derision.", "Again, what's the punchline?", "you act as if that changes anything. we see all the time on this sub that family is not only just as likely, but, in fact, more likely to screw you over.", "AND STILL A FREAKING THIEF!!!! OH MY STARS", "I understand but the mother could have honestly just gone to a restaurant and handle it from there.\n\nI think maybe opie had enough of the sister's situation but if the mother still wants, she can reach out more and talk to her, but NOT AT HER HOUSE!!", "/whoosh.", "No, of course it doesn't change anything!! It only impacts the heartlessness of OP's cruel response to his mother.\n\nI said right off the bat that he was right about his sister and right that his mother shouldn't have had them over.\n\nBut just because he's right, should he treat his mother so meanly?\n\nIf you think the answer to that is yes, we have nothing more to discuss.\n\nI hate people.", "I keep saying this: I agree with OP that the mother was wrong. \n\nThe problem I have is with her heartless response. That's all.", "/.hsoohw", "Stop calling people insane, it's not nice.", "first, op is female. second, op was not mean or heartless. they just didn't sugarcoat things. sorry that offends you so much.", "Okay i understand your opinion. I wouldn't go with 100% heartless but hey, we have different opinions, but I respect yours"]}
