Me thinks you are projecting your insecurities into him. \n\nHope the dude runs! 19 and taking care of someone else's mistake? Yuck!", "Nta. First of all that is a disgusting idea and second if he does get a shirt that says dick finder and tell him your going out for a girls night and not to wait up. See how he likes that", "Nobody is the asshole", "NTA.  Is he in middle school?", "NTA.  Why does he think OP wearing a shirt saying dick tinder is soo different ?", "That is the worst costume idea I've ever heard", "NTA  if ur bf wants to wear a costume make it more  of a costume and not a  gruk attractor. And besides if he does wanna dress up there at many different friend group costumes, like cowboys, or characters form Mario, or even squid game guards", "my husband was such a big nerd I would have told him go ahead, knowing he was in for a lot of ridicule. Thats something a 12 year old would think is cool NTA", "I think he is right in saying it's different, cause socially it is.\n\nWhat's his level of seriousness, that's the real question. How other people are going to perceive it is just in combat with your own security, there.\n\nNot that you should have to be comfortable with it.", "1. It IS exactly the same. Precisely.\n2. It's an idiotic idea.\n3. A tee shirt does not a costume make.\n4. What bunch of grownass men does a group costume?\n4. It's still an idiotic idea.\n5. NTA", "ESH. Your boyfriend is going out looking like a moron and a Me Too fail, and you're thinking that's going to turn girls on? You're both staggeringly immature.", "Dw everyone out will just think they're a big group of losers", "Nta. But if they are as nerdy as they say then their chances are probably low anyway - tshirt or not \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Maybe it\u2019s because she is staying home with the baby while he gets to go out.  She probably wanted him to stay home so they could take the baby trick or treating.", "If you're worried he's out to get laid or will have at positive sexual attention pointed his way, then don't worry he'll be at the bottom of the barrel for that. \n\nIf you're worried that this is some of his personality showing through the cracks? You prob should be", "NTAH, it\u2019s just disrespectful and straight up embarrassing\u2026 if my boyfriend were to go out clubbing in a shirt saying that with or without me I would be embarrassed.", "Joke or no joke\u2026 movie reference or not, it is a crude, rude and raunchy tee shirt to wear!", "Break up with him and find someone more mature. NTA", "withholding judgement until OP informs us if this is an inbetweeners reference\n\nfor real life though please make sure this is someone you want around your kiddo, nerdy and lovable or lewd and lecherous \ud83d\ude02", "NTA clearly those shirts advertise that these gentlemen are on the pull. Luckily, it also will work largely to create a wide berth around them as very few women are going to be attracted to those shirts.\n\nHE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA is the biggest problem here. Sounds like your BF is excited to be out as one of the lads and definitely wants people to know he doesn't have a girlfriend.", "Make a deal: He can do it no complaints if the following weekend he looks after his kid whilst you and your friends go out wearing shirts and sashes that say \u201cDesperately Seeking Semen\u201d.\n\nNTA and he\u2019s not Austin Powers. Tell him to grow up or get out!", "For yall saying it\u2019s a reference to a movie. Why would he not explain that to her then?", "YTA definetly", "So many people here that just haven\u2019t seen the inbetweeners. I\u2019m assuming the reason your boyfriend is wearing the shirts is because of the joke in the show. Which is yeah maybe a bit immature but he\u2019s 19, he\u2019s gonna be a bit immature from time to time. I\u2019d be more worried if your bf was gonna be going out in a white button up with only half the buttons done up and brown chinos. Soft YTA for me\n\nEDIT: If you were out with your friends, and decided to wear a nice dress or something that looked good, would you get upset if he told you not to wear it? Same principle applies for me, don\u2019t police what other people wear.", "NAH \n\nBut girl, chill.

The main problem is the high cringe level.", "I also want to know if it\u2019s his baby?  \n\nCos if it isn\u2019t you\u2019ve been too successful at Dick Finding to wear that t shirt ironically.", "Those guys get laid a lot it\u2019s how the baby mamas end up here later making dumb posts", "its cringey and tacky.", "This is honestly the only question that matters.", "The real question \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It isn't either. They're worried about the intent", "I imagine he\u2019ll do pretty well for himself. If any ladies are wondering about whether he might be interested in what she has to offer, they can just check out his shirt.", "Wow what an absolutely disgusting assumption of a group of guys youve never met before. Hop off reddit and go outside you weirdo", "\ud83e\udd22", "I think people are missing the fact that it's supposed to be cringe. They're supposed to look stupid on purpose. Even if it wasn't a reference 4-5 nerdy dudes wearing \"pussy patrol\" shirts would still be a dorky and cringy costume, as intended.", ">Just gross and childish. I wonder why his friends are still single??\n\nIt's a reference to the show inbetweeners", "Its a joke and theyre 19 years old, stop being such a square", "It\u2019s a reference to a tv show/movie", "Most people aren\u2019t gonna get the reference and even so she said she\u2019s not comfortable with it and he doesn\u2019t care.

That wasn't her choice, genius. A mistake?\n\nHow is it possible to not understand that getting pregnant at 18 isn't a choice? She's fcking 18, which we once all were, but on top of that, you do NOT know what happened or who the father is.\n\nFckign disgusting mentality to hope she got dumped. Was she cumming into herself? God damn dude I swear, you make me wanna throw up and I do not have a female reproductive system. Don't need to be Einstein to realize how a baby is not made only by the vice of females. \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself foreal.", "I have been trying to figure this out for years what the fuck is a ick", "Pussy patrol Is A reference", "Is he not allowed to go out and have a night off? I\u2019m sure she does now and then. And it\u2019s just Halloween not Christmas", "Clearly it\u2019s a reference to the inbetweeners.

Funniest show of all time.", "Also, isn't the difference that \"Pussy Patrol\" is a pop culture reference aimed at being a joke? \nI think a better comparison would be those old shirts I remember seeing become popular in the early 2000s saying something like, I'm the FBI - female body inspector.

It's a raunchy british comedy made for teens", "Oh ok. I looked it up and it said it aired from 2008-2010. So the viewers would be like mid 30s now lol.
