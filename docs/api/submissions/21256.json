Deliberately fleecing them all night was rude, even if they did kinda ask for it. There's ways to get out of social annoyances without intentionally pissing off a whole room full of people.\n\nTopping it off, Mom just demanding you give the money back didn't help. You're 17, she needs to treat as more of an adult and less of \"you're a child, do as I order\".\n\nESH. Subpar decisions by everyone.", "That's literally the name of the game. NTA.\n\nBut if you were 'acting' the whole time, then that's ungenuine and YTA.", "ESH specifically because you pretended to have never played before.

Don't expect people to not be upset with you when you've been deliberately upsetting; do sleep easy at night knowing you did what you set out to do.  YTA and you don't get to complain about it.", "YTA. Pretend you never played before is different then just shutting up and whipping their ass\u2019es", "YTA not for what you did. The reasons you did it make you a complete ass.", "You were malitious in your actions, if they are bad players its beacouse they dont play it seriously. Its an excuse to have a muck about for them and you runined the vibe by deciding to lie and socially manipulate. Yeah its poker, but you acted in bad faith and are an AH for it.", "NTA that\u2019s hilarious and not your fault all. They should have known better.", "NTA $150 is a lot of money. But amongst a group of adults who I assume are at least over 30? It\u2019s not that much money. And certainly not that much if they are gambling with it. I don\u2019t play poker but I mean, isn\u2019t like 2/3rds of it psyching out your opponents?", "Nta, clearly he was trying to take advantage of you", "NTA.  Keep the money.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you bluffed and they fell for it.  Why gamble if you can't afforded to lose your money?

They were betting money. He's saying you weren't allowed to win. Total BS.", "NTA! And it seems like malicious compliance won the day here!!!", "NTA at all.

Good on you sir.", "NTA  sounds like they were hoping to fleece you", "NTA", "So I kinda think Y T A but in this case I think it\u2019s justified. You did con them, and even though it\u2019s poker that might have been a bit much for a casual game. However, you made it well known you only went reluctantly, so they should have had a heads up that you weren\u2019t going to be the best sport. They bothered you until you went, so much so you decided to give them a reason for them to never want to invite you again. Also, if they did place higher bets assuming that you were inexperienced they had intentions of making money as well. So while I do think you are a bit TA, I couldn\u2019t say that I wouldn\u2019t have done something similar in a situation like that.", "NTA! Poker is betting. You won fair & square.

Not for not giving the money back. But it was a friendly game. Just beat them? Sure, no problem. Take them for what they\u2019ll give you.

Next time, charge them for lessons.", "NTA. That\u2019s hilarious.

And yeah, making sure I put NTA here in the top thread.", "I've never played a hand of poker in my life, but even I know the whole point is deception and ability (or not) to read people.", ">people are dead ass calling OP an asshole for lying in poker.

I didn't realize it was such an honest game.\n\nRight!?!?! Isn't that the whole fucking point of poker???", "It really depends on the game and how active he was in making them think he was new. Like, let them think whatever they want but at the point where you're feeding into it at some low stakes house game it's kind of a dick move. a lot of people do house games just as an excuse to hang out and they'd be pretty justifiably salty about a stranger coming in and blatantly lying to their face to take their money. Yeah poker is about deception, but you're also in someone's home. If you want to disrespect everyone at the table, go to a casino.\n\n\nBut even then, you don't demand your $40 or whatever back, you just don't invite him again like he wanted lol", "Yep.  And if the kid had lost money, do you think they'd have all given it back?  Doubt it.  I bet they would have said something about it being a learning experience about playing with the big boys or something.", "How to you know that he was going to fleece him? He invited him to a friendly game to bond (according to the OP). The father didn't lie about anything, they were all inexperienced players by the sound of it", "And let's be honest, if he had told them straight up that he was actually good at poker, they would've been like haha ok yeah sure kid. OP is NTA at all and good for him lol.", "Everyone is assuming this but the guy is trying to get to know OP. For all we know they planned to give it all back.  \n\nYTA for actively fleecing them.  If you just played that's one thing, but playing dumb through the game then hustling is another, and not \"honest\" as you suggested.  You've definitely won in that they won't bother you again.", "The mom even urged OP to go to the game in the first place. Maybe SHE should work on her relationship with her kid before worrying about her kid getting along with her latest boyfriend", ">  got beat by a \"little girl\"\n\nOP is male.", "OP's soon-to-be stepdad invited him to the table.

Explain to me why he's the AH.", "The whole point of poker is to trick your adversaries", "That's how poker works. You play your opponents more than you play your cards. As Kenny Rogers sang: [You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em](https://youtu.be/7hx4gdlfamo).", "Deception is literally the whole point of poker.", "Yes, because poker is known for its principles of honesty", "Have you ever played poker before? That's how it works! You play your opponents, not your cards!", "Lol you have no clue", "What a dumb take this is. It's NOT illegal to lie about your skill at poker. Good lord.", "Have you ever played poker before? 90% of the game is pretending you have something you don't. You play your opponents, not your cards!", "Except in poker its called bluffing and its pretty much the point of the game...", "So...granted I have a weird relationship with gambling since my grandparents saw it as a sin. They wouldn't keep cards in the house in case they would be tempted. What the ever loving F is she doing not tearing her dude a new one asking her son to gamble?!? Good for you. This was an inappropriate way to \"bond\" in my opinion.  DnD would have been way better. If they weren't playing for change then why invite a minor? I'm mad at your mom.", "Just go ahead and ask, \u201cWell, had I lost, would you be making the winner return his profits?\u201d He\u2019s embarrassed and angry that he was beaten by a minor, particularly one that he invited expecting you to bite it(why else would he be mad when you win?).\n\nNTA, OP. Your mom wants you to concede to make her life easier; however, the only way that can be accomplished is by you sacrificing something that you earned and your own happiness.

As long as you did. It cross that k8nd of line then by all means enjoy your winnings", "I was being sarcastic.", "Okay, but even if he started off outright lying, they should've figured it out soon enough. He didn't win $150 in a low-stakes house game in one hand. If they continued to believe he didn't know what he was doing once he was up $40, that's on them. They're mad and embarrassed they lost to a kid, which isn't a good enough reason to give up his winnings.", "*a stranger that did not want to be there", "I've never played a game of anything without the intention of winning, so I don't get why this is a dick move.

In others you went into that game specifically to be an AH.", "Actually good decision making is the whole point. Deception is a means to that end.

I called him about tomorrow and brought this up. He said if it is a friendly game at somebody\u2019s house and not a casino, and someone says I am a novice, they go easy.
