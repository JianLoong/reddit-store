My (f25) parents divorced when I was a baby. I lived with my father for 8 years, until me and my older brother were seized by child services for abuse and neglect. \n\nMy mother filed for custody and we lived with her and my stepfather for 2  peaceful years. During those 2 years I was finally starting to get acclimated to what normal life was like, free of the abuse and extreme poverty that I was living in with my dad. \n\nMy mother, who had be trying for another kid, despite her age and doctor\u2019s warnings, decided to bring my my younger brother to full term. He has Down syndrome and is considered \u201clow functioning\u201d.\n\nHe was born when I was 10 years old and spent the majority of my adolescence taking care of him. I went to school, came home, and was with him until I went to bed. I watched him on the weekends with my only \u201cday off\u201d being Sundays. In the summers my stepfather would be upstairs in his room while I was with my little brother in living room all day. \n\nI\u2019d do his hair, change his pull-ups, make his meals, clean up his vomit etc. \nMy stepfather would yell at me because I wasn\u2019t trying to teach him how to go potty or because I changed the channel from his favorite show, that would have to be played 24/7. (I still can\u2019t watch that show because it brings back bad memories)\n\nFast forward to now, my mother doesn\u2019t ask much from me, but she recently asked me to watch my younger brother as a Mother\u2019s Day gift. I hesitated because all the memories of my childhood came back. I asked her to let me think about it, but she immediately reassured me and said that it was okay and that I don\u2019t have to. I still feel guilty for not fulfilling her wish, but when I think about watching him again I get so stressed out, like I\u2019m a kid with no control again.\n\nShould I feel guilty?

Like previously stated, asked, answered, no problems. Since both of you effectively were his \u2018mom\u2019 it sounds like maybe the FIL should volunteer for pull-up duty.", "NTA.  You escaped the abuse if your dad's household only to be abused in a different way by your mom and step-dad.  Parentification is abuse.  Your younger brother never should have been your responsibility to the extent he was.  Your mother allowed her husband to scream at you and verbally abuse you and they both abused you by dumping the care of your brother on you.\n\nTo be blunt, she doesn't deserve to be honored on mother's day because she abused you.", "Maybe her husband and the child's father can help for three seconds. \n\nNTA.

Whether her mother knew or not, her mother is TA, as she reasonably should have known what her daughter was doing.", "I agree to an extent. Although I think we need some more INFO - what *was* OP's mother doing during all of this? Since OP didn't specify I assumed it was just a custody type problem.\n\nThen again, the question was specifically if she should feel guilty or not in which there really isn't anyone in the wrong.

My mother was the main breadwinner and also did most household chores. My stepfather was more involved with child rearing, which you can see how that went. So yes she knew what was going on.
