I'm writing this from my mobile as I'm out of the house - for reasons you'll see \u2013 so I'll try my best with the formatting. \n\n  \nI feel like I'm going crazy in the last few days and could use some outside perspective on whether I'm in the wrong or not. \n\n  \n**The Situation**:  \nSo, my wife (29F) and I (31M) have been married for five years, and overall, we've had a great relationship. However, we've recently hit a rough patch when it comes to our finances.\n\n  \nMy wife is a stay-at-home mom to our two kids (3F and 5M), and she does an incredible job. I work a demanding job that requires long hours, but it pays well enough for us to live comfortably. We've always had a joint account where my salary goes, and she handles all the expenses from there.\n\n  \n**The Issue:**  \nLately, I've noticed that our savings have been dwindling faster than usual. I sat down and went through our expenses, only to find out that she's been making some questionable purchases. I'm talking about luxury items like designer handbags and spa treatments, amounting to thousands of dollars.\n\n  \nI tried to talk to her about this, and it didn't go well. She argued that since she's taking care of the kids full-time, she deserves to treat herself from time to time. I get it, being a parent is tough, but it feels like there should be some moderation.\n\n  \n**My Stance:**  \nI believe in treating oneself, but within reason. We need to think about our children's future and have a safety net for emergencies. I suggested that we set a budget for personal expenses, so we can both enjoy some freedom without jeopardizing our financial stability.\n\n  \n**Her Reaction:**  \nShe was not happy about this proposal at all. She accused me of being controlling and not appreciating the sacrifices she makes as a stay-at-home mom. She thinks I'm being stingy and that I don't understand how important self-care is for her mental well-being.\n\n  \n**The Dilemma:**  \nHere's where it gets tricky. I recently discovered she's been having private shopping sprees without my knowledge, sometimes maxing out our credit cards. When I confronted her, she got defensive and accused me of not trusting her. This has led to a major rift in our relationship, and I'm seriously questioning whether I can trust her with our finances anymore.\n\n  \nanyways, I'm at a loss. Am I the asshole for wanting to establish some boundaries on our spending, given this new revelation? Is there a compromise that I'm not seeing here, or do I need to take more drastic measures to protect our financial stability?\n\nMy battery is low so I might not be able to respond to all of you. I'm open to any advice or perspective on this matter. \n\nThanks in advance, reddit.  \n", "created_utc": 1695923355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16umlh8/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_wife/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This has led to a major rift in our relationship, and I'm seriously questioning whether I can trust her with our finances anymore.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne risk of marriage is that your partner financially ruins the both of you. If this is new behavior, it sounds like something is going on. Yes, you may have to take more drastic measures. Which will no doubt cause more revenge-blowups.\n\nMaxing out credit cards is really not something that should happen if you're living comfortably.", "NTA.  It sounds like you need to put some brakes on your wife's spending before your savings are depleted and you end up in a debt cycle.  Some self care things like hair, nails, a massage are normal but designer handbags and maxing out credit cards seems excessive.   I agree with the poster who mentioned therapy.  Some mental illnesses like bipolar depression have symptoms of impulsive and excessive spending (I know that's a leap), but whatever it is, she is using shopping to compensate for something else.", "NTA financial irresponsibility is not a reward for being the stay at home parent. You might actually want to look a bit deeper into things if this is new behavior to rule out anything else that might be going on.", "NTA. I was a SAHM for many years, and my husband and I had a similar financial arrangement. Your proposal is reasonable and fair. She\u2019s entitled to some luxury items and self care, such as hair, makeup, etc., but her spending sounds out of control. \n\nI understand being a SAHM can make a person feel dumpy, and it can certainly be depressing. There\u2019s probably more going on than her wanting to treat herself like a movie star. It sounds like she needs these things to help with her self esteem. Would she talk to a therapist?", "NTA. Shared finances means both partners are aware of and generally agree to each other's spending. She is literally taking money out of your kids' future to treat herself.", "NTA.  A set amount of disposable funds is a foundational part of budgeting.", "You need help or a divorce, finances is the number one reason for divorce.  She really needs to think of everyone not just herself.  Your credit and future are in danger.", "NTA\n\nJoint finances means joint agreements on expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think anything over $200 should be discussed.  But, thats based upon my personal financial situation. 100 or 1000 might be the right number for you.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou recognize it's joint $ because she's taking care of the children which means she's an equal earning partner -  as we know it's hard forewoman who take breaks in career to rejoin.  Choosing to stay home can hinder a woman's ability to be part of a career that woman previously was part of.\n\nYou aren't saying this.  You are saying that she is spending your joint funds without any control - something if you did would be equally egregious\n\nAgree on a fun fun -- which I think you are wiling to do. BTW - you don't trust her because she's being untrustworthy with finances.  \n\n\nMy spouse and I agree on all expensive purchases - like he wanted to buy a kitchen thing which wasn't that expensive but would take up counter space and asked.\n\nWe both are empty nesters and our kids were in daycare - I was a salaried-engineer my entire children's existstence and so we both bring in similar amounts, but we consider our estate and retirement and child based expenses to be something we both cared about enabling, and so worked together.\n\nJust checking in with each other.  'hey I'm going to buy...'", "NTA.  It may be that your wife has a shopping addiction, or is overcompensating for something she is experiencing emotionally.  It may be that she is high maintenance and believes she is deserved of it all.  However, you need to protect your families well being.  I would cancel the credit cards, and sign up to be notified of any financial transactions.  I would also take over payment of all bills, remove her name from your joint account and establish an account for the \"extras\" she needs in a reasonable amount.", "NTA. You recognized her need to treat herself once in a while, so proposed that your household budget include such things.Unkesd the amount proposed isn't enough to cover anything at all, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\n\nIf your 3 year old is in nursery school, and I assume the 5 year old is in kindergarten, perhaps your wife could get a part time job. That could increase the amount you budget for \"self care\".", "NTA. Your wife behaviour has changed, something is going on.  It may be a new friendship, a touch of jealousy, depression, feeling unappreciated, or a whole bunch of other things.  Your wife may not realise the extent of her spending.   Sit her down and get to the bottom of what's going on, she's not going to straighten out until you do.\n\nGood luck", "Info:\n\nIs she okay? \n\nIf this is not something she\u2019s done a lot in the past what\u2019s suddenly changed?", "I think something more is going on with your wife. If you just brought this up first time today she might need a few hours to think it through and get on board however it sounds like she could have a spending problem that is a que for mental health concern. Yes that's a leap but just saying. I was a SAHM for 13 years without a problem sticking with a system you suggested. \nAnother consideration is I didn't hear that you sat down and looked at your finances together. She might be in the dark with your actual income, investments, goals etc.", "Maybe try suggesting that she gets a job and you stay at home.  Her tune will change pretty quickly.", "NTA. There clearly is some issue at hand that leads to her overspending. Just budgeting more tightly won't solve the underlying issue, just lead to her covertly spending more money, i.e. maxing out \"secret\" credit cards or other behaviours. It won't bring her to confront her issues.", "definitely NTA but ideally she'd be on board with this plan. you could force it but i think it would hurt your marriage too much.\n\nit sounds like you've made a really reasonable proposal but have you actually sat down with her and gone thru your household finanaces. gone thru- this is how much we have coming in each months, this is what we spend on fixed things, so this is what is left for us to spend on stuff like food and whatnot. \n\nand than go thru how much the savings has been drawn down. and have a honest conversation about the impact to the household including the kids about this spending.\n\ni'd include in the conversation that if she wants to go back to work, even if its part time, that the two of you can figure out how to make that work. (i assume this is really a keeping up with the jones thing and that she has mommy friends who spend money without looking at the price tag so she wants to be able to do the same thing but she doesn't know what going on in their homes or what their debts look like.) but on the off chance that this is about her wanting to work- even if she isn't aware of it- i think it's a worthwhile thing to bring up.", "NTA she is going to drive you into a lot of debt if she can't stop spending. If she wants to buy a lot of luxury items she needs to go find a job that pays enough for her to be able to split the bills and daycare costs with you, then she can use whatever is left to buy herself fun stuff.", "NTA\n\nAs soon as she threw out the buzzword \"controlling\" for a simple discussion about finances, I would have shut her down completely.\n\nI do not play those games with anybody.\n\nYou need to actually take CONTROL of your finances since she obviously can no longer be trusted with them.  She wants to accuse you of being controlling.  DO IT.\n\nPrediction:  If she keeps control of the money, she is going to run your lives into the ground, then complain that you don't make enough money, dump you and find a man who makes more.", "Nta 'no honey, I don't trust you bc you're running up our credit card behind my back, hiding purchases, and refusing to discuss it.  None of that is trust worthy behavior'\n\nYou absolutely need a budget. Everyone needs to know where their money goes.", "NTA, and it's time you ran a credit report.\n\nThat being said, she needs some personal spending money out of the family budget. Money that is set aside for a purse/ spa day/ whatever, it just can't be a free for all.", "Another option\n\nShe gets a job. Her pay check can go towards the cost of day care, a twice weekly  house cleaning service, and anything she wants to buy for herself.", "NTA: There is clearly more going on here though.  People don't just develop issues with moderation over night.  Either she has always been like this and you didn't notice until it started to impact you more, or this has been building for some time.  Ask why more, and maybe suggest therapy and healthier self care.  It seems odd that she jumped to financial abuse so quickly.", "back to work in 2 years hopefully! NTA", "Maxing out credit cards is not a little treat. A treat would be a fancy drink from Starbucks. We are talking thousands of dollars that is just not OK", "\"...she got defensive and accused me of not trusting her...\"\n\nBecause she has freely demonstrated that she is extremely UNtrustworthy.\n\nMaxing out secret credit cards? Oh my. You have a big BIG problem.\n\nNTA.", "I saw this suggestion on another post. Handle this like a group project. Put together a sheet showing what your monthly income is and log every single expense that is a must: rent/mortgage, car, utilities, gas, credit card payments, etc.  Let her know that of course she's worth having everything she wants, but there has to be a line so that you can save and provide for your children's futures, for family trips, and holidays, etc. \nMaybe if she sees it in black and white she'll understand this isn't coming from an opinion of what she's worth, this is just the facts of your current lifestyle.", " NTA, insist on couples therapy.", "Obviously, she is not happy and doesn\u2019t feel fulfilled. \nGiving in to a shopping addiction is one way to feel fulfilled, although very temporarily.\nShe could\u2019ve also had an affair, develop an eating disorder or a sports addiction. Anything to feel numb for a short but sweet amount of time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say: don\u2019t try to solve this superficially. There is way more to it than just financial ignorance \n\nShe feels worthless, she feels bored, she doesn\u2019t feel alive anymore and she isn\u2019t challenged to live her full potential\n\nA designer bag gives the feeling of being on top of your game,  it it wears out after a few hours or days. And then she needs more.\n\nMake all this the topic of your conversation \n\nDarling, how are you. What are you feeling. What makes you happy, what makes you sad, what would you like to change in your life, what would be your ideal living situation, perhaps get a job?\n\nCommunicate!\nHer shopping sprees are only a symptom of the problem that lies beneath\n\nAlso, if y\u00f3u\u2019re the one to tell her she can\u2019t buy these things anymore, she\u2019ll feel even smaller and worthless. Sh\u00e9 needs to be the one to figure out something else is going on and that spending her (and your) money this way is a waste \nShe needs to take ownership and the lead over \u2018getting better and stronger\u2019\nYou just have to be smart enough to make her realize what\u2019s going on\n\nNAH", "There is some reaaally good advice here, so I won\u2019t rehash it except to say ignore the \u201cdivorce\u201d preachers. \n\nReplyingForFriends gave a very good and thoughtful response, specifically about how we humans find fulfillment. Your wife feels something lacking, and she\u2019s plugging that hole with shopping. It\u2019s all about the oxytocin and dopamine. \n\nImma go with NAH but caution against adopting a hard \u201cthis is how it\u2019s going to be\u201d stance, as that\u2019s controlling and you are 50/50 partners in this relationship. At the same time, she has to be willing to yield ground, as well. \n\nInstead of dictating a system, ask her how much she thinks she needs and establish that as her budget. If it is unreasonable or untenable, show her why. Then negotiate something more workable. \n\nAnd for everyone else who\u2019s about to weigh in and say some version of \u201cIt\u2019s his money and she should go get a job,\u201d stuff that.

It's not controlling to put this in place. There should also be savings goals! And agreed-upon cash flows into accounts/buckets with purposes attached (home upgrades, travel, kids' education, retirements...). \n\nThe fact that she's resistant to it has deeper reasons. If you fundamentally trust her, then I think the two likeliest reasons are:\n\n* A lack of financial skills / education. The fact that she even considers maxing out credit cards - presumably, not paying them off every month - is pointing in the direction that there's a knowledge gap on how to handle money\n* Some deep-seated feeling of losing out that comes out in unexpected ways. Is she feeling, for example, that she's missing out on professional fulfillment? *Your* life may look to her as one of increasing responsibility, recognition and raises, and hers looks stagnating and losing out - is this possible?\n\nIn any event, my suggestion is to dig until you get to a common ground. This could be \"we both should have a budget for our fun spending\" or \"we acknowledge that we aren't on the same page, and need to figure out how to get on it\". Don't just translate your - justified! - anxiety over the spending getting out of hand into something one-sided such as \"setting boundaries with your own money\". Not until you've actually found she isn't trustworthy - maybe she isn't! But then it's divorce time, and you still think of her as great at what she does etc. \n\nSo get help. If you think it's mostly an education issue would she be amenable to learning more about how money is managed? Or both of you together, if you don't feel yourself 100% on top of it?

If her spending is hurting your finances that much you can either get her in line or just deal with the consequences. Either decision has fall out either way. You just have to decide which fall out you're more comfortable dealing with. And angry wife or a negative bank account.", "What your wife is doing is wrong, but I can understand it as a SAHM myself. Of course you should do some due diligence and not rule out the possibility that she's having an affair or has concrete plans to file for divorce, or anything like that. But I don't think that those sorts of possibilities are necessarily the reason for this sort of behavior. \n\nWhen you become a SAHM, you no longer have direct power over your financial fate, because you are not earning an income. And, as we all know, the longer you are outside of the workforce, the harder it is to get back in. So there is a real sense of the loss of control over your future, that actually can be quite depressing. So that is one way that a SAHM can develop a \"need\" for material goods, to make themselves feel better about their life.\n\nI think it is also very easy for a husband to, without intending it, make his SAHW feel worthless, because she is not earning an income. And that is because the way a SAHM \"saves\" money, is to spend less. Every penny you spend is a loss because it's a penny you no longer have. Your husband's activities are an asset to the family, while yours are a liability. He brings money in for the family, all you do is make money leave the family. And if there is just one earner, usually that earner is quite concerned about running out of money, so the need to reduce spending, and discussion of what are nonessential purchases, is a constant topic of conversation. \n\nSo there is this constant pressure to spend less, because the way you make yourself a more valuable and acceptable wife, is to stem the flow of money outwards. Of course there are lots of things that have to be bought. Food, cleaning supplies, clothes for the children, and so on. So where can you cut spending to save money? Well you can cut spending on things for yourself. \n\nSo the economic pattern that you can't avoid, when you are a SAHM, is that every penny you spend on yourself is basically a waste of the family's money. If you get a haircut at the competent hair salon instead of the budget chain store down the street, then the extra cost is a waste of money. Pedicure? Waste of money. New clothes? Why? You don't need a nice outfit to go to work in! Waste of money. How about a babysitter, so you can occasionally get a break from the kids? Well, babysitters are expensive, why can't you just take your kids WITH you to the doctor? Getting a book for your book club? Can't you get that at the library? Your hobby is costing this family money! \n\nThe overall effect is that the woman can feel as if her job is to keep making herself and her needs smaller and smaller. Her needs and wants are a burden to the family. This can feel very dehumanizing and generate resentment. From that resentment, you can get a reaction: I shouldn't have to make myself smaller and smaller while everyone else in the family is allowed to grow and have their needs considered important. I'm worth being able to spend money on nice things for myself.\" Based on what your wife says, my guess is that this is the underlying mechanism beneath her behavior. If this is the case, then, to solve the problem, you need to solve that underlying mechanism. Obviously, the more you push the idea that you need to save more, and the more you try to explain that \"this\" or \"that\", or \"the other\" purchase is unnecessary, the worse you will make the problem, because what she will hear is, \"You are only worthwhile if your existence costs me as close to zero dollars as possible.\"\n\nIt would probably be useful to go back over some of your arguments in your head and see if you have any unreasonable expectations of keeping costs down. In my husband's case, I think where it crossed the line for me was when we went out to dinner (twice per year, eyeroll, a real romantic that guy) with his parents and our child, and my husband got the most expensive thing on the menu and then told me that I should share my cheese pasta (aka cheapest thing on the menu) with my toddler because (his claim, not mine) I didn't need the whole meal anyway and buying a separate child's meal for him would be a \"waste of money.\" I've never forgotten or forgiven that (wrong, I know).  In my husband's mind, his reasoning made complete sense, and it would never have occurred to him to think that he had made me feel worthless by saying that. But that's how he made me feel, then and many, many other times that he exhorted me to spend less on my own welfare so we could \"save money.\"", "NTA.

And if you want to ensure the necessities are covered then this needs to be resolved one way or another.\n\nObviously the discussions you\u2019ve had haven\u2019t been effective, so I think it\u2019s worthwhile considering how your wife was raised to handle money and what are her ingrained attitudes towards it.\n\nEg, I was raised by two people who never seemed to be able save a brass razoo in spite of both being in moderate paying professions- and extravagant spending was a proxy for the resentment in the relationship and the dopamine of retail therapy. It all came to a head when they finally were able to buy a home, and borrowed enough for renovations\u2026only to discover that ween them they were servicing (kinda) 36k- half the renovation money). Cards were cancelled and they had no option but to save for extraordinary purchases (salaries went on the mortgage and normal expenses drawn from that (saves heaps of interest if you leave more than the monthly payment each month).

Think it out, there is no excuse for her.", "Also don't say \"Bipolar spending\" that is offensive to us.\n\nAlso symptoms and episodes vary in intensity, and you cannot make a generalisation like that.", "What are you going to do if your husband suddenly leaves you? Or god forbid dies. Probate takes quite awhile and you will have no access to funds. If you are happy that\u2019s rad but don\u2019t try and paint it as normal.", "Don't you know, women are infants, they are never responsible for their actions.", "So sorry that\u2019s the life that the women and girls you know have.", "I'm bipolar. I'm part of \"us\".  It's also one of my main symptoms. I'll characterize it how I want to.\n\nEdit: Since when does noting a symptom mean you're being offensive?", "I have several family friends that are lawyers of the kind I would need. I live in CA so I would get half of everything plus have of the income for half of the time we have been married. I would never need to work a day in my life. If he died I would get everything. Oh, and, I told you it was complicated and I'm not sharing all of my info with you.\n\nNot sure why you're you're so offended/ interested in my marriage and finances.", "What are you talking about now? I took a hard line with wife's spending. You're just spouting nonsense now. What did I say that made you think I thought that?", "That's your opinion. My life growing up was rather awesome. Just because my dad, friends dads didn't notice an imperceptible hair cut and color change, that means you think I had a shitty time? If I dyed my hair blue, yeah my dad would notice but not variations of the same color.\n\nIf you grew up my way you would get get it as I'm sure if I grew up your way I would get your perspective.", "Then stop spreading misinformation about your own condition", "Straw man arguments are your forte. Sleep well", "Again, I don't know why you are so concerned/ offended by my marriage that you A. are not in, and B. know very little about.", "You keep telling the world about your relationship trying to win a internet argument. I only asked what you would do because you will be fucked. Probate is the process that an estate has to go through before monies are divided, this can take years. Divorce in California is only 50/50 split after ten years and can take years. If anything that you have written is true then you need to have your name on the credit cards even if you don\u2019t have access so that in a worse case scenario you can order a card so that you can pay bills and eat until you have access to the set for life money.\nYou have posted more in the last 24hours then I have in last seven years I have been on this site. You are clearly going through something right now and that\u2019s fine. If this is how you are getting your dopamine cool. But for your own sake it\u2019s time to do some self reflection on why you need it."]}
