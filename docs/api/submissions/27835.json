I'm writing this from my mobile as I'm out of the house - for reasons you'll see \u2013 so I'll try my best with the formatting. \n\n  \nI feel like I'm going crazy in the last few days and could use some outside perspective on whether I'm in the wrong or not. \n\n  \n**The Situation**:  \nSo, my wife (29F) and I (31M) have been married for five years, and overall, we've had a great relationship. However, we've recently hit a rough patch when it comes to our finances.\n\n  \nMy wife is a stay-at-home mom to our two kids (3F and 5M), and she does an incredible job. I work a demanding job that requires long hours, but it pays well enough for us to live comfortably. We've always had a joint account where my salary goes, and she handles all the expenses from there.\n\n  \n**The Issue:**  \nLately, I've noticed that our savings have been dwindling faster than usual. I sat down and went through our expenses, only to find out that she's been making some questionable purchases. I'm talking about luxury items like designer handbags and spa treatments, amounting to thousands of dollars.\n\n  \nI tried to talk to her about this, and it didn't go well. She argued that since she's taking care of the kids full-time, she deserves to treat herself from time to time. I get it, being a parent is tough, but it feels like there should be some moderation.\n\n  \n**My Stance:**  \nI believe in treating oneself, but within reason. We need to think about our children's future and have a safety net for emergencies. I suggested that we set a budget for personal expenses, so we can both enjoy some freedom without jeopardizing our financial stability.\n\n  \n**Her Reaction:**  \nShe was not happy about this proposal at all. She accused me of being controlling and not appreciating the sacrifices she makes as a stay-at-home mom. She thinks I'm being stingy and that I don't understand how important self-care is for her mental well-being.\n\n  \n**The Dilemma:**  \nHere's where it gets tricky. I recently discovered she's been having private shopping sprees without my knowledge, sometimes maxing out our credit cards. When I confronted her, she got defensive and accused me of not trusting her. This has led to a major rift in our relationship, and I'm seriously questioning whether I can trust her with our finances anymore.\n\n  \nanyways, I'm at a loss. Am I the asshole for wanting to establish some boundaries on our spending, given this new revelation? Is there a compromise that I'm not seeing here, or do I need to take more drastic measures to protect our financial stability?\n\nMy battery is low so I might not be able to respond to all of you. I'm open to any advice or perspective on this matter. \n\nThanks in advance, reddit.  \n", "created_utc": 1695923355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16umlh8/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_wife/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This has led to a major rift in our relationship, and I'm seriously questioning whether I can trust her with our finances anymore.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne risk of marriage is that your partner financially ruins the both of you. If this is new behavior, it sounds like something is going on. Yes, you may have to take more drastic measures. Which will no doubt cause more revenge-blowups.\n\nMaxing out credit cards is really not something that should happen if you're living comfortably.", "NTA.  It sounds like you need to put some brakes on your wife's spending before your savings are depleted and you end up in a debt cycle.  Some self care things like hair, nails, a massage are normal but designer handbags and maxing out credit cards seems excessive.   I agree with the poster who mentioned therapy.  Some mental illnesses like bipolar depression have symptoms of impulsive and excessive spending (I know that's a leap), but whatever it is, she is using shopping to compensate for something else.", "NTA financial irresponsibility is not a reward for being the stay at home parent. You might actually want to look a bit deeper into things if this is new behavior to rule out anything else that might be going on.", "NTA. I was a SAHM for many years, and my husband and I had a similar financial arrangement. Your proposal is reasonable and fair. She\u2019s entitled to some luxury items and self care, such as hair, makeup, etc., but her spending sounds out of control. \n\nI understand being a SAHM can make a person feel dumpy, and it can certainly be depressing. There\u2019s probably more going on than her wanting to treat herself like a movie star. It sounds like she needs these things to help with her self esteem. Would she talk to a therapist?", "NTA. Shared finances means both partners are aware of and generally agree to each other's spending. She is literally taking money out of your kids' future to treat herself.", "NTA.  A set amount of disposable funds is a foundational part of budgeting.", "You need help or a divorce, finances is the number one reason for divorce.  She really needs to think of everyone not just herself.  Your credit and future are in danger.", "NTA\n\nJoint finances means joint agreements on expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think anything over $200 should be discussed.  But, thats based upon my personal financial situation. 100 or 1000 might be the right number for you.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou recognize it's joint $ because she's taking care of the children which means she's an equal earning partner -  as we know it's hard forewoman who take breaks in career to rejoin.  Choosing to stay home can hinder a woman's ability to be part of a career that woman previously was part of.\n\nYou aren't saying this.  You are saying that she is spending your joint funds without any control - something if you did would be equally egregious\n\nAgree on a fun fun -- which I think you are wiling to do. BTW - you don't trust her because she's being untrustworthy with finances.  \n\n\nMy spouse and I agree on all expensive purchases - like he wanted to buy a kitchen thing which wasn't that expensive but would take up counter space and asked.\n\nWe both are empty nesters and our kids were in daycare - I was a salaried-engineer my entire children's existstence and so we both bring in similar amounts, but we consider our estate and retirement and child based expenses to be something we both cared about enabling, and so worked together.\n\nJust checking in with each other.  'hey I'm going to buy...'", "NTA.  It may be that your wife has a shopping addiction, or is overcompensating for something she is experiencing emotionally.  It may be that she is high maintenance and believes she is deserved of it all.  However, you need to protect your families well being.  I would cancel the credit cards, and sign up to be notified of any financial transactions.  I would also take over payment of all bills, remove her name from your joint account and establish an account for the \"extras\" she needs in a reasonable amount.", "NTA. You recognized her need to treat herself once in a while, so proposed that your household budget include such things.Unkesd the amount proposed isn't enough to cover anything at all, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\n\nIf your 3 year old is in nursery school, and I assume the 5 year old is in kindergarten, perhaps your wife could get a part time job. That could increase the amount you budget for \"self care\".", "NTA. Your wife behaviour has changed, something is going on.  It may be a new friendship, a touch of jealousy, depression, feeling unappreciated, or a whole bunch of other things.  Your wife may not realise the extent of her spending.   Sit her down and get to the bottom of what's going on, she's not going to straighten out until you do.\n\nGood luck", "Info:\n\nIs she okay? \n\nIf this is not something she\u2019s done a lot in the past what\u2019s suddenly changed?", "I think something more is going on with your wife. If you just brought this up first time today she might need a few hours to think it through and get on board however it sounds like she could have a spending problem that is a que for mental health concern. Yes that's a leap but just saying. I was a SAHM for 13 years without a problem sticking with a system you suggested. \nAnother consideration is I didn't hear that you sat down and looked at your finances together. She might be in the dark with your actual income, investments, goals etc.", "Maybe try suggesting that she gets a job and you stay at home.  Her tune will change pretty quickly.", "NTA. There clearly is some issue at hand that leads to her overspending. Just budgeting more tightly won't solve the underlying issue, just lead to her covertly spending more money, i.e. maxing out \"secret\" credit cards or other behaviours. It won't bring her to confront her issues.", "definitely NTA but ideally she'd be on board with this plan. you could force it but i think it would hurt your marriage too much.\n\nit sounds like you've made a really reasonable proposal but have you actually sat down with her and gone thru your household finanaces. gone thru- this is how much we have coming in each months, this is what we spend on fixed things, so this is what is left for us to spend on stuff like food and whatnot. \n\nand than go thru how much the savings has been drawn down. and have a honest conversation about the impact to the household including the kids about this spending.\n\ni'd include in the conversation that if she wants to go back to work, even if its part time, that the two of you can figure out how to make that work. (i assume this is really a keeping up with the jones thing and that she has mommy friends who spend money without looking at the price tag so she wants to be able to do the same thing but she doesn't know what going on in their homes or what their debts look like.) but on the off chance that this is about her wanting to work- even if she isn't aware of it- i think it's a worthwhile thing to bring up.", "NTA she is going to drive you into a lot of debt if she can't stop spending. If she wants to buy a lot of luxury items she needs to go find a job that pays enough for her to be able to split the bills and daycare costs with you, then she can use whatever is left to buy herself fun stuff.", "NTA\n\nAs soon as she threw out the buzzword \"controlling\" for a simple discussion about finances, I would have shut her down completely.\n\nI do not play those games with anybody.\n\nYou need to actually take CONTROL of your finances since she obviously can no longer be trusted with them.  She wants to accuse you of being controlling.  DO IT.\n\nPrediction:  If she keeps control of the money, she is going to run your lives into the ground, then complain that you don't make enough money, dump you and find a man who makes more.", "Nta 'no honey, I don't trust you bc you're running up our credit card behind my back, hiding purchases, and refusing to discuss it.  None of that is trust worthy behavior'\n\nYou absolutely need a budget. Everyone needs to know where their money goes.", "NTA, and it's time you ran a credit report.\n\nThat being said, she needs some personal spending money out of the family budget. Money that is set aside for a purse/ spa day/ whatever, it just can't be a free for all.", "Another option\n\nShe gets a job. Her pay check can go towards the cost of day care, a twice weekly  house cleaning service, and anything she wants to buy for herself.", "NTA: There is clearly more going on here though.  People don't just develop issues with moderation over night.  Either she has always been like this and you didn't notice until it started to impact you more, or this has been building for some time.  Ask why more, and maybe suggest therapy and healthier self care.  It seems odd that she jumped to financial abuse so quickly.", "back to work in 2 years hopefully! NTA", "Maxing out credit cards is not a little treat. A treat would be a fancy drink from Starbucks. We are talking thousands of dollars that is just not OK", "\"...she got defensive and accused me of not trusting her...\"\n\nBecause she has freely demonstrated that she is extremely UNtrustworthy.\n\nMaxing out secret credit cards? Oh my. You have a big BIG problem.\n\nNTA.", "I saw this suggestion on another post. Handle this like a group project. Put together a sheet showing what your monthly income is and log every single expense that is a must: rent/mortgage, car, utilities, gas, credit card payments, etc.  Let her know that of course she's worth having everything she wants, but there has to be a line so that you can save and provide for your children's futures, for family trips, and holidays, etc. \nMaybe if she sees it in black and white she'll understand this isn't coming from an opinion of what she's worth, this is just the facts of your current lifestyle.", " NTA, insist on couples therapy.", "Obviously, she is not happy and doesn\u2019t feel fulfilled. \nGiving in to a shopping addiction is one way to feel fulfilled, although very temporarily.\nShe could\u2019ve also had an affair, develop an eating disorder or a sports addiction. Anything to feel numb for a short but sweet amount of time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say: don\u2019t try to solve this superficially. There is way more to it than just financial ignorance \n\nShe feels worthless, she feels bored, she doesn\u2019t feel alive anymore and she isn\u2019t challenged to live her full potential\n\nA designer bag gives the feeling of being on top of your game,  it it wears out after a few hours or days. And then she needs more.\n\nMake all this the topic of your conversation \n\nDarling, how are you. What are you feeling. What makes you happy, what makes you sad, what would you like to change in your life, what would be your ideal living situation, perhaps get a job?\n\nCommunicate!\nHer shopping sprees are only a symptom of the problem that lies beneath\n\nAlso, if y\u00f3u\u2019re the one to tell her she can\u2019t buy these things anymore, she\u2019ll feel even smaller and worthless. Sh\u00e9 needs to be the one to figure out something else is going on and that spending her (and your) money this way is a waste \nShe needs to take ownership and the lead over \u2018getting better and stronger\u2019\nYou just have to be smart enough to make her realize what\u2019s going on\n\nNAH", "There is some reaaally good advice here, so I won\u2019t rehash it except to say ignore the \u201cdivorce\u201d preachers. \n\nReplyingForFriends gave a very good and thoughtful response, specifically about how we humans find fulfillment. Your wife feels something lacking, and she\u2019s plugging that hole with shopping. It\u2019s all about the oxytocin and dopamine. \n\nImma go with NAH but caution against adopting a hard \u201cthis is how it\u2019s going to be\u201d stance, as that\u2019s controlling and you are 50/50 partners in this relationship. At the same time, she has to be willing to yield ground, as well. \n\nInstead of dictating a system, ask her how much she thinks she needs and establish that as her budget. If it is unreasonable or untenable, show her why. Then negotiate something more workable. \n\nAnd for everyone else who\u2019s about to weigh in and say some version of \u201cIt\u2019s his money and she should go get a job,\u201d stuff that.

It's not controlling to put this in place. There should also be savings goals! And agreed-upon cash flows into accounts/buckets with purposes attached (home upgrades, travel, kids' education, retirements...). \n\nThe fact that she's resistant to it has deeper reasons. If you fundamentally trust her, then I think the two likeliest reasons are:\n\n* A lack of financial skills / education. The fact that she even considers maxing out credit cards - presumably, not paying them off every month - is pointing in the direction that there's a knowledge gap on how to handle money\n* Some deep-seated feeling of losing out that comes out in unexpected ways. Is she feeling, for example, that she's missing out on professional fulfillment? *Your* life may look to her as one of increasing responsibility, recognition and raises, and hers looks stagnating and losing out - is this possible?\n\nIn any event, my suggestion is to dig until you get to a common ground. This could be \"we both should have a budget for our fun spending\" or \"we acknowledge that we aren't on the same page, and need to figure out how to get on it\". Don't just translate your - justified! - anxiety over the spending getting out of hand into something one-sided such as \"setting boundaries with your own money\". Not until you've actually found she isn't trustworthy - maybe she isn't! But then it's divorce time, and you still think of her as great at what she does etc. \n\nSo get help. If you think it's mostly an education issue would she be amenable to learning more about how money is managed? Or both of you together, if you don't feel yourself 100% on top of it?

So what can you do?\n\nI think there should be a frugal period, with no unessential spending till the credit cards are paid off and savings restored.", "NTA. What you're describing is a common problem between couples when it comes to being on the same page financially. You're the grasshopper in the relationship. You write about working hard, wanting to save, build an emergency fund, and not be a slave to credit cards or living paycheck to paycheck. Your wife, unfortunately, is the ant. She has all the justifications in the world for putting your and your family's financial well being in jeopardy so she can have fun in the moment.\n\nOf course, none of her reasons hold water. You know this.\n\nYou two are going to have to get on the same financial page. Be the yin to the other's yang. As you suggested, a budget is vital. First order of business must be to get out credit card debt. Then CUT UP THE CARDS, literally (as she cannot be trusted as long as she has access to them). Try to position the budget as a spending plan, rather than a deprivation tool. Work one or two facials or massages into the monthly budget, if possible. But stress than basic household necessities and bills MUST take precedence. The sooner the bills are under control, the sooner she can begin to enjoy massages and whatnot without guilt or family stress.\n\nThe sad fact is your wife has DEMONSTRATED that you cannot trust her with your household finances. This mistrust is not a figment of your imagination. Please consider that couples divorce and quarrel primarily over money matters. Being in debt is stressful. Debt is enslaving.\n\nAnd the family financial meetings should occur at least once a month. For the present, put her on a cash basis. Once the cash is gone, her ability to spend is also curtailed. You're not being controlling or bossy or mean. It's a necessary step to preserve the financial security of your family for the long term.", "NTA. I\u2019m a SAHM to 3 kids, we share all the finances and we each get a personal spending allowance monthly. It\u2019s built into our budget. We also both have access to our excel sheet with all purchases itemized and can see at any time what is being spent in each category. Neither one of us makes major purchases without talking to the other.", "Being a SAHM is a privilege. Not an excuse to go wild with the plastic.\nNTA", "It's,  unfortunately,  common. I only know 2 women that are financially responsible.  I don't understand how people don't want to build a better life for themselves instead of living in the moment.", "NTA obviously she should not be in charge of finances anymore. And furthermore she should probably get a hobby so she doesn't derive her self worth from buying things", "NTA. If she's bored, she can get a job. Right now, she's a financial black hole, and those cards with her cut in half.", "I'm not saying she has a shopping addiction, but she's either near one or using those items as a coping mechanism.\n\nIt's completely unhealthy and she needs help. And if she doesn't want it you need a divorce before she bankrupts the family.", "nta. Limit what she has access to, and tell her if she wants more money she can get a job.", "NTA-- this kind of shit is what ruined my marriage too. My ex-wife was overspending and I had to foot major bills despite making significantly less money than her and then doing this repeatedly for an entire year making our finances suffer SEVERELY. And then she would repeatedly do it despite repeated conversations and plans of attack at the problem.", "she is telling from the family. Secretly maxing out credit cards is so financially stupid it is a deal breaker.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  With this sudden change in behavior I'd be concerned if a medical condition is behind it or if she has the beginnings of a shopping addiction.  If she won't you may have to open an account she can't access so she doesn't drive you into financial ruin.  Obviously don't keep it secret and you're a ways off from this.  But it may eventually become necessary.", "My step mother did this to my father. She was a stay at home mom. He had a savings account he\u2019d been putting away for a rainy day. She found out about it. Demanded that he she be put on the account. And used every gaslighting technique in the book to make him feel bad for not doing it. She blew through all 10K in 30 days.", "NTA. There's a huge difference between self care and annihilating your credit score. Your wife has a problem and a big attitude about that problem. She needs to acknowledge she has a problem and seek therapy to treat it; you both need couple's therapy to get through the attitude; and you need to document everything.", "NTA, she probably has a shopping addition, and needs a reality check on finances.", "NTA. Your wife is behaving terrribly. A good start would be to set up a new account for her (and yourself) where a predetermined amount of fun money goes. Than can be used without being accountable to the other person. Bills and emergency savings need to be sorted because any fun money is distributed.\n\nThe bigger problem is your wife\u2019s entitlement. You are right not to trust her at this point, if she\u2019s maxxing out your credit card and taking money out of savings for luxuries", "Dude. Your wife is being sooo manipulative and using the tactic of changing the issue when you bring up a valid concern. When she tries to change the focus of the argument, stay on track. Don't let her change the issue. You are so nice! My husband went ballistic when I ordered door dash twice a week and it didn't even jeopordize us financially in the least. He promptly made me delete all of his card info from all websites I used. He was super pissed.\n\nYour wife is ruining a good thing she has going.\n\nEDIT: I'm confused as to why she has total access of accounts if she doesn't pay for the bills. Me and all of my friends who are married have allowances for the month.", "I have seen this with family and friends several times and every time it\u2019s been about the spender feeling unfulfilled or not appreciated. Work life gives you a feeling of accomplishment and being appreciated for what you can offer. They pay you and give you reviews and the occasional WTG. Being a SAHP means there is always more work to do that very rarely do you get praised for. It\u2019s hard to feel you accomplished anything because the house gets dirty again immediately, kids need fed AGAIN, and nobody says good job cleaning that bathroom. You don\u2019t even get a paycheck. \n\nYour wife may not realize consciously that this is why she is overspending and is getting defensive. Make this about making a plan together for a budget. She does need some fun money but it should be reasonable. \n\nYou also have to address the underlying issues. Do things to make her feel appreciated. Maybe she needs to return to work to feel accomplished. \n\nNTA but think about the best way to get her on board with spending a whole lot less.", "Maybe you should think about getting a separate account that she can't touch since she wants to be sneaky? Or put your foot down in some type of way where she gets it and changes her ways. Maybe therapy would help..maybe she is bored and feeling like she has no purpose so she's spending more? Who knows but my point is, you both need to get to the bottom of why she's all of a sudden doing this and take necessary measures to get back on track to feeling secure with your finances for sure.", "NTA I think yoir reasoning is sound but you may need to just investigate her EMOTIONAL needs and if they are being met because this may be the result of something you have overlooked or did not fully consider that is causing her to spend like this. She is dead fucking wrong absolutely, but if you want to work this out, probably investigate how shes feeling and things, and ask her what shes needing from you so the underlying REAL issue can be resolved. You may be surprised.", "Very important to document EVERYTHING (e.g. email a daily diary to yourself of your concerns, her secret spending, & your discussions). You have kids & financial issues, which can get very messy very quickly.\n\nThere will be a lot of heresay if anything goes wrong, but having a time-stamped written record will go a long way to protecting you against any future accusations of financial control/abuse (especially as she's already accused you of it).\n\nI really hope you can resolve whatever underlying issues are there, prepare for the worst & hope for the best.", "NTA. My 1st thought was: new, wealthy friend, and she's trying to \"keep up with the Jones's\".", "She seems bored, empty, and isolated. Help her find fulfillment/dopamine fixes in a more healthy way.", "OP needs to cancel the cards and keep the one's that aren't maxed out under lock and key.\n\nHe's basically screwed already though. He really needs to nip this in the bud right now.", "I'm so sorry that this is looking like where OP is headed. \n\nNTA\n\nIt's \"financial abuse\" when you spend every dollar and cent to ruin without a care in the world, because for you, the cash appears magically like that quarter from the tooth fairy, or that PS5 for Thursday. \n\nThe moment you try to really pull back control of the finances so you don't crash into the side of a mountain, you might need to put an exorcist, accountant, therapist, and probably a divorce attorney on high speed dial.", "The manic features of bipolar are more likely to cause impulsive and excessive spending than the depressive ones. But that doesn't change your underlying message.", "I\u2019m a SAHM and agree with this 100%. I do wonder how he never noticed any of the purchases until he saw the bill. If her spending is this out of control it seems like he would have noticed multiple new bags? Clothes? Hairstyles? Nails? \nDude needs to look at his wife once in awhile and tell her she is looking pretty. That the new bag is awesome. And that outfit is banging. Might help with that lonely and empty feeling that she is trying to fill with shopping and the compliments she is most likely getting elsewhere if she were noticed at home.", "I still don't see how all this excuses the wife from being an AH when she has been hiding all this spending, then calling him controlling and then accusing him of not trusting her.", "I think too it would be a good idea to ask her if she would like to put the kids in daycare. Either part time so she can have days to herself, or full time. Maybe she would like to go back to paid work? Something that would feel fulfilling to her.", ">Instead of dictating a system, ask her how much she thinks she needs and establish that as her budget. If it is unreasonable or untenable, show her why. Then negotiate something more workable.\n\nLook at her previous actions. She will just call him controlling or try to put blame on him.\n\nI don't see how she isn't an AH but then again, this is AITA judging a conflict between a husband and a wife so I'm not surprised", "Well she's also buying spa treatments. She's probably just bored and spending too much time on social media", "Heresy = against a religion's teachings.\n\nHearsay = pretty much in the name: saying what's been heard, so not hard evidence.\n\nHeresay = saying what's here?", "This and make sure you don\u2019t use a work email; personal and consider setting up a new account that is not automatically logged in/ password saved anywhere.", "Group therapy explaining that a divorce is incoming might wake her up", "He needs to be careful though. Cutting off his wife vs. divorcing her, have different financial consequences depending on the state they live in.", "Very well put!", "She doesn't sound bipolar. She sounds spoiled and selfish. Bipolar spending would be way more pronounced.", "Dude. Growing up everyone I knew shopped a shit ton. All you need to do is hide it in the trunk and add piece by piece slowly into your closet. \n\nI don't think giving her the out of feeling unnoticed is fair to OP. I don't like to make sweeping judgments about men but my husband at least doesn't notice any new clothes, hairstyles, or hair color. Every time I point it out he says, \"Yeah, I thought something was different\".\n\nI feel an aversion to the idea of blaming OP for your proposed reason on why she is spending money and worse, why you somewhat suggest it's justified. She fucked up, plain and simple. You can't blame someone else for your lame actions.", "Psychology 101. She found something that gives her self worth a small kick up. She doesn't want to lose it and throws some accusations at the wall in the hope that some stick and she can continue. Addicted people act the same way, whatever you say to keep the addiction going. Nobody is taking the mumble of a drunk serious either.\n\nThat is what the post meant. She is hurt for some reason and he should have the aspiration and willingness to look through smoke and mirrors. People are not robots and not every behavior is done in malice.", "Following their logic, you can't be upset with an alcoholic spouse or a drug addicted spouse, or a kleptomaniac spouse because they're addicted to the behavior.", "Thank you for your contribution to this discussion", "> She doesn't want to lose it and throws some accusations at the wall in the hope that some stick and she can continue.\n\nNot an AH move in the context of AITA?", "Thank you for your username. It made me chuckle."]}
