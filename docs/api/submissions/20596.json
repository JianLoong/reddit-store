I asked her out on a date and she said yes. She asked if for the date we could drive separately to the restaurant. No worries.\n\n The date: I show up 15 minutes early and she is already there. I go to give her a hug, let her know she looks stunning, and then ask the hostess if we could be seated a little early for our table for 2. She informs me that she changed the reservation and she had invited her friend Karley (35F). Turns out she had called and changed the reservation from 2 people to 3. I could also tell that Karley felt uneasy and was not informed about the restaurant as she was a little dressed down for the place. \n\nI try to have a conversation with Emma, but she has her head in her phone and keeps her replies short. I look at Karley and she just looks like she wants to do anything but be here. We order drinks and appetizers then Emma leaves to go to the bathroom. Karley turns to me and apologizes. She lets me know she had no idea this was supposed to be a date. She was just told to get in the car and Emma was taking her to dinner. I ask her if Emma does this kinda thing regularly and Karley says kinda.

I had a blast talking to Karley and just kept at it. After the meal arrived, about 20 minutes after sitting down, I stopped trying to get Emma to talk with us and focused on Karley. \n\nI pay for dinner and hand my number to Karley.

I was skeptical and ready to say you were with the title, but context changes everything. She invited a friend on the date, which is understandable if she was nervous - but then completely ignored you and showed no interest. Karley aside, it would have been an awful date. Emma\u2019s interest in you only seemed to pique after you gave Karley your number. Meh. You probably would have never heard from her again anyway.", "NTA and good luck for a future with Karley!

Well done!", "NTA you were on a date. Emma apparently wasn\u2019t. At that point you\u2019re just another guy in the restaurant who was talking to a nice girl. Hope it works out with Karley!", "NTA. You had me in the first half but yeah ... definitely NTA.", "NTA, Emma is on a major power trip and probably is the dominant friend that uses Karley to feel good about herself. I hope Karley calls you back and doesn\u2019t give in to Emma. That was really great of you to recognize there was another amazing woman there who you connected with.

NTA\n\nEmma basically avoided all evening long and brought a third wheel without telling you beforehand... Which is apparently a recurrent thing for her... At this point, calling things off on your part is totally warranted. Now, is asking someone else on a date at the same time an AH move? Kinda, but...
