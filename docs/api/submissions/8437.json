I as a mother would worry about it, i have seen kids who where raised vegetarian with iron and vit B12 deficiency, which caused extreme exhaustion and brain fog, while if they where supplemented with these vitamins and minerals it wouldn't have come to that.\n\nBut once again, younger years it's about balance, the moment they are old enough to speak for themselves you can accommodate to the diet they prefer.

We eat tons of meat, eggs, dairy gets included, minimal simple vegetables and we don\u2019t eat any processed foods, grains, sugars etc. it\u2019s our preference and it\u2019s how we have learned, as 30 something\u2019s, our bodies feel their best. That said, in no way am I going to force this on our child. I intend on him being exposed to a lot of food and options so as he gets older he can make his own choices. He\u2019ll try meats and dairy, vegetables and fruit, healthy grains. I think the only thing we won\u2019t be giving him is processed junk food. Sweets, fruit snacks, etc. if he has those things later as he grows up, fine, it just won\u2019t be in our home. That said, I don\u2019t think raising your kid vegetarian is wrong I just think you\u2019re not allowing him the option of figuring out what Whole Foods he likes and doesn\u2019t like, and I think kids need meat (my own biased opinion) so I think he\u2019s missing out on a lot of nutrients.", "Yes!!! \ud83e\udd95 \ud83e\udd96 \ud83d\ude02", "My daughter is 15 months old LoL she doesn't have a preference. When she's old enough to make this choices then I don't have a problem with that. This Ladies kid is 3, also not old enough to make that choice.", "I don\u2019t know how to edit \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f sheet should be curry no idea how it turned into sheet.", "I understand where you are coming from trying to go along wit someone else\u2019s thing is hard trust I go through it wit mine on eating pork I don\u2019t they do on occasion my comment was towards what the story was about u agreed on it when u guys were together but now that u aren\u2019t u want to from my perspective it sounded bitter if it wasn\u2019t I do apologize if you talk to him he def gonna want him to be a vegetarian cuz that\u2019s what he believes ur baby has been one all this time it may make him sick if he changes his diet honestly being a vegetarian not really bad thing wit everything going on wit this chicken epidemic I might consider being one fully", "Oh man I love the drama of AITA! Also how the title is often so misleading. \u201cAITA for kicking a dog?\u201d Turns out it was a stuffed dog blocking the only exit of a burning building \ud83d\ude02", "Well yeah of course, but it's not like he's going from never having eaten animal protein to a sudden onset of it.\n\nI wonder if animal milk proteins are metabolized in the same way? Like if a vegetarian who drank cow milk starts eating meat again, would their body process the meat more easily than a vegan who started eating meat again?", "I second this. I was raised vegetarian but told I ever wanted meat I could eat it but it wouldn\u2019t be bought or prepared for me. I\u2019m really grateful for it. My personal ethics mean I have chosen to stay vegetarian and would be upset at this point to have eaten animals growing up.\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t think the default thinking should be eat meat until you choose not. If eating meat is immoral/unethical then allow your child to make that choice when they\u2019re old enough, not the other way round.", "She said he\u2019s already been asking and expressed interest.. also 3 year olds definitely know what they like and don\u2019t like.", "Lmfao right? I did think yours was gonna be more of a spite thing. I was pleasantly surprised.", "How does a 3 yr old make a huge choice like that? Especially when he's never had it? And doesn't understand the implications of it? Not only that, but if he's never had meat, all of a sudden eating it could make him very sick.", "I go by \u201cparents job to decide what is offered, kids job too decide what to eat\u201d and up until now meat hasn\u2019t been offered. \n\nWhy would you be mad? Because he had agreed to it,  because you think it\u2019s what\u2019s best for your daughter, because the idea of meat grosses you out? Something else?", "Because we made an agreement. I don't eat meat because I hate the idea of eating other living things. If my daughter gets older, truely understands where meat comes from and makes the choice to eat them, THEN it's her choice. If I had been given the choice as a kid then I would have chosen not to eat meat."]}
