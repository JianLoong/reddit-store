I as a mother would worry about it, i have seen kids who where raised vegetarian with iron and vit B12 deficiency, which caused extreme exhaustion and brain fog, while if they where supplemented with these vitamins and minerals it wouldn't have come to that.\n\nBut once again, younger years it's about balance, the moment they are old enough to speak for themselves you can accommodate to the diet they prefer.

He\u2019ll try meats and dairy, vegetables and fruit, healthy grains. I think the only thing we won\u2019t be giving him is processed junk food. Sweets, fruit snacks, etc. if he has those things later as he grows up, fine, it just won\u2019t be in our home. That said, I don\u2019t think raising your kid vegetarian is wrong I just think you\u2019re not allowing him the option of figuring out what Whole Foods he likes and doesn\u2019t like, and I think kids need meat (my own biased opinion) so I think he\u2019s missing out on a lot of nutrients.", "Yes!!! \ud83e\udd95 \ud83e\udd96 \ud83d\ude02", "My daughter is 15 months old LoL she doesn't have a preference.

My personal ethics mean I have chosen to stay vegetarian and would be upset at this point to have eaten animals growing up.\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t think the default thinking should be eat meat until you choose not.

I don't eat meat because I hate the idea of eating other living things. If my daughter gets older, truely understands where meat comes from and makes the choice to eat them, THEN it's her choice. If I had been given the choice as a kid then I would have chosen not to eat meat.", "NAH. Food I think should be a choice and certainly I\u2019ve shifted my eating preferences over the years. This is a reasonable time to reconsider whether you should have to cook vegetarian for your son when it\u2019s just the two of you and you feel like chicken. Definitely this is something to discuss with your ex. I do think it would be helpful to try to get your ex to deeply consider why he is vegetarian and why he wants that for his child. It\u2019ll help you make smart decisions. \n\nMy girls (6 years apart in age) both announced at age 14 they wanted to go vegetarian, and they\u2019ve been defending that decision to family and friends and enduring teasing ever since. The oldest had vegan friends at summer camp and ate with them daily - she has somewhat disordered eating so rules around food appealed to her and she realized she didn\u2019t miss meat at all. I decided the best plan was to be supportive and made vegetarian versions of our food for her thinking it would last a few weeks (it\u2019s been over 15 years). She now feels strongly against eating meat or fish due to animal cruelty, and can be awkward about her views in public. She doesn\u2019t preach a lot but absolutely will not touch meat under any circumstances even if that comes across as rude. Younger sis was influenced by her sister and also gave up meat without exactly knowing why. At age 18 she decided she needed to make her own food ethics decisions and took a nutrition class just before Covid hit. What she learned about eating in general and her own body led her to decide to go fully vegan for health reasons, and to cut both gluten as well. Since we were all home together bored and grocery stores were having supply issues we agreed to go on that journey together.  She challenged herself to find delicious vegan recipes and TBH it was a lot less painful than we expected. Even vegan holiday feasts were fun - without a Turkey or Lasagna. It did help my daughter\u2019s inflammation and she just felt better. My arthritis flared less and I lost weight. Even though I entered this reluctantly I have mostly stuck with it. I do break down for cream cheese on baked potatoes and will sometimes eat meat when I go out. Both I and my youngest have added fish and eggs back into our diets because they are healthy and help us feel good - and we are doing this mostly for health reasons. We will eat small amounts of meat as guests if not doing so will upset the hostess of an event. My oldest has kept strict vegan because she doesn\u2019t like poultry farms and thinks it\u2019s cruel to eat even fish that eat other fish. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: the way to approach this may vary depending on why your spouse is so entrenched in vegetarianism. Also, it won\u2019t be long before \u201cyou don\u2019t eat pepperoni\u201d isn\u2019t going to satisfy your son. You and your exhusband will need to have a few long discussions about this with him but regardless of what is said eventually your son will need to make up his own mind about what he would like to eat and what he believes is morally right and healthy. If he wants meat he will eat it outside the home even if you aren\u2019t serving it. As an adult he will make his own choices. \n\nI guess having a conversation about this now with you is phase 1 of the process of letting the kid eventually make his own choices. It should give you a good view of what will be said to your son later about WHY he shouldn\u2019t eat meat and how flexible he can be.", "I'd say:\n\"Our house, our food, our rules\" - worked out as a couple.\n\"My house, my food, my rules\" - kid eats what the parent eats at that parent's house.\nLet him live with both types of diet and decide later what he likes best.", "NTA.\n\nSame situation with me. I'm vegan and my ex is not. Our son is autistic so getting him to eat anything is a struggle. I do not limit him at all. He eats meat with dad and back at my house it's a vegetarian diet (he eats dairy). \n\nThe difference I guess, is that I never wanted my son to be vegan/vegetarian. He was as a toddler, he hated the texture of meat. Now he likes it. I just don't want to have to cook it. But he has designated things that he eats at dad's, and at mine.", "As someone who has leaned towards being vegetarian myself I don\u2019t think you are the AH. You are coparenting not married and for better or for worse you have to adhere to your lifestyle.\n\nIt\u2019s asking a bit much now, to expect to cook only vegetarian for your son who is too little to care.\n\nBut I also will say, one you need to work this out now. Because custody court could get nasty.\n\nBut also, I simply don\u2019t agree with force raising children pure vegetarian just because the parents are. Obviously you can often meet or exceeds most nutritional needs being vegetarian, but it\u2019s hard work and it\u2019s limiting a child in a meat oriented world. Plus, frankly, it\u2019s expensive and can be time consuming in multiple regards.\n\nYour ex is now asking you to finance the vegetarian cost groceries aside from your own, utilize a lot of time to cook them especially if they are separate from your meals, make sure they are nutritionally dense enough for a growing child, and that doesn\u2019t even delve into what your coparenting looks like when exposed to outside meals.\n\nThat would be a hard no for me. My personal opinion of you want it, is feed children as reasonably as healthy as can be afforded and to suit their nutritional needs, but ultimately not limit them and allow them to make their own choices as they get older. If you want to cook vegetarian meals occasionally I think that\u2019s a good compromise, but a hardcore vegetarian is probably not going to agree. That\u2019s not really your issue. And I\u2019ll be real, science shows early exposure CAN prevent allergies. By choosing to limit your child to exposure, you could be potentially setting them up for food allergies.", "My aunt and uncle had a similar approach when they split up. My aunt would cook whatever, since she had no food restrictions and when their son was at dad's house there was veggie food on the table.\n\nIf son wanted something the other parent usually made, the other parent was informed and usually agreed to make said food as welcome home meal for son.\n\nWorked fine for everyone involved.\n\nNTA.

I didn't love that he came home with a bit of a belly ache every time but it was such a small thing in the bigger picture that I didn't sweat it \n\nI'm more of a flexitarian now, that kid is 27 and is very much an omnivore with an appreciation for good vegetarian meals.", "[deleted]", "Honestly what I am hearing is that it would benefit YOU and YOUR family.

Which to me is different than offering and letting him decide (which is what we do with fish and he almost always decides not to eat it). (I wanted fish to be an option mainly because of allergies). I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to not let young kids decide if they want to eat meat or not, I think it\u2019s ok/appropriate for parents to be in charge of that choice as long as they are keeping the kids health in mind. I didn\u2019t have an issue with our son being vegetarian until we separated and it is more because it is difficult for me than because I think it is wrong or bad for my son.

The split up to me doesn\u2019t change how you want to fundamentally raise your child. This is a joint decision that both of you need to make and by saying oh he can eat vegetarian at your house but not my house isn\u2019t a compromise- that\u2019s making your child not a vegetarian which might not be a big deal to some but might be for others. \n\nI\u2019m a vegetarian and that would be a very big deal for me - I am one for ethical reasons and I would not want my child eating meat (until they are old enough to decide for themselves - by that I mean understand why I choose to be one not just a 6 year saying I want a burger) again this is me and it would be a big deal for me.

I understand that\u2019s it\u2019s harder if it\u2019s not what you do/believe in but it\u2019s similar to wanting your child raised in a certain faith or with certain values - it\u2019s a joint decision and each parent should support the best they can if they made that decision together. \n\nYou seem pretty open minded and willing to look at all the options so I would just have a conversation but also know that this isn\u2019t just food for him - it\u2019s not oh I don\u2019t want my kid eating junk food or etc. for some people it\u2019s such a huge part of their belief system.", "Wbta if you don't have a conversation with dad first.

You are also making choices for your children, and influencing their view of what is normal. It's fine, it's our job as parents to raise our children the way we think is right and to follow our own morals. But just because eating meat is the norm, and being vegetarian is not, that doesn't mean a child raised vegetarian is being influenced any more than a child raised to eat meat.\n\nIf you went to a party and there were cheese pizzas, pepperoni pizzas, and pizzas with meat made from human babies on it, would you let your 3 year old eat it because it's his choice and you don't want to influence him? Or would you tell him not to because it doesn't align with your own morals and he's not old enough to make an *informed* choice?", "Sure, but it I think the best choice is to offer them as much as is reasonably possible, and try to curb reasonably unhealthy things while explaining why. \n\nThe big difference here imo, because eating or not eating meat can be healthy or unhealthy is that, a lot of people DO eat meat. So they are much more likely to encounter meat options and those who eat it. In this case, if you allow meat, you can still make it healthy, you can still make vegetarian foods and you can still teach them why someone might not eat meat or not eat it in certain ways.\n\nThat\u2019s why I kind of tried to compare it to children who can\u2019t have soda but see children drinking it. The difference to me however is that meat does have healthy proteins but can be unhealthy over all, unlike say soda. But like meat, they are likely to exposed to many families that allow it.\n\nLike i said, I think teaching children to eat healthy is most import first. But I don\u2019t think restricting their diet there after is best. Excluding solely unhealthy foods is good for the most part and teaching them why is important, but I don\u2019t think completely disallowing it will work in your favor. \n\nWhether it\u2019s meat or soda (one is healthier than the other imo) I think it\u2019s better to try and reduce most instances of them consuming it with you, explain why and allow it as a treat or a decision, depending on the circumstance. But to completely cut something out, makes it likely that your child will still experience it, and then decide on their own when they are old enough that they want it finally now.\n\nAnd the biggest issue I see there is a parent who doesn\u2019t want their child to drink soda might be unhappy, a vegetarian parent who strictly wants their kid to not eat meat may react very badly to their child deciding they want it. When instead they could have simply tried to import their reasons and let the kid decide for themselves.\n\nBecause fact of the matter is, whatever you do.
