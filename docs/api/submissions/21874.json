Anyway, he thinks I am being inconsiderate.\n\nI asked why it even matters, because he knows his (adult) son is dating. Why is hearing about it at work a problem?

I doubt he has either.\n\n his request makes no sense.", "NTA. You\u2019re free to talk about your life with whoever you want. If he doesn\u2019t like it he can go somewhere else.", "NTA. My co workers always discuss their weekend and/social lives. No one is discussing sex, just recapping what went on.\n\nYou\u2019ve been very respectful not to mention your relationship with the dad.\n\nHonestly, my husband and I met at work and 25 years later still work there (different departments). There have been numerous marriages that started at our very large workplace. No issues because we are all adults. (Save for one of the managing partners having an affair with the office admin;) THAT didn\u2019t end well though his part has been swept under the rug and she moved jobs.", "NTA...He's the one with the problem here. Many workplaces have moments when people talk about their private life, and I would say colleagues partners and their names are common knowledge. If that's the conversation going around your workplace, you shouldn't have to keep quiet because it happens to be his son.", "NTA. You didn't mention anything that involved your co-worker's life. You only said about yourself and your boyfriend. He needs to understand that you kept it at a level where it's not too much revealing. Why is he making it a big deal?   \n\n\nI would  speak with a supporting person or HR on the safe side, if things are not comfortable with his behavior. That way you have someone to talk with when necessary.", "> I've never mentioned this to any of our coworkers. I doubt he has either.\n\nInfo: So you tell your coworkers that you spent your weekends with your boyfriend. Do your coworkers know that your boyfriend is his son? From what you said I would guess they don't.\n\nSo the dad just does not like to hear what his son has been up to in his spare time. And maybe he is scared they would find out that he has a son who is gay, because he could not cope with that. As seemingly he himself is not able to cope with the fact that his son is gay.\n\nThat is absolutely his problem. Just ignore him. You have every right to chat with people about your leisure time, especially when you were asked. You're right, if he doesn't want to hear it, he has to leave.\n\nOh, NTA, obviously.", "NTA.  So you have to not talk about your boyfriend so he doesn't hear about it?  Who cares?  It makes 0 sense that dad is uncomfortable with this conversation.  All you say is what you did over the weekend.  It's your business, not his.  And you're right, he can walk away if it bothers him so much.  You have the right to discuss whatever personal information you choose to disclose to your coworkers.  Dad is being an AH & for no good reason.", "NTA - it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re talking about anything too personal or intimate. It does sound a bit like your boyfriend\u2019s dad is homophobic?", "NTA for talking about your life to your coworkers if you're comfortable doing so.  With that said, I certainly wouldn't go out of your way to highlight the fact that your bf is this particular coworker's son.  Coworker is allowed to want to keep his personal life separate from work, but he can't extend that rule to you & limit what you're allowed to say.", "NAH. You can talk about it with coworkers but I get where he is coming from. I also love to keep work and home separate. Many of my coworkers don't even know I'm married and have a child (although I do wear a ring). It's just a weird dynamic for some people. Id respect his wishes but no one is wrong here. It's not something we'd normally expect without being told", "I guess NAH.\n\nSeems like a very reasonable request...I feel like most people think its common to not talk about romantic relationships in professional workplace environments, but I guess if its important to you and your other coworkers/boss don't have a problem with it, then you are within your right to continue doing so.", "NTA.   If you were dating a man other than his son, would he have said the same thing?  And what if you were dating his daughter?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely a HIM problem.", "NAH. When you work with family  this is the down side, especially if family dates where they work. I had a mom and her two sons as employees once. Their mentality was that each one ceased being mom or brother when they stepped through the doors, and were coworkers. They kept it totally professional and that's what Dad needs to do too. He doesn't have to hear what you are talking about, but maybe try to not be loud about it so that he can't listen in unless he tries.", "really the only way to avoid talking about it would be mentinoning that particular worker does not want to hear about his son's relationship, so it makes it harder for him.  \n\n\ni guess you could refer to him as homophobic and don't want to talk around him, that would keep his personal life out of work\n\nNTA", "NTA - If all you are saying is a passing mention of \u201cwe went to the movies\u201d \u2014that\u2019s not a TMI diatribe about your sex life or the argument you had. Your bf\u2019s dad has issues though\u2026so while I would avoid the topic around him, maybe a chat with HR to make them aware might be a good idea just to cover your a$$ if he tries to start drama.\nEdited to add: wonder if Daddy isn\u2019t attracted to you and jealous of his son\u2026", "NAH. Neither of you are right, neither of you are wrong. Some people prefer to keep their work and home life separate, whereas others are happy blending the two.\n\nIs your BF's dad higher in the organization? The only reason why I ask is that my dad was in the C-suite of big financial institution. My sister was a branch teller, but she applied and was hired under her married name. His reason for keeping their identities separate is that A) he wanted no cries of nepotism and B) people can get really, really weird about stuff like this.\n\nAfter a surprise inspection at my sister's branch, where my dad's co-worker let it slip that she was his daughter, her manager got really super weird, weirder than before. He was kind of a toady sucking up to the higher ups and ignoring the front line. Once he found that his employee was the daughter of C-level, she said he went from ignoring her to fawning over her. She much preferred being ignored and transferred to another location. \n\nJust food for thought.", "NTA it would be N A H IF you were out there saying \"oh i went to lunch with such and suchs son then ti the movies with him\" but you said most likely don't even know the connection between the two of you. Honestly I think it sounds like the dad has the hots for you and/or another female in the work place and wants to appear young and available and you talking about his son makes him feel old and unavailable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
