I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but he doesn\u2019t want custody, he just doesn\u2019t want to look bad for not having it. Your father should not be obsessed with your weight, and he absolutely should not be letting his girlfriend of ONE YEAR yell at you. Just no, some random woman has no right to call you any names just because your dad is dating her. Go live with your mom, who knows how to show you love.

Anyone comes knocking to try to bring you back (some authority or whatnot) tell them you don't feel safe at your dad's house, tell them he is emotionally abusing you and you're scared of him. Never change that story, repeat it like a mantra if you're asked \"He's abusing me and I'm scared of him.\" \n\nYou dad is an AH and most likely a narcissist who's trying every card he's got to manipulate you to remain his punching bag. Don't let him. My mother is a narcissist and it took me 20 years to realise all the abuse she'd done to me, you're 14 and already know you dad is abusive. If your relatives from your dad gives you a hard time you have a few options: 1. Block them. 2. Ask them if they're telling you to put up with abuse? Do they want you to be abused? Do they want you dad to hurt you? Don't let them try to rugsweep it either. Personally I'd tell you to just block them and move on 'cause you're only a kid and shouldn't have to deal with this. But, if you want to see them scramble like cockroaches out of the light use the other option. It might shut them up 'cause they won't like being called out on their bullshit. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA he is no father, he's a sperm donor who bullies children and uses people like props.

Any time a parent hears the kid is unhappy with the kid-parent relationship and their conclusion is that *the kid is the problem*, it \u2014proves\u2014 how much the parent is the asshole. Most of these parents never come around. If you continue to engage on this topic for the next 40 years with him, he might still be incapable of thinking it was him all along.

Best luck.", "nta, your mom can petition the court for full custody and i believe when you are 13 or older you can tell the judge who you want to live with. Tell dad \"if only you had been a better dad. How do you like them apples?\"", "NTA!!! The same exact thing happened with my ex-dad, my age and all. Mine went a little farther and said he would straight up off himself if I \u201ccared so little about having him in my life\u201d. It was a complete lie and I knew it, so I refused to back down. Your \u201cdad\u201d refused to act like a proper, supportive father for most if not all of your life. As a result, he\u2019s lost his right to have a child, my respect, and should lose everyone else\u2019s respect, too. You\u2019re going to be so much better off without him, and you\u2019ll hopefully be surprised at how little you think about him in your future. I\u2019m much older now and I\u2019m so grateful I made it extremely clear I wanted to go no contact with my ex-dad whatsoever.\n\nMore advice, I guess since your life sounds a LOT like mine: NEVER forget how he makes you feel right now. Write things down if it isn\u2019t painful. Screenshot your post and keep it safe. NEVER forget the terrible things he may say or do. You will forget how bad it really was. REMEMBER THIS ALWAYS: YOU DO NOT WANT TO RECONNECT, EVER. He will always do more harm than good. Ignore the people that even remotely take his side. Remember who the people that side with him are, since they might give information about you to him. If you\u2019re petty like me, stop calling him \u201cdad\u201d and call him by his first name, since he lost that title. :P\n\nMy ex-dad periodically reaches out with some sob story about how he misses me, how he hates me, how he just wants to be a good father, etc\u2026 I never reply, since that\u2019s the most fulfilling response. From what I\u2019ve heard, my ex-dad has only become even worse to a frightening, obsessive degree. Leave your \u201cdad\u201d and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. I feel terrible for you. My oldest went through this with her dad. She left at age 10. She hasn't spoken to him in 7 years now and she's happier, kinder, and her anxiety is so much better.

But based on the information we have about the dad he would\u2019ve taken the kids in during the divorce to keep his \u201cgood guy\u201d act up. So you can either call the mum evil for being petty and keeping the daughter while homeless or you can call the dad a good guy for keeping the daughter away from a toxic home life.
