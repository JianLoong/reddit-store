Anyway the work is fun and rewarding and that's what I focus on.\n\nI stopped drinking at the start of this year just because. No religious, health or addiction reasons.

I also have a 1 year old so I'm sure psychologically that had something to do with it.\n\nBack to the holiday party. Everyone was drinking and having a great time. I was mingling and talking to everyone too but got asked MULTIPLE times why I'm not drinking and got comments like \"Oh cmon just 1, don't be a spoilsport etc\". I just let it go because people were pretty buzzed. \n\nThen my manager comes over with a drink which she said was non-alcoholic.  She's actually one of the more normal ones so I took her at face value and had a couple of sips. Very quickly realized it was alcohol and then they all laughed and said \"haha gotcha \" and \"see it didn't kill ya\" and shit like that.  I was pissed off and asked why they did that, very calmly but with a straight face.  I was then told to 'lighten up' and have some fun and that it's not a big deal. Someone called me an asshole as well for making a big deal out of it.\n\nI haven't brought it up since but I'm curious to know if I was justified in being upset.

Then comes the smell.  Then the taste.  It would either be set aside or dumped out.  Sorry, I said I don't care for alcohol.\n\nStrangers just don't seem to get it though.  I like making them squirm though.  If they don't take no for an answer, I then tell them my reason why I don't drink.  My mother was a severe alcoholic, I don't drink.  Usually leaves them standing there like a deer in headlights.  They take a moment, go \"oh\", then walk somewhere else.", "I'd have freaked out and been like \"Oh my God! I just got my 1 year chip from AA and now I have to start all over!\" just to see the look on their faces.\nOP, you are definitely NTA.", "NTA.of course. \n\nI quit drinking for kind of similar reasons to you. The only medical reason was that I have pretty severe insomnia and I found that even one drink impacted my sleep cycles. \n\nThe pressure to drink socially through work is unbelievable. And I work with pretty cool people. \n\nThere was one day that we were at a kind of fancy thing at a hotel which included wines with each course. I very discreetly said to the waiter \"I don't drink\" so that he wouldn't pour me any.  He replied back very loudly \"would you like to start?\" Like, dude! For all you know I'm an alcoholic. It was so uncomfortable. \n\nAnyways, your coworkers are idiots.", "I would be so mad! What if you were pregnant and not telling people early?! Or if alcohol interferes with your medication? That\u2019s so dangerous!", "YTA. Not because you don't drink, but because you started some drama. You could have easily just set the drink down and walked away from it.", "NTA, this is the kind of shit people who don't drink deal with all the time. I know because I often don't drink just because I don't feel like it, and even when I do I rarely have more than the one drink before switching to something non-alcoholic, and half of my close family just don't drink because they don't like the taste.", "NTA, one way to avoid this (I\u2019m sorry you may need this\ud83d\ude1e). Get a Sprite or seltzer and act like it has alcohol\u2026 bartenders tend to understand and will help it look alcoholic but not! However, I don\u2019t think you should have to but might be easier in some cases? If you choose to not drink and say no, they are arses for pushing and deceiving you! I\u2019d start looking for another job, but that can take time so just provided ways to avoid that in future. (I want to emphasize- I don\u2019t condone or approve what OPs coworkers did! It was despicable and disrespectful and wrong!, I\u2019m just providing ideas to get through until they decide to leave) Sometimes we just have to survive\u2026", "NTA there are medications that have bad interactions with alcohol, you could\u2019ve been a recovering alcoholic\u2026 there are any number of reasons why what they did could\u2019ve had a very detrimental effect on your life and health.

How can you ever trust people again who would think this was okay?", "NTA at all. I drink, but I\u2019m not a big drinker, andI often don\u2019t want to drink the others are. The best way to deal with it is to constantly have a non-alcoholic drink that looks like any other cocktail, like soda water with lime.", "NTA -If you are in the US that can be considered assault and get jail time for it if they do it once they will again file a police report.", "Where are you located? I'm an Aussie, and we have a dreadful drinking culture here. \n\nYou're NTA by a mile! It doesn't matter WHY you don't drink. It is none of work's business. The fact is, they crossed a boundary. In what universe is it okay to give someone a drug (and alcohol IS a drug) when that person does not want it? \n\nMaybe have a meeting with HR and send a group email to these ass-clowns asking them why it was important to them that you have a drink? Make them have a look at themselves.\n\nEven if a member of HR was in on this so-called 'hilarity', is there soemone else at work to whom you can speak? Is there maybe a governing body to whom you could complain about the behaviour. It is so wrong, and I am furious for you.", "NTA. If this happened to me, I would speak with a lawyer and then HR. In that order. Incredibly poor judgment on manager\u2019s part, which may even constitute a criminal offence. Do what\u2019s right for you. I\u2019m sorry this happened.", "Ask them if they think roofies are ok", "NTA although this happened at a holiday party that is still a reportable offense. Go to HR and report her, this was a work function and she was definitely not acting in a way that shows the company in the best light. If you don't feel you can go to HR  take it to a lawyer instead.", "NTA at all. Surely that has to be a legal violation. Apart from being legally wrong it seems like just a shitty think to do. Respect people's decisions please", "NTA.  They were all out of line.  They have no idea if you're a recovering alcoholic, on a medication (temporary or long-term) that does not mix with alcohol, or get an upset stomach with alcohol.  You had every right to be mad.  Talk to your boss at the office and tell them that you're on a alcohol cleanse (or whatever excuse you want to make) and did not appreciate being fooled/bullied into drinking and felt completely disrespected by them and your colleagues for not respecting your boundaries.\n\nIf you're ever in a similar situation again, you could always just hold a half empty glass of alcohol in your hand and pretend to drinking it throughout the party/event to avoid the attention.", "NTA. That's exceedingly unethical and probably a criminal offense in your area. I could forgive a frat boy for doing that because they genuinely don't know much, but older adults should understand there are serious reasons not to drink like religion, health, medication interactions, addiction, etc. \n\nAnd even they got purely lucky and none of those applied, it's still unethical to ever put something into someone's body without their informed consent. I would never trick a vegan who is against honey into eating it even though I think that's an insane, mockable position. I'd tell them to their face their opinion is stupid and laughable, but I'd never ever trick them into violating it.", "put some acid in his coffee", "NTA. They sound like a group of teenagers.", "NTA\n\nWTF?!?", "Hard NTA I was never that big of a drinker but due to medical issues I'm not allowed to drink anymore..I would be soo mad.", "NTA   \n\n\nThey overstepped your boundaries.  \n\n\nSaying \"I don't drink\", \"I don't do alcohol\" or anything of the sort is setting a boundary.", "NTA - I would talk to an employment lawyer asap", "This can't be real... that's a really fucked up thing to do. NTA obviously", "NTA. Pretty sure that's illegal somehow. It's certainly unethical.", "Not only are you NTA, but isn\u2019t that literally illegal??", "NTA\n\nHad you thrown the drink over them and stormed out, they would still be the asshole.", "Yep. There\u2019s a certain medication that is included in the prophylactic protocol of a sexual assault exam that you can\u2019t have alcohol in your system more recently than 5 days and you aren\u2019t supposed to drink again for 2 days, if I recall.

It's like they're begging for a lawsuit.\n\nHonestly, if they tried this shit with someone who absolutely cannot consume alcohol for medical reasons they would be liable since they served and lied about the drink.\n\nDocument what you can, get evidence by getting them to talk about what happened via email -- something so they can incriminate themselves like admitting they participated in it\n\nAnd don't trust HR .
