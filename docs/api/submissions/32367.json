Anyway the work is fun and rewarding and that's what I focus on.\n\nI stopped drinking at the start of this year just because. No religious, health or addiction reasons. I just wasn't getting anything out of it any more and with my crazy drinking days long past me (I'm 36) I just didn't want to. I also have a 1 year old so I'm sure psychologically that had something to do with it.\n\nBack to the holiday party. Everyone was drinking and having a great time. I was mingling and talking to everyone too but got asked MULTIPLE times why I'm not drinking and got comments like \"Oh cmon just 1, don't be a spoilsport etc\". I just let it go because people were pretty buzzed. \n\nThen my manager comes over with a drink which she said was non-alcoholic.  She's actually one of the more normal ones so I took her at face value and had a couple of sips. Very quickly realized it was alcohol and then they all laughed and said \"haha gotcha \" and \"see it didn't kill ya\" and shit like that.  I was pissed off and asked why they did that, very calmly but with a straight face.  I was then told to 'lighten up' and have some fun and that it's not a big deal. Someone called me an asshole as well for making a big deal out of it.\n\nI haven't brought it up since but I'm curious to know if I was justified in being upset.

Can walk in with my BIL, he gets asked if he wants a beer, I get asked if I need a soda.  \n\nI hardly ever drink anything other than soda from a can or bottle, so anything handed to me in a glass would have been suspect.  Then comes the smell.  Then the taste.  It would either be set aside or dumped out.  Sorry, I said I don't care for alcohol.\n\nStrangers just don't seem to get it though.  I like making them squirm though.  If they don't take no for an answer, I then tell them my reason why I don't drink.  My mother was a severe alcoholic, I don't drink.

Seriously OP this is the same as slipping someone a drug in their drink.", "Well then that\u2019s another lawsuit. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My aunt goes into anaphylactic shock from drinking alcohol and people *still* try to pressure her into drinking :/", "OP wasn't drugged", "No", "But you would have had more fun with a couple of drinks. When everyone else is doing something fun and you decline to participate, you're putting a damper on the event for everyone. Since you have no actual valid reason not to drink, it's especially obnoxious.", "You're entitled to your opinion just as I'm entitled to mine.", "Regardless of gender for any of the multiple valid reasons, it is not ok that you're coworkers and manager literally tricked you into drinking alcohol after you very clearly and directly expressed that you weren't drinking that night. That shit is unethical and unprofessional at best and criminal at worst (IANAL).", "Seems my comment got a reaction. \n\n1. We do not know if the OP is, or is not, a recovering alcoholic. They didn't say. Only that they do not drink alcohol. \n2. Telling HR that you ARE a recovering alcoholic may or may not be an actual lie for the OP, but in this case, we have no information either way. \n3. Telling someone you are a recovering alcoholic does not violate HIPAA. \n4. Not all alcoholics have alcohol related medical issues or go to meetings.  \n\nI am a binge drinker. I LOVE rum.   I never drank every day.  I never even drank every week or even every month. \n\nBut when I DID drink, I drank enough to end up passed out. The last time I drank to excess, I did end up on the bathroom floor of a bar, unable to move, requiring an ambulance to take me to the ER because I couldn't get ahold of my family do come get my dumb drunk ass off the floor and home.  \n\nI have NEVER attended a meeting because I didn't need them to not drink. \n\nI don't have alcohol related medical issues that are in my medical history. \n\nI AM an alcoholic.  Personally, I don't care if anyone knows or not. The people at my work know. My family knows I do not drink alcohol. \n\nALL of my friends know I do not drink. \n\nI am not the type of that needs a drink.  I am the type of that doesn't stop once I do. \n\nThat does NOT mean I am not an alcoholic. I AM.  \n\nIf someone was stupid enough to try to trick me into drinking, I would be LIVID, and at the very least, that person would be wearing the remains of the drink once I realized it. \n\nAnd I would damn sure pitch a fit with HR if it was someone I worked with AND at a work function.", "Christ", "Alcohol is a relaxant, which is not what you want for a stiff spine.", "Idk, they just do? I don\u2019t ask them. But it\u2019s very common knowledge that people who drink very regularly push non-drinkers to drink.", "Alcohol is a conscious altering substance, which yes, does qualify as drugging someone.", "You're entitled to you opinion that she's not the AH, just as I'm entitled to my opinion that she is.\n\nDrinking is a part of socialization. When you opt out of it without a valid reason, you are being antisocial, and thus the AH. \n\nIn her OP, she said she didn't have any real reasons for not drinking.", "Omg yes of course! You are so right! Thank you.", "Seems you need to be reminded of something:  \n\n\nThe word \"no\" is a complete statement and does **not** require an explanation.  \n\n\nEven if you think otherwise.", "Or if he'd been driving home - where I am there's a zero tolerance for drink driving, you can't drink at all. HR all the way.", "That recommendation has changed.", "I agree, OP. Don't lie to HR, but let them know how uncomfortable this has made you, and you have been thi king about talking to a lawyer about this incident. You can still sit back and watch them scramble without having to lie.", "I can relate. When I drank, there was no such thing as \"just one\". If someone tricked me into drinking, there would be a HUGE issue. My sobriety means too much to have it disrespected by people thinking they are being funny or cute. \n\nOP- NTA at all. Your coworkers, however, are massive AHs for not respecting your boundaries, no matter what your reasons are for not drinking.", "One of the HR reps at my company was let go a few years ago for sleeping with one of the (married) owners and going psycho when she couldn't get him to leave his wife. So yeah, some companies will let just anyone be HR.", "That's a frivolous non-reason. \n\nA valid reason is \"I'm a recovering alcoholic\", \"my religious beliefs prohibit it\", \"I'm taking a medication that doesn't allow me to drink\".", "Who is this she you speak of?"]}
