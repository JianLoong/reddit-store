So ex and his wife were upset but decided if he wasn't feeling good he should stay home. The babysitter also told ex our son seemed fine once everyone was gone and he'd been normal.\n\nOur son admitted it to his dad when asked directly and ex grounded him for a month and told him he would not be having any kind of fun when he missed something as important as his wedding, and the day their family became bigger.\n\nWhen the exchange day took place ex sent me this long, in depth email about what our son had done, the punishment he had set, and that he expected me to continue the punishment at my house so our son could be grounded for 4 consecutive weeks instead of spreading it over two months.\n\nI spoke to our son when we were home and he admitted to me that he was really upset about his dad getting married and the fact things at his house were now permanent and that he didn't love that his stepmom was now his stepmom and her daughters were now his stepsisters. I told him I would make him an appointment with his therapist. She got him in quickly and they had a good talk.\n\nI also decided not to continue the grounding at my house. I notified my ex.

That I had gotten him therapy for that very reason and that ex chose not to bring our son when he has him, as is his right, but I also have the right to take a different approach to this.\n\nEx said that our son never told him these things and I should be backing him up. I pointed out our son did tell him. It was two years ago but he did tell him and he gave him attitude for it. Ex said it was no excuse and I should help punish him. I told him I want our son to tell me things so I will always try to find ways to help him without punishing him.\n\nEx and his wife say I'm an asshole and I should continue the punishment. She said I would not allow my son to dictate my life or that I would not like him skipping something like that of mine.

My reaction would have been to ask why he didn't want to go.  I think that grounding him for a month is too much, and stops any hope of your son and your ex having a warm relationship.   Regarding the amount of information you receive from your son, I also made the decision that I'd rather know what was going on and not punish my daughter.

My significant other is good with it and thinks it might also be a benefit for his kids (boy and a girl).

My ex was annoyed at him for bringing it up so he never brought it up again.\n\nI'm doing my best.", "No abuse. Though my son is not overly fond of his stepmom and one stepsister in particular either, which I think made this tougher. Stepmom is a lot like his dad. She's far more strict and is not the touchy feely type to quote how my ex describes me. While her oldest daughter tries to parent my son and is very in his face about correcting some things. Like how she'd tell him they're his sisters now (this was after ex and his wife moved in together and before any engagement happened) and how he will call them that while getting very close to him. Ex and his wife are aokay with that but it bothered my son a lot. Even stuff like he can't play video games because he's playing with them is how she'll speak to him.\n\nPart of why we ended up divorcing is ex and I disagreed on parenting and how we wanted to be with our son. He said he learned from his best friends parents that you need tight control and rules for kids and there can be no excuses for bad behavior. While I tend to believe some things need consequences in the way of a kind of punishment, sometimes kids need help and guidance and to be able to talk. Which ex said puts me firmly in modern bad parent mode.\n\nSo I don't think ex would change anything if we all sit down together. I worry he'd be even harder on our son.", "Dad and new wife are just assholes. He\u2019s taking it out on his son because the son\u2019s having trouble accepting the new wife.

Showing my son that he could be honest with me about anything, even stuff that I might not like or could upset me in some way, and that I would be understanding and would help him rather than punish him has allowed us more communication.

It's a shame because the best thing for our son would be feeling this way about both of us and having the support both sides. I can't change my ex.

I'm so glad we found her.", "If the punishment is ever physically you need to report that and go for full custody.\n\nINFO : are his step sisters bullying him or harming him in some way or does he just not get on with them?\n\nI would reccomend trying a parenting through separation course if therapy isn't on the table for your ex but idk how receptive they'd be to that either they seem like the type who don't want more potential witnesses who could report possible abuse hence being anti therapy", "Well you're teaching him ita totally OK to lie and manipulate people.", "Some will say bullying is a strong word. But the oldest is especially very forceful with him and in his face to make her point. She acts like she can parent him and tell him what to do. The youngest he doesn't have the same amount of issues with but she backs her sister which frustrates my son.\n\nThe older one will demand he play with them when he's doing something else, and will act as though she has authority, and maybe her mom and my ex give her that. She will correct him harshly for not calling them his sisters. She has called him a brat for not doing it automatically. Stuff like that is what's going on with them.", "How am I teaching him that? I am getting him therapy to help him through all these feelings. He's now open with me about his feelings and his struggles with the changes in his life and the new additions. Sometimes methods that are not punishments work best. He was acting out around my significant other and his kids when he thought we'd all be moving in together. So we halted all talks of that when he did open up to me and I put him in therapy. It helped him so much. He's come around to them a lot since. I didn't punish him for feeling how he did.", "Found the dad!", "That's not okay, you can't force someone to call you sister that's weird OP", "That's awful. \n\nMaybe you or the therapist can give him a script of things to say to him when she does this so that he can establish his boundaries", "It is.

You chose to put your life on hold to help him with the transition, while your ex has chosen to move full speed ahead. I cannot say which one is right or wrong, but you guys have to be united in hiw you raise him.\n\nEx punishes him. You unground him and have a therapist talk to him. Therapy can be a good thing, but both parents should have talked to him first, preferably together. \n\nIn addition, regardless of why he did it, lying is wrong. Faking that you are sick is wrong too. His feelings are just, but his actions were wrong, and that should be stressed. Otherwise, he wil commit more and greater poor behaviors, and use having divorced parents to justify his bad behavior.", "Oh man, I\u2019m on the fence. As a SP (and just parent) lying is not okay, and his dad was going to marry his step mom anyways and he needs to respect them. At 8, \u201crespect is earned\u201d is honestly not a thing yet and kids are taught how to respect and be respectful.\n\nAlso, you guys are coparenting, so that\u2019s what you should be doing, coparenting. If you had grounded him for this long for a reason your ex didn\u2019t agree with, you would still expect your ex to hold that standard for your son. So now you aren\u2019t being a good coparent and respecting the other parents wishes.\n\nBut therapy definitely is the right move. And your ex needs to know that too. Clearly he didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to his dad about the fact that he didn\u2019t like step mom or sisters and he should have been able to have a clear line of communication open with him. (Not that he should have expected dad to break up with step mom, but the expectation that dad would listen and try to help improve that relationship) \n\nSide note, I think a month was way too long.

We must have done something right because she is now a doctor with children of her own that I dote on. \n\nThe important thing for your son is to always make him feel very welcome and a key part of your family because all too often in blended families the step mum treats her children better than she treats those of her new husband.

So son will be going back to dads only to be grounded? What are the stipulations of the punishment here?", "No his dad did that when he dismissed everything he was feeling.", "Idk why she even posted here. No matter how valid and balanced your points are, she just argues tooth and nail against them. Clearly she doesn't think she was in the wrong so idk why tf she even bothered posting here lol", "Other than her comments about the history of her ex's awful abusive behavior. HE'S A CHILD. His dad is marrying someone he's uncomfortable around and forcing him into a house with people that are mean to him on top of being a shit excuse for a dad in the first place. Hopefully his mom can get him the hell away from that place. Sociopathic behavior? Good God that's dumb as fuck. He lied because he was scared.", "Rushing a relationship with a control freak and step sisters who treat him like shit while continuously punishing him for every little thing and already dismissing what he's currently upset about... Sounds like such a caring father. I struggled with my dad DATING a woman who tried to be my third parent at that exact age. You're expecting adult maturity from a child instead of trying to figure out the problem.", "If your child reports distress and the therapist agrees that being at that house is causing your son distress, you could use that to push for more custody with the therapists backing.", "she wasn't in the wrong.", "It's a shame, I think it's a really good learning opportunity and for the most part she seems like she makes positive decisions for her child. I think criticisms of this one decision is maybe making her feel as though all her decisions are under attack.", "Sounds like maybe you\u2019re projecting then? \n\nAgain my biggest issue is OP taught her son, who she only has a 50% right to parent, that you can just lie when you need to get out of something important and there won\u2019t be any consequences. That\u2019s obviously also poor parenting.", "Remember that these are all opinions, not facts.", "Nope, just actually looking at the issue instead of finding any way to blame everyone but the real issue. She took him to therapy for this issue. I doubt you've been (you'd benefit) it's not all cookies and rainbows. He's received his consequences already. His mom was correct not to continue the shit punishment and actually try to solve the issue. Because the way you and the ex would go about it... You'd end up with severely dysfunctional young adults. An abundance of punishment and nothing else isn't parenting. It's abuse.", "You kniw she calls him a brat because her mom has, don't you?", "I think you might need more therapy since you (wrongly) assume I've never been and are wielding that as some kind of insult at me? Who thinks therapy is rainbow and cookies? seriously. You also are treating therapy like its some miracle cure when there are lots of terrible therapists and its not a panacea for mental health issues.\n\nI'm not even saying I agree with the dad's punishment. I don't know their family dynamic and I cannot tell who is in the right. This story was written from the perspective of someone who thinks it is wrong for her (as a parent) to be dating right now so of course she is bias'ed against her ex's decision to get married.\n\nMy only issue is that mom endorsed lying a strategy to deal with the father, which undermines his role as a parent. Agree or disagree, he still has a 50% say in how to parent this child."]}
