So ex and his wife were upset but decided if he wasn't feeling good he should stay home. The babysitter also told ex our son seemed fine once everyone was gone and he'd been normal.\n\nOur son admitted it to his dad when asked directly and ex grounded him for a month and told him he would not be having any kind of fun when he missed something as important as his wedding, and the day their family became bigger.\n\nWhen the exchange day took place ex sent me this long, in depth email about what our son had done, the punishment he had set, and that he expected me to continue the punishment at my house so our son could be grounded for 4 consecutive weeks instead of spreading it over two months.\n\nI spoke to our son when we were home and he admitted to me that he was really upset about his dad getting married and the fact things at his house were now permanent and that he didn't love that his stepmom was now his stepmom and her daughters were now his stepsisters. I told him I would make him an appointment with his therapist. She got him in quickly and they had a good talk.\n\nI also decided not to continue the grounding at my house. I notified my ex. He was pissed. His wife was pissed. They told me mine and ex's son had disrespected both of them and had disrespected his new sisters by avoiding the celebration of them all becoming one family. I told them that Callum (son) was struggling with all the changes and he's had trouble adjusting to us no longer being together and us both having new partners who have other kids. That I had gotten him therapy for that very reason and that ex chose not to bring our son when he has him, as is his right, but I also have the right to take a different approach to this.\n\nEx said that our son never told him these things and I should be backing him up. I pointed out our son did tell him. It was two years ago but he did tell him and he gave him attitude for it. Ex said it was no excuse and I should help punish him. I told him I want our son to tell me things so I will always try to find ways to help him without punishing him.\n\nEx and his wife say I'm an asshole and I should continue the punishment. She said I would not allow my son to dictate my life or that I would not like him skipping something like that of mine.

My reaction would have been to ask why he didn't want to go.  I think that grounding him for a month is too much, and stops any hope of your son and your ex having a warm relationship.   Regarding the amount of information you receive from your son, I also made the decision that I'd rather know what was going on and not punish my daughter.

My significant other is good with it and thinks it might also be a benefit for his kids (boy and a girl).

My ex was annoyed at him for bringing it up so he never brought it up again.\n\nI'm doing my best.", "No abuse. Though my son is not overly fond of his stepmom and one stepsister in particular either, which I think made this tougher. Stepmom is a lot like his dad. She's far more strict and is not the touchy feely type to quote how my ex describes me. While her oldest daughter tries to parent my son and is very in his face about correcting some things. Like how she'd tell him they're his sisters now (this was after ex and his wife moved in together and before any engagement happened) and how he will call them that while getting very close to him. Ex and his wife are aokay with that but it bothered my son a lot. Even stuff like he can't play video games because he's playing with them is how she'll speak to him.\n\nPart of why we ended up divorcing is ex and I disagreed on parenting and how we wanted to be with our son. He said he learned from his best friends parents that you need tight control and rules for kids and there can be no excuses for bad behavior. While I tend to believe some things need consequences in the way of a kind of punishment, sometimes kids need help and guidance and to be able to talk. Which ex said puts me firmly in modern bad parent mode.\n\nSo I don't think ex would change anything if we all sit down together. I worry he'd be even harder on our son.", "Dad and new wife are just assholes. He\u2019s taking it out on his son because the son\u2019s having trouble accepting the new wife.

Showing my son that he could be honest with me about anything, even stuff that I might not like or could upset me in some way, and that I would be understanding and would help him rather than punish him has allowed us more communication. It's the kind of thing I wish I'd had with my own parents and it will benefit us as he gets older too.", "You should push for as much custody as possible.

It's a shame because the best thing for our son would be feeling this way about both of us and having the support both sides. I can't change my ex. I can only advocate for our son and do my best to help him through these challenges in his life. His therapist has been amazing for him. I'm so glad we found her.", "If the punishment is ever physically you need to report that and go for full custody.\n\nINFO : are his step sisters bullying him or harming him in some way or does he just not get on with them?\n\nI would reccomend trying a parenting through separation course if therapy isn't on the table for your ex but idk how receptive they'd be to that either they seem like the type who don't want more potential witnesses who could report possible abuse hence being anti therapy", "Well you're teaching him ita totally OK to lie and manipulate people.", "Some will say bullying is a strong word. But the oldest is especially very forceful with him and in his face to make her point. She acts like she can parent him and tell him what to do. The youngest he doesn't have the same amount of issues with but she backs her sister which frustrates my son.\n\nThe older one will demand he play with them when he's doing something else, and will act as though she has authority, and maybe her mom and my ex give her that. She will correct him harshly for not calling them his sisters. She has called him a brat for not doing it automatically. Stuff like that is what's going on with them.", "How am I teaching him that? I am getting him therapy to help him through all these feelings. He's now open with me about his feelings and his struggles with the changes in his life and the new additions. Sometimes methods that are not punishments work best. He was acting out around my significant other and his kids when he thought we'd all be moving in together. So we halted all talks of that when he did open up to me and I put him in therapy. It helped him so much. He's come around to them a lot since. I didn't punish him for feeling how he did.", "Found the dad!", "That's not okay, you can't force someone to call you sister that's weird OP", "That's awful. \n\nMaybe you or the therapist can give him a script of things to say to him when she does this so that he can establish his boundaries", "It is.

Damn your ex is failing as a father though.", "NTA I see why you divorced daddy-o", "NTA, a month is extreme for an 8 year old.\n\nAnd he's clearly working through some things emotionally with the change in family dynamics.", "ESH, as both of you guys are not presenting a united front, which is confusing for your son. \n\nYour son is struggling with the changes that have occurred. You chose to put your life on hold to help him with the transition, while your ex has chosen to move full speed ahead. I cannot say which one is right or wrong, but you guys have to be united in hiw you raise him.\n\nEx punishes him. You unground him and have a therapist talk to him. Therapy can be a good thing, but both parents should have talked to him first, preferably together. \n\nIn addition, regardless of why he did it, lying is wrong. Faking that you are sick is wrong too. His feelings are just, but his actions were wrong, and that should be stressed. Otherwise, he wil commit more and greater poor behaviors, and use having divorced parents to justify his bad behavior.", "Oh man, I\u2019m on the fence. As a SP (and just parent) lying is not okay, and his dad was going to marry his step mom anyways and he needs to respect them. At 8, \u201crespect is earned\u201d is honestly not a thing yet and kids are taught how to respect and be respectful.\n\nAlso, you guys are coparenting, so that\u2019s what you should be doing, coparenting. If you had grounded him for this long for a reason your ex didn\u2019t agree with, you would still expect your ex to hold that standard for your son. So now you aren\u2019t being a good coparent and respecting the other parents wishes.\n\nBut therapy definitely is the right move. And your ex needs to know that too. Clearly he didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking to his dad about the fact that he didn\u2019t like step mom or sisters and he should have been able to have a clear line of communication open with him. (Not that he should have expected dad to break up with step mom, but the expectation that dad would listen and try to help improve that relationship) \n\nSide note, I think a month was way too long. It\u2019s hard to say what an appropriate punishment, if any, would have been but it definitely wasn\u2019t a one month grounding.

We must have done something right because she is now a doctor with children of her own that I dote on. \n\nThe important thing for your son is to always make him feel very welcome and a key part of your family because all too often in blended families the step mum treats her children better than she treats those of her new husband.

Sometimes I'm needed there.", "My thought exactly. The kid knew his dad would just have an attitude and brush off his concerns like he's done before. Kid's been miserable about the situation for two years and I'm sure his dad has never bothered to really talk with him about it all in the hopes that his issues with his dad remarrying would just magically go away.", "Wow. That\u2019s harsh and really excessive. I would save all documentation for this. I would also inform your ex that if he intends to dole out punishments like that where he expects you to follow through then he needs to consult you and agree on things together. \n\nIs there anything in your custody agreement that could allow for you to keep custody of son longer given the circumstances? And is this worth a conversation with a lawyer? Because I wouldn\u2019t even give this punishment to a teenager it\u2019s just highly inappropriate. Particularly for and 8 year old.", "Frankly that\u2019s absurd. He is 8!! A punishment should be appropriate not only for the \u201ccrime\u201d but also the child\u2019s age. That is excessive. I don\u2019t see things getting better for your son at his fathers house. \n\nHonestly I feel for your little guy. I have a step son. He\u2019s almost 15 now but was 4 when his dad and I married. I understand how scary it was for him to have a new step mom and a new step sister. I was careful to be mindful of that when it came to his behavior. \n\nI understood he might lash out or be angry about all the changes. I never took it personally. I just tried to love him. It was really hard at times. He really resented me for \u201ctaking his dad away\u201d. So we would set aside time for him and his dad to go do stuff just them. We made sure that any \u201cfamily\u201d events happened when we had him, so he never felt like he was being pushed out . \n\nAnd if he messed up, or lashed out, it was a conversation first, not a punishment. If a consequence was required because his behavior had hurt someone else, it was appropriate to age. \n\nBasically I wore that kid down with love. \n\nWe have a really good relationship now. He knows I love him and I\u2019m not going anywhere. He\u2019s my kid and I\u2019ll fight dragons for him. My husband is the same way with my daughter. \n\nBlending families is not easy. It requires intention and patience. And that the adults understand they are dealing with children having emotional reactions like children do. \n\nThese people that marry a person with kids and then treat the kids like crap make me furious. \n\nI\u2019m angry for your little guy. He deserves better. Sadly I don\u2019t see it getting better. If they are punishing him this severely at his young age, I have a feeling it will only get worse. Every time he doesn\u2019t fall in line like they want they will likely overreact. \n\nYour son was a hurt little boy who didn\u2019t know how to deal with his big emotions. Upset kids get stomach aches. Shame on your ex. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d take him back to court and insist on family counseling for your son. I feel like this is just the beginning of your son being punished for his (normal and healthy) emotions.", "So he has his dad ignoring him, his dad's wife calling him names and the oldest kid trying to flex on him - probably mimicking her mom.\n\nSounds like an absolute nightmare in terms of household dynamics and I can guarantee your son will grow up resenting each and every person in that household; or developing poor escape behaviors to get away from these people; or lashing out in his teens. They're all trying to control him in one way shape or form and take away any autonomy he has. That's a recipe for disaster!", "That sounds like bullying to me.", "She\u2019s dating. She said her partner has two kids (boy & girl) & new partner & she decided to hold off on moving in together because the kids weren\u2019t ready. Her son & partners kids get along very well, unlike the situation with the ex.", "OP I just want to reply here to try to better explain the position. In your own post you say:\n\n\"I told him I want our son to tell me things so I will always try to find ways to help him without punishing him.\"\n\nYou are undermining the father's right to also have that in his relationship with your son. Obviously your son doesn't need to love his step-mom and its really hard as an only child to adapt to that situation. However, 8 years old is old enough to understand that growing up means all have obligations and sometimes we don't always get what we want.\n\nAttending the wedding (doesn't even sound like they forced him to have a role in it, just be a guest) is such a low bar in terms of ways you can support your family. I think the people calling you A-H are concerned the lesson your son learned is that he can lie to his father without consequence because mom will cover for him.\n\nYour ex's punishment isn't appropriate because it won't be effective, I completely agree with you there but you also are very quick to sweep your son's actions under the rug too.", "That's a really good thing. Please don't think i'm criticising you as a parent or person, I think you want the best for your son and I have a differing opinion to you, as how to go about it. I think we can both agree that Dad's punishment is unfair and not helpful.

OP can\u2019t control the fact that dad isn\u2019t being a good parent to their son, but that doesn\u2019t mean she should ALSO be a bad parent to their son.", "Nope. The lesson the son learned is that his asshole father doesnt control his mother's houae.", "I disagree, but that's besides the point. It seems to me like she only accepts validating narratives.\n\nTo me, it seems pretty clear that the child is learning negative behaviours (lie/feign illness to get out of things they don't want to do - especially such a huge milestone) and that not showing a united front provides nothing but confusion to the child.\n\nThere's so many comments saying \"you don't have to follow a single aspect of parenting that he also follows\" and while technically true, any sane person can see just how damaging that confusion could be to a developing child.\n\nThat's not saying that the father is right either. Seems pretty obvious to me that they're both in the wrong in different ways (his attitude towards therapy, for example, is massively fucked up) but hey, that's just my opinion - and you have yours.\n\nESH imo", "Yeah I think you're right, but to be fair she literally asked for criticism by posting here lol\n\nI agree with pretty much everything you've said. Most balanced take I've seen on here.", "Was the father's request that his son attend the wedding unreasonable to begin with?", "But what are you supposed to do when your co-parent is unwilling to bend at all?

An invitation, not a summons.", "Hahahahaha sure. I said it was a miracle cure? News to me. I'm still in therapy \ud83e\udd37 but if you've been you definitely should go back because you are defending an abuser.

I honestly don't know the best path forward, but their son should definitely be in therapy to help him through this doubtlessly very difficult time, and perhaps the parents need some kind of outside help to find some balance.\n\nAs I said, I agree that the father sounds like he has a lot of issues and is not behaving in a manner befitting of a co-parent, but in this one specific situation at least I think she has handled it badly.\n\nIt's definitely a complex and delicate situation.", "I think too many people are saying n ta too quickly I would like more info. \n\n1st I assume this wasn\u2019t a surprise for your son and he knew about it for a while.

Who is right?\n\nIf you read my post accurately, sweetie, you would see that the only issue I take with the mother's behavior is the tacit endorsement that child did nothing wrong by lying.

Probably.  But that's going to happen regardless because the father doesn't really seem to care about the child's feelings.

Or even letting him invite a friend so he have someone to hang out /play with (in case he doesn\u2019t have any cousins near his age) would have been enough incentive. \n\nAnd inconsistent parenting / punishments just teach him that he can pit mom against dad or vice versa. Giving him another manipulation tool that he\u2019ll get the hang of in no time.", "I have mixed feelings about this, because I do believe you did the right thing by wanting to get him therapy and everything. However, I do feel like the punishment wasn\u2019t that bad that you couldn\u2019t uphold it also in your household. Like lying is a big thing at their age, so I feel like that should also be dealt with. But that depends on the reason he doesn\u2019t like the new family, is it just because he doesn\u2019t like change or is it because they treat him differently or are mean to him. I think that is where my dilemma comes in.", "The child is yours and your ex's,  not his current wife. So her opinion means Jack squat. I also understand the troubling issues your son is having. All this being said. You counter minded your husband's disciplinary actions against what he sees as a wrong that your guys son did.  So now that you have gone against it. Don't throw shade or be disgruntled if he does the same to you when (not if)you have to discipline your child. Turnabout is fair play.  Just keep that in mind since you seem to wanna be the \"fun and kind\" parent to your kid.", "Well, I think you\u2019re TA.  Your son now knows the any time your ex levies a consequence, he can go to your house where the punishment won\u2019t be continued.  You have showed a lack of respect for your ex and you have started that famous game of pitting one parent against the other.  Of course he was upset about his dad\u2019s wedding!  His dad\u2019s wedding meant his mom and dad wouldn\u2019t ever get back together!  The good thing you did was get him therapy.  As a retired teacher, I saw that the most well adjusted kids were the ones where the parents demonstrated a united front to the children.  Same rules applied in both households and the parents talked to one another and not at one another.", ">WHY ARE WE EVEN THINKING OF PUNISHMENT?  \n>  \n>He stayed home. It was his form of protest,\n\nEh, for that reason.  For trying to impose limits onto his father's relationships and hurting the feelings of everyone else.\n\nIts excessive, not the best approach and there are issues about setting punishments across two households, but the motivation is obvious.", "> BTW, don\u2019t you think the kid got punished enough being thrust into a familial relationship that he is not ready to accept? \n\nThinking of this as a punishment is as unhealthy as refusing the 8 year old therapy like the ex is doing.", "Some people just don't like change. There doesn't have to be 'a reason'", "Having an 8 year old dictate the rules is so appropriate when it aligns with your feelings.", "I just made a post about this on Facebook.

I was your son, so this post really, really resonates with me and I just want to be constructive and helpful here.\n\nYou said this situation is \"not something to change the custody time for.\" Says who? Have you actually talked to a lawyer and told him that you have your son in therapy partially because his father is basically a bully with a parenting style that belongs in the 60s? More than that, he's now brought in an entire stepfamily of bullies. With testimony of his therapist (if they are qualified to give testimony, which you should find out if they are, otherwise the court will appoint one) and just some of the (paraphrased) quotes from the father that you've given here, I have a very, very hard time believing that a family court judge would not see that your son is enduring moderate but extremely persistent abuse. That's the key here. The persistence. It's the sort of thing that leads to CPTSD (PTSD not caused by one event but many sometimes smaller ones spread over all of childhood).\n\nAgain, forgive me if I'm offending you, but I was close to my mother up until my late twenties when I started getting more info about my parents' marriage My mom left him almost as soon as I, the only buffer between them, left for college. I should have figured it out a lot earlier, buy my mother could have gotten me away from my bully father when I was even younger than your son. She was very loving and my relationship with her was very good, but it just takes one parent to severely damage a child. \n\nMy father did a lot of damage. My mother could have gotten me away. She didn't. And since I figured that out our relationship has been extremely strained. Given that she probably only has a few years left, our relationship will certainly end as it is. \n\nIn the battle between therapy and the damage your husband seems intent on doing, your husband and the damage will win. I promise you. I've been there. Please, please, please, get him out as soon as possible. And good luck.", "Hi OP. I hope you\u2019re feeling more confident in your decision not to punish your kid about this. You seem like a really good mom who is putting her son first\u2026in every way possible. As a kid of divorced parents with complicated step family situations, I\u2019m proud of you. \n\nI read through your comments and just wanted to share one thing with you. I don\u2019t need the answer, but does his Dad have a temper? I\u2019m not a parent and I would be sad if my kid skipped my wedding and pretended to be sick to get out of it. But I wouldn\u2019t punish him? Especially this extensively as he\u2019s really still little. \n\nI guess I just wanted to be sure that someone had checked in with him about how things are going at Dad\u2019s house (besides this fiasco). Does he feel included otherwise? Does Dad get mad a lot because your son isn\u2019t exactly on board with his new life? The therapist might be a good person to have this convo. I just wouldn\u2019t want your son to be experiencing emotional abuse or a really toxic situation and feeling like the odd man out. Sometimes that\u2019s hard to verbalize as a little kid I guess. Since you seem really in tune with your kid and like you really give a shit, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already thought about this. But on the off chance you hadn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t scroll by without saying something. \n\nGood luck!", "Op needs to take the ex to court not just fir more custody time but to have it in writing of counseling sessions being needed and ex cant deny their son counseling.

He should be more concerned about creating a family that everyone is a part of because they want to be, not because their being told they have to be.
