Ex got married last weekend. My ex was furious when he found out and the truth came out because he went home to check on our son in the afternoon and found our son perfectly fine after saying that morning that his stomach hurt really bad and he felt like he was going to be sick and actually pretended to have puked at some point that morning. So ex and his wife were upset but decided if he wasn't feeling good he should stay home. The babysitter also told ex our son seemed fine once everyone was gone and he'd been normal.\n\nOur son admitted it to his dad when asked directly and ex grounded him for a month and told him he would not be having any kind of fun when he missed something as important as his wedding, and the day their family became bigger.\n\nWhen the exchange day took place ex sent me this long, in depth email about what our son had done, the punishment he had set, and that he expected me to continue the punishment at my house so our son could be grounded for 4 consecutive weeks instead of spreading it over two months.\n\nI spoke to our son when we were home and he admitted to me that he was really upset about his dad getting married and the fact things at his house were now permanent and that he didn't love that his stepmom was now his stepmom and her daughters were now his stepsisters. I told him I would make him an appointment with his therapist. She got him in quickly and they had a good talk.\n\nI also decided not to continue the grounding at my house. I notified my ex. He was pissed. His wife was pissed. They told me mine and ex's son had disrespected both of them and had disrespected his new sisters by avoiding the celebration of them all becoming one family. I told them that Callum (son) was struggling with all the changes and he's had trouble adjusting to us no longer being together and us both having new partners who have other kids. That I had gotten him therapy for that very reason and that ex chose not to bring our son when he has him, as is his right, but I also have the right to take a different approach to this.\n\nEx said that our son never told him these things and I should be backing him up. I pointed out our son did tell him. It was two years ago but he did tell him and he gave him attitude for it. Ex said it was no excuse and I should help punish him. I told him I want our son to tell me things so I will always try to find ways to help him without punishing him.\n\nEx and his wife say I'm an asshole and I should continue the punishment. She said I would not allow my son to dictate my life or that I would not like him skipping something like that of mine. I told her I delayed furthering my relationship until my son is more comfortable and I did so because he wasn't behaving the best around them and we talked and I realized he'd need help and time.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691746131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o42cw/aita_for_not_continuing_the_punishment_our_ex_set/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's sad to see that most parents just order their children around without any regard for their feelings, just because they're kids.", "NTA.  I'm surprised at your ex's response to the truth.  My reaction would have been to ask why he didn't want to go.  I think that grounding him for a month is too much, and stops any hope of your son and your ex having a warm relationship.   Regarding the amount of information you receive from your son, I also made the decision that I'd rather know what was going on and not punish my daughter.

At the very least my ex believes therapy is pointless and is used to make excuses for bad behavior and not growing a spine and toughening up when life is coming at you. We disagreed about it when I put our son into therapy. He also never wanted therapy to work on our marriage so I would say he is anti-therapy.", "A lot came very quickly for him. Ex and I both found new partners around a similar time. Ex introduced our son fast (3 months in) and they were living together after another few months. Last year my significant other and I discussed moving in but it wasn't right for my son and I knew he'd had a lot of change in his life, so we agreed to wait. My significant other is good with it and thinks it might also be a benefit for his kids (boy and a girl). Honestly my son has come around far more to them than I expected when he first said how he was feeling. Still not at a stage where we would make huge moves. But he enjoys having them around now. And nobody is demanding they call each other siblings or us their parents.", "My son did tell his dad early in the relationship. My ex was annoyed at him for bringing it up so he never brought it up again.\n\nI'm doing my best.", "No abuse. Though my son is not overly fond of his stepmom and one stepsister in particular either, which I think made this tougher. Stepmom is a lot like his dad. She's far more strict and is not the touchy feely type to quote how my ex describes me. While her oldest daughter tries to parent my son and is very in his face about correcting some things. Like how she'd tell him they're his sisters now (this was after ex and his wife moved in together and before any engagement happened) and how he will call them that while getting very close to him. Ex and his wife are aokay with that but it bothered my son a lot. Even stuff like he can't play video games because he's playing with them is how she'll speak to him.\n\nPart of why we ended up divorcing is ex and I disagreed on parenting and how we wanted to be with our son. He said he learned from his best friends parents that you need tight control and rules for kids and there can be no excuses for bad behavior. While I tend to believe some things need consequences in the way of a kind of punishment, sometimes kids need help and guidance and to be able to talk. Which ex said puts me firmly in modern bad parent mode.\n\nSo I don't think ex would change anything if we all sit down together. I worry he'd be even harder on our son.", "Dad and new wife are just assholes. He\u2019s taking it out on his son because the son\u2019s having trouble accepting the new wife. Grounding him for a fucking month is insane. It\u2019s just revenge and punishment out of frustration and anger. Won\u2019t teach him anything but further resentment.", "My ex is very pro punish so I don't think he'd ever pass up a chance to punish him.", "And yet, you commented.", "I feel the same way. Showing my son that he could be honest with me about anything, even stuff that I might not like or could upset me in some way, and that I would be understanding and would help him rather than punish him has allowed us more communication. It's the kind of thing I wish I'd had with my own parents and it will benefit us as he gets older too.", "You should push for as much custody as possible.  Things at your ex\u2019s house will only get worse.  They will ostracize your son for his feelings of unease due to the changing family dynamic.  This is very dangerous and can result in repression and internalized trauma later on.", "Save the email and other written communication about the 4 week punishment. I am concerned that your ex's behavior towards your son will escalate next time kiddo returns to his care.", "Keep all communication in email. Much easier to print off and show the lawyers.", "Yeah he sounds like a peice of work who is selfishly doing harm to his kid. \"growing a spine and toughening up\" just sounds like another way to say \" stiff upper lip pretend it's all okay and bottle it up or you're a baby \" that's how you end up having a nervous breakdown or exploding or \"suddenly\" dying from a suicide nobody else saw coming because you just repressed your emotions and didn't talk about them or learn to cope with them. He is setting up his son to fail in life by not taking mental health and emotions seriously \n\nINFO: Does your son actually WANT to live with them? Could you go for more Custody ? Do they often punish him for his emotions and are the punishments often outsized like this one is?", "That\u2019s such a shame. You sound like a really kind empathetic mum with nothing but your kid\u2019s best interests at heart. One of the most striking things to me in the way you explained your story is that you in no way tried to drag his dad or wife through the mud. You stated facts, irrespective of your feelings of their parenting. \nIf home life with dad really is like that, unfortunately your child will likely come to the conclusion that dad isn\u2019t an emotionally safe space for him. But he will be okay, because he\u2019s got you.\nFollow your instincts mom, put your child first. Keep giving him that safe space.\nAnd a high five for sending him to therapy.

I cannot answer whether they often punish him for that but I know it's not something they are opposed to.", "Sadly, my son has already reached that conclusion with his dad. It's a shame because the best thing for our son would be feeling this way about both of us and having the support both sides. I can't change my ex. I can only advocate for our son and do my best to help him through these challenges in his life. His therapist has been amazing for him. I'm so glad we found her.", "If the punishment is ever physically you need to report that and go for full custody.\n\nINFO : are his step sisters bullying him or harming him in some way or does he just not get on with them?\n\nI would reccomend trying a parenting through separation course if therapy isn't on the table for your ex but idk how receptive they'd be to that either they seem like the type who don't want more potential witnesses who could report possible abuse hence being anti therapy", "Well you're teaching him ita totally OK to lie and manipulate people.", "Some will say bullying is a strong word. But the oldest is especially very forceful with him and in his face to make her point. She acts like she can parent him and tell him what to do. The youngest he doesn't have the same amount of issues with but she backs her sister which frustrates my son.\n\nThe older one will demand he play with them when he's doing something else, and will act as though she has authority, and maybe her mom and my ex give her that. She will correct him harshly for not calling them his sisters. She has called him a brat for not doing it automatically. Stuff like that is what's going on with them.", "How am I teaching him that? I am getting him therapy to help him through all these feelings. He's now open with me about his feelings and his struggles with the changes in his life and the new additions. Sometimes methods that are not punishments work best. He was acting out around my significant other and his kids when he thought we'd all be moving in together. So we halted all talks of that when he did open up to me and I put him in therapy. It helped him so much. He's come around to them a lot since. I didn't punish him for feeling how he did.", "Found the dad!", "That's not okay, you can't force someone to call you sister that's weird OP", "That's awful. \n\nMaybe you or the therapist can give him a script of things to say to him when she does this so that he can establish his boundaries", "It is. This has been going on since before my ex and his wife were engaged even. Back when they moved in together this seemed to become a problem."]}
