I also would have called on their friends for coming over and harassing me.", "NTA. Once you start aiming at houses, you can fuck all the way off.", "NTA. They are actually trying to hurt people or damage property they deserved to get in trouble.", "Holy crap NTA let\u2019s be very clear here, they could have hit someone and blown a finger off, they could have started a fire. You were kind at first but then when you couldn\u2019t work things out nicely you called the cops. Their friend sounds like a piece of work too. I\u2019d keep the footage of the friend coming over as evidence. You hopefully won\u2019t need it but better safe than sorry.", "NTA. These people are psychos.\n\nYou probs have grounds for a protection order if they keep fucking with you", "NTA\nYou clearly asked for them to stop and they were only doing it with the intention to hurt others. You did the right thing, plus it\u2019ll be a good start for a paper trail if they try to harass you over it", "NTA\n\nThis is not just a noise or rudeness issue, this is a real danger that needed to be stopped for everyone safety. This was criminal behavior!", "Not the Ahole.  If they're aiming the firworks AT the houses, it could have been a very devastating situation if one (or more) of the houses caught fire.  The neighbours were the a-holes not you.", "NTA. They could have literally killed someone", "NTA you asked nicely first. They not only ignored you, they threatened you. Misplaced fireworks can go very wrong. They are lucky they didn\u2019t start a house fire. I wonder if attempted arson is a thing? Reckless endangerment certainly is.", "NTA That's a threat to public safety and a so incredibly irresponsible! Anyone on the local fire department will agree!Not to mention fireworks are nice(?)...on occasion...when planned. But if your neighbors are just lighting them off at all times of the year ugh, i'd be so upset in that situation. Tell me you have no regard for your neighbor's quality of life without telling me... just light off some fireworks jeez.Not to mention the damage they cause to wildlife, pets and people with Ptsd. I think you did the neighborhood a favor.", "These guys are losers man, I'd file a report if any of them come back. People like this don't learn by asking nicely or talking to them. Don't interact with them, report and record everything by them. Make sure anything valuable you keep outside has a camera on it too. NTA op, your shitty neighbors are though", "ynta i would have done the same thing", "Nope. NTA", "Goodness no you are NTA!  It\u2019s scary to have neighbors like this. Keep those cameras working and don\u2019t hesitate to report anything they do or say and document everything", "Being the passive-aggressive person that I can be at times I would have asked them if I could fire one off, then I would had pointed it at their house and let it fly. Then go inside and called the cops.", "You know you're not.", "NTA They could have started a fire and killed someone!!! You did the right thing, and I would have done the same thing! As soon as they started aiming at houses, they became AHs that are endangering the public. Neighbor complains again say that you saved the neighborhood houses and lives.", "My friends literally lost their house this past summer to someone doing something similar. \n\nNTA", "Are you the asshole for reporting attempted arson and threatened violence to the police? No. NTA. But if you feel you need to have CCTV *in your home* for \u201csafety reasons,\u201d maybe you should move?", "NTA- I only wish the police in my city did the same for the losers lighting off fireworks on my street, but they\u2019re friends", "NTA if they didn't do anything wrong than there would be a problem", "NTA. Bonfire night brings out the stupid in a lot of people.", "NTA.  My neighbor\u2019s house caught on fire from some nimrod shooting off fireworks in New Years.  The family had to move out, and have Half the house taken down to the studs.  It it took 9 months to rebuild and who knows how much time and energy and ruined belongings, including sentimental items.   No fireworks ordinances exist for a reason.  And that was accidental.  Your neighbors are straight up evil, threatening to shoot fireworks at you!\n\nI am glad that you are ok, OP.  I hope they go to jail.", "NTA. I work in surgery. We get people who loses eyes, fingers, hands from fireworks. They are explosives and dangerous", "THIS. NTA, but your neighbors certainly are. You did everyone else in the neighborhood a favor by calling the police.", "What if a window had been open and a firework flew inside the house? Such dangerous behaviour from immature people. They deserve to have the cops called on them.", "If I knew i wasn't, I'm sure I wouldn't of posted it here asking ngl", "When I said for safety reasons, I meant just in case someone broke in, that's not likely to happen I think, but it's better to be safe then sorry", "[deleted]", "Tell us more about bomb fire night. Are you in Ukraine?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. Anyone who aims fireworks at property deserves to be taken away.", "NTA. 2021 consumer product safety commission reports say there were 9 deaths and 11,500 estimated injuries from fireworks in the ER.", "No lmao, nta, they made their bed and now they get to lie in it. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "That\u2019s a great way to start a house on fire. What total idiots. You\u2019re NTA you did exactly what you should do.", "They're lucky they didn't do that to me. My \ud83d\udd2b are louder.", "NTA\n\nplus i would probably call the police again for verbal. abuse", "NTA - what they were doing was dangerous and completely inappropriate. You did the right thing by yourself and your other neighbors. And honestly - probably for them too. They could have hurt themselves or someone else.", "NTA they could have literally killed someone", "Not only is this scaring other people its also a fire hazard! NTA at all.", "NTA and I'd be ringing the police back about their friend.", "NTA they could have easily caused fire. They should be locked in jail to teach them some lessons.", "NTA Keep a dated and timed record of everything. Keep safe.", "And when that person came threatening you (because that is what they are doing) - you call the police again..\n\nNTA\n\nSeriously - who tries to set fire to homes with fireworks.. (because that can happen, has happened before, and will most likely happen again when idiots get their paws on incendiary devices)", "NTA \n\nThey could have burned your house down. And they threatened you. they got what they deserved.", "Nta I've been to a party where a stray firework set a house on fire.", "NTA", "NTA. I'd be making another call and show the footage.", "NTA and love the 'bomb fire' typo, kinda apt", "NTA tell any more friends that arrive you will be making another complaint for witness intimidation of they don't disappear.", "I seriously doubt that, although it could have easily been the result. \n\"Never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by stupidity.\"\nBut I guess it fits this sub to always assume the worst.\n\n\nYou can downvote all you want but I speak from experience here.", "NTA That happened in a city near mine a few years ago around the 4th of July. And that firework wasn\u2019t even aimed at a house, they were being set off in the street, one just happened to land on the roof of an older house. I think 2-3 other houses burned down in addition to the one that initially caught. They were all multi-family homes so a few dozen people became homeless due to one careless act.", " I am not in Ukraine, I'm in the UK (not England or London)", "Look up Guy Fawkes. In the UK we celebrate a man who tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament!", "A lot of people have security cameras for these types of reasons. It's not just about catching burglars.", "Sorry for the typo, when I was writing this, I was tired lol", "Yeah call them again, get protection order. Doubt they have a job but itll be harder to find one after that", "Did you miss the part where they threatened op and then proceeded to harass him afterwards?", "> You can downvote all you want but I speak from experience here\n\nExperience in what? Being unable to read an entire story that is all of one paragraph long?"]}
