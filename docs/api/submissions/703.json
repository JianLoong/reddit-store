I also would have called on their friends for coming over and harassing me.", "NTA. Once you start aiming at houses, you can fuck all the way off.", "NTA. They are actually trying to hurt people or damage property they deserved to get in trouble.", "Holy crap NTA let\u2019s be very clear here, they could have hit someone and blown a finger off, they could have started a fire. You were kind at first but then when you couldn\u2019t work things out nicely you called the cops. Their friend sounds like a piece of work too. I\u2019d keep the footage of the friend coming over as evidence. You hopefully won\u2019t need it but better save than sorry.", "NTA. These people are psychos.\n\nYou probs have grounds for a protection order if they keep fucking with you", "NTA\nYou clearly asked for them to stop and they were only doing it with the intention to hurt others. You did the right thing, plus it\u2019ll be a good start for a paper trail if they try to harass you over it", "NTA\n\nThis is not just a noise or rudeness issue, this is a real danger that needed to be stopped for everyone safety. This was criminal behavior!", "Not the Ahole.  If they're aiming the firworks AT the houses, it could have been a very devastating situation if one (or more) of the houses caught fire.  The neighbours were the a-holes not you.", "NTA. They could have literally killed someone", "NTA you asked nicely first. They not only ignored you, they threatened you. Misplaced fireworks can go very wrong. They are lucky they didn\u2019t start a house fire. I wonder if attempted arson is a thing? Reckless endangerment certainly is.", "NTA That's a threat to public safety and a so incredibly irresponsible! Anyone on the local fire department will agree!Not to mention fireworks are nice(?)...on occasion...when planned. But if your neighbors are just lighting them off at all times of the year ugh, i'd be so upset in that situation. Tell me you have no regard for your neighbor's quality of life without telling me... just light off some fireworks jeez.Not to mention the damage they cause to wildlife, pets and people with Ptsd. I think you did the neighborhood a favor.", "These guys are losers man, I'd file a report if any of them come back. People like this don't learn by asking nicely or talking to them. Don't interact with them, report and record everything by them. Make sure anything valuable you keep outside has a camera on it too. NTA op, your shitty neighbors are though", "ynta i would have done the same thing", "Nope. NTA", "Goodness no you are NTA!  It\u2019s scary to have neighbors like this. Keep those cameras working and don\u2019t hesitate to report anything they do or say and document everything", "Being the passive-aggressive person that I can be at times I would have asked them if I could fire one off, then I would had pointed it at their house and let it fly. Then go inside and called the cops.", "You know you're not.", "NTA They could have started a fire and killed someone!!! You did the right thing, and I would have done the same thing! As soon as they started aiming at houses, they became AHs that are endangering the public. Neighbor complains again say that you saved the neighborhood houses and lives.", "My friends literally lost their house this past summer to someone doing something similar. \n\nNTA", "Are you the asshole for reporting attempted arson and threatened violence to the police? No. NTA. But if you feel you need to have CCTV *in your home* for \u201csafety reasons,\u201d maybe you should move?", "NTA- I only wish the police in my city did the same for the losers lighting off fireworks on my street, but they\u2019re friends", "NTA if they didn't do anything wrong than there would be a problem", "NTA. Bonfire night brings out the stupid in a lot of people.", "NTA.  My neighbor\u2019s house caught on fire from some nimrod shooting off fireworks in New Years.  The family had to move out, and have Half the house taken down to the studs.  It it took 9 months to rebuild and who knows how much time and energy and ruined belongings, including sentimental items.   No fireworks ordinances exist for a reason.  And that was accidental.  Your neighbors are straight up evil, threatening to shoot fireworks at you!\n\nI am glad that you are ok, OP.  I hope they go to jail.", "NTA. I work in surgery. We get people who loses eyes, fingers, hands from fireworks. They are explosives and dangerous", "THIS. NTA, but your neighbors certainly are. You did everyone else in the neighborhood a favor by calling the police.", "What if a window had been open and a firework flew inside the house? Such dangerous behaviour from immature people. They deserve to have the cops called on them.", "If I knew i wasn't, I'm sure I wouldn't of posted it here asking ngl", "When I said for safety reasons, I meant just in case someone broke in, that's not likely to happen I think, but it's better to be safe then sorry", "So people are threatening public safety by acting like delinquents and SHOOTING FIREWORKS AT HOUSES and you call the police on them for dangerous behaviour. How do you not know you're nta?"]}
