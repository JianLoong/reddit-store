One, despite the tone in the post, I don't know- but closet hiding and food sneaking is maybe not as endearing as you think &  seems a fairly weird dynamic on both sides.", "NTA\n\nHe's just mad that he got caught.

He's been cheating his own rule but you hid in a closet to see how he prepared the plates. Verdict: Husband=AH. Wife= weird", "NAH\n\nOk. The thing is, I grew up with a few kids whose parents fostered kids. And while it\u2019s a super noble thing\u2026\n\nThey grew up in carefully managed households where treats ended up being more of a chore than anything else. It was constant sharing and constant \u201cdowngrading\u201d of treats to ensure their large families could manage. \n\nI will sound awful for this but my opinion is that jt can be quite detrimental for kids to grow up when their parents choose to foster. I\u2019m also not a fan of large families of bio kids either; it simply creates a challenging and competitive environment. \n\nLet me clarify that I\u2019m not against fostering. I\u2019m saying it can impact the permanently placed/bio kids negatively. Let\u2019s remember, foster care is extremely unstable and challenging for the children in the system. That does extend, to a lesser but valid amount, to all the kids involved. \n\nHe\u2019s technically wrong for what he\u2019s been doing. Absolutely.

Your husband was being a prized hypocrite, and you caught him in the act!!

This definitely isn\u2019t the cutesy innocent argument op thinks it is. \n\n\nIt also seriously rubs me the wrong way that OP\u2019s husband says OP was an as much of an ass for spying.
