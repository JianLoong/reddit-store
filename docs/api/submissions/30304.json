A perfect time to teach her that there\u2019s a time and a place for retouches it should not be done in class, in conversation or obviously. Retouches are done in a bathroom mirror when the chance arises", "NTA for buying her nice things, but damn, why does a 13yo need to bring her makeup to school for \u2018retouches\u2019? She\u2019s there to learn, she should leave it at home. \n\nIf she wants to avoid middle school drama, remove what\u2019s causing the drama.", "NTA - good moment to tesch her that she should never be ashamed of who she is. There is nothing wrong with having something nice.\n\nNow... acting high and mighty about it (if that is what she was doing.... bragging about it) is not okay. If so, another good teachable moment for her.\n\nBut man, never be ashamed of buying something nice.", "\nYou need to teach her that there's a time and place for makeup retouches.  Why is her lipstick and eyeliner fading during class? High-quality makeup should be lasting most of the day. If her teachers are noticing, then she's disrupting class in order to show off, and that's definitely veering into AH territory. Save the retouches for the bathroom mirror after lunch, and keep it in her purse during class.\n\nNTA for buying her nice things", "Is it really appropriate for a 13 year old to bring lipstick to school? What stands out to me is that a 13 year old is feeling the need to top up their make up in school. Maybe this is just my age and where I live!", "NTA - For buying her luxury make up and nice things but I personally think at 13 it's a little young for her to be wearing lipstick to school. \n\nAt 15/16 would be a more appropriate age, I think. The last thing she needs to be concerned about is her appearance at school when she should enjoy being a child and studying. All this can come later.\n\nI also think the other kids could be jealous of your daughter who is fortunate to have nice make up brands. Kids are shitty at that age, tell her to ignore them and to only touch up in the in the bathroom where it would cause less chances of her being teased perhaps? \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. Just let her know that showing off her expensive lipstick is bad manners, and showing off anything that is expensive or hard to get is bad manners, and that's why she's being given a hard time.", "NTA. This seems like a middle school thing. Cruelty reigns and some of the comments may be because the other girls are jealous. I would have her just keep it at home.", "You\u2019re NTA for buying your daughter a nice lipstick", "Honestly slight YTA for not teaching her beforehand not to show off and be obnoxious. It\u2019s perfectly nice to get her lipstick that\u2019s your choice as a parent though my parents had a rule that non essentials like makeup were to be bought and paid for with my own money if it\u2019s not my birthday or Christmas. That being said a child does not need luxury brands for touch ups in 8th grade math. If the lipstick is more than $50 she should not be bringing it to school anyway, children lose things all of the time.", "NTA obviously.  Bullies find all sorts of reasons to go at other kids.\n\nAssuming you discussed the bullying with the teacher/school already, then I think it's your daughter's decision on how to go forward (ignoring the comments, not using the makeup at school, changing to a different brand, etc.)", "Info: Define luxury. What brands and are you really sure these are drastically more ethical? \n\nI mean there is high end and then there is luxury and yeah, it is kind of unreasonable to be spending $75+ on lipstick for a child.", "NTA. If kids are just jealous, that sucks. If your daughter is being silly and trying to show off obviously all the time, then of course the other kids will give her grief and she should cut out that kind of behaviour.", "NTA, she likes it and is showing people the way most kids do with anything they are happy about. So long as you are instilling in her that it doesn't make her better than others just cause she can get the nice expensive stuff this should be a non issue.", "NTA\n\nWhy is the school ok with bullying? Yes, silly name calling is just annoying, but why is some bullying ignored? Doesn't that often get people to test the boundaries - \"if I can get away with X, then maybe I can do Y or Z\"? Also, I assume if she made up names for those taunting her, that she would get talked to by the school? \n\nAs a separate issue, if she needs to touch up her makeup so often that it has become such a noticeable thing, it presumably is a distraction. I thought such things are limited to breaks between class or recess/lunch? \n\nBoth problems need to be addressed separately so nobody gets confused over the idea that the one issue excuses the other.", "NTA for what you did, but your daughter may be acting like an asshole at school with it.", "Did you buy your daughter 300 dollar Chanel lipstick (or the equivalence ),and she brought it to school for \u201ctouch ups\u201d and the girls bullied her? Gee mom, I wonder why?  YTA", "NAH but tell her to quit playing with it at school.", "NTA-  your daughter kept showing it off even though she was not getting a good reaction.  The school does it's best, but if your daughter keeps pushing it....", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"When I discussed this with her teacher, and I understand teachers have it hard, she claimed my daughter pulls it out often and was showing\" .. report tthe teacher. This is no excuse to allow bullying.", "YTA not for buying her makeup but for allowing her to wear and take it to school. Is that even allowed in the school's dress code?", "NTA! I would\u2019ve LOVED for my parents to have gotten me nice makeup in middle school. That\u2019s the time when you can experiment! My mom only ever bought me \u201cboring\u201d makeup and to this day I have NO idea how to apply product or even have a makeup brand preference. I feel so behind. This is a mom win imo\n\nETA: I went to NYC in high school and bought a Chanel lipgloss and I felt so confident. I love the idea of instilling good consumer practices early w brands/quality (not saying Chanel is a good brand but def luxury)", "NTA you got her something nice and that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nShe\u2019s just showing off (like kids do) and it being a name brand just made her seem more snobbish I imagine. Now she\u2019s getting called names.", "YTA for having her bring the shot to school. She\u2019s there to learn not impress the boys.", "I mean I woulda told my kid to tell them to fuck off and stop patronizing her for having nice things just because they didnt have them but I was unfortunately the loud mouth at that age and woulda wound up in a fist fight  lol", "NTA and don\u2019t worry too much about it. She\u2019s just figuring stuff out. Like if you have a thing and then you act like an AH about having a thing people will let you know and you can adjust your behavior accordingly. It\u2019s important stuff. Let her learn it. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to offer her some loving guidance about what actions & behaviors she wants to display for public judgement and what she doesn\u2019t. How she wants to be perceived and the healthy management of and response to other people\u2019s opinions of her. Which is pretty important stuff for a 13 year old to work out. but this isn\u2019t about a lipstick or you buying it for her. Obviously.", "These kids impress me nowadays. I was only allowed to wear lipgloss and nail polish until i was 17 and my sister did my prom makeup lmao. Why does she need to retouch her makeup? Kids at my school wore pajamas and bed hair. Most of us slept in class and woke up with dried up drool on our faces lmao. We walked around sweaty from gym class cause 5 minutes wasn\u2019t enough time to shower and change. YTA because being \u201con fleek\u201d isn\u2019t gonna get your daughter far in life. It won\u2019t get the bully far either. You\u2019re there to learn.

I also find they really aren\u2019t necessary usually unless you\u2019ve been eating. But then, I never liked eye makeup much so maybe I\u2019m biased. \n\nIt does sound like OP\u2019s daughter (and her peers) are just now entering that phase where they\u2019re really appearance conscious. I think during that period girls never feel like they\u2019re doing the \u2018right thing\u2019 and are really conscious of not only wearing makeup but the best way to apply makeup in order to fit in (as a former teenage girl). It\u2019s a really hard age. All of this was true for me and my friend group, but I\u2019m not saying it is for everyone.", "I am wondering if you\u2019ve ever worn lipstick before? She doesn\u2019t need to be pulling it out in class, but if she\u2019s wearing it to school it is a good idea to bring it to school to reapply after lunch because no lipstick in the universe is going to look okay at all after eating a meal. Touch ups after eating is just a part of wearing lipstick.", "Agreed. NTA, but talk to your daughter about this.", "Uh, I don't know if you know this, but the vast majority of lipstick wearers, especially younger people who don't know the tricks of long-wear application, need to reapply after they eat. 13 year olds generally eat lunch during the school day.\n\nWalking around with half a mouth of lipstick, or having to wipe it off at midday but you don't have makeup remover so it's still staining your lips, is mortifying at most ages, but especially for a 13 year old. It's not like she's spending an hour doing touch ups before photos, it's more like 30 seconds in the bathroom mirror between class periods.", "That's horrible advice because now the bullies know she's a good target they can break down.", "No. \n\nIf kids are bullying a kid they need to stop bullying a kid. The person being bullied doesn't need to change their behavior in order to be treated well. \n\nUnless her touching up her lipstick is preventing her from doing her work, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Dior lipstick is similarly priced, Givenchi, Aramni, YSL, same.   Proportionate to what other people use it might be very expensive, but we're not talking the same cost as a Chromebook, here.", "Why does a luxury brand lipstick need retouching so often that everyone (including her teachers) is commenting on it?

There are a lot of people ITT who don\u2019t seem to know what lipstick costs. Even in Canada a nice Chanel lipstick is $50ish, which is spendy but a reasonable indulgence if you can afford it.", "Exactly. And if OPs daughter stops using makeup or stops bringing it, they will bully her for that. And then when the bullies start using makeup and bringing it out in class (which they will) they will bulky her for not doing so.
