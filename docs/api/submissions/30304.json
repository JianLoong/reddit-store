All this can come later.\n\nI also think the other kids could be jealous of your daughter who is fortunate to have nice make up brands.

Yes, silly name calling is just annoying, but why is some bullying ignored? Doesn't that often get people to test the boundaries - \"if I can get away with X, then maybe I can do Y or Z\"? Also, I assume if she made up names for those taunting her, that she would get talked to by the school? \n\nAs a separate issue, if she needs to touch up her makeup so often that it has become such a noticeable thing, it presumably is a distraction.

I started wearing makeup to school at her age and I always left it at home, you don't need to reapply makeup every few hours (and if it's really expensive makeup then it shouldn't be fading until she gets home anyway unless she's dumping water all over her face). Second, there are plenty of makeup brands that are ethical and aren't very expensive. I wear expensive makeup myself, but that's because I just like the products a lot after trying out a ton of different ones. Most of it is made by an ethical company but the few things I have that are the most expensive are not made by ethical companies, unlike a couple of the very inexpensive products I have. She's 13, she doesn't need $45 lipstick and you could easily find $10 lipstick for her that is cruelty-free and ethically sourced.

Teachers didn\u2019t care and it\u2019s one of the strictest schools in the district. It\u2019s common for this age. If she just started getting into makeup she may not realize how often she needs to use it/maintain it. Just teach her.

Only reason would be to seek a mirror, but there are those hand-held thingies, you know\u2026)\n\nMy guess is: OP\u2018s daughter wanted to belong, she copied the other girl\u2019s behavior, the other kids got jealous at the high quality stuff she has and turned it against her. The teacher is so annoyed with the make-up behavior that the girls show anyways and will not go out of her way to call this out as the bullying it is.

First off all I do want to add I don't have all the info, also kids suck and will bully for something that deviates from the group. I don't know how expensive the lipstick is, but I do generally recommend to give kids more cheaper products. They can loose things, and when they have an allowence they can buy it themselves more easily. Second lots of good make up are from cheaper brands. It is something to try out as well.  \n\nAlso I don't agree with the 'she is 13 why is she wearing make up, she will be insecure etc etc.'. No. The thing is you can learn to have a healthy relationship with make up. Make up at a young age just doesn't equal insecurity. OP remember to teach your girl that make up is always to compliment the features we have and is also a form of self expression. Make up should be fun. I started make up at the age of 11. Yes it is young, nobody pressured me. My mom is a big make up fan and loves it. I looked up to my mom and wanted to wear some as well. It has been my daily hobby since. Never did I use it as a cover up of who I am (unless you are a pimple, but that is different haha). I got bullied from it, simply because I was different. I was told as well that I showed off or that I looked ugly (I was litterly just wearing mascara might I add). Again I see it as a form of art, self expression, and extension of me. Teach a healthy relationsship with make up is very important and have fun with it as well.", "NTA\nYour daughter is a teen and is most likely flexing the brand, which isn't harmful to do and it's just teen shit.

I'd tell your daughter that they are probably just jealous, and to ignore it because if she dosent react they'll get bored and stop when they realise they won't get a reaction. And maybe do fuller makeup at home or when you go out, and keep a school kit of mascara, maybe eyeliner and a nice clear or sheer pink gloss, so she can still wear makeup if she feels like it, but it might just be toned down enough for people not to care. But yeah, they are most likely jealous and lashing out because they are jealous, id also remind your daughter that give it a few weeks and it'll be but a memory, give it a year and she won't even think about it.

I remember middle school, and I remember the girls who started wearing makeup and carrying their lipstick/lip gloss and eyeliner with them.

Someone here said \"eventually the novelty will wear off\" and that's true. She's a new teen trying new things she's excited about. She'll find another student doing the same thing and will hear the same teasing. And that's all it is: teasing. She needs to stand strong in who she is and eventually she'll find it doesn't matter what the others are saying. She would be getting the same teasing using drug store makeup, honestly. She'll find her groove and be fine, mama just needs to remind her of that and all will be well.

I had a classmate that sat next to me and did her makeup every day in homeroom and sometimes the boys teased her and it made her upset. Eventually she got over it and and the boys found it wasn't so fun to tease her anymore. Just let the kids be kids for now, they'll sort themselves out.

I absolutely was the type of girl who would do retouches in class if it was a quiet moment. Like we were supposed to be reading or something. I didn't show off. I tried to do it as low key as possible. Ex: behind textbooks or folders, etc. At my school (and many others have said this over the years) we just didn't have enough time between classes to run to the bathroom, go to our locker to get the next textbook, and then make it to the next class on time. You had to pick and choose which activities you could do before each class depending on locations of the classroom and it's distance from your locker. I grew up to doing touch ups in public if necessary. There is nothing wrong with it. It's makeup. Everyone is acting like it's something indecent.\n  Imo if your child wasn't being bullied about this she would be bullied about something. Idk kids are mean to each other but they are. When my daughter first went to kindergarten some kid started calling her Sami Starfish. And it became a thing. When my daughter first told me I had to stifle a laugh. Because even though I actually thought it was so cute, it upset her. Of course over the years it definitely got worse. One thing that really blew my mind is how over the years the \"nerds\" really fought back and became the bulliers instead of the bullied. My daughter was bullied for NOT wearing glasses. So she would wear her hair in front of her left eye to ruin her eyesight ON PURPOSE. It worked too. \n  With all that being said it's not right. No one should belittle anyone for any reason. This is being done out of jealousy obviously. You might tell your daughter that. And ask her how she wants to handle it. Whether she ignores them, changes her behavior (where she retouches her makeup), or she talks some smak back, etc. Give her some of her power back. Hopefully she has a friend(s) who aren't joining in and have her back. But even if she doesn't she has you. I'm the type of parent who would make myself the teachers headache until they addressed the issue with the bullies.\n  Anyway you handle it much love to you and your daughter.

It's totally normal for a child to show and tell to their friends, they are excited for their new thing. But discussing behavior around the use of it is important.

If i is  that she is doing it every day at the start and end of class, that isn't a class disruption by her. \n\n2. Is it a disruption because of the other children? If the issue is that class is being disrupted because she is being teased or bullied for the lipstic, then that is a separate issue to solve.

Hopefully, that would be addressing the behavior of the people doing the teasing and having them stop their behavior. \n\n3. If the teacher and parent finds the ideal way to handle this is to address this on both sides of the equation (which personally is how I would handle it as a mom and teacher) I would suggest rules that are for everyone are the best step forward. Having a classroom rule that things like makeup aren't for classroom time or are only for the last 5min of time before dismissal or whatever would be the most efficient and equitable way of handling things. And a rule to make \"nicknames\" off limits unless the other student says it is ok. \n\n6.
