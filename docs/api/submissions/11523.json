Erroneously I responded I had forgotten about their little BBQ get together and I would change my other plans. Again, my phone calendar has not been populating from my computer.

They have been partners close to twenty years at this point and I consider them basically married for all intents and purposes. \n\nI am finding, however, now that the event is over, my daughter has told me she didn\u2019t like the way I spoke about the wedding or reception. In particular she did not like that I referred to their party as a BBQ apparently. I find that since their father and I divorced that all the fault lies with me in my children\u2019s eyes.
