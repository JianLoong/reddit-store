Erroneously I responded I had forgotten about their little BBQ get together and I would change my other plans. Again, my phone calendar has not been populating from my computer.

We really need to stop putting an expiration date on people\u2019s health/memory just because of age.", "I am close to 50 and I can assure you I am perfectly capable of forgetting important dates. When I was younger it never used to be the case. Just this morning I realized that we missed our wedding anniversary by a few days. It was our 25th\u2026", "Theres plenty of room for both", "It\u2019s weird because everything about the post screamed gay son whose relationship of 20 years I have never respected to me. The whole thing was so clear when I was reading the post.", "But her mother was too so she couldn't possibly be tokenizing anyone ever and is definitely not homophobic. /s", "She says in another comment \n\n> It doesn't matter if he is gay. My mother is as well. She raised me as a single mother for a long time and eventually we lived with her partner. As such, I only have respect for the LGBT community. I understand the bullying and the hatred, having experienced a touch of it myself.", "I don't have experience or much knowledge sbout NPD, thank you for that explanation", "That was totally my impression", "I mean she seems to accept their relationship because she says they've been together for more than 20 years and in her eyes already married. I'm not ruling out homophobia per se, but maybe the fundamental issue is OPs general ignorance and dismissal of her son's feelings; I think OP lacks emotional intelligence and her son has known that from very early on and doesn't even try to talk to her about it anymore.", "Literally the only reason I didn\u2019t have one for mine was because we went to the venue and stayed there the night before. Even I couldn\u2019t miss that what with our whole wedding party staying with us.", "this! I have a calendar notification to help me remember my own anniversary. its the same day, every year, but it slips me by because im bad with dates. \n\ntheres no shame in needing a calendar, its a very useful tool and it\u2019s literally what its there for, but the wording comes across as disrespectful", "Yeah, but OP states she scheduled over it more than once. You would think that if you make that mistake once you would either stick in your mind (3rd weekend in June) or just add it to your phone, but no, OP doesn't add it to her phone and schedules a conflict a couple more times? If I were her child, it would sound like OP is sending me a message that she thinks my little BBQ event is silly.\n\nAnd lo and behold, OP admits she doesn't think it is important and is resentful that she isn't involved (in control?) in the planning.", "I hate that you\u2019re getting downvoted for this. I have ADHD and I absolutely need a calendar to remember important dates, including my own wedding anniversary. \n\nOP is TA for referring to it as her son\u2019s \u201clittle barbecue\u201d and being condescending as hell, which is probably why her son doesn\u2019t speak to her much. But not for needing help remembering dates, tf?", "> And i know plenty of people in 30s who doesnt remember that tomortow is public holiday = office will be closed.\n\nWhat do you think has more emotional impact, your child getting married or a random public holiday.", "This is what I noticed too.", "I don\u2019t consider her a reliable narrator.", "Oh yeah, like I said, the issue is she's being dismissive. She's absolutely TA, 100%. Regardless of using a calendar or not, she's minimizing the wedding and acting like because she's not involved (even though traditionally, the mother of the groom has a fairly minimal role in planning anyway) and it's a small wedding (which, in this economy, unless you have the budget to set 30k on fire... Why have a big wedding), that it doesn't matter. And that's the core of the issue.", "And that is reason why OP is AH. And exactly what OP asked if the way she called wedding is.\n\nOP memory/ cognitive ability shouldnt be an argument here. OP didnt ask about it & who we are to say it isnt real.\n\nOf course, this is where people downvote on a mere stimulating question. What was i thinking?", "Thanks for the comment. I'm a little puzzling why it was downvote. \n\nAlmost as if im not allowed to have opinion. It make me questioned if \"post it\" was even real.", "Imho, not a what but when.\n\nAnd it was just an example of possibilty that \"forgetting\" could be real regardless of age.", "I think it's something else. I'm sure he is gay, but there's something else she's not saying", "The point is that people remember things that are more important to them.", "She wasn\u2019t invited to the courthouse ceremony is my bet.", "If this is the only truth. Does it mean that people that need help reminding them of anniversaries dont think those events important to them?", "Why? This post is textbook \"Missing Reasons\""]}
