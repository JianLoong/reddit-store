You know you did the right thing. I have 31 years straight and sober, but I started right where you are, feeling like I was heading out without a map. One of the most difficult things in early sobriety is when you have to cut those close to you out, often because your sobriety forces them to put a spotlight on themselves. They see things in themselves they don't want to see. This means they are the ones who have the most investment in you remaining as you were, and they will try everything to sabotage you. The irony is that they frequently don't even realize what they are doing. It's not logical, but it's common.

You are responsible for your addiction. \n\nHowever, that means getting rid of the Xanax. This whole post boils down to you not wanting to get rid of it. It's time for it to go.", "I keep all of my extra meds just in case. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good/safe idea to self-medicate with non-prescribed drugs.", "It sounds like your mom has a substance abuse issue? You may have gotten this from her.", "Seconded, it definitely seems to fall under that projection umbrella. Hell, she almost literally used the \"it's not like I'm [the exact thing the speaker is]\" liar's reflex.", "I got rid of the Xanax as stated at the bottom of my post. I know I am responsible for my addiction/recovery and I am working on that. \n\nGiving a child a controlled substance wasn\u2019t a great move on her part, though. I\u2019ve never blamed her for my addiction and I never will. But I wish I had never experienced what a benzo felt like, especially at that age. It taught me that feelings can be dealt with with substances instead of learning to properly cope with them.", "Yeah that's exactly what I heard when I was reading through. I pretty much interpreted the conversation with Mom like this:\n\nOP: I [do] have old xanax that I am trying to get disposed of properly! \n\nM: you should give me the xans :) \n\nOP: No, I'm going to get them disposed of properly. \n\nM: YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME THE XANAX?? EVEN THOUGH **YOU** WERE AN ADDICT AND **I** WASN'T?? EVEN THOUGH YOU STOLE PILLS FROM ME WHEN YOU WERE IN ACTIVE ADDICTION???\n\nOP:....\n\nM: YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE AN ADDICT. YOU'RE ALWAYS- (I started hearing the \"Waa Waa Waaaa\" from The Peanuts) \n\nOP: It's not safe-\n\nM: I WANT THEM!!! YOU'RE LYING ABOUT POSSIBLE ABUSE I PUT YOU THROUGH!! YOU'RE JUST AN ADDICTED LIAR!!\n------", "The fact that she\u2019s now denying it / attempting to gaslight you about this probably indicates she knows she did something wrong and regrets it, even if only subconsciously", "I'm not saying it's great for her to have done that, but there's still not a lot of information out about that. My mother did the same thing when I was a kid and I've dealt with wanting to always be medicated too. However, a doctor would have prescribed you controlled substances at some point. So many places were just sued over how easily they give them + telling others how safe they are."]}
