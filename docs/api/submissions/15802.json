If she needs the meds let her get them prescribed. Well done on your seven days.", "NTA. Meds are prescribed for you and for you only. And especially Xanax isn't candy you can just hand out.\n\nThe fact that you stole meds from her in the past has nothing to do with that. In fact, reconsider how often you see your mother if she's continuously going to bring up your past to get something from you.", "NTA. You acted responsibly, and I\u2019m not sure how old you are, but your mother seems to treat you like a child still. Good luck on your recovery.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations.  Addiction is hard and I commend you for choosing sober living today.  It sounds like your mom is an enabler.  It might be hard for you to maintain a close relationship knowing that she is also abusing medications that are not prescribed to her.  I don't knowi if you are going to meetings/counseling but if you are maybe invite your mom along for the experience, and maybe a heart to heart about the best ways she can support your sobriety.  Best of luck to you!", "NTA. It\u2019s inappropriate for your mother (or anyone) to ask for prescription medication from you. \n\nAs you evolve in your recovery, you\u2019ll find it gets less challenging to navigate conflict. This conversation devolved into score keeping which never feels good. The response to her request could have been, \u201cI\u2019m trying to develop habits that will keep me in recovery. Exchanging prescription pills is something I used to do, but no longer. Turning these into the police is a step I need to take to be healthier. Please respect that.\u201d", "NTA, pretty sure it is illegal to give someone else prescribed drugs.", "NTA and I'm proud of you!!!!   For standing up to her.  For doing the right thing.  Mostly for SEVEN days!!!   The first week is the hardest, you got this!!!!", "NTA. But I\u2019m wondering, is the drug you previously took from her also Xanax? \n\nIf so, she can get a prescription filled herself. \nIf not, that\u2019s *very* concerning.", "Info: why did she ask you for the drugs? To take them for her own personal consumption or because she doesn\u2019t want a daughter in early recovery to have a highly addictive substance in her apartment?", "Firstly, congratulations on the first 7 days. The beginning of recovery is  so hard. I'm not your mum, but I'm a mum, I want you to know how proud I am of you. \nI'm sorry your mum isn't as supportive as she should be, but you have done the right thing", "NTA. You acted responsibly and in accordance with your treatment. I am concerned by your mother's behavior, though. Congratulations on 7 days sober! That's no easy feat. Keep up the hard work.", "My mother also has this belief it is a good idea to save painkillers. It's not! You may or may not be generalizing, and have made a decision about your responsibility for community and well being. It is your decision to make. Nta\n\n(Edit:) Sorry you had two things get mixed up in your situation.", "NTA. Whether she\u2019s an addict or not doesn\u2019t matter. Even having this awful conversation with anyone is asshole move, but with a very newly sober person is colossal monumental asshole behavior. It feels like sabotage. \n\nIt seems to me that mommy dearest isn\u2019t conducive to your recovery, and you may want to take a bit of a timeout from her. She doesn\u2019t seem to have your best interest at heart.", "NTA.\n\n(Firstly: So proud of you for taking those first steps, even prouder that despite your mother's cruel words you stuck at it and I wish you the best in your recovery journey darling.)\n\nIn light of that, kicking someone while they're in the very vulnerable state of committing to recovery is such a low blow and totally uncalled for. Yes, there's been history when you were in active addiction but it's so senselessly cruel to throw that in your face when you've made the decision to change your behaviour. \n\nIf she had asked for the drugs as a safeguard FOR YOU, as in worried you may take them and fall back into addiction, I'd be leaning more towards a different judgement but that isn't the case here. \n\nI hope you have other people in your life that are supporting you through this, chasing maternal love can become as much of an ingrained behaviour as addiction and when you aren't getting the return it can lead to dark places. Don't let her break you, and best of luck with everything \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, not by a long shot. Wishing you strength in your recovery, well done for taking these important steps.", "This was a perfect response! NTA at all! I'm proud of you!", "NTA - sharing prescription medications is illegal in some regions. \nHood luck with the sobriety, you're doing great.", "NTA\n\nNever give your prescription drugs to anyone. This is the right course of action.", "NTA. I get why she would be concerned, especially since it's still a relatively new phase of your life, but she could have asked if you'd like you to go out for coffee or lunch and dispose of it. Basically make a date of it while making a really nice memory.\n\nI hope and pray that you keep getting better OP, and that you stay strong! You're not going through this alone. :)", "NTA. Your mom sounds extremely manipulative.\n\nI\u2019m glad you were able to dispose of them safely and hope things only look up from here.", "NTA- Agree with the posts saying that trading prescription pills is not good for your sobriety, you are absolutely right to hold your boundary.  Your mother\u2019s request was completely inappropriate. \n\nAlso some encouragement from someone who\u2019s been there- 7 days is AMAZING! You are going to have lots of big feelings during this time, so congratulations on navigating a difficult situation. It will get much, much easier, and it\u2019s definitely better on this side.", "NTA. It's really never ok to give someone else your own prescription and you did the right thing to dispose of it appropriately. End of story. I'm sorry for the conflict with your mom - she seems like she might be a pretty unhealthy influence in your life with respect to the relationship with substances and other things.", "Congrats on your recovery!", "She is saying exactly what a drug dealer or addict would say. Congratulations on your first Big test! There will be plenty but you got this!", "NTA\n\nSo your mother claims not to be an addict, makes you feel bad for being an addict in the past while acting like an addict herself??\n\nThe audacity.", "NTA she should go get her own prescription", "NTA. Good for you to stand your ground! What she said was beyond cruel and you DID NOT deserve it. I\u2019m very proud of you, this is a big deal.

Neither of which she has an ongoing prescription for- she kept the medications after dental/medical procedures. So she cannot get those refilled. \n\nI still feel horrible for my past actions and have actually asked her forgiveness before. I suppose she still has resentments about the whole situation which is fair.", "Thank you for your question. She told me she wanted them for herself, in case she needed them.", "We never used together. As far as I know, she doesn\u2019t have issues with substance use.

I stole from her maybe ~10 years ago", "Then she has no need for Xanax and it\u2019s concerning for to even ask. Your mother should be supporting you in your recovery, not using it as an opportunity to grab free drugs. I wish you luck in your journey.", "Yeah NTA.

Nope, SHE displayed addict behavior and look at you at 7 days sober doing the right thing, I'm so proud of you! Keep walking your sober journey.", "Thank you, I appreciate it!"]}
