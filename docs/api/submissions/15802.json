You know you did the right thing. I have 31 years straight and sober, but I started right where you are, feeling like I was heading out without a map. One of the most difficult things in early sobriety is when you have to cut those close to you out, often because your sobriety forces them to put a spotlight on themselves. They see things in themselves they don't want to see. This means they are the ones who have the most investment in you remaining as you were, and they will try everything to sabotage you. The irony is that they frequently don't even realize what they are doing. It's not logical, but it's common.
