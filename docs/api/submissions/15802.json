Yes, there's been history when you were in active addiction but it's so senselessly cruel to throw that in your face when you've made the decision to change your behaviour. \n\nIf she had asked for the drugs as a safeguard FOR YOU, as in worried you may take them and fall back into addiction, I'd be leaning more towards a different judgement but that isn't the case here. \n\nI hope you have other people in your life that are supporting you through this, chasing maternal love can become as much of an ingrained behaviour as addiction and when you aren't getting the return it can lead to dark places.

You know you did the right thing. I have 31 years straight and sober, but I started right where you are, feeling like I was heading out without a map. One of the most difficult things in early sobriety is when you have to cut those close to you out, often because your sobriety forces them to put a spotlight on themselves. They see things in themselves they don't want to see. This means they are the ones who have the most investment in you remaining as you were, and they will try everything to sabotage you. The irony is that they frequently don't even realize what they are doing. It's not logical, but it's common.

I'm glad you had that moment.\n\nI echo the replies, that your mum getting so upset over you saying no to having the meds is a red flag for her dependency. \n\nThere could be other issues though. Not everyone feels pleasure watching others succeed, sometimes it makes them feel bad about themselves. Maybe she does feel guilt as well. People do weird things when they experience big emotions.\n\nWhatever the reason, her behavior isn't because you have done anything wrong, you are not the asshole.

An addict can develop a tolerance to certain drugs like benzodiazepines or opioids.

Recovery is hard but it's worth it. And even when faced with issues from your own mom- dealing with her gaslighting, her guilt tripping, you were able to remain strong in your recovery. I hope nothing but amazingness comes to you. Find your village to lean on for support- I don't think mom will be a good villager right now- and continue to build on your future. Again, so so proud of the decisions you've made recently!  But I also hope you're proud of yourself bc that's what matters most. Make your amends and let them go. Don't let the past continue to drag you down. Be aware of it, acknowledge it but don't dwell in those feelings. The feelings can remain in the past. The actions of the past will help you learn for the actions of the future.", "I got that vibe too!", "No I hear you, I shouldn\u2019t have had them at all. Somehow I was able to stay strong enough to not use them and disposed of them the next morning. I drove to multiple police stations until I found one that had a disposal box and actually had to call the off hours line to have someone come out and unlock the door so I could dispose of them (Sunday hours, they were closed.)\n\nI know realistically I should have gotten rid of them the second my script was cut over a year ago. But, like you said, I\u2019m an addict. I fucked up.", "Well its pretty implied by her \"you owe me\" comment, but OP also confirmed in the comments that she wanted them for herself.", "OP\u2019s mom saying they \u201cowe\u201d her drugs is not trying to help get the drugs out of the house.

Its quite a coincidence that your drug of choice just happens to be the first one you ever took.\n\nUsing an addictive substance at a young age increases the chances of becoming an addict. It can physically change a growing brain. \n\nYour mother normalized taking pills to manage your anxiety at a very young age. Instead of any healthy coping strategies, she gave you pills. \n\nIt seems as if she may be an addict. The way she interacts with prescription drugs is off. Giving a child any prescription drug that wasn't prescribed for then is dangerous.
