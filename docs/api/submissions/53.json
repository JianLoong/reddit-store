Not to the point where I get body modifications to look like Darth Maul, but I have thought about it. JK. \n\nI just had people over to my house Saturday night for a birthday/Halloween party. The girl 28 I've been seeing on and off came over and helped me set up and prepare some snacks and stuff.  It was a pretty geeky evening of board games and video games.  That's what my friend group enjoys.  \n\nMy girlfriend tolerates it. I do stuff with her that she enjoys as well and do not force her to only do my nerd stuff. I took her golfing in Palm Springs for her birthday. \n\nSo most of my friends brought me bourbon as a gift. Or Lego.  But one girl I've known since college brought me a handmade Grogu doll. BABY YODA.  It is amazing and she knit it herself. I was super stoked.  \n\nAfter the party my girlfriend said I was an asshole for accepting a gift from someone who is obviously into me.  I told her my friend doesn't make a lot of money and always gives people handicrafts as gifts.  \n\nShe still wants me to give it back or something.  I don't really want to. It's really cool and well made. \n\nPutting this in because I know people will ask.  \nWe have been dating off and on for about a year. It is fun but not anything serious. She has made it clear that she doesn't consider me a grown up but she enjoys our time together and the way I treat her.", "created_utc": 1667281169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yizzx6/aita_for_accepting_a_cool_gift_from_a_woman/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was your birthday, right? Would a different gift be more acceptable?

You may give it back and gf be gone by next week anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t serious with this girl, right? You received a thoughtful gift from a friend who might be into you (maybe/maybe not?). Keep the gift. Your friend knows you, knows what you like and was nice enough to make a gift for you.

You are allowed to accept gifts from friends.", "NTA - It's a gift and your gf is just jealous and insecure.\n\nDo not under any circumstances give that gift back! I do crochet items and they take a long time to make, lots of hours of hard work go into them, if somebody were to give a handmade gift like that back to me I'd be very upset.\n\nYour friend knows you and knows the things you love and she made something that she knew you would love. That is a good friend! Don't allow your on and off girlfriend ruin that friendship because of her insecurities.\n\nAnd even if your friend did kind a have a thing for you, it doesn't matter. What matters is if you act upon it and whether you are leading that friend on knowing she likes you... You haven't mentioned any of that so I'm going to assume that it is simply just a friendship...
