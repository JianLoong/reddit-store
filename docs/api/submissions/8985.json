She is totally reserved, avoids talking to me, yet follows me around. We had a lab class together, and she would always sign up our names together to be lab partners without my permission, to the point that I had to tell my professor to stop letting her pair up with me.\n\nRecently, I have noticed her hovering around my dorm when I get back from classes, even though the girls' dorm is on a totally different floor. Whenever I try to confront her, she just walks away or will mutter \"sorry\" or something.\n\nI was at a smaller scale party the other day for the engineering department, and she floated in out of nowhere even though I'm pretty sure she's not an engineering major. She sat on a couch right next to me, and I moved away to a different one. She kept following me when I was switching couches and tried to start touching my arm and thigh, despite me telling her to stop (she would just mutter \"please\" and keep doing it.)\n\nShe followed me into a different room, and started touching me again, when I lost it and and yelled at her her to \"fuck off with her nasty shit\" and leave me the hell alone. She started bawling after this, and ran out of the room. The people around me started giving me weird looks because I yelled pretty loud. I feel kind of bad now because maybe my reaction was too strong, and I guess I could have just left the party. But I still think her behavior is totally disgusting. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice guys I will be talking to my RA and Dean.

Something is wrong with that girl.  You may need to report her to the school/dorm to let them know you have a stalker.  NTA", "NTA\n\nThat's so creepy. Is there anyone at your university you can talk to about being stalked and harassed?", "NTA.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. You\u2019re being stalked, harassed, and at this point she\u2019s touching you without your consent. Do *not* feel bad for yelling at her. Please *DO* report this to whoever you need to at your school - this behavior is completely inappropriate and likely goes against your school\u2019s code of conduct. You deserve to feel safe and comfortable on campus.", "No, NTA. She is stalking you, and there's no circumstance in which this is OK. You simply leaving the party would have done nothing to stop this disturbing behavior. Please be extremely careful now, as it's right after being rebuffed that stalkers can become really dangerous. Don't wait for your stalker to cross another line, and don't assume she's not dangerous, even if you don\u2019t hear from or see her for awhile. Notify campus police and the university. You're not overreacting. This woman needs help. Until she gets it, she's potentially dangerous.", "You've got a stalker there buddy and a right persistent one at that. NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is really creep behavior and you were totally right to yell at her when she kept touching you. I would definitely bring this up to student services and report her to the Dean of the science department you're in. I had a creepy stalker during my time at college and they took it extremely serious. They should have intervened by now.\n\nEdit: Oh the comments are predictably bad on this already. OP you don't owe someone who is harassing you politeness or \"gentleness\". She touched you, repeatedly. For all the \"maybe she's socially awkward\" people: I have some socially awkward people in my life, some of them teens and young kids. Absolutely none of us blame Op for this. It isn't acceptable.", "NTA.  That whole thing is weird and creepy.  Maybe it will stop the behavior.  If it doesn't, you may have to go a step further.  Recommend that you start documenting dates, places, witnesses, etc.", "NTA. Take this up with the Title 9 advisor at your school *YESTERDAY*. As someone who was also stalked in university, trust me when I say that you want to nip this in the bud before it gets *any* worse.", "nta, she was literally stalking you.", "NTA. Report her; she needs to understand that she\u2019s going over personal boundary lines.", "Unwanted touch is creepy and nasty. So NTA.", "NTA. her behavior *is* totally disgusting. you told her no multiple times. she repeatedly violated your boundary, you got angry. some people need to be yelled at sometimes. and reported too, but i see you\u2019ve already gotten advice on that. i hope that goes well!", "NTA. Politeness goes out the window when someone is touching you without your consent. Sorry you had to experience that.", "NTA. She's harassing you, stalking you, and touching you without your consent and after you've told her to stop.\n\nYou reached your breaking point and she was being nasty in touching you.", "NTA. She was absolutely harassing you", "NTA. she is stalking you. Tell the dean or whatever and if you can document EVERYTHING", "NTA! Omg, NTA at all! I\u2019m generally very sensitive towards socially-awkward people, as I\u2019ve struggled with social awkwardness all my life. But she has crossed that line and gone full-blown into Creeper territory. \n\nPlease report her to school faculty. At this point, it doesn\u2019t matter if it hurts her feelings. Based off the number of times she\u2019s dismissed your clear requests to be left alone, it sounds like she needs to learn the hard way to respect people\u2019s boundaries.", "Report it to your RA at the dorms. They will have the resources and connections to get it appropriately reported.", "I have to admit I was kind of \"wow, poor chick has a super awkward crush\" but the \"please\" bit made my skin crawl.\n\nNTA.

Whatever excuse she has doesn't mitigate that she's crossed serious social boundaries.", "Yo what the fuck \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\n\nNTA bro do NOT feel bad about this", "NTA tell your RA and keep escalating until someone listens. I didn\u2019t and I was stuck with my own stalker for years because I was worried about being polite. He was even able to get a job that gave him access to my room. I was lucky he didn\u2019t do anything with that access but I wish I said something sooner. \n\nAlso there\u2019s something really grime and hair raising about her saying \u201cplease\u201d. Be loud about telling her to stop following you. Don\u2019t be complacent or else it\u2019ll be harder to shake her.\n\nEdit: also I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you pm me if you need advice I worked in the university system and also have a similar experience", "NTA. Please be careful - I recommend reporting her and starting to document this in case this instance didn't stop her.", "She's old enough to know boundaries. You don't touch someone that obviously  does not want to be touched. Even if it's a girl doing the touching. Not okay.", "Absolutely NTA. That is stalking and really upsetting behavior. I\u2019d get the school involved.", "oh no, that\u2019s weird and creepy. NTA", "NTA. Just because you're a man doesn't mean you have to put up with being stalked and touched. It may not carry the same fear if you were a woman, but it's still creepy and very inappropriate. You told her stop many times very calmly. It had to escalate to yelling. She may have mental issues, I don't know, but that's not your responsibility.", "NTA but you should probably report this to your school\u2019s Title IX coordinator.", "NTA. You never need to be polite to someone who continuously disrespects your boundaries. I would report this if you can - simply in case she escalates you will have a paper trail establishing when this started", "Dude that's messed up, NTA. You only got weird glances cuz she was probably trying to get it on with you, which in this case she was gonna try to rape you per se, but because you yelled back because what she was doing was beyond wrong and disgusting, people might think you're in the wrong. Absolutely NTA and she needs serious help. She's a Stalker and sexually assaulted you", "NTA.\n\nSee if you can get some of the people at the party to write statements. Also your prof. Then report her to the school for s3xu@l harassment with the statements. Do this as soon as you can. Also file the same thing at the nearest police station (you can't really trust the school to take care of this).", "NTA, I don\u2019t care how shy you are, this is Not how you flirt. It doesn\u2019t even sound like she\u2019s tried to be friends with you! Following is creepy is hell but she really crossed the fucking line by repeatedly touching you despite you making it very clear you didn\u2019t want it. Hopefully reporting her and have something done about this and/or your reaction puts a stop to this behavior.", "NTA. She\u2019s stalking you, and she\u2019s escalated to harassing by touching you without your consent. Report this ASAP.", "NTA let's call it what it is - stalking and sexual harassment.", "NTA. No way dude, you don\u2019t have to let anyone touch you that you don\u2019t want. This whole thing is super creepy and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this. Talk to the school (maybe dean of students) about getting her far, far away from you. Even if something is going on from her end, that is absolutely not on you to deal with and you don\u2019t need to put up with this to spare her feelings", "NTA. If you were a girl and she was a boy, no one would say you were wrong in any way. And you're not. She's stalking you and sexually harassing you. It's past time to bring this to the attention of whatever authorities at your school are responsible for protecting the students. And make your parents aware of it too. You don't need to deal with it alone.", "She touched you\u2026she seems to not comprehend personal boundaries as an adult, NTA.", "NTA.  She sounds creepy af.", "NTA\n\nNuff said.", "Nta that is fuckin terrifying", "NTA, she\u2019s stalking you", "NTA, out of context your reaction would definitely seem harsh and out of place to people not involved. But with all this context I think your reaction was perfectly justified, she was walking all over your boundaries and making you feel unsafe. Maybe if you explain everything you wrote here calmly to the people bothering you about your reaction, they\u2019ll understand better.", "Nta she sounds scary and ghost like from your post. Hopefully she gets the memo this time but you should still report her if possible, who knows what's she's capable of also some advice I know you didn't call her your stalker but people in the chat ate but never call them \"MY\" stalker they should always be referred to the stalker if that makes sense", "NTA and if the roles were reversed the people at the party would not have reacted that way, which is of course hypocritical.", "NTA.\n\nShe was crossing boundaries..", "NTA. please be safe, stalkers are no joke.", "NTA my dude.", "NTA. If a guy did this to a girl then everyone would be like this fuckin weirdo! You did exactly what you should have, you called attention to her and this got her to stop, hopefully permanently. But I would report her behavior to your school in writing so it\u2019s documented. I\u2019m about preserving your safety and reputation- just in case she tries to say YOURE harassing her as retaliation.", "You need to get the police involved. She is stalking you.", "No means no- and it's sad that this is overlooked simply because you're a young man instead of a young woman. Shit would be a lot different if the situation were reversed. Be careful and watchful. Document everything.", "NTA\n\nI can understand why people might assume the crush thing, but her actions speak to something not that innocent. She\u2019s more or less stalking this poor guy, and that\u2019s not okay.\n\nI would keep an eye out for her OP. If this stuff continues, you might want to think about talking to campus security or at the very least the RA in your residence hall.", "We can analyze why she is behaving this way all we want, and statistically, some of us will get close. But the real thing to focus on is how to proceed. NTA, but it looks like there are a few ways this could go-one extreme being this is enough to get her to leave you alone and this will be a story you tell someday and the other extreme is that this becomes a real issue in your life that will require time and attention. The second is what you need to prepare for.\n\nDocument everything. Have a file where you list every interaction. Email your professor and state that you just want to confirm that he was aware she was pairing you two up and no longer want to allow that. The purpose for this is to get confirmation that she was the one pairing you two, and that you followed up to stop this.\n\nAfter you have gathered all of this information, email your Dean of Students. Explain (facts, not emotion) the situation, that you do not want to inadvertently make the situation worse, and would appreciate some guidance as well as advising him that you are willing to take the necessary steps to prevent any further interactions with this student, as long as they are reasonable and do not impede you in any way.\n\nIf things are as many suspect, there are already departments working with her, and this will start damage control behind the scenes. The most likely outcome is she\u2019s \u2018disappear\u2019 within about a month. But, if not, you have started the document trail that you have in fact taken reasonable steps to take care of yourself, and all of this will go a long way with authorities. \n\nIf, however, you hear nothing back and her behavior continues, it is time to start emailing people like Student Services, Disability Services, the Dean, etc, etc. obviously we hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. Another thing to seriously consider would be to send her an email (or other messaging system, depending on what you have access to through the school) clearly stating that you can respect her as another student, but you have no interest in any kind of relationship with her. You want to clearly request that this be the final interaction between you two, and any further interactions whatsoever with her will require you to get the school/authorities involved.  Do not apologize for what happened, do not try to justify yourself, do not be cruel, do not try to \u2018soften the blow\u2019 and do be clear and succinct. Do not let one of your friends convince you that you are being too harsh.", "NTA of course, that\u2019s so creepy. The harassment is obvious.", "NTA. As a woman, I'm imagining if anyone did this to me I'd be absolutely terrified and potentially fear for my safety (I may just be paranoid though) she followed you around, even to your doom room, and touched you without your consent. There's no need for you to be polite at that point.", "NTA\u2026you got sexually harassed. \u201cPlease\u201d that\u2019s so creepy. Get a restraining order", "NTA dude, do NOT feel guilty for planting your boundaries and such. She was crossing without consent and you told her in body language as well as words that she wasn\u2019t welcome around you.  She ignored it, that\u2019s on her. She made herself butt hurt. As someone said if this was switched the dude would be blasted.  Do not let tears (only because you held your ground and yelled AFTER giving her multiple warnings to stop) make you feel like you have to apologies. She is in the wrong not ypu", "NTA AT ALL!!! As someone who's been touched without consent, your reaction was completely okay. You told them no, and they didn't stop. You had to say no, loud enough to attract the attention of other people, for them to stop.", "NTA. you tried setting boundaries and she ignored them. Resentment escalated. Could have been said nicer I guess but I get it", "NTA, she\u2019s stalking you and touching you without consent. What if the roles were reversed?\n\nEdit to add: Fuck politeness! No means fucking no!", "NTA and you need to report this right now, not in a bit or tomorrow.

Facts will not play into your situation, so protect yourself immediately.", "NTA. She's stalking you. Make sure the school knows.", "NTA but I kinda feel like she has some serious social issues and has a crush on you", "NTA you warned her a few times you might look into a restraining order from the sounds of it.

Two, if she becomes vindictive she could claim you've been harassing her and paint you as the predator. \n\nIf you have any proof,  than take it with you for evidence.  If you can get ahold of all those labs she's signed you up for would also be great.

This is the sort of person to accuse you of all sorts of BS if they don't get their way. Don't be her victim.", "NTA. This is creepy. Being a woman doesn\u2019t give her a pass.

She is totally reserved, avoids talking to me, yet follows me around. We had a lab class together, and she would always sign up our names together to be lab partners without my permission, to the point that I had to tell my professor to stop letting her pair up with me.\n\nRecently, I have noticed her hovering around my dorm when I get back from classes, even though the girls' dorm is on a totally different floor. Whenever I try to confront her, she just walks away or will mutter \"sorry\" or something.\n\nI was at a smaller scale party the other day for the engineering department, and she floated in out of nowhere even though I'm pretty sure she's not an engineering major. She sat on a couch right next to me, and I moved away to a different one. She kept following me when I was switching couches and tried to start touching my arm and thigh, despite me telling her to stop (she would just mutter \"please\" and keep doing it.) \n\nShe followed me into a different room, and started touching me again, when I lost it and and yelled at her her to \"fuck off with her nasty shit\" and leave me the hell alone. She started bawling after this, and ran out of the room. The people around me started giving me weird looks because I yelled pretty loud. I feel kind of bad now because maybe my reaction was too strong, and I guess I could have just left the party. But I still think her behavior is totally disgusting.
