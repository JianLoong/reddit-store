That is our of line and totally unacceptable.  You did the right thing\n\n\nIt doesn't even matter your daughter has a good record at school. Even if your daughter was a little mischievous- still not acceptable. I'd insist your daughter not take cooking anymore.", "NTA \n\nAnd time to teach your daughter that no means NO and she is well within her rights to refuse, go to the headmaster and have them call you to sort it out. If she has to take a punishment for them wanting to be right for the sake of being in power, she can stand her ground and be proud of being morally right. Girls need to be taught compliance, when they are fearful is wrong, and they need to shout NO from the rooftops.", "NTA! \n\nThat was really innapropriate, here\u2019s hoping the school acts on it accordingly", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell is this woman thinking?", "NTA, protect your daughter.

If a teacher needs to search under a child's shirt, skirt, or trousers, then at a minimum, this should be done in a private space in the presence of two teachers of the same sex as the child.\n\nI would be expecting the school to not use the services of that particular substitute teacher ever again.", "NTA.  Now is the time to have a teaching moment with your daughter.  Sit her down and explain what the teacher requested is way out of line, and that if anyone says that to her again, she is to ignore them, and if it is a teacher, to get up, and go straight to the principle and report sexual harassment by a teacher, and to use her phone to call the police on the way, and report the teacher attempted to sexually abuse her in class.   \n    \nTeach her that she has value, and you will be behind her 100% in fighting anything like this again.   \n    \nAnd now that you have reported it to the school, it is your responsibility to file a police report on the teacher.", "Definitely make a complaint to the school, that is super inappropriate.

I feel like the teacher being a girl doesn\u2019t make a difference. It\u2019s still incredibly weird especially after she showed her the phone.", "NTA, funny enough my high school principal asked me to do the same thing once. Granted, it WAS at graduation and they were checking everyone\u2019s robes to make sure they were dressed appropriately.  My last name is towards the end of the alphabet so by the time he got to me he said \u201clift your skirt\u201d instead of robe and then it was like he shriveled up inside and was like \u201cno! Nope! That\u2019s not what I meant\u201d but I understood. Funny moment right before the ceremony. His kid was our salutatorian so he had other things going on as well besides doing the whole graduation ceremony.", "NTA", "NTA. I'd be just a furious about a female teacher doing this shit to my daughter (if I had one) as I would at a male teacher doing it; absolutely ***nobody*** at a school has ***any*** right to demand female students expose themselves like that for ***any*** reason, least of all in front of the entire class.", "NTA. And quite frankly if this is true I'd be reporting the teacher to the police.", "REPORT REPORT REPORT\n\nHold your ground and don't stop until you know the teacher is reprimanded.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nThe teachers gender, nor your daughters record of behaviour matter at all. This is sexual harassment of a minor. Full Stop. Go all in and get the teacher sacked and blacklisted if possible.", "that's sexual harassment regardless of the teacher's gender", "NTA. At all. This teacher was way out of line and if it were my daughter, I\u2019d be down there to personally tear her a new asshole for what she did. I hope she sees consequences for this and that your daughter is doing okay.", "NTA...holy shit i wouldn't stop calling, mailing or whatever to the school until said teacher was fired!", "NTA even remotely. I would pursue this with a vengeance. I would bet you $100 the school did not report anything and won\u2019t give a crap unless you escalate.", "NTA and I would make a HUGE deal out of this. Notify school, school board and police. So very wrong!!!", "#NTA NTA NTA\n\nTeacher is lucky that all you have done is make phone calls. If they are only fired they are lucky.", "Nta. I'd be calling the schoolboard. Take it all the way to the top. That's sexual harassment. If this was a male teacher the school would take it more seriously.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTo tell a child (no matter their age) to expose themselves like lifting a skirt is outrageous. \n\nI suggest that you contact the school board to \u201cfollow up about this issue\u201d because the school said they reported this issue. \n\nDemand that your child is not be removed from any class involving that teacher since they have forced a child to do such a thing, you do not believe that your child is safe with this teacher, and that your child does not feel safe and comfortable around this teacher. \n\nAlso, mention this issue with other parents that you know have kids that go to school with your kid. They have a right to know that a teacher is forcing children to expose themselves to them and to the class. It might cause a big enough issue if more parents request that their children have no contact with that teacher or that teacher needs to be fired which will force the school board to investigate the school for allowing and hiding such incidents thus may result in firing the teacher and other enabling/complicit school staff.\n\nEdit: saw that supply mean a substitute teacher but everything applies even for substitute/supply teachers. Inform the school that your child will not be in the same classroom or any room with that sub/supply teacher and that they need to ensure that sub/supply teacher does not sub for her classes or that if the sub/supply teacher sub her class then she has study hall that period, free period, or goes to another class that period.", "NTA. This is highly unprofessional and acceptable, possibly even illegal. Do not let this go by without getting some kind of satisfaction.", "I don\u2019t honestly understand OPs post. Huh? What is a supply? What do you mean your daughters skirt was tucked up???", "What does \u201cthey had a supply\u201d mean? I don\u2019t understand how all hell broke loose because I don\u2019t know what a supply is.", "That was completely inappropriate and unacceptable of that teacher to do. You did the right thing by telling the school about this incident. \n\nNTA", "The teacher could\u2019ve asked her to step outside for a minute. Then she\u2019d be able to tell if she\u2019s playing the music or not as the sound would \u201ctravel\u201d with her if she moves.\n\nI find it crazy that a teacher would really say \u201cpull your skirt up\u201d to their student.\n\n???? What the hell is going on here? IMO OP is being pretty rational about this bc ik people who would go batshit crazy over this. That is an inappropriate request from an adult or teacher to a child/their student.\n\nAgain, teacher could\u2019ve asked her to step outside or sent her to the principal\u2019s office.", "No one should ever say that to anyone.", "Yeah. If this class is being taught by another teacher I\u2019d move ASAP, if not I\u2019d ask her to change class entirely. I would not want that teacher near my kid at all if that happened", "I think it's also important to teach kids not to accept punishment for things they didn't do. As an adult, will you go to jail for something you didn't do? How much your pride of being morally right will support you there? I guess you'll find the lawyer instead, so what use will be teaching kids something they won't ever use in adult life? Girls especially need to be taught not to be responsible for other people faults, it happens at work much more than we know.", "The parents need to go in in person too. Following up a complaint by being there in person puts pressure on the school to actually do something, rather than attempt to brush it under the carpet.", "im so sorry i didnt make it clearer! yes i did mean substitute :)", "In the UK we call them supply teachers.", "Her skirt was tucked up when she was sitting down (she doesnt roll it up)", "I just can't get over the fact that even after showing the phone, the teacher still said that. I think that's what makes it truly feel like this goes beyond just wanting to see if she was playing music and into a whole other gross and highly inappropriate realm.", "If somebody said that to my kid, I\u2019d be raising holy hell. Who the hell does the teacher think they were to tell an underage child to lift up the skirt in front of other students or at any time at all? I\u2019d be at school first thing early in the morning to talk with the principal about that because that shit does not fly.", "I can\u2019t say that to my wife?", "I *think* they had a sub -- I think the word \"supply\" was meant to be sub, but was autocorreceted.\n\nNonetheless, this is inappropriate and absolutely deserves reporting.", "Learning new things!  Thanks", "But why though?", "Still do not understand. If you have a skirt, and you\u2019re sitting, you usually tuck the skirt under your butt, on the chair.", "In the bedroom, sure. But not to a kid.", "If it\u2019s in the UK, we use the term Supply Teacher, not Sub, so it wouldn\u2019t be an autocorrect.", "Was wondering what the heck supply meant in this context, thanks for the explanation\n\nNot the first story I've heard about a sub being overly harsh, maybe because they're afraid of losing control by kids trying to get one over on the new gal.\n\nYet those stories generally involve medical exemptions to classroom rules which the sub hadn't been informed of. In that case I'd kinda understand calling BS if she hadn't seen the paperwork (though my retired teacher mom said she'd give a student a benefit of the doubt in the moment) but this case was obviously something like sexual harassment.", "In the UK we call them supply teachers.", "Theyre just being a wiseass cause you said *anyone* lol", "Ooooh TIL!", "Canada too.", "Sorry. I don't pick up sarcasm on Reddit. It's easier when I'm looking at the person, lol."]}
