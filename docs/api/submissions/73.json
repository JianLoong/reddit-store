{"id": 73, "submission_id": "yio7xx", "title": "WIBTA for staying home on Thanksgiving?", "selftext": "I (38F) and single with no kids. My younger brother and SIL live about a 2-hour flight (10 hour drive) from me in another state. My mom lives about an hour\u2019s drive away from me. My brother has a 3 yo son and my SIL is 6 months pregnant. In the past, my mom has hosted Thanksgiving dinner for extended family, but since my nephew was born, my brother hasn\u2019t wanted to travel. He wants to host Thanksgiving at their home and invited me and my mom. However, my brother texted to say that there\u2019s not enough room at their home for me to stay there. They have 3 bedrooms and a basement that is being renovated into guest suite, but it\u2019s not completed yet. My mom will stay in the guest room, which has a bed that only sleeps one person. I asked if I could stay on their couch, but my SIL has a rule that no one can sleep on the couch because it\u2019s an expensive couch. I asked if I could sleep on the futon in my nephew\u2019s room, but their said no because it would be disruptive to his sleep and nap schedule and comfort. I asked if I could sleep in their living room on the floor or a foldout bed and they said no because it would be messy/ disruptive to the shared living space and my nephew\u2019s play area. There is not enough room to put a fold out bed in the guest room where my mom will sleep because it\u2019s a small room. \n\nI\u2019m worried about finances in general and the holidays are always a bit stressful for me, money-wise. I have a well-paying job and I freelance on the side, but I have a lot of expenses and I live in a high cost of living city. To visit my brother and his family for Thanksgiving, I would need to purchase a flight ($400-500), 2 nights in a hotel ($400-500 ish total), and miscellaneous things like Ubers since they live in a residential area that is not close to where the hotels are. \n\nWhen I expressed my concern, my brother offered the use of some hotel points he has and said that \u201cmom won\u2019t come without you, so just hurry up and get this arranged.\u201d I confirmed with my mom that\u2019s she\u2019s booked her flight and will visit regardless of my plans. I really don\u2019t feel welcome and I feel like my brother and SIL just saw me as a necessary inconvenience to get my mom to attend. My only motivation for going would be to see my nephew. Financial stress and generally feeling unwelcome are cons for going.\n\nWould I be the asshole for staying home? I\u2019m concerned that I\u2019m being overly sensitive.", "created_utc": 1667248675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yio7xx/wibta_for_staying_home_on_thanksgiving/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like they don\u2019t want you there. Empty rooms, couch, they even said no to the *floor*? Don\u2019t go through the trouble if they can\u2019t even accommodate your sleeping situation after a 10hr drive/or flight. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through that.", "NTA.  I give you permission to decline.  From a random Reddit friend.", "NTA. This doesn't sound like it would be a very enjoyable experience. If you're staying home to punish your brother/SIL, you'd likely regret that choice. But if you're staying because it would be expensive, and you'd prefer to do something enjoyable, choose yourself and stay home.", "NTA - If you are tight on finances don't pay to go to a gathering with people who don't really want you there in the first place. Stay home and enjoy your money and your peace. Even if they did want you there and you want to save money and stay home then do so. Catch them next time.", "NTA stay home make your own plans. Even if it is just to watch crappy Hallmark movies and eating whatever you want in your underwear.\n\nIt does seem fairly obvious that your brother only wants your mom there and your presence is something they will tolerate. So make plans for yourself that weekend. Treat yourself, or get together with friends. \n\nLet your brother know that you appreciate the invite, but you just can't swing it this year. And then have your own fun.", "NTA. That sounds like an uncomfortable, stressful, and expensive Thanksgiving to me. Stay home, relax, and save yourself the cash and the hassle. \n\nThat said, does SIL think she's fooling anyone with her \"no sleeping on the couch because it's expensive\" nonsense? She has a kid and has another on the way - that thing is going to be put through the wringer a whole lot more than it could ever be put through even if you slept in it every night for a year. Sounds more like she doesn't want you there.", "NTA. At all. It\u2019s a host\u2019s job to make a guest feel wanted so your brother is already doing a poor job of hosting. Frankly he should have led with purchasing your hotel rm for you using points and perhaps you would have felt better about the whole thing without all that \u201cwhat about\u2026\u201d nonsense that just made things so much worse. Just be mindful of not cutting off your nose to spite your face - make plans with friends for Thanksgiving or invite some others in similar situations over, so you don\u2019t regret your decision later.", "NTA at all\n\nYour brother and SIL seem annoying. Why spend so much money in a place that you don\u2019t even feel comfortable at, I completely understand how you would feel unwelcome.", "NTA. They are really unwilling to accommodate you in any way.", "NTA - I don't think that you are being overly sensitive here. You asked for multiple places to be able to stay at your brothers and were shot done every time.  I mean come on they wouldn't even let you have the floor because it would be messy / disruptive! They sound like complete AHs. Do yourself a favor and just stay home. And please if they ever ask you for anything be PETTY and do not accommodate them at all. And if they ask anything else about coming to visit say it's too disruptive to your life.", "NTA - how much more of an unvitation do you need? Don\u2019t go as they are going out of their way to show how unwelcome your presence is this Thanksgiving!", "Sleep comfortably in your own bed...you're not being made to feel welcome.", "NTA you are right, they want your mom there not you. F. That. Honestly, afterwards, explain to mom. If her house holds everyone that\u2019s where these things should be.", "100% NTA. Your brother needs to understand your life doesn\u2019t revolve around his.", "NTA they are asking a lot and not being very accommodating. You do not have to go if you are not comfortable going.", "You are right not feel welcome at their home for Thanksgiving. They have nixed every reasonable option for you.  Just tell them \u201cthank you for the invitation however finances are tight now and you can\u2019t afford it\u201d. Wish them and your mom a happy holiday. Stay home and enjoy some quiet time.", "NTA, but do you really want to go?", "NTA if you can\u2019t afford it you can\u2019t afford it.", "NTA- it\u2019s clear you are unwelcome in their home and your presence is unwanted, you said it yourself you were only invited because they thought your mom wouldn\u2019t come without you.", "NTA I would stay at home too :P", "NTA and I would be honest about not feeling welcome. I've been doing my own Thanksgivings alone for the last 5 years and the peace of mind (and ear) is great. I go for a long walk in the morning and later have my own fancy meal while watching Charlie Brown and Garfield Thanksgiving specials.", "NTA. Sounds like they really don't want you staying with them but they want you to be your mother's 'carer' for the holiday trip? Sod that. I find it really difficult to believe that they couldn't work out an air mattress and a corner of the house somewhere. \n\nYour mother's travel plans are sorted. You can see your nephew another time. You find something awesome to do for the weekend and wish them well. Your brother needs a short sharp lesson in hospitality.", "NTA. This is not a big deal and it might help if you don\u2019t treat it as one (assuming these are reasonable people.) Thank them for the offer, let your bro know mom confirmed she is coming, but money\u2019s tight and you look forward to seeing them all next time.", "NTA. I started several years ago staying home for Thanksgiving and usually my friends and I cook and eat together at some point. It sounds like a hassle. If you don\u2019t want to spend that money, don\u2019t. Seems like you could sleep on their floor. If not, I would not feel welcome. She is 6 months pregnant and she will do the cooking?", "NTA - If they decided to move across the country then that\u2019s on them and they can\u2019t expect you to come to them every year.", "NTA. They are not very welcoming. Stay home. Is there a Friendsgiving you can go to?", "NTA they can't accommodate you . And those hotel points are absolutely worthless during the holidays. \nSave your money and relax. Enjoy your holiday", "NTA..and now you can eat what every you want!!!", "NTA\n\nLook, I'm not going to rush to judgment that your brother doesn't want you there.  It is normal for people to have kids, quickly realize that hauling them around the country for holidays is not gonna work, and start hosting holidays at home.  That doesn't mean they don't want their family around.  Just that wanting your family around doesn't necessarily mean they *want* everyone sleeping in their living room to achieve it.\n\nHolidays are endless pros and cons.  They get to celebrate at home, but they want to be surrounded by family, but they have to do all the work to host, etc etc.  And for you, you want to celebrate with family, but it is expensive always being the one who travels.\n\nI think it is fine for you not to go this year.  Hopefully the guest suite will be available for you next year.  Just let your brother know that you checked with mom, she is definitely going, so it's gotten too pricey for you, and you can't make it this year.  Much love, happy holidays, etc.", "They\u2019ve made you extremely unwelcome and are unwilling to compromise in any way.  You\u2019ll be happier at home tbh.  NTA.", "NTA. You have this random Redditor's permission to decline the invitation.", "NTA I'm 40 and single and have enjoyed solo Thanksgivings for years. It's pretty amazing to eat and do whatever you want", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t even need to read this to say that no one has to go visit family for Thanksgiving. You are home, as your title indicates.", "NTA.  You don't feel welcome, you don't seem to especially want to go, so stay home.  Your mother is an adult and can make her own choices. \n\n\\*OR\\* brother could pay for your hotel room and transportation while you are in town.  It is okay to not jump through hoops to perform family \"traditions.\"\n\nI like the earlier comment of \"Let your brother know that you appreciate the invite, but you just can't swing it this year. And then have your own fun.\"\n\nDo what you want and don't worry too much about anything except what YOU are comfortable with.", "NTA.
