Two weeks ago, I decided to tell my dad that I didn\u2019t want to continue going to her house, he said he understood and told me he would talk to her. When i went to my moms house, she confronted me about it and started crying saying i must hate her and saying that She didn\u2019t deserve what i was doing to her. I tried my best to explain to her that I did love her but she wouldn\u2019t listen. On Sunday, when she was supposed to take me to my dads, she asked if i wanted to stay another night. I told her i wanted to go back and she started telling me another story about why my father is a horrible man and why i shouldn\u2019t stay with him(sometimes he drinks and when he does he drinks a lot but makes sure to stay in his room so he doesn\u2019t bother us). That was when i reached my breaking point, i was tired of her guilt tripping me into staying, and lying about my dad, I told her that she was the reason why i didn\u2019t want to go to her house and that it\u2019s her own fault. She started crying and went into her room and hasn\u2019t talked to me since(my stepdad drove me home).

And what your mother is trying to do by telling you how horrible your father is, and sending your extended family to guilt/shame you for calling her out, is called Parental Alienation. The courts take a very negative view of one parent and their family trying to drive a wedge between the other parent and child - many consider it a form of child abuse.", "NTA fuck 4yrs of guilt tripping every weekend is just too much, and then to drag your dad through the mud like that to try and turn you against him is just gross and manipulative\u2026..I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go there if she\u2019s just making you feel shit being there\n\nBUT I also hope that your dad seeks out help for his drinking because that\u2019s not healthy for him or safe for you, you know?", "No one\u2019s the A-hole. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. With that being said I think a healthy dose of family therapy and individual therapy for your mom would probably help. With what you said  i feel that she loves you very much but is terrible at communicating how she feels. She also needs to respect your space and wishes as well. The true a-holes are the \u201cfamily members\u201d who need to mind their own business. \n\nFor reference the therapy is more for your mom than you. \n\nI hope everything works out in your situation!", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be around that guilt trip either. I mean, if she ever really wants to know why you don't want to stay there, just reminder of this episode.", "Oh, NTA honey. I'm sorry your mom lacks the tact and maturity to handle this in a healthy way. You're old enough that you should be able to decide who you want to stay with, and her trying to guilt and manipulate you because she doesn't like your choice is just wrong. And shame on any family messaging you with their opinions when they have nothing to do with it and only have your mom's version of events. It sounds like a break from your mom is probably a good thing right now. Maybe this is something to navigate in a family therapy setting.", "I had a mother that would guilt me like this. She probably loves you a lot, but there are probably other issues that she is dealing with, could be mental health.  \n\n\nThat fact she is using her family against you is a very bad sign. The best thing I ever did was going No contact with my mother.\n\nYou should definetly set boundries with your mother going forward and stick firm to what you want out of this relationship.", "NTA she's manipulating you for her benefit not yours.\n\nWhen you talk with unsupportive family members be sure to stress that you wish you could spend time with your mom but that she is preventing you from being able to do so.", "NTA.\n\nGetting a bunch of messages attacking you is actually a sure sign that you are in the right.  You get bad feedback from the witch's flying monkeys, not from Glinda the Good.", "INFO: What was the reason of their divorce? Does your mom have any reason to fear for your safety? (i.e. maybe he was abusive towards her and she fears he might do the same to you?)\n\nJust trying to see if there might be a reasonable explanation behind her \u201cguilt tripping\u201d. But anyway NTA, and I hope your mom find a way to better communicate with you :)", "NTA, and no one should be calling you names.  You are a child in an obviously dysfunctional family.  None of this is your fault or responsibility.", "The only AH here is your mom and her family.", "NTA. How did your mom end up with a 16 year old kid when she appears to only be 16 herself?", "NTA and good for you for standing up to your mother.", "NTA. Look up Parent Alienation Syndrome. Your mom is purposely trying to turn you against your dad and make you pick sides. It\u2019s incredibly toxic. Ask your dad to get you into therapy. You may need to stop contact with your mom for a while.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts to hear", "ESH. Your mom needs a better way to communicate, but why are you calling her a liar when she said your dad has a drinking problem and you confirmed that he does? Regardless of the drinking can you at least consider that your mother loves you and misses you? 2 days a week is not much time with someone you love- no wonder she\u2019s sad about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
