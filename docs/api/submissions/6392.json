Ever since we met I\u2019ve gone with her to a holiday party hosted by her and her best friend. It\u2019s a fairly large party, that grows every year. This year I did not attend, my wife is still pretty upset with why I didn\u2019t. \n\nTwo days before the party I was notified my ex fianc\u00e9e had passed. I didn\u2019t know the details, but it hit me very hard. To be honest, towards the end of things we didn\u2019t have the best relationship and I\u2019ll spare those details. She was an addict and had relapsed which heavily influenced the ending of our relationship. I went through a lot of grief leaving her in that state, maybe it hit me because I feel like I didn\u2019t do enough to help her. \n\nIn any case, I was pretty down and did not feel like socializing. I told my wife I was going to skip the party. When I was first notified I told my wife to which she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you ok?\u201c I thought she would understand my reasoning, but she did not. She was quite offended I was bothered enough about my ex that I wouldn\u2019t feel up to her party. \n\nAfter the party she came home and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re this upset about some junkie.\u201d I was honestly taken back by her cold, callous attitude. My ex was a daughter, a mother, a sister. She was somebody that was messed up from life. I spent the next several days and into Christmas putting on a fake happy face and tried not thinking about my ex. \n\nOver the weekend I had more calls about the details involving her death, which further upset me. My wife noticing something was off with me asked if I still loved her (my ex), and is that why I\u2019m \u2018devastated.\u2019 She said it\u2019s weird how I\u2019m mourning the loss of my ex when I haven\u2019t had anything to do with her in years. I explained to my wife she (my ex) was my first love and I did love her as a person. \n\nLast night I told my wife I will be attending my ex\u2019s funeral and I\u2019d like for her to come if she wanted. She became angered by that, saying she doesn\u2019t want to go near a junkie\u2019s funeral because the place will be full of addicts. Which might be partially true but I think I should be allowed to pay my last respects regardless. She told me if I end up going, \u2018we\u2019re going to have problems.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she meant by that, but she threw in my face how this \u2018ruined\u2019 our holiday and again stated she can\u2019t believe I missed her party because of my ex. She told me I need to seek professional help because it\u2019s not normal for a married man to be upset about his ex dying. \n\nI began thinking maybe she\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m mourning her loss. I began asking myself if I still had feelings for my ex, but in my head I knew things were done. I wouldn\u2019t have married my wife if I felt things weren\u2019t finished with a previous relationship. I\u2019ve practically stopped myself from grieving because I guess it shouldn\u2019t have mattered to me. I asked my wife if she\u2019d be upset if her ex died, she said that\u2019s different because she shares a child with him.", "created_utc": 1672765368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102d890/aita_for_missing_my_wifes_annual_christmas_party/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was feeling down and didn\u2019t want to attend. I thought she (my wife) would understand, but she became offended with how emotional I was over my ex. She\u2019s developed an attitude toward the situation, ever since I missed the party. I cannot mention my ex around her, or else she becomes angered. I think I might be the AH because I should have just pushed my ex\u2019s passing aside and went to the party.

You\u2019re allowed to mourn the passing of a person who has significance in your life even after you\u2019ve removed them. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Sorry, but your wife is cold and callous. This is a very mean-spirited response to the death of someone you once loved and cared about. I dated a guy in freaking middle school (7th-8th) and he died tragically at 25. I was crushed! And guess what, my husband supported me through it because I still cared for him. The fact that she was your ex-fiance who you had love for makes your wife even more of an AH. I don't care that she was stuck in addiction. She was still a human who deserves to be mourned by those who loved her and remember her, despite her flaws. Way to be jealous of a dead person, sheesh", "NTA 100%. Just because an ex dies, you shouldn't care?? That's cold and heartless of her and honestly, I would be a bit concerned with her lack of empathy for you. Saying that it is different if her ex died because they had a kid is a cop out and she knows it. A first love is special, even after a breakup with them. Don't let her get you down, stick to your feelings and don't let her control how you should be feeling.", "Holy hell. NTA. Your wife is showing a truly disturbing lack of empathy.", "NTA. Your wife is rude and has little empathy towards addiction, which is a disease. It\u2019s people like her that make it hard for recovering addicts to get places. I would absolutely mourn the loss of a loved one. Just because you weren\u2019t still in love with her doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t have love in your heart for her as a person. Sorry you have a wife who can\u2019t have empathy.", "First, NTA.\n\nSecond it sounds like your wife is jealous of your ex-partner(s). This is something I understand, because I struggle with my own jealous tendencies, but your wife is not being reasonable. In fact, she's being quite cruel and hateful.\n\nMy mom was a junkie. She was very flawed. She was also a sweet, loving, fun, compassionate woman who had been destroyed by life and was just... coping. I'd be fucking LIVID if anyone talked about her the way your wife talked about your former fiance.", "Ican understand you feeling upset you loved this person at one time but I also see your wife\u2019s side. You have basically shut her out and are moping around the house acting like this person has been in your life for the last few years.  You can certainly be sad and want to go to her funeral but you have also shut your wife out, ignored your Christmas/New Years plans because someone from your past has died. You are acting like you were close to this person now.  If i was your wife I would be concerned about the way you are acting too.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife lacks basic human empathy. Her annual party is not more important than a funeral. What a shallow and tacky response.\n\nShe needs to stop being so cruel about your ex and judging people who have the DECENCY to pay their respects. \n\nThe double standard with her ex is ridiculous. Grief doesn\u2019t depend on mixing your DNA! As your PARTNER, she should care about supporting you. Sorry that you\u2019re married to such a heartless person.", "NTA someone who was a big part of your life was suddenly taken and as an empathetic human being, that shook you. Your feelings are entirely natural.", "NTA. I guess empathy is an unknown concept for your wife. Your ex was a part of your life, a significant part of your past. You mourning her death is normal. Your wife not understanding it is not normal.", "It is totally normal. I don't know what is up with your wife, but it is not a good look. NTA. Get some support. Help. Grieve.  Get some reasonable distance from your wife because you need it.", "what is wrong with your wife? NTA. your wife is a heartless AH, who lacks empathy.", "I'm dead inside, and even I can see that your wife's lack of empathy is concerning.  NTA, but you should get some professional help to find out why you are with a woman like this.", "NTA. Your wife feels threatened and insecure, which can happen. But her attitude towards someone who has just died and you for grieving her loss, it's too much. Honestly, she sounds like a bad person.", "NTA. Your wife sounds very cold about this subject and she's a hypocrite! What does it matter if her and her ex have a kid? Basically she'd be allowed to grieve him if he died and yet you can't grieve your ex. That's a double standard! She should be willing to go with you to the funeral and support you while you're going through this.", "I think your wife needs help for see what her selfishness and lack of empathy is about\n\nNTA", "NTA. But someone such as your wife who lacks very basic compassion, understanding, and sympathy worries me. I\u2019m sorry your ex passing took the shine off her little party but seriously\u2026?

She\u2019s jealous and that\u2019s a her problem\u2026and maybe think about a few things because wow.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that you are mourning your ex (though you are and that\u2019s okay, she was a significant part of your life) you are mourning the \u201ccould\u2019ve beens\u201d.  What she could have accomplished had her illness not taken her over, what she could have made of herself, the things she could have done- that\u2019s a loss. Even those that love her deeply may feel they lost her long ago to her addictions, but they will still mourn the loss of what could\u2019ve been.", "NAH but I wouldn\u2019t go or you\u2019re going to be mourning your relationship pretty soon after. The past needs to be left in the past.", "NAH. I get why your wife is mad. This looks bad. Like you're still in love with ex and only settled for your wife. But you're entitled to your feelings, whatever they are.", "NAH\n\nI know many are saying your ex is being cruel and callous, and I do see that she is having a double standard saying it would be different if her ex died because they have a child together.\n\nBut try to see it this way: your WIFE has been BLINDSIDED by something that was not even remotely on her radar, during the most stressful time of year (the holidays may have a reputation as being jolly and fun, but it\u2019s actually a stressful and depressing time; it\u2019s no coincidence that suicides are more common at this time of year. The holidays are a trigger and bummer for many people). \n\nYour wife may not be handling this situation well, but I don\u2019t think you are either. You have been blindsided as well, and I think that\u2019s because you didn\u2019t finish grieving the relationship with your ex while she was alive. Unless someone is still friends with an ex, has a child and is co-parenting with an ex, business partners with an ex, or any other situation where the ex is still a regular part of their daily life, I think it shows a level of emotional entanglement to grieve like you are, 7 years after the relationship has ended. I don\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t deserve to grieve at all. But there is a difference between quietly grieving and feeling the pain and the temporary nature of life and love, the mortality of our existence - and being so torn up you\u2019re putting on a fake face and can\u2019t go to a holiday party hosted by your own wife. There are levels of grieving, and the level that you grieved for your ex\u2019s death was too intense for your wife not to be upset by, and too intense for the situation. You should have closed this chapter years ago. The grief should have been different, a less severe grief. \n\nI would be upset if I were your wife, too. People are saying she lacks empathy, but I think you also lacked empathy for her, if you couldn\u2019t understand why something from out of the blue like this that hit you so hard, would also affect your wife.\n\nHowever, I do not think this makes you an asshole! We are all human and being a human is complicated! But I do not think your wife is an asshole either. I think you two should go to counseling and talk this through with a mediator who can help both of you see the other\u2019s perspective in a fair and balanced way. I think it is fair for you to want to go to the funeral, but I also think it\u2019s fair for your wife to be upset by that, and for her to not want to go. \n\nEveryone being so harsh towards your wife are coming from a place of kindness towards you, but I think it\u2019s possible if your wife wrote up her own version of this (including details about her own stress surrounding the holidays, the shock of your grief, being blindsided by all this, etc) it\u2019s very possible people could see from your wife\u2019s POV and understand she is not an evil or callous person. She is human, just like you, and neither of you are perfect, it\u2019s the nature of being human.", "INFO: kinda seems like ages and times matter here no? You\u2019ve been married for 3 years, but how long has it been since you broke up with your ex? \n\nIf things ended so poorly, why are you still receiving so many \u201ccalls\u201d about her death? It\u2019s tragic yes, but I guess I\u2019m just confused as to how you\u2019re getting all these \u201cupdates\u201d if you weren\u2019t involved in her life at all?\n\nETA: going for NAH. With the context you provided, it\u2019s pretty clear your wife is concerned about revisiting this chapter of your life. Your ex was manipulative and emotionally abusive, it\u2019s probably hard for your wife to come to terms with the fact that this has been affecting your for weeks, and now you\u2019re going to the funeral. \n\nIt defo comes off like you\u2019re not over her, especially from the line you used \u201cI invested a lot into her and I think it\u2019s only fair I was informed\u201d. If that\u2019s true, why didn\u2019t your ex\u2019s family reach out to you first? Why the \u201cfriend of my ex\u2019s family who\u2019s mom is friends with my mom\u201d?

I lost someone who was a fundamental part of making me who I am. I went to his funeral. It wasn\u2019t because I was still in love with him or because he was a threat to my current relationship at the time. It was because I loved him as a person. As someone who knew the depths of me. As someone I\u2019d wanted to succeed and be happy.. and now he won\u2019t get to. He won\u2019t be get to see his sons grow up. He won\u2019t get to find a wife. Nothing. I understand how you likely feel OP. I\u2019m sorry that your wife is acting like this.. she needs to understand that there\u2019s no reason to be jealous of the dead and letting you mourn is the healthy thing to do. (Assuming you don\u2019t become obsessed with your ex or something) \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your wife is heartless, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be upset to find out someone you once loved has died, my grandad died a month ago and my grandmother was upset even though they haven\u2019t been together for 23 years and their relationship prior wasn\u2019t that great, there\u2019s no feelings on either side but losing someone who was once in your life, will most likely have some effect over you, your wife seems petty and insecure and seems to be battling a competition with your dead ex. You are allowed to grieve your loss.", "Wow. NTA. However-your wife sounds extremely insensitive at best and a total asshole at worst. I\u2019m a recovering addict and I know how incredibly hard it is to get out of that. It almost always stems from trauma and trying to escape the feelings associated with that. Maybe she\u2019s ignorant, as many people are, but it\u2019s still so nasty of her to speak of someone like that. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand it. That was someone\u2019s mother, daughter, and sister that died, as you said. What awful things to say about that person. I\u2019m surprised that doesn\u2019t bother you more as it shows what kind of person she is. \n\nI have lost many people in my past to addiction, including an ex. My husband was very understanding of my need to grieve, go to the funerals, and understood when I struggle on the annual date my ex died-even 12 years later. He has never spoken negatively about anyone. He was able to put any selfishness or jealousy aside for what I needed in the moment. Anything less than that is not fair to you. \n\n*You are allowed to mourn and grieve however you feel you need to.* If she doesn\u2019t give you time to do that, then maybe you should be the one to tell her that you will have problems. I\u2019m so sorry that your ex didn\u2019t make it out of addiction. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. Your wife's reaction is incredibly callous and unsupportive and a massive red flag. You don't need anyone's permission to grieve or feel the loss of your ex's passing. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA - men get out of there. Your wife doesn't even respect and understand your sadness... Threaten you is also a big red flag \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI'ts common sense that you get sad from someone you knew.", "NTA.

Someone who was once close to you passing is sad and you should be allowed to grieve, no matter what relationship you had. Your wife is TA and jealous of a dead person.", "I agree with your wife\u2019s sentiment that you need to speak to a professional but I think the professional in question needs to be a divorce lawyer because holy crap your wife is the AH here and by aLOT", "NTA your wife sounds cruel.", "NTA. Just because she was your ex doesn't mean you're not allowed to have any feelings at all regarding her. You're allowed to CARE when someone who had been in your life passes. Your wife is absolutely in the wrong about the whole situation.", "NTA.. your wife is jealous among other things.\n\nYour ex was still part of your life and that is all there is to it\u2026 pls go to the funeral..\n\nIf your wife is so threatened by your compassion for another human being so be it.. you dont need someone in your life who is that insecure.", "Whoa.  NTA. Your wife, though...   \n\n\nI'm sorry that you are with someone who doesn't understand addiction, that people with addictions are so much more than their addictions, and that the end of a relationship does not indicate an utter lack of care or indifference toward a person.  Your emotional response indicates a genuine concern for a person, even if that person is a distant memory and has no influence over your daily life.  It indicates that you truly care for the people you involve yourself with - the whole person, not just what kind of transactional benefits you get from the person.   \n\n\nThere is a *right* floating around in certain psychology circles: The right to grieve. What you are experiencing is known as disenfranchised grief. Your immediate support community is denying you the support you need to process your ex's death in a healthy, empathetic, validating way.  Instead, your wife is telling you that you are not allowed to feel sad, and that the natural thoughts that arise with such a loss regarding your own history with the said person and their struggles should not be allowed to arise.  Both of these reactions from your wife are damaging: You cannot legislate emotions and event-triggered ruminations. This kind of response can be severely damaging in the long term if it doesn't turn around. It can lead to (if it hasn't already) a significant attachment injury to your marriage.   \n\n\nI'm sorry your wife is responding this way. I, a married woman, hope she recognizes that her responses are guided by recalcitrant emotions, apologizes, and offers you the support, space, and listening ear that you need.", "NTA and I am sorry for your and your families loss.", "Your wife seems like the asshole.", "NTA. Your wife lacks empathy", "Your wife is a monster. I have worse to say, but....", "NTA. Your wife is being petty about this.

However, just because you dont see something as a problem, doesn't mean it's not a problem for your partner.

Got clean, fell off the wagon, got clean... they were never \"junkies\" to me. They were friends/family with issues. I mean I'm on the Autism spectrum and I know I come off pretty callous sometimes with not understanding emotional reactions or why people are upset about things and even I'm going \"dude, wtf\" to your wife's reaction. This was someone who once meant a lot to you, who you had to walk away from when she was in a rough place, and you've found out she lost her struggle (which I assume from the notes you made about finding out more about her death) and it's a terrible thing when loved ones succumb to that, and terrible still she leaves behind a child who will probably not understand for a long time, if ever. I wish she had shown these colors to you before you tied yourself to her because this is a narcissistic AH who has no basic respect for human life unless, apparently, they're the type of people she approves of.  \n\n\nYou absolutely should not have had to push aside your grief over a death to go to some Christmas party.

You are worried you didn't do enough to save ex? What would have been enough? Staying with her? You are endangering your marriage for someone you have long decided to break up with and who is tragically no longer here.", "NTA your wife is being pathetic about this. Losing someone to addiction is hard - I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm bucki g the trend. YTA.  She was ex. Yes, feel bad for her as a human being, but that is someone  from whom you have cleaved yourself. The reasons behind your cleaving is what killed her. \n\nNot saying she was a bad person, but a person who chose their path. \n\nAs for your wife...she needs to lighten up. You undoubtedly have some obviously unresolved feelings. You both need to talk, not yell.\n\nNow, going out on a limb...did you also have substance  issues? I ask as rarely is one partner has the issues. Is your wife concerned  about that lifestyle and former life?\n\nI admit, when I move on, I move on, so I may be a little harsh. But you made your choice in companions, and it wasn't the one who passed.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds like she has no empathy for those who struggle. \n\nYou are mourning your ex but you\u2019re also mourning so much more: the loss of who she could have been, the loss of any more chances for her to heal, and yes, the loss of what you both could have had without addiction. Not to mention the pain this causes her loved ones, who you likely also knew cared about.\n\nYour wife wasn\u2019t directly affected by your ex in any negative way. In fact the exact opposite is true: you are partially the partner you are because of your experiences with her. She has no reason to feel angry and every reason to feel support and compassion.\n\nI would argue it\u2019s not normal to criticize someone for mourning someone that played a huge part in their life.

Ever since we met I\u2019ve gone with her to a holiday party hosted by her and her best friend. It\u2019s a fairly large party, that grows every year. This year I did not attend, my wife is still pretty upset with why I didn\u2019t. \n\nTwo days before the party I was notified my ex fianc\u00e9e had passed. I didn\u2019t know the details, but it hit me very hard. To be honest, towards the end of things we didn\u2019t have the best relationship and I\u2019ll spare those details.

I told my wife I was going to skip the party. When I was first notified I told my wife to which she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you ok?\u201c I thought she would understand my reasoning, but she did not. She was quite offended I was bothered enough about my ex that I wouldn\u2019t feel up to her party. \n\nAfter the party she came home and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re this upset about some junkie.\u201d I was honestly taken back by her cold, callous attitude. My ex was a daughter, a mother, a sister. She was somebody that was messed up from life. I spent the next several days and into Christmas putting on a fake happy face and tried not thinking about my ex. \n\nOver the weekend I had more calls about the details involving her death, which further upset me. My wife noticing something was off with me asked if I still loved her (my ex), and is that why I\u2019m \u2018devastated.\u2019 She said it\u2019s weird how I\u2019m mourning the loss of my ex when I haven\u2019t had anything to do with her in years.

She became angered by that, saying she doesn\u2019t want to go near a junkie\u2019s funeral because the place will be full of addicts. Which might be partially true but I think I should be allowed to pay my last respects regardless. She told me if I end up going, \u2018we\u2019re going to have problems.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she meant by that, but she threw in my face how this \u2018ruined\u2019 our holiday and again stated she can\u2019t believe I missed her party because of my ex. She told me I need to seek professional help because it\u2019s not normal for a married man to be upset about his ex dying. \n\nI began thinking maybe she\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m mourning her loss. I began asking myself if I still had feelings for my ex, but in my head I knew things were done. I wouldn\u2019t have married my wife if I felt things weren\u2019t finished with a previous relationship. I\u2019ve practically stopped myself from grieving because I guess it shouldn\u2019t have mattered to me. I asked my wife if she\u2019d be upset if her ex died, she said that\u2019s different because she shares a child with him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You left her (rightly) due to her addiction. Perhaps the feelings are misplaced regrets at not being able to help her, especially if her death was related to her addiction. \n\nI think that you really did get over the relationship from a romantic perspective, but she was once important to you and that doesn't go away. You cared for her and that means something. \n\nFeel your feelings and process your grief. I'd worry about your wife afterwards. When you're in a clearer frame of mind and can understand it yourself, you'll be able to explain it to her. And like when she stopped bitching about the narcan, if she cares about you she'll get over it as well.", "NTA and I find it very hard to believe your wife's life has not been touched in some way by addiction - although if it was extremely negative and she never worked through it, that may explain some of her incredibly cruel behavior now. It still would not excuse it.", "NTA, but huge red flags with your wife", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was married I found out that my first love had died in a motorcycle accident about 6 months after it happened. I took it badly for many reasons and I ended up taking myself to therapy about a month later. I sorted through my feelings and got some perspective. \n\nFeelings are complicated and I wish your wife was more compassionate. I can understand her having some feelings about this but the derogatory comments and ultimatum are not constructive ways to heal this for either of you. If she feels insecure or hurt she should say so. Otherwise her harmful words are going to drive a permanent rift between you. \n\nOP, please allow yourself to feel your feelings. If you repress these feelings it will only make things worse and they will surface again eventually. Get yourself some counseling and have a talk with your wife. You can\u2019t control her but you can control you. If she can\u2019t be helpful then at least ask her to not be hurtful while you sort this out in your head. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "Nta. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

None of us are immune.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all I'm sorry for your loss. \nYou're not wrong for grieving, just because things didn't work out doesn't mean you wished her ill will. This is a woman that at one point you loved so much you wanted to spend the rest of your life with her. Unfortunately due to her addiction that was not possible. \nHonestly I'm very concerned about your wife's response. Just because your ex was an addict that doesn't mean she was a bad person and her jealously over someone who has passed away needs to stop. \nShe's trying to manipulate and belittle you instead of acknowledge that her behavior is the problem.

I think a lot of people have a hard time with the concept that you can still love an ex-partner without being IN-LOVE with them. Not all break ups end in a fiery ball of hate, sometimes the relationship just isn't right and you move on.\n\nIt's kind of the same with friendships. My childhood best friend and I don't talk very often, but when we see each other, it's like no time has passed. I moved out of state almost a decade ago, and with the pandemic I haven't seen them in a couple years. We mostly just exchange messages on holidays and birthdays now. I'd still be devastated if I learned something had happened to them even though \"we haven't spoken in years\"\n\nYour ex was a significant part of your life. You're allowed to grieve.", "NTA.  I will say getting some professional help to process your grief may be helpful as this loss is more complicated than a \"normal\" loss, IMO.  Heck, I'd even go so far as to say you and your wife should get help together as well to help her understand what you are feeling, because she is entirely in the wrong here.\n\nFWIW, a couple years ago the first woman I dated passed away suddenly.  We hadn't spoken in 15-ish years (it was a high school relationship) but I still felt a sense of loss with her passing.  Just because you weren't in an active relationship with that person doesn't mean that their passing won't have an effect on you.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds incredibly heartless and cruel making those snide remarks, and showing her own jealousy and insecurity towards your memories.\n\nBad enough your ex fiance struggled with addiction issues, but literally insulting a dead woman and throwing it in your face is frankly a seriously fucked up behavior.\n\nI think you already have problems here, namely with your wife's lack of respect and abusive attitude. And yes, you should get grief counseling and potentially a divorce attorney.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry for your loss.  \n\nI went through this a year ago. My ex was an addict in recovery, and still had some messed up abusive relationships in his life that led to us breaking up, which was devastating for me. He died by suicide a few months later (it was exactly a year ago) and I'm still feeling it now. I'm in a new relationship with someone and it's going wonderfully, but I still have some dreams.\n\nI do suggest grief therapy if you have the means.

NTA.\nYour wife is jealous and insensitive. :(", "NTA- your wife sounds like an unsympathetic and judgmental / insecure partner. I am so sorry for your loss, however the relationship ended, she was a significant person in your life and of course you're going to feel the impact of her death.", "NTA. I have been married for 24 years. My husband and I both almost married other people. If the man I almost married before I met my husband died, I would likely need a few days to process that. Not because I still love him, but because he was a big part of my past. If my husband's forever fiance's passed, I would expect her would mourn and I would support that.", "Nta.

But your wife is waving so many red flags I\u2019d suggest you try to get her to do marriage counselling", "I am so sorry for your loss. I completely understand how you feel.  NTA", "NTA. I can't believe the death of a person is such an 'inconvenience' to her. How callous.\n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss.", "Jeez NTA. You\u2019re not in love with her because you are mourning her loss. I\u2019m sure you recognize and remember the person she was beneath the addiction and it\u2019s really hard to watch people succumb to that. On top of it you are feeling a lot of guilt over things and probably replaying all the things you think you could\u2019ve done different. Not necessarily to save the relationship, but things you feel that could\u2019ve changed the outcome. For what it\u2019s worth, there\u2019s nothing you could have done or changed, but I can be empathetic to how it must feel for you, and I don\u2019t even know you or her.\n\nIt\u2019s something that really shouldn\u2019t be hard for a sympathetic person to understand. But clearly she doesn\u2019t at all, and has just decided that you think she\u2019s the one that got away or something.\n\nIdk I could probably understand if she just said \u201cI don\u2019t understand, please talk to me so I can understand this. Because it makes me feel like you were still in love with her or something.\u201d But instead she just accused you of that and keeps calling her a junkie. That IS callous and cold hearted, both to the EX but especially to you.", "ESH  You are hurting your WIFE.  If what you are saying is true and your ex is truely an ex then why are you so hurt by her passing.  She may sound callous but im guessing she is more insecure.  You were an AH to skip her Christmas party and If you go to the funeral for someone who you havent seen in years you will further hurt your wife and marriage.  I wont say going to the funeral makes you an AH but you have marital issues that you caused.  If she was still using at her death there could be other users there.  Did you ever have a problem or even use?  Is that why your wife doesnt want you around that crowd?  There is not one ex my husband or I would go to their funeral.  Not that we ended all on bad terms but they are in our past for a good reason.  Why are you bringing your ex back in.", "Thank you. My wife doesn\u2019t understand that for one thing I value life. I feel almost guilty for giving up on my ex and not trying to harder to get her help. I feel bad for her son, that needlessly lost his mother so early in life. There\u2019s a lot more to it than this woman dying, but my wife doesn\u2019t see that.", "She doesn\u2019t understand addiction at all, and how it mostly is a coping mechanism. Since being with my ex and around that lifestyle I always carry narcan. She didn\u2019t understand for awhile because she says it\u2019s their choice to use and death is the consequence of using. But about a year ago we were out and someone OD\u2019d. I used narcan on him, she finally stopped nitpicking.", "I left my ex 7 years ago, although we were off and on for about a year after. Mainly because I fell for her promises to get clean, or she\u2019d call in the middle of the night with an emergency that turned out not being an emergency but just another manipulation tactic. I was inexperienced dealing with an addict then, until I learned about enabling them. My now wife and I met 5 years ago, my ex was still in contact with me but I hadn\u2019t seen her in months. I never saw her again after we met, but eventually I went NC.", "I didn\u2019t answer the part about the calls. It\u2019s a friend of my ex\u2019s family.

It's more of a question of segmented assholery if you may. \n\nYou know your wife, you know that this episode does not 1000000% describe with perfect accuracy who she is, her levels of empathy or understanding. You cannot rely on strangers' views for this. \n\nIs she an asshole on the particular segment of using crude words like 'junkie' and talking about 'consequences' of addiction? I think so. \n\nIt's a bit heavy to express yourself this way about someone who died, especially someone who left behind a child. In this sense yeah she is the asshole.\n\n*But.* \n\nI think it's because she didn't know the extent to which you cared about your ex. She probably felt like you were too emotionally invested in the passing of an ex with whom you cut ties years before. Maybe she felt unsure, surprised, betrayed, shocked, like the rug was being pulled from under her feet, etc. I would feel the same way. \n\nIt's one thing to be saddened by the passing of a person from your past - absolutely normal.\n\nIt's a different thing to feel deeply affected emotionally, to the point of your mood being altered so drastically that you become incapable of engaging in traditional social engagements you do with your wife especially during the holidays. The fact that you are receiving phone calls related to your ex and are actively discussing details related to the passing, particularly as the ex is someone who again you mention you haven't had anything to do in *seven years,* most likely makes your wife unsure and very uncomfortable.\n\nIt's not because she is 'inhuman' or 'lacks empathy', it's because your reaction feels *unnatural* to her, your grief is disproportional to the extent of the relationship with your ex (zero, for seven years).

I definitely judge hell out of anyone who puts their close ones through similar abuse I went through.\n While addiction is a sickness an addict's beha iour (not the addiction itself) can be traumatizing for the people who have to witness it. Addicts don't get a pass for hurting people just because they're addicted. \n\nClearly that is not the case here since OP's wife wasn't the one hurt by the ex. So wife has no grounds to judge.\n\nBut nevertheless while addiction itself shouldn't be judged since it really isn't something a person can opt out of, addiction can come with a lot of toxic behaviour and that doesn't get a pass.\n\nAgain, not relevant for this case but just wanted to share a bit different viewpoint to who can judge and what, having seen some pretty toxic behavior at close range", "I'm definitely not condoning any behavior that comes from addiction, especially after my own painful experiences dealing with loved ones with addiction. \n\nIt's easy for the wife to judge the ex, because she doesn't know her and simply write her off as \"just a junkie\". She doesn't see that there's a person (Daughter, mother, friend) behind the \"junkie\". \nWife having zero empathy is what bothers me, that's all."]}
