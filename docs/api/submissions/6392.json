Ever since we met I\u2019ve gone with her to a holiday party hosted by her and her best friend. It\u2019s a fairly large party, that grows every year. This year I did not attend, my wife is still pretty upset with why I didn\u2019t. \n\nTwo days before the party I was notified my ex fianc\u00e9e had passed. I didn\u2019t know the details, but it hit me very hard. To be honest, towards the end of things we didn\u2019t have the best relationship and I\u2019ll spare those details. She was an addict and had relapsed which heavily influenced the ending of our relationship. I went through a lot of grief leaving her in that state, maybe it hit me because I feel like I didn\u2019t do enough to help her. \n\nIn any case, I was pretty down and did not feel like socializing. I told my wife I was going to skip the party. When I was first notified I told my wife to which she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you ok?\u201c I thought she would understand my reasoning, but she did not. She was quite offended I was bothered enough about my ex that I wouldn\u2019t feel up to her party. \n\nAfter the party she came home and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re this upset about some junkie.\u201d I was honestly taken back by her cold, callous attitude. My ex was a daughter, a mother, a sister. She was somebody that was messed up from life. I spent the next several days and into Christmas putting on a fake happy face and tried not thinking about my ex. \n\nOver the weekend I had more calls about the details involving her death, which further upset me. My wife noticing something was off with me asked if I still loved her (my ex), and is that why I\u2019m \u2018devastated.\u2019 She said it\u2019s weird how I\u2019m mourning the loss of my ex when I haven\u2019t had anything to do with her in years. I explained to my wife she (my ex) was my first love and I did love her as a person. \n\nLast night I told my wife I will be attending my ex\u2019s funeral and I\u2019d like for her to come if she wanted. She became angered by that, saying she doesn\u2019t want to go near a junkie\u2019s funeral because the place will be full of addicts. Which might be partially true but I think I should be allowed to pay my last respects regardless. She told me if I end up going, \u2018we\u2019re going to have problems.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she meant by that, but she threw in my face how this \u2018ruined\u2019 our holiday and again stated she can\u2019t believe I missed her party because of my ex. She told me I need to seek professional help because it\u2019s not normal for a married man to be upset about his ex dying. \n\nI began thinking maybe she\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m mourning her loss. I began asking myself if I still had feelings for my ex, but in my head I knew things were done. I wouldn\u2019t have married my wife if I felt things weren\u2019t finished with a previous relationship. I\u2019ve practically stopped myself from grieving because I guess it shouldn\u2019t have mattered to me. I asked my wife if she\u2019d be upset if her ex died, she said that\u2019s different because she shares a child with him.", "created_utc": 1672765368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102d890/aita_for_missing_my_wifes_annual_christmas_party/", "score": 4343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a very mean-spirited response to the death of someone you once loved and cared about. I dated a guy in freaking middle school (7th-8th) and he died tragically at 25. I was crushed! And guess what, my husband supported me through it because I still cared for him. The fact that she was your ex-fiance who you had love for makes your wife even more of an AH. I don't care that she was stuck in addiction. She was still a human who deserves to be mourned by those who loved her and remember her, despite her flaws. Way to be jealous of a dead person, sheesh", "NTA 100%. Just because an ex dies, you shouldn't care?? That's cold and heartless of her and honestly, I would be a bit concerned with her lack of empathy for you. Saying that it is different if her ex died because they had a kid is a cop out and she knows it. A first love is special, even after a breakup with them. Don't let her get you down, stick to your feelings and don't let her control how you should be feeling.", "Holy hell. NTA. Your wife is showing a truly disturbing lack of empathy.", "NTA. Your wife is rude and has little empathy towards addiction, which is a disease. It\u2019s people like her that make it hard for recovering addicts to get places. I would absolutely mourn the loss of a loved one. Just because you weren\u2019t still in love with her doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t have love in your heart for her as a person.

This is something I understand, because I struggle with my own jealous tendencies, but your wife is not being reasonable. In fact, she's being quite cruel and hateful.\n\nMy mom was a junkie. She was very flawed. She was also a sweet, loving, fun, compassionate woman who had been destroyed by life and was just... coping. I'd be fucking LIVID if anyone talked about her the way your wife talked about your former fiance.", "Ican understand you feeling upset you loved this person at one time but I also see your wife\u2019s side. You have basically shut her out and are moping around the house acting like this person has been in your life for the last few years.  You can certainly be sad and want to go to her funeral but you have also shut your wife out, ignored your Christmas/New Years plans because someone from your past has died. You are acting like you were close to this person now.  If i was your wife I would be concerned about the way you are acting too.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife lacks basic human empathy. Her annual party is not more important than a funeral. What a shallow and tacky response.\n\nShe needs to stop being so cruel about your ex and judging people who have the DECENCY to pay their respects. \n\nThe double standard with her ex is ridiculous.

Your wife not understanding it is not normal.", "It is totally normal. I don't know what is up with your wife, but it is not a good look. NTA. Get some support. Help. Grieve.

NTA, but you should get some professional help to find out why you are with a woman like this.", "NTA. Your wife feels threatened and insecure, which can happen. But her attitude towards someone who has just died and you for grieving her loss, it's too much. Honestly, she sounds like a bad person.", "NTA. Your wife sounds very cold about this subject and she's a hypocrite! What does it matter if her and her ex have a kid? Basically she'd be allowed to grieve him if he died and yet you can't grieve your ex. That's a double standard! She should be willing to go with you to the funeral and support you while you're going through this.", "I think your wife needs help for see what her selfishness and lack of empathy is about\n\nNTA", "NTA.

What she could have accomplished had her illness not taken her over, what she could have made of herself, the things she could have done- that\u2019s a loss. Even those that love her deeply may feel they lost her long ago to her addictions, but they will still mourn the loss of what could\u2019ve been.", "NAH but I wouldn\u2019t go or you\u2019re going to be mourning your relationship pretty soon after. The past needs to be left in the past.", "NAH. I get why your wife is mad. This looks bad. Like you're still in love with ex and only settled for your wife. But you're entitled to your feelings, whatever they are.", "NAH\n\nI know many are saying your ex is being cruel and callous, and I do see that she is having a double standard saying it would be different if her ex died because they have a child together.\n\nBut try to see it this way: your WIFE has been BLINDSIDED by something that was not even remotely on her radar, during the most stressful time of year (the holidays may have a reputation as being jolly and fun, but it\u2019s actually a stressful and depressing time; it\u2019s no coincidence that suicides are more common at this time of year. The holidays are a trigger and bummer for many people). \n\nYour wife may not be handling this situation well, but I don\u2019t think you are either. You have been blindsided as well, and I think that\u2019s because you didn\u2019t finish grieving the relationship with your ex while she was alive. Unless someone is still friends with an ex, has a child and is co-parenting with an ex, business partners with an ex, or any other situation where the ex is still a regular part of their daily life, I think it shows a level of emotional entanglement to grieve like you are, 7 years after the relationship has ended. I don\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t deserve to grieve at all. But there is a difference between quietly grieving and feeling the pain and the temporary nature of life and love, the mortality of our existence - and being so torn up you\u2019re putting on a fake face and can\u2019t go to a holiday party hosted by your own wife. There are levels of grieving, and the level that you grieved for your ex\u2019s death was too intense for your wife not to be upset by, and too intense for the situation. You should have closed this chapter years ago. The grief should have been different, a less severe grief. \n\nI would be upset if I were your wife, too. People are saying she lacks empathy, but I think you also lacked empathy for her, if you couldn\u2019t understand why something from out of the blue like this that hit you so hard, would also affect your wife.\n\nHowever, I do not think this makes you an asshole! We are all human and being a human is complicated! But I do not think your wife is an asshole either. I think you two should go to counseling and talk this through with a mediator who can help both of you see the other\u2019s perspective in a fair and balanced way. I think it is fair for you to want to go to the funeral, but I also think it\u2019s fair for your wife to be upset by that, and for her to not want to go. \n\nEveryone being so harsh towards your wife are coming from a place of kindness towards you, but I think it\u2019s possible if your wife wrote up her own version of this (including details about her own stress surrounding the holidays, the shock of your grief, being blindsided by all this, etc) it\u2019s very possible people could see from your wife\u2019s POV and understand she is not an evil or callous person. She is human, just like you, and neither of you are perfect, it\u2019s the nature of being human.", "INFO: kinda seems like ages and times matter here no? You\u2019ve been married for 3 years, but how long has it been since you broke up with your ex? \n\nIf things ended so poorly, why are you still receiving so many \u201ccalls\u201d about her death? It\u2019s tragic yes, but I guess I\u2019m just confused as to how you\u2019re getting all these \u201cupdates\u201d if you weren\u2019t involved in her life at all?\n\nETA: going for NAH. With the context you provided, it\u2019s pretty clear your wife is concerned about revisiting this chapter of your life. Your ex was manipulative and emotionally abusive, it\u2019s probably hard for your wife to come to terms with the fact that this has been affecting your for weeks, and now you\u2019re going to the funeral. \n\nIt defo comes off like you\u2019re not over her, especially from the line you used \u201cI invested a lot into her and I think it\u2019s only fair I was informed\u201d. If that\u2019s true, why didn\u2019t your ex\u2019s family reach out to you? Why the \u201cfriend of my ex\u2019s family who\u2019s mom is friends with my mom\u201d?

I lost someone who was a fundamental part of making me who I am. I went to his funeral. It wasn\u2019t because I was still in love with him or because he was a threat to my current relationship at the time. It was because I loved him as a person. As someone who knew the depths of me. As someone I\u2019d wanted to succeed and be happy.. and now he won\u2019t get to. He won\u2019t be get to see his sons grow up. He won\u2019t get to find a wife. Nothing. I understand how you likely feel OP. I\u2019m sorry that your wife is acting like this.. she needs to understand that there\u2019s no reason to be jealous of the dead and letting you mourn is the healthy thing to do. (Assuming you don\u2019t become obsessed with your ex or something) \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your wife is heartless, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be upset to find out someone you once loved has died, my grandad died a month ago and my grandmother was upset even though they haven\u2019t been together for 23 years and their relationship prior wasn\u2019t that great, there\u2019s no feelings on either side but losing someone who was once in your life, will most likely have some effect over you, your wife seems petty and insecure and seems to be battling a competition with your dead ex. You are allowed to grieve your loss.", "Wow. NTA. However-your wife sounds extremely insensitive at best and a total asshole at worst. I\u2019m a recovering addict and I know how incredibly hard it is to get out of that. It almost always stems from trauma and trying to escape the feelings associated with that. Maybe she\u2019s ignorant, as many people are, but it\u2019s still so nasty of her to speak of someone like that. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand it. That was someone\u2019s mother, daughter, and sister that died, as you said. What awful things to say about that person. I\u2019m surprised that doesn\u2019t bother you more as it shows what kind of person she is. \n\nI have lost many people in my past to addiction, including an ex. My husband was very understanding of my need to grieve, go to the funerals, and understood when I struggle on the annual date my ex died-even 12 years later. He has never spoken negatively about anyone. He was able to put any selfishness or jealousy aside for what I needed in the moment. Anything less than that is not fair to you. \n\n*You are allowed to mourn and grieve however you feel you need to.* If she doesn\u2019t give you time to do that, then maybe you should be the one to tell her that you will have problems. I\u2019m so sorry that your ex didn\u2019t make it out of addiction. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. Your wife's reaction is incredibly callous and unsupportive and a massive red flag. You don't need anyone's permission to grieve or feel the loss of your ex's passing. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA - men get out of there. Your wife doesn't even respect and understand your sadness... Threaten you is also a big red flag \ud83d\udea9 \n\nI'ts common sense that you get sad from someone you knew.", "NTA.

Someone who was once close to you passing is sad and you should be allowed to grieve, no matter what relationship you had. Your wife is TA and jealous of a dead person.", "I agree with your wife\u2019s sentiment that you need to speak to a professional but I think the professional in question needs to be a divorce lawyer because holy crap your wife is the AH here and by aLOT", "NTA your wife sounds cruel.", "NTA. Just because she was your ex doesn't mean you're not allowed to have any feelings at all regarding her. You're allowed to CARE when someone who had been in your life passes. Your wife is absolutely in the wrong about the whole situation.", "NTA.. your wife is jealous among other things.\n\nYour ex was still part of your life and that is all there is to it\u2026 pls go to the funeral..\n\nIf your wife is so threatened by your compassion for another human being so be it.. you dont need someone in your life who is that insecure.", "Whoa.  NTA. Your wife, though...   \n\n\nI'm sorry that you are with someone who doesn't understand addiction, that people with addictions are so much more than their addictions, and that the end of a relationship does not indicate an utter lack of care or indifference toward a person.  Your emotional response indicates a genuine concern for a person, even if that person is a distant memory and has no influence over your daily life.  It indicates that you truly care for the people you involve yourself with - the whole person, not just what kind of transactional benefits you get from the person.   \n\n\nThere is a *right* floating around in certain psychology circles: The right to grieve. What you are experiencing is known as disenfranchised grief. Your immediate support community is denying you the support you need to process your ex's death in a healthy, empathetic, validating way.  Instead, your wife is telling you that you are not allowed to feel sad, and that the natural thoughts that arise with such a loss regarding your own history with the said person and their struggles should not be allowed to arise.  Both of these reactions from your wife are damaging: You cannot legislate emotions and event-triggered ruminations. This kind of response can be severely damaging in the long term if it doesn't turn around. It can lead to (if it hasn't already) a significant attachment injury to your marriage.   \n\n\nI'm sorry your wife is responding this way. I, a married woman, hope she recognizes that her responses are guided by recalcitrant emotions, apologizes, and offers you the support, space, and listening ear that you need.", "NTA and I am sorry for your and your families loss.", "Your wife seems like the asshole.\n\nEdit: I find it hilarious that all the people that love unhealthy relationships are desperately downvoting all posts accurately calling the wife an asshole.", "NTA. Your wife lacks empathy", "Your wife is a monster. I have worse to say, but....", "NTA. Your wife is being petty about this.

I mean I'm on the Autism spectrum and I know I come off pretty callous sometimes with not understanding emotional reactions or why people are upset about things and even I'm going \"dude, wtf\" to your wife's reaction. This was someone who once meant a lot to you, who you had to walk away from when she was in a rough place, and you've found out she lost her struggle (which I assume from the notes you made about finding out more about her death) and it's a terrible thing when loved ones succumb to that, and terrible still she leaves behind a child who will probably not understand for a long time, if ever.

Seeing your grief and regret now is making her question your relationship. I get she is insensitive throwing \"junkie\" around, but she is lashing out in hurt. YTA for not seeing this. You are worried you didn't do enough to save ex? What would have been enough? Staying with her? You are endangering your marriage for someone you have long decided to break up with and who is tragically no longer here.", "NTA your wife is being pathetic about this. Losing someone to addiction is hard - I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm bucki g the trend. YTA.  She was ex. Yes, feel bad for her as a human being, but that is someone  from whom you have cleaved yourself. The reasons behind your cleaving is what killed her. \n\nNot saying she was a bad person, but a person who chose their path. \n\nAs for your wife...she needs to lighten up. You undoubtedly have some obviously unresolved feelings. You both need to talk, not yell.\n\nNow, going out on a limb...did you also have substance  issues? I ask as rarely is one partner has the issues. Is your wife concerned  about that lifestyle and former life?\n\nI admit, when I move on, I move on, so I may be a little harsh. But you made your choice in companions, and it wasn't the one who passed.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds like she has no empathy for those who struggle. \n\nYou are mourning your ex but you\u2019re also mourning so much more: the loss of who she could have been, the loss of any more chances for her to heal, and yes, the loss of what you both could have had without addiction. Not to mention the pain this causes her loved ones, who you likely also knew cared about.\n\nYour wife wasn\u2019t directly affected by your ex in any negative way. In fact the exact opposite is true: you are partially the partner you are because of your experiences with her. She has no reason to feel angry and every reason to feel support and compassion.\n\nI would argue it\u2019s not normal to criticize someone for mourning someone that played a huge part in their life.

I explained to my wife she (my ex) was my first love and I did love her as a person. \n\nLast night I told my wife I will be attending my ex\u2019s funeral and I\u2019d like for her to come if she wanted. She became angered by that, saying she doesn\u2019t want to go near a junkie\u2019s funeral because the place will be full of addicts. Which might be partially true but I think I should be allowed to pay my last respects regardless. She told me if I end up going, \u2018we\u2019re going to have problems.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what she meant by that, but she threw in my face how this \u2018ruined\u2019 our holiday and again stated she can\u2019t believe I missed her party because of my ex. She told me I need to seek professional help because it\u2019s not normal for a married man to be upset about his ex dying. \n\nI began thinking maybe she\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m mourning her loss. I began asking myself if I still had feelings for my ex, but in my head I knew things were done. I wouldn\u2019t have married my wife if I felt things weren\u2019t finished with a previous relationship. I\u2019ve practically stopped myself from grieving because I guess it shouldn\u2019t have mattered to me. I asked my wife if she\u2019d be upset if her ex died, she said that\u2019s different because she shares a child with him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Something they can blame, so they can call their ex the bad person and move on. But that's not everyone. I had a long term relationship, ultimately we split due to distance and some untreated PTSD. I still believe my ex was a kind and loving person,  and while we both made mistakes, I still care about them as a human being and someone who made a major and (mostly) positive impact on my life. We've both since moved on, gotten married, had children, etc, and haven't spoken in nearly a decade. But if I heard something happened to my ex, yes I would absolutely grieve. It's not that I am still in love, or wish for a reconciliation or anything of the sort, it's that someone I once deeply cared for is gone forever, that their family and friends lost someone special to them. That they didn't get to live to old age and spread joy to those around them. I would feel similarly if I found out a good friend I had lost touch with died. In fact, I have felt this with a childhood friend who died, that I lost touch with over the years.\nI'm sorry that your wife has apparently not previously had a healthy enough relationship to understand that not all break ups end in hate, and I'm sorry not only that you are grieving a loss, but that you are not getting the support you need.

And she is refusing to acknowledge that it is possible to have loved someone and accepted that you were not good for each other and let them go.

She should also be supporting you and going to the funeral.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou sound like a very empathetic and compassionate person and that is wonderful. I can see how your wife could be feeling insecure, but it is totally normal and natural to grieve the loss of someone who you were close with/cared about, even if they haven't been in your life for a long while, and even if it ended on a bad note. It also sounds like you did a good amount of introspection, and that is great.I think maybe your wife needs reassurance/reminder that you can care about someone without being in love with them. Your ex remains a chapter of your past, and losing her is, in a way, losing a piece of your past, and you mentioned her being your first love- I can see how that would add an additional layer of significance. Plus you saw her dealing with her addiction and tried to help her and became emotionally invested in her recovery- while it is 100% not your fault that she lost the fight, I can see how it would additionally hurt to have her addiction play a role in her death. I think this has likely opened some old wounds for you.  \n\n\nMy ultimate advice to you is: don't avoid grieving, that isn't healthy. I suspect your wife is feeling sidelined or jealous/insecure, and I don't mean that as an insult, I've had my own issues there. That doesn't mean she is absolved of being the asshole here, though, she definitely is, for her words and for her vague threat over you attending the funeral. Honestly, it sounds to me like your wife may need some therapy, and/or couple's therapy to try to find the source of why she is feeling this way. Was she already feeling somewhat insecure and this brought it out strongly? I know you did try talking to your wife already, maybe give a little space for her to calm down and then try again. Try to reassure your wife that while you can't just not care about your ex's passing, you are in love your wife and your ex is not a threat to that. I don't just mean with words, try to reassure her with actions, too, though I understand very well that grief doesn't leave much room for feeling romantic or social. Whether you get professional help yourself about this is up to you, some people do find it helpful to get professional help with processing their grief and loss, but it is important to remember that feeling the way you do is completely normal and natural, it is not something wrong with you. Your wife is also wrong about it being totally different because she has a kid with her ex. That's kinda like saying you can't be sad about an old friend you lost touch with dying. With all due respect, your wife is way out of line here, but in my unprofessional opinion it sounds to me that she is likely reacting this way due to her own emotions and not knowing how to handle this, rather than bad intent. Ultimately everyone experiences grief differently, and as my partner says, there are no rules to grief. I think going to the funeral is a good idea, even if you go alone.  \n\n\nSide note, I have spoken to my first bf maybe five or less times in the last decade and I still care about him even though I am over him romantically and had many relationships since and am in a happy relationship now. I know I would be devastated if he died and even if I don't talk to him at all for decades it would still hit me hard. I think that's just part of genuinely caring about people.  \n\n\n  \nBIG EDIT: Uhh, I just read some comments and your wife doesn't like you helping people who are ODing?! You may want to disregard my advice for fixing this relationship and consider leaving her and finding someone who shares your empathy and compassion for addicts. Yikes. It sounds like there were already some big issues here, and with her.  \nSmall Edit: formatting and adding a couple little things I forgot.", "NTA.

She honestly sounds super judgmental and gross. I\u2019m hoping this is a flawed area of her mind and not how she typically is. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and for your wife making it all about her and more difficult on you. I would personally see a therapist/grief counselor, but I know that isn\u2019t for everyone. And if you feel you should go to the funeral then please do - you can\u2019t go back and do it again if you miss it and regret it over your wife being bitter and cold. She needs a sit down and talk to her and be firm, but honestly idk that that will even budge her. I\u2019m honestly not even sure what advice to try to give with her. I would be so disgusted and angry at her for her reaction(s) about it and saying such mean things without need so that is clouding my judgment.", "Seriously think about the fact that your wife sees addicted people as inhuman. It is disturbing. Imagine if someone in your life currently would become addicted or possible even future kids would become addicted (if you ever want them of course). Would your wife just leave them alone and told them it's their own choice and consequences?", "When she married him, she vowed to stick by him through thick and thin. Does this sound like she\u2019s being considerate of his feelings? Absolutely not. He deserves the time and space to grieve no matter if it\u2019s inconvenient for her. \n\n**fucking HUMAN LIFE** >>>>>>>> a holiday party \n\nNTA", "That's the take of a 12 year old, not a fully grown woman. Adults know they will not always come first and trying to deny him the chance to grieve is a move beyond AITA's pay grade.", "My childhood best friend OD'd when we were 17. We hadn't interacted in a few months at that time because I could no longer offer him any help without it being to my detriment. I still loved him, I still do. When he passed it was the worst feeling in the world. I know I did all I could realistically, but I wish others remember the good parts of him, his creativity and tenderness, the ability to make me feel safe without saying any words. He left a profound impact on me, and knowing I'd never see him smile again still leaves me kinda hollow, and it was 8 years ago", "I\u2019ve never even had a relationship longer than a year before my current one, and there are still a few exes I\u2019d cry at the loss of, despite no longer being in contact. Just because I used to care for them, and death makes me horribly sad.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how cold and uncaring this wife must be to speak this way about an ex fianc\u00e9e\u2026", "-No one, ever, gets to tell you how you should grieve.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the actions you take in that grief just magically don't hurt other people. The wife likely feels completely blindsided and hurt by such a strong reaction after 7 years of nothing.", "This is honestly what makes it heartbreaking.\n\nYou know what the addiction takes away from them and who they could be or are.\n\nBut you can't be around them even though you love them and wish them well and want to be able to have relationships with them because who they are when they use isn't good for you.", "Why should he put himself in his wife's shoes? Such callousness and cruelty should not be explained and justified. It should be shut down, immediately.", "You know what? If I were seriously ill during that time, yes I\u2019d expect my husband to manage his grief enough to take me in to seek medical care and care for our pets and children\n\nIf it was a holiday party/family visit/vacation/hobby of mine?\nThen what I as his wife would need the most would be for him to take the time he needed to work through his grief. To take care of himself.\nWould I be fearful/hurt/worried what his emotions meant for/about our relationship? Maybe. I don\u2019t know. But I do know I would table those feelings until we as a couple were ready to address that", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Reading your post I could feel the emotion here. This young man unfortunately didn\u2019t get to share his gifts with the world. That\u2019s so sad to me. What he did do though is share his gifts with you so you can share them with the world. Honor his memory the best you can. The way he died is irrelevant to me. He sounds like he was a good guy with an unfortunate problem. Hold onto your memories, they sustain us.", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s what struck a nerve the most with me - my brother was an addict and I would never in a million years call him or anyone else a junkie - it\u2019s such a derogatory thing for what is a very serious illness.\n\nIt\u2019s dehumanising and also incredibly ignorant of the many varied reasons why and how people fall into addiction.", "When I was in high school, had a classmate that I grew up with, tragically died in a car accident. He was super fun and was a great guy to talk to. I still think of him every so often and wish he could be here still enjoying his life. His best friend has struggled so much since then, and I like to keep an eye on his Facebook just in case he needs a friend. Op is 100% NTA here. That was someone he loved, and for her to be gone sucks. Like for me, someone that I barely know that was a desk mate for class still makes me wanna cry every so often.", "You got me crying. I have an addiction and I know if I don't take care of myself it could be deadly. It stemmed from childhood trauma and people irl have been very apathetic towards me. I can't imagine someone speaking like this about someone struggling with addiction. Its horrible and keeps you trapped in this bubble of complete hopelessness.", "Him grieving over her death doesn't meen he still has feelings for her. Also a funeral is more important than a party. You can have parties whenever you want, we only get one funeral each.", "omg finally a sane comment. everyone acts like saints, but this is the only real answer to this", "People can bid farewell in a letter, with a counsellor, in prayer ,  doesn\u2019t have to be the funeral. His wife has good reason to be pissed ar this point he keeps checking out for ex", "Really? My marriage vows never said my husband had to attend every party I hosted.", "Except she really isn\u2019t \u201cwifing\u201d all that well right now\u2026.", "And his wife should be in therapy, so that she can deal with this very normal reaction he\u2019s having.", "Thank you, sincerely. Honestly when I think of him, \"addict\" is one of the last things I think of. The older I get without him, the more I realize how young he was. I know the day I turn 27 is going to be a hard one, but I try to give him a place in my life, he's a piece of my puzzle.", "I think your wife is probably upset at the importance your ex still has in your life and heart. It's making her question her place in your priorities and she's upset.", "TBH, I can imagine being upset about the death of my first boyfriend who was a huge positive influence in my life for 5 years and we parted with no hard feelings 10 years ago. I would not be so devastated and occupied with it as you seem to be right now. If I found out one of my other exes died, I couldn\u2019t care less. \n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s still feeling there. If my fianc\u00e9 acted like you did, I would not be pleased. So in my opinion, YTA. \n\nEdit: this also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that she\u2019s cold and lacks empathy. I would give my life for people who mean a lot to me. I\u2019m just very indifferent to my exes, especially when they wronged me. I can imagine that your wife thinks your reaction to this is really sus.", "Your the asshole . Your wife is a order of magnitude above ur ex sorry", "ESH, if I were your wife this reaction would be a major red flag for me. I think your wife\u2019s suggestion of therapy would be a good idea perhaps as a couple. I know I would need a professional to help me understand this one. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t feel anything but I don\u2019t think it should be to the point to where you don\u2019t want to celebrate the holidays with your wife, family, and friends. Your priorities seem off.", "NAH, but I find it very innapropiate to ask your wife to attend your ex's funeral. She was part of YOUR life, not hers, she doesn't even like her. I find a bit extreme her getting mad at you if you attend, because it's  your business how you grief. However, I would like you to think from her perspective: you left her alone on a special moment for her, because of someone she didn't like, and on top of that you want her to go to your event (the funeral) when you didn't even go to say hello to hers (the party).\n\nYOU are the one attached to your ex, your wife doesn't have to show any kind of empathy towards her, whether you like it or not (same for all NTA redditors). She should be more respectful of your feelings, of course. But please, don't let your grief forget that your wife is feeling that you care more about another woman than about her. You should address this when you are better because you both are failing to be in your partner's shoes.\n\nI hope you both can solve this and be happy again.", "YTA", "Shouldn\u2019t his wife be showing him compassion?", ">My wife doesn\u2019t understand that for one thing I value life. \n\nThis is what an AH says. I really feel like you're leaving your wife's perspective out of this. You;re making passive-aggressive statements like \"I should have just pushed my ex-s passing aside and went to the party\""]}
