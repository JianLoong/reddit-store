They put me down on every occasion they get. Subtle taunts to my girlfriend \u201cyou could\u2019ve gotten someone from same profession\u201d. Smoking in my face knowing I hate smokers. I also made their daughter(my gf) quit and they hate me for it coz \u201cthat\u2019s how they bond\u201d. They think I control her because I made her quit. I didn\u2019t force it upon her, I just told her I am not comfortable moving in with a smoker and she quit at the start of our relationship. Their usual bonding time is barbecue nights on sundays while smoking sheesha and other stuff.\n\nWe\u2019ve had many arguments until I decided it\u2019s better for me to not get involved with them. My girlfriend is not a fan of my decision.\nRecently I was invited to her sister\u2019s wedding which I refused to attend. Gf was pissed and did everything to make me attend the wedding (crying, emotional blackmailing and everything in between) but I had made my mind.\n\nIt was a 3 day event and she was furious while leaving and said \u201corder food from outside, i am not obliged/responsible to look after your food\u201d\n\nNow, I can\u2019t cook. She happily cooks for both of us, i\u2019ve never asked her to. Though I am grateful for what she does, I didn\u2019t like the way she made it sound like she has been doing me a favour. I happily take over the other tasks of the house too and we are both well off financially, we have maids and can afford a cook too.\n\nI immediately told her she doesn\u2019t need to do me a favour and worry about what I\u2019ll eat, I can manage and she doesn\u2019t need to cook for me from now on if she thinks like that. We had a small argument and she left.\n\nShe called me a few times in the evening, probably to ask how I will manage food (i\u2019m an athlete and don\u2019t eat out because of my nutritional needs). I was too pissed so I didn\u2019t pick up any calls.\n\nMeanwhile, I got a chef to cook and she was great. I hired her full time so we don\u2019t have this argument again.\n\n3 days later when my girlfriend came home, she immediately got furious on how I can get a chef when I know she so lovingly cooks for us. And just because she was rude in the moment and implied she didn\u2019t oblige cooking, she didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nI told her I\u2019m not letting the chef go and chef can cook for both of us if she wants, and if she doesn\u2019t, let her cook for me. She was hell bent on firing her and I told her she can\u2019t because it was hard to find a good chef who understands my nutritional needs and the kind of food I eat. I told her if she fires her I\u2019m not eating until I find another chef and that now there is no chance I\u2019ll eat what she (my gf) cooks.\n\nIt\u2019s been a day, we aren\u2019t talking.
