We both love each other a lot except I don\u2019t get along with her family.\n\nHer family doesn\u2019t like me but still invite me on occasions  because of my girlfriend. They put me down on every occasion they get. Subtle taunts to my girlfriend \u201cyou could\u2019ve gotten someone from same profession\u201d. Smoking in my face knowing I hate smokers. I also made their daughter(my gf) quit and they hate me for it coz \u201cthat\u2019s how they bond\u201d. They think I control her because I made her quit. I didn\u2019t force it upon her, I just told her I am not comfortable moving in with a smoker and she quit at the start of our relationship. Their usual bonding time is barbecue nights on sundays while smoking sheesha and other stuff.\n\nWe\u2019ve had many arguments until I decided it\u2019s better for me to not get involved with them. My girlfriend is not a fan of my decision.\nRecently I was invited to her sister\u2019s wedding which I refused to attend. Gf was pissed and did everything to make me attend the wedding (crying, emotional blackmailing and everything in between) but I had made my mind.\n\nIt was a 3 day event and she was furious while leaving and said \u201corder food from outside, i am not obliged/responsible to look after your food\u201d\n\nNow, I can\u2019t cook. She happily cooks for both of us, i\u2019ve never asked her to. Though I am grateful for what she does, I didn\u2019t like the way she made it sound like she has been doing me a favour. I happily take over the other tasks of the house too and we are both well off financially, we have maids and can afford a cook too.\n\nI immediately told her she doesn\u2019t need to do me a favour and worry about what I\u2019ll eat, I can manage and she doesn\u2019t need to cook for me from now on if she thinks like that. We had a small argument and she left.\n\nShe called me a few times in the evening, probably to ask how I will manage food (i\u2019m an athlete and don\u2019t eat out because of my nutritional needs). I was too pissed so I didn\u2019t pick up any calls.\n\nMeanwhile, I got a chef to cook and she was great. I hired her full time so we don\u2019t have this argument again.\n\n3 days later when my girlfriend came home, she immediately got furious on how I can get a chef when I know she so lovingly cooks for us. And just because she was rude in the moment and implied she didn\u2019t oblige cooking, she didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nI told her I\u2019m not letting the chef go and chef can cook for both of us if she wants, and if she doesn\u2019t, let her cook for me. She was hell bent on firing her and I told her she can\u2019t because it was hard to find a good chef who understands my nutritional needs and the kind of food I eat. I told her if she fires her I\u2019m not eating until I find another chef and that now there is no chance I\u2019ll eat what she (my gf) cooks.\n\nIt\u2019s been a day, we aren\u2019t talking. Her friends have told me I overreacted to a small argument and I shouldn\u2019t have gotten a chef.

It sounds like you do what you want with no empathy for her, or eaven believing het feelings are real. \n\nCooking takes a lot of thought and work especially if you're the only one doing it, and as a partner having no appreciation for that...

N T A for hiring a chef, YTA for doing it out of petty revenge for a petty comment your GF made when she was upset, and for doubling down later.", "Major AH, this post is all about you and all about how she has offended you. Your relationship seems very one-sided. IMO YTA", "YTA in general because you sound like you enjoy punishing her and won't compromise. I don't think hiring the chef was wrong, but why you did it was. Do you even like her?", "Honestly you both sound exhausting. Be an adult and learn to cook.", "YTA. Not for hiring the chef, but you sound controlling with \"my way or the highway\" attitude.", "YTA, how old are you?

Because it sounds like this chef is in your shared home and she should have a say over who's there or not. But she also shouldn't have threatened to not cook for you if she was just doing it to get a rise out of you (as if you're professional athlete eating right is incredibly important to your livelihood). \n\nI know this is just a snapshot of your relationship, and I'm assuming you actually enjoy this relationship, but this seems toxic as hell.", "YTA, there is no excuse for being an adult and not knowing how to cook, it's a life skill!

You said your girlfriend is the only one that can cook, what happens if she is sick having a plan b is always better. It also makes meals less awkward if you got into a fight. Instead of her angrily cooking the chef could cook for both of you.", "Oh what burdens the rich must deal with. Le sigh. ESH.", "YTA - PLEASE DON'T PROCREATE!!

TBH though, this doesn't sound like some great love story.", "Sorry but yes you are TA. Your gf sounds lovely and considerate. Put up with her family because she loves you.", "The first four paragraphs of your post are completely unnecessary. We don\u2019t need to know all of the family drama and what not.

Drama for the sake of drama, it sounds like literally nothing happened. Your reaction is literally insane and you are clearly insufferably stubborn. Like, old man set in his ways levels of stubborn. And petty bickering about whether not to hire a chef is just hilarious \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, family IS important.
