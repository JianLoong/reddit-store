I can understand needing a break from time to time but if it is all the time it is a no no. I am sure yourself will appreciate at some point a small break particularly if the kid has had a bad night, you are feeling unwell or you need some special time. The 7f should be fine watching TV/play by herself as long as she knows where the grown ups are if she needs help. It is important for kids to know how to entertain themselves (well a balance as to be struck obviously) but the 2m no, he is too young. Next time go and knock on the bedroom door and get dad/mum to look after their own kids.", "NTA send the kids upstairs to wake up their dad. Make it a game to see which one can get him out of bed. Your husband is an AH for not helping you!", "NTA a great deal of this is husband problem. Easy for him to agree when it means usually roping you in, even indirectly. Even when you said no, you were still the one doing stuff at home he should\u2019ve been helping with \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re 3 months postpartum (assuming here) ffs. Part of being a functioning adult is knowing how to say no. Now that he\u2019s a father, he especially needs to learn. Dump the children off with their parents.", "NTA -  But you literally moved into the back yard.  Don't expect this issue to be resolved until the kids are 18.  This is not about family, it's about your husband not having a spine and dumping everything on you.", "I agree that if the parents are not in the room actively looking after the children and grandpa is in charge but has to leave your husband needs to listen to his wise father and take the kid's upstairs, open the door and announce to his brother,\"Hey bro wake up! Grandpa's outside and can't watch your  kids. They have eaten. I have to go home and watch own kid and help my wife. You are in charge of your own kids. Bye!!!\" Start setting those boundaries now since you live so close and have not stopped BIL or SIL from taking advantage of your kindness. You can have him tell SIl the same thing, \"Hey SiL get off your phone. I have things to do. Your are in charge of your kids. Here they are. Bye!!!\" If she asks can her kids come and help you the answer is No. No is a complete sentence. Y'all have a new baby to bond with don't welcome unneeded stress. Op teach your husband he can still help his family by letting them parent their own children again while he learns to parent your new little blessing with you as a united team..", "NTA but you have a husband problem because he has no spine. Tell him to go wake up the kids father or, better yet, take them to him. Tell him you are leaving so he has to watch his kids.", "That is how I see it too. I feel if the roles were reversed and I asked them to watch our child. They wouldn't do it.\nMy husband has a small family with just his parents and brother and his family.\nI don't really want to spend time with them though. They are terrors and are quite mean.", "Sadly we just built our house. I have no issues saying no, but even though I tell my husband to, he never does. I know in some cases it makes him sweet, but I know they are taking advantage and he doesn't see it because they are family.", "There is always a next time. It happens every time we are with them or they are over at the grandparents place. Their father is self employed, but works all the time (probably cause he doesn't want to take care of his kids and his wife doesn't do anything household wise).", "Someone else mentioned something similar. The grandpa told them to go upstairs when his company is there, but I guess my husband superceded this when he decided to stay with them. Even now the two kids are playing outside alone. Their grandpa is sitting in the house and no issues.", "I am pretty sure there is something mentally wrong in his health. He is unhappy with how little his wife does and they go to therapy for it. \nI think that is why my husband wants to help, but that just pushes our responsibilities back.\n\nThat is a good point. Seeing how she is, though, I wouldn't trust her with my daughter. I know she has some growing up to do before she would be able to babysit. I just can't get myself to spend time with her anymore. When I tried to and we would play games; she always had to win but I wouldn't always let her and she would throw a tantrum. When we would play with dolls, she always told me what to say or do. After a while of that I stopped playing with her.", "Then you are stuck in that dynamic I'm afraid. \nHe will say yes every time and you will (probably) end up burdened with the actual childcare. \nThe fact that he was annoyed you left him with the kids while you went home to clear up (!!!) Is very telling... you have a husband problem there.", "Yes, but this was your response when hubby said he didn't want to leave them alone. You were fine with leaving a two y/o alone.", "My sibling used to cheat at Go Fish with her babysitter. And my own kids used to dictate stories for me to write. Both are seen,  by developmental psychologists as ways by which young children learn to control their environment,  i.e. to develop their own agency. What you're describing is rather common.", "I know we are and I know he will. The grandparents used to say yes every time too, but since they went on vacation with them my MIL has stopped saying yes and my FIL is slowly getting to the point as well which leaves only my husband.\n\nI would have stayed had we not had things to do, but we are pretty busy right now and I have my own little one to take care of.", "Yes, with his sister. The two almost three year old follows his sister everywhere. I know this isn't a justification and we could have brought them upstairs, but I still don't see how that is my responsibility when their dad knows we have to be out at the end of the month and have things to take care of.", "The kids have a fully functioning father just up the stairs. They weren't being left alone. OP's husband just didn't want to bother the dad to come take care of his own kids. \n\nOP, you need to sit your spouse down NOW and ask him whether he will continue to prioritize his brother's kids over his own family. I love my niece and my nephew, but my kiddo comes first. \n\nNTA", "I am all for that, but when she tell me things like \"tell your doll to tell mine this and that\" or \"go over there and wait for my doll to do this thing and then say this\". At that point she could just play by herself.\n\nAs far as games go. I let her win every now and then, but HAVING to win or else she gets upset and starts crying is not ok. She should also learn that losing happens and it is ok.", "Actually, you need to have a proper come-to-Jesus talk with your husband, where you lay down your boundaries very clearly. As in, if he says yes to minding his brother's children, he is not allowed to pawn them over on you. He says yes, he does the work. In fact, you will leave the premises (with your child, if applicable) if he does, and go to a cafe, or a park or whatever. He doesn't get to voluntell you to watch kids whose parent is in the same house as the kids. That's simply not on. Add in some words on how you will not accept his brother's behavior from him - he will never be babysitting his own kid, he will properly parent them, and not expect his parents to watch them if he is there.\n\nAnd then, and here's the main point, you stick to it. You do not make your husband's life easier if he chooses to make it complicated for himself. Nevermind what they say about marriage being a partnership - that doesn't apply when a partner is a doormat and want their other partner to be a doormat with them.", "Get ready, because this is a developmental part of childhood and a lot of kids play like this between the ages of 3 and 7. It's likely your kid will be the same for a while. It's why they recommend playing cooperative games etc and no 'winners/losers' types games til kids are over 7. \n\nThis kid old will grow out of it, they go through phases over and over and then they grow out of it and start the next one. She'll be very different by the time she's babysitting.", "NTA. The fix for that day would be. Take the kids upstairs and put them in the BILs room. He can wake up and take care of the kids. Instead of letting it slide. Start calling them out tell them the kids needs this or that. Make them do the parenting.", "Nta. Tell your husband to grow a spine.", "NTA. Why couldn't you take the kids to thru father and leave them in the room with him? He was in the house and they are his kids. It is f9mpletely unreasonable for you or your husband to stay and watch them.", "NTA.\nWhy didn't he just take them to the bedroom where the dad was? Then just leave.", "BIL & SIL are the AH. What the hell\u2026.", "Look I was raised to have family first I can\u2019t count the amount of time my parents let family or family friends move in for months at a time. Yet what SIL and BIL are doing is taking advantage because your husband has no spine to say no there\u2019s helping and then there free child care for no good reason.", "NTA. If your husband says yes to watching then, YOU should go out (shopping, to the library, lunch with a friend, an activity with your child) and leave him stuck with their two kids. If hubby complains, tell him that \u201cyou agreed to watch them, I didn\u2019t. Learn to say No!\u201d And go do your thing. He will eventually learn.", "Yes. I saw a meme the other day that side.  \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer....unless they are family, then run.\"", "This is true. Golden advice OP , please hear it. \n\nAlso, to elaborate on a point made above, If hubs is looking after BILs kids, you can leave and do your share of the work in your home so he still has to pull his weight around your home. Statements like \u201cI can\u2019t do my share of our house work because I just spent the whole day looking after BILs kids\u2026\u201d should not be allowed to fly. I\u2019m not saying they do, but I\u2019m reading into your statements that you left him babysitting to go clean up your new place. So technically you are taking over more that your fair share of your house work and your own child\u2019s care to allow hubs time to look after his brothers kids. \n\nYour husband is not sweet. He is selfish. He is choosing to be a doormat to his brother because he does not want to have that adult conversation with his brother and establish and hold up reasonable adult boundaries. He chooses to do that rather than put the needs of his wife and child first. Definitely not sweet.", "This!!!!", "NTA.\n\nI would've pushed the kids into BIL's bedroom and said 'have fun'. They are not your responsibility!", "Nta. Not your kids, not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nThose kids have parents, and you are not they.", "NTA and it\u2019s ridiculous they are turning childcare into an entitlement. Childcare is a huge industry and people make a living by taking care of other peoples children IT IS NOT FREE. This scenario that your husband has created is setting a precedent and I\u2019m afraid your own children may come in second place to the niece and nephew. If I were you I would start coming up with things to do with your own kids for the times they ask you to watch them.", "He didn't actively say yes to watching them. He just didn't want to leave them \"alone\". I had absolutely no problem with it because this is typical BIL and SIL stuff and I wasn't having it. It isn't like they were left home alone. Their grandpa was right outside and their dad was upstairs. \n\nLater in the day when my husband left to move more stuff from old place to new, their grandpa left them outside on their own while he was inside. I know for sure that it is my husband that needs to learn to say no.", "NTA at all! Would your husband be open to couples therapy? Often, a neutral third party can be very helpful when someone can't see out of the woods they're lost in, even if they don't know they're lost. It's also wonderful for strengthening communication and closeness etc, so you might pitch it to him as help with coping with new parenthood as well if he seems hesitant.\n\nMeanwhile, you've got a baby now, so turn-about is fair play. If your husband is determined to be on baby duty, he's now on YOUR baby's duty. The moment he gets roped in, you slip away, then come back a few minutes later and suddenly need his help right NOW with the baby for something. Directly address the children and say \"Uncle needs to help your cousin; go find Mama/Dada and tell them to play with you!\" If they get sent back to you somehow, my second line of defense is a messy toy (tubs of slime from the dollar store, face paint crayons, glitter glue!) and a can of caffeinated pop, then sent back with the toy after they've almost finished the pop and the toy is half opened, with both in hand. That worked back in uni on a neighbor down the street who thought that because I babysat one neighbors kids (paid), I should also babysit hers (unpaid), at the same time since it wasn't any more work.", "Have they ever asked to watch your kid? You already have to change the diapers on your own kid and now you\u2019re expected to change their 2 year olds diapers?"]}
