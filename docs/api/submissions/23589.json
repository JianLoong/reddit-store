This wedding is happening within 5 months. Your father, who is presumably raising the 10 year old and paying for her to travel to the wedding, was not a good choice of person to confide in that you are choosing to do something that will badly hurt the kid's feelings and may affect how many people are traveling. That's really anxiety-producing *for him* and you apparently had an unstated expectation that he would just cope. \n\nYou have a right to invite or not invite whomever you like, but you owe it to the people who are committing money and time now for the big event to give them enough information to make decisions. And yes, if you leave your sister out, this may result in the people close to her sitting the event out too.", "This is how childfree weddings work. You have every right to say no to kids attending, BUT caring for their minor children is a parent's first priority.  Above attending any weddings, even the wedding of an adult child.  If you tell parents they cannot bring their children, you need to be ready to be understanding if parents decline your invitation because caring for their kid comes first.\n\nThis is especially true of guests that will be traveling for the wedding since they will not have the option of leaving the child for the evening with their trusted support network.  They would either have to leave the child behind for the entire journey or leave the child in the hotel with a caregiver they may not trust.  Many parents will not be willing to do either, or may not have the option of the former and be uncomfortable with the latter.  So you may have to choose whether you want your parents there with your sister or not at all.  If they aren't comfortable leaving her, and if you can't trust your 17 year old cousin at the reception I think it's fair that others may not trust them enough to leave their kids with them in a strange city, then caring for her comes first.\n\nAlso, your concerns about her crying and ruining things?  She's 11.  Unless she has serious behavioral concerns, she's well old enough to be expected to keep it together.  She's not an infant or toddler.  \n\nNAH.  Both sides are equally valid.", "YTA. It is fairly amusing you don't trust your 17 year old cousin at your wedding but you *do* trust her for child care.\n\nPriorities.", "INFO: What exactly is the plan here?  No kids at the reception and parents figure it out for themselves, or are planning to hire your cousin to provide childcare on site in a separate space with activities, etc.?", "Kinda teetering back and forth here:\n#\nOn the one hand, you can invite whoever you want to the wedding reception and ceremony. But on the other hand, what would really be the point of going if it\u2019s just for the ceremony? Seems like a major inconvenience for the dad and kids to have to come up with a sitter (I know you said the 17yo might do it, but you also said they\u2019d cause trouble at the reception, so that might not work as well as you may think.)\n#\nIt just kinda seems like a wasted trip logistics wise for the family if it\u2019s just for the ceremony? But then again, if it\u2019s going to be troublesome at the reception it\u2019s going to be hard on your special day that you want to remember the rest of your life.\n#\nCould there be some sort of compromise? Like, what if the kids are to be highly supervised and have to leave by x amount of hours? That might work?\n#\nTough situation though. Hope it all works out!", "It's your wedding if you and your partner want a child free affair, it's your prerogative. However, I think it's cold hearted not to invite your sister.

Falling to pieces over the reality of those decisions is an indicator that you're not ready to make them.  Are you?", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou want these children at the wedding, but you want them to magically disappear for the reception? That's a bit naive. Especially considering that it sounds like your family is traveling in from another town. You need to help organize solutions or expect to have pissed-off relatives. Expecting your 17 year old cousin to watch every kid in your family is not a good solution.", "Look I get child free weddings, and that\u2019s your perogative however, people with children may not be able to attend, and that includes your parents if you don\u2019t include your sister.

But there\u2019s a bunch of little factors that have added up here and it pushed you into AH territory..\n\n- you haven\u2019t actually asked the 17 year old to babysit, you just assume they will want to \n- you also don\u2019t trust them not to sneak drinks but \u2026 child care is cool?\n- your wedding is 5 months way and people have already booked travel \n- you haven\u2019t even told anyone hay children aren\u2019t invited except your dad in secret \n\n\n\n\n*N A H - it\u2019s your wedding so you get to decide the guest list. You may lean AH for assuming the 17 year old can babysit and not asking first though, but overall your choice.*\n\n*But, I can understand how other family members may be upset. You\u2019re asking family to travel, and find childcare. That can be a lot and they\u2019ll need to figure stuff out including maybe some not attending.*\n\n#Edit - updated judgment.", "Massive YTA. Really. \n\nYou don't want your little sister at your wedding. Do you hate this kid or something? \n\nIt should be a special moment with your family, yet you'd rather have your younger sister left out because you're afraid she'd mess up your flower arrangements or something... Insane.", "Childfree weddings come with parents who decline to come because they can\u2019t bring their child. That is just something you have to expect when you ban kids. \n\nYou also OWE your guests the knowledge that their children are not invited to the reception. Why is this a secret? You\u2019re 5 months out, they need to know in case they want to make their own sitter arrangements and/or simply not come. You also don\u2019t LITERALLY know the 17yo will babysit. You\u2019re assuming. What is your plan in 17yo cannot or will not babysit?\n\nN T A for the guest list, but YTA for how you\u2019ve handled all of this.", "Oof", "Welcome to the hosting of a child-free wedding, where sometimes saying \"no kids\" will mean that other people say \"can't make it.\"\n\nThey are naturally leery of your 17 year old boozadillo troublemaking cousin being a babysitter for your sister. Other childcare arrangements would also be challenging when this wedding is almost certainly going to involve at least an overnight stay and IDK what their financial arrangements are like or if that's even doable.  YWBTA if you don't accept the consequences of your choices... which may well mean you get only one parent at your wedding.", "YTA.  You can invite or not invite whoever, and they can react however they want.  You're a bit naive for thinking this would go over smoothly.  Inviting kids to the boring part only is for your benefit and not theirs.  I don't blame parents for not wanting to go.  And stating that your cousin can be trusted to babysit but can't be trusted to attend the reception is what pushed me from N A H to YTA.  \"Hey, I don't trust you enough to let you attend the party, here, watch the other kids instead.\"", "NAH but you're a little bit of T A for trying to \"hide\" this from everyone for so long because of your anxiety. The more time people have to prepare childcare and whatnot, the better, as well as for the kids to manage their expectations. Waiting longer to spring this on people would've been a bad move, so at least it seems like your dad is right about that.", "NTA\n\nEven though I'm deeply against child-free weddings, it is your wedding and your decision.\n\nYou should have at least spoken to the 17yo who is supposed to babysit to see if she's ok with that before you make any other decisions.\n\nWhen people have child-free weddings they need to be ready for other people not showing up (maybe they don't want to have a 17yo that would bring booze babysitting their children). People who decide not to come aren't AH neither.\n\nHowever, in this case, your father betrayed your trust and that's why I didn't go with n a h\n\nETA: you need to rip the bandage off. People are entitled to know they're not supposed to have their kids with them BEFORE they make any travel arrangements, take time off from work, etc.", "I think your reasons are valid enough, if you don't want kids at the reception/party fair enough, if there is a sitter available within the family even better. I also read down there that your sister has a biting problem and is not well behaved, I would decide the same in that situation OP. It is not cold in any way, some occasions and places are not child-friendly and that's that.\n\nAnyways good luck sounds like you have a long battle ahead of you. My friend had basically the same issue, being in her early twenties with mostly child-free guests and not being too fond of children at the time in general, much less at her kinda party-like wedding reception, she fought with her mother very hard about her 8yo sister not being the exception to the child-free rule. In the end her mother attended the ceremony only and was a bit grumpy the whole time, but rest of the evening my friend and her husband had a blast with everyone, so she would definitely say it was worth it.\n\nEdit> NTA", "NTA it's your wedding but deciding this be prepared your anxiety isn't going too go away any time soon.", "NTA.  You don't want anyone under 18. Period. Family included. Weddings are boring for kids. They act up,  try to get attention. Doesn't matter if they're cousins or sisters. If people don't want to attend because of it, they can send their regrets and you need to accept it. \n\nYou will always regret inviting people just to \"keep the peace\" or \"because they're family\".", "I'm not getting into the marriage stuff--I'm going to answer your real question.  Is it okay for me to be the center of attention for the first time in 11 years?  Yes, Op, it is. NTA.  Anyone who doesn't understand the loving madness that is being related to a differently (atypically)abled person isn't trying.  You love her, but it's hard to watch your wedding become like every other even in your life since you were a teenager--her event.  NTA and give yourself two hugs today.", "NTA it is your wedding and if you want it to be childfree that can mean all kids or your can make exceptions.  But I would honestly make an exception for your sister since that she is immediate family but not the cousins as they are not.
