This wedding is happening within 5 months. Your father, who is presumably raising the 10 year old and paying for her to travel to the wedding, was not a good choice of person to confide in that you are choosing to do something that will badly hurt the kid's feelings and may affect how many people are traveling. That's really anxiety-producing *for him* and you apparently had an unstated expectation that he would just cope. \n\nYou have a right to invite or not invite whomever you like, but you owe it to the people who are committing money and time now for the big event to give them enough information to make decisions. And yes, if you leave your sister out, this may result in the people close to her sitting the event out too.", "This is how childfree weddings work. You have every right to say no to kids attending, BUT caring for their minor children is a parent's first priority.  Above attending any weddings, even the wedding of an adult child.  If you tell parents they cannot bring their children, you need to be ready to be understanding if parents decline your invitation because caring for their kid comes first.\n\nThis is especially true of guests that will be traveling for the wedding since they will not have the option of leaving the child for the evening with their trusted support network.  They would either have to leave the child behind for the entire journey or leave the child in the hotel with a caregiver they may not trust.  Many parents will not be willing to do either, or may not have the option of the former and be uncomfortable with the latter.  So you may have to choose whether you want your parents there with your sister or not at all.  If they aren't comfortable leaving her, and if you can't trust your 17 year old cousin at the reception I think it's fair that others may not trust them enough to leave their kids with them in a strange city, then caring for her comes first.\n\nAlso, your concerns about her crying and ruining things?  She's 11.  Unless she has serious behavioral concerns, she's well old enough to be expected to keep it together.  She's not an infant or toddler.  \n\nNAH.  Both sides are equally valid.", "YTA.

YWBTA if you don't accept the consequences of your choices... which may well mean you get only one parent at your wedding.", "YTA.  You can invite or not invite whoever, and they can react however they want.  You're a bit naive for thinking this would go over smoothly.  Inviting kids to the boring part only is for your benefit and not theirs.  I don't blame parents for not wanting to go.  And stating that your cousin can be trusted to babysit but can't be trusted to attend the reception is what pushed me from N A H to YTA.  \"Hey, I don't trust you enough to let you attend the party, here, watch the other kids instead.\"", "NAH but you're a little bit of T A for trying to \"hide\" this from everyone for so long because of your anxiety.

I also read down there that your sister has a biting problem and is not well behaved, I would decide the same in that situation OP. It is not cold in any way, some occasions and places are not child-friendly and that's that.\n\nAnyways good luck sounds like you have a long battle ahead of you. My friend had basically the same issue, being in her early twenties with mostly child-free guests and not being too fond of children at the time in general, much less at her kinda party-like wedding reception, she fought with her mother very hard about her 8yo sister not being the exception to the child-free rule. In the end her mother attended the ceremony only and was a bit grumpy the whole time, but rest of the evening my friend and her husband had a blast with everyone, so she would definitely say it was worth it.\n\nEdit> NTA", "NTA it's your wedding but deciding this be prepared your anxiety isn't going too go away any time soon.", "NTA.  You don't want anyone under 18. Period. Family included. Weddings are boring for kids. They act up,  try to get attention. Doesn't matter if they're cousins or sisters.
