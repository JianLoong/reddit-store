My soon to be husband has a sister let\u2019s call her Mia. Now Mia and I do not click very well. I am polite but I wouldn\u2019t say we are friends. I felt I was forced by his family to make her a bridesmaid or she will be sad. \n\nI am going to be blunt, Mia is fat and very insecure about it. This has led bridesmaid dresses shopping to be a nightmare. Never could find something she wants and all the other bridesmaid and me liking it. So I gave everyone two options to vote on. Option one was getting a dress that can be styled multiple ways, or picking from a collection so everyone matches but they will need to pay for it. Option two was I will buy everyone\u2019s dress but what I chose the dress and my decision is final.\n\nMy five bridesmaids voted and options two won. So I picked out a blue strapless dress with a mini slit. I really like it and I knew Mia would have an issue with it. I sent a picture to all the bridesmaid and confirming the right size before I ordered it.\n\nThis is where it blew up. Mia was pissed I picked a revealing dress.  This resulted in an argument where she thinks I am a huge jerk and I told her she can step down if she has issues with the dress.\n\nShe tried to get the family on her side but everyone knows I gave them options and had watched me struggle to find something everyone wants.\n\nEdit: she voted for the option where I pay for the dress. I truly didn\u2019t ask her since her and MIL announced she was one of my bridesmaid at a family gathering. The only way to keep peace with the whole family was basically giving her what she wanted.\n\nI also have gone to 4 different shops to find a dress for everyone.", "created_utc": 1704210375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wsee9/aita_for_picking_a_revealingbridesmaid_dress_in/", "score": 6364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The ah here is MIL and Mia.  MIL for announcing Mia is bridesmaid, Mia for being difficult.  I\u2019m fat and if I don\u2019t fit the same dress as everyone else, I\u2019d have voted for buying my own from a collection. Mia could still ask for this IF you are willing to compromise, again. Your fianc\u00e9e has your back. Sometimes the bridesmaids wear a dress they wouldn\u2019t have pick out because they respect the bride\u2019s choice.", "NTA\n\n>Option one was getting a dress that can be styled multiple ways, or picking from a collection so everyone matches but they will need to pay for it.\n\n>Option two was I will buy everyone\u2019s dress but what I chose the dress and my decision is final.\n\n>*My five bridesmaids voted and options two won*. \n\n>So I picked out a blue strapless dress with a mini slit.

Her participation in your wedding is optional, one could say undesired. \n\n\nEveryone knows by now it is typical for a bride to chose how she'd like her bridesmaids to appear. Mia doesn't get to override the preference of everyone else simply because she is insecure with her body type.", "NTA\n\nI was gonna say Y.T.A from the title, but reading the whole story I see you said that Mia also picked the option where you pay but get final say, and that MIL announced Mia as a bridesmaid without your consent and you just went along to keep the peace.\n\nThis generally seems like they want their cake and to eat it too. They want Mia to be a bridesmaid and to pick whatever dress she wants, but also to have you pay for it. That was never an option. \n\nA strapless dress with a mini slit doesn\u2019t sound all that revealing (pic maybe would help here to confirm), but even if it was, by agreeing to this option, Mia agreed to take what she got on this. It\u2019s your wedding and she can either suck it up, or drop out.\n\nI think picking it specifically because you knew she wouldn\u2019t like it makes you minorly TA, but in the end it\u2019s your wedding, she agreed to take what she got, and she can\u2019t be mad because what she got isn\u2019t her favorite. They\u2019ve already been stepping over your boundaries, so I think your pretty justified in not making special accommodations for her at this point.", "INFO: What did Mia vote for?", "NTA\n\nYou were told Mia would be a bridesmaid and put into an awkward position by your MIL & SIL\nThey ambushed you at a family gathering where they knew you would be outnumbered should you object.\n\nShe voted for you to buy the dress and she doesn\u2019t get to throw a fit now.\n\nShe can step down or deal.

I would also say you need to do a lot of probably difficult work of setting boundaries with your fMIL", "Are you sure you even want to marry into this family?", "ESH. Your MIL for trying to shoehorn Mia as a bridesmaid, and you for not having a backbone to say that you will not have Mia as a bridesmaid but would be thrilled to find a role for her elsewhere in the wedding i.e. doing a reading or something just as important.\n\nNeither of you are doing Mia any favors by coddling her instead of enforcing the crucial \"not everything is going to go your way\" lesson from the start.", "ESH. Of course the MIL is shitty for forcing Mia in but you are being passive aggressive and acting like a kid. If you didn\u2019t want Mia in the wedding then say that, don\u2019t pick a dress that you know she wouldn\u2019t like so she would step down. That is very childish. You picked the dress knowing she would have an issue with it, I would pick a dress I know all my bridesmaid would feel comfortable in. But that\u2019s the main issue, you don\u2019t see Mia as a bridesmaid because would you have picked a dress you knew the other bridesmaid were uncomfortable in? Probably not. You picked the dress knowing she would have two choices; be uncomfortable or be out as a bridesmaid. That is very shitty to do to any of your bridesmaids. Even if Mia had voted the other option, it still would\u2019ve been 4-1 and option two would\u2019ve won. You are a grown adult and this is your wedding, you should be able to properly communicate instead of agreeing just to be passive aggressive.", "ESH. Mia sounds difficult, but if you didn't want her to be a bridesmaid you just.... shouldn't have made her one. There were a million diplomatic ways to do it - \"I have a limited number of spots for bridesmaids and I want the women closest to me to fill those spots, but I am excited to have you as a guest at my wedding and to get to know you better\" would've done the job nicely. Or you could have even told her during the dress shopping process that her refusal to agree on anything was making things difficult and it may be better if she just attended as a guest and could then wear what she wants. Your approach, however, is pretty passive aggressive.", "NTA. Mia and MIL are making the bad choices, not you.", "WAIT.....she declared herself a bridesmaid, without being asked / invited to be one, and then turned dress shopping into a multi-expedition nightmare because she didn't like anything and everyone else was supposed to wear what SHE liked, not you...the bride...nor the other bridesmaids....\n\nMy response to the subject line was...yeah.   then I read the post and nope!  NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to high jack your wedding to be all about her.\n\nAnd strapless with a short slit is not all that revealing.  A strapless column with a high slit maybe, but that's not how you described it.", "NTA. Mia voted for the wrong thing after inviting herself to be a bridesmaid. And she seems to be the only person who thinks she can't wear a strapless dress. The funny thing is she could still be a bridesmaid if she got over herself", "Was ready to go the other way but I think NTA. I mean calling her fat is a tad mean and shouldn\u2019t be a factor, however, you have given loads of options, you tried to accommodate, you\u2019ve been to many shops, and most of all - she was forced into your wedding. Like, you can\u2019t bend over backwards any more for one person out of five especially if she herself voted for you to pick and pay for the dress.", "NTA. Best option would\u2019ve been just to put your foot down from the very start and say that you, as bride, are the only one who gets a say in who you would like as your bridesmaids. \n\nGiven that that ship has sailed, you did what you had to. Sounds like no matter what you did, they would\u2019ve either ended up mad at you, or causing issues with your wedding. This was a situation you can\u2019t win. You in-laws are a family of bullies, so best get used to standing firm and not letting them steamroll every decision you and your husband make. Such as the topic of kids - because MIL *WILL* try to run that one too\u2026", "NTA.  You\u2019d better watch MIL - her just announcing that your SIL would be a bridesmaid without even asking you first is more than audacious & quite horrible.  If you don\u2019t want that sort of thing to be repeated for the rest of your life, you\u2019d better set boundaries fast & enforce them without fail.", "ESH. You shouldn't have been pressured to make her a bridesmaid, but you'd have been better off never making the offer to begin with. Now you've made her feel worse about herself in the hopes that she would drop out. This will do absolutely nothing for your relationship with her, or your future in laws, all because you think bridesmaids are props for you to dress up for pretty photos. Why would you only agree to pay for something to do with YOUR wedding if they didn't get a say in what they wear? You should have always been paying for their dresses, because you want them to match. I'd have just let them pick their own in the same colour and been done with it. \n\nPeople over here ruining personal relationships over one day of their lives. Ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m on the heavy side and was the MOH at my sister\u2019s wedding. The dress that was selected looked great on all the other girls but I felt like I looked big in it. But you know what? It wasn\u2019t my call. The bride liked it and I wore it and smiled. Mia has main character syndrome. Sorry but if you\u2019re ultra insecure about your body, you can\u2019t force others to accommodate for everything.", "NTA. \n\nSeems like she wants her cake and to eat it. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, if she doesn\u2019t want to be in it she can just back out.", "NTA", "\"I told her she can step down if she has issues with the dress.\"\n\nAgreed.  Going with NTA.", "NTA.  You're supposed to pick your own bridesmaids, this is what she gets for trying to force it - having someone you don't like as a bridesmaid seems like a nonstarter to me.  \n\nGiven how they're acting I might just decide to elope instead (or maybe \"elope\" with your family and have a separate, scaled down event for his).", "Well I'm confused cause in the title you say you did it so Mia can drop and then you say you chose it cause it worked for the best for the majority of the people. I will say NTA to the version where you chose it because it worked for the best for the majority of the people but if you didn't want her no one could force you to have her as a bridesmaid. You're the bride so the decision should have been yours.", "I think that you need to be more honest with your MIL and the rest of your OH\u2019s family.  Getting married, unfortunately or fortunately, means they are in your life for as long as you are married.  Start as you mean to go on by being clear on your boundaries.\n\nYou should get to choose your bridesmaids, but I think the revealing outfit choice was bitchy and juvenile.  It would be far more diplomatic to stand her down as a bridesmaid and give her another \u201crole\u201d in the proceedings, one you can keep an eye on and that she feels is meaningful.", "NTA. You picked out your Bridesmaids dresses and you paid for them.\n\nYou even gave the Bridesmaids a vote on what to do for the dresses and they unanimously voted for you to pick out the dress and you pay.\n\nBecause mia was pissed off over the dress and has made the whole process difficult.\nYou should talk to your fiance & mia and formally announce that she is no longer a Bridesmaid.", "I once went to a wedding where the sister of the bride was inserted into a starring role so that she wouldn't feel left out. She sang a solo of Ave Maria while the bride and groom went to sign the register in the vestry. Her voice did not have the range to do the song justice. I still cringe at the memory.", "It's YOUR wedding why didn't you choose YOUR bridal party based on YOUR wants? You purposefully excluded this fat woman because you don't like her and don't want her to be part of your party. You have a nice shield to hide behind, insofar as the voting is concerned, but the way you worded this tells us that the revealing dress that all the skinny bridesmaids voted on was a literal trap because you KNEW the fat girl wouldn't like it.\n\nIf your fat bridesmaid had been your ACTUAL friend instead of someone you felt FORCED into your bridal party I'm pretty sure you would have chosen an assortment of inclusively pretty dresses for your team to vote on and simply moved on. Like, the revealing option probably wouldn't have even been there to be voted on. You planned it. Its very obvious you planned it. You worked hard to get everyone to agree but you only *looked* like you were giving them options because you were *reasonably* certain that everyone would outvote the fat girl and pick the sexy dress she would feel like a whale in. You knew her weakness, exploited it, and are now hiding behind a smokescreen of this falsely fair vote. It WASN'T fair. You planned it to EXCLUDE HER AND ITS WORKING.\n\nYou pulled a **HIGHLY SPECIALIZED FEMALE VERSION OF CRUELTY.** You have a lot of **excuses** to fall back on to make it **look** like you aren't targeting this woman but you are. and you're doing it because you felt pressured into putting her into your bridal party when you didn't want to. She is rightfully angry or hurt. Fat women experience what you're doing all the time. If you truly wanted her in your party it would have felt better for her to be there. You didn't so it doesn't. **You were mean to her because you felt like someone was mean to you and you literally passed the meanness along.**\n\nYou're about to be a married woman. Grow a spine, learn to tell people no, and stop bullying fat women. Also. Get control of you overbearing MIL now. She needs to know she cant control you. You did not handle this with dignity and that's what happens when you can't say no. You have to deal with these people the rest of your life.", "This smells strongly of YTA, with a whiff of smug gaslighting.\n\nOk. You didn't want her in the wedding party, and you feel she was dumped on you.  You don't even like her, from the sound of it. And you look down your nose at her, if for no other reason, she's fat.\n\nThis unanimous decision for the dress option also has an odor. Because if four people vote for Opt. Two, the last, very self conscious, person may well just say sure. A) because it doesn't matter she's outvoted, and B) because to vote the other way will highlight the reason for her self consciousness, making it worse.\n\nYou picked a dress knowing that she would not be comfortable wearing it, and were quick to tell her, \"well, if you don't like it, you can just bugger right off, then\".  \n\nThat would have solved your problem, right?

Nothing to do with me.\"\n\nAnd you want us to believe that, too.\n\nI've been a bridesmaid twice (well, once and the other as a groomsmaid), and both times the principals chose options that would not leave the wedding party uncomfortable, in a bind, or stuck with a pricey dress that could never be reused. \n\nYour wedding is one day.

OP picked a dress SHE LIKED, and if Mia didn't like the dress and would bow out gracefully then that's a cherry on top, but OPs priority was not getting Mia out, it was finalizing a dress that she wanted her party to wear (that she is paying for herself!). Mia's insecurities are things she needs to come to terms with herself, anyone who goes to 4 different bridal stores to try to accommodate those insecurities has already tried to compromise. \n\nSetting boundaries means enforcing them, and navigating new familial relationships means choosing which battles to fight, when, and how to fight them. Direct communication only works on direct and reasonable people, and if that is your only tool then you have not adulted with enough adults to know they come in many communication forms, nor learned enough other adult navigating tools. \n\nIf Mia was herself more mature, she would not try to use OPs wedding as a chance to be a distinguished member of the event and would accept that it's just not her day to have an opinion about, then decide if being a bridesmaid (with the obligation of HELPING the bride) was the right role for herself.\n\nFor my best friends wedding, I wore a backless dress that wonderfully framed my bacne scars, but my friend is lovely and I was there to support her on her big day and busy preparations.

Passive aggressive behavior makes her TA. She should have been upfront. Plus, she's being pretty unkind about another person's insecurities.
