Went to undergrad, graduated 2 years ago and now work a stable job. \n\nMy dad and stepmom have been keeping up the maintenance/paying utilities (no rent) since they moved in and I am very appreciative and thankful for everything they have done for me and my house. I guess the problem is I feel like I am ready to take care of the house myself and live on my own in my own place. I suppose I would have to kick them out, right? \n\nI sort of brought this up to the both of them and my dad basically said he felt like I used them to get to a point where I could take care of myself and kick them to the curb. And then asked if I would give him a percentage of whatever I may get from selling my house, if and when that time came. I didnt answer straight away and told them I would have to think on it.\n\nMy step mom was upset at my response and basically said I shouldnt have to think about it and to just give them the percentage because of everything theyve sacrificed (moving into the house, paying utilities, property taxes, maintenance, etc) while I was in high school and college. \n\nLastly, my dad suggested that we sell my house to buy a bigger house and add his name to the new mortgage. I am completely against this and he doesnt like that I did not agree with his idea. \n\nI honestly dont feel like ITA because Im starting to feel like my dad thinks I owe him for doing his job as a parent. Im just ready to live on my own as an adult but I feel like they were planning on staying in my house forever.\n\nEDIT: i want to thank you all for your input!! Im in awe with your responses and I feel so much more confident in putting my foot down and voicing what I want. Being a 25 F, Im trying to find honest feedback without being taken advantage of because I clearly cant go to my family lol. \n\nWith my uncle situation, I was able to connect with a lawyer and are working out how to get some of it back (learned he gambled my moms savings that was left to me away\ud83d\ude43)\n\nI would hate to resort back to getting a lawyer for my dad and stepmom but I will keep you all updated with what happens!", "created_utc": 1697135379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176dwff/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_my_dad_and_stepmom_out/", "score": 751, "replies": ["Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without [contacting the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) for approval, including edited versions.

But, them leaving would possibly be payment enough. How have them now saved up money while living rent free? It just sounds like they're taking advantage of you and your good nature. You sound like you've got a good head on your shoulders and your trajectory in life is UP!! Proud of you for even having such a level head considering all the tomfoolery you've already experienced!! I am virtually five fiving you!! Absolutely NTA!!! Like others have said, lawyer up and don't allow them make you feel poorly about it, they are showing their true colors. So sorry you even have to go through this BS, internet stranger friend!!", "You\u2019re welcome!! Keep us updated as inquiring minds what to know how this plays out lol. Good luck too! \n\nUpdateme", "What kind of parent suggest you drop out of college? Good for you for finishing.  Lawyer if you have to against your dad - hopefully not. But then go after your uncle.", "I\u2019m so sorry. You are very young to have learned you can\u2019t always trust relatives any more than a random stranger.", "Kick your dad and stepmom out and live your life! NTA", "I was told by himself that he did! Im not sure how I could be sure though", "Exactly! He should be sitting on a pile of cash that he saved on rent all those years.", "She was a child when they moved in. You're supposed to look after your children and it's a one way generosity that's paid forward to your own children. We don't owe our parents back.", "And check with an attorney for legal paperwork that has to be done to get them to leave within 60 days.", "My mom gave her brother (my uncle) authority to control her money that was left to me due to me being a minor because she didnt trust my dad to. Money was set aside for me to go to college, take care of the house and the repairs but my uncle ended up taking everything and cut contact with me once I got to college. \n\nFunny you mentioned the water heater because that\u2019s something that definitely needs replacing. The house is getting old so I came see work needing to be done soon. But I believe the most he\u2019s done is pay for major plumbing in the past.", "He would have also had a mortgage to pay. As a homeowner, it's a lot less to pay maintenance and utilities than both of those AND a house payment (with insurance and taxes). He got off easy. Plus, he gambled her money away that was put aside for her. He's a leech.", "Hey may have paid for those things, but he got. To live there rent free, so he did benefit from the arrangement. I'd think it's a wash.", "But those repairs would have been paid from the rent that the landlord received. So, in the long run, the renter is paying for the maintenance.", "Too long. They\u2019ll use the time to damage the house", "Don\u2019t you dare give up a cent of your inheritance. What kind of father would even ask that of their child? You have a shit dad.", "Property taxes and maintenance were likely less than your child support was! And utilities have to be paid whether you rent or own!\n\nHe is just after your money. \n\nAnd the bigger house thing? Yeah, let's use your house money for a 75% down payment. We can split the mortgage and taxes 50/50, eh?! Then when you feel like living alone like an adult, YOU can move out because the house is half mine!!\n\nNope, you need to do him like your uncle. Get back what your mom left you! Others will call you greedy, but you're not. Who is greedy, the fricking adults that thought they could take your assets because mommy isn't there to protect you from them. They are disrespecting you and your mom!! \n\n25 is a great age to finally get a good grip on your life. \n\nI would give them 3 months to find a new place to live. If they have not signed a lease, or went into escrow on a house to buy, I would evict them. Better to have them pissed and gone, thsn to be pissed yourself, and have to live with them!\n\nAnd when they say they \"can't afford\" it, remind them they have lived for 8 years with very little bills because of you. If they were not smart enough to save money, nothing you do to help is going to put them in a position where ther are getting ahead. Don't let that make you fall behind!\n\nThey have become freeloaders!", "Never ever sell your house to put money together to buy one with them. \nDon\u2019t allow them to manipulate and gaslight you. Lawyer up and kick them out. \nInstall security cameras in and outside your house.", "And the proof? NTA  do NOT give him anything and only allow a couple of months for them to move out. They had years to save money when they paid 0 rent .", "Bank records gotten through lawyer. If he was paying it to who was he paying it. You'd also probably need to find divorce agreement to see if he was paying right amount.", "Tell him to prove it. Look up human services and ask who you would talk to about the issue.", "That, too.", "God, your uncle is just as bad! I would consider looking into pursuing action against him as well when you consult a lawyer.", "Op you need an attorney.", ">my uncle ended up taking everything and cut contact with me once I got to college.\n\nWhat? Did you get a lawyer? Is everyone you know an asshole?", "What a shame your uncle did that. In hindsight mom should have set it up as a trust to be paid out to you for house and living expenses with no family able to touch it. I hope you sort things out.", "Man I think you need a lawyer because that's nuts.", "It was the uncle who ran off with OPS cash inheritance, not the father.\n\nI am making a difference between capital improvements like a new roof and repairs like calling the plumber in because the drain is clogged.\n\nAs I said elsewhere, in the US, which is my only reference for this, when you sell a home, you have to pay taxes on the increase in its value based on the appreciation of it during your ownership. It's real estate. Unless you totally let the house fall down, or they discover that it is sitting on a superfund site, the house's value will go up.\n\nHowever, you can count the cost of improvements and major repairs like replacing the roof against the increase in value, and thereby lower your taxes. If OP ever sells this house, they will benefit in the form of a lower liability from these capital repairs and improvements that the father paid for.", "It really isn't. Or rather, there are two separate issues. \n\nOP couldn't live alone. So either he takes her into his home and supports her or he and his  wife going to live in the home that OP owns.\n\nWhen you sell a home in the US, you have to pay tax on the increase in value of the home over the purchase price. However, that increase in value can be offset by the cost of improvements or repairs to the home. Because the home is owned by OP, OP will get to deduct those costs from their taxes if and when they sell the home in the future. At that time they will be benefiting financially from what their father invested in the home.", "And his gf is shitty.", "They're not gaslighting her.", "Yeah. I was wondering this. Did they put anything away during all that time?", "I did!! Im working through that situation now!!", "She is young and has no real knowledge of how all the legalities work and play out. For the snakes in the grass this screams \"take advantage of me!\". I genuinely hope there is a special place in Hell for those kind of people", "Or she could have moved in with her father and either sold or rented out her house, which would have benefited her financially. Him moving into her house saved him a ton of money, even with any upgrades or repairs he may have made.\n\nAll things considered, I think dad and stepmom had a pretty sweet deal.", "They're trying to gaslight OP by making OP believe that OP owes them anything at all.", "Good luck. I hope you can recoup enough to pay your loans.", "That's great to know! Hope you get the justice you deserve!"]}
