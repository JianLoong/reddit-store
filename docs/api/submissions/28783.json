Fast forward 8 years, I am ready to live on my own. Went to undergrad, graduated 2 years ago and now work a stable job. \n\nMy dad and stepmom have been keeping up the maintenance/paying utilities (no rent) since they moved in and I am very appreciative and thankful for everything they have done for me and my house. I guess the problem is I feel like I am ready to take care of the house myself and live on my own in my own place. I suppose I would have to kick them out, right? \n\nI sort of brought this up to the both of them and my dad basically said he felt like I used them to get to a point where I could take care of myself and kick them to the curb. And then asked if I would give him a percentage of whatever I may get from selling my house, if and when that time came. I didnt answer straight away and told them I would have to think on it.\n\nMy step mom was upset at my response and basically said I shouldnt have to think about it and to just give them the percentage because of everything theyve sacrificed (moving into the house, paying utilities, property taxes, maintenance, etc) while I was in high school and college. \n\nLastly, my dad suggested that we sell my house to buy a bigger house and add his name to the new mortgage. I am completely against this and he doesnt like that I did not agree with his idea. \n\nI honestly dont feel like ITA because Im starting to feel like my dad thinks I owe him for doing his job as a parent. Im just ready to live on my own as an adult but I feel like they were planning on staying in my house forever.\n\nEDIT: i want to thank you all for your input!! Im in awe with your responses and I feel so much more confident in putting my foot down and voicing what I want. Being a 25 F, Im trying to find honest feedback without being taken advantage of because I clearly cant go to my family lol. \n\nWith my uncle situation, I was able to connect with a lawyer and are working out how to get some of it back (learned he gambled my moms savings that was left to me away\ud83d\ude43)\n\nI would hate to resort back to getting a lawyer for my dad and stepmom but I will keep you all updated with what happens!", "created_utc": 1697135379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176dwff/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_my_dad_and_stepmom_out/", "score": 1499, "replies": ["Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without [contacting the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) for approval, including edited versions.

It's real estate.

However, that increase in value can be offset by the cost of improvements or repairs to the home.

I am a CPA based in Australia and built my family's net worth by investing and developing residential property, so I've got a little bit of expertise.\n\nBased on what we pay here I am certain they are ahead by a factor of 10 or thereabouts - property taxes here (water and council rates) are about 10% of market rents. Maybe reduce that factor to 6 or 5 by the time you add electric and gas into the mix, if they were paying those.\n\nFinancially, you have done them a huge favour by letting them live with you rent-free and this strikes me as massively entitled on their part.
