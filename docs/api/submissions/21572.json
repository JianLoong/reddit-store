Both my parents know that my job doesn\u2019t pay that much and i barely make \u00a3600 a month.

They have repeatedly said that they won\u2019t ask me or expect me to pay them anything until I turn 18. However just last week they have now turned around and said that I should support them with groceries shopping as we spend a lot of money on food and my dad thinks that it\u2019s not fair that I do not pay anything and they have to pay it all even though I am still 17.  I didn\u2019t confront them about as I felt like it would cause an argument however now I\u2019m ready to speak up and when I do so they will think that I am the asshole and just don\u2019t do anything to support them.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't think it's fair to ask for money from a 17 year old child.", "NTA\n\nIt's ok for me that adult kids pay some money for the household. But you are 17 and they changed their mind quickly.\n\nYou should openly ask them, why they now want the money earlier then discussed. Maybe they have financial issues. My mom borrowed sometimes money from me for these cases.", "NTA mainly because I think the way your parents have gone about this is really shitty. I don't think that 100 quid a month towards groceries is a lot and lots of parents charge their kids a bit of board. It's not something that I would do but that's me. But they shouldn't have told you that you didn't need to pay anything and then unilaterally decide that you are paying towards groceries. Also, you might not be aware of this, but your parents can kick you out of the house if you're over 16 in the UK. I know because this happened to one of my friends on his 16th birthday. So just be careful because they're not obliged to keep you in the house.", "NTA. Your parents\u2019 money troubles aren\u2019t the problem of their minor child. But, once you turn 18, this obviously changes and if you don\u2019t want to pay your way then, get ready to look for a place on your own.", "If you\u2019re not paying for any groceries or utilities, how exactly are you \u201csustaining\u201d yourself? \n\nI mean, NTA, because your parents do have a legal responsibility to provide for you and an ethical one to keep their promises. But your claim about sustaining yourself without actually contributing to any of the expenses that sustain you smacks of a na\u00efvet\u00e9 that you should be seeking to overcome at your age.", "I do not mind paying towards the house after I turn 18, in fact I\u2019m more than happy to do so. It\u2019s the fact that they are expecting me to start so earlier than what they initially said. I do want to live at home as much as I can as it will be less expensive rather than living by myself. I just think it\u2019s unfair to do so having that I\u2019m still their child and I don\u2019t ask them for anything.", "i dont think YTA you are still under 18 and they have already promised not to make you pay. also \u00a3100 a month for groceries is way too much to be expecting you to pay by yourself. even if they can say that you eat there and dont pay anything, which is a right as you are still a child and should be cared for by your parents, \u00a3100 worth of food is not not the amount that you are likely to be eating every month", "NTA\n\nYour parents are going back on their original agreement. Reiterate to them what was agreed and if they aren't going to honour it you could call CPS and tell them your legal guardians are forcing you to pay for your rights to an upbringing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Firstly, you are NOT supporting yourself if you do not pay for groceries and utilities.  When your parents said they wouldn't ask you for money, they may have been fine but have you considered that their situation may have changed.  Times are tough everywhere.  Stop thinking about your little view of the world and try to see it from their point of view.  Just because you live at home and just because you are not 18 doesn't mean you can't contribute to the household finances.", "YTA\n\nNot the asshole for not wanting to contribute but... AN asshole for thinking it's \"a matter of principle\".\n\nEDIT: In response to all the fine legal minds...\n\nOP has been raised and supported by their parents for almost 18 years.\n\nOP works to generate \u00a3600 per month discretionary income. \n\nParents are experiencing money troubles and DO NOT have \u00a3600 per month discretionary income because they're paying all the bills and feeding OP.\n\nJudging by the units of currency, this is in the UK\n\n> Once a young person reaches 16 they can leave home, or their parents can ask them to move out. \n\nSo... contribute \u00a3100 per month for rent, food, all other bills or find somewhere else to live, feed self, pay all bills... for less than \u00a3100 per month. Good luck with that.", "EDIT-I just re read it and saw the money symbol. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the US it\u2019s illegal to charge a minor for rent/food/basic necessities.

The problem lays with my dad as he only pays for the rent and his child support to his other 2 children and that\u2019s it. Everything else like cars and all house bills are paid by my mum", "That is a fair point. Just one thing I forgot to mention was that my dad is actually my step dad and we do have a really strong relationship. My bio dad is not in the picture and doesn\u2019t contribute to anything but my step dad treats me as his own daughter. Anyway I don\u2019t mind supporting my mum in this but I think my dad is just frustrated over the fact that I don\u2019t pay anything", "So I don\u2019t pay anything towards the household expenses but I do pay for my own transport, phone bill, and othe small things like that.
