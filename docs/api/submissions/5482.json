He doesn't have children of his own, but has been a good to my boys so far. His mother also as been very involved in their lives, which I appreciate, but I think she is constantly trying to outstage me, like for example, if I do a good dinner with my boys and she happens to be in the house, if the boys say how good the food is she will say \"Oh thanks, its grandma's recipe\". This has cause some problems between us, because I always clarify that I did it, not her, and she always tries to take the credit, but my boys are smart and they can see right through her. \n\nWe also had some other problems, like when she insisted in signing them up to sunday school, but they rather practice soccer, so I sent them to soccer practices, which made her really mad. \n\nThis year has been amazing to me, got a new job with a big salary increase, so I was able to spoil my boys a little better, and overall improve our lives. During Black Friday and upcoming weeks, I bought my boys a lot of stuffs, like new laptops for school, new phones, a few shirts, shoes, and even a PS5 because I knew they will love that. I hid everything in the maintenance room at our home, and told my husband to keep the secret till xmas to surprise my kids. But a few days ago I opened it to hide a some phone cases just bought, and everything was gone. I got desperate and called my husband to ask him where everything was, he told me to calm down because everything was at his mom's house.\n\nI lost it and asked why the F the xmas gifts were at his mom's house, and he answered \"To hide it better from the kids, because they are gonna find them before the day\" I called out his bullshit because the maintenance room had a lock and I don't think they would remove a lock just for that. \n\nThen I called his mom, she confirmed everything and told me to not worry because \"I can give them back to you on xmas morning\" I told her to give everything back NOW, but she started screaming at me on the phone for not trusting her. Then I threatened to call the cops if she didn't bring them back now, to which she responded if I was in my days.\n\nI had enough, so called the cops immediately. The cops came back that afternoon with everything, except for the PS5, MIL came in with the cops. When I asked her about the console she played dumb saying \"What console?\" Since she wouldn't tell me where that was, I pressed charges, and she is still in police custody.\n\nMy husband is ANGRY, enraged at me, saying that I'm ruining his mom's live, that how could I do that to an older woman, that I should stop demonizing her when she is only trying to be a good grandma, that will never forgive me for this, and can't believe I went this nuclear for a misunderstanding. Of course with the police commotion the boys know exactly what I bought them for xmas. I'm starting to think that I ruined everything by my own. My husband is staying at a hotel near where his mom is and won't come back until she is realized.", "created_utc": 1671843063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztxjfm/aita_for_calling_the_cop_on_my_mil_after_she_hid/", "score": 1025, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Secondly, you let your anger and existing animosity with your MIL drive your reaction - and she reacted in kind.  You were justified to be angry, and she had no right to refuse to return the gifts, as they were your property. Again, your HUSBAND getting involved was a factor - I'm betting she didn't know that these were exclusively from You/Your money, and she thought she was simply helping your husband hide presents.

I hid everything in the maintenance room at our home, and told my husband to keep the secret till xmas to surprise my kids. But a few days ago I opened it to hide a some phone cases just bought, and everything was gone. I got desperate and called my husband to ask him where everything was, he told me to calm down because everything was at his mom's house.\n\nI lost it and asked why the F the xmas gifts were at his mom's house, and he answered \"To hide it better from the kids, because they are gonna find them before the day\" I called out his bullshit because the maintenance room had a lock and I don't think they would remove a lock just for that. \n\nThen I called his mom, she confirmed everything and told me to not worry because \"I can give them back to you on xmas morning\" I told her to give everything back NOW, but she started screaming at me on the phone for not trusting her. Then I threatened to call the cops if she didn't bring them back now, to which she responded if I was in my days.\n\nI had enough, so called the cops immediately.

Because that's what this was about: her being The Cool Grandma. Which, while understandable, is immature, and this is NOT the way to go about it. Grandma is off the rails but Husband, presumably a rational adult, should have shut her down gently and not enabled this disaster.\n\nAs OP has realized, the temporary satisfaction wasn't worth it.

OP's response was appropriate. The MIL should have given back the gifts as soon as she was asked. She answered no. What would have happened if OP took a breather?

It all sounds to me like she kind of blew up (understandably, considering the build up) and now the blowback falls on her kids.
