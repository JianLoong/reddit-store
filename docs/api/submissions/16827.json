Just that she's a bit overweight. Not fat, not obese; just a little overweight. For all we know, Stepniece could fit in the dress just fine, and OP's idea of her being overweight is skewed.\n\nShe doesn't even say that Stepniece is a different dress size.\n\nThere are a few models on TikTok that have been open about their image and body. One of them just posted a video about how she gained over 15 pounds and now considered 'overweight', but she's still a size four and can fit her clothes from prior to her weight gain just fine.\n\n>Why would I let her try it and potentially ruin it?

If it doesn\u2019t fit then obviously she won\u2019t be able to wear it, but you are a major AH to just say no.  You basically said she\u2019s not as \u201cworthy\u201d as your blood niece.", "YTA fatso. Based on this post and your comments I can only say that you lack not only tact but intelligence. Your fashion is nothing to marvel at if this is how you act. You\u2019re ugly - on the outside and inside. You should shrivel away in shame for being so ugly. And fat. Honestly. Hippo hips gotcha cranky huh asshole? Does Ms. Piggy want a cupcake to make her feel better and put on another 50 pounds? Oh I bet she does! You sweet little monstrous biatch.", "NTA", "NTA", "Yeah I agree on this. I\u2019ve had friends ruin clothes when I was younger because they tried to squish into them so yeah if someone is clearly bigger than me and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll fit it, I wouldn\u2019t let them now. But saying no you can\u2019t because you\u2019re overweight or it won\u2019t look good is just unnecessarily mean. I mean even different body shapes could prevent something not fitting.", "Where does OP say that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t look good on her anyways\u201d? She just says she didn\u2019t want to risk ruining the dress. Just because someone can fit into a size, doesn\u2019t mean that their body doesn\u2019t stretch the garment. \n\nI once had a roommate who always wanted to borrow my closed, and I was too embarrassed to say no, as she was bigger than me and I didn\u2019t want to imply anything about her weight. She also did wear the same size as me, but her clothes were often skin tight and fit poorly. So yea she could technically fit into my clothes, but they were stretched quite a bit and once she started moving around in them, it wore at the seams and fabric. I had several dresses and blouses ruined by her insistence on wearing my clothing. \n\nIf I had spent a ton of money on those clothes and had had a stronger spine I would have said no after the first stretched seam.\n\nEdit: ok saw the comment. Ya, I mean if OP wants to lend her niece clothing she shouldn\u2019t offer in front of someone she doesn\u2019t want to lend to. This comment tips it from reasonable caution to mean fashion girl. Gross.", "True but it doesn't matter, OP can refuse to give anyone their dress regardless of their physique. I suppose the only way they'd be the asshole is how they framed their reason for refusing to give the dress, other than that, OP owes no one their clothes.", "Wouldn\u2019t look good on her anyway?  Wow, you really are an AH.  Your brother should be ashamed to have you as a sister.", "It's in her only comment that I quoted.\n\n>Why would I let her try it and potentially ruin it? ***Also it wouldn't look good on her anyway***", "Oh, she absolutely can. But I would say it still makes her an AH if she's refusing simply because she doesn't think the girl is attractive enough for the dress and would look ugly in it.\n\nYou can be legally in the right, but morally an AH.\n\nGiven how OP is avoiding any questions asking if Stepniece is actually a different size or for clarification on the matter, and only replied to say that Stepniece would look awful in the dress; I'm inclined to believe that she's just judging the child because she doesn't fit with OP's beauty standards.\n\nIf it's really a concern of Stepniece being a completely different dress size, you'd think that that information would be in the post. There's really no reason for OP to make that dig about her Stepniece either; which paints OP in a rather rude and judgemental light.", "Ya I saw that afterwards. Woof.", "Yea. Your edit is exactly how I feel about the situation. Like, that comment is so unnecessary and the fact that she said it?? Definitely mean girl material.", "NTA. I have ripped seams of my own clothes after gaining a few pounds. \n\nWhen you allow people to borrow your things, you have to assume they could be damaged or simply not returned.
