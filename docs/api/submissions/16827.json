She also did wear the same size as me, but her clothes were often skin tight and fit poorly. So yea she could technically fit into my clothes, but they were stretched quite a bit and once she started moving around in them, it wore at the seams and fabric. I had several dresses and blouses ruined by her insistence on wearing my clothing. \n\nIf I had spent a ton of money on those clothes and had had a stronger spine I would have said no after the first stretched seam.\n\nEdit: ok saw the comment.

But I would say it still makes her an AH if she's refusing simply because she doesn't think the girl is attractive enough for the dress and would look ugly in it.\n\nYou can be legally in the right, but morally an AH.\n\nGiven how OP is avoiding any questions asking if Stepniece is actually a different size or for clarification on the matter, and only replied to say that Stepniece would look awful in the dress; I'm inclined to believe that she's just judging the child because she doesn't fit with OP's beauty standards.\n\nIf it's really a concern of Stepniece being a completely different dress size, you'd think that that information would be in the post.

OP doesn't want her clothes to be worn by someone heavier than herself so they don't get stretched. she's not fatshaming her niece on purpose. these things aren't mutually exclusive. this is a scenario where pointing out the stepnieces body type is necessary and isn't meant to be malicious...\njesussssassznsjfncjenxjcnf", "Just FYI: people who are ugly on the inside tend to be ugly in the outside.

Usually missing reasons are missing for a reason. And OP leaving out a good chunk of what actually happened and how the situation went down... Makes it suspicious about why she's doing that.", "rampant and overzealous vigilantism about body positivity and anti body shaming campaigns have brain poisoned people about how fashion and flattering clothes work. i remember when i was a teenager magazines had suggestions for clothing that suited specific body types \ud83d\ude44\n\nOP specifically stated they value their clothes, they value the quality of how they dress and it's not a reach to assume they believe in dressing to flatter body types (anyone's, not just their own)\n\nthey like fashion. they think clothes should look good on the wearer. simple as.", "I was a model myself when I was younger. I took several fashion courses in high school and college. I am well aware of how clothes look on different body types and that not every style is flattering. But again, the comment is unnecessary.
