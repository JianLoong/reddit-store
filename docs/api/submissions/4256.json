As a security guard, it is his job to provide assistance and support to people in need, and he failed to do so in this situation. It is understandable that you would be upset and frightened when your phone stopped working and you were alone in the mall, and the security guard should have offered you help and support instead of making fun of you.

He's a security guard. Part of his JOB is ensuring your safety. If he had been a custodian, his response would not seem as inappropriate, but as a security guard... WTF?\n\nIs there a landline phone at your place of employment you could have used?", "NTA. His actions were reprehensible. You feeling unsafe is the REASON security is there. Report, document, escalate. His actions are putting the mall at a severe liability. If you don\u2019t feel safe talking to security because of this and you get hurt, the mall may be liable.", "NTA. Even if you weren't visibly upset - his response to you was incredibly unprofessional and just shitty as a person.

Screw that guy and the whole security team.", "NTA.

The security guard, head of security, and the guard at your department.\n\nI'm 33 and even though I understand 18-19 year olds are adults, I always see them as children, especially if they come to me for help. It doesn't matter what I think your reaction should have been, if you came to me for help, I would never ever make fun of you for that.\n\nHowever, It is important that you learn your lesson from this. Carry your charger with you (wouldn't help if the phone itself died) and make arrangements in advance if you're planning on staying out late.\n\nFor context, if I found myself in the same situation, I could just step out and avail a bus or some other mode of public transport. If public transport is not available in your area, then it's important you have a plan B. This can either be a case where you have told your father in advance to come pick you up even if you don't call, or a backup phone you can use in emergencies.\n\nAlso, I'm surprised the mall doesn't have a phone available for use anywhere.

Explain that you were working after hours and discovered that your phone was not working correctly. You approached the first security guard for assistance and not only did he not help but he made fun of you. You had to have a second security guard help you. You felt that the first guards actions were inappropriate so you lodged a complaint against the first officer. Not only did the head of security not take your complaint seriously, the first officer harassed you about the complaint.\n\nEven if he felt that you were being a 'silly girl', the first guard should have calmed you down, maybe taken you to the security office and let you call your father or someone to come get you. And there should be a dedicated landline that people can use in cases like these- are you supposed to wait in a deserted mall while your phone charges?

No matter how hard I try, I CANNOT learn how to orient myself on roads. Out in the forest on a hike with no trail, I can navigate no problem, but roads confuse my internal compass to no end for some reason.

I started panicking, but I *thought* that *maybe* I could remember how to get back to the highway, and if I found the highway I could make it home. I got horribly lost, and I called my dad bawling like a baby, because I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly from panic that my mom has worked in that same city since before I was born. He reminded me that he didn\u2019t know the city but she did and to call her. So I called her, and I was panicking the whole time she was trying to direct me, until she finally helped me find the highway home.

In the restaurant, if one shift ended and we could not go out in a group, one of the cooks (usually a man) walked us to our car. You could see our cars from the back door of the restaurant also.

Does it suck, that as a woman you should think about what you if A or B happens? Yes, but it does help keeping you safe, and calm. \n\nMy point is that crying and panic only makes her situation worse, it points everyone to the fact how vulnerable she is right now.

The thought of having to walk home in the dark all alone as a woman is scary and a lot of women would have cried or panicked in this situation.

I learned the hard way, when I trusted someone to take me home and if I hadn't been crying and hysterical I might have been smarter.

And I am still skeptical that a 'dinner theatre' (whether theatrical plays or something like Medieval Times) hasn't got a phone. But nobody else seems to think it weird that they \"use their cell phones\" in spite of \"not being allowed to have their phones on them\" while working, but I suppose it is possible.", "It's a little too late for me to help her find a phone and get home now. All we can do is Monday morning quarterback and suggest things that she might have done differently to avoid a similar situation. I find it horribly inappropriate that a security guard wouldn't help her, but I also think that a grown woman crying and freaking out because her phone isn't charged is a little extreme.\n\nI know she says that their employer does not have a phone but that seems a little far-fetched to me and I suspect she simply didn't think about using that phone until After the fact. \n\nShe doesn't say exactly where she works but what she's describing sounds like Medieval Times, or some sort of a dinner theater. Those sorts of businesses have box offices. People call all the time to ask questions about what they can bring with them and what they can't, what time the doors open, and how to get there. The idea that the employees use their individual cell phones to conduct business when they're not allowed to have their cell phones on them during their shift is questionable. If you looked up the business on Google whose cell phone number would they publish? Would they update it every few hours to reflect the cell phone number of whoever was working that shift? \n\nI'm just concerned about the entire scenario and the way OP dealt with the problem. I never said OP was TA, and I agree the security guard was. However, OP could have done more to help herself in this situation. \n\nI'm glad to hear that her parents are concerned for her and are buying her a car, but she could have made herself a victim by making herself look vulnerable. One would like to believe one can trust a security guard, but in this case we've already seen that you can't. And whether or not it's true, there is a stereotype that many security guards are people who couldn't get positions as police officers, usually due to things in their past.\n\nI do hope OP Will keep her phone charged going forward, And maybe even invest in a backup battery, because it's much more dangerous to be stranded when your car has a flat tire, runs out of gas, or has another mechanical problem.

Like \"lets make fun of the person who needs help\"  then \"lets complain and intimidate the person I was an ass to because they got me in trouble for what I did\".  Psychologically this was a bully move and all those involved should be reprimanded in some way.

I would like to think that in this day and age, where law enforcement is seen in a negative light on social media, that even security personnel would be expected to have superior customer service.  Staff hired or contracted for security are theoretically responsible for property and employees.  Therefore OP is a customer.
