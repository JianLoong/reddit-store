You were upset, and stranded with no way of getting yourself home, and needed help. That's OK. You went to someone who should have helped, and he laughed at you. That's an AH.\n\nIt's nobody's fault that your phone broke. Shit happens. That's not why you're complaining. It is the AH guard's fault for choosing to make fun at you for being upset.", "NTA. Sounds like a bully dressed as a security guard. The fact that his boss and the other ones are sticking up for him is not good! You may have to go over his bosses head to get anything to happen. Bullies should not be in the security business!", "NTA. And DO NOT let this go. PLEASE take this up the chain.", "NTA\n\nThe security guard's actions were inappropriate and unprofessional, and he should not have made fun of you or belittled you for needing help. As a security guard, it is his job to provide assistance and support to people in need, and he failed to do so in this situation. It is understandable that you would be upset and frightened when your phone stopped working and you were alone in the mall, and the security guard should have offered you help and support instead of making fun of you. You were justified in reporting the security guard's behavior, and the head of security's response was not appropriate. You did nothing wrong in this situation, and you have every right to expect better treatment from the security guards at your workplace.", "As someone who used to work security forever ago, just know that these types of people generally have a poor outlook and when the opportunity arises they will make use of the incredibly tiny authority they have. For this person to be that much of a dick to you when they could have just as easily helped you reveals how much of an asshole they are. \n\nNTA", "NTA, as a manager I see so much liability in that! On top of the inappropriate comments he made to you.", "NTA. Fuck that guy.", "NTA. What a bunch of jerks! I cannot believe that was his boss's response to you. Know that you're being treated incredibly unfairly is there some type of higher up you could go to because honestly they are the ones who are wrong here. So sorry that happened to you because you really didn't deserve it and any boss worth a crap wouldn't have turned around and told the offending employee so they can harass you again.", "NTA. He's a security guard. Part of his JOB is ensuring you safety. If he had been a custodian, his response would not seem as inappropriate, but as a security guard... WTF?\n\nIs there a landline phone at your place of employment you could have used?", "NTA. His actions were reprehensible. You feeling unsafe is the REASON security is there. Report, document, escalate. His actions are putting the mall at a severe liability. If you don\u2019t feel safe talking to security because of this and you get hurt, the mall may be liable.", "NTA. Even if you weren't visibly upset - his response to you was incredibly unprofessional and just shitty as a person. I'm willing to bet he's no different to others so I would take this above head of security - to the mall management group itself.", "Far from it, you were and are being victimized by some very shitty people.", "NTA. Screw that guy and the whole security team.", "NTA. He's not required to loan you his own phone, but being insulting was rude and completely out of line.\n\nHe's paid to be there and assist with the mall and it's patrons. Poor customer service", "NTA His response was very unprofessional.", "NTA. Everyone who spoke to you about this is a jerk. The security guard, head of security, and the guard at your department.\n\nI'm 33 and even though I understand 18-19 year olds are adults, I always see them as children, especially if they come to me for help. It doesn't matter what I think your reaction should have been, if you came to me for help, I would never ever make fun of you for that.\n\nHowever, It is important that you learn your lesson from this. Carry your charger with you (wouldn't help if the phone itself died) and make arrangements in advance if you're planning on staying out late.\n\nFor context, if I found myself in the same situation, I could just step out and avail a bus or some other mode of public transport. If public transport is not available in your area, then it's important you have a plan B. This can either be a case where you have told your father in advance to come pick you up even if you don't call, or a backup phone you can use in emergencies.\n\nAlso, I'm surprised the mall doesn't have a phone available for use anywhere. Are you sure of this? I think all malls would have a help desk or something similar for emergencies. Do check this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I AM a security guard. This is SUPER unprofessional on ALL levels.  What the absolute fuck?\n\nNumber 1.  You need to take this up the chain.  As high as you have to to get a result.\n\nNumber 2. The guard who harassed you for crying after you broke your phone is an asshat.\n\nNumber 3.  Their supervisor broke protocol (at least they would have if they worked for my company) by telling their guard WHO complained AND by giving their guard your phone number (which, by the way, I'm not entirely sure how he got unless his supervisor gave it to him directly, which is an absolute violation of every protocol)\n\nNumber 4.  I wouldn't trust your safety alone with ANY of those guards tbh.  They all sound like assholes and like they are incapable of doing their jobs without being biased/without causing drama.\n\nNumber 5. I would complain to YOUR supervisor.  If the supervisor of the security won't listen to you, a teenage girl, they might (or might not, but it's worth a shot) listen to a complaint from YOUR supervisor about how one of their guards harassed one of their employees.\n\nThis makes me angry, and kind of makes me uncomfortable being in the same field as these types of people.\n\nEdited to add some detail", "OP should also report the security guard for calling her after she complained to his supervisor the first time. \n\nNTA.", "No we rely entirely on mobile phones & the security guards have cell phones.", "I always have a charger with me, always have a portable battery.

You do realize that 18 year olds used to be able to leave their house at night without a phone, right?", "Okay, so he already had your phone number.  But.  It's still unprofessional, and it would be breaking my companies policy, for that guard to have been informed that you complained.\n\nComplaints about specific guards are handled anonymously.   They don't tell you who complained, and they don't give you enough detail about the complaint to know the situation that led to the complaint (otherwise you could figure it out on your own pretty easily).  \n\nThis entire situation makes my skin crawl tbh.  It makes me super unhappy that people like that are allowed to be security guards.  \n\nI take pride in what I do.  I take my job seriously, and knowing people rely on me, and respect me, and feel they can trust me in an emergency (I have handled emergency situations at my site, and I got an award from my company because my site supervisor wrote in about how amazingly I handled the situation) makes me super proud, and makes me feel like I have a purpose, like it has helped me through some rough times.  \n\nI would NEVER talk to ANYONE like that.  I don't care who you are, if you are at my site, and you look panicked, or lost, or scared, my instict is to try to help you, try to fix the problem.  Not to insult you,  stress you out and make you feel like shit for things outside of your control.  \n\nIm not, in any way, implying I am perfect, or the model security guard, or that im better than everyone.  I know I have things I can improve on at my job, and I strive to meet those goals daily.   But.  \n\nThere is a basic level of respect you need to give people when you are in a position of power, like I am.  And these guards?  Are abusing their position, and their authority.  It's sickening.", "People cry when they are stressed.

Back in the day, the mall would have a public telephone that OP could have used. These days, public telephones basically don't exist, because everyone has cellphones. When people didn't rely on having a cellphone, they had plans for how to get home - they had a car, or they would plan on riding the bus, or would have an arrangement to be picked up at a certain time, or would ride with someone, or knew where the taxi stand was, or - well, you get the point.\n\nThese days, pretty much everyone's plan is \"I've got my cellphone - I'll call you for a ride / get an uber / whatever\". Which is just fine until their phone breaks.", "Nope I\u2019m the only generation that has ever been and ever will be.", "She was at work.

He might not be white. Whatever his ethnicity, he is basking in privilege he doesn't even ever have to consider. NTA. \n\nMore to the point: the security department at the mall is completely corrupt. In case they have plans to retaliate? (And do not put this past them!) Never be the last to leave work again. Always stay around others as you are waiting for your ride to show. I am sorry you have to curtail your own freedoms to keep yourself safe in this instance. Do it if the job is very much worth keeping for you. If it's not? Fuck these guys. Leave them to their escalated, fountained, cheerful plastic kingdom and their low status, dead-end jobs.", "Statistically that guy is more likely to be assaulted and murdered"]}
