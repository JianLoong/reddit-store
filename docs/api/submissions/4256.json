It is understandable that you would be upset and frightened when your phone stopped working and you were alone in the mall, and the security guard should have offered you help and support instead of making fun of you.

He's a security guard. Part of his JOB is ensuring your safety. If he had been a custodian, his response would not seem as inappropriate, but as a security guard... WTF?\n\nIs there a landline phone at your place of employment you could have used?", "NTA. His actions were reprehensible. You feeling unsafe is the REASON security is there. Report, document, escalate. His actions are putting the mall at a severe liability. If you don\u2019t feel safe talking to security because of this and you get hurt, the mall may be liable.", "NTA. Even if you weren't visibly upset - his response to you was incredibly unprofessional and just shitty as a person.

Screw that guy and the whole security team.", "NTA.

The security guard, head of security, and the guard at your department.\n\nI'm 33 and even though I understand 18-19 year olds are adults, I always see them as children, especially if they come to me for help. It doesn't matter what I think your reaction should have been, if you came to me for help, I would never ever make fun of you for that.\n\nHowever, It is important that you learn your lesson from this. Carry your charger with you (wouldn't help if the phone itself died) and make arrangements in advance if you're planning on staying out late.\n\nFor context, if I found myself in the same situation, I could just step out and avail a bus or some other mode of public transport. If public transport is not available in your area, then it's important you have a plan B. This can either be a case where you have told your father in advance to come pick you up even if you don't call, or a backup phone you can use in emergencies.\n\nAlso, I'm surprised the mall doesn't have a phone available for use anywhere.

Explain that you were working after hours and discovered that your phone was not working correctly. You approached the first security guard for assistance and not only did he not help but he made fun of you. You had to have a second security guard help you. You felt that the first guards actions were inappropriate so you lodged a complaint against the first officer. Not only did the head of security not take your complaint seriously, the first officer harassed you about the complaint.\n\nEven if he felt that you were being a 'silly girl', the first guard should have calmed you down, maybe taken you to the security office and let you call your father or someone to come get you. And there should be a dedicated landline that people can use in cases like these- are you supposed to wait in a deserted mall while your phone charges?

No matter how hard I try, I CANNOT learn how to orient myself on roads.

I started panicking, but I *thought* that *maybe* I could remember how to get back to the highway, and if I found the highway I could make it home. I got horribly lost, and I called my dad bawling like a baby, because I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly from panic that my mom has worked in that same city since before I was born.

In the restaurant, if one shift ended and we could not go out in a group, one of the cooks (usually a man) walked us to our car. You could see our cars from the back door of the restaurant also.

Fuck those people.", "NTA if I lived near that mall (and I hope I don\u2019t) I wouldn\u2019t go there because the security guards are unsafe.", "NTA.  File a harassment complaint with the owners of the mall - for both the security guard and his boss.  Contact LnI as well.  Get this guy, and his boss, shitcanned.  It\u2019s behavior like this, that leads to women getting assaulted, or even murdered.  YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT!!!!!", "Yeah you are NTA. That\u2019s literally part of their job and that guys a major ass and so is his boss", "Nope and I would immediately change jobs.", "NTA. Dont let this go, fight for your right to feel safe around them. It's their literal job to make sure you're okay. You're still a kid tbh, and didnt deserve to be treated like that. If head security is a dick as well, there will be people higher up the chain, find them.", "NTA - That's really bad security management.  Also, get an android for your next phone if you want one that you can rely on.", "NTA but the guard didn't do anything unlawful or didn't perform his job, and a single text message isn't harassment. Low chance that this would go anywhere. So I would just drop it and pick up a burner phone in case it happens again.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, report further up the chain and that he harassed you after the first. Call corporate and complain separately as well.", "Go over his head to the mall manager or owner. Escalate this, please. NTA", "Contact the company directly and make your complaint with them.", "NTA and he came at you again after you complained, that\u2019s gotta be retaliation I\u2019m sure.", "NTA. Very inappropriate behavior. If he didnt want to let you use his phone, he should have taken you to a landline for you to use, then waited with you for your ride to show up. \n\nComplain about his behavior to YOUR boss. Let your boss complain to security or the managers of the mall property. That will get a better response. Good luck.", "NTA. I am sorry that there's nobody else left for you to complain to. Midnight in a dark mall? I'd have been terrified.", "I don't know why you think your actions \"potentially cost him his job\" when his own manager/superior responded telling you they were going to ignore your complaint and then the initial security guard contacted you to basically brag (and INFO: How did he get your number?).\n\nYou should take this action up with the mall admin staff itself as the contractor of the security officers (or failing that, if the security firm is a chain reach out to their head office), or at the very least put in a suggestion for an emergency phone available in common areas for staff.\n\nNTA.", "Nta\u2026 escalate this with your parents.", "NTA cops and guards will always stick together OP, you were in the right.", "Yta. \nIt seems like you think you feel extra entitled because you are \u201ca tiny teenage girl\u201d\n\nFirst off, you are an adult. \n\nSecond off, you shouldn\u2019t expect people to be nice to you because you are a small girl, a \u201cyoung\u201d girl, or a girl in general. \n\nIdk why you think you are special and you are 18, not 14 or even 16", "Yta. \nIt seems like you think you feel extra entitled because you are \u201ca tiny teenage girl\u201d\n\nFirst off, you are an adult. \n\nSecond off, you shouldn\u2019t expect people to be nice to you because you are a small girl, a \u201cyoung\u201d girl, or a girl in general. \n\nIdk why you think you are special and you are 18, not 14 or even 16", "When is mocking a scared, crying girl not inappropriate?", "Mall management should be notified as to ALL of it.", "Document it all, times, when he called you, all of it and do exactly what Pepper said. You were lucky, the  next young girl or boy might not be.", "Both my dad and my boyfriend have sent in complaints and my boyfriends mom has threatened to sue.", "[deleted]", "But iPhone purple :(", "Just kidding. I do plan on getting an android. The iPhone was just cheaper for my plan.", "He didn\u2019t preform his job and he ridiculed me for asking him for help. That\u2019s a fireable offense.", "You should want to help a young person who is in need.", "They are there to provide security. She was in an unsecure situation. All he had to do was make a phone call. He wasn't doing his job. This has nothing to do with gender politics.", "I mean, no I do think people should treat me well because I\u2019m small and in danger. That\u2019s exactly what I think. I think I\u2019m entitled to compassion. I think everyone is. And I don\u2019t look 18. So I could have been a lost minor and he treated me like shit. \n\n\nWe should want to protect each other, especially when it\u2019s your FUCKING JOB.", "It was his job to protect and help me. That\u2019s literally what they are for.", "You should want to help people around you.", "How did the security who later called you get your number?", "She's actually an adult in most places, and the *crying* seems a little over the top in terms of a reaction. She says she was \"freaking out\" about being alone *in the place she works*? I am not sure I understand what made her feel so scared, but it sounds a little extra. Does that seem like a typical reaction from a college aged girl *in a shopping mall?*? \n\nI didn't mean to to suggest it would be appropriate for anyone to mock her though, just that a security guard, while not quite a cop, has *some* duty to protect. The custodian really doesn't.\n\nA janitor working at night when the mall was closed might not generally interact with people at all. This is actually an ideal job for people with social anxiety, ASD, ADHD, or who are in recovery, but sometimes their behavior isn't as compassionate or \"appropriate\" as we might like.", "How did he get her personal number? Creepy.", "Yes. This is textbook harassment.", "Hey bud, it turns out people can actually cry for whatever reason they want. There\u2019s actually no rules about it!", "Good. If they do this to you, imagine what they will do.to customers.", "So they\u2019re not supposed to help people in distress? Which she obviously was", "Have you read his contract? He saw a problem and reported it to the other security guard. I'm not sure he is liable. Security guards are regularly dicks, never saw one getting fired over it. I don't think this is a battle you should pick.", "I'm guessing you're not a woman. Malls at midnight are freaking creepy. I am a woman who is not easily creeped out, I walk alone at night plenty, but I won't see late movies at a mall unless I'm going in the same car with someone else because it's just super creepy.", "You clearly don't understand the kind of fears women live with.", "If my daughter told me about this there would be hell to pay.  Would stand by her through the whole process, but make sure something is done about that security guard.  That is someone who doesn't need to be in that position if he dismisses the people he is suppose to help.", "Hear, hear!", "My boyfriend used to be a security guard for the company. What he did was against his contract.", "Don\u2019t twist my words- I didn\u2019t say anything about men vs women crying. And do you not understand the danger for a young woman stranded alone at night with no way to contact anyone? Why are tears not acceptable for fear as a young adult? She was *scared*. It\u2019s totally acceptable for anyone to cry due to fear.", "It\u2019s actually ridiculous of u to not realize women are obviously way more prone to crying than men.", "Wow. Based on what? I am the mother, aunt and grandmom of girls, and while I am old, I *am* a woman.", "Sounded like it was updating to me. Flashing the Apple logo sounds like what happens when it\u2019s doing an iOS update.", "Good luck then.", "I think training is the biggest issue here.  In my (non management experienced) mind everyone there needs to be retrained on how to handle customer interactions.\n\nBecause, when you are a security guard, that is part of your job.  Being approachable, being someone that instills confidence in strangers.  Being the person that those that are around you can look to in a crisis.  The guards that op dealt with... don't met any of my own expectations for myself let alone what my company expects out of the guards we employ.  \n\nActually funny story, I had a contractor at my site tell me, today, \"you're too friendly to be a security guard.\" \n\nExcuse me..?   And then!!!  The facility manager (the one who contracted my company) not 10 minutes later, comes walking by and I asked if he needed anything (he looked stressed) and he said \"nope, just keep smiling and greeting people and asking people how their day is.\"   What kind of mixed messages is this!?  Ugh!  \ud83d\ude02"]}
