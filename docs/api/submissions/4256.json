It is understandable that you would be upset and frightened when your phone stopped working and you were alone in the mall, and the security guard should have offered you help and support instead of making fun of you.

He's a security guard. Part of his JOB is ensuring you safety. If he had been a custodian, his response would not seem as inappropriate, but as a security guard... WTF?\n\nIs there a landline phone at your place of employment you could have used?", "NTA. His actions were reprehensible. You feeling unsafe is the REASON security is there. Report, document, escalate. His actions are putting the mall at a severe liability. If you don\u2019t feel safe talking to security because of this and you get hurt, the mall may be liable.", "NTA. Even if you weren't visibly upset - his response to you was incredibly unprofessional and just shitty as a person.

The security guard, head of security, and the guard at your department.\n\nI'm 33 and even though I understand 18-19 year olds are adults, I always see them as children, especially if they come to me for help. It doesn't matter what I think your reaction should have been, if you came to me for help, I would never ever make fun of you for that.\n\nHowever, It is important that you learn your lesson from this. Carry your charger with you (wouldn't help if the phone itself died) and make arrangements in advance if you're planning on staying out late.\n\nFor context, if I found myself in the same situation, I could just step out and avail a bus or some other mode of public transport. If public transport is not available in your area, then it's important you have a plan B. This can either be a case where you have told your father in advance to come pick you up even if you don't call, or a backup phone you can use in emergencies.\n\nAlso, I'm surprised the mall doesn't have a phone available for use anywhere.

Explain that you were working after hours and discovered that your phone was not working correctly. You approached the first security guard for assistance and not only did he not help but he made fun of you. You had to have a second security guard help you. You felt that the first guards actions were inappropriate so you lodged a complaint against the first officer. Not only did the head of security not take your complaint seriously, the first officer harassed you about the complaint.\n\nEven if he felt that you were being a 'silly girl', the first guard should have calmed you down, maybe taken you to the security office and let you call your father or someone to come get you. And there should be a dedicated landline that people can use in cases like these- are you supposed to wait in a deserted mall while your phone charges?

No matter how hard I try, I CANNOT learn how to orient myself on roads. Out in the forest on a hike with no trail, I can navigate no problem, but roads confuse my internal compass to no end for some reason.

I started panicking, but I *thought* that *maybe* I could remember how to get back to the highway, and if I found the highway I could make it home. I got horribly lost, and I called my dad bawling like a baby, because I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly from panic that my mom has worked in that same city since before I was born.

So I called her, and I was panicking the whole time she was trying to direct me, until she finally helped me find the highway home.

The fact that you can be trapped there with no ability to get home is an issue if you forget your phone or there's something wrong with it etc", "She was probably crying because she was frustrated with the non working phone, had no way to call an Uber or get home (other than walking in the dark for a bus/train/walking home) and no way to call her father for a ride. The combination of those things played havoc with her emotions.", "You copied this comment posted an hour ago\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg35kq/aita_for_reporting_a_security_guard_at_my_work/izfotto?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "That's a fair point. Thank you for your perspective!!", "Please follow up with your boss and see this through with the security guards. When I was your age I worked at 2 retail stores and a restaurant in the mall. We were NEVER allowed to be in the stores alone at closing, there was always another employee with us to make sure we were safe. Security also made sure we all got out to our cars safely after work. In the restaurant, if one shift ended and we could not go out in a group, one of the cooks (usually a man) walked us to our car. You could see our cars from the back door of the restaurant also. Your manager needs to make sure that there is more than one person there that late. It is not safe for an employee to be in the mall that late alone.", "It is the AH guard's fault for choosing to make fun at you for being upset.", "As someone whose phone is on its last legs, I can agree. Sometimes a phone just stops working, or the battery/sim card comes loose, or you forget to charge it etc.", "Same, even now pushing 40, bc that's a scary af situation to be in, especially being so young.", "Exactly. Heck, I STILL break down and bawl at certain situations. For me, it\u2019s not being alone with no way to contact someone; instead, it\u2019s being lost with no way of finding my way to somewhere familiar. I have absolutely ZERO sense of direction. No matter how hard I try, I CANNOT learn how to orient myself on roads. Out in the forest on a hike with no trail, I can navigate no problem, but roads confuse my internal compass to no end. I NEED a GPS to get me to places I haven\u2019t already been to dozens of times. If something would happen to my GPS (my phone nowadays) while I was using it, I would ABSOLUTELY cry, just like OP. And I\u2019m nearly 32.\n\nWhen I was on my way home after my interview for my current job, before I had a smartphone, my Garmin literally FELL TO PIECES as I was trying to put home into it to start going home. I started panicking, but I *thought* that *maybe* I could remember how to get back to the highway, and if I found the highway I could make it home. I got horrible lost, and I called my dad bawling like a baby, because I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly from panic that my mom works in the same city since before I was born. He reminded me that he didn\u2019t know the city but she did and to call her. So I called her, and I was panicking the whole time she was trying to direct me. And I still do panic and bawl when I get lost.\n\nSome people are just more prone to crying in a stressful situation. That doesn\u2019t make them immature or \u201cbabies\u201d; that makes them humans in need of a little assistance. OP needs to keep pursuing this, because those \u201csecurity\u201d guards are major AHs who don\u2019t really offer security.", "I talked to my parents last night after this interaction and they said they\u2019re going to buy me a car in a few months and until then they will pick me up every day from work. The plan was always for me to get a car for my graduation but they\u2019re going to kind of fast forward.", "I second this.   I am female but I have walked employees out to their cars before (Not at night, usually when it's raining and they don't want to have to remember to return the umbrellas we offer the next day) but I absolutely would offer to escort an employee out to their car if the expressed concerns; or if, like in cases of retail security (I don't work retail)  I would 100%, without having to be asked, make sure to escort anyone who was alone at night to their cars.  Even if it was a manager.  Idgaf.  \n\nParking lots are weird and sketchy sometimes. Especially retail parking lots, where you're dealing with customers all day?  Hell no, im not letting anyone go to their car alone at night. \n\nI'm okay with being responsible for my own safety.  I'm not okay with letting other people take risks with theirs while I'm on shift when I can do something to mitigate that risk \ud83d\ude02", "After what happened to you its the best decision, Op, stay safe and continue to make complaints, take it to the max if you can, these people cannot laugh at your desperation, imagine if it was his own daughter (which I hope he's not a father) he would lose his shit", "I\u2019m so glad for you that your parents are able to help you avoid this situation from now on! Seriously, that whole security company sounds like a haven for AHs.", "Great point!\n\nAlso, I worked in multiple malls when I was in my teens and early 20s. They are universally ridiculously creepy at night. Back then, I\u2019d sometimes have to wait for my ride to get there. Thank goodness the security teams were always courteous and took the safety of young people working late seriously.", "I don\u2019t know about him, but I know for a fact the guard assigned to my workplace is a father to 2 daughters.", "That makes me so angry, not a single ounce of empathy, many people are blaming you for crying, I'm 20, also a girl. You don't know how many times I've cried because I was scared and alone, it's normal, especially if your phone died! You were alone in a mall ffs! These times it is super dangerous to be a woman alone at night (well... all day too, sadly but worse at night) and your feelings are valid, hopefully that bully will be reprimanded for his nasty actions. \n\nA security guard is there to help you, not bully you, sending happy wishes your way!", "Are you genuinely that dumb", "No I just follow actual statics and facts. Although women make up the majority of rape victims. Men are more likely to be victims of violence. \n\nhttps://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/men-women-and-crime", "Ah yes, a study from 1993, very good source.", "Lets ignore your random statistics, whose the more obvious target in a dark mall at midnight, an 18 year old girl with no form of communication or an older male security guard with probably something to defend himself with and a form of communication?"]}
