Change book club night and don't tell the non readers.", "NTA\n\nI mean reading the book and discussing it is the main reason you have a book club.", "NTA - The whole purpose of any club is the primary function it has.  A book club is about reading books.  You should kick out the non-readers.", "NTA.  The see the gathering as a social event.  It is a book club.   Discuss the book and if they don\u2019t like it then hopefully they will phase out.", "NTA if you don\u2019t want to read or discuss the book, then don\u2019t join a book club.", "NTA, that's the whole point of the meeting? They probably thought it was a sip and talk. Why the hell would you join a book club with other people if you're just going to sit in your clique and not contribute to the main purpose of the meeting?", "NAH, it's literally a BOOK club.\n\nIt's okay if it's not really a book club, if most of the members are okay with that.  But if there are members who actually want a book club, it seems like a reasonable ask, doesn't it?\n\nDon't worry if the non-readers don't respond.  They might have set up their own wine club without telling you, which would be great.", "LOL, I belong to a knitting club. When we meet online, we do work on our projects. When we meet in person...not so much.  Book clubs are similar. They might start out reading the books, but life can get in the way. Plus, you throw in some wine and people see the club meetings as a place to unwind. Try this, ask everyone if they want to truly keep it a book club or would they rather just meet for fun.", "NTA. You've been accommodating enough. Give everyone a final reminder of what the club is about and next time kick out the non-readers after asking who has not read the book.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Such chutzpah.", "Retired people can be the worst.  Suddenly they're too busy for anything and end up doing nothing they say they will yet continually harp on about how busy they are all the time.  Busy doing WHAT?  If you say you'll do something, do it, or don't agree to do it in the first place.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Its not a book club if you aren't discussing a book.  Then its just a gossip and wine night - not that there is anything wrong with that, but it's not the purpose........especially if some are reading the books and want to discuss them....", "LOL. I may use this analogy. Thanks!", "They are still my friends, and I will still see them several times a month at the other organization.", "First rule about book club...", "I think as long as there is food and wine, they will stay, unless we ask them to leave.", "I would be okay with that. Most of them don't have the best taste in wine. LOL.", "That is the issue. The majority do want to keep it a book club. It is a minority, but a decent sized one, that is just there as a social club. We have offered to have a separate social meeting. There are some months when the book is not very thought-provoking, and it is 95% social. But some months when the book would lead to a lot of discussion, these women derail the discussion.", "Does he meeting place vary?   If so, set it up for the readers to host in succession and offer coffee, tea, and cookies.   They can find somewhere else to go.", "You are between a rock and a hard place. All I can suggest is that at the next meeting the readers focus on the book and try to ignore the derailers.  Otherwise, you will have to set up two separate meetings and split the group and that will not go down well.", "NTA,\nReminds me an episode of Malcolm in the middle. Book Club", "Nta. Perhaps try hosting a movie night based on the book, then discuss the book/movie at the next meeting so everyone can be involved.", "NTA\n\nThey wanted a social club.", "\" The readers have offered to do a \"Night Out\" separate from the club, but there has been minimal response.\" .. Do a night out with the readers, and switch the readers to that, and have the readers leave the \"book club\" and meet at another time (or somewhere else) to discuss your books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet the non readers organize their own hangouts.", "NTA. I'm a book club fiend, and that behavior sounds so annoying. \n\nBut also, please tell me the name of the \"very interesting book!\" My group just read Midnight Library, and we haaaated it.", "NTA\n\nBook club... Says it in the title.... If you don't have time or find time to get and read the book, find another club as this isn't the one for you.", "I somehow can understand not wanting to read but coming to a book club and trying to stop others from talking about books? That takes this from odd to ridiculous", "lol, no chance you are TA. It's a book club, where you are meant to discuss books. NTA.", "NTA - but maybe just go ahead and schedule a wine night, no reading required.", "NTA\u2026if they want to be in the book club, they read the book.  If they just want a get together, they can organize that for another night.", "NTA I'd assume the whole point of book club is to read and discuss the book. Even if the person tries the book, doesn't like it and doesn't finish it, they can still contribute their opinions and reasons. There may be times when there has been little opportunity to read the book but in that case I wouldn't least read the Wikipedia entry so I wasn't entirely clueless during conversation.  There is a social aspect but that is secondary to the common interest of reading and discussing literature. If these non-readers are actively choosing to not partake in the book part of book club, they should find a different group better aligned with their interests or arrange to meet book club friends away from book club and leave book club for book people.", "NTA. I would have thought that as a private club you can set whatever rules you want, as long as you don't discriminate against protected characteristics.  So insisting it is a book club and you discuss the book is fine. Do a bit of book discussion, bring out drinks and nibbles and at the same time continue discussion. If they don't take part chuck them out.", "NTA \n\nThe whole point is to read the book", "You say \"the book\".  Can people chose which book they can read?\n\nPretty certain I'm missing something here! :)", "NTA. Keep the ladies in the loop but implement a rule that if you have not read the book, you cannot attend the next meeting.", "NTA book club should be for the readers? The non-readers that just want a social night can set a different night.", "NTA.\n\nIt'd be one thing if it was *occasional*. But this is every month? They have to read the book!", "One time, we watched the movie at the club after reading the book. Hardly anyone paid attention, the movie was awful, and did not follow the book. PS - the book we read this month had a movie. They didn't watch it.", "We just read Prince of Tides. There was A LOT to discuss. Don't watch the movie. Some people made that mistake. I will check out Midnight Library. Thanks!", "Usually, in a book club everyone reads the same book and meets to discuss it. Then (usually) \u2018vote\u2019 in the next book and meet again to discuss that one, and so on\u2026", "in a book club, everyone reads the same book and then you gather to talk about it. So if people don\u2019t read the book, they can\u2019t contribute to the discussion about the book", "All of the book? Some women start the book, but don't finish because they are too busy, hate it, or it is just really long!", "This is going to sound like a dumb question, but why not just plan a different outing or get together with these friends and and keep the book club to readers only?", "Have one dry meeting and tell them it's permanent. Once they leave, go back to wine and food but don't tell them. LoL NTA", "I just want to know what this month's book was", "Aahh. Thank you!  I'm a dumbass! :)", "Yep, makes sense.  Thanks.", "You can implement the rule but then privately agree to enforce it only if it's a repeated occurrence. There's a difference between \"Aerith didn't read the entire book because it sucks, and also her husband just died\" and \"Deryn just hates reading\".", "It says in the post that they tried to organise a night out separate from reading the book and got minimal response back about it.", "Either they want the bragging rights of being in a book club or they want to believe that they are readers and will definitely get the book next time.", "We already meet at a different house every month. No wine may upset the readers. \ud83d\ude05", "I don't think it is purposeful, but since they didn't read the book, they have nothing to talk about during that time, and end up starting their own conversation. But they aren't sitting next to each other, so it derails the book conversation.", "Maybe they need to not make a big deal out of it not being a book club meeting. Just have the usual causal fun meeting on the usual day then have a book club meeting another day.", "Ah, sorry. Poor morning attention-span on my part.", "NTA \n\nThe purpose of a book club is to read the book. I would love to join a book club but aside from anxiety and other reasons I usually hate the books they choose to read so I won't be joining any book club. If you don't want to read then don't joing a book club, if they're so busy they could even try audio books", "NTA - the clue is in the name. It\u2019s not a \u2018nice night in with nibbles and drinks\u2019 club - its a \u2018book club\u2019 and 80% -90% of the time you should have read the book.", "NTA \n\nI totally understand that the ladies are looking for social interaction and your book club sounds fun. \n\nBut to never ever read the book and then leave the meeting before discussing the actual book is just plain ballsy and rude. \n\nThe point of a book club is to read a book. \n\nWhat if you switched the order of events and begin discussing the books right away (while you sip and eat), then end with the gossiping and socializing? Maybe they\u2019d naturally stop coming.", "NTA.\n\nThe point of book club, to me at least, is to read the book that was chosen and discuss while also socializing and having a good time. If they aren\u2019t reading the book then they just want a group to socialize with which is fine but not the purpose of your club.", "You kids with all your gadgets and iphones!!! Pick up a book!! READ THE PHUCKING BOOK!!!\noh yeah\u2026. NTA\u2026.. obviously.", "I mean obviously you are allowed to hang out with whomever you want, in whatever configuration you want, and talk about what you want.\n\nBut what are the non-readers harming? Are they contributing equally to snack and drinks? Are they respectful of Book Talk and allow it to take priority? If so, why not just let them listen to intelligent adult conversation for an evening? (I'm jumping to the conclusion that they are seeking a \"night out\" from children or boredom or loneliness)", "NTA. It is one thing to occasionally not get to reading the book, but these people are defeating the purpose of a book club and ruining it for the people who actually want to read. Tell them the readers are going to start a second book club for readers. Then you can decide if you want to gradually drop out of the No book version of the book club.", "NAH lots of book clubs have an inclusive policy of coming whether you read it or not, and some have a \"read the book\" policy.  I would think there is some middle ground.  Say 6pm for book conversation and 7pm for social time.  Or switch to a book club and a \"book club social\" where the social meetup is just focused on catching up.  \n\nAs long as these women weren't asking me not to discuss the book, then it really wouldnt matter to me if they went outside or listened.", "Change the book discussion part of book club to a different day/time. Maintain the current day/time as the social component. Or just make the schedule official for these evenings: first 90 minutes is social time, followed by 90 minutes book discussion (obviously I don't know how long you're meeting for). The non-readers get social time and then get to leave; the readers get to have discussion time. It seems like this is already happening organically; capitalize on the trend. (NTA)", "SO?!", "You talk about book... club.", "Happy cake day.. also this made me chuckle. NTA", "It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s zen, it\u2019s beautiful. Definitely do this.", "Nah. I think they just see it as a social activity. They just want to sit around, drink wine and gossip.", "Thanks!  For both!"]}
