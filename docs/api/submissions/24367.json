Change book club night and don't tell the non readers.", "NTA\n\nI mean reading the book and discussing it is the main reason you have a book club.", "NTA - The whole purpose of any club is the primary function it has.  A book club is about reading books.  You should kick out the non-readers.", "NTA.  The see the gathering as a social event.  It is a book club.   Discuss the book and if they don\u2019t like it then hopefully they will phase out.", "NTA if you don\u2019t want to read or discuss the book, then don\u2019t join a book club.", "NTA, that's the whole point of the meeting? They probably thought it was a sip and talk. Why the hell would you join a book club with other people if you're just going to sit in your clique and not contribute to the main purpose of the meeting?", "NAH, it's literally a BOOK club.\n\nIt's okay if it's not really a book club, if most of the members are okay with that.  But if there are members who actually want a book club, it seems like a reasonable ask, doesn't it?\n\nDon't worry if the non-readers don't respond.  They might have set up their own wine club without telling you, which would be great.", "LOL, I belong to a knitting club. When we meet online, we do work on our projects. When we meet in person...not so much.  Book clubs are similar. They might start out reading the books, but life can get in the way. Plus, you throw in some wine and people see the club meetings as a place to unwind. Try this, ask everyone if they want to truly keep it a book club or would they rather just meet for fun.", "NTA. You've been accommodating enough. Give everyone a final reminder of what the club is about and next time kick out the non-readers after asking who has not read the book.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
