There may be times when there has been little opportunity to read the book but in that case I wouldn't least read the Wikipedia entry so I wasn't entirely clueless during conversation.  There is a social aspect but that is secondary to the common interest of reading and discussing literature.

I would have thought that as a private club you can set whatever rules you want, as long as you don't discriminate against protected characteristics.

Are they contributing equally to snack and drinks? Are they respectful of Book Talk and allow it to take priority? If so, why not just let them listen to intelligent adult conversation for an evening?

It is one thing to occasionally not get to reading the book, but these people are defeating the purpose of a book club and ruining it for the people who actually want to read. Tell them the readers are going to start a second book club for readers. Then you can decide if you want to gradually drop out of the No book version of the book club.", "NAH lots of book clubs have an inclusive policy of coming whether you read it or not, and some have a \"read the book\" policy.  I would think there is some middle ground.  Say 6pm for book conversation and 7pm for social time.

Maintain the current day/time as the social component.

My mom now has 2 book clubs, one where everyone reads the book and it's like bible study and one where no one reads the book and it's just a 4 hour social hour. Both are things she enjoys. There's probably a 50% crossover in members. But both have their specific desires met, and it's a good compromise. She still reads both books (unless her friend Linda in choosing, because Linda always wants to read Victorian novels where nothing bad ever happens, and that's super boring to her) because she's a big old nerd, but that's her choice. \n\nI recommend a splinter club for the people who actually want to read, and keep this as a fun night. Many might be there because their husbands have mocked them for not having a hobby, so they chose one of least resistance like book club (true (and sad) for several members of the fun club). Some might just really like the idea of being in a book club. \n\nBut I totally feel your frustration and want you to know that your feelings are valid and normal.", "I\u2019d have a \u2018book club\u2019 with everyone & another with the originals", "I was going to say that not reading all of the book is  valid to the overall experience and discussion since your finding a book too awful to finish is definitely a review. \nHowever, in this case, repeated no effort towards reading a book for the book club makes you NTA.\n\nMy only other comment is that being at home/retired doesn't make them less busy than those who work.

Another person said it very well, set a rule that if you have not at least read some portion of the book, you cannot come to the meeting.

I understand these women are your friends so you don't want to be rude but it seems they are just coming for wine and food and then disrupt the book talk with other talking because they don't sit together. If they just want wine and food maybe they can come but sit in a separate area and have their own conversations while the people in the book club want to to talk about the actual book. I personally think it's a bit rude of them to join a book club but don't actually participate and like I said before just come for food and wine.", "NTA, but what's the point of a book club if you aren't going to read the book.  \n\nI guess my next question would be, who is supplying the snacks?  Do the non readers contribute?  I know I wouldn't want to be footing the bill to feed folks who don't share in the bill or discussion.  It really adds another layer to it.", "Why do people post these? You can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re NTA for requiring reading a book to be part of a BOOK club???", "NTA, it sounds like you should split and become two different clubs. I would be very annoyed if I made the time to read a book to attend a book club and didn't get a chance to discuss the book. If other members don't want to read and just want to hang out, then cool, but they shouldn't be doing that at a book club.", "Definitely NTA", "My mum's book club had the same issue. They made a rule that you had to read 50 pages. That's not a lot but shows willing. Id go a step further and say the last word on page 50 is the password to enter the house so they are least have to have the book in their possession", "I agree. NTA. The non readers can even do audible books and just listen to it. Otherwise, kindly kick them out of this book group. There is no excuse. Why did they join a book club? If you didn't read/listen to a good portion of or all of the book, don't come to the meeting.", "So, change the night of the book club. Make the current night a new girl's night out, and choose a different night as the hook club and don't tell them. Or still have a night in like you do, minus the book portion.", "<hurries off to Libby to add to wish list>", "You would only have to do without for a few times then when the non-readers drop out, you could back to having wine.\n\nYou really need to recruit more actual readers.", "NTA your book club your rules", "NAH\n\nMy wife and I aren't religious, but she was part of a book club with mostly religious folks. Whenever they read religious themed books it turned into a social gathering for her rather than book club. \n\nMaybe ask them for a reading recommendation to see if you can get their interest. There's a small chance that you aren't reading the books they like.", "NTA, but if you want another suggestion to maintain the relationships/social parts, maybe have two events - book club for those who read, and wine cub or something for those who just want the social aspect.

That way people who are there just for the great food wine and socialization, will not have great food and wine available to them, or knowing that they have to sit through the actual book discussion before the party begins, they may either choose to read the book or just stop coming.\n\nAnd speak with the other readers about this, and maybe you just go with them hey just to let you know next session will be just a book discussion we're not going to do hors d'oeuvres and wine. See how many of the people who are reaching on the social aspect but not reading show up! And you can hide the wine and the hors d'oeuvres for later on after the non-readers don't show.", "I mean, seriously, who joins a book club and then refuses to read the dang books.", "You may establish a 3-strike rule pro year. You understand not all of the members can always read all of the books but never reading them is not an option as well.\nOr simply state that who hasn't read the book should skip the meeting and come at the next one. \ud83e\udd37", "That's interesting, my book club read the Midnight Library a while ago and we generally enjoyed it.

The non-readers get social time and then get to leave; the readers get to have discussion time\n\nThat's what we eventually did with our book club once we realized that, for some, BCN was their main/only social time away from kids and/or partners. Solved the issue!", "How big is your meeting room?  Could you physically separate the chairs into a finished the book side and haven\u2019t finished the book side?\n\nOr announce 30 mins or so in to the meeting yous are going to discuss the book now but anyone who hasn\u2019t finished is free to leave / get snacks / whatever.\n\nAnother option is to spend the meeting time being social and then say at the end that anyone who wants to discuss book can stay on a bit later / or arrive earlier if that suits better."]}
