But why bother?  Just smile, nicely, and continue to make money as her dissatisfied customers continue to switch over to you.\n\nBTW, what you're doing is the essence of a free market. You're making a better product and selling it for less money.", "You'd be an AH to make the comment about the quality of her products.\n\nYou're NTA to continue going about your business as you are. You have just as much right to be there as she does, and it sounds like her customers are conveying the quality message to her.", "Nta. She started it by blaming you for outcompeting her. Are you undercharging for your quality? You still wouldn\u2019t be ta but might be worth considering", "NTA, she doesn't own the convention", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldnt pay her any attention.\n\nIf it were me, Id text back 'excuse me? who are you? I wasnt aware there was anyone else in my niche at this event'", "NTA but don't bother with her. Just ignore her and keep making your quality products.", "NTA. \n\nThe two of you clearly illustrate the advantage of competition to the consumer.", "YWBTA if you respond. Not worth your time or energy. Roll your eyes, shake your head & walk away. \n\nShe may feel like she\u2019s in competition with you but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s even playing in your league. Her problems are not your problems.", "NTA. It's not your fault that people are complaining about her work and purchasing yours instead because those people view yours as better quality. She should either lower her price or up her quality.", "Yes, YWBTA for saying that. However, there's really no point. The customers have already pointed it out by asking for refunds. She can't kick you off \"her patch\" so keep doing your thing.", "Don't send her anything in a message that you would be embarrassed to have made public. Right now, she was out of line to send you a message basically demanding you stop your business, because she had no right to do that. She isn't Disney. She can't claim that she owns exclusive rights to the market you're both in.\n\nHowever, you would be the AHole for offering unsolicited feedback on her product. Take the high road. Just ignore her.", "YWBTA she already knows this, hence the complaints and refunds. Why rub it in her face?\n\nTake the high road like you are already doing and be proud of your hard work!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s no need to say anything she might use as ammo against you.

Focus on your long-term success and remain professional.  \n\nThere's a saying something like, If you get in a mudslinging contest with a pig you both end up covered in shit, but the pig enjoys it", "NTA \nIt\u2019s a common thing at conventions.  Anyone with similar styles but different quality is going to have some issues.  \nIf she\u2019s charging as much as you are for poor work, that\u2019s her fault.  \n\nIgnore her.  Any response can be twisted by her and used to make you look bad.", "No. Competition is part of doing business. She has to adapt. Respond, but be diplomatic: don't make it about her product, don't make it personal. Don't throw around the word \"you\" without careful consideration for its effect. It's simple enough to say you have every right to sell your wares there, and that customers are choosing to buy them. You could also just ignore her.", "Here's a thought just charge a few dollars more then said opponent. Nothing crazy $5 tops. That way you are undoubtedly not the asshole. You charge more for a better product. Now what will she say. Ntah all in all though. She is not producing the same product as op there for she has no leg to stand on.", "NTA this is the comment to listen to, do not engage with her at all.  Do not cause drama, do not say anything that could appear on social media.  You do you and make your money.  Target and Walmart don't throw shade at each other after all.", "He would be an AH for telling her the truth?", "Ofcourse I'm undercharging for my quality I have imposters syndrome \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I am very much undercharging, something I sell at $40 is easily going for $90-150 online in places like etsy", "Small world. Best to just move on.", "Do yourself a favor and up your prices a little. You don't have to go all the way to etsy prices, but if people were willing to pay the $40 for her not-good stuff until they saw yours for the same price, they will totally pay higher for yours and you win twice- you're out of her range for \"competition\" and you get paid more for your attention to detail and standards. I'd feel out the prices with yourself, like if you're charging $40 and $45 would feel fine, and $50 would be ok, but $75 would make you think \"oh, I could never sell for that\", fit them in between ok and uncomfortable eg. $60. People who would buy for $90-$150 without being able to see the work in person, are still going to be \\*thrilled\\* to pay $60-$70 for something that they can vet in person."]}
