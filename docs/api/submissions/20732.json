We remained good friends for another 3 years until he died of a liver disease recently. I was his will executor up until last year when I moved out of state and we decided he should have someone close to home as executor.\n\nAccording to him, he chose a good friend of his. He did not want any of his family as executors. \n\nHis family has always hated me, for reasons I don\u2019t even know. I was 18 when I met my ex. Just a kid. But I rubbed them the wrong way for 25 years. They didn\u2019t even tell me when he passed away. I heard it a day later through someone who isn\u2019t even a friend.\n\nHe got extremely sick very quickly and died very quickly. But he had battled a liver disease for years. I had just spoken to him a week before he died and he sounded ok.\n\nI knew what his final wishes were so I sent them to his family. I helped them find all his relevant paperwork from afar. Told them how to get into his safes, who to call for insurance policies, how to get in touch with the VA for his cremation and internment to be covered.\n\nThese were the wishes of my ex: for me to help his mother as much as I could. So I did it. And then she shut me out once she got what she wanted. I found out later through his work and other policies that he left me on as beneficiary. Though I already figured this because he told me. His family is pissed.\n\nHis mom won\u2019t share his most current will. Kept telling me she was following his \u201cwritten wishes\u201d for me not to be involved. But wouldn\u2019t share those \u201cwishes\u201d with me. She wouldn\u2019t allow me to go to his funeral. Told me as long as I didn\u2019t go, my family could attend to say goodbye. I didn\u2019t go so that my family at least had that closure.\n\nI still don\u2019t have a copy of his current will but my ex told me two weeks before he passed that I was in it. I\u2019m now under the impression that he never changed his will like he told me. That he kept me on as executor.\n\nHis mother emailed me this past weekend to tell me she was petitioning the court to become executor, with no other explanation, which makes no sense unless:\n\n1. The executor he told me he was changing it to decided she wanted nothing to do with his crazy family or she had too much work as an intellectual property attorney to deal with his estate. His family had told me she was handling his estate.\n\n2. I was always listed as executor and his family is going to pretend that he didn\u2019t have a will.\n\nI can\u2019t get the woman who I was told by my ex was executor to contact me. She was a good friend of his but her and I didn\u2019t have good relations.\n\nI\u2019ve hired an attorney who basically wrote the probate laws in the state where my ex passed. Right now, I\u2019m only asking the woman who I thought was executor for a copy of his will, copying his mother. But could you blame me if I sue them all for everything they have if I find out I was supposed to be executor?\n\nSo many more nuances to this story. Not enough space to explain.

If he really didn\u2019t want me involved or didn\u2019t leave me a thing (other than the companies that have contacted me), I can accept that. But I know what he told me and his family isn\u2019t proving otherwise so I feel like I have no choice but to try to honor his last wishes. He didn\u2019t want his mother as executor for this very reason. She\u2019s a shark in bloody water. It breaks my heart that I\u2019m doing something he never wanted to happen.", "Yes! I agree.

You are not to blame here and I wager that if he were able to he would tell you to go through with this!... It's *them* doing things he didn't want to happen, not you! You're trying to get everything to go as he planned. You're doing what he wanted! Don't feel guilty for honouring his wishes!", "But he probably foresaw (is that a word?) that she would do this, which is why he made sure she would not be the executor.\n\nNo one wants this to happen after they die but you are NTA for fighting to ensure that what he stipulated and wanted is carried out.", "I don\u2019t know where you live but I\u2019m in the UK and you can order copies of peoples wills from the government.

Make a reports about it because of they're not in the will or of you're in it and they don't win the case of removing you from it, they may want to act on these threats.. You need to protect yourself and take them seriously. Especially to let them know that you won't be putting up with it!..", "His biggest fear and hate in life was that his family fought over money. His grandpa was a city attorney and a millionaire and he saw firsthand what happened when he died. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate what I\u2019m doing, unless he understood why. I never wanted his money. Only his time. He couldn\u2019t give that to me so he left me money. We argued about it endlessly. I just don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m doing is ok with him.

I could have made it in time to say goodbye.) Much less having to hire an attorney for some BS that doesn\u2019t have to happen if his family would be transparent.", "You are very correct. Foresaw is a word", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too. So now I\u2019m at the part where they\u2019re going to lie, steal, and cheat. Which is why I decided an attorney might be the best route.

I live in one state. He lives in another. My ex died in another. So many nuances to filing reports. Trust me, I googled it. I\u2019ve got the texts and I\u2019ll share them with my attorney if they come up. But if anything actually happens to me, my family has all the texts too.\n\nI don\u2019t think his family is contesting the will. I think they\u2019re going to pretend he didn\u2019t have one. The confusing part is that the woman I thought was executor was also supposed to be representing them. But now his mother is petitioning to become executor. What happened to the friend?

His family did. If they'd have just followed the will, they could have just asked you for financial help and you would have been more likely to help than after their current behavior.", "Keep doing what you think he would have wanted!\n\nFor now, until you get a copy of the will, try not to upset yourself over this! Deal with everything as it comes. But just try to be true to what he wanted.", "Maybe the friend knows they're trying to hide the will so has distanced herself from it all and doesn't want to be involved with it. I can understand why she would do that because what they're doing is illegal and she has her life and career to protect.\n\nI hope your attourey gets that will as soon as possible so you can get clarity on what's happening.", "No. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d want me dismissed at all.\n\nYou\u2019re right, I AM torturing myself.

If I screw up, I\u2019m sure my ex will forgive me for at least trying to make things right.", "I LOVE that you thought of this. This is actually one of the main reasons I hired an attorney. I think the same thing. His family is extremely difficult and combative. She didn\u2019t know what she was getting into. I will bet everything I have on this.\n\nI figured by hiring an attorney, she can\u2019t really ignore me anymore. I\u2019m personally someone she can ignore. Another attorney might not be.", "Exactly!\n\nIf he were here he would see that you're doing this to honour his wishes... You were married for 22 yrs and we're friends afterwards. That makes for a fantastic and trusting relationship. You're just trying to make sure his last words are respected. \n\nGood luck and please update us on this. I really and truly hope everything works out.", "All your ex will have expected of you is to do your best to enact his wishes as well as you can, in the face of his money-grabbing family and their actions.\n\nYou are doing exactly that, so however things turn out, I don't think he would be disappointed in you. My instinct is that he would be grateful, especially knowing how hard it is on you to do this.", "I will. Thank you so much for everything!!"]}
