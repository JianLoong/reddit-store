My wife\u2019s and I priority was the twins relationship. They did have a good relationship before, and its changed a lot.\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk to him at the same time, my wife talked to him first, about family therapy, and how he couldn\u2019t put any effort in his relationship with Jane, then expect anything from her.\n\nJane the talked to him a little while after. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything from her then. \n2 days ago, they had another talk. Don\u2019t know what was said, but it was enough for John to accept family therapy with her. He\u2019s just made it clear he still doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, and for her to never bring me up around him.\n\nJane has been much more happier now. \n\nThey\u2019re out to watch Barbie and Oppenheimer as i\u2019m typing this.", "created_utc": 1690682167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d98lp/update_aita_for_telling_my_step_son_he_shouldnt/", "score": 362, "replies": ["[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154wmop/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_he_shouldnt_have_been/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "Wut happens when she invites u to an event and he wants to also be there?

Dude seriously needs to loosen up.", "Prepare for another AITA post", "Especially when the day comes that Jane wants both OP and John at an event.

That is not even the goal of their therapy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I hope John will eventually accept OP atleast enough to make his mother and sister not have to choose between the two of them for any events.\" .. the muich more reasonable outcome is that the twins will have a discussion about who will come (OP, or the son) without damage to THEIR relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes not sound like the relationship between OP and son IS salvageable, or that anybody is trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nall of this sounds like: Accepting that the twins can have a relationship while OP and son do not and won't be in the same room.", "I mean, one day Jane will likely get married. She will probably want OP to give her away, but will likely also want her brother there.", "And they are doing therapy now for her to understand she can not have that, and to find a reasonable way of managing her emotions in that situation.", "She should be able to have that.

His boundary is completely fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo sister will have to learn to live with that not happening.", ">His boundary is completely fine.\n\nNot really. Yes, he's allowed to have whatever boundaries he wants, but that doesn't mean they can't be ridiculous. Unless OP has done something to actively harm his relationship with John, refusing to be at the same event as him is less about protecting himself from someone who is bad for his mental health and more him being petty about his mom having a new husband and his siter accepting him as her dad. If his boundary is less about how OP has treated him and more bc his family has accepted OP, then it's not a reasonable boundary to have. \n\nIf John would genuinely avoid his sister's wedding solely to avoid someone who-assuming OP isn't hiding something-hasn't done anything bad to John, then yes, he does need help bc he is allowing his hate to overwhelm his love. If his issue stems from the fact that he's upset his mom married OP and not that OP harmed their relationship, then that is an issue he needs therapy for. It's not healthy to let his relationships with other ppl to suffer just bc he didn't want a stepfather.", "The point of therapy is not to teach girls to accept letting the boys around them dictate important life events for them. Hope this helps \ud83d\udc95", "Your take on this is ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANYBODY is free to decide who he sees or refuses to see. And OBVIOUSLY there was  SOMETHING BAD between them, not even OP denies that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" It's not healthy to let his relationships with other ppl to suffer just bc he didn't want a stepfather.\" .. That's what the sister's therapy is for: so she won't suffer, and learn to live with it.", ">ANYBODY is free to decide who he sees or refuses to see.\n\nYes of course you're free to decide. But making that decision for a bad reason is, well, bad. What if the sister got a boyfriend and John didn't like him. Not bc of anything the boyfriend said or did, not bc the boyfriend is a bad person or something-it's just that John doesn't like him. Or maybe it's something super small, like John doesn't like how he dresses or something. If John were to refuse to go to their wedding just bc he didn't like the boyfriend for no reason, he'd be an asshole. He'd be throwing his relationship with his sister away bc he can't put up with someone he dislikes for no reason for a few hours. \n\nJust bc you have the right to do something doesn't mean you can't be an asshole if you're being petty or unreasonable about it. You have the right to abandon your child just bc you want to start over with a new family, but you'd be an asshole if you did it.\n\n>And OBVIOUSLY there was SOMETHING BAD between them, not even OP denies that.\n\nDoes someone accuse OP of this? Bc I don't see OP admitting or refusing to deny that something bad happened. In the original post, he says things were tense when he married their mom and John dislikes him no matter what he does. I don't see any evidence of OP hiding anything devious. \n\n>That's what the sister's therapy is for: so she won't suffer, and learn to live with it.\n\nSo she can live with it, yes. Not so she won't suffer. That's not something a therapist can help with. And it's certainly not a guarantee that their relationship is going to last if they can't manage this compromise."]}
