My wife\u2019s and I priority was the twins relationship. They did have a good relationship before, and its changed a lot.\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk to him at the same time, my wife talked to him first, about family therapy, and how he couldn\u2019t put any effort in his relationship with Jane, then expect anything from her.\n\nJane the talked to him a little while after. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything from her then. \n2 days ago, they had another talk. Don\u2019t know what was said, but it was enough for John to accept family therapy with her. He\u2019s just made it clear he still doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, and for her to never bring me up around him.\n\nJane has been much more happier now. \n\nThey\u2019re out to watch Barbie and Oppenheimer as i\u2019m typing this.", "created_utc": 1690682167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d98lp/update_aita_for_telling_my_step_son_he_shouldnt/", "score": 38, "replies": ["[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154wmop/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_he_shouldnt_have_been/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "Wut happens when she invites u to an event and he wants to also be there?
