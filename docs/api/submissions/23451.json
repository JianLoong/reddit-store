My wife\u2019s and I priority was the twins relationship. They did have a good relationship before, and its changed a lot.\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk to him at the same time, my wife talked to him first, about family therapy, and how he couldn\u2019t put any effort in his relationship with Jane, then expect anything from her.\n\nJane the talked to him a little while after. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything from her then. \n2 days ago, they had another talk. Don\u2019t know what was said, but it was enough for John to accept family therapy with her. He\u2019s just made it clear he still doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, and for her to never bring me up around him.\n\nJane has been much more happier now. \n\nThey\u2019re out to watch Barbie and Oppenheimer as i\u2019m typing this.", "created_utc": 1690682167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d98lp/update_aita_for_telling_my_step_son_he_shouldnt/", "score": 202, "replies": ["[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154wmop/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_he_shouldnt_have_been/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "Wut happens when she invites u to an event and he wants to also be there?

Best of luck with all of it.", "You have taught to twins a good thing.\n\nThey need to treat each other as equals and TALK.\n\nThey may not agree, but they learn to HEAR from one another and have empathy, compassion for one another.  that is a wonderful lesson they have learned.", "As long as your daughter is happy, that\u2019s the most important as a father, but man, I hope the brother will get over himself sooner than later. Dude seriously needs to loosen up.", "Prepare for another AITA post", "Especially when the day comes that Jane wants both OP and John at an event. I hope John will eventually accept OP atleast enough to make his mother and sister not have to choose between the two of them for any events.", "A reasonable solution.", "Why would you expect that day ever to come? That is not even the goal of their therapy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I hope John will eventually accept OP atleast enough to make his mother and sister not have to choose between the two of them for any events.\" .. the muich more reasonable outcome is that the twins will have a discussion about who will come (OP, or the son) without damage to THEIR relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes not sound like the relationship between OP and son IS salvageable, or that anybody is trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nall of this sounds like: Accepting that the twins can have a relationship while OP and son do not and won't be in the same room."]}
