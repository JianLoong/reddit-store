Handwritten note in the crib, \"Morning, Babe! I've got baby, go back to bed. I love you.\"", "Post-Its on the bathroom mirror or her phone.\nNAH, but you scared the shit out of her. New parent mistakes. This was out of love", "YTA. Not for taking her but for not telling your wife that you were taking her. I understand you not wanting to wake your wife but you could have left a note for her", "Gentle YTA.\n\nNot really an AH, but you should have texted. I would have been extremely panicked to wake up with my child unexpectedly gone and being unable to reach my husband", "NAH it was a mistake, but it wasn't an asshole move at all.", "YTA. Any relaxation she had went out the window when she woke up and the baby was missing. If you were usually at work during that time then of course she would assume someone else took the baby. She would've also blamed herself as the last person to be with the baby and probably debated a million times how to call you about not knowing where your daughter is. You had great intentions but delivery could use improvement.", "NTA.\n\n*But* next time (because there is always a next time) if she's sleeping when you leave to take the kid out, leave a sticky note on her phone letting her know what you're doing, even if she knows ahead of time that you're going.\n\nReally though, this all just a minor bump in the road. You're a good dad, and she's a New Mom\u2122\ufe0f. It's fine.", "Your intentions were pure OP, and your wife was understandably concerned. NAH", "\"Asshole\" seems like a harsh word but yes you were in the wrong so for the sake of voting YTA. Texting or leaving a note (which is silent) is mandatory between parents. What if something happened to you? Like I know that sounds extreme but there's a difference between \"I woke up and they were both gone\" and \"he texted me he was taking her out\" when it comes to an emergency.", "YTA - if she woke up expecting her child to be in the house and she wasn't, she understandably was freaked out.  Even more so that she assumed you were at work. Then you didn't answer the phone.  \n\nNext time leave a note or text her.  It only takes a couple of seconds.", "I would say N A H but I can imagine the sheer terror your wife felt when she woke up and could not find the baby.  That alone makes it YTA, you have to think about these things.  You sound like a good parent, and mistakes happen, but this one was avoidable.  Next time leave a note on the bed before you leave.", "YTA. Yeah, you should have left a note or something for your wife or texted her. Waking up to find your child missing is pretty much a nightmare scenario. However, now you know and I'm pretty sure you aren't going to repeat it.\n\nHowever, the daddy-daughter date sounds adorable!", "NTA. Simpy leave a note.", "YTA.  You had good intentions, but next time, leave a note.", "NAH It was an honest mistake, but your daughter wasn't in danger. I understand your wife's concern, but the reaction seems mild at best. Normally I'd consider post partum, but in this case I think insomnia and unhealthy sleep hygiene is the issue. (Sleep hygiene: the term used to describe good sleep habits.)", "YTA.  You had good intentions, but next time, leave a note.", "She must have been frantic. You could have left her a note. You could have sent her a text or an email. I can't imagine waking up and finding my child gone and not being able to get a hold of the one person who might legitimately have her. Yes, YTA!", "Yeah YTA for not texting or leaving a note. But you are 100% n t a for taking your kid out and doing the daddy daughter stuff. I still do that with my older teen. And it's some of my best moments with her\n  \n\nBut yeah text - hey got the kiddo out early, go back to bed. See you later", "YTA. \n\nCommunicate better next time. Not a huge AH or anything, but pretty much defeated the purpose of letting her relax by doing this. A sticky note or quick text or whatever could have resolved this all before it began.", "NAH. you where trying to do something nice and it was an ascendent on not picking up your phone when she called. just make sure to let her know the night before if you plan on doing something like this so she does not worry.", "INFO - \n\nWhat time of day was this and what do you mean \"I took off from work\"?\n\n\nWere you outside the house, like at work, and you came back into the house and quietly took your daughter while your wife was sleeping, such that she might think it was an abduction?", "Soft yta. Good intentions but I can understand waking up and freaking out that your kid is missing", "NTA. She knew that you and your daughter were together.", "NAH. But for goodness sake leave a note next time.", "Soft YTA good intentions, but you could have sent a timer text letting her know to have a good relaxing morning to herself. Or left a note on her phone. Get her either some flowers or her favorite candy.\n\nEdited to add A for effort.but you fall short with an A- you should probably get her both \ud83d\ude06", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you tell the wife that?  Or would she have woken up thinking that you were at work and that the baby should therefore be asleep in the crib?", "I told her I was taking Friday off from work.
