Any relaxation she had went out the window when she woke up and the baby was missing. If you were usually at work during that time then of course she would assume someone else took the baby.

And if he doesn't I wake up super frazzled and sad and disturbed. Even if he pops out during the day to hit the store I need to be told about his leaving or ill get out the shower and be like where did he go and feel super abandoned and gross and start crying lol. Can't say it's a good look for myself but he at least doesn't do that anymore. I can handle him going to do things without me it's just the shock of not being able to find him.", "Gentle YTA. A note would be nice. You could leave it on top of her phone next time. My husband and I leave notes for each other where we know they will see it.

No where to be found in this house and she cant get ahold of her husband.\n\nI think you got off the hook here considering how scared and angry that would make most parents.", "NAH but seriously people.

This the way.", "YTA\n\nThere are multiple ways you could have communicated with your wife. \n\nBut the biggest AH part is referring to time with your child as a date. It\u2019s creepy and gross. Dates have romantic connotations and applying that to a child and your child is sickening.", "Aww I get why your wife was upset, she obviously panicked when she seen you were both gone and I get why that would be distressing for her but I can't honestly vote you down for that, it was a sweet gesture born out of love. Also, keep up the daddy-daughter dates, sounds like your daughter is lucky to have you both. Take care.\n\nNAH", "Listen, the fear a parent had because what if you went out for the store, friends, work, etc, and actually didn't have the kid.... how long before the toddler finds a pool, dog, car, lake..... trust gut? But your gut says find the baby NOW. Nothing about not knowing where your kids are is relaxing and has been equated to emotional trauma. Always leave a note somewhere they will see. You can simply put a sticky on their phone lol.", "YTA. Good intentions but yeah, you screwed up. You should've have forseen that your wife would be worried about the baby going missing when she woke up and you should've been sure that ringer was on, or at least attempted to text her. No big deal though, just don't do it again.", "Not a big YTA more like a yta. But not a big deal. Everyone is safe, next time send a text before you leave!", "Do you not have paper and a pen or pencil? You could have hand written, I know crazy talk, a note and left it somewhere you know she would have seen it.", "NTA\n\nWhere did your wife think you had both gone?  Kidnapped your own daughter and left the country?  What was her concern?", "As someone who would prolly end up in the same situation as you. Cuz I have piss poor communication, YTA sorta. I mean obv she was worried cuz it's not part of the schedule uk, but still good that you were looking out for her atleast :)", "Super soft YTA. You most definitely are NOT an asshole. It\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re building memories with your child, and sweet that you wanted to make sure your wife was/is getting enough sleep. I\u2019d venture a guess that you were having a little bit of tunnel vision. Didn\u2019t want to wake wife, didn\u2019t want to text and have a ping wake her, and so focused on being quiet that pen and paper didn\u2019t even come to mind.  Just go get some post-it notes, so you have something you can leave on the bathroom mirror, fridge, front door, wherever, so that the next time, it\u2019s a non-issue.", "NAH. You didnt do this maliciously, but she also has a right to be upset because ive been in a moment where my toddler suddenly disappears from sight after I grabbed something off a shelf and I felt panicky lol", "Imagine the sheer panic of getting up and not being able to find your baby and your husband not responding to your texts or calls. I feel panicky for her just thinking about it.  I guarantee she thought her baby had been stolen/ kidnapped and murdered within the first  2 minutes of not being able to find her. \n\nNo, you're not an AH, because I don't believe you intentionally scared your wife to death.

You're probably almost as tired as your wife, and it's easy to forget to leave a note, especially when you had it in your mind that a text might wake her. It sounds like a bit of a brain fart.

If your wife is a SAHM she is not exhausted from looking after a child who is just between 12-15 months. Children that age usually sleep all night, eat regular food and still have naps.
