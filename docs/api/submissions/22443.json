New parent mistakes. This was out of love", "YTA. Not for taking her but for not telling your wife that you were taking her. I understand you not wanting to wake your wife but you could have left a note for her", "Gentle YTA.\n\nNot really an AH, but you should have texted. I would have been extremely panicked to wake up with my child unexpectedly gone and being unable to reach my husband", "NAH it was a mistake, but it wasn't an asshole move at all.", "YTA. Any relaxation she had went out the window when she woke up and the baby was missing. If you were usually at work during that time then of course she would assume someone else took the baby. She would've also blamed herself as the last person to be with the baby and probably debated a million times how to call you about not knowing where your daughter is. You had great intentions but delivery could use improvement.", "NTA.\n\n*But* next time (because there is always a next time) if she's sleeping when you leave to take the kid out, leave a sticky note on her phone letting her know what you're doing, even if she knows ahead of time that you're going.\n\nReally though, this all just a minor bump in the road. You're a good dad, and she's a New Mom\u2122\ufe0f. It's fine.", "Your intentions were pure OP, and your wife was understandably concerned. NAH", "\"Asshole\" seems like a harsh word but yes you were in the wrong so for the sake of voting YTA. Texting or leaving a note (which is silent) is mandatory between parents. What if something happened to you? Like I know that sounds extreme but there's a difference between \"I woke up and they were both gone\" and \"he texted me he was taking her out\" when it comes to an emergency.", "YTA - if she woke up expecting her child to be in the house and she wasn't, she understandably was freaked out.  Even more so that she assumed you were at work. Then you didn't answer the phone.  \n\nNext time leave a note or text her.  It only takes a couple of seconds.", "I would say N A H but I can imagine the sheer terror your wife felt when she woke up and could not find the baby.  That alone makes it YTA, you have to think about these things.  You sound like a good parent, and mistakes happen, but this one was avoidable.  Next time leave a note on the bed before you leave.", "YTA. Yeah, you should have left a note or something for your wife or texted her. Waking up to find your child missing is pretty much a nightmare scenario. However, now you know and I'm pretty sure you aren't going to repeat it.\n\nHowever, the daddy-daughter date sounds adorable!", "NTA. Simpy leave a note.", "YTA.  You had good intentions, but next time, leave a note.", "NAH It was an honest mistake, but your daughter wasn't in danger. I understand your wife's concern, but the reaction seems mild at best. Normally I'd consider post partum, but in this case I think insomnia and unhealthy sleep hygiene is the issue. (Sleep hygiene: the term used to describe good sleep habits.)", "YTA.  You had good intentions, but next time, leave a note.", "She must have been frantic. You could have left her a note. You could have sent her a text or an email. I can't imagine waking up and finding my child gone and not being able to get a hold of the one person who might legitimately have her. Yes, YTA!", "Yeah YTA for not texting or leaving a note. But you are 100% n t a for taking your kid out and doing the daddy daughter stuff. I still do that with my older teen. And it's some of my best moments with her\n  \n\nBut yeah text - hey got the kiddo out early, go back to bed. See you later", "YTA. \n\nCommunicate better next time. Not a huge AH or anything, but pretty much defeated the purpose of letting her relax by doing this. A sticky note or quick text or whatever could have resolved this all before it began.", "NAH. you where trying to do something nice and it was an ascendent on not picking up your phone when she called. just make sure to let her know the night before if you plan on doing something like this so she does not worry.", "INFO - \n\nWhat time of day was this and what do you mean \"I took off from work\"?\n\n\nWere you outside the house, like at work, and you came back into the house and quietly took your daughter while your wife was sleeping, such that she might think it was an abduction?", "Soft yta.

I have one son (now 30) and 4 daughters (23,19, 16, 15). Many dads focus on their sons and \"forget\" about their daughters. It's super important that you spend time with your girls growing up (at least if you aren't a shit Dad) so they can have a positive male role model and learn how a man is supposed to act. Also super important so they learn to trust you and can come to you if they have \"man type\" questions.", "YTA. She woke up and the baby was missing.

And if he doesn't I wake up super frazzled and sad and disturbed. Even if he pops out during the day to hit the store I need to be told about his leaving or ill get out the shower and be like where did he go and feel super abandoned and gross and start crying lol. Can't say it's a good look for myself but he at least doesn't do that anymore. I can handle him going to do things without me it's just the shock of not being able to find him.", "Gentle YTA. A note would be nice. You could leave it on top of her phone next time. My husband and I leave notes for each other where we know they will see it. I.e. he leaves mine by the coffee pot, I leave his where he sits in the morning. Then there's no panic of \"omg where is everyone?!\" Lesson learned, say sorry, leave notes next time :)", "Yta. Should\u2019ve told your wife. But also a lighttttt Yta. Really just a forgetful moment. You sound like a great father and I hope you keep up with your daddy-daughter dates!", "Not really the AH, I would have assumed that as you don\u2019t work Friday\u2019s or she wouldn\u2019t still be in bed sleeping with a toddler in the house during the day time that you had taken your child out to let her rest, but a note would have been the best thing to do", "Yta\n\nSo to her she wakes up and her baby is GONE. No where to be found in this house and she cant get ahold of her husband.\n\nI think you got off the hook here considering how scared and angry that would make most parents.", "NAH but seriously people. Is it panic worthy to wake up and find your child gone and presumably with your spouse? Annoying that she couldn't get ahold of him, but good God this is not an asshole move. \nThe world previously functioned without cell phones", "Ok, I\u2019m baffled why you needed to post here? \n\n> I didn\u2019t text my wife which I realize now wasn\u2019t a good idea\n\n> She said while she understood and appreciated the gesture, I should\u2019ve at least texted her to let her know that we were gone. \n\n\nSo what further reinforcement do you need that you are in the wrong here? Is she still mad at you? Is she calling you an asshole? Is she on Reddit asking if you\u2019re TA?\n\n\nLike, what is going on? You made a mistake, you KNOW you made a mistake, she TOLD you what the mistake was, but you need ask if you\u2019re the TA?", "Asshole is a bit strong, imo. Notes. Simple gesture and apology. This the way.", "YTA\n\nThere are multiple ways you could have communicated with your wife. \n\nBut the biggest AH part is referring to time with your child as a date. It\u2019s creepy and gross. Dates have romantic connotations and applying that to a child and your child is sickening.", "Aww I get why your wife was upset, she obviously panicked when she seen you were both gone and I get why that would be distressing for her but I can't honestly vote you down for that, it was a sweet gesture born out of love. Also, keep up the daddy-daughter dates, sounds like your daughter is lucky to have you both. Take care.\n\nNAH", "Listen, the fear a parent had because what if you went out for the store, friends, work, etc, and actually didn't have the kid.... how long before the toddler finds a pool, dog, car, lake..... trust gut? But your gut says find the baby NOW. Nothing about not knowing where your kids are is relaxing and has been equated to emotional trauma. Always leave a note somewhere they will see. You can simply put a sticky on their phone lol.", "YTA. Good intentions but yeah, you screwed up. You should've have forseen that your wife would be worried about the baby going missing when she woke up and you should've been sure that ringer was on, or at least attempted to text her. No big deal though, just don't do it again.", "Not a big YTA more like a yta. But not a big deal. Everyone is safe, next time send a text before you leave!", "Do you not have paper and a pen or pencil? You could have hand written, I know crazy talk, a note and left it somewhere you know she would have seen it.", "NTA\n\nWhere did your wife think you had both gone?  Kidnapped your own daughter and left the country?  What was her concern?", "As someone who would prolly end up in the same situation as you. Cuz I have piss poor communication, YTA sorta. I mean obv she was worried cuz it's not part of the schedule uk, but still good that you were looking out for her atleast :)", "Super soft YTA. You most definitely are NOT an asshole. It\u2019s lovely that you\u2019re building memories with your child, and sweet that you wanted to make sure your wife was/is getting enough sleep. I\u2019d venture a guess that you were having a little bit of tunnel vision. Didn\u2019t want to wake wife, didn\u2019t want to text and have a ping wake her, and so focused on being quiet that pen and paper didn\u2019t even come to mind.  Just go get some post-it notes, so you have something you can leave on the bathroom mirror, fridge, front door, wherever, so that the next time, it\u2019s a non-issue.", "NAH. You didnt do this maliciously, but she also has a right to be upset because ive been in a moment where my toddler suddenly disappears from sight after I grabbed something off a shelf and I felt panicky lol", "Imagine the sheer panic of getting up and not being able to find your baby and your husband not responding to your texts or calls. I feel panicky for her just thinking about it.  I guarantee she thought her baby had been stolen/ kidnapped and murdered within the first  2 minutes of not being able to find her. \n\nNo, you're not an AH, because I don't believe you intentionally scared your wife to death.  Your intentions were awesome, but execution was terrible. Apologize and promise to never do that to her again.", "Way to go on your weekly date tradition. Sleep for your wife is wonderful, as is time with your daughter. NTA, just remember to text or note from now on. \nTIP: We're not good at finding paper notes here, so we use a dry erase marker on the bathroom mirror.", "NTA , but dude you almost give her a heart attack instead of letting her relax if that was your main goal \ud83e\udd23 at least a note saying babe I took the baby go to sleep", "NAH - your wife is tight though, you should have texted.", "NTA. You're probably almost as tired as your wife, and it's easy to forget to leave a note, especially when you had it in your mind that a text might wake her. It sounds like a bit of a brain fart.

It's hardly a punishable offence.", "Alternative: Stop being a weirdo that cannot separate a word with multiple meanings from the sexual/romantic definition even when its clear by the context.", "Yeah. I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so far to see this. It\u2019s disgusting.", "I think AH is an inappropriate label, but I think this sub is meant to distinguish who's right/wrong.\n\nI think OP is a super awesome dad and totally not a genuine AH; but he is at fault for making the mom panic thinking the daughter got kidnapped (especially not picking up the first two calls).
