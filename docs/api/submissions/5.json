I was hoping to get another woman to live with but Pete was the only one to reply to the ad.\n\nHe seemed sane and somewhat pleasant so after meeting him twice, I agreed that he could move in.\n\nSo far, everything has been fine. I did lock my bedroom door at night at first but he seemed safe enough. He went back to college recently (we're both in our thirties) to study computer science and is now on some sort of work placement (hence the need for the room here). All he seems to do is write computer code - he doesn't go out, doesn't bring people back, doesn't seem to have a life outside of his studies. Which is fine.\n\nI was discussing his quietness with a group of friends recently and one of them realised that he dated a friend of hers. I got her number to find out more about him (and if he really is as safe to live with as he seems).\n\nHe checked out. His ex said that he is a very decent man, but keeps to himself for the most part. She said that the only weird thing about him is that he has a foot fetish - that's it.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about this. I'm **always** barefoot at home. I'm concerned that I could be facilitating or playing into something sexual for him. Maybe it's because I'm looking for it, but I think I've even seen him looking at my feet recently on a couple of occasions.\n\nI don't want to change how I am in my own apartment - I'd find it uncomfortable to wear shoes or anything similar at home. I'm tempted to ask him to leave (he's not strictly a tenant as I own the apartment - there's also no lease) but I have to concede that he hasn't actually taken any action to make me feel unsafe.\n\nThat said, I really don't want to have to wear shoes in my own home and I don't want to be sexually exciting him.\n\nWIBTA for asking him to leave?", "created_utc": 1673736132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c2xfy/wibta_for_asking_someone_to_move_out_because_of/", "score": 1936, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
