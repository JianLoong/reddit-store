{"id": 5, "submission_id": "yin7pf", "title": "AITA for wanting to meet my \"daughter\" after giving up my parental rights?", "selftext": "Long story short: in my (40f) twenties I had a one night stand with this guy \"Nathan\" (now 41m) and got pregnant. I first thought of having an abortion, but Nathan had come from a conservative religious background (not Christian) and wanted the baby so we made a deal: I would give birth to the child and sign away my parental rights (my name is not even in her birth certificate, it's a possibility in my country) and he would pay all the medical expenses plus some extra for my troubles. That's what we did and didn't keep contact after his daughter was born.\n\nA few weeks ago, a friend of mine who has the same religion as Nathan sent me a post from her temple's youth group (they were asking for donations for the homeless) and one of the girls from the picture looked a lot like me. I searched for her profile and found out that she had Nathan's surname and had the right age to be the baby I gave away. She's 17 now and seems to be doing fine: she is involved in charity work, apparently loves music and has lots of pictures with friends and family (Nathan, his wife and half-siblings).\n\nI never wanted nor want to be a mother but I became curious to know more about this human I put in the world, so I texted Nathan's old phone number, which he has not changed, and asked if he would allow me to meet his daughter, since I gave birth to her and everything, and made my intentions clear: I do not want to interfere with his family, just to know her. He then wrote a long text which comes down to the fact that I am an asshole for wanting to know his daughter now after I \"abandoned\" her and that this meeting would only mess up with her head. I told him I was telling him out of courtesy because soon the girl will be an adult and be able to choose herself if she wants to meet me. He then blocked me.\n\nAm I being the asshole here? I don't think there is any harm in meeting my \"daughter\"; she already has a great family and it would only be beneficial to her to know about her own history. But maybe I am not seeing the full picture.\n\nAlso sorry for any mistakes or weird phrases, English is not my first language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE\n\nHi everyone. First of all, thank you for your judgement. Some of you were were pretty harsh and a bit misogynistic to be honest, but I needed to hear what the well-intentioned comments had to say. Some answers to common assumptions:\n\n 1. I wasn\u2019t coherced into giving birth.  Nathan and I reached an agreement in a situation that involved us both. I\u2019ll admit that I was young, didn\u2019t know what pregnancy was really like and needed the money (which I\u2019m not proud of but hey y\u2019all are gonna judge me anyway).\n\n2. I didn\u2019t want to reach out to Nathan\u2019s daughter just because she looks like me. I only mentioned it because this is what made me realize that the girl on the picture was the child I gave birth to, but it blew out of proportion. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know why some people assumed Nathan is Christian and why they were judging him for being religious. He is Jewish and I am agnostic myself but don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem for him to have a strong bond with his religion. The one night stand happened when we were very young and I don\u2019t know what his views are about that, but it doesn\u2019t matter. His daughter apparently is very attached to their community and it\u2019s important to her. Also I might have used the world temple wrong but I\u2019m not Jewish myself. \n\n4. When I said I don\u2019t want to be a mother I didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want a relationship with Nathan's daughter. I am not her mother since I didn\u2019t raise and don\u2019t want to take this place from the person who truly did: his wife. I also chose not to have children of my own.\n\nSo after reading your comments, I came to a better understanding of what my role is in this situation and decided to reach out to his wife through social media to try to make amends. She was very understanding and explained to me that Nathan had a couple of tough years being a single dad before meeting her and me coming back like that made it seem (like some of you pointed out) that I wanted to skip the hard parts and become a parent out of nowhere, which was never my intention. They told their daughter that her birth mother had to go back to her home country and couldn't  take care of her, which was kind. The wife is going to talk to Nathan to leave the door open if their daughter wants to meet me when she\u2019s older and I gave her all my contact information for when and if the time comes. I'll admit I was being a bit selfish here, so that is the best ending I could hope for.

But I will give you my thoughts/advice. \n\n1-don\u2019t contact her until she is an adult since her dad doesn\u2019t want you to. I would maybe wait until she\u2019s graduated high school and has settled into college/a job or whatever else she does post high school. \n\n2-don\u2019t reach out to her without being clear on what your expectations for her are, and what you want from a relationship. If you want to meet her this one time, and then move on with your life as if she doesn\u2019t exist, that would likely do more harm then good to her. Don\u2019t do this for your own selfish reasons. If you want to have a relationship with her (not parent/child relationship, but maybe friends or something), that\u2019s different. But be clear on what you want from her and this meeting. \n\n3-be prepared that she may not want to meet you. Or that she will, but will be angry at you, potentially cry, and overall feel a jumble of emotions. She may not be sure what she wants from you. And that\u2019s ok. You need to let her lead this, because she\u2019s the one that grew up without you due to your decisions. So even though you should know what you want going in to the meeting from her, you need to be prepared to accept what she offers and let her lead the relationship. \n\nReally, just be intentional, and put her first. Don\u2019t be selfish. From the tone of your post, you seem a bit selfish, like you want to meet her because you put her in the world, and not because you think its the right thing to do. and you don\u2019t care about her dads feelings. His feelings may not matter, but keep in mind he probably has her best interests at heart-but do you? Really ask yourself that.", "You gave up your rights as a parent. I would say you did the right thing to do with asking. BUT he has a right to decline and you have to abide with his wishes because you gave up your rights.\n\nNotice that she has a life. And you entering it would upend it. Her relationship with her parents may shatter. She may lose her innocence because she is unwanted by her bio mother.\n\nSo yeah... YTA\n\nAnd please do not enter her life.", "YWBTA if you contact this girl.  You are not the AH for wanting to know more about her or for wanting to meet her, but it isn't your choice now.

If she comes looking for you, fine, but DO NOT seek her out", "YTA. Have you even considered how this would make your daughter feel? That you are only reaching out because you are curious?

May I suggest a passive version of this. My mom put her son up for adoption when she was in medical school, she did not try to find or contact him, out of respect for his parents (THOSE THAT RAISED HIM). However when he turned 21, she put her name in a passive database so that he could find her IF HE WAS LOOKING for her.  He was, and they got to know each other. My mother was always careful that her relationship with her bio son, never impacted his Mom. At his wedding we were guests, and sat with his friends, and let his family sit with him at the main tables and make the speaches. There is a respect that is owed to the person/s that raised your child. Please find a way to show it.", "YWBTA if you reached out, yes. You decided to sever ties and sign away your rights.

It doesn't sound like you suddenly want to be a mother (which WOULD be a dick move) after all this time, so no harm done in asking. However, you did give up your rights upon birth, so it isn't your place to disrespect her (the daughter) or her father's (Nathan) authority since essentially you just aren't her mother aside from DNA. \n\nI think the best solution would be to let the daughter decide, and respect whatever she chooses.

She could have explained how she saw a photo of the daughter, and let him know that she's found herself curious about her, and wanted to talk a bit about her life.  Then at that meeting, OP could have asked Nathan what the daughter does or does not know about her.  She could have asked if Nathan has ever offered the daughter a chance to meet, or what he thought about offering her that either now, or perhaps this summer, so if it's hard on her, she doesn't get distracted in the middle of the school year.  OP could have offered that if the daughter wanted to meet her that they could look into a therapist that specialized in adoption.  The daughter could meet with a couple therapists until she finds one she's comfortable with, and meet the mother in a session, so she can be supported afterwards if it ends up being too emotionally charged for her.\n\nThere are a million ways OP could have approached this to show that she had the daughter's needs on her radar at all, but she didn't.\n\nSo I don't think Nathan is an AH for not doing something we don't even know if he did or not...  nor for reacting in a negative way to the very selfish requests OP was making.", ">NTA, but neither is he\n\nThat's what the judgement N A H is for", "I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't know her mother isn't her birthmother, especially considering they are religious (and there's a lot to say about no abortions but one night stands being okay).", "What constitutes as a good answer?
