{"id": 32352, "submission_id": "18avw1y", "title": "AITA for ratting out my friend's golddigging to her boyfriend?", "selftext": "I'm a male with a female friend whom I've known for about 10  years now. She started dating a new man about 6 years ago and about 3 years ago, they got their own apartment together in a very nice place. Things seemed normal up until about a year ago when my friend asked to borrow $500 from me. She said she was short on her half of the rent and needed help. I agreed so long as she pay me back within 30 days. Well she never paid me back. Instead, it was one excuse after the other; everything from her car breaking down to her family needing emergency help. I eventually gave up and decided to cut my losses. While this is happening, I get to know her boyfriend, who seems to be a very nice and hard working man.\n\nAbout a month ago, she again asks me for money due to being short on rent (and not getting a work bonus she was expecting) but I told her I wasn't willing to based on the last time she borrowed money. She won't take no for an answer and eventually I cave in and lend her $100 (she asked for $800 this time). However, I am confused by her social media postings which shows her out with friends and drinking and eating fancy meals. About two weeks later and I ask her for the $100 back but she doesn't respond. Frustrated, I got to her apartment and only find her boyfriend there. He tells me she went out of the country for a week and is probably asleep due to the time difference. I tell him if he can tell her to call me when she gets back as I am asking for my money back. Her boyfriend is shocked to find out that she owes me money. He says the reason is because he pays for EVERYTHING: rent, utilities, food and her personal bills. He says he does it to help her save her money and get out of debt that I wasn't aware of. I ask him why he would do that and he claims to love her too much. I sit down and with him and he says he has to work two jobs to keep this up. I tell him that despite this, she's not saving her money, if anything, she's getting into more debt. As someone who also once dated and provided for a golddigger, I snapped and told him that she's just using him and that he deserves better than my friend is treating him. He says he has some thinking to do and I leave.\n\nNow fast forward to the other day and my friend angrily calls me. She tells me that her boyfriend has broken up with her and kicked her out of the apartment and now she's forced to moving back in with her parents. I told her what I learned about her and called her out for being s golddigger but she defends herself by saying that she loved him and he was doing it to help her. She's hasn't spoken to me since then but I'm not sure how to feel.\n\nAITA for butting into their relationship and causing their breakup or did I do him a favor by calling her out? I feel bad for ratting her out but also feel like she almost deserved it. I can't be crazy here...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Forgot to mention that he was even offered to pay me back the $600 she owed me himself.

Be glad to be rid of her.", "NTA\u2026if there was no truth to what you were saying he wouldn\u2019t have left her. He knew it, talked himself out of it bc he loves her and you snapped him back into reality.", "NTA.

She was gold digging you in \u201cfriendship\u201d so you didn\u2019t even get the fun part of typical golddigging. You were simply relaying your story to another man she was also golddigging.

Good on you for clueing him in on what she had been doing.\n\nShe doesn't love him, she loves the fact that she could use him. She would have continued with her behavior if you hadn't said anything to him. She's angry that she's lost her ATM and is taking it out on you.\n\nGiven the amount of time that's past and the nature of her lies, they were probably at the point where he would get suspicious. If she had taken any more money, he probably would have started asking questions but didn't want to cut back on her lifestyle, so she decided to start mooching off of her friends(you). Heck, you're probably not the only one she's borrowed money from. It's been a number of years. If she had been truthful and really was working on reducing her debt with an action plan, she should've had a good chunk of it paid off by now.\n\nIt might feel as though you've lost a friend, but was she really a friend to you?

How did you know she's just using him? Maybe you're not telling the whole story but as it stands it sounds like you made big impact statements based on nothing. She might have a spending addiction, she might have all sorts of issues and still love him. \n\nYou might also be right but you clearly overstepped your position, sorry. You didn't even ask yourself what problem she might have, didn't give a person you call a  friend for 10 years any benefit of the doubt. You feel bad because you know you've been a sucky friend and selfish when you said that", "NTA - just about.  She got her comeuppance by you and her bf comparing notes.

Don\u2019t lend friends money unless you are ok to not get it back. Something is obviously going on and as her friend you should give her the benefit of the doubt and talk to her more.

Only slight TA but I think you could have just answered the BF\u2019s questions and then left. And you don\u2019t have any position to judge her on being a gold digger as such. All you can judge her on is being a shitty friend and financially reckless with other people\u2019s money, because that is where you are involved personally.\n\nEither way, she is facing the consequences of her own actions and you should be thankful to get her out of your life. If you can get the money back from her without letting her forcing you into lending again, try it.", "Dude, she ain't your friend.
