{"id": 14520, "submission_id": "12if5td", "title": "AITA for installing a lock on my skincare fridge because my roommate won't stop taking my stuff", "selftext": "Throwaway. So I (17f) am in my first year of college and I share the college hostel room with Sia (18f). We are very different people so while we have a cordial relationship and get along well, I wouldn't say we're the best of friends. \n\nSo the problem is, I used to have super oily skin so I started using skincare from some dermatology brands. In my country, those are crazy expensive. Now I work a part time job that pays not a lot, but enough for a college student who has her basic utilities covered. Tbf my sister sends me a good amount of pocket money every month so I don't really need to work but I'm just doing it for experience and to open up as I used to have anxiety in the past. So after covering some basic costs (books, lab equipment once in a while) I pretty much have enough to be able to afford my skincare. \n\nWhen I moved here, my family gifted me a 12L double door fridge to keep my skincare in because there was no way I could have managed all those tubes and spray bottles given we had just one, matchbox sized cupboard in our room which barely contained mine and Sia's clothes. So this is where I keep all of my skincare, cosmetics and bathing products. \n\nRecently, I started noticing that my face creams and lotions would be used up earlier than expected and Sia's clothing started to smell like my peach body mist. Our class timings are different, she leaves after me so I asked her if she had been taking stuff from my fridge and she said sometimes. I politely asked her not to and she agreed, I thought that was the end. A week later, the body butter I haven't even started using is almost used up, there was less than half remaining in the tube. I understood that asking her to stop wasn't enough so I took my fridge to a hardware store (idk what to call it?) to see if I could get a lock on it. I picked it up a week later during which Sia asked me a few times where my fridge was and I just told her some bullshit about it malfunctioning. \n\nSo my fridge now has some kind of a magnetic combination lock lodged between the doors and ofcourse, I'm the only one who knows the combination. Sia tried to ask me what the combination was, like \"Hey I ran out of lotion can I take yours what's the code?\" and everytime, I just got the product from my fridge and gave it to her. Today she lost it and started going off at me about how terrible I was for not trusting her and that nothing about my stupid fridge was so special that anyone would try to steal from it. I just kept on insisting that I could do whatever I want with my fridge and now she isn't talking to me. She was also making passive aggressive comments about mistrustful people to someone on her phone.

I also have a bottle of a discontinued Benetton perfume that my sister found in a Macy's in NYC. She sent that and tons of little bottles of other Benetton fragrances to me for my bday. Guess who would use it to work? She knew we had a hard time with money, harder than her, and that the perfume had sentimental value.))\n\n^(When we pointed it out she got all offended about it and threw a hissy fit; it was one of the reasons we're not friends anymore.

Do you really think confronting her will shut her down or would it push her to escalate her behavior to maybe stealing more important things like clothes or jewelry? \n\nOp is NTA, but maybe she needs more locked bins for her personal things, to stop sharing with this greedy theif, and start looking for new lodging.", "You're right, its definitely not the most important thing to be spending money on and I make my products last like a month and a half before replacing them.

Just because Sia\u2019s bad behavior may escalate is not a reason for OP to withdraw from confrontation, because that passively give Sia the ability to take further advantage.
