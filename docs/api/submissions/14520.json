{"id": 14520, "submission_id": "12if5td", "title": "AITA for installing a lock on my skincare fridge because my roommate won't stop taking my stuff", "selftext": "Throwaway. So I (17f) am in my first year of college and I share the college hostel room with Sia (18f). We are very different people so while we have a cordial relationship and get along well, I wouldn't say we're the best of friends. \n\nSo the problem is, I used to have super oily skin so I started using skincare from some dermatology brands. In my country, those are crazy expensive. Now I work a part time job that pays not a lot, but enough for a college student who has her basic utilities covered. Tbf my sister sends me a good amount of pocket money every month so I don't really need to work but I'm just doing it for experience and to open up as I used to have anxiety in the past. So after covering some basic costs (books, lab equipment once in a while) I pretty much have enough to be able to afford my skincare. \n\nWhen I moved here, my family gifted me a 12L double door fridge to keep my skincare in because there was no way I could have managed all those tubes and spray bottles given we had just one, matchbox sized cupboard in our room which barely contained mine and Sia's clothes. So this is where I keep all of my skincare, cosmetics and bathing products. \n\nRecently, I started noticing that my face creams and lotions would be used up earlier than expected and Sia's clothing started to smell like my peach body mist. Our class timings are different, she leaves after me so I asked her if she had been taking stuff from my fridge and she said sometimes. I politely asked her not to and she agreed, I thought that was the end. A week later, the body butter I haven't even started using is almost used up, there was less than half remaining in the tube. I understood that asking her to stop wasn't enough so I took my fridge to a hardware store (idk what to call it?) to see if I could get a lock on it. I picked it up a week later during which Sia asked me a few times where my fridge was and I just told her some bullshit about it malfunctioning. \n\nSo my fridge now has some kind of a magnetic combination lock lodged between the doors and ofcourse, I'm the only one who knows the combination. Sia tried to ask me what the combination was, like \"Hey I ran out of lotion can I take yours what's the code?\" and everytime, I just got the product from my fridge and gave it to her. Today she lost it and started going off at me about how terrible I was for not trusting her and that nothing about my stupid fridge was so special that anyone would try to steal from it. I just kept on insisting that I could do whatever I want with my fridge and now she isn't talking to me. She was also making passive aggressive comments about mistrustful people to someone on her phone.

She refused.", "NTA shitty roommates are the worst", "NTA.  Why would you trust her when she has proven herself to be untrustworthy?", "NTA, you're under no obligation to share anything with anyone in your dorm.", "I dont even need to read to know you are NOT THE ASSHOLE. Skincare can be expensive! Also have to think of hygiene as well. If the products are in pots then other peoples hands and germs going in is a no no! Also (after reading) her saying she did use the products and then just continued using it, is not cool. \n\nId make her pay for the items she has used/ replace them WITH THE SAME BRAND not a different one.", "Holy shit, NTA!\n\n\"Your fridge is so stupid, no one would want to steal from it.

You asked her not to, she kept doing it.  So you did what you had to do.  You have a right to have boundaries.", "nta, you have every right to lock up your things especially after you told her to stay out of it and she did not respect your wishes.   In fact, it's sad that you can't trust your roommate and had to go and have a lock installed.", "NTA!!! That is so rude of her to do to you. And honestly we don\u2019t know where her hands have been and skin is so fragile sometimes she could be making yours worse. She needs to have so boundaries who knows what else she\u2019s getting into.", "She was stealing from you, and now she cannot. Your items are yours.

Sorry you had to go that far to get her to stop.", "NTA. \n\nI had a roommate in college who got pissed about me watching her DVDs. Since it was my TV, I hid the remote control. I can't watch your movies? Fine. Neither can you. \n\nYou were 100% in the right to lock it. If possible, start looking for a new roommate. This entitled nonsense is ridiculous. Just because you live there doesn't mean it's yours or that you can use it. You told her to stop. She outed herself by asking to use more. That's theft. In the simplest terms. She's stealing your product.", "She's not a friend and not a good roommate, NTA, hopefully you can move next semester.", "NTA, she don't pay, she gets no say. Honestly I wouldn't let her use anything until she pays you back for all the stuff she's used.", "NTA. And stop loaning stuff to an ungrateful roommate.

Sia is the AH.", "NTA, I would be mistrustful of people that kept stealing my stuff too. Especially roommates. Wtf Sia.", "Nta, and she can\u2019t be trusted. Tell her that you can\u2019t and don\u2019t trust her. Her passive aggressive bullshit isn\u2019t helping her case. Don\u2019t make up stories but just tell her that your stuff is very expensive and you can\u2019t support her and you using the stuff. If she didn\u2019t steal your stuff she would be trusted. Easy as that. Good luck.", "NTA.  Even after you asked her not to use your lotions, etc., she continued to steal from you.  Sounds like baby is having a tantrum.  Mistrustful?  You bet!  She is a thief!  Keep your valuables locked, everything password protected & get a new roommate next year.", "One of my roommates in college would use my makeup, which is super unhygienic. Eventually, I replaced it, hid it, and I just let her keep using the decoy makeup.", "NTA. Thieving thieves need to stop with the thievery.", "NTA. Your roommate is a thief.", "Tell her to pay you back for the amount she\u2019s used and will use and maybe you\u2019ll give her the combo.", "You need to be tougher because she\u2019s stealing from you.", "NTA.  And if it were truly about being trustworthy, your roommate would never have known you had a lock on a fridge that she has no business being in.\n\nAsk for a new roommate/room.  Explain it is due to theft.", "Very clear NTA. You are never the asshole for preventing someone for stealing your things. She\u2019s out of line. While it\u2019s good that you\u2019re able to get along in general, she is very much in the wrong here and the fact she\u2019s being passive aggressive after being called out on her inappropriate behavior does not bode well for the future. \n\nSince you are staying in the dorms, you might be able to get some assistance from your resident advisor if you have one, or from campus housing officials if not.

Classic.", "Girl get a new roommate NTA at all protect your belongings", "If the contents of your fridge are not so special, and nobody is interested in stealing them, then why does it matter to her that there is a lock on the fridge?
