{"id": 14520, "submission_id": "12if5td", "title": "AITA for installing a lock on my skincare fridge because my roommate won't stop taking my stuff", "selftext": "Throwaway. So I (17f) am in my first year of college and I share the college hostel room with Sia (18f). We are very different people so while we have a cordial relationship and get along well, I wouldn't say we're the best of friends. \n\nSo the problem is, I used to have super oily skin so I started using skincare from some dermatology brands. In my country, those are crazy expensive. Now I work a part time job that pays not a lot, but enough for a college student who has her basic utilities covered. Tbf my sister sends me a good amount of pocket money every month so I don't really need to work but I'm just doing it for experience and to open up as I used to have anxiety in the past. So after covering some basic costs (books, lab equipment once in a while) I pretty much have enough to be able to afford my skincare. \n\nWhen I moved here, my family gifted me a 12L double door fridge to keep my skincare in because there was no way I could have managed all those tubes and spray bottles given we had just one, matchbox sized cupboard in our room which barely contained mine and Sia's clothes. So this is where I keep all of my skincare, cosmetics and bathing products. \n\nRecently, I started noticing that my face creams and lotions would be used up earlier than expected and Sia's clothing started to smell like my peach body mist. Our class timings are different, she leaves after me so I asked her if she had been taking stuff from my fridge and she said sometimes. I politely asked her not to and she agreed, I thought that was the end. A week later, the body butter I haven't even started using is almost used up, there was less than half remaining in the tube. I understood that asking her to stop wasn't enough so I took my fridge to a hardware store (idk what to call it?) to see if I could get a lock on it. I picked it up a week later during which Sia asked me a few times where my fridge was and I just told her some bullshit about it malfunctioning. \n\nSo my fridge now has some kind of a magnetic combination lock lodged between the doors and ofcourse, I'm the only one who knows the combination. Sia tried to ask me what the combination was, like \"Hey I ran out of lotion can I take yours what's the code?\" and everytime, I just got the product from my fridge and gave it to her. Today she lost it and started going off at me about how terrible I was for not trusting her and that nothing about my stupid fridge was so special that anyone would try to steal from it. I just kept on insisting that I could do whatever I want with my fridge and now she isn't talking to me. She was also making passive aggressive comments about mistrustful people to someone on her phone.

But we ask before borrowing creams and always use a clean spatula. I never use her blenders or blending tools, I feel like those are a bit too personal for some reason.", "Google it before commenting. Manipulative behavior meant to convince you that you were in the wrong and what you think is happening isn't, is absolutely gaslighting and the entire fact that OP is here asking if SHE is the asshole shows its working. \n\nTry knowing what you're talking about before commenting.", "Mine was a roommate who insisted we were the same size (I\u2019m a size 4 and she was about a size 12) and would stretch out/rip/ruin my clothes, which were also nicer/more expensive than hers. I literally started keeping my nicer items in a different friends dorm room it was so bad", "One day in college I was drinking a Gatorade at my desk after a grueling track practice + weight room session, and my roommate came in and just\u2026 took my Gatorade. Grabbed it. Said \u201cI want some\u201d and grabbed my open bottle of Gatorade and took a big swig. I just started at her, completely aghast.", "[removed]", "Oh my gosh, yes. I had a NASTY roommate in college. Like think sleeping naked on the couch even during \"that time\" of the month with no tampon in; smoke inside despite me asking her not to and then putting them out in water bottles that she would leave sitting open with no tops; and go into my room and borrow my clothes without asking even though she weighed like 30 pounds more, stretching the clothes out, kind of nasty.\n\nThanks to her I also learned that if you leave a jar of nacho cheese in the cupboard long enough, it will separate into layers. \n\nI got mono and had to recover at home for 5 weeks in the summer. I returned to find she also left the apt during this time but left unwashed dirty dishes and food out. The smell was ATROCIOUS when I got back. I spent 3 days straight cleaning, almost vomiting as I washed her moldy dishes, it was that bad. I was still weak so the cleaning took it out of me. Within 3 days of her return, it was messy again. \n\nScrew you, Bekah. I hope your life is miserable.", "I agree op should stand up for herself, but all I'm saying- I guess poorly- is based on sia's already atrocious behavior op should take precautions to secure the safety of her belongings before putting her foot down. That's all.", "You should not share eyeshadow, that's very unhygienic", "Downvote and report. /u/Ok_Caterpillar_8950  is a bot and stole this partial comment from /u/amberallday", "Oh-no worries. I understood that, and I agree. I just wanted to expand on it.", "Nah we are good. We both spritz our palettes with rubbing alcohol between uses and wipe them down. We also never share brushes or spatulas. Barring that we have a mini spa autoclave to clean tools like nail clippers, scissors, tweezers, whatever. \n\nWe are both super fastidious. Especially her, her entirely background is surgical pathology.", "she gave the mouse free access to those warm milk chocolate chip cookies and then all of a sudden got so pissed off that she couldnt eat all dozen cookies and immediately locked them up. thats so petty cmon. sit down with her. talk to the mouse. maybe split the cost. OP never even attempted that. she just got petty and locked them up. the roommate is in desperate need of those creamy body lotions to lather up her oily skin. yall wild fr.", "in my defense, its now apparent that this is in fact not r/circlejerk. either way i still agree with my argument. OP is unbelievably petty.", "This commenter was tripping, but truly stop sharing with your roomate op. You have been way to generous with someone who is not deserving of it. NTA of course", "Don\u2019t worry Op the commenter is also a thief or the roommate. It\u2019s not your responsibility to care for her in anyway shape or form", "That's great! I've heard too many horror stories, even about so-called professionals.", "I don't want to split the cost with her or reach a compromise! These are my products that I brought and I wanna be the one to use them, its as simple as that. Yes I left my fridge unattended in the beginning because I thought just like I never mess with her stuff, she wouldn't mess with mine. And anyway, if I do attempt that splitting the cost thing, there's no way in hell she's gonna pay. She doesn't even pay for her takeout when I order lol\n\nAnd whats up with your description of the lotion? 'Thick creamy, oil fighting' like lol dude", "Yeah not in my house. I actually don't trust most MUAs around me because I've seen how they work and clean their surfaces (which is not much if at all). \n\nIf it's going on someone's skin it better be clean. You don't mess with that.", "then why tf would you share with her in the first place if you know shes stingy. you sound like a toddler \u201ci dont want to be a grown up and resolve things in an adult way by talking through issues. id rather be petty and cry on the internet for karma and self confirmation.\u201d grow tf up. you shared your luscious lotions and creamy face creams and now youve gotten yourself in this pickle.", "Your arguments sound like, \"A criminal is going to commit crimes, why are *you* not careful enough? Now if you'll take your body outside, then ofcourse the criminal is gonna cut it up.\" you need to grow tf up lol", "how is it a crime if you openly shared the creamy creams with her? now all of a sudden you realize you dont have the financial stability to help her with her oily skin condition and instead if telling her that, you just lock them. its petty. youre petty. sit down and tell her. youre not giving her a chance to change. you just lock the cookie jar all of a sudden. of course shes gonna get pissed, now her skin wont be all smooth and moisturized."]}
