I\u2019m not going to lose sleep over it.\u201d He\u2019s saying it is not a priority for him at all to get my name right, because the difference isn\u2019t important to him.\n\nMy reaction when he does it is just kind of sad or miffed facial expression, I don\u2019t throw a fit or anything, and he catches it himself and comments on it himself. So I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m forcing him to get super defensive.

He notices when he does it, started out saying he didn\u2019t know why he was doing it, and I was like yeah I don\u2019t love it when you do that. So he knows it bothers me. \n\nBut it\u2019s continuing to happen and now his response is \u201cyeah it\u2019s not a big deal at all, Kelsey is way more of a common name than Kelly so it\u2019s just a slip of the tongue. I\u2019m not going to lose sleep over it.\u201d He\u2019s saying it is not a priority for him at all to get my name right, because the difference isn\u2019t important to him.\n\nMy reaction when he does it is just kind of sad or miffed facial expression, I don\u2019t throw a fit or anything, and he catches it himself and comments on it himself. So I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m forcing him to get super defensive. He\u2019s young, no health or memory problems, etc. \n\nIt just feels like a bummer when the guy you\u2019re spending so much time with and into doesn\u2019t care to make sure he\u2019s getting your name right.... am I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
