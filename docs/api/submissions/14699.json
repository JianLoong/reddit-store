My brother Kyle (M 23) has been saying he is allergic to gluten for the past 2 years and I think it is for attention.\n\nLet me preface by saying this all started about 2 years ago after my grandmother died. She was very loved and our family still grieves to this day. Shortly after she passed Kyle became very \u201cill\u201d. He complained he had migraines, blurred vision, trouble breathing, you name it.\n\nMy still grieving parents were scared and brought him to every doctor possible and there was nothing wrong with him. He then self diagnosed himself with a gluten allergy. No doctor told him this. Now I would believe him and support him if a dr confirmed it.\n\nAnyone with a gluten allergy will say you can\u2019t have certain drinks, can\u2019t use certain products and eat certain things. Kyle just went gluten free with food. It made me so mad because it was for attention and the rest of us could not properly grieve at the time and all eyes were on him.\n\nLast month was the anniversary of grandmas passing and we had a huge get together with family to remember her. He made a huge deal of pointing out his allergy and say \u201cI can\u2019t eat this it us gluten\u201d to everything. So\u2026I switched some of the gluten free bread out with normal bread and waited to see.\n\nLet me say this, I would never ever have done it if I didn\u2019t know he was faking the allergy. I knew with 100% certainty he wasn\u2019t allergic. I love him but I knew he was lying. So I watched as he ate it and\u2026nothing.\n\nHours later I told him and the family what I\u2019d did and they looked at me like I was a monster. Some of my cousins laughed because they also knew the allergy was fake. My parents were not happy though. I truly think my brother did the fake allergy to get attention though. Almost like no one could grieve but him\u2026so am I really ta and should I be feeling this bad over his lying?", "created_utc": 1681400030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kt2aw/aita_for_exposing_my_brothers_fake_gluten_allergy/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I eat gluten my face and stomach swell and I have stomach pain.  It looks bad, feels uncomfortable, and can take a few days to go away.  The more gluten, the worse it gets.  Beer contains on average ~20 ppm gluten, while white bread, on average, contains 124,000 ppm gluten!  I'm not having trouble breathing, covered in hives, shitting blood, or dying; does that mean I don't have a gluten intolerance?  \n\nLearn to mind your own fucking business, asshole.  You couldn't grieve because your brother stopped eating gluten??  What the hell, get therapy.", "YTA\n\nEven if you were 100% certain it was a lie (which you were not btw), you simply don't fuck with people's food. If they say they don't want to eat the regular bread, you don't feed it to them.

I was having some abdominal/digestive issues and I talked it over with my aunt who has celiac disease. She said, \"That sounds familiar\" so I saw my doctor who tested me for it. My results were at the high end of normal. Now what he said next has stuck with me. He said that the ranges of normal/abnormal for any test is just an average and that all bodies are different. So while my test was still considered \"normal\", I might very well be in the beginning stage of celiac FOR ME. So even though he couldn't give me a definitive diagnosis of celiac, he told me to avoid gluten as much as I could and see what happens. I tell you what my issues improved dramatically. I still slip because I get cocky, but I'm going to listen to what my body tells me.  \n\n\nSo in short, you never, ever mess with someone's food.", "INFO: how are you '100% sure' he's faking it?

And in most cases, you won't see an immediate reaction the minute he eats something with gluten. What you COULD be doing is causing damage to his intestines. \n\nIn the future, please NEVER do this. You literally could've killed someone.", "YTA. There is being allergic to gluten. There is also being gluten sensitive. Gluten sensitivity can cause all the symptoms you described.

Did you try to talk to your parents about how you needed their comfort? Talk to other members of the family about your grief? If you made a genuine effort to reach out and communicate your needs, and they still weren't being met because your brother was being diagnosed, that is *not your brother's fault*. It may not be *anyone's* fault. \n\nBetween your grandmother's death and your brother suddenly becoming ill, your family had a lot on their plate. **It's okay to be upset that they didn't have time for you.** However, the appropriate way to communicate that upset is not to \"expose\" your brother, which could only create drama, upset, and division.", "YTA instead of understanding that everyone grieves differently for different lengths of time you literally went \"I'll potentially poison my bro so no one pays attention to him\". This wasn't about grief, this was about your petty jealousy. If it were about your grandma you would have asked your family to help you through and gone to therapy.", "YTA. You are not an allergy expert yourself, so your limited knowledge is unreliable at best, it's not medical procedure to make contact with a big quantity of a substance the patient may be allergic to (it is done in very small quantities, way smaller than what you thought was ok). \n\nAlso, it feels like you're underestimating  everyone else in your family a lot, maybe people knew about your brother, but didn't care because they understood that this has been your brother's way to cope and thought he would eventually stop.\n\nWhy did you yourself need to expose your brother?  \nHave you considered that you may be craving some of the attention he is getting?\n\nEven when you're right, your methods matter, the end does not justify the means, people were looking at you like that because what you did was reckless and dangerous.", "YTA. You could've made your brother incredibly sick and you rolled those dice to prove a point.

And the gentlest way you could think of to address this was to risk making him extremely sick by feeding him gluten? He needs therapy, not his older sister poisoning him to prove a point.\n\nEdit: and actually that's assuming he even was faking it. Did he actually not get sick at all? Or did he just not get sick enough for your liking? Not every gluten allergy is the same and presents the same.", "YTA. mind your own business, what does it matter if he wants to eat gluten-free and why? be an adult.", "YTA.

Not celiac but when I accidentally eat it hours later i have the worst migraine and joint pain. will it happen right away- no. Will I get the massive stomach issues and pain about 5-8 hour -you better believe it. And then I'm sick for a couple of days. Don't tamper with anyone's food. Even if you don't think the allergy they have is legitimate. (in my family my mother and I have this no one else). YTA", "Yo this is hilarious, it\u2019s like some drake n Josh shit", "\"Hahah! He didn't die instantly, therefore I'm vindicated and have proven my sibling is a lying liar and humiliated him in front of his family and friends! Hooray for me!\" - OP, I guess", "So many people seem to think this and I find it so confusing. They assume bad = instant poison or something. \n\nSome food allergies don\u2019t do anything visual, the person just gets sick or unwell as it digests. Unless they complain you may never know they had a reaction.", "If he has a negative coeliac blood screen and endoscopic biopsies show no sign, we could be clear he doesn\u2019t have it. However, I don\u2019t know whether this has been done.", "So witnessing the brother drink gluten with no adverse effect isn\u2019t evidence enough he is lying?", "Yeah, if you want to call him out on his lie in front of family, you point out the things he has chosen to consume that you know have gluten in them and tell him to explain that. Your tampering with his food just makes you an AH even if he doesn't even have the slightest hint of any gluten sensitivity.", "He went through many tests and the gluten allergy is self diagnosed. In his blood tests there was no proof he has an allergy. Everyone just played along.", "I wouldn't trust someone who did something like that. What other theories will they want to test?", "Well, coeliac disease isn't that deadly, so no harm done in the end", "Yup I don\u2019t have the link at the moment; but there was that grandmother who killed her granddaughter because she was trying to prove to her daughter that she wasn\u2019t allergic to coconut oil some years back.", "I wanted opinions so I will def not fight back here. I\u2019ll take it but to explain, I felt like he did it for attention. Almost like no one could grieve but him. Me and my cousins needed our family too and all eyes were on him. I just want to clarify. I do know on some level it was mean but I know he was lying", "It just hurt. We could have all done the same but he made something up to get everyone\u2019s attention", "Even if he's not wrong, tampering with food is always unacceptable. I have a friend who claims to be allergic to a certain spice but i've watched him eat foods with that spice over and over. I'll even say \"hey that contains the spice, don't eat it\" and he'll eat it!  If i use that spice in my cooking i'll warn him and he eats it! I have never used it without warning him to \"prove\" he's lying.", "And this damage may not have immediate symptoms.   So may still have actually caused harm.  Also tests for celiac are if it's a positive test then you have it.  A negative test does not rule out celiac, it just means at the time the blood/tissue being tested did not show signs of this autoimmune disease.", "Answer is yes, he has stopped my parents from eating gluten in front of him. They changed everything for him.", "Well said.", "It doesn't matter if it was fake or not. It also isn't any indication that he doesn't have a gluten intolerance bc he didn't have a reaction the same day. \n\nYou do not fuck with peoples food. Ever.", "Still TA. Don't fuck with people's food without their knowledge and consent. This is pretty basic stuff. It doesn't matter how hurt you felt or how many hours you spent justifying your behavior in your own head.", "Ever see a lactose intolerant person eat ice cream? He can have a gluten sensitivity and still choose to drink beer if he wants. Does it make him an idiot? Probably. Does it make you TA? Definitely. I\u2019m celiac and have no real external symptoms. I also tested negative on my blood work and needed the biopsy to verify. I could drink beer and wouldn\u2019t really look sick but I\u2019m screwing with my small intestine and will eventually become anemic. If someone fucked with my food because they thought I was faking I would be livid.", "You do not fuck with peoples food and it is NOWHERE NEAR CHEATING! OP was not affected! She could have ignored it and minded her own business and nothing would have changed. This is not at all like a cheating partner.", "But he wasn't doing anyone harm by changing his diet? Do you seriously think people who change their diet interrupt other people?", "So stop acting like it?\n\n\nHe is intolerant to gluten - common phrasing he's ALLERGIC to it....\n\n\nPeople eat/touch stuff there are allergic to allllllll the time get off your high horse!", "Yeah ... I'm not gonna comment on the possible gluten allergy because I am no medical professional and it isn't my place, but as someone with a slight lactose intolerance ... Well. \n\nWould I die if someone switched my vegetal milk with normal milk ? Nah. I wouldn't even be sick, actually, I'd have a slight tummy ache and pass lots of stinky gases.\n\nBut I'd consider it fucking rude and wouldn't trust them with my drinks again. People know their food sensitivity, and can choose what they want to eat or not, one just needs to respect that.", "I think OP is claiming he never bothered to get tested , he self diagnosed. I agree with him his brother is full of shit, but food tampering is never acceptable.", "These things do not diagnose or disprove gluten sensitivity. There is no medically backed way of testing for this. The tests you mentioned are for Celiac. Most people self-diagnose because they feel better off gluten.", "But he doesn't claim to have an autoimmune disorder such as coeliacs disease, he is claiming to have a wheat gluten allergy? The test for that is a blood panel to measure for IgE antibodies in the blood.", "I worked with a woman who had coeliac. She was diagnosed in her late 20s, purely by accident. She wanted to donate blood and her haemoglobin was low. A lot of tests later, yup she's coeliac. Never showed ANY symptoms.\n\nIf OPs brother hadn't fully cut out gluten, then his body might not yet be reacting to it as though it was an allergen. Doesn't mean it's not still messing up his insides.\n\nBesides, allergies aren't a straight forward 100 or nothing case. My cousin can eat cooked tomatos but not raw. If you see her eating a pizza it doesn't mean she's not allergic.", "How does she *know* there was no effect? If I\u2019m fed any onion product including onion powder, I can eat in in the moment but then a reaction starts 40 minutes to an hour later and I get at least 24 hours of horrific cramps and diarrhoea. If someone did that to me deliberately I\u2019d consider it assault.", "Blood tests aren't conclusive proof, sorry to tell you. A blood test can *suggest* you may be coeliac, but it doesn't prove you do or don't. And there's no blood test for gluten sensitivity, which whilst not an allergy, does cause a LOT of GIT issues", "A gluten intolerance is frequently diagnosed through elimination diets and self-reporting symptom changes, you know that right?", "I get where you are coming from but you can not tamper with food. Roll your eyes, tell him he's faking for attention but don't tamper with anyone's food!", "Assault isn\u2019t murder, so what\u2019s the big deal? \u2026/s", "I would encourage you to lock yourself in the bathroom with someone who has gluten issues after eating gluten and see if you think no harm is done. What a selfish take.", "That reflects poorly on him. I promise you, everyone else knows or suspects his allergy is made up or imagined. \n\nYou made yourself the villain, here.", "Why could no one else grieve?  His having an allergy isn't going to stop others from being sad and grieving.", "So you risked sending your brother to the hospital because you *felt* he did it for attention? \n\nWhere is \u201cno one else can grieve but him\u201d coming from? Because shortly after someone died he started thinking he might have a gluten allergy? Huh? You\u2019re the one obsessed with attention.", "[deleted]", "Who cares?? A lot of people, especially Americans don't eat gluten and have seen significant improvement in their health. Doesn't mean they're allergic. Why should he eat something that makes him feel bad? \n\nYou're 24 years old. You all need to grow up", "Who cares if he did it for attention. thats his business", "How does him having an allergy block anyone else from grieving?", "Are you seriously 24 years old?", "You could have ignored it.", "They have made choices as  grown adults to alter their diet. Nobody seems to be bothered by this but you.", "The whole story where you intentionally poisoned your brother out of jealousy that he was getting \u201ctoo much attention\u201d includes your whole family sitting around eating bread\u2026It\u2019s clearly not some banned item.", "Also, there are a lot of gluten reduced beers now that are treated to remove gluten. Not all of them have very clear labeling.", "Conpletely agree. I have a friend with a gluten intolerance (not allergy) and while he won't eat things like bread, he'll make an exception for beer because, to him, the later discomfort is better than giving up beer \ud83e\udd23 I also know a lactose intolerant person who will eat pizza and ice-cream - again, the pain and discomfort is worth it to them to continue enjoying their favourite foods.", "OP explained how Kyle's lie negatively affected the family while they were trying to grieve. Even apart from that, people lying about food allergies is a serious problem. Not as bad as cheating, sure, but not a non-issue that everyone should just ignore. \n\nI'm sure that's exactly what Kyle told himself as he wasted the time of medical professionals and added another worry to his struggling family - 'I'm not hurting anyone, it's no big deal.' Not true.", "But a sensitivity isn\u2019t an allergy, and that\u2019s where people who will be hospitalised if exposed to gluten or eg exposed to peanut get frustrated as \u2018allergy\u2019 has been misused so much as a term that the general public don\u2019t understand that people literally die within minutes with some allergies. I agree people with gluten sensitivity feel better off gluten, same as I avoid eating and drinking certain things because I have severe dysphagia, but that\u2019s not an allergy either. Allergy is a very precise term.", "Good point, my assumption was that he was claiming to have coeliac as they often describe themselves as allergic to gluten. But equally he should have a specific IgE to that.", "Thank you for a great response!", "> cooked tomatos but not raw.\n\nThat's because the cooking denatures the protein she's allergic to. Basically cooking removes the allergen. This is nothing like that.", "Thank you. My info and understanding on allergies has been enhanced.", "I'm not defending anyone, just stating that it isn't lethal. Though absolutely terrible", "Well to be fair, his \u201cgluten allergy\u201d only extended to foot, and nothing else. It\u2019s actually pretty disrespectful to put all that attention on yourself when you don\u2019t even require all of that", "I def raised this with my parents. Side note too I live with Kyle and have seen him drink beer and use gluten cosmetics such as lip balm with gluten like ingredients.", "Exactly this. OP\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t require a medical reason not to eat gluten. People make choices about their diets all the time for all sorts of reasons. It doesn\u2019t take much to respect someone else\u2019s choices. Wtf would OP have done if he caused a medical reaction? Say oops sorry? This whole thing is ridiculous and only proves OP is not trustworthy.", "It happened right after grandma died. It terrified my parents too. All eyes were on my brother. So it went from of family grieving to \u201coh no Kyle! He is sick! We have to rush to him!\u201d Sort of thing. Me and my cousins took a step back and did say it was weird timing. Very odd. Like he wanted all eyes on him. That is why my cousins also laughed when they saw. Because they always had the feeling he was faking", "That\u2019s true. And some like Corona say they\u2019re under 20ppm and are safe for gluten sensitive people.", "There's actually no such thing as a gluten allergy because of what gluten is. You can have a wheat allergy, or barley or rye allergies. But some people refer to their gluten intolerance or  sensitivity as an allergy to help people understand what they mean by not being able to eat it. Sometimes people will take an allergy seriously and not an intolerance. The same thing happens with lactose intolerance, sometimes people will just say dairy allergy.\n\nRegardless, your comment doesn't change my point at all and we're kinda off topic now.", "> Well, coeliac disease isn't that deadly, so no harm done in the end. \n   \nSo this is your statement. The \u201cno harm done in the end\u201d is only true **if** OPs brother is actually faking it. Giving gluten to someone with an allergy or celiac can *100%* cause harm to that person. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s lethal. Assault/battery (by legal definition) are non-lethal so by your statement as written there\u2019s \u201cno harm done in the end\u201d.", "Gluten cosmetics are not a large concern except for very sensitive people. It needs to reach your stomach to have an effect. You are woefully uneducated on gluten-related issues. You could have caused serious damage. If you actually ended up hurting him you could be charged with assault. Did you ever think of that?", "You realize grief/trauma can cause those symptoms too, right? Even if he doesn't have a gluten intolerance, those symptoms were likely very real. While people like to write off things like \"somatic syndrome\" as someone making things up, it's often that the body is reacting to the emotional state in a physical way. Something like going gluten-free can also alleviate the symptoms, as finding a treatment that an individual believes works will decrease the stress/anxiety. His body may have manifested those symptoms in response to grief. Eating gluten-free is not harmful to the person following the diet or those around them, so it's not necessarily a bad way to cope if it helps. Also, he may actually have a gluten intolerance that was triggered by grief increasing the inflammation in his body, so that's when the symptoms popped up.", "And a lot of IPAs are very low gluten just by the nature of how they\u2019re brewed. Honestly it\u2019s becoming more and more common to find beers that aren\u2019t going to be problematic for gluten sensitivities. I know of a brewery that enzyme treats every single beer they brew to be gluten reduced.", "There's also a very steep learning curve for those who are celiac.  And there's being celiac, being allergic and being sensitive to gluten...all 3 are real conditions and have different rules as far as what you can/cannot eat/drink/use."]}
