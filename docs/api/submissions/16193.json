He was practically a bully when he was alive and when he died, he was not magically this amazing brother. I put on a hard to read face for his funeral and around my parents and did my best to support him but inside there was no loss for me. I don't remember when I stopped loving my brother, but it happened years ago, when I realized how much he truly hated me. It was petty stuff when we were little kids like calling me names and he'd steal food off my plate and stuff. But then it was things like saying I would be better off dead, or he would be left in charge and stop me from eating/drinking what was in the house, even preventing me from getting a glass of water or a snack. My parents always told me I should tell them when he acted that way but as far as I could see, it was just to tell me it would get better and sometimes older siblings can be \"jerks\". He even broke things I loved, including a gaming laptop I saved over a year to buy when I was 13 and to make sure I remembered what he had done, he did it in my room so there would be potentially small traces of it left after cleaning it up.\n\nMy parents never really believed that there was no love between us. They also didn't see that I wasn't sad he was gone. They would tell me over and over how much he loved me and how I would \"grow up without my best friend but it was okay because we would all get through it together\".\n\nSo that's the background. My school was doing a memorial for students last Friday. I skipped it. Since my parents weren't going to be there, and I wasn't grieving or wanting to honor my brother like a saint, I simply left school early that day. Some teachers and the principal noticed and told my parents and they were sobbing when I got home. They told me how much it hurt them that I would skip out on something for my brother and did I not want to remember him fondly. I told them it's hard to remember your bully fondly and it is hard to want to celebrate the life of someone who treated you like shit. They said he was still my brother and I still loved him. I didn't say anything to that. They were so upset and sent me to my room for the rest of that day.\n\nThey told me I was wrong all weekend. I can see they feel differently about me now.

I get that lying doesn't come easy to some and tbh you shouldn't even have to lie to people, but it's the situation you're in. Just try to act like you don't want to think about him because it'll make you sad. This should 1. Get them off your back and make them less likely to bring him up in your presence and 2.

In that situation, his feelings should take precedence. _For once._", "I know this is coming from a place of compassion to the parents, but I don't think you're giving enough weight to OP's experience and the suffering he went through, which it was _their job_ to protect him from. They failed him (and to an extent, his brother) very badly in brushing quite vicious abuse under the carpet. \n\nIt's not that they deserve to be hurt (although OP wanting to lash out would be completely understandable and _entirely_ their own fault), but they don't deserve to be shielded from the consequences of their failure to act. And it's DEFINITELY not OP's job to downplay his pain to ease theirs. \n\nOP, you're right not to allow yourself to be gaslighted. No-one except you suffered your brother's cruelty, and NO-ONE gets to tell you how you should react to it, or when you should be over it (there's no 'should' here at all). Absolutely bloody not.", "I can see the teachers being concerned he didn't show up.", "I don't think OP, as a child and still dependent on their parents, can do anything but make their own life harder by holding the parents to account, or trying to get them to accept the brother was abusive. \n\nLife is unfair. OP needs to get through their childhood and become independent before tackling that issue with them.\nAnd it wasn't the parents who asked if they were the Assholes.", "Thing is, there have been issues in this family since long before the older brother died. The parents were complicit in the abuse OP experienced. They preferred to be willfully blind to the fact that there was a problem rather than try and solve it. That's toxic behavior on their part. Now the brother is literally dead and they're *still* pressuring OP to pretend his relationship with his brother was all normal and fine, because they can't accept that something twisted and wrong was going on in their household. They want this to be a kinder story than it is and it's leading them to cause untold harm to OP. And I hate to say it, but there's a tendency to put dead loved ones on a pedestal and refuse to acknowledge their wrongs. If OP's parents were already ignoring the brother's faults *before* the death, they are not going to accept any kind of revelation on this topic afterwards, when there's no hope of reconciliation, no way to find answers, and nothing but his memory to cling to. \"Sullying\" that memory would be too painful. It's not healthy or fair, but it is what it is. OP's only realistic hope is to get out of this situation, and preferably out of this town, which seems to love his AH brother more than him.", "<<*jumping on the \"just leave\" train is a bit much*\\>>\n\nI had to stop short of this too.  \n\nOther than this issue(and was it just because of deathiversary that it came up?) we don't know how they are as parents of ONE child(we know they were neglectful when there was two).\n\nFor all we know, on a current day to day basis, they may take good care of him provide him with his needs, indicate they'll pay for his higher education, give him a car.\n\nHonestly, if OP can stand strong in knowing he has every right to his feelings, his experience, his truth, and they don't spend every day bringing up the brother, He may be fine finishing off his High school and higher education with them funding/providing for him.  \n\nHe just needs to make sure he has options.  That if their behavior deteriorates,  or is worse than this post outlines, then he needs to be able to hit the road \"safely\".", "I\u2019m not sure when this sub suddenly jumped on this \u201ctherapy isn\u2019t worth trying\u201d train but here we are lol. No idea why everyone is downvoting you for saying to try a family counselor.", "NTA. I get where you're coming from. I list a sibling who was also a hateful human. People would extend condolences. I just looked at them. Really didn't know what to say. Their death meant nothing.", "NTA\n\nAlso how rude for the teachers and principles to report you back to your parents. Maybe you were grieving so hard you couldn't stand to be there, they don't know. They have no right to judge you and report you like that. \n\nYour parents were and are clearly blind to the way your brother treated you. I'm sorry for the rough childhood you had growing up.", "NTA. Just because your parents refused to accept reality for practically your whole life doesn't mean that you should be forced to pretend to mourn someone.", "You are not a fond memory dispensing object, you are a *person*.  \n\n\nNow, *your parents* probably are having all the hard feelings at his death -- losing a child is one of the worst experiences a person can have --  and it's probably also painful to them that you didn't have the close sibling relationship they would have wanted. But that's not *your* problem. That's just an explanation for why they may be putting this pressure on you. It's not really about you. \n\nIf you want to (completely optional), you can tell your parents that you're \"having trouble processing your brother's death\" or something and that you think you would benefit from therapy. Then, once you get to therapy (a therapist is required to keep what you say in confidence, as long as you're not a threat to yourself or others) you can use the chance to talk about whatever you want: your frustrations about having been bullied, the weirdness of being  expected to sing the praises of your dead asshole brother, your relationship with your parents, your life goals, whatever. Your parents may have an easier time dealing with your lack of visible mourning if they think that there's some psychological block going on. \"I have complicated feelings\" can go over better than \"I have no love for him\".\n\n(And you might find you *do* have complicated feelings, or are kinda mourning the nice brother he could have been, but if you don't? You own your emotional reality. You can choose to be blunt or be circumspect about it, but either way it's *yours* and you are not obligated to try to cultivate feelings you do not actually have.)", "NTA. I have siblings who bullied me and are horrendous. Thank goodness I\u2019m an adult I don\u2019t have to deal with them. To be honest when they die I wouldn\u2019t care less. Probably won\u2019t be going to their funeral either. I love traveling so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do instead going to the funeral. Sometimes the enemies can be within your own family.", "It was badly done all around imo. \n\nThe school could have checked in with OP personally, but if it was during regular school hours, I find it understandable they follow truancy procedures. \n\nIn secondary school, I had at least one or two teachers I could have told I wouldn't be comfortable participating. No guarantee the school would have let it go, but at least they would have known, right? \nPerhaps that's also something OP could have done?", "College is coming soon. It will get you away and often offers therapy. You\u2019ll soon be around people who didn\u2019t know your brother. Until then hang on. You can also write in a journal to get your feelings out but I would recommend burning whatever you write.", "I do agree, but in the end, the brother's dead, whatt he did is in the past, the parents made tons of mistake to not see it but what's done is done.\n\nIf OP wants to hold a grugde and the parents I won't judge it's pretty understandable because they definitely have their part of responsability in all of this, but in the end their intentions didn't appear to be malicious.\n\nIt was manky an advice that if OP wants to stay in good terms with the parents he shouldn't insult his brother too much in front of them because it will only create tensions.\n\nI also agree with you that if OP is mad and hurt them by insulting his brother it is the consequences of their actions that led to all of this but I don't think it's necessary to do so since all of this is over. I support 100% the no show at the ceremony cause fuck that.", "Be strong, OP. When you get married and have a son the pressure to name him after the brother will be intense. Time and distance are your 2 best friends.", "Actual therapist & considered the best child psychiatrist in the southeast United States", "That\u2019s alarming", "NTA, \n\nHowever...I'll probably get flamed for this from the 'speak your truth people' \n\n.....but this is one of those incidents where it might be better to lie. You know your parents are grieving, and loved your brother, and even if he was hateful towards you and you feel nothing a 'we had a difficult relationship, I loved him, but I prefer to grieve in my own way' might have made your parents feel better than 'I don't want to celebrate his life.' Because even if he was hateful and awful to you, parents love their children unconditionally.", "Dude I\u2019m late to your post, but I totally get it and totally NTA. Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to miss the dead. Not all of them were always nice to us. The trick is to find a middle ground between lionizing people who didn\u2019t deserve it, and disparaging the dead. You shouldn\u2019t have to do the first one, but it\u2019s wise not to do the latter. Peace to you.", "No, but it could be a symptom of not coping well with his death. The teachers probably contacted his parents to check in, not admonish him for not participating.", "YTA. You'll regret being a jerk to your parents about their dead son one day.", "Get some therapy AH", "No one can tell you how to grieve.", "Sent to room at 17 years old??", "NTA.  I love that you are honest.  If you want people not to judge you, just say that it\u2019s \u201cjust too hard\u201d for you to attend a memorial and \u201cbrings all the grief to the surface\u201d so it\u2019s better if you just not attend.    \n\nIt\u2019s ok not to be sad.", "Oh OP I am so sorry, you were abused and now they are trying to force you to grieve your abuser. You sound very strong and smart so hopefully you can work this out. Your parents need to get a grip and stop making you feel bad.", "This also happened to me when I was 17. Therapy stopped being effective after that ,and I was never able to trust her again.\n\nDefinitely not right, but it definitely happens."]}
