He was practically a bully when he was alive and when he died, he was not magically this amazing brother. I put on a hard to read face for his funeral and around my parents and did my best to support him but inside there was no loss for me. I don't remember when I stopped loving my brother, but it happened years ago, when I realized how much he truly hated me. It was petty stuff when we were little kids like calling me names and he'd steal food off my plate and stuff. But then it was things like saying I would be better off dead, or he would be left in charge and stop me from eating/drinking what was in the house, even preventing me from getting a glass of water or a snack. My parents always told me I should tell them when he acted that way but as far as I could see, it was just to tell me it would get better and sometimes older siblings can be \"jerks\". He even broke things I loved, including a gaming laptop I saved over a year to buy when I was 13 and to make sure I remembered what he had done, he did it in my room so there would be potentially small traces of it left after cleaning it up.\n\nMy parents never really believed that there was no love between us. They also didn't see that I wasn't sad he was gone. They would tell me over and over how much he loved me and how I would \"grow up without my best friend but it was okay because we would all get through it together\".\n\nSo that's the background. My school was doing a memorial for students last Friday. I skipped it. Since my parents weren't going to be there, and I wasn't grieving or wanting to honor my brother like a saint, I simply left school early that day. Some teachers and the principal noticed and told my parents and they were sobbing when I got home. They told me how much it hurt them that I would skip out on something for my brother and did I not want to remember him fondly. I told them it's hard to remember your bully fondly and it is hard to want to celebrate the life of someone who treated you like shit. They said he was still my brother and I still loved him. I didn't say anything to that. They were so upset and sent me to my room for the rest of that day.\n\nThey told me I was wrong all weekend. I can see they feel differently about me now.

I get that lying doesn't come easy to some and tbh you shouldn't even have to lie to people, but it's the situation you're in. Just try to act like you don't want to think about him because it'll make you sad. This should 1. Get them off your back and make them less likely to bring him up in your presence and 2.

Personally funerals and memorials don't help me process grief, they are just a social burden placed upon me while I greive.", " I doubt they really know how bad it actually was for you.", "Honestly there are also plenty of reasons someone who was grieving would want to skip a memorial like that. Your parents want you to perform a grief that's acceptable to them, but the emotions that hit after someone dies are rarely palatable to people like that.", "[removed]", "Since you know everyone would have been staring at you. I love both my sisters but if they had died and then held a school memorial two years later, I could totally see not going. They should not have even informed your parents.", "NTA - Your parents are still grieving and probably will for the rest of their lives to some extent. They might also be grieving for the lack of opportunity for you and your sibling to have a better a relationship. He died your bully. There is no way to fix that.", "What?", "Therapy only works if you can accept that you might be in the wrong, the parents are doing no such thing. The best thing OP can do for himself is get his papers in order, get a job and start saving so he can get out of that house as soon as possible. Because there was clearly a golden child and a scapegoat and even though golden one is two years dead, scapegoat is never going to get out of that role in that family. Leaving is the only option if he wants to heal.", "I can see the teachers being concerned he didn't show up. Not knowing the issues OP has, they could have taken it as a suicide risk.", "Exactly, thank you. This is why I never agreed to family therapy. My mom never would have listened. My sister definitely wouldn't have listened. It would've just ended in my home life being way worse.", "Therapy can help you get to accepting that you might be in the wrong. \n\nIt's not a solution in itself, it's the process that you go through in order to reach a goal.\n\nThey need better communication and his parents need to stop minimizing how OP feels and what he went through. That's not a one-session thing. That's a multi month, or year thing, depending on how it goes.\n\nBut, jumping on the \"just leave\" train is a bit much. Yeah, there's issues, but just up and leaving may not be the best idea.", "OP is a minor and too many therapists have a policy of telling a patient's parents about what they say if the patient is a minor.", "I could totally see not going. They should not have even informed your parents. The school should have consulted you beforehand, had a counselor talk to you, and realized how hard that could be on ANY student.", "And \u201cthe best they\u2019re going to get\u201d is the same as \u201cmagical advice\u201d according to you? If no, why did you quote the \u201cmagical advice\u201d part?", " \nI think my brothers agree because no one talks about him.", "I went to a lot of therapy as a kid. And I am old. That doesn't happen. \"Do child therapists tell your parents?  \nThe law allows the minor the corresponding right of confidentiality and the right to authorize disclosure of treatment information.

You have a right to feel the way you do.", "Did I state otherwise?", "NAH. We don\u2019t decide how we feel that\u2019s not how emotions work. When asked how you\u2019re feeling about the situation by them I\u2019d suggest presenting a straight face and simply asking them how they\u2019d like you to feel. If they\u2019re confused by that simply state that you\u2019d rather give them the answer they\u2019d like to avoid any hurt feelings. That should send a message.", "OP my brother died when I was in high school too. No one gets to tell you how to grieve. It will change over time. My family was upset with me for the way I expressed my grief too. For the first several years I was relieved. He was very sick and in pain and his care sucked up all the space in everyone\u2019s life. He was never going to get better so I was so relieved it was over for him and for us. Later it was different. It\u2019s been 22 years now and it changes all the time. This is normal and looks different for everyone, don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise. \n\nThe idea that your school tried to make a spectacle of you as a memorial to him is bananas. There is no reason you should be expected to annually go in front of your entire school and display any emotion for their benefit. I\u2019m sorry your parents aren\u2019t seeing that.

That doesn't make any sense. You're 17, so you're in 11th or 12th grade. He was older than you, so most of the kids didn't even know him. Plus, it's just inappropriate. Do they hold memorials for the anniversaries of student deaths all throughout the year?", "NTA\n\nSometimes it's hard for parents to see the truth of what their children really are. That is no fault of yours.", "NTA. Even if you were the closest two siblings could be, you don't have to go to his memorial. If your parents want the fiction of you being super close, they should accept that people grieve differently and a public memorial is SUPER not it for some. I think you're handling this very maturely keeping your feelings to yourself and letting your parents grieve", "NTA. Yall need Family therapy immediately.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry for your loss - the loss of your \u201cfamily\u201d\u2026 your personal reputation \u2026 what you currently believe is the love from your parents \u2026\n\nMaybe now you can breathe and the truth of your life can come out. \n\nGod bless you. Good luck.", "Nta. But can you get a therapist to talk about this? This must be so hard for you.\n\nIt's hard for your parents to. They love you both. Maybe you can say you grief in your own way. You don't want to do that at school? You don't talk bad about him then", "Wow.   Your school is trying to dictate your grieving for your own brother, the same as your parents are.  Firstly you need to file whatever complaint you can against the school for trying to force your grieving into the public eye.  Do they have nothing better to do than throw memorials?  That's something for FAMILY to do.  As for your family that's a harder battle to fight.  Your parents are never going to want to see the truth about this situation, because they're also grieving their other son.  Honestly I'd just leave it.  Find people you can talk to about the truth, or maybe try counseling?  Work on your own feelings, you can't control your parents feelings.

Your perception is your reality.", "NTA, people always make it seem that death negates any bad thing a person did while alive. It doesn\u2019t. He was a bully to you, not a loving brother.

They did no parenting and lost their favourite son and are now upset that not only does OP have no feelings for their favourite, but if anyone finds out why they're going to be shown to be the parental failures that they are.", "agree", "They see the fighting and bullying and even the outright abuse as normal childhood sibling conflict that will go away once the kids are adults.", "NTA Welp, it's obvious who the favorite was. Keep in mind that while he was your bully, he was their kid, so I doubt they will ever take off their rose tinted glasses so I'd try to cool it with the comments.", "Reddit thinks therapy is a magical solution to all problems. The truth is that for therapy to work, everyone has to acknowledge there's a problem, want to solve it together, want to be there, and find exactly the right therapist. If those things don't apply, it can backfire.\n\nAside from the fact that OP is not in a position to decide whether he and his parents should go to therapy, there are some things to remember. There's a colossal power imbalance between a teenager and his two parents who are united in their views. A therapist may give everyone a chance to speak, but they don't say who's right and who's wrong, or what to do. And they can't force people to listen. This could end up with OP dragging his feet to spend an hour each week with a whole lot of lecturing about how great his brother was.\n\nIndividual therapy is one thing. As soon as it involves more than one person, the existing dynamic between those people becomes really important.", "Apart from this, OP, if you need to get your parents of your back tell them something of the sort that yes, maybe in a few years when you forget the crap you will grieve the brother he could have been and the one he might have been once you are older.

I'm not sure if there were more students involved in being remembered, in which case that's horribly tragic, but for them to not ask of OP was okay with a very public display of (what they assumed) grief makes the whole thing seem really performative and poor taste.", "I actually find this story bizarre. Why is a school holding a memorial on the 2nd anniversary of the death of a student? That doesn't make any sense.", "Dodging a memorial service is not a suicidal calling card.", "Yes, it needs effort and buy in.", "NTA I'd show them the comments on this thread. And I hope they clean their act up so that they don't loose the child that they have left.", ">The truth is that for therapy to work, everyone has to acknowledge there's a problem, want to solve it together, want to be there, and find exactly the right therapist.\n\nYes?   \n\n\nI mean, he could just go NC, move out, and have nothing ever to do with them ever again.   \n\n\nThe parents have to figure out there was a problem. Therapy has a much better chance of getting to that point than OP just banging his head against a brick wall.  Therapy may also have a shorter time horizon for that goal.   \n\n\nTherapy works, because it is facilitated communication. Yes, it needs effort and buy in. Just like every other form of communication.", "truth! And you said it perfectly!", "I pretty much assume anything a school would do would be performative, to be honest. But I don't think having a memorial without asking OP is necessarily bad, it's just... if someone close to the situation doesn't want to go to something like that, why would you push it?? Either they're hurting a lot from losing someone they love, or else they're like OP and don't want to have grief for someone who tormented them shoved in their face.", "OP doesn\u2019t say how his brother passed; when a classmate of mine was killed by a drunk driver, the school memorialized him.

That'll protect vulnerable kids from abuse. Just tell them it *shouldn't* have happened, and then everything will be fine."]}
