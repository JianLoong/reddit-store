{"id": 16193, "submission_id": "135eisn", "title": "AITA for skipping a memorial my school held for my brother for his second anniversary?", "selftext": "My (17m) older brother died 2 years ago. I won't beat around the bush, I'm not sad he's dead. He was an asshole to me. He hated my guts as long as I could remember. He was practically a bully when he was alive and when he died, he was not magically this amazing brother. I put on a hard to read face for his funeral and around my parents and did my best to support him but inside there was no loss for me. I don't remember when I stopped loving my brother, but it happened years ago, when I realized how much he truly hated me. It was petty stuff when we were little kids like calling me names and he'd steal food off my plate and stuff. But then it was things like saying I would be better off dead, or he would be left in charge and stop me from eating/drinking what was in the house, even preventing me from getting a glass of water or a snack. My parents always told me I should tell them when he acted that way but as far as I could see, it was just to tell me it would get better and sometimes older siblings can be \"jerks\". He even broke things I loved, including a gaming laptop I saved over a year to buy when I was 13 and to make sure I remembered what he had done, he did it in my room so there would be potentially small traces of it left after cleaning it up.\n\nMy parents never really believed that there was no love between us. They also didn't see that I wasn't sad he was gone. They would tell me over and over how much he loved me and how I would \"grow up without my best friend but it was okay because we would all get through it together\".\n\nSo that's the background. My school was doing a memorial for students last Friday. I skipped it. Since my parents weren't going to be there, and I wasn't grieving or wanting to honor my brother like a saint, I simply left school early that day. Some teachers and the principal noticed and told my parents and they were sobbing when I got home. They told me how much it hurt them that I would skip out on something for my brother and did I not want to remember him fondly. I told them it's hard to remember your bully fondly and it is hard to want to celebrate the life of someone who treated you like shit. They said he was still my brother and I still loved him. I didn't say anything to that. They were so upset and sent me to my room for the rest of that day.\n\nThey told me I was wrong all weekend. I can see they feel differently about me now. They don't like that they are now facing the truth.

And it is completely unreasonable for your parents to punish you for not grieving to their expectations. \n\nYou are allowed to put boundaries up and you shouldn\u2019t have to force yourself to \u201cgrieve\u201d for someone who was by sounds of things an AH towards you. \n\nYour parents seem to be forgetting that he wasn\u2019t a golden child, and in doing that also forgetting their still living child. And I\u2019m sorry, because that sounds really hard. \n\nWish there was some sort of magical advice I could give for this but there\u2019s no easy solution. I suppose the ray of hope I see is that you are 17. In the next few years, you can move away from your parents, go to college if you want to, get a job, get your own place. Carve out your own life where the shadow if your brother is looming over you the whole time. It can get better than this.", "NTA. You're not in the wrong for skipping his memorial. He was TA, and your parents (from what I assume) were oblivious to how he treated you. I hope you're doing better now.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry your parents are punishing you for rightfully having your own feelings about the death of your abusive brother . You simply left quietly, you didn\u2019t cause a scene or do anything wrong. Seems like your parents are clouded by grief and delusion. Sad all around,best of luck to you.", "NTA - please bear in mind that it is very difficult for people so close to a situation to see outside their own experience. \nYour parents may struggle to understand but that doesn't mean that your experiences or feelings are any less valid. Their grief is valid too, and I can understand that after a loss they may \"selectively remember \" what your relationship was like, people tend to gloss over difficulties sometimes. \n\nYou are well within your rights to leave. If you wanted to be very gentle with your parents (and make your life easier) you could just say that these events remembering your brother are difficult for you because your relationship was complicated & you feel unable to attend.", "NTA, your feeling are valid and just because it's family doesn't mean you own him anything.\n\nOn the other hand even if you hated his guts for what he did try to remember that he was still your parents son so they must be devastated at the loss. \nSo I would say that how you feel is perfectly fine but try to not be to hats on your brother because it light Hurst your parents a lot. \nI know they handled the whole situation like shit but it seem more like incompetence than malicious from them.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to have your own grieve process. Yours is about how he treated you, and how you can handle that now that he\u2019s gone. He can never change, he can never apologize, and it\u2019s then a lot harder to forgive. Hopefully you will someday, in some way, as bitterness is not worth carrying with you. \n\nYour parents loved him, and they lost him. Their grief is very real, and they feel probably harshly betrayed by you, even though it\u2019s called for. Have that in mind when you \u00abhate\u00bb them. And yeah, they were AH to you too when he was alive, for not protecting you from him. Maybe they will realize, some day. Obviously not yet.", "NTA: straight up just not?? Like?

You\u2019re not in the wrong here, your school were probably concerned for your welfare (that you were struggling with grief instead of the opposite) & your parents allowed their grief to cloud their reaction to your non-attendance. Even if you missed your brother with every cell in your body, a memorial like that may not actually be helpful for you so your parents have no right to guilt trip you or drag you about not going. I know Reddit loves the therapy trope but a calm, honest & open, therapeutic like chat with your parents about how you have specifically been affected by your brother\u2019s death may be a good shout but they don\u2019t sound ready for that to be honest. I wish I could offer more advice or help but all I can say is NTA & send you some love.", "NTA. I am a firm believer that if you're an asshole in life, then you're an asshole in death. Grieving for someone who abuses you in not normal. Your parents enabled his behavior by not stopping it when you were younger. Seems like there was no consequences for his behavior which is why he continued it. You have a right to feel the way you do.", "NTA. No one can tell you how you should feel about someone, whether they're alive or not.\n\nYour parents are now facing the reality of the situation. I'm sure that's very difficult for them. Unfortunately, actions have consequences. Your parents are now having to face the fact that your brother treated you horribly, and their refusal to parent him ruined any chance of you and him reconciling.", "NTA at that age, if my brother had died, I would have felt exactly the same.  \n\nWith age I can see that coming up with polite excuses (even if they aren't actually true) can make your life easier. Lying may not feel good to you, but sometimes it's kinder to others. Your parents aren't being fair to you but they are still deep in their grief, so please be kind to them.  Say things like you just couldn't bear to go to a memorial rather than his death was a relief to you.\nTry and say things nicely, if you can. Even saying you just can't talk about it and being quiet gives your parents room to accept it.\n\nIt is crap when you have one sibling and they are a complete shit, I know. And your parents failed you and now will always consider him flawless. That's shit. But at least you don't have to put up with him anymore. If he was like my brother that is an immense relief.\n\nThings get better when you are an adult. Hold on.\nBest wishes.", "NTA? no one.. not your parents, your boss, or your god can tell you How you feel. only you know how you feel! \nI'm sorry for your loss, I hope it all gets better", "NTA. Your parents created this enviroment by not being there for you and not putting a stop to the bullying.", "NTA\n\nYour parents need to accept your feelings or they will lose both of their children", "NTA.\n\nWhy would you attend the memorial for someone who treated you like shit? Maybe if your parents were there (to support them), but they weren't.", "NTA Welp, it's obvious who the favorite was. Keep in mind that while he was your bully, he was their kid, so I doubt they will ever take off their rose tinted glasses so I'd try to cool it with the comments. You could easily make up some BS to get them off your back but now it's kinda hard to go back and do a 180. For this instance, when you got home, you could have said \"I didn't feel like crying at school in front of everyone\" or some other BS. I get that lying doesn't come easy to some and tbh you shouldn't even have to lie to people, but it's the situation you're in. Just try to act like you don't want to think about him because it'll make you sad. This should 1. Get them off your back and make them less likely to bring him up in your presence and 2. Should make them feel better about living in their delusion and should help make your next couple of years go smoother due to less animosity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
