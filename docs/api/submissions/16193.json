I won't beat around the bush, I'm not sad he's dead. He was an asshole to me. He hated my guts as long as I could remember. He was practically a bully when he was alive and when he died, he was not magically this amazing brother. I put on a hard to read face for his funeral and around my parents and did my best to support him but inside there was no loss for me. I don't remember when I stopped loving my brother, but it happened years ago, when I realized how much he truly hated me. It was petty stuff when we were little kids like calling me names and he'd steal food off my plate and stuff. But then it was things like saying I would be better off dead, or he would be left in charge and stop me from eating/drinking what was in the house, even preventing me from getting a glass of water or a snack. My parents always told me I should tell them when he acted that way but as far as I could see, it was just to tell me it would get better and sometimes older siblings can be \"jerks\". He even broke things I loved, including a gaming laptop I saved over a year to buy when I was 13 and to make sure I remembered what he had done, he did it in my room so there would be potentially small traces of it left after cleaning it up.\n\nMy parents never really believed that there was no love between us. They also didn't see that I wasn't sad he was gone. They would tell me over and over how much he loved me and how I would \"grow up without my best friend but it was okay because we would all get through it together\".\n\nSo that's the background. My school was doing a memorial for students last Friday. I skipped it. Since my parents weren't going to be there, and I wasn't grieving or wanting to honor my brother like a saint, I simply left school early that day. Some teachers and the principal noticed and told my parents and they were sobbing when I got home. They told me how much it hurt them that I would skip out on something for my brother and did I not want to remember him fondly. I told them it's hard to remember your bully fondly and it is hard to want to celebrate the life of someone who treated you like shit. They said he was still my brother and I still loved him. I didn't say anything to that. They were so upset and sent me to my room for the rest of that day.\n\nThey told me I was wrong all weekend. I can see they feel differently about me now. They don't like that they are now facing the truth.

Sad all around,best of luck to you.", "NTA - please bear in mind that it is very difficult for people so close to a situation to see outside their own experience. \nYour parents may struggle to understand but that doesn't mean that your experiences or feelings are any less valid. Their grief is valid too, and I can understand that after a loss they may \"selectively remember \" what your relationship was like, people tend to gloss over difficulties sometimes. \n\nYou are well within your rights to leave.

Even if you missed your brother with every cell in your body, a memorial like that may not actually be helpful for you so your parents have no right to guilt trip you or drag you about not going.

Lying may not feel good to you, but sometimes it's kinder to others. Your parents aren't being fair to you but they are still deep in their grief, so please be kind to them.  Say things like you just couldn't bear to go to a memorial rather than his death was a relief to you.\nTry and say things nicely, if you can. Even saying you just can't talk about it and being quiet gives your parents room to accept it.\n\nIt is crap when you have one sibling and they are a complete shit, I know.

Keep in mind that while he was your bully, he was their kid, so I doubt they will ever take off their rose tinted glasses so I'd try to cool it with the comments. You could easily make up some BS to get them off your back but now it's kinda hard to go back and do a 180. For this instance, when you got home, you could have said \"I didn't feel like crying at school in front of everyone\" or some other BS. I get that lying doesn't come easy to some and tbh you shouldn't even have to lie to people, but it's the situation you're in. Just try to act like you don't want to think about him because it'll make you sad. This should 1. Get them off your back and make them less likely to bring him up in your presence and 2. Should make them feel better about living in their delusion and should help make your next couple of years go smoother due to less animosity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
