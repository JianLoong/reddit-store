She may have been dealing workwise with a schedule that encourages grabbing food on the go rather than shopping and carefully cooking.\n\nMental health, as well as physical health (e.g. taking steroids) can cause weight problems but the prevalence of not merely fat but obese people is suggestive that we can't assume there is something mentally wrong with somebody fat. Unless you're talking 30-40 pounds in a couple of months, it is horribly easy for some people to gain weight. But if OP's wife said something, and her daughter's weight gain is partly from stress, all those attempts by her mother to then control her is likely to *increase* her weight problem not reduce it. When's she's psychologically ready she'll lose weight - and not before. Some people who have had bariatric surgery have liquidised sweet foods and ruined their surgery - you cannot make someone lose weight before they're really ready. \n\nI am old enough to have a father born to a mother born in the 19th century (be the youngest of youngest and you get a serious generation gap). Their family had no access to fast foods or mounds of carbohydrates. Those early photos still show two body types in the family - a lean, wiry body type (which half the family had) and solidly built men (who then all got fat in later years). Some people put on weight very easily - we're just unfortunate and unfortunately need to work twice as hard as some people to stay slim (which I'm not currently doing.....).", "FAKE.  \n\nOP had another thread where he says he\u2019s a single dad and his daughter is 13.", "NTA tell her to stop being fatphobic and gross.

I'd check on your daughters mental health and see if she's taking time to heal from the stressful job, and maybe need therapy or something. But no, her having more weight is not a problem and something a parent needs to push themselves into. Im 500000% sure the daughter knows she's gained weight.
