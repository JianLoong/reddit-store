Your wife is not only controlling, she's judgmental, shallow, unsupportive and mean. Your daughter is an adult and she's beautiful no matter what she weighs, no matter what she wears, no matter how she looks. She's your daughter and your wife should be proud of all that she's accomplished and stop looking at the scale to define her.", "NTA. Your daughter is way too old to be having her parents make unwanted comments about her appearance and weight. I'm certain she is well aware of her weight gain, and anything your wife might say would be really hurtful, and likely not well received. She's an adult. Her weight is 100% her business.", "NTA. \n\nThere is simply nothing you or your wife can do to make this situation better--however, there is a whole lot you can do to make it worse. In other words, you can't force your adult daughter to lose weight, but you can cause her to put on more, ruin her self esteem (which has probably already taken a hit if this has happened over the course of a year), or cause her to go low/no contact with you.  As a fatty myself, I suspect she may have delayed coming home because she dreaded this very meeting and some sort of confrontation over her weight.\n\nYou're handling it just right, OP,  both in terms of your approach to your daughter and your attempts to prevent your wife from taking her own approach. Good luck!", "NTA. Your wife needs to chill.", "NTA.  You\u2019re wife needs to back down", "NTA, you're right. If your daughter wants help or to share about her weight gain she'll ask.", "NTA Your wife is controlling and judgmental. If she is actually concerned, she would figure out ways to help her manage her work stress (which is most likely what is contributing to her weight gain), not shaming her for her appearance. Your daughter needs support, not cruelty.", "If parents could say things to control weight related problems in their children, I would have begged my mother to chastise ME _long ago._ That would be the easiest weight loss plan, _ever._\n\nExcept it doesn't work like that. \n\nNTA, and if your wife says something, she is.", "NTA, what's she going to do, send a whole adult woman to fat camp?", "NTA. Good for you dad. You are correct, she's 25 and can do what she wants.", "NTA. You are a kind and loving dad. Keep being happy to see your daughter and trying to prevent your wife from being mean to her.", "NTA. You are a wonderful dad. I would warn your daughter that her mother is going to say some mean stuff to her about her appearance. \n\nYour wife on the other hand is an AH. If she says anything to your daughter, I can pretty much see your daughter never coming to see y\u2019all again. She may want to see you and not your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
