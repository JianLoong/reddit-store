We pretty much always feel comfortable talking to each other, even in a blunt way. I'm always real with her, and vice versa.\n\nNow, Fiona been with a guy, \"Jack\" (19M), for a while, and they see each other once every couple weeks. We live pretty close to him, and both of them have cars, so they could see each other a lot more often, they just choose not to.\n\nWhen they are together, they don't seem to talk or interact much, they just cuddle and scroll on their phones or something. Fiona doesn't mind this at all-- since it started in high school, she doesn't view their relationship as a big deal, and has said that she doesn't think it'll be a permanent thing. Jack, on the other hand, is very affectionate with her, and the few times I've talked to him one-on-one, he seems to take their relationship pretty seriously, and wants things to keep going for a long time. To me, at least, it's pretty clear that they want different things, and that Jack likes her much more than she likes him.\n\nWorsening matters is the fact that Fiona has a guy best friend, \"Liam\" (21M), who she spends way more time with. Even though I know there isn't anything going on between them-- both of them are very honest, loyal people, neither of them would ever cheat-- I don't think Fiona is aware of how it comes off.\n\nJack is too polite to say anything about it, but when all three of them are in the same room, it's very uncomfortable. She and Liam share way more interests, so he usually takes up the bulk of her attention, even when Jack is right next to her. And, again, while there isn't any cheating going on, Liam DOES have feelings for her (Fiona doesn't know this, I heard from a shared friend), and that makes things a lot harder for both him and Jack.\n\nRecently, Fiona came to me, and said that Jack had broken down and said that it felt like she didn't care about him. She seemed genuinely upset, and kind of bewildered, when I said that yeah, that's kind of how it seems from the outside.\n\nNow, here's where I might be TA: I said she should dump him, since she's hurting Jack, and they don't seem to have a future together. She told me I was reading too much into the situation, and that the Liam thing was a non-issue. I said it was still cruel for her to stay with Jack when he wants something long-term, and she doesn't, but she said she does \"like\" Jack, she just doesn't think relationships should be serious at our age.\n\nWe got in a pretty big argument, and she's been cold-shouldering me for a couple days. I feel bad that I've made her upset, but also, I don't think her relationship is good for anyone involved.Should I have just kept my mouth shut, and not weighed in?

Stringing along a boyfriend who wants a future with you when you clearly don\u2019t feel the same is one of those situations. It may not be what she wanted to hear, but I think it still needed to be said. As long as you didn\u2019t go out of your way to say it harshly, and just presented her with the information like you did here, I think you were within NTA territory to me\n\nEdit: I will say that to me, the Liam piece of this is irrelevant. The bigger problem is leading on someone who has real feelings for her, she can be friends with whoever she wants", "NTA! I think you are just being straight up with your sister. Stringing someone along is fucked up and should be called out. I think the Liam situation is unfortunate byproduct of an already established problem between them. Your sister needs to have a serious conversation with her boyfriend. I think because your sister is young, might not be aware of her actions but she should learn. Even if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out in the end, she\u2019ll be more aware of others feelings in the next", " NTA she asked your opinion and you gave it.

I don't think you are the asshole for saying it, since I agree from what you said, but you may be the AH if you kept at it until she got mad.", "NTA. Introduce Jack to other girl. Better than your sister. Hope you can stay friend with Jack", "I'm gonna go with NAH. Your sister didn't seem fully aware of the differences between how she and Jack feel until he told her, and was probably blindsided by you saying her relationship should end so bluntly-- there was probably a reason she seemed happy. I don't think she's an asshole for anything she's done here. \n\nI will say, you probably could have phrased things better, but, I don't think you giving your opinion was bad. You said you guys are always \"real with each other\", so I don't think you spoke out of place. \n\nMaybe don't get involved further, though, since this sounds like it could get messy.", "YTA\n\nYou might be reading too much manosphere BS and projecting your own stuff into this. I'm picking up vibes by how you seem so concerned that she has a male friend she hangs out with. Oh the horror of her hanging out with other men. Oh the inhumanity that Jack doesn't get all/most of her attention every single second he bestows his grand presence upon her. Like she actually talks to her friend a lot on a shared interest they have clearly she's not prioritizing poor \nJack. You know the same Jack that is supposedly so into her yet can't muster up conversation on topics that she's really interested in.\ud83e\udd28\n\n>Jack, on the other hand, is very affectionate with her, and the few times I've talked to him one-on-one, he seems to take their relationship pretty seriously, and wants things to keep going for a long time\n\nA dude being 'affectionate' aka handy doesn't mean commitment. As for him thinking it's pretty serious does that mean he's introduced her to his family, she's integrated into his friend group, they have college/work plans together, and he's planning on proposing soon? You don't detail what you think is serious and honestly many dudes are fine staying in relationships for years upon years just for the steady sex supply. \ud83e\udee4 And it's very funny how this dude is supposedly so much more serious about this relationship yet he consistently is drawing a blank on having shared interest in conversation with her. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nYour step sister came concern that her boyfriend didn't feel cared for. The reasonable advice would be to suggest ways on how she can improve. Such as hang out with Jack more, have designated date nights once a week, or talk to Jack about his interests more since clearly Jack isn't going to be mustering up any conversation about her interests.\n\nWhat you did is akin to a friend asking for Japanese restaurant suggestions and me going on how they need to eat low carb and such and such to lose the 50lbs that annoys me everytime I look at them.", "YTA, stay out of it. If you want to be a friend to Jack, do that separately from this relationship business.", "YTA", "YTA. It's not appropriate to tell other people whom they should be involved with. Stay out of it.", "YTA\n\nIf Liam was a girl, who happened to share a lot more interests with Fiona than her boyfriend does, would you see that as a problem and tell her to dump Jack? No? So why is it different for her male friend?\n\nYou are unnecessarily sexualising Fiona's relationship with Liam, when she told you she doesn't see him that way.

You and your sister are both young and still figuring out how to navigate life, relationships, etc. And those things are HARD to figure out. \n\nUnfortunately in my experience the only way to REALLY learn the most important lessons is\u2026the hard way. I have younger siblings and occasionally they make choices that I (through my own similar experiences) strongly suspect will turn out badly. But generally I refrain from saying anything, because a) like me, they\u2019re going to have to learn things the hard way, too and b) when things go south, I want them to still feel like they can reach out to me without fear of judgment, and c) as younger siblings, they will ignore my advice anyway (lol).\n\nThat being said - every sibling dynamic is different, and what works in my case might not work in yours. So maybe you did the right thing here - maybe you didn\u2019t. Either way, you and your sister will both learn from this experience. And one of the things YOU might learn is how best to support your sister when she finds herself in a tough and confusing place.", "NTA", "That's fair, the reason I included the Liam thing (there wasn't enough space to say this part) is the fact that she hangs out with him multiple times a week, when both of them have to go much further out of the way to do so-- he lives a lot further than Jack, and has a much busier schedule-- and even though Jack often says he wants to hang out with her more, it consistently doesn't seem to happen. \n\n It was less about him specifically being a problem, and more about the fact that her priorities are clearly on other people, Liam is just the most pronounced example of it.", "Nah, the argument ended pretty fast, it just got kind of loud for a few minutes.

I brought it up because it was more an example of how her priorities are elsewhere, and how it often blows back on Jack. \n\nIf it were completely platonic and Liam were a girl, I'd still have an issue, just because Jack gets left out of conversations completely when he's around.", "Oh, so if he has developed feelings for her, she's *not allowed* to be his friend anymore? Please explain.", "You explained it yourself. She can be his friend if she\u2019s okay with the fact he likes her and will probably make advancements toward her.
