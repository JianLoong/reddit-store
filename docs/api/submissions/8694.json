The apartment is big enough to accommodate someone to stay in the living room, but it still feels cramped sharing a space. Since nyc is such a popular spot, we get requests almost every other week from people to crash at our place. \n\nAt first, we allowed people to stay. It\u2019s fine if close friends and family want to crash of course, but now people we don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll are asking. We recently had not the greatest experience with someone who I used to be friends with not really being gracious for our hospitality and expecting me to show them around the city. I\u2019ve realized hosting isn\u2019t just allowing people to crash, it also means I have to sacrifice my weekend to show people a good time. I am a very busy person and it\u2019s starting to get exhausting and take away from other things I would like to focus on. So we decided to set boundaries on this. \n\nSo last year when we first moved, I met several people on a trip where everyone was offering people to stay at their place from all over the world. I also offered because at the time I did not set that boundary or realize how much is involved. \n\nAnyway, someone already bought their tickets and asked if they could crash at my place and it seemed like she was asking for a week. I honestly don\u2019t know her that well and don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to host people just because the city is expensive. We are not a hotel and we work hard to afford our place. \n\nAnyway, I said at the time of the initial offer, I thought it was something we could accommodate but my partner and I have began to set boundaries on this. And it seems people will keep asking. Many of the other people from the trip are offering their place and meeting up after our initial meet up, which also makes me feel bad. She saw my messages and didn\u2019t respond. I feel guilty about this and feel a pit in my stomach every time I say no. Should I?

That will lead to some frictions, and it might cause you to drift apart from some of your old friends. It happens.\n\nPeople in this sub are *extremely* pro-boundaries, but setting boundaries also creates distance between people, as you're finding out. On the other hand you can't be everyone's tour guide every week, that's ridiculous. It's a balance.\n\nOne thing that I never see talked about here is the idea of 'saving face,' which is actually really important. When people set boundaries in the modern psychotherapy sense, they tend to phrase it as a rejection. 'We just can't take people in anymore,' or try to set a price. I don't know how you said it, but usually making an excuse that both sides know isn't really true is better than outright 'setting a boundary,' as they say.\n\nDon't feel guilty, but accept that there are consequences in terms of how people react to you. But don't worry - moving to NYC tends to involve getting out of sync with your old friends and building up your NYC friends instead, and it's often a transition for the better as people's live change in different ways.", "Hard NTA - your place, not a hotel. NYC is expensive and necessary to work hard there, and your time is valuable.

We're literally a $2 ferry ride from party town, USA.  We would definitely allow certain family and friends stay in our guest room.  But that's it.  It's a standing invite (from us) only situation.  Anyone outside that circle of trust that asks gets an immediate \"no.\"  No explanation, no compromises.  Also, while we'd be happy to go out a time or two with them, we aren't employed at the tourism board.  Explore the city on your own and be mindful of my work from home days.", "NTA. I'm in exactly the same situation as you are. I'll let very close friends crash occasionally (close as in, I've crashed at their place and they don't expect me to play tour guide), but not friends of friends and whatnot. It's a lot of work and time and it's stressful. And no, I don't feel guilty about it.

The fact that you didn\u2019t realize the workload is a bit irrelevant; you actually made the offer and never rescinded it.  The problem is you actually invited them and nothing has materially changed other than your feelings.   No new kid, no family illness, etc.\n\nLiving in a popular tourist area myself, sometimes the requests were to have a place to crash, sometimes they were to visit and catch up, and sometimes they were wanted to do things with me.  \n\nOn their side, buying tickets without a prior conversation is also not good.

You are allowed to change your mind based on what is going on in your life.  What if you had a baby?  what if your parents were ill?  Things change.  you are allowed to say no.

It just doesn\u2019t work out for a longer visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe already have social engagements planned on the weekend, but if you are comfortable showing yourselves around the city, I\u2019ve got a guidebook I could lend you.\u201c\n\nPeople just don\u2019t understand how small New York City apartments can be\u2026.", "NTA. It's not your fault you are getting these requests from people you don't know. NTA at all", "It really is as simple as that.", "This also it's kind of stupid to book a ticket without confirming accomodations. Could be that you are away, someone else is staying there, living situation changed etc...", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel happier doing so, as my heart rate goes up and I feel a pit in my stomach. Wish it was easy to set boundaries and feel physically and mentally happy with the decision, but perhaps it will get better with repetition and time. Ultimately, the alternative is burning myself out for other people.", "Thanks, I\u2019ll keep that quote in mind during our transition.", "Wow thanks for your response. I have definitely seen a lot of rhetoric that \"no\" is a complete sentence. I don't see myself ever getting to that point, but respect everyone's approach. I gave a long explanation that, since we've moved, people have requested to stay our place almost every other week and it's something we've placed boundaries on. I also share a place with my partner, so I also have to respect that it's his space, too. But that I'm happy to look into a guest suite for her and that another girl from the trip wanted to visit so it could be an affordable and fun option for them to coordinate and share a space together. \n\nAnd complete agree, every time I've set boundaries, it has led to losing friends and causing tension. It helps knowing that forecast that I'll be more involved with NYC friends and it seems people here are very good at drawing boundaries. I also noticed that I only want to draw boundaries with people I don't want to waste my time and energy on. This girl is nice, which makes me feel guilty. But I'm not a hotel for every nice person I meet. \n\nThe problem is rooted in the fact that I also try to be nice to everyone I meet and have had people pleaser problems. I don't really enjoy setting boundaries ( (though hope I eventually do), but it's become very necessary with how crazy and busy my life is quickly becoming in the city/being particular with the company I choose to surround myself with.", "Thanks for letting me know. I honestly starting making explanations that perhaps she is flying over here to visit me, but my boyfriend thinks she is 100% just interested in getting free accommodations.", "That makes me feel better. People really are asking every week to every other week. Back in DC, people hardly visited so I enjoyed hosting. I really hate it now unless it's close friends.", "THANK YOU. Exactly. I love that you're setting the \"no explanation, no compromises\" boundary. I'm definitely going to keep that in mind. How do people take it when you say no?", "Thank you, I agree. I try to be hospitable, but trying to not do so to my own detriment and burnout.", "That's fair. I did actually offer to show her around the city and give a list of recommendations of my favorite spots, just that I can't accommodate people at my apartment at the moment. \n\nThat being said, I don't agree I have to have a new kid or family illness to justify this. What changed is that my partner has expressed to me that I can't have people over so often like this and also that the last person that stayed made hosting miserable for the both of us. It has led to me being burned out. When I initially offered, I actually did want to host people. These circumstances have led me to changing my mindset and I believe burnout is a justifiable reason. I don't know this person that well to go out of my way to inform them of this change (we spoke for maybe 30 minutes to an hour max on the trip). That would have been more awkward to me. \n\nI don't expect to be part of the travel group and also don't ask to stay at others' places anymore. Additionally, there were many requests people kept asking me in this group when they learned my occupation and, at this point, I am getting burned out addressing requests for people from a one-time trip. \n\nIn any event, she was very nice in her response, which I really appreciate.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. That is my goal this year to prioritize my needs first.", "And, at the end of the day, I presume that these people who you've met briefly on a trip don't expect you to take them around the city all weekend.  Or you can make it clear that you do not expect to take them around the city.\n\nESH, because they shouldn't have gotten tickets without asking you, but you also shouldn't have offered if you didn't mean it.  I presume that some of the people on that trip had more than a one-bedroom.  It's tough to host people for a week when they are crashing on the couch and you have one bathroom between the four of you.", "Yeah, that was my initial quibble. I shouldn't have made the initial offer in the first place, but hindsight is 20/20. As an extrovert, it's something I thought I could accommodate, but ultimately could not. I do think she should have double checked my schedule and bandwidth before buying tickets. That being said, her feelings are valid, too, as I see two perspectives on this. \n\nAnd agreed that I need to more carefully think through what I agree to. In the future, I'm definitely not going to be making this offer again under any circumstances.", "Agreed. Soft YTA. Time for some damage control. \nIf you expected to be staying with others when you travel, then in all fairness you\u2019d be expected to reciprocate. If not, humbly explain that you didn\u2019t fully consider what you were committing to at the time and back out before you let down anyone else.", "Fr", "Yeah that was really strange to me. She sent me several messages saying she's coming for a week and asking for accommodations.", "NTA\n\nIt's your HOME. Your sanctuary. You deserve a place where you can go relax and recharge, and not have to be \"on\" all the time because you have guests. \n\nWhen you first start setting boundaries, it's normal to feel guilty. You're used to being accommodating and not putting a priority on yourself and your needs. It's a change for you, and a change for those around you. \n\nWhenever we make a change that is less convenient for others, they will push back. They, naturally, liked it the other way. But, their convenience does NOT trump your needs. \n\nThe thing is, they're only looking at one interaction: theirs. For them, it's the one trip. They're not seeing that you're doing this over and over and over and over, for tons of other people. Their vacation/break means NO break for you. \n\nNO ONE should be booking tickets before even \\*asking\\* you if they can stay with you. Even if you said \"oh, you can stay here any time\". They didn't check with you, it's on them. You don't \"owe\" them a place to stay. Will they be mad? Probably. Is that your fault? No. NO. The same way it wouldn't be a hotel's fault if they assumed they could get a room there and when they showed up, the hotel was full, or closed for the season, or under renovation, or sold. And you're a person, not a hotel.\n\nGuard your sanctuary.", "Yeah I think the 'no is a complete sentence' crowd really misses a lot of how human interaction works. It really is better to tell a white lie and say 'that week just doesn't work' or 'we have too much stuff going on' or 'they're fumigating' or whatever. People will get the message without feeling insulted. It feels a little silly but it really is better than going fully aggressive (like the other responder to this comment suggests).\n\nIt really can be difficult going from the 'people pleaser' mentality to the 'boundary setter mentality' because the healthy thing is somewhere in the middle and making that work relies a lot on intangible and unspoken communication that most people just sort of 'get' instinctively. If you struggle with that you're probably better off erring on the boundary side or you'll wear yourself out. But a lot of the psychotherapy-style boundary-setting was really meant to be for close, emotionally charged relationships, not as a wall against the world to keep yourself isolated, though that's how other people treated.\n\nBut yeah, no one in NYC has time for all the friends back home, and one of the great things is you can make tons of new friends because people are always looking to meet people, though that type of friendship has drawbacks too. Hope you enjoy the city :). People aren't so much good at drawing boundaries as they don't have the time to please everyone if they tried!", "We've only had to do it twice.  They took it well enough and understood.  At least to my face.  \"No, sorry.  We're not hosting.\"  I leave it at that.  I have a few pushy relatives I see at the holidays.  I've learned to keep it simple with \"No\".  With them, a weekend visit would easily turn into 5-7 days.  F that noise.\n\nFor you \"Sorry, we have a small apartment and busy work schedules.  We just can't entertain guests.\"\n\nDon't add caveats like \"right now\" or \"very long\".  That implies that you may host them in the future or they can stay for a night or two if they press the issue.", "That's understandable. I did genuinely mean it in my initial offer, but my boundaries changed in the interim months and more particularly with the last person who crashed at my place and really sucked the energy from me. That's when I realized I couldn't do this anymore. Also, I should clarify I don't remember if I actually offered my place or just told her to let me know if she's ever in the city. There were some girls I did offer this to as we were closer and the offer still stands, but I can't remember what I said to the specific people where the topic came up. I spoke to her for a total of maybe 30 minutes on the trip. \n\nThat being said, since she's asking to stay, I'm guessing I probably offered it. And in which case, yeah I did give my word and not keep it. And that's a fair assessment, which is why I feel bad about it and need to just deal with the feelings of that.", "So, the question is when will she come? Is it soon or later this year?\n\nI mean honestly, i would probably say something around the lines that you don't think that she can stay with you because you have a very hectic work week during that time? But that you might be available xy evening to have dinner together (or one activity) if you want. Otherwise I would just say that your workload is to heavy rn and you cannot say yet if you can hangout with her.", "They want to travel to NYC and blow all kinds of money. Don't feel bad, they can clearly afford a hotel.", "Wow thank you so much. This was very validating. I am a recovering people pleaser, and the transition has been hard. I do care about other people and have been an empath to my own detriment. But honestly, so many people have not done the same for me. And it's not even about what others are willing to do for me, but rather what my needs are in the moment. I think she would probably be very accommodating, but I just can't be right now. In any event, she responded and was actually very nice about it.", "I almost went into \"what about one day or two days\" territory, but then I realized I just want my home to myself. I won't even caveat it with that. \n\n5-7 days is so long. Absolutely not.", "Oh, man, so this could just be someone who heard you making an offer of a place to stay to someone you were closer to, and perhaps decided that they should ask to stay with you for a week?  Give an inch, take a yard?\n\nYeah, I understand your reluctance.  I wonder if you could let them stay for a couple days, but point out that any longer would be tough for you?  A week is a mighty big ask for a good friend when you have a guest bedroom, let alone someone you barely know sharing your one-bedroom!", "NTA - usually when people offer to let people crash they have a guest room. That\u2019s pretty rare in NY, or HKG, or other super-expensive real estate markets. It is entirely fair to say that you can\u2019t host people because you simply do not have a space for them. (Close family can be different, but also only for a weekend or something.) Did all those other people on the trip live in places with more living space? Cuz, yeah, who doesn\u2019t want a week in NY with a free room and a tour guide, but that\u2019s not your gig. It\u2019s ok, don\u2019t feel bad communicating to the whole group that you really can\u2019t host.", "***\"...someone already bought their tickets and asked if they could crash...\"***\n\nWell that was presumptuous on their part, if they were counting on the place to stay.\n\nJust say \"no.\" End of story.\n\nIf you have a hard time just saying \"no,\" then say \"I'd love to but we absolutely don't have room,\" which sounds to be totally true.\n\nOr just white lie... \"Oh would love to have you but boyfriend's cousin Earl and his girlfriend are staying for three weeks. It's soooo crowded. Honestly WE'RE almost looking for somewhere to escape to ourselves!\"\n\nNo one can make you play hotel.", "NTA - You are not responsible for someone booking tickets to your city without a place to stay.   Circumstances change.  We all know that.", "Info: did you ever take this group up on their hospitality?\n\nSome other randos abusing your hospitality doesn't void an expectation of reciprocity for a different set of people.", "Agreed. Thank you. The last person I hosted expected me to stay out late with them when I've communicated I wanted to go home. She just kept asking me what we're going to do next and pressuring me to stay out longer. She wanted to experience the city life to get the bang for her buck, which is not my problem. That's when I realized, being the person I am, I will feel the need to be a hospitable host so the solution is just to not invite people unless we're close.", "Thanks for these suggestions! I like that it's very succinct. I'll probably feel bad in the moment, but definitely need to try going for more direct answers.", "Thank you. It wasn't something I thought would happen, but happens every other week. I need to start setting these boundaries now.", "All the other people do live in smaller towns with bigger spaces. I'm the only one staying at a crowded place like NY/SF/LA. I do not have a guest room - only a couch and just one crammed spot between the couch and tv for an air mattress. Our bathroom is also tiny and I don't like sharing the bathroom.", "Agreed. And of course, people are always allowed to ask. She was gracious and kind in her response and respected my boundaries. You said, \"You are allowed to change your mind based on what is going on in your life.\" That's how I feel, though people are divided on that point here in that I made an offer and didn't keep my word. But yeah she did book the tickets without confirming first. There's no further context to that.", "No. I'm the only one who keeps getting requests due to my occupation and also because I live in nyc. I did not take anyone else up on their hospitality and do not plan to. If I visit someone, I'll just stay in my own hotel, as I do recognize the double standard if I did not reciprocate based on this post.", "Yep. That\u2019s how setting boundaries can feel in the beginning. It\u2019s normal. But remember that courage isn\u2019t not being scared. Courage is feeling terrified and sick and doing it anyway. Don\u2019t let your anxiety hold you back from taking care of yourself. Be brave. Acknowledge the feelings, accept them, but don\u2019t let them control you. You can do it.", "Yep. And my building has a card entry in addition to the apartment keys, so if I don't go out, I'm stuck getting woken up by someone calling from the street. Never again, except very close friends who don't expect me to take them around, but thank me with a nice dinner out one night instead!", "I don't expect to be staying with others, but it would be understandable to reciprocate if I did. In summary, I offered to spend time with her and show her around, but just that I can't offer my place. She responded though and was very nice about it. I don't think setting the boundary changed anything.", "Thank you so much. That is very validating. I didn't even think of it in terms of courage until you brought it up.", "Yeah, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I just let her know I would love to host her, but it's something my partner and I set boundaries on since it's a popular spot and a small space. And also that I'm happy to show her around and spend time with her. \n\nThat's reassuring. I've been working remotely, so it's taking time to make friends. But I'm sure it will manifest soon. I'm still new to the city, so I think this is the first step towards making time for new people.", "Lol she bought all these gifts for her family and friends, but didn't thank me and my partner really (not that we expect dinner or a gift but I guess it's what I do if any of my friends ever host me). Didn't act interested in anything we had to say. Didn't keep the apartment clean. Honestly that experience is what led to this post and setting boundaries. Fuck that shit.", "Tbf my work load is also heavy. So for the following reasons, it's getting unmanageable: (1) it's a small nyc apartment; (2) people keep asking cause it's a popular spot; (3) i'm busy; (4) people have expected me to host/show around the city and did not respect my boundaries when I wanted to do my own thing;   (5) my boyfriend does not want people over like this anymore; (6) the last person did not keep the space clean nor did they really even thank me properly for hosting them; and (7) I myself am burned out and don't want to do this anymore.", "Yeah it's very possible. There were a lot of people on the trip and it's hard to keep track of. It wasn't like a particularized interaction where I insisted any person should stay, but rather, if someone is coming to visit, I'm happy to show around. That was just the general vibe of the trip. There were 20 people and everyone was just saying let me know if you're ever in x city. So it wasn't like we were very bonded and I made the offer. \n\nAnd in any event, I did like hosting people at that time but now I just don't. So it's very possible I offered it and didn't realize in the future I would feel different."]}
