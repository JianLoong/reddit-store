The apartment is big enough to accommodate someone to stay in the living room, but it still feels cramped sharing a space. Since nyc is such a popular spot, we get requests almost every other week from people to crash at our place. \n\nAt first, we allowed people to stay. It\u2019s fine if close friends and family want to crash of course, but now people we don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll are asking. We recently had not the greatest experience with someone who I used to be friends with not really being gracious for our hospitality and expecting me to show them around the city. I\u2019ve realized hosting isn\u2019t just allowing people to crash, it also means I have to sacrifice my weekend to show people a good time. I am a very busy person and it\u2019s starting to get exhausting and take away from other things I would like to focus on. So we decided to set boundaries on this. \n\nSo last year when we first moved, I met several people on a trip where everyone was offering people to stay at their place from all over the world. I also offered because at the time I did not set that boundary or realize how much is involved. \n\nAnyway, someone already bought their tickets and asked if they could crash at my place and it seemed like she was asking for a week. I honestly don\u2019t know her that well and don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to host people just because the city is expensive. We are not a hotel and we work hard to afford our place. \n\nAnyway, I said at the time of the initial offer, I thought it was something we could accommodate but my partner and I have began to set boundaries on this. And it seems people will keep asking. Many of the other people from the trip are offering their place and meeting up after our initial meet up, which also makes me feel bad.

That will lead to some frictions, and it might cause you to drift apart from some of your old friends. It happens.\n\nPeople in this sub are *extremely* pro-boundaries, but setting boundaries also creates distance between people, as you're finding out. On the other hand you can't be everyone's tour guide every week, that's ridiculous. It's a balance.\n\nOne thing that I never see talked about here is the idea of 'saving face,' which is actually really important. When people set boundaries in the modern psychotherapy sense, they tend to phrase it as a rejection. 'We just can't take people in anymore,' or try to set a price. I don't know how you said it, but usually making an excuse that both sides know isn't really true is better than outright 'setting a boundary,' as they say.\n\nDon't feel guilty, but accept that there are consequences in terms of how people react to you. But don't worry - moving to NYC tends to involve getting out of sync with your old friends and building up your NYC friends instead, and it's often a transition for the better as people's live change in different ways.", "Hard NTA - your place, not a hotel. NYC is expensive and necessary to work hard there, and your time is valuable.

Longer than that is basically limited to my mom because she doesn't need me to entertain her.

We're literally a $2 ferry ride from party town, USA.  We would definitely allow certain family and friends stay in our guest room.  But that's it.  It's a standing invite (from us) only situation.  Anyone outside that circle of trust that asks gets an immediate \"no.\"  No explanation, no compromises.  Also, while we'd be happy to go out a time or two with them, we aren't employed at the tourism board.  Explore the city on your own and be mindful of my work from home days.", "NTA. I'm in exactly the same situation as you are. I'll let very close friends crash occasionally (close as in, I've crashed at their place and they don't expect me to play tour guide), but not friends of friends and whatnot. It's a lot of work and time and it's stressful. And no, I don't feel guilty about it.

The fact that you didn\u2019t realize the workload is a bit irrelevant; you actually made the offer and never rescinded it.  The problem is you actually invited them and nothing has materially changed other than your feelings.   No new kid, no family illness, etc.\n\nLiving in a popular tourist area myself, sometimes the requests were to have a place to crash, sometimes they were to visit and catch up, and sometimes they were wanted to do things with me.  \n\nOn their side, buying tickets without a prior conversation is also not good.

You are allowed to change your mind based on what is going on in your life.  What if you had a baby?  what if your parents were ill?  Things change.  you are allowed to say no.

It just doesn\u2019t work out for a longer visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe already have social engagements planned on the weekend, but if you are comfortable showing yourselves around the city, I\u2019ve got a guidebook I could lend you.\u201c\n\nPeople just don\u2019t understand how small New York City apartments can be\u2026.", "NTA. It's not your fault you are getting these requests from people you don't know. NTA at all", "It really is as simple as that.", "This also it's kind of stupid to book a ticket without confirming accomodations. Could be that you are away, someone else is staying there, living situation changed etc...", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel happier doing so, as my heart rate goes up and I feel a pit in my stomach. Wish it was easy to set boundaries and feel physically and mentally happy with the decision, but perhaps it will get better with repetition and time. Ultimately, the alternative is burning myself out for other people.", "Thanks, I\u2019ll keep that quote in mind during our transition.", "Wow thanks for your response. I have definitely seen a lot of rhetoric that \"no\" is a complete sentence. I don't see myself ever getting to that point, but respect everyone's approach. I gave a long explanation that, since we've moved, people have requested to stay our place almost every other week and it's something we've placed boundaries on. I also share a place with my partner, so I also have to respect that it's his space, too. But that I'm happy to look into a guest suite for her and that another girl from the trip wanted to visit so it could be an affordable and fun option for them to coordinate and share a space together. \n\nAnd complete agree, every time I've set boundaries, it has led to losing friends and causing tension. It helps knowing that forecast that I'll be more involved with NYC friends and it seems people here are very good at drawing boundaries. I also noticed that I only want to draw boundaries with people I don't want to waste my time and energy on. This girl is nice, which makes me feel guilty. But I'm not a hotel for every nice person I meet. \n\nThe problem is rooted in the fact that I also try to be nice to everyone I meet and have had people pleaser problems. I don't really enjoy setting boundaries ( (though hope I eventually do), but it's become very necessary with how crazy and busy my life is quickly becoming in the city/being particular with the company I choose to surround myself with.", "Thanks for letting me know. I honestly starting making explanations that perhaps she is flying over here to visit me, but my boyfriend thinks she is 100% just interested in getting free accommodations.", "That makes me feel better. People really are asking every week to every other week. Back in DC, people hardly visited so I enjoyed hosting. I really hate it now unless it's close friends.", "THANK YOU. Exactly. I love that you're setting the \"no explanation, no compromises\" boundary. I'm definitely going to keep that in mind. How do people take it when you say no?", "Thank you, I agree. I try to be hospitable, but trying to not do so to my own detriment and burnout.", "That's fair. I did actually offer to show her around the city and give a list of recommendations of my favorite spots, just that I can't accommodate people at my apartment at the moment. \n\nThat being said, I don't agree I have to have a new kid or family illness to justify this. What changed is that my partner has expressed to me that I can't have people over so often like this and also that the last person that stayed made hosting miserable for the both of us. It has led to me being burned out. When I initially offered, I actually did want to host people. These circumstances have led me to changing my mindset and I believe burnout is a justifiable reason. I don't know this person that well to go out of my way to inform them of this change (we spoke for maybe 30 minutes to an hour max on the trip). That would have been more awkward to me. \n\nI don't expect to be part of the travel group and also don't ask to stay at others' places anymore. Additionally, there were many requests people kept asking me in this group when they learned my occupation and, at this point, I am getting burned out addressing requests for people from a one-time trip. \n\nIn any event, she was very nice in her response, which I really appreciate.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. That is my goal this year to prioritize my needs first.", "And, at the end of the day, I presume that these people who you've met briefly on a trip don't expect you to take them around the city all weekend.  Or you can make it clear that you do not expect to take them around the city.\n\nESH, because they shouldn't have gotten tickets without asking you, but you also shouldn't have offered if you didn't mean it.  I presume that some of the people on that trip had more than a one-bedroom.  It's tough to host people for a week when they are crashing on the couch and you have one bathroom between the four of you.", "Yeah, that was my initial quibble. I shouldn't have made the initial offer in the first place, but hindsight is 20/20. As an extrovert, it's something I thought I could accommodate, but ultimately could not. I do think she should have double checked my schedule and bandwidth before buying tickets. That being said, her feelings are valid, too, as I see two perspectives on this. \n\nAnd agreed that I need to more carefully think through what I agree to. In the future, I'm definitely not going to be making this offer again under any circumstances.", "Agreed. Soft YTA. Time for some damage control. \nIf you expected to be staying with others when you travel, then in all fairness you\u2019d be expected to reciprocate. If not, humbly explain that you didn\u2019t fully consider what you were committing to at the time and back out before you let down anyone else.", "Fr", "Yeah that was really strange to me. She sent me several messages saying she's coming for a week and asking for accommodations.", "NTA\n\nIt's your HOME. Your sanctuary. You deserve a place where you can go relax and recharge, and not have to be \"on\" all the time because you have guests. \n\nWhen you first start setting boundaries, it's normal to feel guilty. You're used to being accommodating and not putting a priority on yourself and your needs. It's a change for you, and a change for those around you. \n\nWhenever we make a change that is less convenient for others, they will push back. They, naturally, liked it the other way. But, their convenience does NOT trump your needs. \n\nThe thing is, they're only looking at one interaction: theirs. For them, it's the one trip. They're not seeing that you're doing this over and over and over and over, for tons of other people. Their vacation/break means NO break for you. \n\nNO ONE should be booking tickets before even \\*asking\\* you if they can stay with you. Even if you said \"oh, you can stay here any time\". They didn't check with you, it's on them. You don't \"owe\" them a place to stay. Will they be mad? Probably. Is that your fault? No. NO. The same way it wouldn't be a hotel's fault if they assumed they could get a room there and when they showed up, the hotel was full, or closed for the season, or under renovation, or sold. And you're a person, not a hotel.\n\nGuard your sanctuary.", "Yeah I think the 'no is a complete sentence' crowd really misses a lot of how human interaction works. It really is better to tell a white lie and say 'that week just doesn't work' or 'we have too much stuff going on' or 'they're fumigating' or whatever. People will get the message without feeling insulted. It feels a little silly but it really is better than going fully aggressive (like the other responder to this comment suggests).\n\nIt really can be difficult going from the 'people pleaser' mentality to the 'boundary setter mentality' because the healthy thing is somewhere in the middle and making that work relies a lot on intangible and unspoken communication that most people just sort of 'get' instinctively. If you struggle with that you're probably better off erring on the boundary side or you'll wear yourself out. But a lot of the psychotherapy-style boundary-setting was really meant to be for close, emotionally charged relationships, not as a wall against the world to keep yourself isolated, though that's how other people treated.\n\nBut yeah, no one in NYC has time for all the friends back home, and one of the great things is you can make tons of new friends because people are always looking to meet people, though that type of friendship has drawbacks too. Hope you enjoy the city :). People aren't so much good at drawing boundaries as they don't have the time to please everyone if they tried!", "We've only had to do it twice.  They took it well enough and understood.  At least to my face.  \"No, sorry.  We're not hosting.\"  I leave it at that.  I have a few pushy relatives I see at the holidays.  I've learned to keep it simple with \"No\".  With them, a weekend visit would easily turn into 5-7 days.  F that noise.\n\nFor you \"Sorry, we have a small apartment and busy work schedules.  We just can't entertain guests.\"\n\nDon't add caveats like \"right now\" or \"very long\".  That implies that you may host them in the future or they can stay for a night or two if they press the issue.", "That's understandable. I did genuinely mean it in my initial offer, but my boundaries changed in the interim months and more particularly with the last person who crashed at my place and really sucked the energy from me. That's when I realized I couldn't do this anymore. Also, I should clarify I don't remember if I actually offered my place or just told her to let me know if she's ever in the city. There were some girls I did offer this to as we were closer and the offer still stands, but I can't remember what I said to the specific people where the topic came up. I spoke to her for a total of maybe 30 minutes on the trip. \n\nThat being said, since she's asking to stay, I'm guessing I probably offered it. And in which case, yeah I did give my word and not keep it. And that's a fair assessment, which is why I feel bad about it and need to just deal with the feelings of that.", "So, the question is when will she come? Is it soon or later this year?\n\nI mean honestly, i would probably say something around the lines that you don't think that she can stay with you because you have a very hectic work week during that time? But that you might be available xy evening to have dinner together (or one activity) if you want. Otherwise I would just say that your workload is to heavy rn and you cannot say yet if you can hangout with her.", "They want to travel to NYC and blow all kinds of money. Don't feel bad, they can clearly afford a hotel.", "Wow thank you so much. This was very validating. I am a recovering people pleaser, and the transition has been hard. I do care about other people and have been an empath to my own detriment. But honestly, so many people have not done the same for me. And it's not even about what others are willing to do for me, but rather what my needs are in the moment. I think she would probably be very accommodating, but I just can't be right now. In any event, she responded and was actually very nice about it.", "I almost went into \"what about one day or two days\" territory, but then I realized I just want my home to myself. I won't even caveat it with that. \n\n5-7 days is so long. Absolutely not.", "Oh, man, so this could just be someone who heard you making an offer of a place to stay to someone you were closer to, and perhaps decided that they should ask to stay with you for a week?  Give an inch, take a yard?\n\nYeah, I understand your reluctance.  I wonder if you could let them stay for a couple days, but point out that any longer would be tough for you?  A week is a mighty big ask for a good friend when you have a guest bedroom, let alone someone you barely know sharing your one-bedroom!", "NTA - usually when people offer to let people crash they have a guest room. That\u2019s pretty rare in NY, or HKG, or other super-expensive real estate markets. It is entirely fair to say that you can\u2019t host people because you simply do not have a space for them. (Close family can be different, but also only for a weekend or something.) Did all those other people on the trip live in places with more living space? Cuz, yeah, who doesn\u2019t want a week in NY with a free room and a tour guide, but that\u2019s not your gig. It\u2019s ok, don\u2019t feel bad communicating to the whole group that you really can\u2019t host.", "***\"...someone already bought their tickets and asked if they could crash...\"***\n\nWell that was presumptuous on their part, if they were counting on the place to stay.\n\nJust say \"no.\" End of story.\n\nIf you have a hard time just saying \"no,\" then say \"I'd love to but we absolutely don't have room,\" which sounds to be totally true.\n\nOr just white lie... \"Oh would love to have you but boyfriend's cousin Earl and his girlfriend are staying for three weeks. It's soooo crowded. Honestly WE'RE almost looking for somewhere to escape to ourselves!\"\n\nNo one can make you play hotel.", "NTA - You are not responsible for someone booking tickets to your city without a place to stay.   Circumstances change.  We all know that.", "Info: did you ever take this group up on their hospitality?\n\nSome other randos abusing your hospitality doesn't void an expectation of reciprocity for a different set of people.", "Agreed. Thank you. The last person I hosted expected me to stay out late with them when I've communicated I wanted to go home. She just kept asking me what we're going to do next and pressuring me to stay out longer. She wanted to experience the city life to get the bang for her buck, which is not my problem. That's when I realized, being the person I am, I will feel the need to be a hospitable host so the solution is just to not invite people unless we're close.", "Thanks for these suggestions! I like that it's very succinct. I'll probably feel bad in the moment, but definitely need to try going for more direct answers.", "Thank you. It wasn't something I thought would happen, but happens every other week. I need to start setting these boundaries now.", "All the other people do live in smaller towns with bigger spaces. I'm the only one staying at a crowded place like NY/SF/LA. I do not have a guest room - only a couch and just one crammed spot between the couch and tv for an air mattress. Our bathroom is also tiny and I don't like sharing the bathroom.", "Agreed. And of course, people are always allowed to ask. She was gracious and kind in her response and respected my boundaries. You said, \"You are allowed to change your mind based on what is going on in your life.\" That's how I feel, though people are divided on that point here in that I made an offer and didn't keep my word. But yeah she did book the tickets without confirming first. There's no further context to that.", "No. I'm the only one who keeps getting requests due to my occupation and also because I live in nyc. I did not take anyone else up on their hospitality and do not plan to. If I visit someone, I'll just stay in my own hotel, as I do recognize the double standard if I did not reciprocate based on this post.", "Yep. That\u2019s how setting boundaries can feel in the beginning. It\u2019s normal. But remember that courage isn\u2019t not being scared. Courage is feeling terrified and sick and doing it anyway. Don\u2019t let your anxiety hold you back from taking care of yourself. Be brave. Acknowledge the feelings, accept them, but don\u2019t let them control you. You can do it.", "Yep. And my building has a card entry in addition to the apartment keys, so if I don't go out, I'm stuck getting woken up by someone calling from the street. Never again, except very close friends who don't expect me to take them around, but thank me with a nice dinner out one night instead!", "I don't expect to be staying with others, but it would be understandable to reciprocate if I did. In summary, I offered to spend time with her and show her around, but just that I can't offer my place. She responded though and was very nice about it. I don't think setting the boundary changed anything.", "Thank you so much. That is very validating. I didn't even think of it in terms of courage until you brought it up.", "Yeah, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I just let her know I would love to host her, but it's something my partner and I set boundaries on since it's a popular spot and a small space. And also that I'm happy to show her around and spend time with her. \n\nThat's reassuring. I've been working remotely, so it's taking time to make friends. But I'm sure it will manifest soon. I'm still new to the city, so I think this is the first step towards making time for new people.", "Lol she bought all these gifts for her family and friends, but didn't thank me and my partner really (not that we expect dinner or a gift but I guess it's what I do if any of my friends ever host me). Didn't act interested in anything we had to say. Didn't keep the apartment clean. Honestly that experience is what led to this post and setting boundaries. Fuck that shit.", "Tbf my work load is also heavy. So for the following reasons, it's getting unmanageable: (1) it's a small nyc apartment; (2) people keep asking cause it's a popular spot; (3) i'm busy; (4) people have expected me to host/show around the city and did not respect my boundaries when I wanted to do my own thing;   (5) my boyfriend does not want people over like this anymore; (6) the last person did not keep the space clean nor did they really even thank me properly for hosting them; and (7) I myself am burned out and don't want to do this anymore.", "Yeah it's very possible. There were a lot of people on the trip and it's hard to keep track of. It wasn't like a particularized interaction where I insisted any person should stay, but rather, if someone is coming to visit, I'm happy to show around. That was just the general vibe of the trip. There were 20 people and everyone was just saying let me know if you're ever in x city. So it wasn't like we were very bonded and I made the offer. \n\nAnd in any event, I did like hosting people at that time but now I just don't. So it's very possible I offered it and didn't realize in the future I would feel different.", "NTA. And yes, I used to feel guilty when I set boundaries. So much so that it was hard for me to do it. But I learned to do it quickly, with few words, and in a cheerful but unapologetic tone. \"Nah, that wasn't working for us, so we don't do it anymore.\" That pit in the stomach goes away after a bit of practice. Sometimes people are kinda relieved to get a \"no\" that they can tell is not an invitation to keep asking.", "Personal growth and forming healthy boundaries is hard when you're not used to it. It feels uncomfortable and you feel guilty. But it's healthy and good to form these new skills, and it will get easier the more you do it. NTA", "NTA.  \n\n**You found that having guests doesn't work well for you.**  So, you are setting new boundaries and doing things differently now.  You do not need to explain this to other people.  All they need to know is that you aren't available.   Maybe you are available to only people that you invite, or only certain friends, or only certain relatives and not others.  It's all up to you two.  No one else. \n\n**\"Sorry, we aren't available for guests at this time.\"**  \n\nSome boundaries you just enforce, without explaining in full.  Some boundaries you might tell people, depending on the situation.  Some you never explain at all, because the other people don't need that information about you.  \n\n**\"Sorry, we aren't currently available for houseguests,** but would love to meet up if you are free Evening during your visit.\"   \n\nIf someone pushes, say \"Things have changed for us, and we aren't currently able to host.\"  If they push more, they are really very rude and you don't need to respond.\n\n**You are allowed to say no.**  You are allowed to say no **even if** your plans for the weekend are to build a new river farm in Stardew Valley and plant it all in blueberries.  This is your life, and you are allowed to make the decisions that work best for you.  Your needs and your wants are the priority for your life.  Not the wants of acquaintances that want you to save them money on hotels.  You need rest and relaxation in your life.  You need some lazy days and days that are filled with the small joys that make your life sweet to you.  This is important stuff, whether it's tea on the porch or marathoning Buffy or making your own pasta or whatever it is that you don't \"need\" to do, but it gives you joy.  Some things require leisure time to fully enjoy.  So, **you are allowed to say No.**  That's one of the good things about being an adult, being allowed, by yourself, to say No.  And **you are allowed to not explain your reasons.  Just repeat the statement that means no.**\n\nYes, learning to set boundaries is a guilt thing at first.  You will learn, and **the guilt will gradually leave.**  Practice this.  **The more you practice, the sooner the guilt will be gone**.", "NAH. From her point of view she made offers and got offers on a trip. Maybe she has already hosted some of them, maybe she visits others while traveling.  I can fully understand that you don't want to host anymore, but she her request is understandable, because you offered it to her. But she probably has other options, so you probably don't cause a big problem. But I hope she doesn't live in a nice spot, because now you can't take her up on her offer either.", "NTA- it doesn\u2019t sound like they were counting on it, but asked just in case. They may not realize you\u2019re not in the \u2018Friends\u2019 apartment. Or that even the Kimmy Schmidt apartment would be pretty awesome.\n\nBy the way, it just so happens I bought tickets to Manhattan right around your birthday. I forgot to budget for the hotel, so it\u2019s okay if I crash at your place, right? I\u2019m looking forward to getting the locals\u2019 experience!", "NTA. Boundaries can feel hard when you're not used to expressing and enforcing them, but ultimately, they will make you much happier and sane. It does get easier! If you ever get push back or someone is actually mean or rude because you've expressed a boundary, just know that their reaction is on them, not you. Mature adults will understand and know how to respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  You're allowed to not be a hostel, and you're even allowed to rescind a vague offer made a year previous.\n\nAnd yes, people who aren't used to setting boundaries often do feel guilty when they start.  They're used to being doormats.  I always recommend reading 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.'", "I think that\u2019s what I felt guilty about - that she already bought the tickets. But actually that is not my problem. She was nice in her response though and it doesn\u2019t seem like she is without a place to stay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever directly said no in this context. I said something along the lines of \u201cI absolutely would love to, but we recently placed boundaries on offering our place as an accommodation given the frequency of requests and limited space. I still would love to hang out and check out some spots while you\u2019re here and very excited you\u2019re visiting.\u201d", "Indeed. Circumstances change as well as perspectives and tolerances.", "I like that. I had a long apologetic explanation. But the goal is to get to a cheerful, succinct reason. Glad to know I wasn\u2019t the only one with the physical manifestation and that with time it\u2019ll go away.", "Thank you. I always look at those people who easily say no and prioritize themselves in complete awe wondering how they do it. They make it look easy, but I\u2019m sure it was a process. Hopefully it\u2019s just muscle memory with repetition.", "Thank you for taking the time to write such a beautiful response. It really resonated with me and makes me feel validated. I\u2019m going to print it and put it on my vision board as a reminder. \n\nI made offers to people as a different version of myself that really catered to others\u2019 needs, but my needs and boundaries are different as the person I am today. Despite being burned many times, I\u2019ve avoided saying no exactly to avoid the pit in my stomach and guilt when boundaries are drawn. But I think I can actually give back more to others, this world, and myself when I\u2019m very intentional about how I use my time, energy, and space and draw boundaries around that. \n\nThank you for telling me no is an answer. I\u2019ve grown up being taught otherwise and trying my best to navigate this uncharted territory.", "Her request is understandable. Hopefully I did not give off the impression that it wasn\u2019t. The post is moreso focused on my response. As far as whether she might have a nice place, like all things and risks in life, we win some we lose some.", "In the spirit of this post, \u201cno\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Um wow there\u2019s a literal book that describes exactly how I feel?! I am definitely reading this. Thanks for the rec! \n\nAnd yes, it does feel like a vague offer. I actually don\u2019t even fully remember if I made one lol.", "That's 100 percent fair. Some people are just better guests than others. It's also ok to say, \"you can crash with me but I don't have the energy/time to show you around.\" So they're very clear from the start.", "I used to almost cry about it, had to practice walking around the house saying nope, nada, ain't gonna happen to myself. It comes naturally now!", "Send her the link to a nearby hotel and tell her they should be able to set something up for her.", "There's also a (lack of) perspective issue too: your potential guests have no idea who else has been staying over, as they'd only know about their own itinerary. They don't have the awareness and context of the other guests and how having the non-stop visits from them on you is draining.  \n\n\nYou could set up a public google calendar to show the frequency but then again that might backfire \"well you let someone stay the weekend before, why not us too the next weekend?\" So better to not bother justifying it and just say you're busy and unavailable for those time periods.", "You should only offer 1-2 days for people that you know & trust. People you don\u2019t know very well can do stuff like \u201caccidentally\u201d missing their flight or \u201cforgetting to tell you\u201d they increased the length of their stay, because once they\u2019re already in your apartment, it\u2019s way harder to kick them out.", "Those points are all understandable and are good to remember for yourself, but I hope you don\u2019t think you need to go over them to anyone else to justify your choice.\n\nIf you start the JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) dance, then it turns into a debate rather than the simple fact that you aren\u2019t comfortable with it and won\u2019t be offering a place to stay", "Even without these reasons you still wouldn\u2019t be an AH. Even if you lived in a 10 bedroom mansion doesn\u2019t mean you have to accommodate anyone. Even if you decided to say no to this pro and yes to the next you still wouldn\u2019t be an AH. This is your space and yours/boyfriend\u2019s space alone, so no one should force themselves on you. Which is what this person seems to be doing by putting all parts of the trip in place and waiting till the very end to ask you. That puts you on the spot and that\u2019s not right in scenario. I myself travel a lot for medical reasons and I never ask anyone for a place to stay, even though I can\u2019t really afford it I always get a hotel. The only person I ever feel comfortable ask to stay with is my sister and we live in the same city and only invite myself over occasionally to spend time with her and my nibblings.", "Hey, I'd like to come to NYC, can I crash at your place? /s\n\nNTA", "You can always say, to anyone, \"I'm sorry, but that won't work for us,\" or, \"I'm sorry, but this isn't a good time.\" If it's someone you don't mind staying with you, but you won't be able to play hostess and take them around, you can simply tell them that: \"You're welcome to stay with us, but unfortunately, we won't be able to see much of you; things are very busy for us right now, so you'll have to be able to take care of yourself;\" if they don't seem to get it, explain that they will be responsible for [their own meals, getting around town, whatever it is you won't be able to do]. And if anyone ever makes a mess, say \"please clean up after yourself\" \u2013 and then stand there, looking right at them, and wait for them to start cleaning. If they don't, add \"I meant 'now' \u2013 please clean up after yourself *now*\" \u2013 and then *never, ever* let that person come through your door again. \n\nAll of these things can be said kindly, politely, even cheerfully, with a smile, and not one of them is rude.", "Yeah for sure. I don\u2019t blame her at all for asking. I know I will continue to be asked. That\u2019s actually what prompted this post in the first place. A few people are saying I offered so it\u2019s on me, but there\u2019s a lot of behind the scenes going on that have led to my burnout with this. I communicated that to her. I pretty much said \u201cwhen I initially offered, I thought I could accommodate people, but with the frequency of requests and limited space, it\u2019s no longer viable.\u201d I can\u2019t expect her to know what\u2019s going on in the background. And her response was understanding and respectful.", "Ooo thanks for the heads up on that. That\u2019s also my greatest qualm with having people that are not close stay. They\u2019re in the apartment so now you\u2019re stuck with that person that entire time. After this, I actually have a list of people I would let stay. That list itself will probably be someone visiting once a month. But with acquaintances, it was getting to be every other week.", "Yeah that\u2019s true. I initially did feel guilty, so I\u2019m sure there is a level of defensiveness. But the final verdict is that I don\u2019t feel guilty anymore. It was uncomfortable and I don\u2019t want to disappoint anyone, but I stand by my decision at this point.", "I\u2019m the same way. I generally don\u2019t ask people even when they offer. It\u2019s totally ok if people do, but it\u2019s something I try to keep to a minimum just because there is naturally a pressure the other person feels to agree to host and to tend to me, unless I know them really well and they\u2019re close friends and family. My home is my sanctuary and I know other people feel that way about theirs. A two day weekend trip is max for me.", "No \ud83d\ude09", "See how easy that was! J/K!", "Hahaha I wish", "NTA - Good for you for figuring out your boundaries and sticking to them. It is hard to do if you are not used to it. I understand the guilt feelings though, as a person who is always trying to please others. Recently setting boundaries by not allowing someone in my life to speak to me brutally and abusively. You are setting a good example for all of us working on this issue.", "NTA..\n\nYou are allowed to say NO.", "A week is way too long in a cramped space,  especially when you barely know them. NTA", "NTA. To help set boundaries I\u2019ve found it useful to think in third person. So if your name is Sally, think \u2018does Sally want this person staying a week?\u2019 \u2018No Sally does not.\u2019  Treat yourself well!!", "NTA\n\nAlso be aware in case unwanted guest shows up anyway expecting accommodation counting on you not turning them down since they are there at your place. Answer is still a resounding NO!\n\nI say that because someone posted that they live in a tourist area and get many requests to stay at their place, both of them wfh and need to stay focused on their work so always say no to all requests. An acquaintance asked to stay with them because their vacation would be in their city. Acquaintance was told no. From their office work area they can see their front door, doorbell went off and lo and behold who is standing there with luggage, the acquaintance who was told no. They didn't answer their door or phones from acquaintance who eventually went away.", "NTA. I've been to NYC for vacation. I stayed in a cheap hotel that sucked but it was okay because I went out all day. I used a guidebook to find my way around the city. You don't know these people. It doesn't sound like they're real friends. You can say no as often as you want. If they can afford a trip to NYC they could probably afford to stay in one of those hostels where they'd share a room with other travelers.", "NTA \n\nWe have visited friends in far away places a few times and always stayed with them, but made it clear that we were happy to get hotels as I have manners. No one is obligated to play host, particularly as those people expected free tour guides, too, which is weird to me in all honesty.", "NTA\n\nIts your home. If you do not want folks to crash there anymore. You do not have to let them. Enough said. \n\n\nIf you feel you need an excuse. Use health and work. But honestly, just say no, it is not a good time for that.", "This. OP, just say, \"I'm sorry, our place isn't available that week.\" And keep saying that. I wouldn't say you set a boundary about people staying with you, just tell people it isn't available.", "Thank you for sharing. I am so sorry that happened to you. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy for you to put up boundaries with this person, especially if they\u2019re abusive and I\u2019m guessing has a hard time accepting your boundaries. You don\u2019t deserve that and I\u2019m happy you\u2019re taking this important step to prioritize yourself and your feelings over this person. Don\u2019t let them ever make you question your position. You know your truth best.", "Point blank period.", "Ok that\u2019s pretty terrifying. That\u2019s a smoking red flag. And honestly very creepy. Good of them to not pick up. \n\nI\u2019m at the point of defaulting to no accommodations unless they\u2019re on my predetermined list.", "Same. Back when I couldn\u2019t afford it, I just stayed in a Brooklyn Airbnb. Also, I didn\u2019t even ask some of my best friends because their apartments were very small. Even if they didn\u2019t say it, it would have been really cramped. I started to realize that even tho my apartment isn\u2019t tiny, it\u2019s still cramped. At the end of the day, it\u2019s still a nyc apartment.", "Girl, you should stop saying yes and start saying no, with no explanation. It's your HOME, not an aribnb, nobody is entitled to stay at your place just because you live somewhere touristy. If setting boundaries is hard for you, ask yourself if any of these people would accommodate you if the roles were reversed, I bet they probably wouldn't. It boggles my mind how you say people you barely know or don't know very well just invite yourself over to your house. Do they pay any money for the electricity, water, cleaning etc? Do they do any cleaning themselves for the space they used? \n\nIf they booked a flight to NYC, it's their problem to find accommodation, not yours. Also, you are not a tourist guide, so if you sacrifice your personal space and free time to show people around every weekend, and you have nothing to gain from it, you should just say no and leave it at that. Imagine the first few weekends after you stop letting people stay at your place, you won't even think twice about saying no and you certainly won't feel guilty.", "I'm gonna be honest here and it might sound rude, but I don't care what reasons you have. It's your and your partner's appartment. If you don't want to host people that's reason enough. \n\nAlso,. someone booking a ticket without checking with you is very assholish. I'm literally in the situation where I'm booking a trip to visit friends and you betcha I checked/double-checked and guess what? Triple checked before booking flights to go there. \n\nYou are completely in the right. Stuff changes, life changes and not everyone can just fulfill a very general promise made in a group.", "I like how you laid this out. My household taught me to bend over backwards for guests, but honestly fuck that. I\u2019ll call each behavior as I see it. And honestly, each time I permit something, it just signals more boundaries can be crossed.", "Not rude at all. Honestly, you\u2019re so right, I don\u2019t even need to outline all these reasons. The seventh one is enough. \n\nI would double check too, especially on timing. People\u2019s lives change all the time.", "\"Sorry, I have other plans\" is a good answer and could mean anything from having other guests, being away yourselfes, working all weekend, to \"I'm binging Star Wars in my underwear\". You don't need to explain, you just have plans.", "There you go! Look, I get it, it's hard to say no and people can be selfish. But you didn't make a promise to host a specific person at a specific time in the future. You promised to open up your house if possible. Well, turns out it's not possible for you at this point in time under these conditions. \n\nMore importantly, it being possible or not possible is your decision to make. Unless your guest wants to take over the mortgage/rent and call the shots. Which i highly doubt.", "Yeah exactly, I\u2019m trying to allow myself the space to evolve in my mindset and stay attuned to what my needs are. Previous me would have been like, well it\u2019s not a big ask to have someone stay. But it actually is. At least for me at this point in time. And it\u2019s these small excuses I\u2019ve been making to accommodate others that\u2019s making me lose myself and on bigger things.", "NTA. If anyone asks, just tell them yours and your bf\u2019s circumstances have changed, and you\u2019re no longer able to host. Period. No one deserves an explanation.\n\nYes, I used to feel guilty when I set boundaries, but over time I\u2019ve found it very empowering.", "NTA - personal space is an important boundary", "Recommend couch surfing to them. \n\nDon't feel bad. I wouldn't like this either but some do. \nThat'll find something\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself. Just sorry we\u2019re not able to host you, but maybe we can meet up during your visit", "First of all, NTA.\n\nSecond, I want to say that acquaintances, relatives, and \u2018old friends\u2019 are usually the worst offenders.\n\nThird, and on a personal note, take a moment and simmer on it, because friends you meet on trips can be the kind of lifelong friends you\u2019d never meet in regular circumstances. You have short but similar life experiences for a moment and it brings you together. And the fact that the offer has also been extended in return, might be one you could take up in return.", "That\u2019s true. Generally when I set boundaries, they respect it. People usually are not mean when I do so, but sometimes they do peer pressure or gaslight me on the validity of my boundary. When that\u2019s the case, I know they don\u2019t respect me and are not a true friend. They\u2019re also experimenting what I\u2019m willing to tolerate and typically that\u2019s a red flag that I\u2019m in an imbalanced and inauthentic relationship.", "If I\u2019ve taken anything from this post, it\u2019s to just say no.", "Wow I love that you framed it as empowering. And that\u2019s how I\u2019ll view my decision today.", "Honestly, looking at how much I permitted with the last guest after posting this. I stayed my boundaries that I\u2019m personally tired and don\u2019t want to go out anymore, and she kept insisting I can go a bit more with just some tequila. I shouldn\u2019t have taken that shot and gone home. I\u2019m not a tour guide and not responsible for her seeing what she needs to see on vacation.", "It absolutely is. I\u2019ll start writing a list of all the other boundaries that are important that I\u2019ve overlooked.", "That\u2019s my next milestone in the boundaries journey: Declining in a single sentence.", "Exactly!! You should send some of those people a copy of Miss Manners or something. Ridiculous.", "Forget accommodations, this is what I want to say to everyone with their requests lol. \u201cI just do not have the energy nor the time for this. You\u2019re on your own kid.\u201d", "Actually you are so very right. People generally have not done the same for me that I\u2019m willing to do for them. It\u2019s the saying no with no explanation part that\u2019s hard for me. But I guess you\u2019re making me question why I feel the need to have an explanation in the first place. If I don\u2019t owe them anything, I don\u2019t owe them an explanation either.", "To top it off, my boyfriend made us massaman chicken for breakfast and she did not say thank you, she just asked what we\u2019re doing next. We literally were so relieved when she was gone. Sending her a copy of the miss manners brochure stat.", "Think about it this way, you and your bf pay rent to live there and every weekend you have a third person sharing the space with you without paying you anything (that's what I understood from your post). Those are some expenses on your part, even if you don't directly pay anything upfront, think about the utilities and cleaning, especially the latter since crammed spaces usually get messy really fast. Life is expensive right now and people should not expect that you can host them for free. Most importantly, it costs you your peace of mind. If you charge them money, your peace is still more important. Me, my bf and his mom have been in a similarish situation, I won't get into details, but it was the same people coming over (not staying the night though) and we put up some boundaries and stopped letting them come over, even if they 'urgently' needed something, and it was sooo much better after. They would come at noon because they needed to do their laundry and would not leave even after giving them hints them seeing we were busy until late in the evening. Again, I won't get into details cause I don't want to sound like an asshole, but trust me, just say no and you won't regret it.", "Good for you that you set up those boundaries. I set a boundary with my boyfriend that I can\u2019t have either of our parents living with us ever. I\u2019ve also had a friend who let someone stay at their place for literally a year and a half because they never drew the boundary for him to leave. He wasn\u2019t going to until they did. Also, whoever those people are that are coming at noon, sounds like they\u2019re full of bs and just not respectful of your place.", "Love it. Honestly, I was thinking of what could be a good response and that\u2019s perfect. \u201cUnfortunately, I have other plans that weekend. Hope you have a great time in the city!\u201d Bam."]}
