The apartment is big enough to accommodate someone to stay in the living room, but it still feels cramped sharing a space. Since nyc is such a popular spot, we get requests almost every other week from people to crash at our place. \n\nAt first, we allowed people to stay. It\u2019s fine if close friends and family want to crash of course, but now people we don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll are asking. We recently had not the greatest experience with someone who I used to be friends with not really being gracious for our hospitality and expecting me to show them around the city. I\u2019ve realized hosting isn\u2019t just allowing people to crash, it also means I have to sacrifice my weekend to show people a good time. I am a very busy person and it\u2019s starting to get exhausting and take away from other things I would like to focus on. So we decided to set boundaries on this. \n\nSo last year when we first moved, I met several people on a trip where everyone was offering people to stay at their place from all over the world. I also offered because at the time I did not set that boundary or realize how much is involved. \n\nAnyway, someone already bought their tickets and asked if they could crash at my place and it seemed like she was asking for a week. I honestly don\u2019t know her that well and don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility to host people just because the city is expensive. We are not a hotel and we work hard to afford our place. \n\nAnyway, I said at the time of the initial offer, I thought it was something we could accommodate but my partner and I have began to set boundaries on this. And it seems people will keep asking. Many of the other people from the trip are offering their place and meeting up after our initial meet up, which also makes me feel bad. She saw my messages and didn\u2019t respond. I feel guilty about this and feel a pit in my stomach every time I say no. Should I?

Time to set your boundary fences up.", "NTA, don't feel guilty, partly it's New York but also you're just getting older and you're not 20-year-old crashing on couches with the cheapest pizza and beer you can find anymore. That will lead to some frictions, and it might cause you to drift apart from some of your old friends. It happens.\n\nPeople in this sub are *extremely* pro-boundaries, but setting boundaries also creates distance between people, as you're finding out. On the other hand you can't be everyone's tour guide every week, that's ridiculous. It's a balance.\n\nOne thing that I never see talked about here is the idea of 'saving face,' which is actually really important. When people set boundaries in the modern psychotherapy sense, they tend to phrase it as a rejection. 'We just can't take people in anymore,' or try to set a price. I don't know how you said it, but usually making an excuse that both sides know isn't really true is better than outright 'setting a boundary,' as they say.\n\nDon't feel guilty, but accept that there are consequences in terms of how people react to you. But don't worry - moving to NYC tends to involve getting out of sync with your old friends and building up your NYC friends instead, and it's often a transition for the better as people's live change in different ways.", "Hard NTA - your place, not a hotel. NYC is expensive and necessary to work hard there, and your time is valuable. Further, while NYC is expensive to live in, Airbnb\u2019s can be really affordable and it\u2019s incredibly easy to explore on your own as a tourist. No shame, it sounds like your friends and acquaintances are trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA Yeah, I get it. I have a small 1 bdrm in manhattan. And a friend visiting for the weekend is fine. Longer than that is basically limited to my mom because she doesn't need me to entertain her. And she understands that it's a 1 bdrm so that it's really valuable for her to leave at points during the day so I can have alone time.", "\"AITA?\"\n\nNo, NTA\n\n\"have any of you felt guilty when you began setting boundaries?\"\n\nNo.  I live in a VERY touristy city in the southern USA. We're literally a $2 ferry ride from party town, USA.  We would definitely allow certain family and friends stay in our guest room.  But that's it.  It's a standing invite (from us) only situation.  Anyone outside that circle of trust that asks gets an immediate \"no.\"  No explanation, no compromises.  Also, while we'd be happy to go out a time or two with them, we aren't employed at the tourism board.  Explore the city on your own and be mindful of my work from home days.", "NTA. I'm in exactly the same situation as you are. I'll let very close friends crash occasionally (close as in, I've crashed at their place and they don't expect me to play tour guide), but not friends of friends and whatnot. It's a lot of work and time and it's stressful. And no, I don't feel guilty about it. If others want to host people every weekend, let them; it doesn't mean you should feel guilty about something that doesn't work for you.", "NTA.  No one has any obligation to have guests.  Especially people they don't know well.", "The problem isn\u2019t you setting boundaries.  You have every right to do that.  The fact that you didn\u2019t realize the workload is a bit irrelevant; you actually made the offer and never rescinded it.  The problem is you actually invited them and nothing has materially changed other than your feelings.   No new kid, no family illness, etc.\n\nLiving in a popular tourist area myself, sometimes the requests were to have a place to crash, sometimes they were to visit and catch up, and sometimes they were wanted to do things with me.  \n\nOn their side, buying tickets without a prior conversation is also not good.  You could have been out of town, had a family emergency, already had other guests, etc.\n\nESH.\n\nBut, you can\u2019t expect to fully be a part of the fun travel group where everyone shares when you don\u2019t.  That is the price of belonging to that group.  You are either ok with that or you share.  And your style here seems a bit awkward.  You could have simply said, we are unable to accommodate guests but would love to treat you to breakfast at (pick great location outside of your condo)!

If you jumped on the bandwagon during that trip and glibly offered up your place for crashing in NYC, you should accept the consequences.

But, you can't go back on your word with someone.", "NAH\n\nEven if you were comfortable with this person staying, it sounds like they didn't confirm with you that you had accommodations available before they made their plans/ booked their tickets.  Unless I am misunderstanding something here.  What if you already have someone staying there?  People aren't just entitled to someone elses living space because they offered at one time.,  Life happens, things change.  You are allowed to change your mind based on what is going on in your life.  What if you had a baby?  what if your parents were ill?  Things change.  you are allowed to say no.  It's okay, and I don't think you should feel guilty.\n\nI am also not sure they did anything wrong... They are allowed to ask, right?  unless they are starting shit.  I really don't think either of you are TA.\n\nEDIT: Grammar", "Eh. Soft YTA.

It just doesn\u2019t work out for a longer visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe already have social engagements planned on the weekend, but if you are comfortable showing yourselves around the city, I\u2019ve got a guidebook I could lend you.\u201c\n\nPeople just don\u2019t understand how small New York City apartments can be\u2026.", "NTA. It's not your fault you are getting these requests from people you don't know. NTA at all", "It really is as simple as that.", "This also it's kind of stupid to book a ticket without confirming accomodations. Could be that you are away, someone else is staying there, living situation changed etc...", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t feel happier doing so, as my heart rate goes up and I feel a pit in my stomach. Wish it was easy to set boundaries and feel physically and mentally happy with the decision, but perhaps it will get better with repetition and time. Ultimately, the alternative is burning myself out for other people.", "Thanks, I\u2019ll keep that quote in mind during our transition.", "Wow thanks for your response. I have definitely seen a lot of rhetoric that \"no\" is a complete sentence. I don't see myself ever getting to that point, but respect everyone's approach. I gave a long explanation that, since we've moved, people have requested to stay our place almost every other week and it's something we've placed boundaries on. I also share a place with my partner, so I also have to respect that it's his space, too. But that I'm happy to look into a guest suite for her and that another girl from the trip wanted to visit so it could be an affordable and fun option for them to coordinate and share a space together. \n\nAnd complete agree, every time I've set boundaries, it has led to losing friends and causing tension. It helps knowing that forecast that I'll be more involved with NYC friends and it seems people here are very good at drawing boundaries. I also noticed that I only want to draw boundaries with people I don't want to waste my time and energy on. This girl is nice, which makes me feel guilty. But I'm not a hotel for every nice person I meet. \n\nThe problem is rooted in the fact that I also try to be nice to everyone I meet and have had people pleaser problems. I don't really enjoy setting boundaries ( (though hope I eventually do), but it's become very necessary with how crazy and busy my life is quickly becoming in the city/being particular with the company I choose to surround myself with.", "Thanks for letting me know. I honestly starting making explanations that perhaps she is flying over here to visit me, but my boyfriend thinks she is 100% just interested in getting free accommodations.", "That makes me feel better. People really are asking every week to every other week. Back in DC, people hardly visited so I enjoyed hosting. I really hate it now unless it's close friends.", "THANK YOU. Exactly. I love that you're setting the \"no explanation, no compromises\" boundary. I'm definitely going to keep that in mind. How do people take it when you say no?", "Thank you, I agree. I try to be hospitable, but trying to not do so to my own detriment and burnout.", "That's fair. I did actually offer to show her around the city and give a list of recommendations of my favorite spots, just that I can't accommodate people at my apartment at the moment. \n\nThat being said, I don't agree I have to have a new kid or family illness to justify this. What changed is that my partner has expressed to me that I can't have people over so often like this and also that the last person that stayed made hosting miserable for the both of us. It has led to me being burned out. When I initially offered, I actually did want to host people. These circumstances have led me to changing my mindset and I believe burnout is a justifiable reason. I don't know this person that well to go out of my way to inform them of this change (we spoke for maybe 30 minutes to an hour max on the trip). That would have been more awkward to me. \n\nI don't expect to be part of the travel group and also don't ask to stay at others' places anymore. Additionally, there were many requests people kept asking me in this group when they learned my occupation and, at this point, I am getting burned out addressing requests for people from a one-time trip. \n\nIn any event, she was very nice in her response, which I really appreciate.", "Thank you, I appreciate that. That is my goal this year to prioritize my needs first.", "And, at the end of the day, I presume that these people who you've met briefly on a trip don't expect you to take them around the city all weekend.  Or you can make it clear that you do not expect to take them around the city.\n\nESH, because they shouldn't have gotten tickets without asking you, but you also shouldn't have offered if you didn't mean it.  I presume that some of the people on that trip had more than a one-bedroom.  It's tough to host people for a week when they are crashing on the couch and you have one bathroom between the four of you.", "Yeah, that was my initial quibble. I shouldn't have made the initial offer in the first place, but hindsight is 20/20. As an extrovert, it's something I thought I could accommodate, but ultimately could not. I do think she should have double checked my schedule and bandwidth before buying tickets. That being said, her feelings are valid, too, as I see two perspectives on this. \n\nAnd agreed that I need to more carefully think through what I agree to. In the future, I'm definitely not going to be making this offer again under any circumstances.", "Agreed. Soft YTA. Time for some damage control. \nIf you expected to be staying with others when you travel, then in all fairness you\u2019d be expected to reciprocate. If not, humbly explain that you didn\u2019t fully consider what you were committing to at the time and back out before you let down anyone else.", "Fr", "Yeah that was really strange to me. She sent me several messages saying she's coming for a week and that she wants to see broadway, comedy shows, etc., and asking for accommodations. She also sent the group chat a message (not specifically to me) that she would like accommodations since she plans to visit nyc. I didn't respond to that, but it just makes me feel she is just reaching out to me for that purpose (and maybe a small extent to hang with people from the trip).", "NTA\n\nIt's your HOME. Your sanctuary. You deserve a place where you can go relax and recharge, and not have to be \"on\" all the time because you have guests. \n\nWhen you first start setting boundaries, it's normal to feel guilty. You're used to being accommodating and not putting a priority on yourself and your needs. It's a change for you, and a change for those around you. \n\nWhenever we make a change that is less convenient for others, they will push back. They, naturally, liked it the other way. But, their convenience does NOT trump your needs. \n\nThe thing is, they're only looking at one interaction: theirs. For them, it's the one trip. They're not seeing that you're doing this over and over and over and over, for tons of other people. Their vacation/break means NO break for you. \n\nNO ONE should be booking tickets before even \\*asking\\* you if they can stay with you. Even if you said \"oh, you can stay here any time\". They didn't check with you, it's on them. You don't \"owe\" them a place to stay. Will they be mad? Probably. Is that your fault? No. NO. The same way it wouldn't be a hotel's fault if they assumed they could get a room there and when they showed up, the hotel was full, or closed for the season, or under renovation, or sold. And you're a person, not a hotel.\n\nGuard your sanctuary.", "Yeah I think the 'no is a complete sentence' crowd really misses a lot of how human interaction works. It really is better to tell a white lie and say 'that week just doesn't work' or 'we have too much stuff going on' or 'they're fumigating' or whatever. People will get the message without feeling insulted. It feels a little silly but it really is better than going fully aggressive (like the other responder to this comment suggests).\n\nIt really can be difficult going from the 'people pleaser' mentality to the 'boundary setter mentality' because the healthy thing is somewhere in the middle and making that work relies a lot on intangible and unspoken communication that most people just sort of 'get' instinctively. If you struggle with that you're probably better off erring on the boundary side or you'll wear yourself out. But a lot of the psychotherapy-style boundary-setting was really meant to be for close, emotionally charged relationships, not as a wall against the world to keep yourself isolated, though that's how other people treated.\n\nBut yeah, no one in NYC has time for all the friends back home, and one of the great things is you can make tons of new friends because people are always looking to meet people, though that type of friendship has drawbacks too. Hope you enjoy the city :). People aren't so much good at drawing boundaries as they don't have the time to please everyone if they tried!", "We've only had to do it twice.  They took it well enough and understood.  At least to my face.  \"No, sorry.  We're not hosting.\"  I leave it at that.  I have a few pushy relatives I see at the holidays.  I've learned to keep it simple with \"No\".  With them, a weekend visit would easily turn into 5-7 days.  F that noise.\n\nFor you \"Sorry, we have a small apartment and busy work schedules.  We just can't entertain guests.\"\n\nDon't add caveats like \"right now\" or \"very long\".  That implies that you may host them in the future or they can stay for a night or two if they press the issue.", "That's understandable. I did genuinely mean it in my initial offer, but my boundaries changed in the interim months and more particularly with the last person who crashed at my place and really sucked the energy from me. That's when I realized I couldn't do this anymore. Also, I should clarify I don't remember if I actually offered my place or just told her to let me know if she's ever in the city. There were some girls I did offer this to as we were closer and the offer still stands, but I can't remember what I said to the specific people where the topic came up. I spoke to her for a total of maybe 30 minutes on the trip. \n\nThat being said, since she's asking to stay, I'm guessing I probably offered it. And in which case, yeah I did give my word and not keep it. And that's a fair assessment, which is why I feel bad about it and need to just deal with the feelings of that.", "So, the question is when will she come? Is it soon or later this year?\n\nI mean honestly, i would probably say something around the lines that you don't think that she can stay with you because you have a very hectic work week during that time? But that you might be available xy evening to have dinner together (or one activity) if you want. Otherwise I would just say that your workload is to heavy rn and you cannot say yet if you can hangout with her.", "They want to travel to NYC and blow all kinds of money. Don't feel bad, they can clearly afford a hotel.", "Wow thank you so much. This was very validating. I am a recovering people pleaser, and the transition has been hard. I do care about other people and have been an empath to my own detriment. But honestly, so many people have not done the same for me. And it's not even about what others are willing to do for me, but rather what my needs are in the moment. I think she would probably be very accommodating, but I just can't be right now. In any event, she responded and was actually very nice about it.", "I almost went into \"what about one day or two days\" territory, but then I realized I just want my home to myself. I won't even caveat it with that. \n\n5-7 days is so long. Absolutely not.", "Oh, man, so this could just be someone who heard you making an offer of a place to stay to someone you were closer to, and perhaps decided that they should ask to stay with you for a week?  Give an inch, take a yard?\n\nYeah, I understand your reluctance.  I wonder if you could let them stay for a couple days, but point out that any longer would be tough for you?  A week is a mighty big ask for a good friend when you have a guest bedroom, let alone someone you barely know sharing your one-bedroom!"]}
