It's either that or our moms studied from the same playbook.  It's classic controlling/narcissist behavior.

Not I'm sorry for what I said? Stay far away from her. She hasn't changed.", "NTA.\n\nYou're an adult, and you have the absolute right to the relationships you WANT in your life.\n\nYou don't owe your mother a thing.  If she wanted a positive relationship with you, she should have nurtured one during your childhood.", "Cut the Aunt out while you're at it.", "Nta she should really care more about how you feel and what\u2019s led to this whole situation", "NTA.  You are entitled to set your own boundaries.  Your mom does not have to like them, but she should respect them.  As should others, including your aunt.  \n\nI say this as a parent:  When you are old enough to make your own choices and draw your own boundaries, you do not *owe* your parent anything\u2014not your time, not your energy, not your space.  No one is entitled to have access to you.  Her feeling hurt does not change this.  Her having raised you and done X, Y, Z for you growing up doesn\u2019t change this.  As your parent, she doesn\u2019t get credit for doing what a parent is *supposed* to do.  \n\nYou may want to check out r/justnomil, lots of good people and support over there.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour mother is reaping the consequences of her actions.\n\nShe thought she could bully you forever. When she found out she was wrong, only THEN did she realize she'd gone too far.\n\nThe decision whether or not to have a relationship with her is solely yours. \n\nJust because you share blood with someone doesn't mean you must have a relationship with them.\n\n(and also, I'd assume your aunt has no idea how bad it was, and is only hearing your mother's \"poor me\" victim story, so I wouldn't listen too much to her opinion).\n\nGood luck, OP - you sound like you've done exactly what you should - moved out and moved on. Please come back and let us know how you're doing!", "NTA\n\nDon't let any family guilt-trip you. Whether you have a relationship with your mother or not is up to you alone.\n\nThe most I would personally do is CONSIDER catching up with her at some point in a neutral, public location, and letting her say her piece. That way you can decide if you want to forgive her or have some form of contact, and *no one in your family can say you didn't give her a chance*\n\nBut in all honesty, even that is probably not worth it. You owe her nothing, not a single thing. Just focus on your own happiness and don't feel guilty for a second", "NTA. I dont know why she is complaining. \u201cother people have it worse.\u201d", "Nope!", "NTA, I am very sorry you had to go through this horrible experience and not have the love and support you deserved. I hope you are either in therapy or looking for a therapist because to get to a better place, you could really use some help. \n\nAnother Redditor noted that she didn't apologize for what she said, just that she didn't mean it. Unless your mother had therapy or a miraculous realization of her mistakes and wrongdoings, she is only trying to save face so she doesn't look like the monster. DO NOT MEET WITH HER IN A PLACE YOU CAN NOT GET OUT OF QUICKLY. I would only communicate, if you want to, via text.\n\nPlease find the subreddit of people who have had abusive mothers for support. You are sadly not alone in your experience, and you shouldn't feel isolated or by yourself. You can connect with a world of people who sadly have a shitty parent.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t mean anything she said or did for seventeen years, she\u2019s insane. If she did and this is a lie\u2014the more likely scenario by FAR\u2014she\u2019s a narcissist trying to get her claws back into you. Staying far away is the best path forward, but don\u2019t be surprised if she tries to ambush you to try and pull you back into her orbit.", "OP, I am someone who has been NC (No Contact) with my parents on and off for years. I've currently gone one full year without speaking to any of them, with a boundary holding up with the rest of the family that I will not discuss them with anyone. \n\nNTA, but I want to talk a little bit about how guilt is probably going to work with the rest of your family. \n\nYou moved out - awesome! Are you financially independent from all of your family? Do you control your own phone bill? \n\nI put all my family (sans a few) on mute. I didn't block them, but I don't get notified immediately when they call or message. I also ensured I had my own transportation any time I'm dealing with them. Being able to walk out and leave is an important situation. \n\nYou may never want to speak to your mother again. You may want to try and reconcile down the road. No matter your choice, it is your choice. If anyone is calling you terrible, try saying the following, \"You did not experience being her daughter. I did. If I'm a terrible daughter, she's a terrible mother. I will speak to her when and if I'm ready, and if you keep pushing this, I will stop speaking with you.\" And stand your ground. \n\nYour aunt is speaking with you like this because your mom is probably in her ear and annoying her about it. It took me cutting off my grandparents for months for them to realize I was serious. Do not discuss my parents with me, do not guilt me. It will not go well. \n\nGood luck, OP. And again, NTA", "NTA.

You have escaped an abusive mother and you are not TA for not subjecting yourself to her again any time soon.  Your mother is likely a person who would benefit a great deal from some long term therapy with a good psychologist. Maybe some she would be able to acknowledge the specific things she said and did that were cruel, maybe not. I don\u2019t know the psychological term for someone so ignorant that she can\u2019t comprehend (or maybe she didn\u2019t care) how negatively she was affecting her daughter with her anger issues, her yelling, her criticism, her verbal abuse \u2014 but your mother seems to be that person.
