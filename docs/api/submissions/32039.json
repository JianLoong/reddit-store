I brought my boyfriend [33M] of 3 years. This was the second time I bring him to a family event. He came last year for Christmas as well. He gets along fine with my family. He especially gets along well with my grandpa and my uncle as his family is from the same small town that my family is from. He spent many summers there and thus he and my grandpa and uncle swap stories. I\u2019ll be honest I like that. It makes my grandpa happy to be able to talk about people he knew, my grandpa knew many of my boyfriend\u2019s family.\n\nThat is where the happy ends. So after dinner I help clean up a a bit and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m shocked to see my cousin [21F] basically laying on his shoulder while they watch something on his phone. I ask he why she\u2019s like that and she said they were watching something on his phone and she was just leaning over to look. This is the second time something like this has happened. My aunt told me a few months prior that my cousin hung out with my boyfriend. They went to see a movie and then went to get food. My boyfriend told me he was going out but didn\u2019t tell me with who. I assumed it was his friends. \n\nSo seeing them together the other night upset me. My cousin then pulled out her phone and handed it to me it was a chat log with her and my boyfriend. She goes \u201cwe are just friends see for yourself\u201d I scrolled and they seem to text daily..\n\nThat\u2019s when I got very mad and told him to get out and called her a creep. Others heard and came running to the room. To my shock everyone was mad at me saying I was being loud and confrontational. The only ones who seem to be on my side have been my immediate family. My aunt, uncle and others seem to think I am overreacting. With my aunt saying something like her daughter is allowed to have friends. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s been almost a week and I haven\u2019t heard from my boyfriend. He left and hasn\u2019t contacted me since. I feel like maybe I went overboard but idk I do feel a little justified. But was I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701316807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18797wg/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_and_cousin_it_was/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin went on a date with your BF. Seems pretty inappropriate to me.\n\n\nYour aunt, uncle, et al. aren\u2019t on your side because they like your BF and may support your cousin going after him, even with the age difference.", "This is a definition of a dysfunctional family. You dodged a bullet and probably distance yourself from your aunt and uncle.", "NTA. You did the right thing. I\u2019m sorry it sucks but please don\u2019t look back. He was keeping secrets and inappropriate. It would be different if you were aware. This isn\u2019t about having friends this is about being secretive and dishonest. You know who he is now. Do not contact him, keep your power. Have a girls weekend with some friends and start dating.", "NTA and you mean Ex-boyfriend.", "not sure why people are calling you the ah when they\u2019re lacking personal space, hanging out privately and texting daily, this definitely isn\u2019t just \u201c your family bonding with him\u201d", "NTA I had an exSIL do that to my husband and he immediately told me don't leave me alone with her, she keeps hanging on me and trying to put her arms around me or hold my hand. I told my mother and father and they kept an eye on her and if they saw her heading towards my husband they would go rescue him. They would tell her stop that she is married and he is married but she would act like she wasn't doing anything wrong. It sucked for my husband to always be looking over his shoulder when she was around. But my husband didn't hide it from me or just sit there and enjoy it and try to play it down or say I was being crazy. We were all very happy once my brother divorced her for cheating with our sister's husband \ud83d\ude44. She was a walking Jerry Springer show. For him not to say anything says a lot and for her to show you proof they talk is proof she is showing you he likes me better than you... Sucks when there a relatives that can't be happy for you but want what you have instead.", "I was ready to say YTA, but them hanging out together secretly is weird, and should send off alarm bells to any normal person. \n\nNTAH, but if you haven't heard from him in a week, it's probably over. And family gatherings could get a whole lot more tense when he shows up with your cousin at Christmas. \n\nJust allowed to have friends, right?", "NTA, they are cheating obviously. Time to dump him.", "NTA, you didn't overreact at all. If they had a genuine friendship going on he would have let you know out of respect and she should have done the same. The fact that he did it behind your back is not a good sign. Even if nothing is going on between them, it doesn't make them look good. One thing is texting but going out together without your knowledge is a completely different thing.", "Honey, I think you have been ghosted. That dude's not your boyfriend anymore. And probably for the best, since he kept a whole ass \"friendship\" from you.", "NTA\nGetting along well with your cousin at family gatherings is one thing.\n\nBut texting daily and going to the movies together is fucking wierd", "NTA and that cousin would be DEAD TO ME.

If they were talking daily there's more to this than her leaning on him to watch a video. NTA but he's not your bf anymore, so move on and cut your losses.", "NTA. they don't tell you they went to the cinema and they text daily? babe you already know what's going on. end the relationship for good and cut the ties with that cousin. if my cousin did this to me, i'd be too petty to share it with the WHOLE family by the way lol she is old enough to know not to sneak around like this", "NTA , I mean laying over someone shoulder to watch a video I do understand. But the part with the movie date they had ? Wtf ??", "NTA", "ESH. Also, why is your cousin the creep? He\u2019s a grown ass man and she\u2019s barely an adult. That age difference if there is anything sexual happening, it\u2019s him that\u2019s a creep! \n\nI was going to say y t a but it is kinda weird that they are talking so much and being friends without saying anything to you. Your reaction of immediately flipping out over how they were sitting when watching something on a phone seems a little excessive.", "I don't know if you're an asshole but you might be an idiot if you can't untangle what's going on here.", "They\u2019re banging", "NTA. Btw you know he\u2019s cheating on you with her right?", "NTA, that\u2019s just sus. However you could have spoken to him in private instead of breaking up then and there", "I think you should first have talked privately with your BF", "NTA though it could have been handled better. Your husband is a creep. \n\nBefore anyone complains, men and women can absolutely be friends and people can have friends outside of their relationship.  That is a given. But real friendships are not secrets.\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend met your cousin through you? \n\nRegardless he went on a date with her without telling you. He deliberately avoided telling you who he was out with because he knew it would look suspicious. Not only that, but they've been texting EVERY DAY for God knows how long, and neither ever even mentioned it to you. Why wasn't it a group chat together, what did they need to tell each other so secretly that they had to keep it from you? \n\nThe cousin sounds immature, she should gage asked herself why someone else's partner was spending all day messaging her, and whether she wanted to ruin her cousin's relationship like that. But mainly it's his fault for starting this inappropriate \"friendship\" to begin with.\n\nSecret friendships are almost always emotional affairs at minimum - because if there wasn't anything shady going on, it wouldn't BE secret. Add to that the inappropriate touching and I'd be surprised if they arent already dating.\n\nNow, I've never checked a single message on my husband's phone. He has female friends I trust with my life. But you bet I know WHO his friends are, because there are no secrets.\n\nI would ignore your relatives complains. Most people just hate confrontation and would rather condone or ignore people behaving awfully than deal with conflict or make a scene. I dont think they would like it if it happened to them, but they just didnt want to deal with the drama.", "NTA, I would be equally as uncomfortable in your situation. Especially because it sounds like she\u2019s around your guys\u2019 age. \n\nHad she been younger, it totally could\u2019ve been a harmless, \u201chey look at this!\u201d But the fact they message consistently and he hid going on a date with her\u2026 some conversations need to be had. If he respected you he would\u2019ve asked your permission and informed you on where he was.", "ESH - You, a smaller amount, only for being confrontational at a family event, although I can almost understand why you were so upset. But your ex went out on a DATE with your cousin while you were dating him. And did not tell you about it, which makes it very suspicious. And he texts daily with your cousin, which she was happy to show you. If they are just friends, why did he not tell you all this?", "Yep but it doesn't matter now as he's obviously your ex-bf now.", "NTA. Your cousin is a dirty piece of work. Don't intro any more boyfriends to her, because she will probably keep trying to be ' friends' with all of them!! He's better off as an ex!!", "I think you can probably call him you former boyfriend at this point. \n\nIMO, YTA, but I\u2019m not a jealous person so I may be in the minority.", "YTA so now he can\u2019t even be friends with your cousin? You said he was close with your family. You kicked him out and expect him to come crawling back?", "YTA. I get it was suspicious to you all things considered Instead of going full confrontational during the holiday you probs should\u2019ve had a calm conversation with your boyfriend beforehand about boundaries with his friendship with your cousin. Instead you made the holiday awkward and your boyfriend seems to have broken up with you.", "YTA and single too", "It cost you a boyfriend, so the \"Am I an asshole\" question can be answered easily.\n\nYes, yes you were and now you have the repercussions.", "Jeez. You're jealous of your young cousin, while claiming that you love how happy your boyfriend is being around your family? Get a grip. woman.\n\nYTA.", "Your cousin is dating your boyfriend. NTA", "Texting daily and withholding than info from you is red flag material. Even if nothing sketchy has happened, if one is innocent, they do not conceal everyday communication with somebody. It's weird. It's suspicious. I hope he's your ex by now", "NTA, you reacted poorly absolutely. \nBut they are hanging out and texting behind your back? That\u2019s gross. \nA movie and food? Sounds like a date. \nIn the cousins defence, she showed you the text as if you knew. \nSeems like your boyfriend is being sly af.", ">Anyway it\u2019s been almost a week and I haven\u2019t heard from my boyfriend.\n\nYTA. I find this whole story rather odd. Not content to break it up, you have to call your cousin a creep?", "YTA. \n\nYou showed him who you are my kicking him out of the Thanksgiving celebration and shaming him for being friendly and blaming him for what she was doing that upset you. \n\nHe deserves better. \n\nIt's good that you helped him realize that early on in the relationship so that he didn't continue to waste his time with someone as in secure and inconsiderate as you. \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t secret, he didn\u2019t lie, and adults can have friends. Her leaning over his shoulder is normal human interaction, so only you can decide if it was sexual or not. Given that she handed you her phone, they aren\u2019t doing anything illicit and the people calling it a date have no idea that men and women can just be friends.\n\nIf I was your boyfriend, you\u2019d be my ex right now. You handled it like a child, there\u2019s no instance where I\u2019m staying with someone who kicked me out of a family dinner.\n\nYou also conveniently left out your own age.", "You dodged a BULLET! Make sure he is your ex-BF and I would stay far away from your cousin, after all, the next holiday is for Ho, Ho, Ho\u2019s.", "Yeah, he might be too chummy with your cousin but you for sure were a drama queen and an asshole in that situation.", "Yeah YTA.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA for calling your cousin a creep. Your ex was the creep here, lmao. Ick!", "I would say NTA, but not so smart either. Your cousin is 21, it seems she has a crush and hang on him. You should have sit her down and explain that you know about her feelings and it makes you uncomfortable that they are out behind your back. I think she would be on your side. You called her a creep and that\u2019s unfair. She was even willing to proof that it\u2019s platonic.\nYour bf on the other side. Why wasn\u2019t you mad at him? For whatever reason he went behind your back (there is a small option that he likes the attention by her but that was it). He should be called creepy. That he doesn\u2019t want to clarify is even more suspicious. Try to make an end with him.
