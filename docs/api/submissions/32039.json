I brought my boyfriend [33M] of 3 years. This was the second time I bring him to a family event. He came last year for Christmas as well. He gets along fine with my family. He especially gets along well with my grandpa and my uncle as his family is from the same small town that my family is from. He spent many summers there and thus he and my grandpa and uncle swap stories. I\u2019ll be honest I like that. It makes my grandpa happy to be able to talk about people he knew, my grandpa knew many of my boyfriend\u2019s family.\n\nThat is where the happy ends. So after dinner I help clean up a a bit and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m shocked to see my cousin [21F] basically laying on his shoulder while they watch something on his phone. I ask he why she\u2019s like that and she said they were watching something on his phone and she was just leaning over to look. This is the second time something like this has happened. My aunt told me a few months prior that my cousin hung out with my boyfriend. They went to see a movie and then went to get food. My boyfriend told me he was going out but didn\u2019t tell me with who. I assumed it was his friends. \n\nSo seeing them together the other night upset me. My cousin then pulled out her phone and handed it to me it was a chat log with her and my boyfriend. She goes \u201cwe are just friends see for yourself\u201d I scrolled and they seem to text daily..\n\nThat\u2019s when I got very mad and told him to get out and called her a creep. Others heard and came running to the room. To my shock everyone was mad at me saying I was being loud and confrontational. The only ones who seem to be on my side have been my immediate family. My aunt, uncle and others seem to think I am overreacting. With my aunt saying something like her daughter is allowed to have friends. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s been almost a week and I haven\u2019t heard from my boyfriend. He left and hasn\u2019t contacted me since. I feel like maybe I went overboard but idk I do feel a little justified. But was I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701316807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18797wg/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_and_cousin_it_was/", "score": 248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was keeping secrets and inappropriate. It would be different if you were aware. This isn\u2019t about having friends this is about being secretive and dishonest. You know who he is now.

I told my mother and father and they kept an eye on her and if they saw her heading towards my husband they would go rescue him. They would tell her stop that she is married and he is married but she would act like she wasn't doing anything wrong. It sucked for my husband to always be looking over his shoulder when she was around. But my husband didn't hide it from me or just sit there and enjoy it and try to play it down or say I was being crazy. We were all very happy once my brother divorced her for cheating with our sister's husband \ud83d\ude44. She was a walking Jerry Springer show.

Time to dump him.", "NTA, you didn't overreact at all. If they had a genuine friendship going on he would have let you know out of respect and she should have done the same.

Your husband is a creep. \n\nBefore anyone complains, men and women can absolutely be friends and people can have friends outside of their relationship.  That is a given. But real friendships are not secrets.\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend met your cousin through you? \n\nRegardless he went on a date with her without telling you. He deliberately avoided telling you who he was out with because he knew it would look suspicious. Not only that, but they've been texting EVERY DAY for God knows how long, and neither ever even mentioned it to you. Why wasn't it a group chat together, what did they need to tell each other so secretly that they had to keep it from you? \n\nThe cousin sounds immature, she should gage asked herself why someone else's partner was spending all day messaging her, and whether she wanted to ruin her cousin's relationship like that. But mainly it's his fault for starting this inappropriate \"friendship\" to begin with.\n\nSecret friendships are almost always emotional affairs at minimum - because if there wasn't anything shady going on, it wouldn't BE secret. Add to that the inappropriate touching and I'd be surprised if they arent already dating.\n\nNow, I've never checked a single message on my husband's phone. He has female friends I trust with my life. But you bet I know WHO his friends are, because there are no secrets.\n\nI would ignore your relatives complains.

You said he was close with your family. You kicked him out and expect him to come crawling back?", "YTA. I get it was suspicious to you all things considered Instead of going full confrontational during the holiday you probs should\u2019ve had a calm conversation with your boyfriend beforehand about boundaries with his friendship with your cousin. Instead you made the holiday awkward and your boyfriend seems to have broken up with you.", "YTA and single too", "It cost you a boyfriend, so the \"Am I an asshole\" question can be answered easily.\n\nYes, yes you were and now you have the repercussions.", "Jeez.

Your ex was the creep here, lmao. Ick!", "I would say NTA, but not so smart either. Your cousin is 21, it seems she has a crush and hang on him. You should have sit her down and explain that you know about her feelings and it makes you uncomfortable that they are out behind your back. I think she would be on your side. You called her a creep and that\u2019s unfair. She was even willing to proof that it\u2019s platonic.\nYour bf on the other side. Why wasn\u2019t you mad at him? For whatever reason he went behind your back (there is a small option that he likes the attention by her but that was it). He should be called creepy.

And if I texted regularly, I'd probably text with them everyday too. I think one of them cut me out because their new partner got jealous, and ngl it hurt pretty bad.\n\nBut then again, it seems like there're a lot of hidden aholes. So maybe you were right. Either way, you're boyfriend is probably your ex now.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\n\"Anyway, it\u2019s been almost a week, and I haven\u2019t heard from my boyfriend. He left and hasn\u2019t contacted me since.\" \n\nGood for him.  What did you think was going to happen?  You told him to get out.\n\nDid you think he was going to come groveling and begging for forgiveness?\n\nIf he has any sense, you will NEVER hear from him again.", "YTA. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong method.", "I\u2019m really sorry that happened to you. My opinion, your cousin and your boyfriend\u2019s friendship is very unusual. I would be highly upset that they went out together and didn\u2019t include you that they text all the time and don\u2019t include you. It\u2019s really shady on both their parts. \nYou need to have a conversation with your boyfriend, and have a conversation with your cousin and see where things go. \n\nMore than anything I would trust your gut. I believe you know the answer to your question or already.", "NTA\n\nThey went out on a date, text daily and her family is okay with it.\n\nHoney, OP, the writing is on the wall if you want to find your (ex) boyfriend just go hang out at your cousins house.", "NTA - They texted behind your back DAILY and went out on what I imagine is a date without you knowing? Yeah, there was something there lol. \n\nIf they truly were just 'friends' it could have been great! But they would have told you and talked about it.", "NTA but your boyfriend is definitely seeing your cousin. Dump him.", "Honestly, any boyfriend worth having wouldn't need to be told not to let another woman lay on him.\n\nIt's a *good* thing you haven't heard from your boyfriend. He's a bad partner and you don't need that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just make sure that when he shows up at the next family holiday as her boyfriend, you exclusively refer to him as \u201cmy ex.\u201d \n\n\u201cCousin, could you have my ex-boyfriend pass the potatoes please?\u201d", "I used to look into my male friend's phones (and vice versa) when we return home on the train after work, and share memes or videos. There's no need to lay on his shoulder at all \ud83e\udd23 \n\nWhat nonsense. \n\n\nNTA. Forget your Ex. He's not worth it.", "nta but i don\u2019t think he\u2019s your boyfriend anymore. neither of them are children, they both betrayed you here. i think it\u2019s pretty clear the nature of their relationship was inappropriate if it wasn\u2019t already sexual. i\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this and especially sorry your family seems to be picking the wrong side.", "honestly no one should be that close \ud83d\ude2f. so he hasn't contacted you in a week? he's with her", "leaning on his shoulder would have been meh if they didn't hang out behind ur back. he is sus and she is sus-er. girl was probably getting all hearty eyes and shit sitting near a man.\nand the fact that he didn't care to explain makes him the AH.i wonder if he is still texting her tho. \nso unless he explains , dumb his ass( i don't think he deserves u).", "NTA your boyfriend and cousin are hooking up. This is not about you, this is about them being incredibly weird and shitty.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019ve obviously been up to something behind your back, they had at least one secret date together. ATP, block him and her, and consider this relationship done. And avoid family reunions for a while, the cheater will probably attend as her new boo.", "Overboard? I think not. NTA. This is way too much to be going on without you being aware. Quite shady.", "I can't believe he dumped you for your cousin. He was with you for 3 years. Just wow. I hope you have a good support system, you're going to need it. She's with him and will probably be bringing him around too. NTA Good luck.", "Sounds like he\u2019s after your cousin", "NTA. But He\u2019s hasn\u2019t reached out because he\u2019s not that into you. If he had upset you and they were truly just friends he\u2019d be trying to defend that and make you feel better or agree to stop hanging out with her. She way too comfy with him. I would be wary you may see him at the next family event but not there with you\u2026.", "Oh that\u2019s freaky.", "NTA - Your boyfriend and cousin were dating behind your back. What's not to be angry about? I would explode too . . .", "Yta and he dumped you for sexualizing his relationship with his cousin", "NTA. This is weird AF and a major red flag.", "Mmm. Normally I'm really against people jumping to conclusions about people being more than friends, but like...\n\nIf someone is good friends with a family member, that's usually pretty out in the open and talked about openly. Them going out together isn't really the problem by itself, but it's very weird he wouldn't tell you that it was her he was going to hang out with. I can't imagine doing that without there being some sort of unusual context. Same with them talking daily, by itself that's fine but like, it's pretty normal for a partner to know who their partner is talking to a lot and there's no reason for them not to because it should come up naturally in conversation. The only way it wouldn't, again, is if there's some sort of unusual context. So yeah. NTA *except*!\n\nYou should be more upset with your boyfriend than her. I'm still going with NTA but remember your boyfriend is your boyfriend and he's perfectly capable of controlling himself and behaving appropriately if he wanted to. He's chosen not to, and for all we know he was encouraging her and telling her you were fine with it or something.", "Nah that's just her cousin's new boyfriend.", "Yeah... OP, if they're hiding hanging out and talking every day, it's likely they're having an affair, if only an emotional one at this point. I'd consider the relationship over, OR have a serious talk with him and figure out what's going on... although I think we all know.", "Future get-togethers are gonna suck for OP when her cousin shows up with her ex.", "I have my cousins boyfriend\u2019s number, but they\u2019ve been together over a decade and I think I\u2019ve only texted him like twice about sports. \n\nNTA.
