She has a 2 month old and doesn't realise what it's like to parent kids that are toddlers like yours and the other couples are.\n\nShe also sounds like she is a master manipulator and a bit of a gaslighter.  Has she always been like this?  Or has she changed since she had her baby?  If she's changed there may be an element of mental health dysfunction which probably needs some help but telling her might make things worse (but might be worth talking to Doug - or getting your partner to do it - and finding out what it's really like at home as Doug is in a much better position to get Cathy some help).\n\nYour other option is to go to this get away and show Cathy and Doug what it's really like with kids.  So there may be a need to stop a couple of times before you get to your destination - and if you are travelling in a convoy then perhaps everyone needs to stop at the same time - could be quite a few times with 3 cars!\n\nThen make sure they are early dinners (because that's what toddlers like) and then be back in your rooms by 7pm for kids bedtimes.  Let the kids be kids at the places you eat out at and preferably kid friendly so a family restaurant rather than higher end eating places.\n\nThe zoo will be fun chasing the twins... and your daughter will actually enjoy it even if she is really young.\n\nCathy's well thought out plans that suit her family will be thrown into disarray when you and the other couple need to change them to meet your family's needs.", "Having the children involved is a major sticking point for Cathy. They have issues with child care and she wants all of our kids to be friends (even though in my experience I always disliked my parents friend's kids that were my age. But that is probably a me issue)", "This idea has been floated out there.  My wife and Cathy were on maternity leave at the same time, my wife made multiple attempts to get together with Cathy and go on walks ect. Cathy would always change the plans to something that suited her perfectly and would interfere with my kids schedule completely.", "This is exactly what I was thinking - an easy, child friendly place to hang out (in town) would be a good compromise. You could even bring a picnic, or do a bbq at the park.", "Cathy and Doug are the type of couple that rarely go out without the other, they are both kind of anxious. Cathy likely has postpartum issues and has voiced that she feels guilty going out and having a good time without her kid. The other couple are constantly handing off childcare duties to each other so we can occasionally have some semblance of our old lives.", "I think you hit the nail on the head. Thanks", "There's enough history there, that outcome is a ways off", "I think, maybe, you misunderstand. I have no issues with her wanting to involve her kids on things, once other friends started having kids, when we had get togethers their kids were always welcome and adjustments to a more family friendly environment were made. Before I had a kid, it wasn't an issue to shuffle plans, but it is annoying to always have one couple changing plans and forcing the others to meet their needs. Seldom is there a time where a compromise is met where all sides make adjustments. And as far as my criticisms go, those are not hypothetical, they are incidents that the other couple, my wife, and I have all discussed with bewilderment. While dealing with friends it's possible to be annoyed by them at times and still be friends. The examples above represent a very small portion of time spent together.\n\nAlso you are assuming that my wife and I haven't also faced struggles, which is incorrect.", "We do have yards, but it seems like regardless of who is offering to host, Cathy needs to change or make things more complicated than needed. For example when I offered to grill out she asked if I could grill and transplant the food to their house. She does this to the other couple as well. And when they offer to host the events are overly extravagant or they are super up tight about kids being kids despite them making no effort to baby proof (like wanting to sit in their upstairs living room but not having a baby gate at the top of the stairs, and refusing to move the one they have. Or keeping sentimental items where toddlers can get to them.)", "Understandable. When I was a toddler there were several families that my parents did stuff with and I would hang out with the other toddlers my age. To what I recall (from word of mouth and from photo albums, since I can't remember that time) we stayed local, went to each other's houses or had picnics at the park. \n\nTraveling long distances with a young one can be so taxing. Especially when you have to stay overnight somewhere. It sounds like a whole lot of stress and work and no fun to me!", "Let\u2019s keep this simple. Kathy has anxiety and there\u2019s always a problem. But you need to connect with your friends. So if you want to grill at your place? Invite both couples over. With kids. And if Kathy wants to seize control? Don\u2019t let her. Let them know that they are invited at one if they can make it. And you\u2019re going to be doing kebabs or what the hell ever. If they want to bring something it could be wine or something sweet. And if they can\u2019t make it you hope to see them next time. That\u2019s it. If Kathy can\u2019t handle any of that? You could at least stay cool with the other friends.

Having kids doesn\u2019t mean not maintaining friends. Organising picnics, park meet ups etc is a great way to stay connected with other friends with kids.\n\nNTA though for not wanting to do a trip away.", "I think the problem is that Cathy has no family support system and has no way to get time off from being a mother. Finding reliable, trustable childcare for a 9-month-old baby is probably really hard for her. And if Doug isn't doing his share as a father, that would make it even harder. It's looking rather likely that's the case, given Cathy's desperation -- note that she's not proposing women-only events with the children left with their fathers. \n\nChildfree events aren't a possibility for her. That's why she wants to do family things rather than couple things. It's the only way she'll get to go out.", "I wish I could upvote this more. NTA of course, for not wanted to drag a bunch of kids on a road trip, but my heart hurts for Cathy. She sounds very isolated. It\u2019s so hard without a support network. Maybe she isn\u2019t going about it the best way, but she\u2019s probably a bit overwhelmed at the moment. Maybe OP and his wife can make some time to include her somehow in a way that works for both families.", "Then she needs to hold off organizing events till she is able to find a babysitter instead of being passive aggressive to her friends. Or, in the alternative, she needs to be honest and say that she needs a break and ask for help.", "Agreed, she and her husband need to step up and give each other a night off here and there.", "NTA Cathy needs to respect when someone tells her no. Right now she hears \u201cno\u201d and thinks it\u2019s her place to make you justify yourself. I get that not everyone has a support system \u2014 it\u2019s something to consider when deciding to have kids. That is, a support system that isn\u2019t built on guilt. She and her spouse need to sort this out with a willing party because there will be times where they\u2019ll need a trusted person to watch their child.\n\nChildren often change their parents\u2019 friend relationships. Things get so busy when the children are so young. That\u2019s just how it goes. I get that she probably misses how things used to be, but her approach isn\u2019t the right way to go.", "NAH. Cathy is in a tough spot and she just wants to maintain relationships with you. You\u2019ve all got your own lives and going from spending time together for trips to barely spending any time together is difficult, especially if you lack other support networks and thought during pregnancy that your friends, who you travelled with and who now have their own families, would be there. It\u2019s no ones fault that you\u2019re all in different situations but I do think you collectively need to either be clear with Cathy that things just aren\u2019t going to be how she\u2019d like and therefore you probably won\u2019t see her much until the kids are older OR you need to find a way to get together that meets everyone\u2019s needs. Others have suggested afternoon things like BBQs or something. There are so many options.", "Cathy sounds high maintenance, which can be difficult when you have kids.  I think you have to wait it out until she has been worn down by the realities of being a parent, and understands better where you are coming from.", "NTA, socializing with such small children is hard. Luckily my friends and I are all in the same stage.

Backyard get together", "Time to figure out some low cost baby friendly options.  Go for a picnic at a park that has a playground!  Maybe a day together at a pool!  Backyard BBQ!  All these things are good for kids and babies.  I think Cathy is desperate for some socializing.  Maybe take turns doing a girl's night out one week and a guy's night out the next week so everyone has a chance to go out and do childcare.", "That sounds like a much better plan", "ESH\n\nNone of you actually sound like you are real friends. You certainly treat each other more like casual acquaintances. And you're as closed minded as Cathy is.\n\nWhy can't you and your friends go out for a restaurant meal with a baby and toddlers? Of course you can! Sure, youngsters in a restuarant can be a bit hectic to manage but you don't have to go every week. Pick the right restaurant and you can all see each other and have a laugh. Stop being so closed minded and be a little more flexible. Kids aren't young forever - you can get through this and stay friends. If you can be bothered, that is.", "Nta. Do get together for some childless events tho once in a while", "NAH. Cathy misses her friends and is hurt you don't feel the same way about her as she feels about the rest of you.

When I look at your comments and descriptions, what comes across more than anything, in spite of any potential mental health things like anxiety or PPD, is that Cathy is self-centred. Things need to be her way and her way only. You and your other friends need to stop enabling her. Rather than giving her a veto, you need to start setting the boundary that this is how things are and if she isn\u2019t keen, she doesn\u2019t have to attend. But letting her stomp all over you all the time isn\u2019t helping things. Communication needs to be significantly improved.", "I agree with you, but I also think it may be Cathy\u2019s not understanding that taking a infant that basically eats, sleeps and poops is different from managing older children who are getting more mobile, inquisitive, attention-seeking, and vocal.", "My take is Cathy has no family to help, so she\u2019s looking for her friend group to bond with her child so they can be potential future babysitters. She wants to turn her friends into her child\u2019s \u2018village\u2019, future \u2018aunts and uncles\u2019.", "yeah, doing a trip doesn't make a lot of sense. \n\nbut- like others have said- you guys could definitely do get togethers at each others homes or a park or a play space. Basically someplace where if its nap time for a child, they can be put in a spot to rest, while other kids continue to play and the adults get to chat.\n\nand i agree just because the adults are friends doesn't mean that the kids will be but right now they are little. getting together is more about adult time. when the kids get older, there will be plenty of time to make sure that your child(ren) know that they don't have to be friends if they don't want to be.", "It's not a you issue, my father became friends with the parents of my literal bullies so  you can imagine how fun multi family vacations got for me. I imagine you'll know better than our parents tho.", "Can you explain what you mean when you say she has problems with childcare? That doesn't really make sense to me. I get that she doesn't have family to babysit, but there are many non-family childcare options. She needs to utilize this options if her family isn't helping. Why is she not able to hire someone? Is she a bad boss and no one wants to work for her? Is she needing support for postpartum mental health issues? I think the wives in the friend group need to have a no-kids girls day so they can ask questions and help her find the help she needs. I think there are a few different possible explanations for all of this, but they pretty much all have the same fix: a therapist. Maybe she has PP issues. Maybe she just can't adjust to the transition to parent friendships. Maybe she's not getting the coparenting support she needs and has to build up a spine. Maybe she's struggling with her loss of family and trying to build a new one. Who knows! But... if she can't even find someone willing to babysit for cash for a few hours, it does strongly suggest she needs help one way or the other.", "That's a you issue.

Wow how entitled, shouldn't have had kids if you can't take care of them.\n\nI really don't think this woman is so unreasonable for trying to figure out kid-friendly options for meeting up as a group. Tons of people do it.\n\nIt's wrong of her to be passive aggressive, but I hope that when my friends and I have kids they're more empathetic towards me if I'm struggling.\n\nBring on the downvotes.", "This seems kind of cynical. It seems to me like Cathy is really struggling because of her lack of support and is desperately trying to organise seeing her friends in a child-friendly way because that is literally the only way she's able to see anyone. She's going about it the wrong way but I feel sad for her that none of her friends have the empathy to see that the newest mom in their group is struggling and won't make an effort to figure out a group activity that everyone can attend. \n\nThis comments section is depressing. Everyone is all about mental health and supporting women until an actual woman is obviously struggling, at which point *obviously* she's malingering for babysitting and needs to 'take a break organising things until she gets a babysitter.'", "It's pretty common to have play dates with friends. The kids aren't old enough to make their own friends & play with friends of their parents while the parents get to see each other.", "Except - as OP says in other comments - his wife has tried to organize other kid friendly events (such as park picnics, etc) and the woman in question keeps turning them down in favor of big plans that don\u2019t work.
