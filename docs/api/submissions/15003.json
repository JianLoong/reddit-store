It seems more than understandable to me that she is overflowing with emotions. I think it would be smart to think of this situation as maybe you and your partner don't need your friends to get through life, but maybe Cathy does need you and that's why she's so frustrated that you turn down all her invitations.", "Nta.\n\nPerhaps it's time to drop Kathy and doug", "NTA it\u2019s just not practical with kids that age.\n\nNot only won\u2019t they get any imitate enjoyment out of most activities that any of the adults would enjoy, they also wouldn\u2019t remember it.\n\nAt those ages the difference in needs, schedule and development is Huge.

Kathy is struggling. Which is not anyone\u2019s fault. But it seems like she wants to have an exciting jazzy life. That most people with tiny children understand needs to be paused. NTA. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if you guys have backyards or space to host one another for picnic lunches or barbecues or anything low-key and friendly where the kids can be kids and you guys can get together for a couple of hours. I don\u2019t know where you live it may not be possible. But think about it. Because it\u2019s so easy to get isolated in your silos when you have little ones.

Especially since you guys used to go out every once in a while. But that doesn't mean she should try and guilt trip you and say things like \"i won't plan things in the future\". \n\nIt is hard to be rejected sometimes. \n\nAnd It's even harder raising children.", "Cathy is in for some lessons as her child gets a little older.  She has a 2 month old and doesn't realise what it's like to parent kids that are toddlers like yours and the other couples are.\n\nShe also sounds like she is a master manipulator and a bit of a gaslighter.  Has she always been like this?  Or has she changed since she had her baby?  If she's changed there may be an element of mental health dysfunction which probably needs some help but telling her might make things worse (but might be worth talking to Doug - or getting your partner to do it - and finding out what it's really like at home as Doug is in a much better position to get Cathy some help).\n\nYour other option is to go to this get away and show Cathy and Doug what it's really like with kids.  So there may be a need to stop a couple of times before you get to your destination - and if you are travelling in a convoy then perhaps everyone needs to stop at the same time - could be quite a few times with 3 cars!\n\nThen make sure they are early dinners (because that's what toddlers like) and then be back in your rooms by 7pm for kids bedtimes.  Let the kids be kids at the places you eat out at and preferably kid friendly so a family restaurant rather than higher end eating places.\n\nThe zoo will be fun chasing the twins... and your daughter will actually enjoy it even if she is really young.\n\nCathy's well thought out plans that suit her family will be thrown into disarray when you and the other couple need to change them to meet your family's needs.", "Having the children involved is a major sticking point for Cathy. They have issues with child care and she wants all of our kids to be friends (even though in my experience I always disliked my parents friend's kids that were my age. But that is probably a me issue)", "This idea has been floated out there.  My wife and Cathy were on maternity leave at the same time, my wife made multiple attempts to get together with Cathy and go on walks ect. Cathy would always change the plans to something that suited her perfectly and would interfere with my kids schedule completely.", "This is exactly what I was thinking - an easy, child friendly place to hang out (in town) would be a good compromise. You could even bring a picnic, or do a bbq at the park.", "Cathy and Doug are the type of couple that rarely go out without the other, they are both kind of anxious. Cathy likely has postpartum issues and has voiced that she feels guilty going out and having a good time without her kid. The other couple are constantly handing off childcare duties to each other so we can occasionally have some semblance of our old lives.", "I think you hit the nail on the head. Thanks", "There's enough history there, that outcome is a ways off", "I think, maybe, you misunderstand. I have no issues with her wanting to involve her kids on things, once other friends started having kids, when we had get togethers their kids were always welcome and adjustments to a more family friendly environment were made. Before I had a kid, it wasn't an issue to shuffle plans, but it is annoying to always have one couple changing plans and forcing the others to meet there needs. Seldom is there a time where a compromise is met where all sides make adjustments. And as far as my criticisms go, those are not hypothetical, they are incidents that the other couple, my wife, and I have all discussed with bewilderment. While dealing with friends it's possible to be annoyed by them at times and still be friends. The examples above represent a very small portion of time spent together.\n\nAlso you are assuming that my wife and I haven't also faced struggles, which is incorrect.", "We do have yards, but it seems like regardless of who is offering to host, Cathy needs to change or make things more complicated than needed. For example when I offered to grill out she asked if I could grill and transplant the food to their house. She does this to the other couple as well. And when they offer to host the events are overly extravagant or they are super up tight about kids being kids despite them making no effort to baby proof (like wanting to sit in their upstairs living room but not having a baby gate at the top of the stairs, and refusing to move the one they have. Or keeping sentimental items where toddlers can get to them.)", "Understandable. When I was a toddler there were several families that my parents did stuff with and I would hang out with the other toddlers my age. To what I recall (from word of mouth and from photo albums, since I can't remember that time) we stayed local, went to each other's houses or had picnics at the park. \n\nTraveling long distances with a young one can be so taxing. Especially when you have to stay overnight somewhere. It sounds like a whole lot of stress and work and no fun to me!", "Let\u2019s keep this simple. Kathy has anxiety and there\u2019s always a problem. But you need to connect with your friends. So if you want to grill at your place? Invite both couples over. With kids. And if Kathy wants to seize control? Don\u2019t let her. Let them know that they are invited at one if they can make it. And you\u2019re going to be doing kebabs or what the hell ever. If they want to bring something it could be wine or something sweet. And if they can\u2019t make it you hope to see them next time. That\u2019s it. If Kathy can\u2019t handle any of that? You could at least stay cool with the other friends. She\u2019s got stuff to work out.", "NTA driving three hours with an infant sounds like one of the versions of hell in the Good Place", "Invite them round for a braai or bbq with a few fun activities for the littles splash pool etc.  Make an effort,  she clearly feels a lack of friendship on your side.  Do b that and ywnbta. Keep pushing them away and you'll run the friendship", "Indeed, why not go to the park for a picknick.", "Agree with this comment! Having kids doesn\u2019t mean not maintaining friends. Organising picnics, park meet ups etc is a great way to stay connected with other friends with kids.\n\nNTA though for not wanting to do a trip away.", "I think the problem is that Cathy has no family support system and has no way to get time off from being a mother. Finding reliable, trustable childcare for a 9-month-old baby is probably really hard for her. And if Doug isn't doing his share as a father, that would make it even harder. It's looking rather likely that's the case, given Cathy's desperation -- note that she's not proposing women-only events with the children left with their fathers. \n\nChildfree events aren't a possibility for her. That's why she wants to do family things rather than couple things. It's the only way she'll get to go out.", "I wish I could upvote this more. NTA of course, for not wanted to drag a bunch of kids on a road trip, but my heart hurts for Cathy. She sounds very isolated. It\u2019s so hard without a support network. Maybe she isn\u2019t going about it the best way, but she\u2019s probably a bit overwhelmed at the moment. Maybe OP and his wife can make some time to include her somehow in a way that works for both families.", "Then she needs to hold off organizing events till she is able to find a babysitter instead of being passive aggressive to her friends. Or, in the alternative, she needs to be honest and say that she needs a break and ask for help.", "Agreed, she and her husband need to step up and give each other a night off here and there."]}
