His hair is matted very easily, even with brushing, as he is a working dog and the weather in England is not the greatest. He\u2019s only 1 and a half and this is his 3rd time at the groomers. The place I took him to is new as I have recently moved.\n\nI enquired over the phone about a groom and they asked for pictures. I told them over the phone he is quite matted, to which the response was no problem. They received the pictures and quoted \u00a355-\u00a360 for a full groom. A little more than I\u2019ve paid before but completely fine with me and I book him in.\n\nThe day rolls around and I drop him off and once again remind them he is matted. Again, no problem.\n\nI get a call little while later saying he is nearly ready for pickup. She also mentions on the phone they only accept cash so I will need to get some on the way. To double check, I ask the price and am told \u00a375. I was slightly confused why this was the case as I was quoted \u00a355-\u00a360. I didn\u2019t say anything then but waited until I got to the place.\n\nWhen I get there they tell me there is an extra \u00a315 fee for dematting the dog. They shaved him all the way back using their shortest blade they have so I\u2019m not quite understanding what they have dematted.\n\nThe woman was very rude, asking me questions like \u201cdo you even brush your dog?\u201d. I explained of course I do and would of expected a call informing and asking me about any change in the price before any service was carried out, to which she ignored. She also pulled out a piece of paper with prices on. These prices were slightly less than the full groom I was quoted but I expected my quote to be more as he is a very hairy dog. She then points to a dematting charge in the corner that starts at \u00a35 but she was charging me \u00a315. \n\nThese prices weren't shown to me before I took the dog or even when I dropped him off, even after reminding them again he was matted. They also don't have a website so no official price list available online to see.\n\nIn the end I only gave her \u00a360 as quoted by herself and left. My only reasoning behind this is you don\u2019t take something like your car into a garage and get quoted a price for repairs, only to show up to collect your vehicle and extra work has been carried out and they are asking for more. You would expect a call first informing you of any change and permission to go ahead. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit:\nJust want to clarify for those that are saying my dog isn\u2019t brushed properly because he is matted - he is a working sheep dog. Look up and see how hairy bearded collies get, and then compound that with mud and water for months. He can only be brushed for so long before needing taking to the groomers for a shave, it\u2019s something that has to be done. The matting is unavoidable for the breed, especially as he is a working dog. It\u2019s not like his coat is completely matted, he gets patches over time which eventually can\u2019t be brushed out and need shaving.", "created_utc": 1667585615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym63ay/aita_for_not_paying_full_price_to_the_dog_groomer/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dog took longer than expected and was in worse condition than they expected, you\u2019re paying for their labour, they\u2019re not going to call you an hour into grooming to ask permission to FINISH the job because it took longer than expected, they\u2019re just going to finish it. Don\u2019t go back if you\u2019re not satisfied, but also, don\u2019t rip off people who have already done labour for you.", "NTA. You sent pictures! I hate when places do this and I wish more people stood up to them about it.", "NTA. They said 55-60 so 60 is what they got.  \n\n\nBut how can a collie have a beard when it\u00b4s completely covered with fur as most dogs are?", "Eh, I have to say NTA, if nothing else because they gave you an estimate that the groomer didn't amend when you dropped the dog off. That way they confirmed the pricing.  Also, showing you a pricelist to justify the additional charges and then having those written surcharges be different from the price difference is not a good look.\n\nStill, take better care of the puppy, if I may add.", "NTA.", "YTA. Go over to r/doggrooming, post the pictures of your dog before and the situation. I feel like you they would be able to describe what happened from more of a business/professional standpoint. Obviously the groomers quoted you \u00a35-\u00a310 more via the pictures but what was the time period between then and the grooming? How long did the session take?", "Nta, you weren't told about the price change", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfyi, if he's matted you definitely don't brush your dog all the way. Having to shave the dog down means there is pretty bad matting right near the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately a quote is not the amount you are to pay for everything, it is the expected cost for services based on the regular service. Your groomers needed to do more work because your matting was most likely a lot worse than you descirbed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should groom your dog better, but they should also contact you about it being more work so more money. If thats done and you don't want to pay more it's likely you will be refused the groom. However it gets rid of extra work for them or potential unexpected costs for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~Signed, a show dog owner with a really a hairy dog that hates brushing.", "NTA.  They were trying to scam you.", "ESH\n\nThey should've called you and explained the price change before continuing with services\n\nYou need to brush your dog better.", "YTA even if they shave him it takes longer with a matted dog. They probably added this on because it does take more time. You need to take better care of your dog by brushing him more often and taking him to the groomers more frequently.", "YTA for neglecting your dog so much he had to be shaved. Mats are painful and limit mobility", "ESH - Them because they should have quoted $75 if you were forthcoming and told them the dog was matted. You for neglecting your dog. You need to take even more time home grooming, every day, for a dog that works like that. I understand you try, but you need to try harder.", "NTA. Places must enclose if they are going to add more to a charge before they get it. In fact they didn\u2019t even get your consent to even shave your dog!", "The OP sent them pics of the dog before they took them in. They also told them that the dog was matted so they should have mentioned the price then and if the pics weren't good enough for them to get an idea on how bad it was, then they should have told OP to bring the dog in for an actual quote.", "Saying this again: A picture does not show how matted a dog is.\r  \n\r  \nPetting a dog doesn't even show you how matted it is if its by the skin.\r  \n\r\r  \nGroomers do not assume matted equals really bad matting. They expect it to be a few mats here and there because yuou missed spots, not for it to be something that shaving is needed for automatically", "Yep. ESH except the pup. \nThe groomer could've explained the extra cost when pup was dropped off after a cursory exam. \nThe owner should take care of their dog appropriately for the poor pup's needs. Matting can be so painful for dogs.", "Agree, or else take your dog in more frequently and keep him in a shorter cut if you can\u2019t maintain his coat. Matting hurts dogs and pulls on their skin.", "A picture does not show how matted a dog is.\n\nPetting a dog doesn't even show you how matted it is if its by the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGroomers do not assume matted equals really bad matting. They expect it to be a few mats here and there because yuou missed spots, not for it to be something that shaving is needed for automatically.", "Yup. Just look over on r/doggrooming on what people have to deal with there. A severely matted dog is not only painful for the dog, but it can take a groomer several hours to work on to get the dog shaved and their time is money! Plus, you don\u2019t want someone rushing to shave your dog when they\u2019re badly matted. This can cause your dog to bleed and be even more painful. I have a lot of respect for dog groomers cause they get a lot of crap from people who don\u2019t brush their dog or take them in regularly and get angry when they have to get a shave down.", "In addition to sending the pictures, OP told them the dog was \"quite matted.\" The groomer had that information when they gave the quote and didn't mention a possible fee. The groomer could have said \"if the matting is especially bad there will be an extra \u00a315 de-matting fee\" or could have just included the possible fee in the quote range and said \u00a355-75 instead of \u00a355-60.", "\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be around 60\u201d\nThey actually see dog. Call OP before doing anything\n\u201cSo the matting on your dog is really bad and it\u2019ll cost an extra 15, would you still like to go through with this?\u201d\nThen once OP agrees they can proceed. A simple phone call isn\u2019t that difficult lol"]}
