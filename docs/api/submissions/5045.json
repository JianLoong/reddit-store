We do not have a close relationship, in fact, I dont even know his age, although I know he's +30. He'd spend most of the day at his room playing fortnite, so we didn't really talk to each other. \n\nThe problem is that he has this long cable that goes from his room to my grandmother's room, which he uses to have a better internet connection. I did tell him at the time that he didn't need it to play, and to not use it while he was at our house, but he did It anyway and told me to watch over my dog (I don't do it 24/7, I have classes and stuff, but there's always someone else at home to watch her)\n\nWell, eventually the dog bit the cable while I was at class one morning and broke It, he texted and said I had to pay for it, I refused and told him It was his fault and he shouldn't have left the cable there, and I couldn't pay even if I wanted since I don't have any money or a job.\n\nHe bought another cable and things went calm for a few days, but then my dog broke that cable too. I felt a little bit responsable this time because I was at home when it happened. I was at the kitchen making dinner for myself and she was with me, but I lost sight of her and got distracted, I only noticed she was gone when my brother came and said that she broke his cable again, and claimed that this time I had to pay for it, I didn't like his tone so I told him that wasn't my problem and to stfu.\n\nHe then went to our mother and told her the same thing, but she agreed with me that \"he had beed warned and he didn't listen\" and that I couldn't be blamed for that, so I didn't get punished. \n\n\nI feel like I was right but at the same time I do feel responsable for not watching over her, I still feel bad about It and that makes me think I'm in the wrong here.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Edit] Things people asked about:\n\n1. He did not tell me he bought another cable\n\n2. The dog does not have free run on the house\n\n3. She has a crate\n\n4.

What set up do you have for the dog? I ask this, as I am not sure your parents did research before getting a very intelligent breed of dog with very high energy levels for LIFE. These dogs really need at the very least 2-4 hours of intense workout a day. They need a job( even frisbee or obedience, not just working the fields) While chewing and destructive issues just happen with ALL puppies, this dog won\u2019t \u201csettle down\u201d with age. I don\u2019t want to be a killjoy. I am trying to be honest. Please research your dog\u2019s breed. Your parents should have done that. Your dog will be 10 steps ahead of you, because that is what they were bred for, to be super smart, think for themselves. Good luck. Edit: I didn\u2019t address the cord issue. You should pay, BUT you should also be prepared to work this pup out A LOT.

It is your responsibility to watch over your dog or to make sure she can't be destructive. You also ha e to actovely train her not to chew on things. She can electrocute herself chewing on cords like that. Tell your brother you will pay for the second cable if he stops leaving them out. Tell him you won't be able to pay for any more.", "YTA\n\nPuppies chew things. A lot. Especially when they are teething. But there are numerous ways to protect important things like cables (not just because they are expensive, but also because there's a real risk of injuring your dog if he bites a live wire). It's on you as his owner to protect your dog from that risk. Once was a learning curve for you, twice was *you* not taking the necessary steps. \n\nPut the cable inside something, a tube, a pipe, tin foil, toilet rolls, cover it in cardboard, spray it with something bitter etc. Get your dog more chew toys. If he's inclined to get into trouble when unsupervised, find a way to supervise him (play pen, closed doors, long indoor leash, lots of ways).\n\nYes, your brother was an idiot not to take steps to protect his cable himself the second time, but he shouldn't have had to do so. That's *your* responsibility.

There\u2019s cord casings/protectors available, he could put a rug over it, or find a reinforced cable that\u2019s harder to chew through. \n\nThat being said, from here on out I would pay special attention to punishing the dog (firm \u201cno\u201d and hold mouth shut for a few seconds, or something similar, obviously don\u2019t hurt them) for chewing/bad behavior, to try and prevent this from ever happening again.

He was warned and ignored the warnings. Puppies are so fast, even when you are watching them, and training them not to chew doesn't happen overnight. That said, for the puppy's safety, you want to make sure someone is watching him if he's not crated or in a puppy proofed area until you can trust him not to chew things he shouldn't. \n\nWhat kind of 30+ year old expects his kid brother to pay to replace something broken accidentally, even if you were at fault (which to be clear, I don't think you were)? Your brother is an AH.", "YTA Yup puppies are silly and chew things but you know that and even though you told them there are still always things people miss.

And it\u2019s time for your brother to go home.", "YTA\n\nAllowing your puppy access to electrical cords at a time in his life where teething causes him to chew is irresponsible. It's easy enough to make a wire unattractive to a puppy but you don't seem to have made any effort.
