Along with other investments and purchases I bought a restaurant that was doing okay. I didn't change the menu/recipes and the original owners are still involved. Kept the same layout because it is an old restaurant with regulars. Apparently this is my ex's favorite restaurant. It was a special thing with her now deceased mother. They would come here frequently and it was a personal thing to her. I never knew this beforehand because this was between her and her mom. Her mom's been gone for a while so she goes there to reminisce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't changed the layout or menu. I just switched out some lazy staff. The chef and recipes is all the same. Only real change I made was revamp the bar and drinks. So she isn't upset about that. I'm hardly at the restaurant but I am there at times and she saw me. She wasn't upset on first glance. It was pretty normal and she asked how my life was. When I told her that I owned the place she switched and got pissed. She explained the history and what this place means to her. I just said that was nice and that I would be keeping things the same so don't worry. She is pissed that her patronage will  put money in my pocket. She thinks I did this out of spite but I never knew about her connection with this place. Even if I did, given the opportunity, I still probably would purchase the place knowing that.

That would be some kind of spite, haha, it made me laugh. Anyway NTA, history is just that, and you can't keep everything as it used to be. You do you, and if she is looking for spite, you can always evict her. NTA", "NTA.  Wow!  You ex really needs to get over herself.  Not everything is about her.", "NTA, As you didn't know it was her favorite restaurant. As well, It's perfectly okay for her to feel sad, upset, etc. that what she thought was the safe place is no longer the case.", "NTA.  You didn't know. She never told you. It isn't like you are preventing her patronage. This is a her issue.", "Sweet fantasy", "NTA she will have to decide if she would rather continue to enjoy the memories she has with her mother or add a few dollars to your business. She is just beings spiteful.", "NTA - Entirely in your right to do this. She is being completely unreasonable.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIgnore her, not your drama.  LEt her come to yur restaurant or not, jsut as she choses.", "NAH, if you didn't know, you didn't know, and there's no way you could be the a******. That being said, she's not really the a****** either. If she continues to throw fits, she will cross that line. But right now she's just a grieving person, who doesn't know how to deal with her grief.", "NAH. Your decision had nothing to do with your relationship & she's entitled to her feelings.", "NTA. She sounds toxic.", "NTA, IF you genuinely didn't know. \n\nHowever, I just find it really really hard to believe that when dating someone for 4/5 YEARS, you never found out what her favourite restaurant was.", "NTA \n\nBusiness is business", "NTA and congratulations on your success as a young business owner.", "NtA.. what did she expect after you guys broke up? That you would just stop existing and not do anything anymore?  Not likely.  It is what it is", "NTA. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re not actually buying and changing the restaurant solely to make her mad, then I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Its yours and you can change it however you want, and if that pisses her off then so be it. But If you only do it to make her mad then yeah you\u2019d be TAH. Plus, the fact that you bought the place and you hadn\u2019t even made big changes shows that you\u2019re not trying to get back at her for anything or make her mad. \n\nTo me, it sounds like your ex is just having a hard time knowing you\u2019re in control of something that means a lot to her. Maybe she anticipates you changing everything because of how bad your relationship ended? Either way, if that makes her mad and you\u2019re not doing any of this to mess with her feelings, then don\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA that's strictly a \"her\" problem, and not yours to worry about.", "NTA\n\nDon't borrow her issues; she doesn't hold a mortgage on what you do in life.\n\nSeriously, this is all her reaction to you and your business and it should have no affect on you whatsoever. She's your ex. You're not required to keep up with what your exes do and make sure that your business dealings don't piss them off. Ever.\n\nJust do you. Her reaction is her responsibility, not yours.", "Given that you were with her for approximately 4-5 years I find it hard for you not to have known that this was her favorite restaurant. That said it also doesn\u2019t seem to be down out of spite, NTA.", "nta", "If you are being truthful that you did not know about her connection to the restaurant then you are not an a-hole, but the fact that you are even posing the question (when I think 99.9% of people would not feel bad in your shoes), and then you follow-up with the statement, *\"Even if I did, given the opportunity, I still probably would purchase the place knowing that\"* makes me think you did, in fact, know of the connection.  So, if you did, yes, a bit of an a-hole, only probably because you are still wanting to insert yourself in her life and control or push buttons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
