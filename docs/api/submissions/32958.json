You solved the problem, and noone got hurt. Tbh I think your parents might feel a little bad because nothing they did fixed the issue. Good for you bc I WISH I had a sibling do that for me.", "NTA! Defending your sister was the right thing to do, IMO.  Everyone else was failing her and she was obviously too beaten down to defend herself.\n\nBullies can only bully someone who is isolated and defenseless and you showed her your sister is neither alone or defenseless, and you put the fear of retribution into her if she continues.\n\nWell done!!!", "NTA.

Nobody else did shit. NTA.", "NTA, My brother was bullied all through school.  I stood up to his bully and screamed at him multiple times. Last month I saw the kid that used to bully him at a bar.  I didn't recognize him but he came up to me and said he was sorry for how he treated my brother back in the day.  I guess he had been to jail multiple times and he had time to reflect back on his youth.  He was truly sorry for treating him that way 20 years ago.  His home life was terrible and I did feel bad for him but the way he treated my brother is wrong.  Stand up for your sister.  Defiantly NTA.", "NTA my older brother put my bully in the hospital, this is nothing.", "NTA\n\nProblem solved without violence.\n\nJust make sure your sister isn't cowed by the bully into not reporting continuing issues if they happen.\n\nI've never understood the bullying thing, letting the bullies get away with it by just reporting it to the school. I'd report to the school and then to the cops. Don't understand why if they get physical it's \"bullying\" if it's a kid but assault if it's an adult.", "NTA. wish you were my sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
