The house is big enough for all of us, tho, 2 of her kids have to share a room. Neither my mom nor their father are in the picture, so we all live here full time, I'm the oldest of the four. \n\nNow, a few months ago my dad begun some remodeling in the house to accommodate them better, so he and the kids had to sleep in other places of the house for a few weeks and their stuff had to be put away, I let them store some of their clothes and their belonging in my closet with the understanding that they had to get their stuff out as soon as the rooms were fixed. I have a pretty big closet, but I don't really own that many clothes, shoes or accessories to fill it, so beside what's already there and some books, I have a lot of space.\n\nPretty soon I realized I made a mistake because they never knocked or asked to be let in my room to get their stuff and they only barged in whenever they wanted, but I sucked it up because I offered. Also besides some small modifications to my room it was pretty left untouched so I didn't had to sleep around the house like them. \n\nNow the issue: The rooms are all fixed and done and they all got back to sleep and have their stuff there, problem is, my step-mom and one of my step-sister's took this ''opportunity'' to buy more stuff and were pretty much left with cramped closets, they still have a bunch of stuff here in my room and they still barge whenever they want and I'm done. I've asked multiple times and my dad has also asked them to take their stuff out but they always complain they don't have space and I do, so ''it hurts no one''. I had enough when yesterday my step-mom barged in and I was changing, she said it was no big deal but I felt so embarrassed that when she left my room I just took their shit out and tossed it in the hallway. \n\nBoth my step-sister and her mom think I'm a selfish ah and my dad grounded me for what I did but ultimately made them take their stuff.

Barging in to your room is a big deal. Bust in on your dad and her in bed a few times, and you'll see how big a deal she *really* thinks it is.\n\nThis is a power-play and a territorial dispute. She's letting you know that this is *her* house and her room, not yours, and she can go wherever she wants whenever she wants, because she is the lady of the house now, and you aren't. It sucks. By grounding you, your dad is reinforcing *her* shitty behaviour, not you.\n\nGet a lock for your door. Are her clothes at least out of your room for good, now?", "NTA and I'd appreciate the peace and quiet during the grounding.  I used to love getting grounding.  I'd stay in my room and read.", "NTA, sweetie I don\u2019t know how old you are but you need to have a talk with your dad about how all of the barging in has effected and how it has built up. If this is going to be a cohesive family your dad needs to help his wife see how she and her daughter weren\u2019t respecting your boundaries. Can you lock your door at all?", "NTA\n\nGet a door jam. Use it when you\u2019re in your room so they have to knock in the future. They can figure out their own storage needs using their own space and brain power. \n\nYour dad should not have grounded you imo unless you literally just threw it all out leaving a mess or in a way that damaged things. If it were me, I\u2019d have loaded it into separate trash bags and bucked them into their respective rooms. Did your dad also ground your stepsister for not getting her stuff out as he asked multiple times? Or is it only your stepmom that gets to make decisions for both her kids and step kid?", "Getting grounded was worth it to get their stuff out of your room. Where you generously offered to *temporarily* let them stash their stuff.\nThey abused your generosity. \n\nNext time, they might think twice. You stood up for yourself. Good job. :)\n\nAt least you didn\u2019t throw it all in trash bags and haul it off to a goodwill. And your dad is playing favorites by punishing you. NTA", "NTA. The request had been made to return to the status quo before the renos, and they're abusing your generosity. \n\nI'd get a lock, since they don't know how to knock. \n\nAnd your father grounding you? Way off side. He's told you who he'll fight for when something is inequitable. It's not you.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t \u201churt no one\u201d when it\u2019s *hurting you*.

Idt you should have been grounded.", "NTA -- but this frequently happens, dads kids get treated badly, mom makes certain her kids come first.

You know we have a saying in Chinese that once you have a stepmother, you have a stepfather too. Your stepmother and stepsisters feeling entitled to your space and your accommodation is shitty of them, but they\u2019re able to feel they can get away with it because either consciously or subconsciously, they know your dad doesn\u2019t 100% have your back. \n\nI think it might be good to have a seriously alone conversation with your dad. \n\nYou did nothing wrong in this situation, and your frustration and ultimate action to throw their stuff into the hall is completely understandable and valid. \n\nOn the other hand, your stepmother and stepsisters took advantage of you, violated your boundaries, and tried to make you feel like you were in the wrong. \n\nBut his reaction is to make them take their stuff back (so, restoring the status quo before this whole situation), but you\u2019re being punished? You didn\u2019t mention them apologising or admitting they were wrong, so I\u2019m assuming they didn\u2019t. So, you were the bigger person, you were wronged, and your dad punished you. \n\nHonestly my heart hurts thinking about the situation you\u2019re in, but I think you should tell him like \u201chey, I did nothing wrong except lay my foot down after repeatedly asking that my boundaries be respected. And I\u2019m your daughter. So even if I did do something a bit extreme, shouldn\u2019t you be the one person who has my back? Why am I being punished, but they don\u2019t even have to apologise?\u201d\n\nHe should be putting your feelings first. Over his new marriage, and definitely over your step sibling. Idk if he\u2019s not doing it or if he\u2019s not realising it\u2019s hurting you. Maybe he\u2019ll apologise and look at your interactions with your stepmother etc differently going forward. Or maybe he\u2019ll think you\u2019re being too dramatic or selfish or whatever else. \n\nEither way, you\u2019ll know your importance to him and where you stand with uk. \n\nYour father should be putting you, his daughter, first, but our fathers don\u2019t always behave how we wish they would toward us. And if you discover you can\u2019t really rely on him, going forward, you just have to build that into your expectations. \n\nSome fathers can\u2019t be relied upon. It\u2019s better to know earlier than later so you don\u2019t keep hoping and getting hurt when he doesn\u2019t come through for you. And if this turns out to be the case, I know it\u2019ll hurt, but life is about give and take. If he doesn\u2019t have your back now against his \u201cnew\u201d family, you don\u2019t owe him anything if he needs you in the future.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "NTA\n\nYour dad should have taken responsibility and insisted they remove their stuff from your room as soon as they moved back to their own rooms.\n\nAND your dad should install a lock on your door.", "NTA. Can you talk to your grandparents about this? You shouldn't have been grounded. Parent or step-parent, no one should barge in your room. Maybe you should barge in their rooms and just say, what, I thought it was no big deal. Your father should have taken your side. You have a right to privacy. The more I read about single mothers with children and how men shouldn't marry them, the more I am starting to agree. Respect needs to go all around, but they have disrespected you and took advantage of your kindness. Your step-mom, stepsister, and dad are the AH.", "NTA. \"It hurts no one\" is their code for \"it doesn't bother me\". If you were having in on their space or while they were changing, they would have have complained.\n\nBuy and install a lock. I real one with a key, not one of those interior button locks. Installing instructions are on yourube.", "NTA and well worth being grounded to buy you peace of mind and sanity!", "NTA. You did good. There are so many solutions for this that do not include your room being warehouse. Why is your dad grounding you?? You did the only thing that works. Your dad is a wimp and is not protecting you or taking care of you well.", "NTA. Your step mom is trying to assert her authority here and walk all over you. Good for you standing up to her and her kids! It sucks being grounded (and this is a bs unfair reason for it) but in the end it\u2019ll be well worth it to not have to deal with anyone in your room. If I were you I would still get a doorknob for your door that locks or a door jam though. Either can be bought off Amazon for less than $10.", "Your dad agreed with you\u2026 and then grounded you?! Sounds like it\u2019s time for a sit down with your father. State everything exactly as you did here. Point out that you were gracious and accommodating during the remodel and now they are taking advantage of you and violating your privacy. That\u2019s not fair and wasn\u2019t the deal. You BOTH asked for SM and SS to move their stuff out, multiple times. So after the most recent violation of your privacy *while you were undressed* you put an end to the problem by getting their belongings out of your space. So what, exactly are you being punished for? And what, exactly, does he think should have been the reaction to your sm barging into your room all the time and disrespecting you and your space? Would sexual harassment charges be better (/s). Would he like it if you started barging into their room whenever you want- even during their private activities? Obviously not. \n\nDad is trying to take both sides and he\u2019s failing. You should be his first priority. So it\u2019s time for a serious discussion. \n\nNTA and good for you for sticking up for yourself. Hugs and high fives to you from this random internet mom.", "NTA. Put a lock on your door or a wedge under it.", "Nta. Ask your dad for a lock", "Sorry for the unwarranted grounding OP. However, you got your room back. Your steps are pretty pushy. NTA", "NTA , tell dad it may not have been a big deal for her to see you in undress, but it was for you . You want a lock and their shit forever banned from your room .", "NTA. Locks on doors make for better cohabitation in my experience.", "NTA. Worth the grounding to get their stuff out permanently ,but your dad shouldn\u2019t have grounded you.", "NTA, your dad is for grounding you. That was a temporary situation, and they had no right barging in your room whenever they felt like it.", "Go \u201cstore\u201d some stuff in stepsister\u2019s and parents\u2019 room while you reorganize/rearrange your room during your \u201cgrounding\u201d and barge in as needed.  Be prepared to have your retinas destroyed by barging in on the parentals though.", "You're NTA. But that's probably not going to help you in this situation. The new people outnumber you and the new girls have a bargaining chip you don't: their mother is bedding your father. So perhaps apologize, not because you owe it, but to calm the home. Then ask, calmly, for a mutual agreement that will satisfy everyone, since the remodel apparently left the other bedrooms' closet space lacking. Try being meek, even though you don't feel it.\nAnd look forward to moving out eventually.", "You're NTA... But I probably would have gotten so damn petty and made sure I was doing something to traumatize them when they next walk in... I'm talking \"private time\" with a favorite toy. Because then if they try to complain you could say \"well it's my room, and I need my privacy. Maybe next time you could idk, knock like someone with manners?\"\n\nBut I'm so sorry you're dealing with that.", "NTA. As most men know.  Some women have no boundaries when it comes to closet space or bathroom counters.  Put a lock on your door and your closet door.", "If items got damaged, it sounds like you were throwing things, not just removing them from your room. Is that correct?\n\nIf I am correct, then you are not wrong for removing them, but you are wrong for being destructive. I am guessing that's what got you grounded.", "YTA.

You did them a favor when they needed it and now they are taking advantage.\n\nIt sounds like your dad is on your side at least so I think the next step is to ask him for a door lock if for reason you don't already have one.

You are the ah", "I feel so sorry for your kids if you have any.", "I assume you have adult children or siblings who no longer speak to you?", "If I was the OP, I'd take dad aside and tell him that you have been more than hospitable - generous, even - to his new wife and her kids, and her response was to start a war over your bedroom. Let him know that this is absolutely not on. She is not your mother, and she is never going to *be* your mother, and you will accept parental authority only from him. She's just another adult who lives in the house.\n\nThe compromise you offer is that you will be civil, all foreign material leaves your room, and that you get a lock for the door. The alternative he faces is a household at war and (eventually) an estranged daughter. *No one* will enjoy that, but that's what's going to happen if he insists on it.\n\nIf it comes to a negotiation, you can give way on the parental authority part, but hold the line on everything else.", "Yeah... He got grounded for that ........?????? O.o", "I think he just said that to appease your stepmother. Your probably grounded in name only.", "I was a bookish kid who stayed home and introverted most of the time. I got \u201cgrounded\u201d the non-specific way, where it\u2019s not \u201cfrom the computer\u201d or \u201cfrom your phone\u201d or some such, exactly once. I assumed it was the classic \u201cno going out with your friends,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t stated. \n\nNothing really changed, which is, I expect, why my parents never felt the need to try it a second time.", "If that is the case he may just be doing lip service to keep the peace. Keep your mouth shut. Talk to him after you've finished your sentence & everyone has cooled off. Be rational, no one deserves to be a 2nd class citizen.", "I'm also assuming that it's just you can't go out with your friends, especially since nothing was taken away.  That type of grounding is common for folks your dad's age (or what I'm assuming his age is).", "INFO: do your step mom or step sisters do other things that cross boundaries?", "When I was a kid (oh so many years ago) \u201cgrounded\u201d meant like when a plane is grounded, no going anywhere. It never meant confiscating things or banning tv etc. Just no leaving the house and/or garden. My parents rarely figured out that I\u2019d rather stay in my room with a book and that telling me to \u201cgo outside\u201d was the thing I hated most.", "If I am serious about punishing my introvert children, I give them an electronics ban. Either your father doesn't understand you at all or more likely, he wants step mum to stop complaining so he gave you a punishment she thinks is terrible but he knows isn't actually a punishment. OP is NTA. Your father is an AH for taking the path of least resistance and letting OP be the bad guy instead of telling step mum and step siblings to pull their heads in and stop being AHs, even if he didn't actually give her a real \"punishment\". Just keep quiet, fly under the radar and \"suffer\" in your room on your ipad for a day or two.", "Mine used to take my books away and send me outside to play. Shudder.", "Library alone... sadness.", "Yep, same. With bonus kid it meant no library trips which was his favorite place when he was younger. (For not being biologically related to me at all he is astoundingly like me.)", "Please make it a habit to lock your door, and if it's easy to unlock from outside, a lot of them are, buy a cheap door stopper from the grocery store to push under your door so they can't come in, or get a keyed lock for your door so no one can enter when you aren't home. \n\nBig changes for all of you, but basic respect is important and they clearly have no respect.\n\nEdit:spelling", "Oh good, you have a lock! I was thinking you didn't. Good.  \ud83d\udc4d", "Actually it's op's dad's house from before marrying stepmom, so no, it's not their house. It's op's house.", "Apparently moms kids get better treatment.", "He wasn't fixing it. That's the thing. He was waiting for you to just accept the \"new norm\".\n\nNTA, OP. You didn't break anything. It's just clothes and shoes. They are making a stink because they want YOUR space.", "Your dad sounds like the conflictbavoidant type. How are things with the other 2 stepsisters?", "NTA. Your dad was never going to figure anything out which he further confirms by siding with them. Also, what was there to figure out exactly?? The stuff needed to be out of the room. It is not rocket science.\n\nThey are all pissy because you stood up for yourself and their little maneuvers failed. So now they are trying different maneuvers by playing grand victims. Shitty people. Shitty father.", "What????\n\nWith this information,  i can say definitely NTA.\n\nYou have been asking for things to be moved. This should have been done within 1 weekend of the updates being done.", "That makes no sense. The child does not own the house. They get no say in where the adults put things. They have no right to touch an adult's property and throw it anywhere. Why not talk to their father about it? This was the wrong way to handle it.", "Why? Because I think OP handled the situation poorly? OP did. There are better ways to handle things, and they have no right to throw an adult's stuff anywhere. They deserve to be grounded and need to learn to handle problems better.", "That makes no sense. My daughter lives with me, and we are very close. My sister was just here last week. Odd assumption to make.", "Also, OP was nice about just chucking their stuff into the hallway.  It could have been put outside on the curb by the garbage cans.", "Honestly I'd make sure there was a caveat about the Instant she becomes unreasonable (she will, she's proven that) it'll be the end of any parental authority.  She's shown she doesn't respect OP to the point that she thinks it's \"no big deal\" barging in while she's changing.  Something that most people desire privacy for and the LAW specifically states one is supposed to have privacy for.  So given Any authority I'd put good money on Lady Tremaine here demanding \"oh you left one dish in the sink, you're grounded for a month.\"", "This is excellent.", "In my experience newly married men with prior kids will often prioritize the new wife. However, you came up with an ingenious solution. Put a lock on the inside AND outside of your door.", "I was a reader... reading full romance novels and literary classics by the time I was eight. My mom would ground me from reading anything that wasn't schoolwork.", "I'm not an outgoing type of person, so I don't think that's the case. I like to be on my iPad a lot, drawing and such, but he didn't took that nor my kindle so idk what he meant, don't wanna ask either", "yeah she has allowed her youngest to take my stuff (iPad, books, art supplies or just be in my room since I have a hanging egg chair that she likes. I always have to snatch my stuff back and kick her out of my room.", "No. Stepmom is married to Dad. It's her house with her husband. The child owns no part of the house.", "The mother's children probably don't throw her stuff around.", "I\u2019ll be on the lookout for the update in the near future where stepmom\u2019s demanding OP switch rooms with her daughter so she can have the bigger closet.", "one is just like the others and the other one is fine, she's actually the one who's always apologizing and looking ashamed when her family fucks with me", "[removed]", "I bet your kids had a happy childhood. Your screen name sound like it fits your personality, a  total ah", "Children are people too, and have a right to privacy.  I really hope you don\u2019t ever have kids.", "She did talk to dad about it. Dad talks to them, it did no good. Read the post again", "Reasonable. I spotted that loophole, later.", "Me too.  When I got grounded, I was grounded FROM reading.  (Nerd then, nerd now, I guess.)", "I mean, what else was there that would actually work as a punishment? And I would think that it made you want to read more, so still a win.\n\nI was trying to think of a stronger punishment before reading this, I came close: Telling the child to give you the book they are half way through, they'll get it back in a week.", "Oh man that's terrible, I would have lost my mind. No books is cruel and unusual punishment.", "Same here, though I was and still am a sci fi nerd. I'd read my dad's old sci fi books like crazy. Got grounded from reading, so I snuck a book into the bathroom and hid it in a drawer under towels. Forgot to take it out and got grounded longer when my mom was putting laundry away. Nerd yes, but not very clever...", "So glad to know that I wasn\u2019t the only one who was grounded from reading! I would just hang out in my room reading anyway, and hide the book when I heard footsteps.", "I hid books to get around that punishment. Yeah you can have everything but my stash.", "I say, either every time you\u2019re in your room, be completely and utterly naked, and/or start putting strange and creepy paraphernalia around your room.

Tell him you'd like to instal a hook lock inside our door to prevent anyone from barging while you're in there. You could also have a lock installed on your handle so that no one can get in while you're gone.\n\nIf nothing else, talking to him about rational solutions to the situation should allow you to impress upon him how this situation has made you feel.", "Buy a door stop, use it to hold your door closed if needed. No lock needed. They don't need to know you have it and the only reason they'd find out is if they tried to barge in when you want privacy. NTA but stepwitch is.\n\nETA 3 words", "When you talk to your dad tell him it's unacceptable for the youngest to take your stuff or to come into your room without permission.\n\nPut a password on your IPad. You need at least a king drawer to secure your things.", "This is simply not okay. If your dad wants peace at home, he has to support and respect your privacy. You need a lock on your door and he needs to insist that his wife and step kids respect boundaries like staying out of your room and not taking your stuff.

The house would be inherited by his daughter, not his wife and definitely not her daughters.", "Owned before marriage= not marital asset", "WEll, they shoul not dump it in her room.  I do not think OP puts her stuff in their room, or goes in without knocking.", "Yo, stepmom, no one pulled your lever here", "It's not their house. They have no right to put their hands on stepmom's property. There are better ways to handle things. The stepmom can put her stuff wherever she wants in her home.
