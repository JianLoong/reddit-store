And fyi, all teens complain about parents. \n\nIf the mom goes to court, your brother may lose parenting time, or may be told if he cannot be with kid on his time, he has to give time back to the mom. \n\nThis is parental alienation.   YOu are not the mom. \n\nKnock it off.", "YTA\n\nNot everyone is going to like how others dress, especially between parent & child. If your niece is more concerned about how her mom dresses than her mom actually attending games, then soon enough, your niece will learn that it's important for parents to be there regardless. \n\nYou, however, should have just been there as Aunt since that's literally all you are to her. To let your niece post on social media claiming you as mom should have been shut down because others will see it, including family. \n\nYou condone letting your niece write her real mom off as some stranger over how her mom dresses? Really, she's not getting abused, starved, or homeless, just the way she dresses.", "YTA, OP. You are stealing the mother\u2019s identity and colluding with your husband\u2019s niece in erasing her mother from her family for the sake of perceived social acceptance. You are teaching the girl to deny her mother exists, which seems to me to be a moral crime. She needs to accept her mother as she is and own up to her being her mother, and treat her well and respectfully. Instead, you join her in looking down on her own mother for her attire, and denying who she is. Her attire doesn\u2019t sound awful to me, but even if it were, she needs to be treated with respect. You sound like you let flattery go to your head. That\u2019s appalling that you would join your niece in that deception and cruelty.", "YTA. You are acting entitled over your niece. Don't pretend you're not doing what we all think you are. This is ugly behavior.", "**YTA** \\- It is fine to accompany your niece, but posing as her mom is an AH move.  Next time tell the truth: you are her aunt.  This is identity theft.  It is an autonomy violation of your niece's mom.", "You are everything she called you and probably more.\n\nYTA", "YTA, plain and simple. It\u2019s normal for teenagers to think their parents dress horribly. Her sense of fashion doesn\u2019t mean she is a bad parent to her child, and you pretending to be this girl\u2019s mother is extremely overstepping boundaries.", "YTA. Mind your own business and grow the hell up.", "Definitely an asshole.", "YTA here. You encouraged and helped your niece lie. You faked being her mother, which makes you a liar, too. \n\nYou clearly don't respect your brother's ex, but teaching your niece that it's OK to lie about something as serious as who her own mother is, over something as insignificant as not liking her wardrobe is just a bad precedent to set. \n\nI'd be curious to know what your brother thought about you encouraging his kid to lie about her mom.", "I highly doubt this is real, but if it is you\u2019re obviously the AH. How she dresses is none of your business and it\u2019s not your place AT ALL to get in between that conversation that needs to happen between her and her daughter.", "YTA. \n\nFlat shoes? The ABSOLUTE HORROR. \ud83d\ude12", "YTA", "YTA\n\nEvery teen is embarrassed that parents exist. You seem to enjoy showing up mom as much as  supporting your niece.", "I\u2019m unclear as to what you expected if being considered an asshole wasn\u2019t your goal or why it surprises you.", "YTA", "YTA. The mom is absolutely correct to call you the b word. You are rather enjoying playing mom. If you really cared about your niece you would have an honest dialog with her mother, not try to usurp her position.", "YTA. And what are you going to do when people find out you are her dad's sister?", "YTA of course. Kids are embarassed of their parents, that's their job. Your job as a parent is to teach them that judging others by their looks is unkind, and that nobody gets to dictate another adult's healthy self-expression. You failed and decided to act like an immature child yourself.", "are you sure you're not the 15 year old?  grow up, and learn your place.

Jesus, you're attacking this woman over what she chooses to wear? You pretended to be her daughter's mother? Psycho vibes here.", "YTA.   Shallow puddle much?", "YTA and a weirdo. All teens are embarrassed by their parents\n\nHow long have you been in some weird competition with your ex sil?", "YTA ugh this is gross, instead of helping a kid learn a valuable lesson you chose to go along with an idiotic plan that you knew would hurt her mother.", "YTA, a Mean Girl the mental age of your niece if that, and from the sound of it, you probably think the Kartrashians are chic and tasteful, lol.  Did you wear FM heels and show off your $2 d\u00e9colletage at the soccer field? How shallow and ugly can you be?  Nasty.", "Please tell me on what planet a 15yo is not embarrassed by their mom? Since the beginning of time this always the case. YTA should have told your niece to talk to her mom. Maybe give her kind words to use. Just stay out of it.", "YTA. Oh my god you are a horrible human being. For a teenager that behaviour might be excusable, even though it\u2019s already questionable. But you enabling her, and judging the mom\u2019s way of dressing? You are acting like a pubescent bully.", "Parental alienation? How exactly did I alienate her? Did I buy the clothes for her?\n\nAlso what idiot judge is gonna take away my brother's custody because he *goes to work*?", "This. \n\nYTA. \n\nIt's not like her mother is dressing inappropriately, it is normal for kids to go through this phase, and it's not your place.", "I never, not even once, said I'm her mom. My niece called me mom and introduced me as mom", "Identity theft?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "With LONG SLEEVES??? Stop the presses.", "By calling yourself mom.   Only the parents get to be called mom.  If he cannot control you, that is a problem.", "YTA a hundred times over. Your edits make you more of TA.", "You are claiming a parental place publicly and undermining niece\u2019s relationship with her mom by affirming, condoning, and encouraging her distance from her parent because she doesn\u2019t like Mom\u2019s clothes. Yes, this could affect custody.\n\nAnd by the way, it was really embarrassing to read how very shallow you and niece are - and even more embarrassing to read how blind you are to it. I always hope for more out of women than this - hurts my feminist heart to see a woman degrade another for her fashion.", "You agreed to go pretend to be her Mom and let her introduce you that way.", "You should have stopped her. Explained that she shouldn't be ashamed of her mom if she dressed a little different.", "You are the adult. You went along with her deception, and so are just as guilty, if not more, of all that is wrong with this.", "Also you asked if you were the AH or not so can you try understanding on why you were the Ah and why people are calling you out for it? Rather than continuously defending yourself try understanding what people are trying to tell you for God's sake.", "But you didn\u2019t correct her. So you are condoning her lies.", "And you are the adult who completely enabled her. And you are obviously enjoying this. I hope your brother and his ex find a way to cut out your toxic presence from your niece's life. YTA.", "You literally pretended to be her mom. You're a liar and so is your niece.", "It is called collusion. You were still an active participant. Don't play all innocent now.", "Lying by omission is still lying?", "And you didn't correct her. She's 15. That was a teaching moment and you failed.", "Dude, I had a grandma who picked me up in bell bottoms and tube tops and a mom who would show up in two different kinds of plaid bc she was working around the house and just didn\u2019t care.\n\nOf the things that have hurt me in my life, I can truly say that doesn\u2019t even rank. In fact, I respect their commitment to their tastes, however different they may be. I\u2019ve even stolen some of my mom\u2019s old shirts bc now they\u2019re in style. I was fine, even with the mild embarrassment that actually reflected on my classmates, and your niece will be just fucking fine, too.", "Yes, pretending to be someone you are not. You think it is funny. Why even ask if YTA when you are not open to feedback. You are a horrible influence on your niece's life and I hope your brother and her mom cut you off."]}
