And fyi, all teens complain about parents. \n\nIf the mom goes to court, your brother may lose parenting time, or may be told if he cannot be with kid on his time, he has to give time back to the mom. \n\nThis is parental alienation.   YOu are not the mom. \n\nKnock it off.", "YTA\n\nNot everyone is going to like how others dress, especially between parent & child. If your niece is more concerned about how her mom dresses than her mom actually attending games, then soon enough, your niece will learn that it's important for parents to be there regardless. \n\nYou, however, should have just been there as Aunt since that's literally all you are to her. To let your niece post on social media claiming you as mom should have been shut down because others will see it, including family. \n\nYou condone letting your niece write her real mom off as some stranger over how her mom dresses? Really, she's not getting abused, starved, or homeless, just the way she dresses.", "YTA, OP. You are stealing the mother\u2019s identity and colluding with your niece in erasing her mother from her family for the sake of perceived social acceptance. You are teaching the girl to deny her mother exists, which seems to me to be a moral crime. She needs to accept her mother as she is and own up to her being her mother, and treat her well and respectfully. Instead, you join her in looking down on her own mother for her attire, and denying who she is. Her attire doesn\u2019t sound awful to me, but even if it were, she needs to be treated with respect. You sound like you let flattery go to your head. That\u2019s appalling that you would join your niece in that deception and cruelty.", "YTA. You are acting entitled over your niece.

It\u2019s normal for teenagers to think their parents dress horribly.

Mind your own business and grow the hell up.", "Definitely an asshole.", "YTA here. You encouraged and helped your niece lie. You faked being her mother, which makes you a liar, too. \n\nYou clearly don't respect your brother's ex, but teaching your niece that it's OK to lie about something as serious as who her own mother is, over something as insignificant as not liking her wardrobe is just a bad precedent to set. \n\nI'd be curious to know what your brother thought about you encouraging his kid to lie about her mom.", "I highly doubt this is real, but if it is you\u2019re obviously the AH.

How could you agree to do something this terrible? The only appropriate thing to do would have been to tell your niece that you'd love to go to her game but that she shouldn't be embarrassed by her mother.

She should have used this as a teaching moment but chose to be a bully. So yes she would never be around my child again. If my kid turned 18 and decided to go running to her bully of an aunt then so be it.", "LOL!", "Fuck that call the FBI!! This woman subjected a whole team of teenagers to poor fashion choices! (Hoping the irony in that is obvious because hooboy teenagers have some *regrettable* choices.)", "Awww this is adorable.", "Don\u2019t forget the *ugly flats*", "Yes my mom uses me as a example of a good kid", "I mean, really. Her *clothes*. I'm absolutely flabbergasted", "Right?! The comment about her dressing like a beggar because she wears long sleeved shirts and long skirts\u2026seriously?!

I would hope no actual grown adult is that shallow and immature.", "Was both a 15 year old girl and had a 15 year old girl. Can definitely confirm. She -hated- my clothes at 15.

If you need me I'll be packing.\" Thats assuming she lives with mom now, based off the post, I think she already lives with dad. In that case, there might not be a conversation at all, just \"Okay\" and next time visitation comes up, she's old enough to decide she doesn't want too.\n\nBecause thats *exactly* how I would have handled it when I was 15.
