So like 17 when she said her greatest fear would be ending up a pregnant and unmarried teen right out of high school. Which, obviously she should never had said to you! But is a reasonable stance\u2026and again she was a teenager\u2026.and she apologized and this was over a decade ago. \n\nYou totally glanced over the \u201churtful stuff\u201d you said back to her. But I\u2019m sure it was ugly, too. \n\nAnd you\u2019re STILL holding a grudge and ruining the family. I feel badly for Laura and I\u2019m proud of Josh for standing up for his wife! I also think it\u2019s crazy that people think that it\u2019s cool to be so incredibly rude/hurtful as to exclude her from a family wedding to and then just expect her to happily send her kids along. Lol. No. That\u2019s not how that works.", "YTA.\n\nA teenage girl said something that hurt your feelings, years and years ago, and you are still punishing her for it.\n\nWas what she said insensitive?\n\nSure it was.\n\nWas it also true?\n\nYou bet it was. Many teenagers harbor a fear of an unplanned pregnancy. \n\nI get why this hurt your feelers, but she was a child at the time. Just drop the petty grudge holding already and recognize that all human beings are imperfect. \n\nYou should have let this go years ago.", "YTA. This is petty as all hell. You're holding a grudge over something she said when she was a teenager? Are you sure you're mature enough to be married?", "I'm sure mine will be a very unpopular opinion, but I don't think it is ever appropriate to invite just one half of an established couple to a wedding or other formal event. It's just rude.   \nYou don't have to like her, you don't have to speak to her, but like her or not she is your BIL's wife and should be invited.   \nYTA for keeping the grudge.", "I came expecting this to be about not having your SIL in your wedding party, as a bridesmaid or something. But not even invited to the wedding, because she hurt you several years ago where you turned the whole family against her? Too far. Good on your BIL for standing up for his wife. \n\nYTA", "\u2026it\u2019s pretty unfair you\u2019re still holding a grudge over a insensitive comment said by a teenaged girl. But let\u2019s be honest, no sixteen year old would want to get pregnant out of graduation. At least not me. She was a teenager when she made that comment, wasn\u2019t she? Since according to your timeline, the argument happened a year after they started dating. You need to let this go. You\u2019re being immature. YTA", "YTA.  You tired to drive a wedge between your BIL and his wife, and you were always going to lose that one.  And you have held a grudge for over a decade about a fight in which you admit you were also at fault.  Are you pleased with yourself for destroying your fianc\u00e9\u2019s relationship with his brother?", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years, it\u2019s time to let it go. At the time yes, I understand your hurt feelings but seriously - you\u2019ve proved her point wrong, you\u2019ve been with your partner 15 years and you\u2019ve had 3 kids and your happy. \n\nHappiness & love isn\u2019t defined by marriage as teenagers seem to think. So get over it.", "So at around 17 this girl - who was a teenager - made a stupid comment, one that a lot of teenagers would probably say, about how they didn't want to have kids right after highschool without being settled down yet and you've now decided to hold that against her for life? I 100% know I've said the same shit when I was a teenager. Are you sure you still arent 17? Because this is childish as hell. Especially since she's apologized.\n\nYou even admit that you ALSO threw hurtful words back at her, so you're literally no better than her. Even with your \"I would've never told her so if she would've kept her mouth shut.\" bullshit. But unlike what she did - which was one hurtful comment, once, AS A TEENAGER - you've completely ostracized her from the entire family, and by BIL's account you've been the sole reason she's missed MANY family events for years. If she could be the bigger person enough to invite you - who again ALSO said hurtful things! - to her wedding to try to keep the peace, then it shows how much of an asshole you are that you can't do the same.\n\nYTA. You either invite both of them and grow the hell up, or you invite neither of them and let them get on with their lives without a petty, grudge holding sister in law holding them down.", "YTA \n\nThis is just petty, it was one comment years ago (and a completely valid comment at that). Get over it.", "YTA. You're so toxic wow", "YTA.  Why would you even think your BIL would show up without his wife?  Would your husband show up without you?  Would you send your kids without being present?  She apologized, so why are you still mad?  Is it worth continuing an argument that impacts the entire family over something so petty?", "so you\u2019ve been holding a grudge for what a 17 year old said \u2026. a decade ago? \n\nlol the SIL was right - who wants to end up a vindictive, mean and petty high school graduate?\n\nYTA", "Idk I think YTA. This whole argument happened how long ago? She was like 16 an don high school! Most teenagers don\u2019t want to be teens moms right out of high school. But she did apologize. You\u2019re not obligated to forgive and forget but this is BIL\u2019s wife. It should be expected that he will side with her when she\u2019s not invited to family events. You can invite just him, but that has consequences, and that consequence is that he may not come. And you can\u2019t force him too. Your invitation is just that, it\u2019s not a summons. Whether you like it or not, she\u2019s family. BIL chose to marry and spend the rest of his life with her. She made a insensitive and hurtful remark years ago and apologizes but yet you\u2019re holding onto this grudge against her for it. You\u2019re being vindictive and petty over something that happened like 10 years ago. I think your other SIL is right, you need to let it go and move on! Not saying your need to be best friends with Laura, but damn, she was young and dumb and she apologized for her comment. You need to grow up a bit.", "YTA\n\nHas your SIL done anything else within the last decade to warrant this type of treatment? Have you not grown, as a person, a mother, a partner, over the last decade? Do you not think that SIL is capable of the same?\n\nSomething tells me you already know the answer to this, but you're refusing to accept it. Your other SIL said it anyway:\n\n>My husband's sister (f25) told us that we need to let this go because   \nit's been a decade from my argument with her and she was only a teenager  \n who said dumb stuff.\n\nShe's absolutely right.", "How would you feel if a family member cut off your eldest daughter forever because she said something hurtful as a teenager?\n\nYTA, OP. It sounds like you have a major complex around your life choices that hasn't faded with age, and you feel the need to continue punishing SIL because of it. The reality is, most people fear being unmarried, pregnant, and unable to attend college. That is a rational worry, and teenagers aren't known for their great control over who they spew their feelings out over.  Unless she's continued to denigrate you and say snide things about how your life is lesser, you're in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nYou love your life, right? You're happy and proud? Her fears, when she was still a kid and full of dreams and worries, were *wrong*, were they not? Living well is the best revenge, and you've done it. Holding on to this isn't making you happier, your family closer, or your life easier.", "Not only are YTA A big one at that), but you sound petty, toxic, lazy and someone that I would avoid.  \n\n15 years and still not married - sounds like your \"fianc\u00e9\" wanted to keep his options open.", "My worst fear these days is to hold a grudge against a family member for something thoughtless they said when they were a teenager. If I am still fixated on something a teenage girl said ten years ago then I have limited my ability to have a full life and appreciate emotional nuance and empathy.\n\nLet it go. If only for your own sake. It's holding you back.", "Ironically, I don\u2019t want to be like you either. Not everyone deserves forgiveness and to stay in our lives when they hurt us. But this is, quite frankly, stupid at this point. You\u2019re being petty, vindictive, and immature. I would want to show grace as well as teach my kids kindness. You\u2019re alienating family members and stewing bad blood. You seem to think that having someone do something painful toward you justifies a lifetime of payback and contempt. Some actions do deserve a severing of ties. This is not even close to being one of those things. Your offense is far, far worse. YTA.", "YTA\n\nI usually subscribe to your wedding, your rules. I still do. But you knowingly excluded your SIL from a wedding invitation while inviting your BIL. You knowingly added drama to a situation that it sounds like is mostly being created by you. If you didn't want SIL there you should've talked to BIL like an adult to explain your side. Instead, you knew full well your reasoning is petty as hell and went passive aggressive stirring more trouble. You sound exhausting. You have the attitude of a teenager. Speaking of which, SIL was ~17 and you were ~22 when you had that argument. SIL was literally in high school. You would think someone with 3 kids would be able to understand how children mature over time. Instead, you are choosing to screw up your HUSBAND'S side of the family with your inconsiderate attitude. It's not even your family that you are blowing up. Grow up.", "Stop acting like a child ? if you can't get over a 10 year argument what does it say about you really ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA 10 / 10", "YTA. She was SEVENTEEN when she said that!! And it was ELEVEN YEARS ago!!  It is time to bury the hatchet, have a conversation with her and explain that you understand that people say stupid stuff, especially when young, that they later regret.  You admit that even you said some hurtful stuff at the time, and you are five years older than her. I think that apologies are way overdue for both of you. Time to move on. Start your wedding with a new beginning for your relationship with her.  All your grudge is doing is hurting everyone around you.", "YTA.\n\nI don't even know how to explain it because I can't imagine inviting someone and their kids, but not inviting the wife and mother of those kids.", "YTA, you ve already made her miss several family events as punishment for sth she said as a teenager and she apologized for. Good for the BIL for finally sticking up for his wife, he should ve done this long ago.", "YTA- your husbands sister is right. This is a decade old argument based off of the words of a dumb teenager and you choosing it to be your hill to die on. You've used it as a way to isolate Laura from her husbands family. Laura and your BIL have been married for years now and have children. It's time to let this go or you're going to continue to be the reason there's divide in this family", "YTA. Don\u2019t post here if you can\u2019t accept the judgement. You are the AH plain and simple. You were 22 and a mom 2 who insulted a teenager. Sure it was shit what she said but you were a grown up and she a teenager. You are so hypocritical. Get over yourself. You are not mature enough to have kids.", "Yes, it was hurtful. She was also a kid when she said it. And she apologized. And it\u2019s been years. \n\nThe real issue is WHY it affected you so much. Clearly, you are deeply insecure and probably, in your heart, believe those words are reasonable and they highlight your own disappointment with your choices. \n\nYTA because this is petty as hell. And YTA again for literally asking for judgment and then debating it in the comments. Christ on a bike, WHY do people do that?!", "YTA\n\nI am amazed you're holding into something a dumb teenager said over a decade ago, particularly when you apparently retaliated AND involved the in-laws. \n\nLet it go because as it stands it's you that looks petty and childish, not your SiL.", "YTA. Although you and hubs have final say over guest list and who you ultimately invite is your prerogative, your SIL does make a valid point. You've morphed from petty to spiteful; petty would be seating her at the back of the room. If BIL can improve, why can't his wife? More importantly, ask yourself: how important is having your BIL and the kids at your wedding? More important than a grudge? I love me a good grudge but is it worth it?", "You\u2019ve been together 13 years and have a 14 year old? \nThe math ain\u2019t adding up", "I don't know how you have the time and energy to run a household with 3 kids AND hold that grudge for 11 yrs. You aren't teenagers anymore. Grow up, accept her apology, and move on.", "YTA. Let it go. How thin is your skin that your still falling apart over something someone said to you 10 years ago?", "Your husband's sister is right.  I literally cannot count high enough to get to the number of times I said stupid or offensive things when I was young and immature.  Did she screw up?  Yeah.  To hold this grudge for the rest of your life for this is just as immature as what she did.  Let's be honest here, she was right.  I had my oldest at 19.  It was HARD.  Of course, I don't need to tell you how hard it was to be that young and have kids.  Most people struggle for years to get over the hump in your same situation.  There are a ton of reasons not to want to have kids that early:  missing out on your young life, not getting financially set before starting a family, spending time with your husband/wife enjoying your youth without the responsibilities of children, the stress it puts on both parents when they are probably the least ready to handle it and the list could go on and on.  She definitely wasn't very tactful in how she said it and she has paid the price.  It was fine to be angry, but you are ruining your husband's relationship with his family because she hurt your feelings.  YTA", "YTA \n\nHave you tried to have a conversation with her since you\u2019re both adults now? Have you been able to really express how you felt from that past exchange? I think maybe it\u2019s time for you two to go out and just have a one on one conversation to get it all out on the table. It\u2019s easier to hold a grudge than it is to forgive. It\u2019s time to move on for the sake of everyone. You don\u2019t have to be besties but you two definitely need a chance to clear the air.", "YTA... you are petty and I suspect maybe a little jealous of her.  Get over it.  Stop making family drama over something a 16 year old girl said.  Do you always need to be the center of attention?", "OMG  it was 10 years ago?  And SIL  was 17?\nYTA  get over it.  I don't blame BIL fir not going if his wife is not invited", "YTA. For god's sake- you're still holding a petty grudge after a decade?

Are you having fun making sure this girl is cut out of family events and alienated from the family she married into because of one unkind comment she made as a teenager?  According to your post, she apologized that very night, after you both said some nasty things to each other.  She invited you to her wedding.  How much more punishment do you need to pile onto her?  You\u2019re a mother of three and you still can\u2019t forgive a comment from 10 years ago.  Grow up.  YTA.", "YTA.  Her biggest fear as a teenager was being pregnant and unmarried.  Guess what?  That's most teenagers biggest fear, if they are having sex.  She told the truth.  Maybe you didn't like hearing it.  She also apologized.  Get over it.  It has been over a decade.  If my husband was invited with be to a wedding he would not go.  And my children would never be around the couple either.", "INFO\n\nIt's often said that you stop aging mentally at whatever age you experienced trauma. Having an unplanned child at a young age is pretty traumatizing even if everyone goes right.\n\nDo you think having such an extreme reaction to the words of a stupid teenager and holding it against them 10 years later is a mature response? Do you think you're projecting your own trauma onto the situation and holding it against your SIL rather than accepting that she was a stupid kid and your feelings at the time were not her fault?\n\nYour child is now a teenager. If she said something horribly offensive to you regarding your status as a teen mom, would you hold it against her forever? Your teen is 14. SIL was 16/17. Do you believe your child is capable of making only rational and mature statements and never saying something stupid? Or would you give her grace when she sticks her foot in her mouth?", "YTA\n\nIt was 10 years ago! Surely it was enough time for her to revise her views on you all. You still continue to torment her after all this time for a dumb comment? How petty can you be? Which, by the way, is a very real fear for a girl her age. The way your lives unfolded, while you made the most of it, is objectively suboptimal for a young girl with ambition, however hurtful it was to hear.\nYou've gotta let that sh*t go!", "YTA and I feel sorry for not only Laura but your children\u2026 imagine having you as a mother, are you going to hold a decade long grudge against them as well if they say something that upsets you?\n\nI can\u2019t tell you not to have children because that\u2019s to late but I can say you shouldn\u2019t get married, you aren\u2019t mature enough to raise kids.. let alone get married.\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade, time to grow the hell up and move on and stop being so mean and petty towards Laura.

I hold a grudge better than most people, but this is an overreaction.  Tolerate her presence for a few hours.  If she were overall an abusive, toxic person, I'd get it, but it sounds like you've just decided to be miserable to her because she hurt your feelings once.  You're both adults now.  Move on.", "Who wants to be a pregnant unmarried teen right out of high school?? NOBODY that's who. \n\nSure she should have kept it to herself but shes allowed an opinion, and she's allowed NOT  to want to end up in that situation. Sure, she could've just...not said it but...oh well. You ALSO said hurtful stuff, I find it funny that you gloss over what you said, i have a feeling it was much much worse than what she said.\n\nI also suspect you're bitter and jealous. Funny isn't it, that she's an in  law, and has been for years and you're just a gf. Finally getting married after 15 years and three kids. Sounds like you're holding onto the grudge because of how long it took your man to *finally* want to marry you. Sound like you're pissed because bil saw her worth pretty early on yet your man didn't see yours.\n\nThis seems like the last straw. Your bil is done with you and your nasty jealous vindictive attitude.  He's also done with his family as well it seems so congrats. You finally succeeded in destroying the family. All because you're jealous that she's a wife and you're nothing but a gf. \n\nYour poor children, they're gonna get in an argument with you and say the dumb shit teens say and you're gonna hold it against them until you're old and gray. \n\nYTA, your fiance is an asshole and your in laws who allowed you to be and stay on this power trip are also assholes. I hope your bil tells everyone about it and NOBODY shows up to your \"wedding\"", "YTA. First she was an asshole, then you took a turn. Some number of years ago, she truly hurt you. Your feelings are valid. Maybe her apology was insufficient.

It may be hard, but not even remotely impossible. It will be worth the effort. Good luck.", "She really thinks her actions are justified! I am flabbergasted at the amount of crazy I read on here. Just gobsmacked at how some people think they are owed so much by others! God help us!", "YTA - what she said was insensitive but also true, nobody actively wants to have an accidental pregnancy in highschool and have to rearrange their entire life plans. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t regret the way your life has turned out now and you have a beautiful family to be thankful for because of it, but your SIL was a 17 year old child who poorly worded a very normal fear. \n\nShe is apart of the family you are marrying into whether you like it or not, and you need to respect that. You\u2019re acting very immature and are driving a wedge in your new family for nothing, it\u2019s awful.", "YTA. Was what she said hurtful? Yes, absolutely. She was also a teenager, very narrow-minded in her view of the world. Do you know why she might have held that view? Did you ever try to talk to her about it and make her understand your side of things? Have you talked to her about the incident since to show her why that hurt you? She apologized. You are both grown women and guaranteed she has learned from this mistake and regrets it. Do better, OP", "YTA you are using your wedding as a dig to reopen issues cause reasons. Why are you being dramatic? You said you're family has finally managed to mend itself so your kids have a good relationship with their cousins/uncle. And you're shitting on that.", "YTA. You need to get past this for yourself not necessarily for anyone else. Work with a therapist to understand why you\u2019re unable to let go of something a 17 year old kid said, a decade ago.

We have 3 kids \"Ashley\" (f14), \"Nick\" (m11) and \"Carter\" (m3).  Ashley was born  after we finished school, I got pregnant a very short time before graduation. Because of that a lot of our plans changed, we couldn't go to college since we wouldn't be able to make it and being parents at the same time. He got a good job, I kept my old job (retail) until I physically couldn't do it anymore to save more money and eventually we were able to rent a small house. However, we didn't got married, for starters because I didn't want to walk down the aisle pregnant, finances are a big reason too and also because we didn't want people gossiping and saying we only got married because I was pregnant. \n\nThen time happened, we had our daughter and being parents/ working took all of our time, then we had more kids and so on.\n\nMy fiance has a brother (m29), when he was 18 he started dating my SIL \"Laura\" (f27). At first we liked her, however me and her had an argument around a year after they started dating which made the whole family dislike her. She told me her worst fear was ending up like me, having kids right after HS while being unmarried. I felt like shit. I told her some hurtful stuff, I admit that, but I would've never told her so if she would've kept her mouth shut. We were having dinner over at my in laws house and my fiance's parents got very angry at her too and asked her to apologize and leave, which she did. \n\nBIL and SIL got married some years after but our relationship never recovered from that argument. I try to avoid her every time I can. We were invited to their wedding and BIL basically begged us to go for him, so I reluctantly did. Over these last years BILs relationship with the family has gotten better and his kids have a good relationship with the family.\n\nFiance and I are planning our wedding now. We have sent our invitations last week, we decided to exclude SIL from the wedding, we sent a invitation for BIL and their kids, but not her. BIL called my husband and asked why wasn't his wife's name in the invitation, he explained why and BIL got angry, he told us we can't keep pretending that his wife doesn't exist because it's unfair, we have already made her miss many family events just to be \"petty\". Husband told him it's our wedding and we can invite whoever we want, also we want people who will celebrate our love with us, not people who think as bad of us as his wife does. \n\nBIL is now threatening to not come to the wedding, which has upset my in laws because he also doesn't want to send the kids with them so at least they will be able to come.

NO but I think she has more than been punished. \n\nSo take the high road and invite her. You don\u2019t have to be her bff. You don\u2019t have to talk to her daily.

Or well, maybe not and you come here in 20 years Like \"my daughter wants to come to my birthday party but she told me something hurtful 15 years ago AITA for not wanting her there\"", "FFS. I seriously doubt there is anyone woman out there who \"wants\" to be pregnant and single right after high school. It hurt your feelings, but that is reality.\n\nShe apologized for it. Then for 10 whole years you have not let her forget about it. IF she didn't apologize I could see why you would treat her this way. She had apologized tried to make amends, but you are still being a huge AH about it. Fucking let it go.", "And she apologized. YTA. A real big one to hold on to a grudge for so long", "And you said hurtful stuff back that you glossed over in this post. YTA. It\u2019s time to grow up.", "I've read your post and comments. You and your STBH need to grow up,and if your in laws are still holding on to what a 16/17 year old girl said a decade ago,they need to grow up as well. In fact if your in laws are still holding a grudge and hating your SIL,then BIL/SIL need to go no contact,including keeping their children away from all of you. Don't like a parent without a good reason(this is not),you don't get to be around children who hold half of said parents DNA. \n\nBTW, I too was a teen mom,but I emotionally grew up,try it.", "You're immature as fuck. Don't even get married", "She was barely older than your kid is now.", "YTA- have you never said something dumb or that you regret as a teenager? Teenagers say dumb stuff all the time- they are kids. Holding on to this for over a decade and still punishing her is ridiculous. Grow up.", "I can understand that making you upset at the time. But you are a grown adult and it has been years since then. Move on.", "BS all of your comments scream \"side with me or don't see your grandchildren.\" You forced this and obviously are comfortable with separating your husband from his family.", "Question: are you open to any answer other than N T A?", "My sister got pregnant young, and she readily agreed with others that if was a valid fear and told her daughters not to make the same mistake.", "Its common for teen moms to never grow up mentally. They never get to experience college, going on their own,  exploring, forming adult relationships. Im also guessing that the sil is thinner, prettier and more charismatic than op. Super common with people like op. I hope no one goes to this wedding and stops supporting this childish bullshit. I wish i could show sil this thread. She doesn't deserve this abuse", "It sounds like you are just fine with ostracizing your husband from his family, which also makes you an AH.", "Then it sounds like the in laws need to deal with it. I still think you\u2019re holding on to something a teenager said in the heat of the moment and it comes off very childish. You don\u2019t need to be her bff or anything but she I family and isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. She also extended an apology for her insensitive comment", "Is this your hill to die on? Ostracize her for life for a rude comment 10 years ago? That\u2019s just sad. I bet you sit around reminding everyone how she said that comment and hurt your feelings. You cannot be this emotionally fragile.", "Good choice  \nLife's too short and difficult as it is without factoring in family divisions. I'm sure she was clueless and inflammatory and I'm sure that you were spiteful and retaliatory but it was ten years ago and you're married to brothers. Maybe you'll never be besties but just maybe you'll be able to have a couple in your life that you can count on if you need to.", "On a comment?  but not on the original text? yeah, absolutely there is more.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yeah, someone asked and they responded. Honestly I don't believe half of the stuff OP is saying. They say in one comment that her husband's sister told her to get over it and then in another that her SIL kept making comments to im laws and said sister.\n\nSo why would husband's sister tell her to get over it if she knew ghat SIL is still making rude comments...", "This is some serious Main Character energy, girl. Like, have you ever stopped to think that while you were dealing with PPD, your perspective on things was skewed? Because that's what depression DOES? If her whole goal in life was to put you down, she never would've apologized, she NEVER would've invited you to her wedding, and she NEVER would've been so affected by being cut out of the family BECAUSE OF YOU. \n\nGet therapy, jfc", "Main Character Syndrome, much?", "Holding a grudge over some ancient bullshit that was said by a teenager is petty and pointless.", "Why did you even post on this thread if you are not going to consider what people tell you and you disagree and argue with them?   Not even considering that you could YTA?", "Yes she did feel that her biggest fear was to become an unwed teen mom. That\u2019s a good thing. She shouldn\u2019t want that", "Again she was SEVENTEEN. Teenagers are brash, and dumb, and impulsive. They do and say dumb and hurtful shit and then they grow up, unlike you.", "so why are you here if you are not going to accept the verdict?", "Or she said it because she was a stupid kid who\u2019s filter between her brain and mouth wasn\u2019t fully formed. You admitted you snapped back and that you\u2019ve excluded her from family events over the years. If she still isn\u2019t a fan of yours can you blame her for saying so? It sounds like your emotional growth has been stunted by your forced adulthood. Seek therapy. Inviting only your BIL and the kids make you and your husband huge AH.", "So you agree that even you didn't want to end up like yourself.  So she was right. You're blaming her for your reckless behavior. Also,  sounds like she's more attractive, fit and charismatic and that's likely your biggest issue. You think you get to bully her when all you're doing is giving your boyfriend no choice but to cut you out before you ruin his relationships. You're never going to be invited to any event after this.  Not a single one. And you'll deserve it. Hopefully your bf can dump you before the wedding.  \n\nAlso,  i would never want to end up like you either.  You still act like a fucking teenager.  That's why people are so against teen pregnancy. You will be stunted mentally as a teen forever since you never got to live life as an adult. She apologized. You decided to act like a 12 year old and try to turn the whole family into your flying monkeys. You're mad they're saying no to you. I hope no one shows up to that wedding (including the groom)", "\"She *felt* that way\"\n\nKey word here: felt\n\nTimes and people change. Have you ever asked if she *still* feels that way?\n\nAlso, she was 17. Do you expect that she considered PPD and mental health? She was *17* and had almost no life experiences behind her.\n\nYou need to let it goooooooi", "Of course she felt that, The minority wants to get pregnant right after high school. And she is not wrong for feeling that.", "Are you here to hear different positions than your own or just to argue with people that disagree with you? Oh also YTA", "Well it is a mistake. Imagine if everyone crucified you for the dumb shit you did as a teenager. Like I dunno, getting pregnant by not using protection. You were plenty old enough to understand protection but we\u2019re too dumb to do it. Do you see how you are no better than her?", "This is childish and irrational. You need therapy.", "Listen. Everyone here is saying you\u2019re wrong. You can defend yourself all day but no one agrees. Now what? You asked here to see if you were the AH and everyone is saying yes.", "You still went though\u2026", "You lack foresight and the ability to reflect on yourself. Put yourself in her shoes for five seconds. She made one small mistake, and you\u2019ve repeatedly tormented her and treated her like shit for years. One mistake does not give you the right to act like a brat. Grow up.", "You sound like you stopped maturing back when you got pregnant with your first child. This is some arrested development, immature behavior.", "And yet you are not better by insulting her right back. But you were an adult while she wasnt. You can expect immaturity from a Teenager but you shouldnt expect an adult to level down to the immaturity level of a Teenager Just because they told you their truth (and frankly the majority fears becoming a teen mum right after high school). You are one of the people you seem to despise. And she even apologized, you went to their wedding and made it seem like everything is fine just to be more immature Then she was and holding a grudge over something like that", "I mean can you at least prepare your oldest that the first time they mouth off will be the last because you clearly never forget, and are willing to put lots of energy into holding a grudge against a teenager for saying something poorly worded.", "You can still love someone and not want to make the same choices as them.", "Was this the only hurtful thing she's said to you? Or has their been other instances?", "So if one of your kids said something hurtful to you in their teenage years you will cut them off? You will throw them out and never talk to them again?", "She doesn\u2019t say hurtful things. She made one comment ten years ago that you (admitted by you)retaliated and said hurtful things back. YTA", "I wouldn't want people around me that say hurtful things habitually, but just once? Shit happens. Get over it. She made one comment, and apologized for it.", "Instead of arguing, why aren\u2019t you taking these comments to heart and growing? It seems like you want to stay a petty 18 year old.", "You weren't married. so you were single.", "Most people don't want to be pregnant straight out of high school regardless of relationship status.", "Were you married?  Nope, you were single.  A pregnant teen with no career, can\u2019t for the life of me see why anyone would be scared of becoming a single pregnant teen /s\n\nYou really need to grow up.", "That can change.  And it sounds from your post like it is starting to change.", "They sided with you because you were the mother of their grandchildren and she was just a girlfriend. You said hurtful and shitty things to her too.\n\nHowever she is not just the girlfriend anymore and I bet your in laws don't hold the same grudge and want a relationship with all of their grandchildren.\n\nYour in laws are upset, you said it yourself. They don't think that you are right. They are actually on your SIL side this time.", "You're about to be included in zero family events. Meaning your kids won't get a relationship with their family now. if he even still marries you (15 years and no ring?  He's been keeping his options open and having his fun) prepare for less guests than you expected.", "Probably to keep the peace. But this is the same woman who admits she is excluding SIL anyway from family gatherings. There is no way she doesn't make rude comments about this SIL.", "It seems her perspective is still skewed. She refuses to acknowledge that people can grow and mature because she and her husband never did. YTA OP and so are the people around you for going along with this behaviour.", "Sounds like bpd more than ppd", "[removed]", "I was awful at 17.

Holding a grudge this long over something so petty? How embarrassing", "[removed]", "This statement is so flawed. By this logic both myself & my partner who have been together for 15 years, share a home, finances & a child are really still single? How does our 15 years of love & commitment to each other not count because we decided to not throw an expensive party & get matching jewellery? Just because someone isn't married doesn't mean they're single.", "[removed]", "I feel sorry for your children. You are so emotionally stunted. I hope you seek therapy.", "And you expected a 17 yr old to just understand PPD or even know you have it?\n\nYou are incredibly self-centered.

Stop arguing w/ people and do some reflection.", "Okay but you had known her for a year, and unless she immediately moved into your brother in law's house, she probably only met you a couple dozen times in that year. Which means she probably didn't REALLY know you, or how fragile you were. Like my god lady, you were expecting a TEENAGER to walk on eggshells for a lady she barely knew? GET THERAPY.", "Depression isn\u2019t an excuse to censor everyone around you. You are responsible for your mental illness and it sounds like you never went to therapy which is probably why you can\u2019t grasp a sense of responsibility for your actions.", "Because she was an actual child whose brain wasn't fully formed yet.

Your partner could leave you today and you wouldn't have any of the protections that a married couple would have.\n\nIn fact in some places you wouldn't even be able to make medical decisions for your partner because you aren't married.\n\nMarriage is a legal construct.

I have seen multiple marriages that should have ended years ago but the couple stay together because \"they're married\" even if they're both miserable. Now I know that's not the case for everyone (divorce rates all over the world show it), but I do like that nothing is keeping us together other than the fact we want to be.\n\nAny medical decisions would be made by either me & her parents or her & my parents (if its regarding me). Though when I had a short stay in hospital a couple of years ago (not Covid related but it was during the height of the pandemic) & was filling out forms I had to complete a section for contact info for a long term partner/spouse because (at least here) they are treaded as the same thing in that regard.\n\nMaybe it's more of an American thing where such importance is placed on marriage, where I am it's not really seen as that big a deal. Some couples go in for it & others don't, the party is nice but other than that not many folks here make a big deal of it outside of the event itself.\n\nBut yeah, the only issue I have is that you said if you're not married then you're single. Which is simply not true. That was what I was pointing out & I don't really think I confused that issue here.\n\n\nAlso, not trying to say the OP wasn't being petty by holding onto that grudge for so long & it is something that should have been talked through by now given how long ago it was.", "[removed]", "I'm emotionally developed enough not to let it affect me for 10 years. \n\nHonestly, from one mother to another, get a grip.
