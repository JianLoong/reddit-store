I have no problems with that and they've been doing it for years and years.  Maybe once or twice a month, again, no problem.\n\nHer Mom has always been a gambling addict and it cause the divorce of her first husband and she wiped out her second husbands bank account within a couple years.  So I've always been a bit leery on the whole gambling thing. I've seen it destroy families.   (her mom lives with us now)\n\n(15yrs ago) I worked out of town/state a lot so she's always had control of our join banking account.  My checks were auto-deposit so never really broke down our bills as I should have.   After I kept pressuring her to tell me where all our money was going she broke down and told me she gambled it away at the casino.  Slot machines.  Big fight.\n\nAt that point I got a separate checking account so at least the bills would be paid on time.  I make a bit more than she does but I pay most of the bills and am still able to save up money every month.   This has never been sustainable though since any surprise bills (we have 2 teen kids) it's always me that pays for them.    She is broke every month.\n\nWhen we were going over our tax returns it turned out she owned $6k in taxes all from the casino.   We went over the whole gambling / financial problems again and she shook my hand and promised that she would stop. \n\nFast forward a few months I bought a tracker online.  One that I could put on my tractor (I let friends borrow it and want to keep track of it in case it gets stolen)  and the kids car since they're turning 16 soon I wanted to keep track of them.\n\nI had the tracker for a few weeks and decided to try it out one day.   I threw it in the console of my wifes car just to see how the app works.  She took off with her mom before I could tell her and she texted me they were heading out shopping.     Well, they went straight to the casino instead.   I wasn't mad but was definitely concerned.\n\nI felt guilty for \"spying\" on my wife so I took it out and never said anything.    However curiosity killed the cat and I threw it back in her car a few weeks later.  This time on purpose and hidden.\n\nIt's been a couple months and they've been at the casino at least twice a week. Not the BINGO hall but the actual casino.   I confronted her again today when she asked for money for kids gymnastics.  I asked her how her gambling issue was going and she denied shes back to gambling.  I gave her many outs and she wouldn't admit it.   So I then told her about the tracker.\n\nNow she's furious that I tracked her and said threw out the D word.  \n\nSorry, this post is all over the place and I'm super nervous.   We've been together for 25+ years and I'm freaking out.

You said nothing, but it proved that she would be unfaithful by lying to you.\n\nThe second time you used the tracker would have been unwarranted, especially if the first time she actually did go shopping, as then it wasnt a test, you knew it worked - but you used it to see if she was still lying to you. And was your only real means of proof, considering her word could not be trusted.\n\nSounds to me like she now paints you as the asshole because up until now she\u2019s been able to lie her way out of things, waste your money, her money, and keep you sweet, because you\u2019ve believed her and have had no reason not to. But now she has been revealed to have been lying all along, knows your trust in her word has been broken, and knows that you will potentially come between her and her addiction - so is throwing out the \u2018Divorce\u2019 talk as less a measure of your actions, but as a means to carry on her addiction unchecked and unmonitored by yourself.\n\nYou want her to stop gambling.\n\nShe wants to lie to you and keep doing it. \n\nNow she cant lie anymore, so has to chose between you and the gambling. And it sounds like the gambling has won.\n\nMoving forward, you are limited in what you can do. But it sounds like some form of counselling could help, be it couples therapy or actually getting to the root of the problem with letting her realise that she has an addiction. And also, it sounds like your mother-in-law\u2019s gambling addiction has certainly encouraged this behaviour from your wife. \n\nIt\u2019ll depend on your family relationship - but it may be worthwhile talking to her mother about this, though it may be a case of being a lost cause by now if she\u2019s been doing it through multiple marriages and is now encouraging her daughter to go down the same path as her - she could even be encouraging it because your wife is a means of funding for her problems, you never know.\n\nEither way, decide whether you want to try make things work, whether you can trust her again, and whether you want to endure arguments/counselling before things get better. And, decide whether you want to stay if her gambling goes unchecked - 25 years is a long time, but whole lives can be ruined overnight with shitty enough odds and tactful access to a spouses money / assets.

This is why I ended with ESH.\n\n(2) Gambling is a behavioral addiction. It's considered a disease. Hiding behaviors, which she was engaging in, is a hallmark of addiction. When she had an outburst after your tracking discussion, it's likely a way of distracting from the problem behavior and minimizing the extent to which the behavior has become truly problematic in her life.

Your wife has a problem that she seems to be either unable or unwilling to deal with. As a practical matter (and as other people here have suggested), you need to check your credit and your children's credit immediately. Also, check any college funds or other accounts for your kids that she might have access to. Considering her history and her mother's history, she might have cleaned out accounts and/or taken out loans in your or your kids' names.\n\nAs for the \"D\" word, you might be at that point. Couple's counseling for the two of you and some kind of addition counseling or Gamblers Anonymous for her and her mother might at least help you all clarify where you stand and, realistically, what your options are.
