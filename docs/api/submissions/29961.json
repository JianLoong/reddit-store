I had Ethan when I was only 18 so I was a young mother. It was a tough time in my life but I made it out. When Ethan was born Jason was there right next to me. He's an amazing dad. So here's the deal...\n\nMe and Jason have been co-parating for several years. And it's an amazing schedule. We have it so I have Ethan one week and Jason has him another. We live In the same area so Ethan goes to the same school. Now Jason makes way more then me. He has a stable job and he owns his own home etc. But I am working three jobs and still struggle to make ends meet but i always pull through. Recently Ethan had been coming to my house in a bad and disrespectful mood. Saying how he wants to go back to his dad's and how he hates being here. I live in a one bedroom apartment so I can get why he might like it better there. But his attitude was a shock to me. I had a talk to him about his actions and attitude and he told me that he hated it here because its small and theres nothing to do, i got mad at him and i grounded him. I had raised his to be better so I have no idea were this is coming from. This had been going on for weeks. Where he would come back to my home and disrespect me. I had multiple talks with him and his father about his behavior. And I couldn't put up with it anymore \n\nI talked with jason one weeked about just giving Ethan to him full time. And he got very mad at me he started screaming at me and calling me a \"bad mother\" and that i have no right to just do that to him. I screamed right back at him, i told him how i didnt want him in the first place and he would be better off with him because I couldn't give Ethan the life he wants. Jason told me if I really wanted to do that to Ethan then fine but if I wanted contact with Ethan in the future that I couldn't. So here i am waiting to see my son for the last time before i give him up. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I just want my son to have a better life and to grow up in a nice home. And I know that I won't be able to give that to him.

You got a kid starting puberty, a few weeks of a bad mood, grounding your kid for telling you how he feels and now you\u2019re just abandoning him. You could have suggested that Ethan live with his dad during the week and spend weekends with you, instead you jump to signing over your rights. Then you have nerve to tell his father that you never wanted your kid to begin with, after 13 years. You\u2019re a real piece of work", "After thirteen years, you really think this is a good idea? How about family therapy? How about teaching him that money isn't the prime factor to being happy? You are upset atm, I can't believe you really mean this.", "YTA children\u2019s preference isn\u2019t strictly based on material items. My daughters father can eat out every night and live in a big house in a fancy town. But her and play and talk and dance and dream and wander and wonder and play and more play. We are tight. She likes it here better. She doesn\u2019t have her own bathroom here or a pool, but she has support and love. She even told me she appreciates my car because \u201cmost people don\u2019t appreciate small things like when their windows roll up or the heater works, but we do and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t want a new car, I love this car.\u201d You don\u2019t want the kid, then give him up, but either way YTA", "YTA for grounding and then abandoning your teenage child just because he wanted to live with his father due to the fact his father has a nicer house than the one bedroom you currently live in.", "YTA\n\nAbandoning your son and admitting \"I never wanted him\".... Gee.... I wonder.", "he is 13 of course he wants privacy and that is impossible in a one bed appartment. It sucks that women have to work 3 jobs and it is still not enough .  I don't know why you had to give your parental rights away . you could simple agree that he is old enough to tell his dad where he wants to stay and if he wants to stay the majority with him it's fine but he can always come visit . Of course it sucks coming from a home where you have everything you need to one where you have to share a room with your mom like did you have the beds in the same room ? is he sleeping on the couch ?", "YTA. The fact that you are jumping to this because you can\u2019t cope with a teenager being moody and disrespectful (which even rich teenagers occasionally do, because they\u2019re *teenagers*, but yours genuinely has a point, I can\u2019t imagine being a teen boy sharing a one bedroom apartment with my mom and you grounded him for sharing a valid opinion) is beyond problematic. For the sake of your son, seek therapy and read any parenting book (I highly recommend How to Talk so Teens will Listen).", "Why yes, YTA and a colossal one at that.  I went through something very similar.  Ex and I had every other week, ex makes significantly more money, has gorgeously furnished 4 bedroom home with tons of stuff to do within biking distance while I lived in a tiny place without much.  My kids we\u2019re about the same age as yours when we split.  You know what never crossed my mind?  Abandoning my children!   I am just absolutely horrified that this is the conclusion you came to.  But I guess if you are willing to literally give up your child when the going gets tough maybe he\u2019s better off learning to live without you sooner rather than later.", "YTA for jumping to an extreme decision too soon.\n\nYour son is going through his teenage rebellious phase which has been hard on you. It seems to me that you could have taken a break from each other without going to this extreme.\n\nThis is isn't really about him having a good life or a nice home, as he can live with his dad most of the time and have those. Surely having a relationship with his mother is part of having a good life anyway *as long as* that relationship isn't toxic.\n\nWhat you have to work out within yourself is if you really want to sever the relationship because you don't want him and the rebellious phase has brought that out and you truly want to be done, or whether you are catastrophizing and choosing an extreme solution when the real solution would be to cut down on having him over at your house until his rebellious phase is over, while letting him know that you still love him and he's welcome to come over or see you when he wants to -- you won't force him, but the door's open.\n\nIt seems to me that the less extreme solution is the better one -- unless the fact is that what this is really about is you wanting to be done with a child you never wanted.", "YTA.\n\nTall to your son and ask him how you could make it more fun for him when he comes to visit. You have done this for 13 years and want to give up now? What message will you be giving your son?", "OP sounds exhausted in every way a human can be exhausted. Burnt out and deeply wounded. I understand that. OP, you need a long break (maybe do every second weekend until you\u2019re ready to start again) and a sh#t ton of support. Motherhood doesn\u2019t automatically confer the ability to endure the unendurable for the rest of your life. Tenderness is a luxury beyond the reach of those whose every internal resource is utterly depleted. \n\nChild support is meant to level the playing field as much as is reasonable for the child and the parents. Why is the father able to afford the lifestyle described while OP is drowning?\n\nQuestion: OP, is your son\u2019s father contributing appropriately? If not, go to (or go back to) court and get this sorted out. You can\u2019t be the mom your boy deserves, the mom you are capable of being, if your life is an unrelenting sh#tstorm. When you are stable and supported, I wish you both so much joy in your love for each other. It\u2019ll be so different then - and beautiful. I promise. \n\nNAH, only an exhausted, lonely mom who\u2019s lost all hope.", "NAH . I Think you have made a rash decision due to some financial guilt and depression around the tension in the relationship with your son.

You would regret it for the rest of your life.", "YTA\nYou have a 13 year old child. You haven't provided his own space in your home, though he's there half of every month. He's becoming vocal about the lack of regard for his privacy and comfort at your home. Your reaction is to punish, reject and abandon him.\n\nYou seem completely self absorbed. You treat your child as an unfortunate responsibility and inconvenience. Your housing choice reflects your thinking only of yourself, and not a family unit where your son is \"part of the family.\" You aren't willing to hold a safe space for your child in your home nor in your heart.", "OP has a problem, but it is not her son.  Her problem is not her son or his dad or the three jobs or the one-bedroom apartment, her problem is herself.  How could she love her son, she doesn't even love herself.  She obviously needs therapy.

Didn\u2019t want him in the first place. Omg.. who says that?? That poor kid. He\u2019s going to need so much therapy because of you. You are abandoning your child!! It\u2019s not like he\u2019s an infant who won\u2019t remember you. He\u2019s going to know everyday that you left him because you didn\u2019t want him. He\u2019s going to hate you forever.

Your poor child, he has a very shitty coward of a mother. He came out of your body, how can you even stand to be away from him when it's his dad's week? I crave having my son near me and I dread the day he leaves home... I have a difficult child and I've dealt with some horrible depression and awful poverty and the terrible feeling that I'm not providing an affluent enough lifestyle, but like, my body would literally not tolerate separation from him. I don't say that to suggest I'm better than you, only to suggest you may need therapy because that lack of attachment and interest is not normal. His father is right, if you really give your own flesh and blood away then you don't deserve to ever have contact with him again.
