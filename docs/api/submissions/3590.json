The parents  or  T and V?", "NTA. They are complaining cause they can't take things anymore.", "NTA. Your parents even agree that you have a lock.", "NTA. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll decide all this \"drama\" is too much and they have to move. Especially if they think you set up a camera pointing at your door streaming to your phone.", "NTA  \n\n\nIf they weren't stealing in your room, why would they be complaining you are locking it? No one should be complaining about others wanting some privacy...", "This! Nta", "This is horrible TV.", "Thing is I confront both with \u201chave you guys seen this \u201c while they both deny. At this point they are like a tag team", "So good. No one cares about locks unless its keeping them from something they want.", "NTA. If they aren't stealing then they shouldn't even notice your door is locked. Very easy to point out. Good luck with crappy fam, OP.", "Thanks for the  good luck ima need it", "NTA. They're complaining because you took away their free-shit ATM. Their \"need 20 bucks? Go steal that shit!\" Free pass. They are shitty people. I wouldn't be surprised if they started stealing from your parents, if they weren't already.\n\nThey sound really manipulative on top of the thieving and that they were likely in a toxic place prior to this or that the previous place didn't allow their BS.\n\nI'm sorry you're stuck in this situation. It's hard when family turn out to be really crappy people. It's even harder to disown them. Hopefully, by the time you're ready and able to make that decision, they'll have cleaned up their acts and are on the path to being decent humans. Good luck.", "Thieves hate this one trick....", "NTA - they are just validating your decision.", "NTA\nThey prefer you leave your stuff so it\u2019s easier to steal?", "NTA. If they\u2019re not trying to get into your room, it shouldn\u2019t affect them at all. It\u2019s not dramatic at all to want a door that locks even if people aren\u2019t stealing from you. If you lock it while you\u2019re in it tho and trust your parents ability to keep a spare key away from T and V, I would give them one for emergencies. Just in case there was a fire or you like fell and hurt yourself.", "NTA. I went through this same issue with my sister\u2026 WHEN WE WERE 12 and 15!! Your sister is a thief. She broke your trust and a big boundary. Don\u2019t even bother to think about her feelings on this issue. She doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.", "NTA\nNot dramatic either. Why would they be bothered by the lock if they weren't going in to take things?!", "Clearly NTA. Next time they complain , ask them why does it matter to them that you have a lock on your door?", "NTA\n\nWhile they are family they are still GUESTS in your home. They are being extremely disrespectful to you.\n\nYou are not obligated to sharw anything of yours. They are rude for stealing from a relative. You have a right to lock up your safe space.", "Call them out. \n\n\u201cWhat do you think you need from my room?\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA. You live with thieves. Lock is the logical solution. Have a blunt discussion about possessions and boundaries with both of them. Your stuff is yours and they need to ASK before they take ANYTHING.", "Complaining about the lock is how the self incriminate lmao. Why would yoh care what i do with my door unless you go in there when im not around?", "I keep my beauty products in a safe in the bathroom because my daughters use them if I don\u2019t. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they wouldn't try to go into yor room to steal things, they wouldn't even realize there is a lock.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are complaining because you\u2019re forcing them to confront the fact that their family isn\u2019t perfect and their grandkid is a thief. Or if it\u2019s V complaining, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t steal your shit anymore and are offended by your refusal to pretend they don\u2019t.", "NTA.  Your sister and her kid don't undersand boundries nor do the respect them.  Your parents gave you permission to install the lock so you have nothing to apologize for.\n\nThe fact that they are complaining about your lock tells me that it was very much needed and probably the only way to get them to respect your boundries, privacy and your possessions.", "NTA. Shit, I ended up putting a keyed lock on my door while i was still in Jr high through community college and loving at home because my brother (6 years younger) would walk in and \"borrow\" shit without asking. My folks were totally behind it too, that's how often it happened. That was just Innocent childhood sibling annoyance at the time.\n\nA grown ass adult with a kid and they BOTH steal, and money was involved (my issue was just shit like games and cds)!?  HELL NO. If anything they should be forces to return your stuff, reimburse the money and kicked the fuck out.", "NTA. They're lucky you don't put them on blast on social media, or report them to the police for the crimes they've committed. Maybe you could come up with an invoice; a list of everything they owe you and everything that was stolen and say that you might remove the lock as long as they pay you back. Otherwise you'll have no choice but to go to small claims court and/or the police to recover your funds. You have so much leverage over them and they're acting like somehow they are untouchable.", "NTA\n\nI mean litrally put a camera in ur room and let them steal one more and then show them rec when they deny next time. Lock in good solution but do lock ur closets and drawera too.\n\nI mean really stealing frm same house??\n\nLike Mother Like Kid", "NTA. If they weren't stealing your stuff and going into your room then the lock shouldn't affect them", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA Just agree with them - tell them you love the drama of coming home to your room and finding everything exactly as you left it.", "The only people who have a say in installing a lock on the OP\u2019s door are the OP and the homeowners (parents). As long as they all agree, it\u2019s moot point. The sister and her kid have no need to access the OP\u2019s room.", "No you just deprived the thieves of their targets. Keep it locked.", "So what's their problem? Are they complaining they can't get into your room? That you don't trust them? Let them know of course you don't trust them because they keep stealing your possessions. NTA.", "NTA  ideally they shouldn't even notice the lock as they have no reason to be in that room.  Sure makes it \ud83d\udcaf clear they are thieves.", "NTA. Keep the lock on and when they complain you are being \u201cdramatic \u201c (seriously what does that mean? That you have strong feelings about someone? Why wouldn\u2019t you have strong feelings about your privacy?) just laugh and say \u201cyeah just like you are being dramatic about something that has nothing to do with you \u201c.", "NTA\n\nSay you won't lock it as a show of trust.\n\nThen, when they try to open your door and get caught....maybe they'll take the hint that you're not okay with being constantly robbed.\n\nScrap that. They'd find a way to say it's all your fault anyway.\n\nI can see why their situation hasn't resolved and still living with your parents", ". Good for you.", "OP's sister is a rather cynical person lol NTA", "I really don't get why OP is confused about this at all. Someone is crossing obvious boundaries, you take steps to enforce those boundaries, why would you care if they are unhappy about those boundaries being enforced?", "THIS. OP, I wouldn't think twice about this. You needed a lock, your parents agreed and now its on your door.  Ignore sis and kid. You're absolutely NTA", "Or need anything from in there, none of your stuff is in there so why are you upset over my having a door with a lock and key?", "T and v complained about", "This my favorite comment right here and yeah they have stolen from my parents my moms dress and prior I heard T stole my moms card. Worst part is my parents don\u2019t address because they avoid conflict and t is the favorite. Weird part is she\u2019s over 29", "Mom's a big fat L of a parent.", "Nta.  They are bitching  cause they can't steal from you now.\n\nI had to do the same thing when my aunt moved into our house. She was coming in my room and constantly taking a perfume that her sister had gave me that was expensive endowsing herself in it\n\n\nI put a regular key lock on my door and then gave a copy of the key to my parents. I would not put the cheap one that just requires a screwdriver", "Oof, I'm really sorry for you, and a little bit for your parents. Their folks never taught them is OK to demand respect for your boundaries, even a little bit. That's pretty sad. But, you're seeming to be made of stronger stuff, and that's wonderful. Stick with this boundary like it's an act in the Constitution, and it'll take years and an act of congress to change. If you have a car, hide your keys and your spare key. You'll also want to be very good about never leaving your room key around. Folks like your sister and nibling will find a map to it, track it across miles of wasteland, get the key, track back across the wasteland to steal from your room, and then be dumbstruck that you're upset about it."]}
