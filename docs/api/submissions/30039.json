{"id": 30039, "submission_id": "17kkd03", "title": "AITA for telling the lady at the pet shelter that she is actively hurting adoption chances?", "selftext": "I (24F) have been trying to adopt a cat for a while from this local shelter. I'm not new to owning cats; I've always been surrounded by them growing up so when I moved away from my family home; I knew I wasn't going to be taking the cats with me because they had bonded to my parents, the house, the dog, and they were technically my dad's babies so that would just be cruel to seperate them. \n\nI moved a couple hours from home to be closer to the college I'm attending and I am really homesick. Like many, I deal with anxiety and depression and it feels very heavy lately, even with my partner living with me. I always feel better when I'm around animals and my partner and I are big cat lovers, so we decided to look at a shelter that specializes in senior cats for one to adopt.\n\nI never get any positive answer back,, so I decided to go in person and ask the lady in charge of accepting or refusing applications if there was something more I could add to the applications in the future that would higher my chances of being accepted since the shelter is at max capacity, but we keep getting rejected.\n\n She pointed to the part on the form that asked; \"What would make you give up a pet?\" And said my answer was the problem. My answer was; \"The only reason I would ever give up a pet is if I were to die and nobody in out of my friends or family could take it in. I would never voluntarily give up my pet.\" \n\nI was confused by what the problem was to that question and she answered that I am not responsible enough if I don't have an immediate backup person to take the pet if I die. I was baffled because I have my partner and my parents who would take my pet in if I died and in this scenario; I painted an extreme situation to say; I would never willingly give a pet away. \n\nI explained this to the lady and pointed out that that she was being a little nitpicky on this one, but she insisted that if I was a good candidate; I would have a better plan than let my family or friends house the cat in a case of death.\n\nI was feeling really upset by the way she was speaking to me and the attitude so I told her; \"You know, if you weren't being so unreasonable, maybe the shelter wouldn't be so packed right now. Yes animals need good homes and it should be monitored; but you are actively harming the chances of them being adopted into homes. They are already in the later stages of life, don't they deserve to live as many days possible in a warm home instead of a cage?\"\n\nThis is what may have made me an asshole because the lady started crying and called her coworker over to escort us out; telling her coworker that we said she was making sure the cats died alone. I wasn't intending to make her feel that way, I was just trying to point out a flaw in the choice processes.\n\nThe shelter lady said we were not welcome to adopt as we are AH's. I'm uncertain and feel really confused by it all. My fiance says that they are extremely fishy and I shouldn't let their dramatics get to me. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I've been getting some people asking; the first part of the form has emergency contacts for people that would take the cat in case of emergencies. That is why it is written the way it was. My adoption application included Vet references and an official letter from the company I rent with signed and stamped that they would not be changing any pet policies and that cats could be kept in the building.", "created_utc": 1698756861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kkd03/aita_for_telling_the_lady_at_the_pet_shelter_that/", "score": 4676, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is making perfect (her definition of it) be the enemy of good.", "Not a comment on whether it is right or not, but just the fact that you are a college student may be a reason the shelter turned you down. Many rescues will not adopt to students as most students are transient, maybe you'll end up in an apartment that doesn't allow pets and then the pet ends right back at the shelter.\n\nI'm not commenting whether this is right or not, but it is fairly common.\n\nWhen my husband and I adopted our two kitties I was worried I would get turned down just because, gasp, we both worked and so were out of the house a lot.", "NTA- she is way out of line.", "NTA\n\nI had several \"try to adopt a cat\" situations that ended very poorly - and a cat still at the shelter. Some shelters are so protective that they pass up good homes for stupid reasons - like yours. \n\nI have a wonderful cat I got from a good shelter with an almost zero kill rate. He's a joy, and you'll find a good one too. \n\nThere's so many cats, you shouldn't deal with jerks at the shelter.", "Nta at all. Frick, I know people who don't have concrete plans for what would happen to their kids if they died suddenly (make and update your wills people! It's important!). Not having a 12-step plan for your cat, post-death, does not make you an unfit pet owner.", "NTA. Our shelter here is super strict about applications, too. Especially about how cats need to have outdoor access. We're in a major city and I personally find that completely irresponsible because it's really dangerous. I can't understand how these people rather have the animals living in cages in the shelter than in a home where they are loved but cannot go outside. It's stupid and leads people to getting pets from less trusty sources. Also, this shelter is allegedly the largest in Europe, and constantly moaning about having no capacities. I used to donate to them for a long while but when I was looking into adoption after my old cat died I stopped because I found their criteria so unreasonable. I get wanting the best for those animals, but this bs really ain't it.", "NTA.  I had a very similar experience when trying to adopt from our local Humane Society many years ago.  They asked \"why\" I wanted to adopt a pet.  It was the first time I'd ever had to fill out an application for a pet adoption and wasn't sure how to word it that I wanted a dog, other than I wanted a dog and had always had one, couldn't imagine not having one.  I did not put down that I was looking for a guard dog, a fight dog or anything like that (nothing in the application was negative).  They still rejected me because I didn't use the phrase, \"for companionship.\"  Really?  I went to a breeder, bought a puppy and never looked back.  \n\nThe gatekeeping from some of these places is ridiculous.  Besides, if someone wanted a dog or pet for a nefarious purpose, what's to keep them from lying on the application?  I understand being cautious, but your application sounded just fine.  The fact that you applied many times with no reply is incredibly rude.  It doesn't sound to me like they actually want to connect the cats with new families.", "NTA.\n\nI commend you for wanting to adopt a senior cat.  You're right - senior cats deserve to spend as much time as possible in a loving home, and not in a shelter.\n\nI have plans for what happens to my pets should my husband and I die.  I hope that my friends and family will follow my wishes, but there's no guaranty that will happen.  And a lot of things can change that would affect what situation would be best for my pets when I'm gone.  I thought your answer to the question about giving up your pets was honest and reasonable.\n\nI think it's possible they didn't want you to adopt because of your age and the fact you are in college.  I ran into this when I was in college and wanted to adopt a cat.  I was considered too young and unstable, and wouldn't have the money to care for a pet. I was told that to my face.  I wound up going to another rescue organization to adopt, and I think you are going to need to do the same.\n\nGood luck finding a feline companion!", "I'm not sure where you live but Petco and PetSmart also adopt out cats.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re overthinking the question though. They want to make sure you have someone who will take the pet should anything happen to you. All they need to know is that you have family or a support network around you who would take the cat in. You don\u2019t need to say anything about if you die or anything like that. Keep it straightforward and to the point.", "As someone who has adopted a few cats in my day I'll say that it's not wildly uncommon to find people who run shelters to be a little bit unhinged. This woman is nuts if your answer isn't acceptable. NTA. There are plenty of good places to adopt cats from. Highly recommend you visit your city/area subreddit and ask for good recommendations on where to adopt", "NTA, I got a similar runaround from local rescue groups when I wanted a companion for my cat. Apparently, I answered the \u201cWho are you getting this cat for?\u201d question wrong.\n\nFortunately, I found a good samaritan who had tamed and fixed the kittens of a feral mother and she let me meet them and adopt one. There are good people in the rescue community but the Soup Nazi \u201cNo pet for you!\u201d types are a real problem. I realize we need some rules but the arbitrary refusals just push people away from rescuing. Wouldn\u2019t \u201cCan we help you craft a contingency plan? Here is an example\u201d be more constructive?", "NTA. I know I'm going against the tide of other comments but I think that was an unnecessary answer you put on the form. You didn't even say you had backup family that could take it in if you were to pass. Just say you have never and would never surrender a pet and all the pets you've had have lived out their lives with you. The end.\n\nI understand how gatekeepy, condescending and rude some of those shelter people can be - I've experienced it myself - but it would have served you better to explain what would happen if you passed and asked if you could talk about adopting. Now you're banned, so you didn't get a good outcome and neither did the cats. \n\nEssentially this is a case of you might have been right but sometimes right doesn't get us what we want.\n\nETA: I just read that she was the director. You should consider writing a review of the shelter because she was out of line and overly emotional.", "NTA. Go to the local pound run by the county or city, you should have better luck. Rescues SUCK imo.", "NTA. You should write a public review on this shelter.  I'm guessing she probably gets public funds and donations. So the worse her situation looks, the more she profits as a non-profit.", "I was turned down because I had a recliner and the cat may get caught in it.  I told her I didn\u2019t own a recliner.  I asked why she thought I had a recliner and I can\u2019t remember what she said but she came off as she didn\u2019t believe me.  I just left and eventually adopted an awesome cat from another shelter.  It has never once gotten caught in the recliner I don\u2019t have.", "NTA. Really, what could be better for those animals than to go to your family or friends in the even of your death (as long as they have expressed willingness)? Her attitude doesn't make sense. You might have been more diplomatic in your response, by assuring her that you did have responsible people willing to care for them. If I were you, I would write to the director of the shelter and explain in a straight forward, non aggressive manner that they were turning down good applicants. \n\nSadly, there are many other shelters and you are certain to make another little one happy. It is so good of you to adopt a senior who deserves to spend their final years in a loving home.", "NTA. There are a lot of ridiculously crazy rescues. I was trying to adopt a new cat and one of them legitimately wanted copies of my house deed to prove I had ownership. A different one wanted an audit of my checking account to prove I had the finances to care for an animal. Way invasive. \n\nYou were 100% correct and she needed to be checked. There will be other rescues. I ended up finding my cat through a woman who works with feral colonies in cow country. Takes in pregnant cats when the colonies get too big for the farms, gets them through birth, spayed, and gets everyone their kitten shots and adopted out. Much, much more practical in her approach.", "NTA here, and the shelter worker totally was. Also there totally is something fishy-sounding going on there, but don't let it worry you, dude.", "Oh my GOD I had a similar problem with a rescue who nit picked a very small detail on an answer we gave. It was SO bizarre! Like no wonder they had so many unadopted cats.\n\nMeanwhile every other shelter was practically throwing their cats at us. \n\nI'm just led to believe some rescues are run by whackadoodles.\n\nNTA by the way.", "My mom was denied a Golden Retriever, because the condo they live in GOD FORBID, doesn't have a fence.  So they got one somewhere else.", "NTA, i stopped volunteering with a rescue group because of something similar. They were a great group when i started with them. They were always posting about needing foster homes because they didnt have enough.  Then some time after i started doing \"home visits\" (home tours and an interviews) i had a family reach out 2 months later asking if i had heard of anything happening with them. i was shocked the rescue had not decided in over 2 months or even communicated with them. i followed up with our coordinator on another home i had visited to find out the status and they informed me the potential adopter had went to a breeder since the group hadnt decided after a month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome groups get too focused on finding the \"BEST\" home when all they need to do is find the right home.", "[deleted]", "Some years ago I had an Italian Greyhound who I had rescued from an abusive owner. I wanted to adopt another rescue IG so Morgan had a playmate. I applied at several Italian Greyhound rescues and none would allow me to adopt one. Noone would tell me why.

Especially as it specifically can't be 'have the cat taken back to the shelter'. She's literally making an impossible riddle. The only other options I can think of are 'leave the cat everything in my will and have my executor hire professional staff to care for it' or 'return from the grave and take the cat back to the afterlife with me'. The phrases 'tinpot dictator', 'jobsworth' and 'sad person who has only this one tiny bit of power and a whole planet's worth of resentment' spring to mind.", "I\u2019ve seen this time and time again.

If they continue to treat people like this, people will buy instead!", "NTA, that wasn't even the question, you were asked what it would take to give up your pet and you just gave additional info which she, for some reason, didn't like. \n\nWas there even an actual question on that form asking you for any backup plan for the animal in the case of your early demise?\n\nIf not, she really has no case imo...", "NTA.", "That is weird for sure.  I have processed literally thousands of rescue applications.  \n\nUsually what we screen for are people who would give up the cat if it is destructive, people who are going to declaw the cat, and since we were in a big city, if they were going to let the cat be outdoors. \n\nWe would never expect someone to have a plan in case they die.  \n\nThere are a lot of weirdos in the rescue world though.  While weird, it is certainly not surprising.\n\nNta", "NTA. Find another rescue. Let's say that you did put someone's name down as a guardian in the event of your untimely demise, who's to guarantee that that person will still be able to take care of the cat?

Even the best laid plans for your pets, money, material belongings, and everything else are not guaranteed because you can't be here to oversee any of it.

If you want to, I\u2019d track one of them down and send an email. The BOD controls all and is above the shelter director you dealt with in hierarchy sake.

After an hour of no answer, we decided to take him to the shelter since we couldn't hold onto him because of having two large dogs of our own. \n\nWe got there, saw employees and volunteers working, and asked if we could leave him with them.

At this point, we tried calling other shelters that were open, but they refused to take the dog in as well due to the fact he was found in a different county. \n\nWhen we got there at 11:30, we tried asking again and they told us again that we had to wait until 12.

Hopefully the cat was happy in it's foster home, but it seems like they should do whatever they can to get pets adopted, but they don't want to do much of anything.\n\nIn the end we went back to the rescue we got another cat from.", "I used to volunteer for the local pet shelter and this  question was simply intended to prove that the intended adopter was thinking into the future and actively planning to be responsible for the animal.

I'm not new to owning cats; I've always been surrounded by them growing up so when I moved away from my family home; I knew I wasn't going to be taking the cats with me because they had bonded to my parents, the house, the dog, and they were technically my dad's babies so that would just be cruel to seperate them. \n\nI moved a couple hours from home to be closer to the college I'm attending and I am really homesick. Like many, I deal with anxiety and depression and it feels very heavy lately, even with my partner living with me. I always feel better when I'm around animals and my partner and I are big cat lovers, so we decided to look at a shelter that specializes in senior cats for one to adopt.\n\nI never get any positive answer back,, so I decided to go in person and ask the lady in charge of accepting or refusing applications if there was something more I could add to the applications in the future that would higher my chances of being accepted since the shelter is at max capacity, but we keep getting rejected.\n\n She pointed to the part on the form that asked; \"What would make you give up a pet?\" And said my answer was the problem. My answer was; \"The only reason I would ever give up a pet is if I were to die and nobody in out of my friends or family could take it in. I would never voluntarily give up my pet.\" \n\nI was confused by what the problem was to that question and she answered that I am not responsible enough if I don't have an immediate backup person to take the pet if I die. I was baffled because I have my partner and my parents who would take my pet in if I died and in this scenario; I painted an extreme situation to say; I would never willingly give a pet away. \n\nI explained this to the lady and pointed out that that she was being a little nitpicky on this one, but she insisted that if I was a good candidate; I would have a better plan than let my family or friends house the cat in a case of death.\n\nI was feeling really upset by the way she was speaking to me and the attitude so I told her; \"You know, if you weren't being so unreasonable, maybe the shelter wouldn't be so packed right now. Yes animals need good homes and it should be monitored; but you are actively harming the chances of them being adopted into homes. They are already in the later stages of life, don't they deserve to live as many days possible in a warm home instead of a cage?\"\n\nThis is what may have made me an asshole because the lady started crying and called her coworker over to escort us out; telling her coworker that we said she was making sure the cats died alone. I wasn't intending to make her feel that way, I was just trying to point out a flaw in the choice processes.\n\nThe shelter lady said we were not welcome to adopt as we are AH's. I'm uncertain and feel really confused by it all. My fiance says that they are extremely fishy and I shouldn't let their dramatics get to me. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA and you\u2019re right, this is extremely fishy behaviour. I would email someone higher up at the rescue to make sure they\u2019re aware of this woman\u2019s strange logic and how it\u2019s hurting the cats in the long run.", "That shelter seems sketch af\u2026 definitely NTA and I\u2019d report them honestly", "I think this could be as simple as a miscommunication. They don't necessarily know anything about you based on your application (e.g. age, health history), but you brought up death on your application, which is odd for someone who is presumably young and in good health. Maybe she thought that means death is an imminent possibility and that would make you a risky applicant to take in a pet.", "Nta. \n\nFrom my experience, cat adoption is really hard. I basically had a background check before I could adopt my cat. While I understand the adoption facilities need to perform their due process in order to ensure the animals don\u2019t go to abusive homes, a question such as the one you pointed out is asinine. I wish you luck in finding a better and more understanding adoption center in the future.", "Nta she\u2019s being crazy picky about that. Do you need to provide an updated will for who would take care of a senior cat in the event of your death? \n\nI was once rejected for a dog adoption because I lived too close to a park. (It\u2019s like a 10 minute walk away and I live in an area where there are tons of parks) I have no idea why that would be a big deal so I called back and spoke to the manager and she was completely confused by that reason. Then she told me it was denied because our dogs were extroverts and this particular dog was introverted.

Now I own two Craigslist cats. Places like these are part of the issue. It\u2019s harder to adopt a pet than become the parent of a whole human.", "NTA, but it was probably because you were a college student and she was looking for an excuse to say no. I worked at a humane society in a college town, and our director was really against adopting out to students because the living situation could change so easily so would find any excuse to say no.", "NTA. I'd follow up with a *very calm and professional* letter to the board or CEO of the rescue outlining your concerns. Then I'd go somewhere else to get a cat. It shouldn't be harder to adopt an old sick cat than to foster a kid.", "NTA alot of the private shelters are that way - they don't want to give up those animals.  The only thing I can think of is they must get money from the government per animal.  Or maybe they have found that donations go up if they are at max capacity.  IDK, like your partner said - fishy.  Go the the county humane shelter they are more than willing to give you a chance.  I've gotten several pets from mine.", "NTA - I have volunteered at multiple shelters, and there is always one person working there who sets unreasonable terms to give up the animals.

Nope! Even if a cat has lived its entire life in a studio flat, they will not allow it to be adopted by a responsible middle-aged couple who both work from home and make good money, because a three-story, four-bedroom house is simply not enough space for a cat.\n\nWho cares if we live near the intersection of two busy roads? Who cares if there are foxes and an aggressive street tom in our neighbourhood? Nope, we may absolutely not have a cat under any circumstances unless we let it outdoors.\n\nOK, we thought. What about a cat with FIV or something that can't be allowed out?\n\nNope, we don't own our home (even though it belongs to my in-laws and they rent it to us, we're not getting evicted anytime soon), so it's an \"unstable environment\".\n\nWe ended up buying a kitten off Gumtree, which is what they supposedly *don't* want people doing. But we'd been trying for a year after our previous cat died -- a cat I loved so much that I brought him from the US to the UK when I moved here -- and we were miserable without a cat in the house. We didn't want a kitten, but people aren't out there selling their adult cats. So we figured, well, at least if we buy the kitten, it's guaranteed a good, spoiled, comfortable life.\n\nBloody idiots.", "\"and what if your backup dies? WHAT THEN? Do THEY have a backup, huh?

They said \"which one?\" I said \"that one\". They said \"sign here\" I did. Brought him home the next day after he was neutered. Now, do I think it should be that easy? No, actually I don't. I think they should have a database shared with the county. It keeps track of you, how many animals you have adopted and when, and if you have ever been convicted of a crime against animals or hoarding. That's the dream, lol.

Generally by law in the US a municipal shelter cannot refuse adoption unless the applicant has a criminal history of animal abuse or neglect.

All you need is 40 dollars and a pulse.", "A super full senior cat shelter can't afford to be too choosey though. I can understand high requirements for kittens, because there it is not so hard to find someone wanting to adopt them and they have a long life in front of them, but not many people want senior cats which either have already health issues or might get some soon. \n\nWhat is the shelter worker thinking will happen to the senior cats they have to turn away because they are full? Other shelters won't be empty either and when they will need room the animals least likely to get adopted will be euthanized there. \n\nIt is better to take a chance with a college student than act this way and likely doom another cat.", "Thank you, that could be it! \n\nI live in an area where more and more rentals are forcing properties to be pet free and it's caused a huge influx of surrenders. \n\nAfter a while, I even went and got a document from the company I lease from. I attached part of my rental contract with an extra agreement that was stamped and dated by my landlords building complex company that they would not be changing their animal policy. \n\nI was sure I had all my ducks in a row, including the number of the vet I use as reference as well. \n\nThey are good to keep on hand because my dog was really aggressive before.

She told me that if I didn't keep the names she gave them, she would not let me keep them. I just agreed, bc she seemed on the verge of a mental breakdown. Eventually she left and I just went ahead and renamed them and ignored the loads of emails she sent me about how Im not to rename them and she wants proof from a future vet visit that I kept their names.

We adopted a 15 year old dog after his owner found herself unexpectedly homeless. It was one of the hardest decisions she ever made and it tore her up inside to have to surrender her beloved pet, but she did right by him in the safest way she could at that moment.

These rescues are getting out of hand, seriously.", "And potentially destructive, as working dogs tend to want to get out that energy.", "To quote the Wikipedia page on breed-specific legislation: \"The following 17 states prohibit their municipalities from passing breed-specific laws: Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Nevada, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Utah and South Dakota. California prohibits most breed-specific laws, but allows breed-specific spay/neuter.\"\n\nI've never had an issue with renters insurance, but I know it varies by company.", "If this were the case, I would start reaching out to grantors, funders, and try to get her 501c3 pulled because that is sketchy as hell.", "Not sure if it's the same but I read a similar story but it was mainly aimed at the shelter trying to lie about how well trained their pitbulls were since noone was adopting them because they all had various violent reactive pasts", "I don't know how enforceable it is, but a LOT of rescue contracts state that they reserve the right to take back any adopted animal if mistreatment is suspected, for the rest of the animal's life. And I've come across some rescues that don't allow the microchip name and address to be changed. \n\nOnce again, I don't know how enforceable the contracts are, but rescues are at least attempting to scare people with it.", "I know from experience that big rental companies in California often have weight restrictions on pets (\"no more than 20lbs\"), and that seemed very breed-adjacent while not violating the letter of the law.", "As long as you don't organise them in alphabetical order by the first line of each book.", "You know, I considered something like that with my own issues with a local rescue- I had organized it for the rescue, got sponsors, was donating supplies and everything, and the president/organizer canceled when she disagreed with me about how to handle money and accused me of taking advantage of her. But at the end of the day, if they\u2019re actually helping animals, does it really matter to me that she\u2019s destroying her volunteer network and captaining a sinking ship?", "I'm dealing with this right now with my family. They have a dog who almost went into a diabetic coma one night and I had to fight to get them to take him to the vet to get diagnosed with diabetes. I was fighting for it for 1-2 months already but they never did anything until he almost became paralyzed. He has lost his eyesight, is losing his fur currently, never wags his tail anymore, and has multiple open wounds on his body that bother him. No doubt he is in constant pain. They are refusing to take him to the vet again, saying that they will \"try\". I told them that they have taken on the responsibility of caring for a diabetic dog, and that requires vet visits. \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can be fine with seeing an animal suffer because they do not want to let go. It's selfish and cruel. The poor dog became diabetic because of them overfeeding and now his life isn't much of a life anymore.", "This happens SO much. Then they push them on families with children. Sometimes the most humane thing is to put the dog down.", "Yeah I question the actually helping animals piece. I hope so/am glad that they were in your case", "I'm sorry about your kitty.
