John\u2019s the oldest of 9. We\u2019re all home schooled and religion is very important but we\u2019ve never had much issues. John especially. \n\nBut he met Holly a couple months ago. And well she gave my mom a heart attack. I\u2019m not judging her at all, but she\u2019s had multiple boyfriends before my brother, posts on her social media quite a bit and dresses in things that are inappropriate(maybe?). \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit, but I wasn\u2019t very nice to her. But that\u2019s just because I wanted to be like her so bad. My mom was especially hard on her though.\n\nShe said some crazy things about her dating history, about how she corrupted John etc. My mom always had this \u201ckind\u201d image so seeing her act like how she did woke me up. \n\nJohn moved out to live with Holly and doesn\u2019t talk to our parents anymore. He\u2019s different. \n\nMy mom\u2019s heartbroken. Dad is too but he\u2019s ignoring the issue while my mom\u2019s stuck on how the vile creature stole her good and pure son. I think it\u2019s ridiculous but I do feel for my mom a bit so I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. \n\nBut yesterday she saw Holly and John. According to my little sibling that was with my mom, they were acting all cutesy and in love. My mom was ENRAGED.\n\nShe started ranting about how girls like Holly are the evilest kind and that while she\u2019s lost her son to her, at least her daughters are good girls. She then came up to me and made me promise to never be like Holly. I was going to promise her at first but I was just so tired of her nonsense. I said no. \n\nShe looked a bit surprised and I kind of lost it and said that Holly\u2019s actually really cool and a much better person than most women I\u2019ve met, her body count or the way she dresses be damned. I saw my mom start to cry but I couldn\u2019t help it. I told my mom that to me, Holly is a better person than she\u2019ll ever be and also that I\u2019d rather be just like Holly than like her.\n\nMy mom cried even harder and said that I broke her heart just like John did and also said she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m choosing Holly over her. She ran to her room and hasn\u2019t really come out since. My dad\u2019s upset with me and I feel terrible now. I should\u2019ve just not said anything. But it felt good to tell her.

It definitely seems like your mom has made no attempt to get to know Holly and only wants to judge her. This kind of behavior will only drive more of her kids away and make them never want to talk to your mom again.\nSounds like your mother has been trying to teach all about the hate in religion instead of love.", "NTA. Your mother sounds like the type of people that give religion a bad name. Remind her, \u201cJudge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.\u201d", "NTA as you are still young and I'm guessing...a bit sheltered in a house of rules and beliefs. Your brother stepped out and into the 21st century modern world and it is his choice if he wants to join it. While the bursting out could have been handled better, I think it is great you don't stay oppressed in your thoughts (and your mom was shaming the poor girl). Good luck, it may be a rough road until you are a legal adult to choose what you want to.", "NTA, she needs to get over herself. She sounds like she might be/become a toxic parent if you're not careful.", "NTA. If Holly makes your brother happy, your parents should support that. Not everyone in the world will share their judgemental opinions, and they have no right to try and impose them. Could you reach out and apologise to Holly, and start to repair your relationship with your brother?", "NTA.  \nSpeaking to you as a Christian (not sure what religion you are) - we are taught to love and welcome everyone. Sadly some people seem to ignore/miss this aspect of our faith and they react like your mom did, in hatred. Hate has never changed hearts. Your mother is in the wrong. Holly deserves a chance like we all do.", "Soft NTA. Good for you for thinking for and expressing yourself. You were definitely right to defend Holly and tell your mother she was being unfair and unkind. Plus, her reactions to everything seem REALLY over dramatic. You're not choosing Holly over her. SHE'S the one who decided it's her or Holly. But my judgment is \"soft\" because your words were very harsh, especially the \"better person than you'll ever be\" part. But...it's hard to hold back in conflicts like that, and it's even harder when you're a teenager.\n\nKeep following your own path, but hopefully that doesn't mean ultimatums from your family like with John. Maybe if enough of your siblings join the current century they'll learn to b live and let live.", "NTA. Your mother knows now that you\u2019re going to live your life as you see fit. She can start getting used to the idea, because if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s going to lose another child.", "Nta. The world doesn't revolve around your mother. She should have shown more grace to Holly.", "NTA It sounds like you chose yourself. Your mom seems to need control. It's unfair of her to only accept people who accept her as the boss. Be your own person. No need to be like your mother or Holly.", "NTA your mother needs to get help. you and your brother are both adults youre going to have adult lives and date and have sex and its not her business to control it. she also shouldn\u2019t be crying and \u2018heartbroken\u2019 when her children disagree with her and find love. its not healthy for her and its not a safe and healthy environment for you or your brother. the entire context + controlling behaviour makes me really worried for you. i hope you\u2019re doing well yourself. this is not normal or appropriate behaviour from your mother. on any level.", "NTA. You're being raised in narrow circumstances and your brother set an example by getting out. Follow.", "Tl;DR: NTA generally, but you were kind of a dick.\n\nSo first off, your mom is just wrong. She has every right to live her life in a religious conservative fashion if she wants, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong or evil about Holly, she sounds like a very average 20 yr old American girl (tbf idk if you're American, but here she'd be average). Just cause she shows skin and has maybe had sex doesn't make her a she-devil.\n\nIt also doesn't even sound like your brother is really rejecting his upbringing, he just has a more liberal GF than your mom is prepared to accept and is probably limiting contact with your family because he can tell your family, or your mom at least, disapprove.\n\nYou are also well within your rights to express your support for Holly and your brothers relationship. There is nothing wrong with saying you disagree and think Holly is a good person. Better than most even.\n\nWhere your story crosses the line for me is how you put your mom down while expressing that opinion. \n\nYour mom was probably raised in a religious bubble, and tried to raise her kids in that same bubble, and now her kids are becoming adults and her bubble is being abruptly burst. She feels like she's losing her son, and maybe she is, albeit due to her own inability to accept his life choices, but she's very vulnerable right now nonetheless. You chose to go beyond just \"I think you're wrong and Holly is a good person\" to \"I think you're wrong and Holly is a good person. I even think she's better than you and would rather be like her\".\n\nI waffled for a while over NTA and YTA because again, I agree with your opinion generally, but you were also kind of a dick to your mom even though she kind of had it coming for being so judgemental. Ultimately, you're 18 and it's a lot to ask of someone your age to have a non-emotional reaction to a situation like this, so if I have to go one way or another, I'd say NTA. But try to find less harsh ways to express your dissent and desire to live less conservatively in the future. It's not going to help your mom accept these  changes in her life if you're aggressive about it.", "Biggest YTA ever. I truly feel sorry for your mother. You should go live with Holly since you want to be her. Don't be surprised if your parents kick you out. I would.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or do they have a history of manipulation, selfishness, guilt tripping, mooching, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you *did* do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed. \n\n**However** if you *didn\u2019t* do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n-\tYou\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they **choose** to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else **chooses** to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s *their* choice to make- *let them be upset!*\n-\tYou are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on *them* to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices. \n-\tIt\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it. \n-\tJust because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong.

Good luck, you may just reunite your family on an authentic level.\n\nI know religion, please remind her we go to the \u2018pearly gates\u2019 alone. No where does religion say we are valued on how well we fit in society or impose our views on others. Quite the opposite, religion actually teaches to do what is right and YOU value - because that\u2019s what your deity sees. It\u2019s a very 1-1(/more) tango. None of what others told you or who wrote what when, and how it would/should/could be taken today, matters at that point. All those stories tell a message that someone of knowledge of the times thought was worth adding for future. Take what YOU can from them, and society, and make sure it\u2019s something that one day you can defend come what may\u2026imho.\n\nETA: Just saw this randomly, and thought of your OP.

Your brother has tasted real freedom and is exercising his right to self determination, and your controlling mother is employing narcissistic level manipulation tactics by manufacturing \u201cteams\u201d.  This is behavior common in adults with serious insecurities and who fail to mature emotionally and socially, and they become narcissistic and entitled. You see this in far right conservative/religious culture, a lot.  Your mother doesn\u2019t view people as equals, but rather, a part of a social hierarchy that places her children - even as adults - below her and it\u2019s an affront to her value system that two of her adult children have asserted their own power and said \u201cno\u201d.  authoritarianism, as you\u2019ve experienced, eventually comes back to bite them when their adult children, no longer dependent upon them for survival and in the real world, learn how the authoritarian has used their power to abuse and control them, have no choice but to cut contact because narcissists don\u2019t self reflect, can\u2019t learn and grow socially or emotionally, and often employ manipulative tactics to restore the social order to which they feel entitled.  That is, they are incapable of healthy relationships.  They are always the hero, the martyr, the victim. Nothing is ever their fault. They often stray far from reality and reason, employ cognitive dissonance in order to maintain this view of themselves. I suggest reading about narcissism and cults, and establishing healthy boundaries so that you can better understand what you\u2019re dealing with and develop your own strategies to navigate your difficult situation.", "I speak as a Christian and a believer here (Dont downvote me YET) but I always hate the way this type of people forget this one quote \"Judge not, lest ye be judged\" theres also another quote about whited sephulcre's thats approprriate.

And it\u2019s okay to try and keep your children from being expose to age inappropriate material or dressing too adult for their age. But you have to let go at some point, allow to them see society and decide where they wish to be within and give them option to grow up and make their own choices.\n\nChildren who are sheltered and oppressed go one of the routes. They grow up, and become oppressive and controlling, they grow go absolutely wild and do everything they never got to do, or at the very best (and a good route to go) they just start making their decisions and forming their own opinions. Given your strict upbringing you are dealing with this really well. You are realizing you don\u2019t necessarily want to live that way and you are drawing boundaries. Whether you said it nicer or just straight up ran away, your mom was always going to be hurt if you wouldn\u2019t do exactly what she wanted you to do.

I\u2019m sure she loves you too, but religion teaches girls are a lot less valuable (like Holly). I seriously doubt your mom is going to come to terms with this, at least not easily.

Keep pushing.", "Christianity breaks people's brains", "ESH except probably Holly. \n\nYou should apologize to your mother for *specifically* speaking harshly to her in public about a sensitive situation. Then tell her that you'd never seen her act like anything but A Good Christian Woman before Holly entered your lives and that you're growing tired of her being hypocritical about John finding someone he cares enough about to start trying to live an adult life, which is the whole reason your holy book tells you people are supposed to be on earth. You tell her that you are apologizing to her for reacting too strongly in public to the on-going judgement and mean behavior toward Holly you're seeing, that you were raised to believe is supposed to be turned toward love and kindness instead (love your enemies is in the red letters in the old testament-- reportedly right from jesus himself). You lost your temper and were disrespectful when what you wanted was a calm adult conversation. It's just not possible to have those when your mother turns her feelings about your brother onto you. \n\nThere are Bible verses that support all of this. Genesis has one about a man shall leave his family and cleave to his wife (ch 3 or 4 I think? Been a while since I've had a need for it). The new testament talks about not judging others and not talking about others in a negative light or you make all christians look bad (Paul's letters, which also talk a lot about \"proper behavior for women\", which is where the pentecostals and southern baptists base their religious abuse of women). A good christian is supposed to be known by their works like the bible says jesus was; I think there are good references for that in Acts, but possibly in the books of Timothy or Titus. \n\nIf you need to make a point, you phrase is as you've \"never seen her choose to sin over and over again before\" when you've never seen Holly sin at all. It's \"uncomfortable and shameful to see her choosing to be so different from the loving mom you've always had.\" \n\nTo be blunt: your father sucks for not reminding his wife about her duty to keep being a good parent to you and any other siblings that are still at home and not have public meltdowns like that. He can't be neutral when his wife is having problems being a responsible adult. \n\nYour mother sucks for being so focused on losing control of your brother that she'll abuse Holly and you verbally and emotionally to make herself feel better at y'alls expense. \n\nYou probably went too far by saying you want to be like Holly instead of just wanting to be able to make your own decisions, but that's a slip of the tongue in the whole scheme of things. \n\nNow, that said, if you can't get your stuff and get out of the house entirely to a safe place, you're in a tight spot. You're 18; if you're in the U.S., legally your parents' responsibility for you is ending. They could tell you to get out and don't come back, and they'd probably get away with it. \n\nDepending on how deep the programming goes in your parents' church, they could get away with punishing you in weird ways or trying to 'reeducate you' for daring to be impulsive and rude to your mother. [Having a place to go that isn't associated with people from your church is probably a good move.](https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/) More info about those decisions is available at /r/exchristian /r/EXMO_Official /r/exjw and other \"recovering from religious abuse\" subs. \n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't know if you were actually abused in the name of religion or not but \"dresses inappropriately(maybe?)\" makes me wonder about that. If you can't see her private/baby-making parts, her clothes are probably not the problem-- the judgments of the people looking at her are. That's a sign of religious-based or \"spiritual\" abuse. \n\nIf you're 18 and don't know how someone gets (or gets someone) pregnant, that's another potential sign of religious abuse. So is dictating that you can't cut your hair short or color it, can't wear make up or jewelry, demanding that you only wear skirts and long sleeved shirts, not letting you talk to anyone that's not a church member, telling you that people of specific races or other spiritualities/religions are going to target you if you go out without people from your church or your parents. If you've been told that men can't help themselves and it's your responsibility \"not to tempt your bretheren\" by looking them in the eye, talking to them, etc. you may have been religiously abused. \n\nIf that stuff has happened, coupled with your mother's melt-down about her *20 year old son* holding hands with his girlfriend, you may as a family have been religiously abused. If your brother is old enough to be drafted into the military and die overseas somewhere, he's old enough to start figuring out adult relationships. If John and Holly are in a position to be part of that landing pad in case this escalates, getting in touch with them somehow with honest apologies for how you've acted up to now is a smart choice. You were a jerk to Holly by your own admission, but there's a clear reason why-- you have been taught to mistrust anything outside of your home schooled religious circle and we take a lot of cues from our parents in our young adulthood. But having an explanation doesn't mean you don't also have a responsibility to own up to out of line behavior. \n\nYour brother sucks since he could have tried to talk to you about what's been going on, but he's still learning how to adult through a conflict like this too so it's an understandable \"he sucks\".

Either way, you are 1000% right to tell your mom that she\u2019s been closed-minded and judgmental and cruel to a good person and you\u2019re not going to go along with it anymore. \n\nYou should be proud of the self-reflection that\u2019s evident in this post. You owned your initial negative reaction to and negative treatment of Holly, identified what was motivating you to react that way, and are challenging the beliefs you grew up with because they aren\u2019t matching your lived experience and were causing you to refuse connection with people you actually like and want to connect with. A lot of people don\u2019t have that level of self-insight and aren\u2019t willing to reconsider the belief structures they\u2019ve held onto even when those beliefs don\u2019t align with reality. \n\nTo give you some insight into your mom: a big reason why people cling so hard to judgmental and exclusionary beliefs is because those beliefs tell them that there is a right and wrong way to be a human being, and they\u2019ve been investing their sense of self in those beliefs\u2014which means they\u2019ve been working to make sure they are the right kind of person, and that necessitates that people who are doing things differently must be the wrong kind of person. If your mom admits that maybe she\u2019s wrong about Holly and that you actually can be a good person even if you wear certain clothes or date people or do lots of other normal human things, then your mom has to reconsider the beliefs she\u2019s been using to reassuring herself that she\u2019s a good person. It would really rearrange her sense of self to do that, and a lot of people are terrified of doing that work. \n\nThis is not an excuse for your mom mistreating your brother or his partner or anyone else, and it\u2019s not an excuse for her to not do that work\u2014she\u2019s an adult, and part of being human is continually learning and growing. You get stuck in really painful ways when you refuse to do that.

You have seen your mom be viscous to others based on external and superficial things, and you realized that not only was your mom not a good person, her love comes with strings attached. She preaches religion but does not act on the principles of it. And Holly was simply the embodiment of all the things you have seen being wrongfully judged by your mom, but was unable to articulate properly. Now you are mature enough, awake enough and assertive enough to do so. NTA. Your mom is going to lose more children if she does not change her ways.", "NTA. Congrats OP you broke away from the brainwashing! From what you are saying it sounds like you are already catching on... But the \"kindness\" you have seen from your mom is only ever going to be for people that think and act the same as your mom.\n\nPlease never we are all our own person and no matter how your mom tries to gaslight you.

I would not be shocked to find out that Holly and John met on a recovery forum.", "Louder for those in the back - OP, YOU ARE A LEGAL ADULT. **YOU CAN LEAVE ANYTIME YOU WANT TO**. Your parents would be arrested if they tried to prevent you because that would be illegal imprisonment of an adult. I'm genuinely curious about whether you've thought about asking your older brother for help getting out (and if not, WHY???). You can decide to go to college RIGHT NOW if you want. Your parents, community, and church are controlling you, but it's only because you're letting them. They have no rights over you anymore.", "I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I\u2019m sure the lack of internet access isn\u2019t the only thing that caused their weirdness but there are rumours that the older kids are very close to each other if you know what I mean. They\u2019re not very good at socializing and even though the oldest is much older than me, she still acts like a child.", "You obviously haven\u2019t watched Welcome to Plathville.

Interesting though, thank you!", "The kids in that family had zero education and you can\u2019t fake that.

Homeschooled, Christian. Strict purity culture all that fun stuff. I turned 18 and started using dating apps and eventually a year later got with my current boyfriend and now three years later we are expecting our first baby \n\nEven growing up in my teen years I was seen as someone who wasn\u2019t normal to a lot of these Christian homeschool moms. I always dyed my hair fun colors. I loved to wear dark colors. Watched non Christian shows. But the main thing I got judged for was a self harm issue I had for multiple years. Luckily my parents never knew about it until someone I was close too told my moms pastor (that\u2019s a whole other story) who eventually would tell her a year after I had left my family to live with my boyfriend \n\nI grew up hearing constantly that I was possessed by demons. That I was going to end up a slut. That I wasn\u2019t a true Christian because of my political believes. That I would end up in a unhappy marriage and only experience loneliness for the rest of my life. My mom eventually found out I would sneak to my boyfriends and that I had had a miscarriage and lied to her about my life. Not only her but so many of my family and close friends growing up blamed him for changing me and taking me away from God. But what he did was save me from this life I had lived and all these lies I had believed growing up. \n\nConfronting her about it was the thing to do. Most of the time these parents get upset because of the image that gets put on them about being a bad parent because their child didn\u2019t listen to what Christian and purity culture has always taught them. Me and my mom are on way better terms now but she has so many people asking her why me and my bf aren\u2019t married and she always goes on a long rant about how this isn\u2019t what she wants for me and almost tries to blame him for taking me away from God and that he corrupted me etc. when really all of this was a complete personal choice. The worst part is having to leave my siblings behind and knowing that they\u2019re hearing all these lies about me from my parents. It\u2019s sucks. Please stick up for him. I\u2019m not sure if you and him are on talking terms or anything but if you can reach out to him and let him know you still care about him and love him and him knowing you really do like his girlfriend could help him feel some kind of slight relief. Because trust me I wish I would\u2019ve heard one of my siblings tell me that. I\u2019m sure he desperately needs to hear it. Because the truth is your mom\u2019s opinion may never change, if it does that\u2019s amazing. But you can\u2019t depend on it. What\u2019s important is showing him and his gf that you do care.", "NTA and given your names figuring western religion.   If that's the case have your mom read the bible.\n\nLot's of versus about love and acceptance, she is acting very bitter and hateful.

I'm sure it can be scary and new things can be intimidating, but they are often the things really worth doing!", "While I agree with you generally and know of homeschooling families that I am not cool with... Having the freedom to choose your child's education and save them from a horrible public school situation without needing to pay out of pocket for private school is fundamental.  If you have a gifted kid or a twice exceptional kid then fighting for the school to accommodate them when there is no mandate is nearly impossible.  \"I have nothing for him (in second grade).  I think you should skip him (how many grades? Do those grades progress at an accelerated rate because he learns faster than others and it's intense to deal with him at times, I know). Are those teachers patient?  His second grade literacy teacher helped him to develop facial tics before he could understand that she was being shitty to him.  Will those teachers help him remember to use the bathroom so he doesn't have an accident in front of his older peers?  Development can be asynchronous.  In fifth grade we have different level classes.  Just wait.\".  \"Your daughter isn't eligible for speech services despite having the articulation of a 4 year old while actually being 7 years old.

I homeschooled for 3 years and it was generally a good thing.  A few years of private school and the local highschool is a much better situation with a lot of opportunities.  It's going well.  My kids have retained their love of learning.", "Home schooling is abused by people to push their own agenda, and that should not be allowed. However it can be very good and the only option for some families. Examples of this is when they do not live near a school, so commuting would take many hours or just not be an option for them. Another one and the main reason I think home schooling is needed is health reasons. Be it temporary or permanent, it just causes students to be unable to attend classes and do the work in the restraints of the school setting or anything else school related. I personally had to do home school after I started chemo because I was too sick to cope or keep up in classes, as I was missing tons from being sick and when I did make it I was still to sick to actually do anything in class. Home school let me work at my own pace and rest when I needed to and way less pressure as there were long times before and flexibility with due dates. I had some issues with it, but that was mostly my own doing. I believe home school should not be eliminated, but I think there should be tighter rules on who can use it so it is not abused.", "You obviously don't know how it works in my town.  As long as the kids are feed and not abused then they don't care.  Again this family lives in the same town as I do.", "NTA, you're setting boundaries and growing up.  Healthy.", "I don't know what faith you are, but I'm assuming some sort of Christian faith?  I won't claim knowledge of all the denominations but the bible i read talked about \"hating the sin not the sinner\".  There is also a story about Jesus stopping an adulter from being stoned.  \"let ye who is without sin cast the first stone\".  This isn't condoning the behavior of the woman, but treating someone who might have done something immortal with love.\n\nI would expect having grown up in a faithful home, you could make arguments from scripture against your mothers aggressive behavior, without condoning any immoral behavior which may have happened in the past.\n\nof course im aware not all Christian or even all faiths have the same view on this topic.  Mormonism for example would absolutely not condone such behavior under any circumstance, and any chance to argue against your mother will be fruitless, because to your mother even contemplating a sinful life is a big enough reason to be swept into hell without mercy.  so a mother will be extremely harsh out of pure panic for your immortal soul.  to her it will be anger due to her love and fear.  I don't agree with mormanism, but I'm not here to disparage anyone's faith.  just hoping to help you navigate this.  In a morman household what you said to your mother would be akin to telling her your a devil worshiper, well one step away.  so as to not pick on the mormans the Catholics would have a sorta similar view on the subject though not quite as hard core, given there is confession which can help with the sinning part when you realize your mistake.\n\nso you've got a difficult path for you, it's possible you can talk scripture and help resolve this... or it might be impossible.  If it's impossible, then your best bet will be to apologize to your mother, and just keep quiet about it until your old enough to move out.\n\njust remember there is one of the 10 commandments that matter in this case.  \"honor thy father and mother\", again, i don't know your faith, but i'm making some guesses in hopes something will help, once upon a time a pastor threatened to make me a pastor.  So i am well read on the bible, and might be able to assist.  however i am aware not all parts of Christianity see these issues the same.\n\nI know your actions came from a place of love for your brother and his girlfriend, and i know to most of the ammoral folks around here your mom seems like one of thsoe intolerant religious fundimentalists they all think are out to ruin everyones lives so it's easy to side with you in this.  but i suspect you feel really bad that you made your mom cry.  that's probably a sign, that though you acted out of love for your brother you probably did so in a way which was...  wrong.  \n\na wise man once said the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  because you might be right morally and even religiously (depending on your faith) it still harmed your mother badly.  and while you live under that roof you're going to have to figure out how to make it right.  without more information i can't really help further.  but i do pray you all find a resolution which heals everyone's heart and doesn't result in your brother or yourself being ostracized from the family.", "I applaud you for standing up to your backwards controlling mother. It would have been so hard. Your mother sounds like such a hateful woman and is struggling to deal with the fact you\u2019re old enough to have your own opinions and not the one\u2019s she has shoved down your throat. \n\nNTA", "NTA!", "NTA.
