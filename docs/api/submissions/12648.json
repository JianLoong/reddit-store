John\u2019s the oldest of 9. We\u2019re all home schooled and religion is very important but we\u2019ve never had much issues. John especially. \n\nBut he met Holly a couple months ago. And well she gave my mom a heart attack. I\u2019m not judging her at all, but she\u2019s had multiple boyfriends before my brother, posts on her social media quite a bit and dresses in things that are inappropriate(maybe?). \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit, but I wasn\u2019t very nice to her. But that\u2019s just because I wanted to be like her so bad. My mom was especially hard on her though.\n\nShe said some crazy things about her dating history, about how she corrupted John etc. My mom always had this \u201ckind\u201d image so seeing her act like how she did woke me up. \n\nJohn moved out to live with Holly and doesn\u2019t talk to our parents anymore. He\u2019s different. \n\nMy mom\u2019s heartbroken. Dad is too but he\u2019s ignoring the issue while my mom\u2019s stuck on how the vile creature stole her good and pure son. I think it\u2019s ridiculous but I do feel for my mom a bit so I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. \n\nBut yesterday she saw Holly and John. According to my little sibling that was with my mom, they were acting all cutesy and in love. My mom was ENRAGED.\n\nShe started ranting about how girls like Holly are the evilest kind and that while she\u2019s lost her son to her, at least her daughters are good girls. She then came up to me and made me promise to never be like Holly. I was going to promise her at first but I was just so tired of her nonsense. I said no. \n\nShe looked a bit surprised and I kind of lost it and said that Holly\u2019s actually really cool and a much better person than most women I\u2019ve met, her body count or the way she dresses be damned. I saw my mom start to cry but I couldn\u2019t help it. I told my mom that to me, Holly is a better person than she\u2019ll ever be and also that I\u2019d rather be just like Holly than like her.\n\nMy mom cried even harder and said that I broke her heart just like John did and also said she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m choosing Holly over her. She ran to her room and hasn\u2019t really come out since. My dad\u2019s upset with me and I feel terrible now. I should\u2019ve just not said anything. But it felt good to tell her.

It definitely seems like your mom has made no attempt to get to know Holly and only wants to judge her. This kind of behavior will only drive more of her kids away and make them never want to talk to your mom again.\nSounds like your mother has been trying to teach all about the hate in religion instead of love.", "NTA. Your mother sounds like the type of people that give religion a bad name. Remind her, \u201cJudge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.\u201d", "NTA as you are still young and I'm guessing...a bit sheltered in a house of rules and beliefs. Your brother stepped out and into the 21st century modern world and it is his choice if he wants to join it. While the bursting out could have been handled better, I think it is great you don't stay oppressed in your thoughts (and your mom was shaming the poor girl). Good luck, it may be a rough road until you are a legal adult to choose what you want to.", "NTA, she needs to get over herself. She sounds like she might be/become a toxic parent if you're not careful.", "NTA. If Holly makes your brother happy, your parents should support that. Not everyone in the world will share their judgemental opinions, and they have no right to try and impose them. Could you reach out and apologise to Holly, and start to repair your relationship with your brother?", "NTA.  \nSpeaking to you as a Christian (not sure what religion you are) - we are taught to love and welcome everyone. Sadly some people seem to ignore/miss this aspect of our faith and they react like your mom did, in hatred. Hate has never changed hearts. Your mother is in the wrong. Holly deserves a chance like we all do.", "Soft NTA. Good for you for thinking for and expressing yourself. You were definitely right to defend Holly and tell your mother she was being unfair and unkind. Plus, her reactions to everything seem REALLY over dramatic. You're not choosing Holly over her. SHE'S the one who decided it's her or Holly. But my judgment is \"soft\" because your words were very harsh, especially the \"better person than you'll ever be\" part. But...it's hard to hold back in conflicts like that, and it's even harder when you're a teenager.\n\nKeep following your own path, but hopefully that doesn't mean ultimatums from your family like with John. Maybe if enough of your siblings join the current century they'll learn to b live and let live.", "NTA. Your mother knows now that you\u2019re going to live your life as you see fit. She can start getting used to the idea, because if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s going to lose another child.", "Nta. The world doesn't revolve around your mother. She should have shown more grace to Holly.", "NTA It sounds like you chose yourself. Your mom seems to need control. It's unfair of her to only accept people who accept her as the boss. Be your own person. No need to be like your mother or Holly.", "NTA your mother needs to get help. you and your brother are both adults youre going to have adult lives and date and have sex and its not her business to control it. she also shouldn\u2019t be crying and \u2018heartbroken\u2019 when her children disagree with her and find love. its not healthy for her and its not a safe and healthy environment for you or your brother. the entire context + controlling behaviour makes me really worried for you. i hope you\u2019re doing well yourself. this is not normal or appropriate behaviour from your mother. on any level.", "NTA. You're being raised in narrow circumstances and your brother set an example by getting out. Follow.", "Tl;DR: NTA generally, but you were kind of a dick.\n\nSo first off, your mom is just wrong. She has every right to live her life in a religious conservative fashion if she wants, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong or evil about Holly, she sounds like a very average 20 yr old American girl (tbf idk if you're American, but here she'd be average). Just cause she shows skin and has maybe had sex doesn't make her a she-devil.\n\nIt also doesn't even sound like your brother is really rejecting his upbringing, he just has a more liberal GF than your mom is prepared to accept and is probably limiting contact with your family because he can tell your family, or your mom at least, disapprove.\n\nYou are also well within your rights to express your support for Holly and your brothers relationship. There is nothing wrong with saying you disagree and think Holly is a good person. Better than most even.\n\nWhere your story crosses the line for me is how you put your mom down while expressing that opinion. \n\nYour mom was probably raised in a religious bubble, and tried to raise her kids in that same bubble, and now her kids are becoming adults and her bubble is being abruptly burst. She feels like she's losing her son, and maybe she is, albeit due to her own inability to accept his life choices, but she's very vulnerable right now nonetheless. You chose to go beyond just \"I think you're wrong and Holly is a good person\" to \"I think you're wrong and Holly is a good person. I even think she's better than you and would rather be like her\".\n\nI waffled for a while over NTA and YTA because again, I agree with your opinion generally, but you were also kind of a dick to your mom even though she kind of had it coming for being so judgemental. Ultimately, you're 18 and it's a lot to ask of someone your age to have a non-emotional reaction to a situation like this, so if I have to go one way or another, I'd say NTA. But try to find less harsh ways to express your dissent and desire to live less conservatively in the future. It's not going to help your mom accept these  changes in her life if you're aggressive about it.", "Biggest YTA ever. I truly feel sorry for your mother. You should go live with Holly since you want to be her. Don't be surprised if your parents kick you out. I would.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or do they have a history of manipulation, selfishness, guilt tripping, mooching, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you *did* do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed. \n\n**However** if you *didn\u2019t* do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n-\tYou\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they **choose** to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else **chooses** to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s *their* choice to make- *let them be upset!*\n-\tYou are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on *them* to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n-\tIt\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices. \n-\tIt\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it. \n-\tJust because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong.

Their emotions are *their* responsibility to manage.\n-\t**Being a good person does not equal being a doormat!** You can be a kind, generous person *and* set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you. \n-\tYou matter too!
