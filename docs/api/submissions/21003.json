{"id": 21003, "submission_id": "14n5ah0", "title": "AITA for not wanting to force my daughter to chew her food 35 times before swallowing?", "selftext": "Hi everybody! I\u2019ve been married to my husband Raj for 10 years and we have a daughter, Maya, who\u2019s 7.\n\nBackground context: Raj\u2019s brother Seth died in a choking accident when he was 7. Their parents weren\u2019t watching them and Raj was only 4 when it happened, so he didn\u2019t know what was going on. This really affected Raj since he and Seth were close. Raj got into the mindset that Seth\u2019s death was his fault and he could\u2019ve prevented it, so it took years of therapy to try and move past that idea. \n\nHowever, I recently noticed that Raj has been staring at Maya while we\u2019re eating dinner and refuses to leave her alone whenever she\u2019s eating something in general. When I asked him what he was doing, he said he wants to make sure she doesn\u2019t choke. But then he said he wants to start forcing her to chew every single bite of food 35 times before she swallows it to minimize the risk of choking. He also said this applies to soft foods as well. \n\nRaj never brought up this concern before, so I was kind of surprised. But I think it was brought on by the fact that Maya is same age Seth was when he passed. I gently sat him down and said that Maya is old enough to know how to chew her food properly and forcing her to chew every bite 35 times is excessive and unnecessary. It would also make mealtimes last much, much longer and would mess up our schedules. \n\nRaj got upset with me and argued that we need to do everything we can to protect our daughter and it\u2019s better to be overprotective than not protective enough. I asked what we were going to do about her eating at school since we can\u2019t watch her there. He said we should send Maya to school with a note that says she must be watched at lunch by an aide and the aide has to make her chew everything 35 times. I said that\u2019s a massive overkill and the aides have better things to do at lunch, but he wasn\u2019t having it and said it\u2019s our job as parents to protect Maya, even if it\u2019s inconvenient. \n\nI understand Raj has lasting trauma surrounding the death of his brother, but I don\u2019t want to make Maya resent us. I suggested sitting Maya down and stressing the importance of chewing food properly, but Raj said his way was the only way we\u2019d be able to fully protect her. \n\nI said I was sorry, but I\u2019m not going to force Maya to chew everything 35 times because it\u2019s simply not sustainable in the long run. Raj got angry and accused me of not caring about Maya. \n\nWe\u2019ve decided to post on here asking for judgment since we\u2019re sort of at an impasse (Raj knows I\u2019m posting). We\u2019ll both be reading, so please let us know who\u2019s the asshole here!", "created_utc": 1688142968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n5ah0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_force_my_daughter_to_chew/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one will ever replace your brother. But imposing your trauma on your daughter is not the way to protect her. Asking for an aide, whos job is NOT to watch your fully functioning daughter chew her food is a ridiculous ask and one that any school with good administration will not adhere to. You need to continue to work through your trauma and not project it on your child or accuse your own partner of not caring. YTA.\n\nOP-NTA.", "It is very very difficult to chew anything other than gum for 35 times. I suggest both of you (esp Raj) try it.   \nEither you'd have to take huuuuge mouthfuls or you're eating very very tough food. Either way, this is over controlling, unrealistic and not normal. \n\nRaj has issues (understandably) and he is projecting them onto your daughter. Women have a tough enough time in our relationship with food, so please please please have Raj get some therapy before he warps his daughter's eating behaviours and hurts his relationship with his family.\n\nA better way to help Raj cope might be for both of you to take First Aid and CPR, including CPR for children. \n\nI hope things get better for Raj and I am sorry he lost his brother.\n\nNTA.", "Info: Does HE chew everything 35 times?", "NTA. You\u2019re entirely right- this is absolutely unsustainable, and no school is going to dedicate an aide to counting how many times ONE child chews. What about all the other children? Absolutely unreasonable to expect this. It will alienate your daughter from her peers and subject her to intense ridicule as well. \n\nYour husband needs more therapy. \nLike serious, intense therapy.  He cannot hope to manage every bite his daughter chews until he\u2019s an adult. \n\nThings can happen to anyone at any time. She could choke, yes- but she could also be in a car accident, or get hurt on the playground or get  sick. he\u2019s fixating on the one disaster he has experience with but ignoring every other potential disaster, so his argument that he is protecting her isn\u2019t logical in the least.", "No, that is really not reasonable.  Generally emphasizing the need to eat slowly and chew food thoroughly is a great idea.  Insisting on exactly 35 chews for every bite is over the top and unsustainable.  She probably cannot even count that high yet!  \n\nAsking an aide to watch her do that at school is over kill too and, aside from the fact that they are highly unlikely to do it, it is going to make Maya's life so much more difficult because you are \"those\" parents. \n\nOn top of all that, this is a good way to give her life-long food issues. \n\nAccidents happen.  \n\nMy dad (who is closer to 90 than 80), was 7ish years old when he saw his younger brother die.  In that time and place, you boiled water to take a bath.  The maid made mistake of putting the hot water in first.  Little brother slipped and fell in before the cold water was added.  Yes, we all got frequent reminders about turning on the cold tap first from both him and grandmother--but that was it.  Although both were clearly traumatized by the situation.   \n\nYou cannot let accidents ruin your life going forward.  You can learn from them.  You can be more cautious.  But not at the expense of quality of life.  And that 35 chews thing is going to have so many ramifications for poor Maya.", "NTA I\u2019m worried that making her chew her food 35 times will cause some weird OCD thing with her later in life. Also, if by chance someone at school will sit and count her bites (they won\u2019t) she\u2019s going to be looked at by the other kids as weird.  This is all completely unrealistic. Protecting your child is discussing the fact she can slow down when eating and make sure she chews. But enforcing a number of chews is just odd.", "NTA.  His paranoia, while understandable, is going to give her an eating disorder, and he could be more responsible and proactive by a) getting therapy, and b) taking an infant/child CPR class.", "NTA. Being overprotective can be just as bad as not being protective at all. Does he want to just lock her in a padded room her whole life? My suggestion is that you two find some first aid classes that deal with choking and CPR and keep going every two years to renew. That way you can be the protection without being an overbearing, kind of insane, parent. I constantly have to do first aid training for my job and I love having that knowledge. \n\nEdit: Grammar", "NTA. He needs to work through that trauma and not let it make a new problem. 35 times is unreasonable. Hell, even after I had gastric surgery, 20 chews was enough for solid food. \n\nWould talking with a pediatrician about appropriate chewing practices help ease his concerns?", "She is 7. His brother was 7.  He is triggered.  Tell him you understand, but he is reacting to his trauma. He might need a little jaunt with therapy to get through this stressful year.", "NTA.  Quite frankly that is just gross.  Chewing a bite of food for 35 times is beyond excessive.  I'm sorry for his trauma but he needs to learn to deal with it without forcing issues onto other people such as your daughter.  The reality is that everybody gets choked up here and there regardless of how many times you chew.  I've choked on water!  He needs to back off before he causes food issues with her.", "Honestly the best way to help anyone not choke is to eat at a reasonable pace, not gobble food and not talk with food in their mouth. Think about this, if you ask her to chew 35 times she will be more focused on getting the \"chew\" in then in if she is masticating the food enough. She will do it fast so that she will not have to sit at the table for longer. She may become afraid to eat when someone is not watching or eat really fast when you are not around (kids can be rebellious or very compliant and in this case both would be harmful). OP NTA. Raj you are also not an AH but you will be if you go through with this plan. This is a scary time for you, go back to therapy to help you through. You guys can do this.", "It\u2019s time for Raj to get therapy for his unresolved issues. Also telling you that you must not care  about your daughter is cruel and kind of crap behaviors. I would really suggest getting him the help he needs. Over chewing can damage your kids teeth and she could bite her cheeks etc. This is bad. What next blend it and make her drink through a straw? NTA Raj is just in the wrong.", "Because of Raj's traumatic experience, he is making unreasonable demands of your daughter that could ultimately make it impossible for her to have a normal relationship with food (hello eating disorder) or with him.  The demand that an aide at school watch her chew is also both absurd and harmful to Maya.\n\nI would suggest that Raj get himself to a therapist to work through his feelings surrounding his brother's death, and his panic reaction to his daughter's eating.  But for now, he needs to back off, even though that will (irrationally) feel very scary and unsafe to him.  \n\nNTA", "Yooooo no no no. Don\u2019t micromanage how your kid eats.  That\u2019s not the right answer.\n\nThe right answer is to be certified in CPR and anti choking maneuvers.\n\nIt\u2019s a tragic loss and I fully understand the fear but you can\u2019t prevent accidents. You can only prepare as best you can to react if they happen.\n\nNo AH here, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and your whole situation. But please lighten up so your child doesn\u2019t have a unhealthy food relationship.", "When I was a senior in high school, I did a yearlong internship in a kindergarten class. One day, one of the kids swallowed a grape whole by mistake and couldn't breathe. Thankfully, my mother believed firmly that first aid training was a life skill and had made me stay First Aid/CPR certified from the moment I was old enough, and I was able to dislodge the grape before the school nurse even reached us. But seeing a kid that young turning blue with absolute terror in his eyes terrified the hell out of me. To this day, I get nervous watching kids eat grapes, even when I know rationally they're being safe about it. Choking risks in children are no joke.\n\nThat said, while I get where your husband is coming from, what he is asking for is completely unreasonable and is all about his anxiety, not your daughter's well being. A much better solution is for both of you to research what kinds of foods present the most serious choking hazards for children (grapes are one of them, unsurprisingly) and agree that any foods on that list should either be avoided or chopped up before being served to your daughter. That way, his need to actively do something to prevent a similar tragedy is met, but in a way that actually protects your daughter rather than giving her an unhealthy relationship with food and creating a needless burden on everyone around her.\n\nNAH if Raj accepts this compromise, NTA otherwise. I'm very sorry for his loss.", "People die everyday doing completely normal things. We cannot and frankly, should not try to protect our kids from every possible perceived danger.

You could look into those impossibly make a list of things that they recommend that weren't standard before.\nI can't tell you how many hot dogs I sucked down as a toddler.  Only to hear nowadays they say cut them lengthways and that prevents a lot of choking. \n \nAnd I really recommend therapy, like  yesterday.\n\nThere's a thing they don't tell parents about.  It's that when your kids hit the ages that the parent experienced trauma in, it triggers that trauma. And it can really send it spiraling\n\nHad this when my kiddo turned eight.

It sounds like his earlier therapy may have not really gotten him to a place where he can cope. There's a big difference between not swallowing giant pieces of food whole and taking a minute or more to chew every bite of soft food. Unless Maya is silent during her lunch break at school, she won't have time to eat her food, and she's going to have a hard time making friends. You can choke on water or broth too; there's no way to protect someone 100%, 100% of the time. I hope Raj gets help; I know he's coming from a place of concern, but he's going to make things difficult for Maya.\n\nedit: word", "NTA\n\nHe needs to calm down regarding this.", "Raj, YTA. If it gives you peace of mind get a lif vac and keep it in your dining area. Donate one to the school. Keep going to therapy and settle down a bit.

And I'm pretty sure her choking on well-chewed food in an event where neither of you could help her will send Raj to a much darker place.\n\nAlso, it's more useful to make sure she isn't stuffing too much in her mouth at once. So, yah, focus on these two things (and maybe avoid stringy foods like delicious chewy bacon) IMHO will do more than the 35 chews.", "Nobody is an asshole.

I\u2019ve been married to my husband Raj for 10 years and we have a daughter, Maya, who\u2019s 7.\n\nBackground context: Raj\u2019s brother Seth died in a choking accident when he was 7.

It's obvious you both love and care for your daughter.  Raj is projecting his fears onto his daughter (and you).  Thing is, she could be in a car crash, she could have a bad fall, there are hundreds of freak accidents that happen to people - things that are no one's fault.  I think it would be more productive if let's say you take a CPR classes in case something should happen.  Maybe being proactive in life saving measures is better than making that poor child chew her food 35 times -  and at school too?  Can you imagine the kids making fun of her?  All of that nonsense is going to cause more mental damage and stress on that poor child and she will most likely need therapy from it all later in life.  Is that what you want for her?  Please consider going back into therapy Raj, for your sake and your daughters.  Good luck!", "NTA. You are absolutely right.", "If he needs a crutch to make dinner time less stressful, get one of those choking tube remover things i see ads for on YouTube.", "NTA. Raj is in more danger than your daughter. He's going to extremes and becoming fully obsessive. He needs more therapy immediately. You shouldn't let that obsession mess up your child's life.\n\nPlease force Raj to chew each bite 35 times for at least a week so that he can feel just how sustainable such a thing might be.", "NAH. Both parents want the best for their child. Maya\u2019s age is close to her dad\u2019s sibling. This has triggered unresolved guilt and likely grief. It is time for therapy. He needs to process emotions that he suppressed as a child. They\u2019re resurfacing as childhood trauma does.", "NAH, but your husband is incorrect.  I hate to risk furthering his trauma response, but choking accidents can happen with liquids, so even his method is not completely risk-free.  Chewing appropriately for the food is important, but that does not mean every single bite requires chewing 35 times.  It actually sounds like a pretty effective way to induce either an eating disorder or anxiety in the child.  Also, the school doesn't have the staff to monitor every child in this way, so why would yours qualify for special monitoring (without a physical challenge related to chewing and swallowing)?  He needs another round of therapy to deal with the uptick in anxiety and perhaps a conversation with the pediatrician to discuss the safe guidelines for your child's age and development.  As the parent of a young adult, I can assure you that you cannot eliminate risk from your child's life, and even if you could, it would properly prepare them for the shift to adulthood.  Assessing and managing risk to a REASONABLE level (not complete elimination) is a critical skill and instilling it is part of your job as a parent.", "NTA but trauma and healing are not perfectly linear. \nIt's clear your child's age brought on a bit of a resurgence and is a bit of a trigger. I think the best thing would be for Raj to go back to therapy for a bit during this time to discuss coping techniques. Become obsessive and overprotective can be damaging in its own way.", "NTA, there's some major trauma there, and it sounds like counseling would be helpful. \n\nMaybe consider getting Lifevac for peace of mind? Better to pay for one and never have to use it than needing one and not having access to it. Good luck", "You're NTA but Raj definitely is. Your child will develop problems with eating an anxiety because of him. His trauma doesn't make it okay to force his own daughter to suffer through every meal. He's being very selfish and unfair.", "My heart breaks for Raj. \n\nWhat is coming across loud and clear is that Raj has an unhappy (understandably so) relationship with food. It might be an idea that both Raj, yourself and your daughter relearn how to do meals together. Make mealtimes relaxed and fun. It will take some work, but the less pressure on rules and restrictions, the better. Hopefully, over time Raj will relax his stance and this can be a fun, bonding experience. \n\nReplace bad memories with good ones.\n\nWe can never eliminate all risk in life, unfortunately but we can pave our own paths.\n\nNAH", "NTA\u2014Time for more therapy with Raj. Otherwise he\u2019ll be unnecessarily smothering your daughter with his trauma. Best of luck!", "NAH\n\nRaj, bestie, I know that event must have been terrible for you. Unfortunately, being this strict with your daughter will not help her, it will probably harm her. The whole sending a note to school thing is extremely over the top. Not to mention super detrimental to your daughter 'reputation' (possible teasing at school.) I would say just make sure she is properly chewing and not eating fast and she should be ok. Do not let past tragedies tarnish the future.", "This is mentally illness. I'm sorry for your trauma. Yta, raj.

Even in various languages.", "Raj, I understand you've got trauma relating to your brothers death but micromanaging your daughters eating habits isn't the way to go about it. It's likely to give her an eating disorder in the future actually. I highly recommend you look into therapy to overcome this. What you're asking for is unreasonable. \n\nOP NTA", "I hesitate to call Raj the asshole here as his trauma is absolutely legit, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he is proactively doing enough to manage that trauma and is trying to push off managing it into your 7-year-old child, which is in fact asshole-ish behavior. It sounds like he would greatly benefit from intensive therapy\u2014if he\u2019s currently working with a therapist, clearly he needs to up the frequency of his sessions.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend you get a LifeVac or a similar tool. It\u2019s $70, and might help lessen his anxiety. The company has a warranty that provides a replacement if you do end up having to use it. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA because while his trauma is an explanation for his behavior it does not excuse his refusal to act reasonably.", "Hm. Yeah, I wouldn't enforce it either. \n\nWhen I was younger, I would eat meals pretty quick, so my mom would watch me and ask if I had chewed something at least 30 times before I swallowed. It ended up making me chew even faster so I wouldn't take forever per bite (which then she tried to set a time limit per bite), and it made me resent mealtimes with my mom hanging over my shoulder. I still struggle with pacing myself sometimes even today.\n\nOfc, not the same situation, but if there isn't any severe concern that Maya has difficulty chewing her food or that she predisposed to eating vigorously enough to choke, I feel like such a restriction or \"general rule\" would only harm her.", "You are going to give your child an eating disorder and fear of food. That will impact her life forever and is no way to live. Raj, you need more therapy.", "Ex-choker here--used to choke on EVERY meal as a kid.\n\nI chew thoroughly. Trust me, the trauma's still there after 60 years. How many times do I chew each thing? No freakin' clue.  Enough. Enough to know if I choke it's something weird, not because I didn't chew enough.\n\nRaj, mellow out before you  curse your daughter to a weird eating disorder. It sucks enough trying to eat.", "NTA (OP)that was an incredibly traumatic event. I hope he is still getting therapy since it is affecting him so. (Raj- sorry dude y-t-a)\n\nBeing that controlling over your child will just cause harm. Either increased defiance because her friends don\u2019t have stupid rules like that or perhaps an eating disorder (I was a picky eater as a child, I would have refused to eat sometimes with that rule).", "NTA He is.

He says it\u2019s different because he\u2019s an adult and he knows better than a child on when food can be swallowed, so it\u2019s better to make her follow a general rule.", "And mandatory chewing sounds like a great way to give your daughter an eating disorder. Chewing for that long would result in a food aversion or just throwing up. Get therapy and let your kid eat in peace.", "Not to mention causing issues around food can develop into eating disorders. A lot of people with eating disorders have rules around how much they need to chew food: e.g. \"I can only swallow this mouthful when I have chewed it 50 times.\"\n\nThe more rules you impose around food, the more you treat food like an issues, the more likely you are to create disordered eating behaviours, especially for girls and young women who are already bombarded with messages relating to diet culture and body image.", "So glad to hear that you've taken the courses.\n\nIt does sound like Raj still is struggling with his past trauma that is re-surfacing now that your daughter is the same age as Seth was when he passed.  Surely therapy/counselling might be helpful.", "Well, he can try doing it for one week and then we can talk further.", "And what about fully capable fully functioning adults who choke? It happens. We don't know the situation surrounding his brother and what happened. Sometimes the throat just doesn't work properly to allow food to be swallowed. Doesn't matter how many times you chew the food, if the throat isn't going to work in that moment, you can choke.

He isn't. *You* are right, OP: this is not sustainable, and it's likely to cause other significant problems that matter to you to protect Maya from, even while it is very slightly reducing the risk of choking.\n\nRaj, I had a similar concept to deal with recently, but one which is a little more obvious to see, so let me tell you about it. My teenaged son is going to Europe this summer, on a group educational program. It's a ten hour flight from our home airport. \n\nOur family is intensely cautious, even now, about Covid. We are all multiply vaccinated, and so the odds of any of us dying from it are fairly low, but Long Covid is a monster that ruins lives. I can't even begin to think of my beautiful, bright son whose life is really just getting started, cut off from most of the things I know he wants most by a disability which resembles my own. \n\nI have severe fibromyalgia. I know how limited my own life has been because of my disease. I managed to make a life, of sorts, but it's very limited. If my son gets Long Covid, his life will resemble mine pretty closely. I don't want even to think about that, let alone to risk it. \n\nAnd so my son wears masks any time he's indoors with people who are not our immediate family. So do the rest of us in my household. He doesn't mind; he understands that there are still real risks despite the number of government agencies which have yielded to politics and declared the pandemic to be over. \n\nThe problem is this upcoming flight. A ten hour flight plus airport time and transit to/from the airport at both ends is about 15 hours. And he *cannot* safely go for ten hours in a dry environment without eating or drinking due to the mask. This isn't guesswork -- we're Jewish, and so we fast fully (no food or water for up to 24 hours if your health can handle it) a few times every year. We know *exactly* how long he can fast before he begins to get dizzy and nauseous and risks passing out. Not as long as this. \n\nAnd so, despite my own -- truly rational! -- fears about his catching Covid and developing Long Covid from it, I daren't tell him to maintain strict mask discipline throughout the entire time on the plane. If I go too far to protect him from the problem that I am personally most afraid of, I won't go far *enough* to protect him from something else. \n\nYou and your daughter are in the same position. If you do truly *everything* in your power to protect your daughter from choking, you're going to run much higher risks of other problems that are important to protect her from at all. The risk of falling severely behind in school because of how much time she's spending chewing her meals, both at lunch and at home, for instance. Or the risk of her suffering significant mental health troubles due to the obsessive pressure (and the likely social ostracism that follows).\n\nSo, like me, you need to find a compromise -- a way to protect your child *mostly*, keep them safe enough that you can't do better without messing up something else for them pretty badly in the process. It's hard! But we don't have a choice... parenting involves keeping track of so *many* factors that are necessary to keep your child safe and thriving. If you focus passionately on the specific one that frighten you, you won't be able to focus with equal care on the others. \n\nRaj, I went into this saying NAH, but that's only because I know you really don't mean to harm your child.
