And that she should get therapy to get past this because it\u2019s been years and she needs to get over herself- she obviously has another spouse she gets to say nothing at all about her EX husband\u2019s romantic choices.\n\nFact is your mother is controlling, tremendously insecure and extremely self centered. Not everything is about her issues. Bessy sounds lovely which your dad deserves after having to deal with your selfish mother for goodness knows how long. \n\nNTA but your mom? Boy howdy do I not envy you and your sibs! Congratulations to your sister/family on the new addition!", "NTA.  Do what she's asked:  stop being her daughter.  Go NC.  Block her on everything.  How funny that your mother, who remarried a year after her divorce, is bitter about someone your dad has a relationship with YEARS after the divorce.", "NTA - Your mother needs therapy. This is not appropriate or normal behavior and if this is how she acts you all need to limit contact with her until she learns how to behave appropriately", "NTA! Your mom wants to see your dad alone & control your lives, while she keeps getting to do whatever without any consequences", "Certainly NTA. Your mother seems to either have a past issue with Bessy, or she relished the fact that your father never seemed to get over her. Either way, it takes a real asshole to selfishly make somebody else's event all about herself.", "NTA. Your mom sounds unhinged. I mean, she gets to move on with her life and bring her new husband around but your father can't? Not only that, but she makes your sister's party\u2014where people are supposed to celebrate bringing a new person into the family\u2014and turns it into a day of hatred and exclusion. Who does this?", "NTA, your mother really needs to get over the divorce and accept that there will be other people in your lives because your dad is having girlfriends. She is perfectly ok with you accepting her new husband, so she should extend that courtesy to your father's girlfriends. And if she cannot, then she stands to loose her two daughter, because really, she is being way out of line!", "NTA, you hit the nail on the the head they day was about your sister and her pregnancy not your moms personal view. Your dad and you and your sister are adults and make decisions independently of your mom. Yes she your mom but your mom obviously need some therapy to get over herself she clearly thinks she the most important person in all your lives and therefore can dictate how you live. If anyone should get an apology it should be your sister and it should come from your mom, she should also apologies to \u201cBessy\u201d you did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't choosing sides. You were trying to keep your mother from ruining your sister's baby shower. None of her behavior was necessary or justified. Does your mother not realize the absolute hypocrisy of throwing a fit at your dad's girlfriend being there, when your mom is bringing her WHOLE ASS HUSBAND? \n\nBessy sounds sweet. Your mom sounds unhinged.", "NTA your Mom is though.", "NTA. Unless she\u2019s still married to your dad, she has no business s***ting in everyone else\u2019s Cheerios.", "NTA. Your mom needs to get over your dad and her husband needs to question why his wife is still so hung up on her ex.", "NTA \n\nYour mother made the baby shower all about her!\n\nShe is married to someone else. How does the husband feel that his wife is still jealous of her exes girlfriend? \n\nYour mother is acting like a spoilt child. \n\nI think you and your siblings should go low contact for a while. Let her think about her actions", "NTA but your mother is extremely toxic. Poor Bessy. I'd be so ashamed and angry at my mother for that behavior and honestly wouldn't invite her to any more events until she could prove that she was a grown up. Shame on your dad for not defending Bessy as well.", "NTA. Definitely your mom was in the wrong here. Don't get sucked into it.", "NTA, and your mother is way out of line. It wasn't about Mom and she stole your sister's baby shower and made it about here (Mom). The fact that your Mom became aggressive and assaulted Bessy with the cake is ridiculous. Your sister may want to reevaluate how much contact she has with your mother. I don't understand your Mother because there are no sides here. Your mother remarried. I hope you and your sister can set some healthy boundaries with your mother.", "Its sad that your mother decided to let her anger at your father's gf ruin her own daughter's baby shower.", "YNTA. Not even close! What an absurd reaction. Your mother made the day about her, and it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but her own that her day was ruined. You stuck up for your sister, on her day, and stuck up for Bessy, who your sister wanted to be there. Good on you.\n\nNow to have your mother say she doesn\u2019t want you to be her daughter\u2026 What the actual fuck?! Your mother is definitely TA!", "NTA. I'd love to know what your Moms problem with Bessy is - probably just doesn't like seeing your Dad happy with another woman", "NTA. Your mom is off the rails. That's absolutely nuts. Does the fact that she got remarried mean it's okay for your stepdad to be there but your dad can't have a girlfriend? Speaking of disowning, she's lucky if your sister doesn't disown her after that madness.", "NTA - Your mom is power trippin'. Everyone is capable of being civil and supporting your sister except your mom. She can marry and create a new life and spout lies and negativity into your lives. This is not fair.  This is not what decent humans do. She wants to control the family and views her opinions are right; she is wrong.", "You weren't siding with Bessy, because there was no Bessy's side. This wasn't a conflict between your mom and her; it was your mom having a temper tantrum that she had to share your sister's with other people. NTA.", "You're NTA but your mother sure is a piece of work. I'm surprised her husband is okay with her inappropriately outrageous jealous behavior. Why does she care so much who her long time ex is dating? Especially since Bessy had nothing to do with the divorce and your mom had been remarried for years", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
