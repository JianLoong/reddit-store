{"id": 23396, "submission_id": "15cqagj", "title": "AITA for announcing my wife's second pregnancy in front of my sister who cannot have kids and asked for my money to help pay for her IVF?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a 3 year old son and we're expecting our second child next year. Both our children were conceived via IVF. We spent years trying for our first with no success and it took 4 cycles of IVF to have him. It was brutal on my wife. But we both felt like trying for biological children was the way to go for us. We tried naturally for a second child after our first turned 1 but had zero luck. We were left with the money for one cycle of IVF which we decided to pursue if we didn't have any luck naturally, which we didn't.\n\nAround a year ago my wife and I were gearing up to start the ball rolling on our IVF journey when my sister came and asked if she could have the money to try IVF herself. My sister has no bio kids but does have an 11 year old stepson. She has endometriosis and PCOS and has never been able to have a child. Her stepson is not very close to her and they've had problems with him since the start of their marriage. Her stepson has always brought up the fact his dad married again too soon after his mom died and how my sister is trying to replace her. He ran away from home three times already. They also had the police and CPS on their door because he tried to get removed from their care. Our main reason for saying no is we wanted to give our son a sibling. But I can't lie and say that the dynamic in her home was on my mind too. And I wasn't sure it was a good idea to bring a new baby into their home when things are as bad as they are. She was very upset with me for turning her down. She said she has no kids and we already have one and we'd give her a chance if we gave her the money. I shut her down. I told her my answer was no and it was final.\n\nWe waited for my wife to be far enough along before announcing our last IVF cycle worked. We did this at a family dinner. Everyone was so happy for us except for my sister and her husband. She started making snarky comments about how it was no big deal when we already had a kid. I told her given our struggles it was a big deal. Our parents told her she should be happy for us. She then starts ranting and raving about how selfish we are to deny her motherhood and to deny her and her husband the chance to have a family together. Our other sister pointed out about her stepson. She told her she's not his mother and he hates her guts so it's not like she'll ever get any joy out of mothering him. I told her I was sorry she could not have a kid of her own but she didn't get to demand we sacrifice a second child for her. She then told me I held her stepson against her. I told her I couldn't say that it hadn't crossed my mind that bringing a child into what is already a complicated mess would be a bad idea. But that it was beside the point because we wanted another child. She told me I was an asshole for humiliating her in front of the whole family and picking a fight with her. I told her she picked the fight, not me.\n\nBut I did engage so AITA?", "created_utc": 1690631112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cqagj/aita_for_announcing_my_wifes_second_pregnancy_in/", "score": 8383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your money, end of story. Why does she feel so entitled to it?", "Even if OP did not want another child, she has no reason to fund SIL IVF. The dynamic of the SIL family is very bad!!!!!", "NTA.\n\nLook, the IVF cycle wasn't hers to use. You paid for it. It was your money. I won't claim shouldn't be trying for a kid if she can't afford IVF to begin with. I know it's ridiculously expensive in some places. But. It. Was. YOURS. The fact that you should give up on a second child just because she's desperate to have her first child which is genuinely hers... That's just not okay. Even if you were rich and could pay for her to have the full ride... It still wouldn't be fair for her to expect you to do it. Not her money. That, and your worries are reasonable.\n\nThe only thing you might have been able to do better is telling her in private, earlier, but that's not really why she's angry with you. The public announcement is nothing but more oil on the fire.", "NTA. You didn't \"deny\" your sister anything; She's not entitled to your money. If IVF is something she is interested in, she and her husband can figure out ways to raise the funds, they should not expect to be handed them.", "NTA. Your sister doesn't get to dictate what you do with your money. If you want a second, third, or eighth child that is your business, not hers. She needs to improve her financial and home situation first. And... Who's to say the IVF would have worked for her anyway?", "NTA\n\nShe's expecting you to just fork over thousands of dollars to her.  That's a lot of money that you worked hard to earn.  You're not denying her a child, you're not funding her IVF.  \n\nWhy exactly can't she do something to get that money herself?  Can't she get a job or second job, post a GoFundMe, or take some sort of initiative on her own to get what she wants?  It's not your responsibility to just give her the money.  It's not your responsibility to provide her IVF treatment.\n\nInfertility is a sensitive subject, but you're not being unkind by not funding her IVF.  You're struggling through it yourself.  You get to spend your money in what you want to with that.  She's too emotionally wrapped up in her struggles that she isn't thinking about anything else.  Just expects you to pay and it's jealous when you don't.  There is no justification for taking her jealousy out on you.\n\nAnyone who expects free money from someone else and then gets upset when they don't get it is spoiled and unrealistic.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations! The situation is what it is so I don\u2019t think there was ever going to be a perfect time or way to announce a pregnancy. Not like you could hide it forever. \n\n\u201cDeny her motherhood\u201d .... That is absolutely ridiculous statement. How is them having children on you? There were no guarantees that your sister would ever get pregnant if you gave her the money. If it meant so much to both of them, no one was stopping them from saving their own money for IVF. Did stepson hear this entire conversation? How terrible for that kid.", "You're NTA. \n\n>She then starts ranting and raving about how selfish we are to deny her motherhood and to deny her and her husband the chance to have a family together. \n\nWould the clinic not accept *her money* if she and her husband took the initiative to get second jobs or take out a loan?\n\n\n>She started making snarky comments about how it was no big deal when we already had a kid.\n\nThere is already a child in her household, too. It's easy to see why he feels the way he does about her, since she clearly discounts his existence.

The only thing having a baby will bring is more resentment from the step son.", "NTA. She's not entitled to your money. If she can't afford IVF, she should not be having kids. Also NTA for announcing pregnancy during family dinner. You shouldn't have to walk around egg shells just because she can't get pregnant and can't afford IVF.

Congrats on your new addition OP", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to your money. I think she\u2019s also stuck on the fact that she thinks that IVF will work on the first try.

She\u2019s the AH for demanding and then picking a fight.", "NTA if she wants to do IVF she should use her own money for it how you use your own money is none of her business", "Whoa she\u2019s got some nerve and balls, asking for that kind of  money when most parents know what IVF is and it has a very low % it won\u2019t work the first time. That blows my mind. And having a child this isn\u2019t a bag of groceries.NTA", "NTA- where does it end? If you did give her the money and you are in the US, does she have health insurance? If not, were you supposed to pay for the delivery and any medical costs of pregnancy too?", "NTA. \n\nNasty woman who is intruding upon and creating chaos in an innocent boy's life - she'd be a terrible mother if she ever had her own and she'd use it to turn her useless husband against his own son even more. He's already proven to be a terrible parent by allowing your sister to ruin his child's life so much he's running away and begging CPS to put him in foster care.", "NTA. I don't think your sis' situation is your business. She can try whatever she or her husband will pay for. But your saved money for your own child is yours, so don't give away your and your wife hopes. Best luck!", "NTA\n\nIt's your money. Even if you spent it on some jet skis or a fancy holiday, she's not at all entitled to it. Even if you were super wealthy and could afford it, she's not entitled to it.\n\nThe fact you needed it for something \"valid\" just strengthens your side of the argument, but even if you didn't you'd still be in the right. Your family, and having your own kid, is your priority and it's ridiculous to ask for you to sacrifice that. Even if you'd had two, three or seven kids if you want more and have the money for it the sister's situation should not even be a factor in your decision making process.\n\nMoreover, she acted childish and jealous at the family function when she should have been happy for you and you can't be expected to just sit there and take it without retaliating, even so you kept your cool and what you said was true and fair.", "I had written out a whole E S H response but the truth is there isn\u2019t really a way to handle this type of announcement without your sister being upset. \n\nNTA. She\u2019s aware of your struggle to conceive and expects you to sacrifice your family for hers. She\u2019s dealing with some difficult stuff but it\u2019s unfair of her to take that out on you.", "NTA, why does sister feel entitled to OP's money is beyond me. I'd get it if she was requesting a loan but to outright demand the money is something else.", "NTA IVF is extremely expensive your sister is very entitled to demand that much money from a sibling. Your own family journey shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed for her that\u2019s not reasonable. Even if she manages to raise the sum odds of IVF working the first cycle are unlikely. It coy r suggested they look into other options such as adoption however as mentioned in the post the household dynamics don\u2019t sound great for a small child.", "NTA. But why is this fight is even happening?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou both deserve children and all the IVF you can have. Are those the last money in your family and no one ever will gain any?

Why he wont put money aside for a procedure then?\n\nWhy are you even arguing about who deserves a child more", "NTA, your sister thinks she's entitled to your money", "NTA.\nI'm not judging her for her feelings, because I can't understand what she's going through, but she has zero rights on your money.\nI can also understand your reaction, especially because you and your wife went through the same hell and can't stop live your life for something thats not your fault.\nMaybe you could have refrain from talking about her stepson, but I totally agree that her family dynamic is horrible and bring another child in it, would only make things worse. But it's her family so she can do what she see fit.\n\nFor you, I suggest you let her cool down and see if she'll reach out to you. If she continue to harrass your family with the money request, then going LC/NC would be the best option. Your wife is pregnant and doesn't need to be stressed about this.\n\nOh, and congrats for the pregnancy!", "NTA - you are not responsible for her own fertility struggles. She sounds incredibly desperate, urged on by a negative relationship with her stepson. She needs to seek counseling and find another path to motherhood.

She probably wants a kid just as desperately as you do. IVF may be her only chance and it's bloody expensive. I'd have given her at least part of the money. And if my parents had had me and then thought about trying for my sister but had a relative who was struggling, I'd have wanted them to help out if they could (I'm a twin we're both IVF no we are not identical). \n\nYou cannot judge by her issues with her stepson because he's a STEPson so probably has a lot of background with his bio parents and their divorce that you don't know about. His acting up is unlikely to be her doing. He's not her kid and never will be.\n\nNTA for announcing it but kids aren't a right and having already had one it would have been nice if you weren't so judgemental about her step kid and loaned her at least some money towards having her own baby, knowing how difficult it was for you and for anyone who wants kids but can't.\n\nAnd for the record, make sure your kids know how they were conceived.

That is one entitled sister. I know dealing with infertility is difficult, but to expect others to pay for your IVF and mad when they don\u2019t is awful.

However, it sounds like the stepson hasn't been given the grace to grieve his loss and needs some counseling. Perhaps the dad has a bit to do with the kids behavior as well. \n\nInfertility is tough. It's heartbreaking and so her being upset is normal. It's also hard because often those struggling feel like something is wrong with them. She also needs counseling to work through everything she is going through. \n\nYou already realize you should have just tried to not engage the conversation, but sometimes being human means you finally have had enough and stand up for yourself. \n\nI would let her be. Unless she wants to fix the relationship, she is going to constantly blame you for her troubles. I know it's hard, my ex sis in law also had infertility issues. She didn't go the ivf route and opted to just decide she hates kids. She got more bitter over time, and even less loving towards our children, then gets offended when they don't have a relationship with her. (They had money to try many ways to have kids so we didn't have the money issue) it's hard to let go of family bonds, but there was nothing we could do to make it right.

Not your fault she didnt feel like saving up her own money.", "NTA at all. I sympathise with your sister, not being able to have a child (and although she has a stepson, he clearly doesn't want her to have a mother role). More than anything, I have always wanted to be a mum. When talking about my \"career\" at the end of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, other than be a mum.\n\nWell. Life had other plans. I look at my situation and health, and am pretty sure there's no way I could handle a child, which devastated me. I also don't know how or if I would handle pregnancy.\n\nMy sister then got pregnant, and it was so, so painful. I kept a distance between us, because I was so jealous and heartbroken. However, then the baby was born, and a short while after, there was a bit of a crisis, and I helped out looking after bub. I couldn't help myself, and ended up falling in love with him. I told my sister that I really wanted to be an involved aunt, and I now play an active role in his life.\n\nBeing a part of his life and watching him grow up has been incredibly healing. I get to love a child, but I don't have to go through the hard parts of parenting. Sure, the tantrums and misbehaviour will come, but I'll get lots of time off from that! I don't have to deal with a mealtime battles, or toilet training, or waking up at all hours. I don't have to deal with day to day drama at school, or constantly having a moody teenager around the house, yelling that they hate me. I can handle some of it, but at the end of the day, the main responsibility doesn't lie on me. I get to hand him back.\n\nSeeing the difficulties has made me even more convinced that kids just aren't in my future. Am I sad about that? Yes. But I'm not devastated anymore. I have a little munchkin that I adore, and while I'm not his mum, that's okay. I love him to pieces.\n\nOP, I wish your sister could find it in herself to have this type of relationship with your children. Unfortunately, it has to come from her, and it doesn't sound like she's there yet. I hope she will be one day, but in the meantime, it's not selfish of you at all to use IVF for yourselves and have another child. Congratulations, by the way! I hope everything goes smoothly \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc76", "NTA. It was your money to spend as you wanted, not hers.

IVF is a LOT of money. Most people couldn\u2019t just casually toss over some money to pay for someone else\u2019s treatment.

I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking someone for that. \n\nThe fact is you had to try 4 times for your first child, and you got really lucky that it worked from one cycle the second time because if I\u2019m reading it right, you only had the money for one more go. Why does she feel entitled to take that one last chance away from you? It\u2019s your money and your lives. Spending your money on having another child of your own is VERY different than spending it on someone else having one. She is not entitled to your money, period. You didn\u2019t deny her anything because it wasn\u2019t hers to demand in the first place. \n\nThe audacity and entitlement of some people is incredible. Her medical issues are not your problem to address. Her inability to bond with her stepson is also not your problem to address.

She is definitely also an AH for taking her pain and disappointment out on you and your wife, though. Maybe your parents could have a talk with her and offer her some financial support for therapy or something - whether individual or familial.

It\u2019s no guarantee that she\u2019ll be able to conceive or carry to term, but it might help her. I have stage 4 endo and it has caused so much damage that I have to have surgery to remove my uterus and both tubes, and likely part of my ovaries. I was never able to get pregnant and I never will, and it\u2019s such a difficult thing to deal with, especially when it seems like everyone you know is having babies. If my original doctor had addressed my endo years earlier, instead of just \u201cmonitoring\u201d it, there\u2019s a good chance I could have had a child, but that\u2019s not the way it worked out for me. \nAnyway, perhaps your sister should see a therapist to deal with the grief and trauma she\u2019s going through with endo & infertility, and look for an endo specialist who can remove the full endo growths, not just laser the top layer of the growth. \nNone of her issues are your fault and you shouldn\u2019t be held responsible (financially, or emotionally) for a medical condition your sister has that even doctors don\u2019t really know much about (they don\u2019t really teach about endo in med school, even for gyns ).

Again, this may not be an option depending on where they live and the kinds of work they do, but when we had our daughter, there were plenty of companies that provided funds for IVF as part of the benefits package.

IVF can cost tens of thousands of dollars at once - my kid is definitely expensive, but I haven\u2019t had to shell out 30 grand for her in one go (yet). I\u2019m not able to afford IVF without financial assistance, but I can absolutely afford the day to day costs of my child. Perhaps it would be ideal for OP\u2019s sister and her husband to take a few years and save up for IVF, or get a part time job that offers fertility benefits (Starbucks and Tractor Supply come to mind), but OP didn\u2019t mention ages, so his sister might not have the time to do that. \n\nIVF is recommended for people with PCOS and Endometriosis. Some people with PCOS and Endometriosis can get pregnant without fertility treatments, many require extra help.

Or worse, you\u2019ll get on the plane, land on the tarmac, and told you didn\u2019t actually go anywhere. Or worse still, you\u2019ll go, and make it, and once you\u2019re in the gates, told to turn around and go home. \n\nNo refunds.", "Go to europe chech Republic is cheap.. Source 10 years of ivf.

You, nor others, can control your body! And if there is anyone not happy for you?

I sometimes feel like I didn't do \"real\" IVF because it was really straight forward and worked first round. My husband had prostate cancer so we froze sperm before his surgery but no other fertility issues.", "The word \"rehoming\" when referring to children makes me shutter. I can't believe people actually re-home children like some puppy or kitten.", "Two embryo transfers aside, identical twins are also statistically higher with IVF if ICSI is used as the insertion point can create a cleave point for the dividing cells to split off. ETA: I said point a lot.", "People who do this should be under a jail somewhere.", "That's quite a recent and not universal practice. Until not too long ago the general consensus was to maximise probability of pregnancy by transferring multiples. I'm jot sure if it's the only factor but the occurrence of multiple pregnancy in the general population is ~2% while with IVF it has been around 9-12%, with the age of the mother accounting for the range.", "... I hate that I read that as 17 factorial. That's so many lol."]}
