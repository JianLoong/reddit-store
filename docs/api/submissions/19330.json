Assuming this isn't a bait post, it's really odd that an adult would find themselves in this situation, let alone not realise they're being the asshole.\n\nAs adults we frequently make sacrifices for the people we love. Sometimes that can mean not getting all the sleep we might want to get, or having to stay late at work to make up for time we gave to someone else. We don't do these things because we necessarily enjoy missing sleep or working late, but because we care about the people we choose to surround ourselves with.\n\nYou can choose to be alone and undisrupted, or you can choose to have people in your life like family and partners and learn to make small sacrifices for them. Think about this, the bad outcome you worried about, maybe sleeping a little less and maybe staying a little late at work one day, how does that compare to the good in that situation of helping someone you love in a stressful and upsetting time. Think about the good you could have brought to your partners life vs the frankly tiny inconvenience to you, and then probably try to be less of a selfish chode to your next partner, because your current one should definitely be reconsidering things.", "absolutely an asshole. i can\u2019t even imagine how traumatizing the situation must have been.\n\nand you chose not to be there.

On a relationship note you just showed your former girlfriend very clearly through your actions that you cannot be counted on in an emergency.

Seriously? \n\nOn a dog ownership note\u2026 I\u2019m a former dog trainer/obedience instructor, worked a great deal with local rescues including assisting handling dogs and cats coming in to be assessed by their vet on staff. I can attest from plentiful firsthand experience that dog attacks are NO joke and it\u2019s absolutely an emergency to get them in for a check over, even if it doesn\u2019t look \u201cthat bad\u201d. \n\nWe had a dog training client with very sweet little black Spaniel who was attacked by the neighbor\u2019s Shepherd mix. The Spaniel was stoic seeming, not making a noise\u2026 just wagging her tail slightly when spoken to (in shock) and externally there were just a few puncture wounds and wasn\u2019t even bleeding much visibly. \n\nI had a bad feeling after seeing her dog and ended up driving with the owner to the emergency vet as she needed support. That little Spaniel that \u201clooked fine\u201d had two fractured ribs that had lacerated internal organs and was bleeding out internally. She wouldn\u2019t have made it if her owner followed the wait and see approach, wouldn\u2019t have survived if they\u2019d waited even an hour later. She barely survived as it was. \n\nWherever you work, you clearly aren\u2019t a veterinarian or working in adjacent animal fields. Don\u2019t give medical advice or recommendations of things to try in an emergency situation when you obviously have NO idea what you are talking about. That advice you gave and those alternatives that didn\u2019t pan out wasted valuable time with your girlfriend\u2019s loved family member suffering in the meantime.

Definitely not.", "Right, he showed her she can't count on him to be there for her. Maybe he'll do better with the next girlfriend.", "yeah he says the vet is hour away, but the hour is only 5?\n\n5+1+1=7? the math doesn't add up", "Someone had agreed with me until my misogyny, the start of my argument was how hard completing a 2 hour drive in 3 hours would be.", "It\u2019s 50/50 if reddit will downvote it even if it has one.", "sarcasm\n/\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0kaz(\u0259)m/\nnoun\nthe use of irony to mock or convey contempt.\n\"she didn't like the note of sarcasm in his voice\"", "I don't think people unsarcastically say \"the nerve\" anymore", "I think it was sarcasm\u2026", "They\u2019re clearly being sarcastic.", "Lmfao there\u2019s no way they didn\u2019t say this dripping in sarcasm, I wouldn\u2019t take it literally", "I am worried that the first part made sense as the start of my argument was how hard completing a 2 hour drive in 3 hours would be.", "I think the comment you're replying to is mocking op, and not intended to be taken non-sarcastically", "r/whoooosh", "I appreciate this so much lol", "Like I hate saying anybody is hopeless but *man* if someone's still acting like this at 31 that might just be who they are.", "\"Never\" is a harsh word, even if \"Yet\" may be too optimistic.", "Holy Hell, I didn\u2019t catch his age the first time reading it.

OP just didn't want to take any responsibilities in a relationship. Maybe he should wait a few years till he matures before entering a new relationship", "The real math is 5+1+1+hours waiting on the emergency vet. Still, dude\u2019s an ex boyfriend. YTA"]}
