If I were one of them, I'd have dumped you from the trip before allowing the other two friends to walk away.", "YTA. No question. \n\n\nNo, he does not have every right to come just because he is your BF.

Maybe they want to just spend time with YOU without him and you just ruined it, probably not for the first time.", "YTA. No, your boyfriend doesn\u2019t have every right to come on a girls trip. I hope the rest of the girls drop out and schedule their own trip without you.", "YTA for inviting guys to a girls trip for starters.

Your friends are pretty clear that this was meant to be a fun girls trip just for you guys. Your boyfriend and you had a conversation where he wanted to go so you let him without checking how anyone else would feel. It wasn\u2019t your call seeing as how you didn\u2019t plan it and now he\u2019s bringing his friends when none of them get along with your friends.

Obviously. \n\nSomeone invited you on a girls\u2019 trip, and then you invited your boyfriend. this is pretty clear. Lol", "Yta. You're going to ruin a trip that can potentially link you to a life long friend or friends with huge memories over a guy you won't be with in a few years. You're being thoughtless. Obviously it was a Girl's only trip. The fact that people don't like your boyfriend says a lot and the fact that you don't even care says a lot about you. I dont know if you are with an immature jealous boy and he's making you think it's ok for him to book a hotel by you or you just want to go on a vacation with him. Either way, you should cancel out on your girl trip and just stay with him.

The fact that your bf is coming along is a big red flag, he sounds controlling.  Finally, if all your gf's don't like him, it is time to figure out what they are seeing that you are love blind to.  Some big RED FLAGS are flying!", "YTA. This was something you should have run by your friends before making the decision yourself.

But you drop out of the one with your friends.", "YTA.  It's a GIRL trip.  None of your friends like him, why?  You also got a bit of revenge on your friends by inviting him along.  Your \"It's not fair they don't like him\" gave that away.", "YTA. You absolutely should have communicated to your friends that you were interested in inviting your boyfriend along before just pulling the trigger on the decision.

This was a girls trip and you invited your bf without consideration of the others who planned the trip.

You schedule a girls trip and then assume it is OK to invite your BF without asking how the group feels about it and your excuse was \"he's my boyfriend so he has every right to come\".   No.  He has every right to be your BF.

You absolutely have to ask the organizer before getting your own friends\nB) Even if you did collectively organize it with the rest of the girls, everyone then has a right to decide if any additional people can be added.\nC) Isnt it kind of unhealthy that your boyfriend was concerned about not being invited to come?

You can't make a decision inviting someone on a trip and not include the other attendees. On top of that you know that your BF and your friends don't get along so they wouldn't want him around, but even if they did get along this was supposed to be a GIRLs trip.", "So,\n\nYou decided to invite your bf to a holiday with friends without checking with said friend YTA\n\nYou decided to invite your bf to a girls only trip YTA\n\nYou decided to invite one person (by chance it was your boyfriend) to a trip with people that don't like him (regardless of the reason) YTA\n\nBonus: Your boyfriend expressed concerns with you going on a girls trip \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 (he sounds very very toxic, which may well be the reason why your friends don't like him)\n\nIn case it wasn't clear YTA", "YTA.

Your friends have every right to be mad at you if you invited him along.", "YTA and a bad friend for thinking it\u2019d okay to bring a boyfriend along. He\u2019s not inner circle and you already knew that him being there would make the trip less enjoyable for the others.\n\nIt was a self serving decision.", "YTA & so is your boyfriend.\n\nFor everything written in this post.

How would you feel if one of your friends randomly and without permission invited their boyfriend, who you DON\u2019T LIKE!! You nor your boyfriend have NO right to make those moves without their consent.

This was a girls trip, not a couples trip, or a guy/and girl friends trip. You should have run it by the girls before inviting him. Having guys on what was supposed to be a girls trip will completely change the vibe.", "YTA. You\u2019re not going to be invited to another holiday again, you know that, right? I\u2019m not sure what part of girls\u2019 trip you\u2019re kot getting.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re young, and your bf is young so maybe neither of you understands how unhealthy this is. \n\nYour friends don\u2019t like him for a reason. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because he is coming off as clingy and jealous and controlling. \n\nFYI: it\u2019s totally appropriate for you to go on a trip with your friends. He doesn\u2019t have any right whatsoever to push his way into the trip, and he especially doesn\u2019t have that right when his motivation is controlling your actions.", "YTA- you invited your boyfriend on a trip you did not plan, you sound like you did not consult the girls prior to inviting him, and thus completely changed the vibe of the trip. Your friends might have valid reasons they don't like him, as well relationships are about trust, if your Boyfriend has concerns about you being away from him, that could lead to control issues and shows that he doesn't trust you to keep yourself in check or your friends. He should trust you not to do anything that he considers cheating or offensive", "YTA.\nNot only for inviting him to a vacation that you didn't even plan, but for dating someone who's shitty to your friends. \nYou are NOT gonna keep your friends for very long.", "YTA, I can 100% understand why your friends don\u2019t like him, and won\u2019t like you either eventually if you keep this up", "Come on now. Yes, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nNo couple needs to do everything together, even married couples. It's actually good to do things separately with your respective friends. My husband plays Dungeons and Dragons and I don't- I tried it but it's not for me- so last week he went to play DnD with his friends while I did something I enjoy while this weekend we're going to see a play together. \n\nInviting your boyfriend is disrespectful to your friends, and honestly shows insecurity and immaturity within a relationship by treating yourself as a package deal, almost like he's an appendage you can't live without. Being in a relationship doesn't mean you cease to exist as an individual.", "YTA, this was supposed to be a girls\u2019 trip. Even if it weren\u2019t, you should have asked the original group first before you invite anyone. Especially since your friends don\u2019t care for him.

You are not his property and it isn\u2019t his place to decide things on your behalf.

You know you aren\u2019t permanently attached? You can and should do things without him and you were fine with it until your boyfriend said he was concerned. Be careful of this behaviour, it will land you in a mess.", "YTA. 1)it\u2019s not YOUR trip, you didn\u2019t organize it. 2)it was planned as a girls trip. Unless your bf and his friend are identified as women..then if they come it\u2019s not a girls trip 3) your friends do not like him. Regardless of reasons, it\u2019s rude to invite your bf on a trip that is a girls trip, with girls who do not like your bf.\n\nAlso your bf sounds a but controlling. He just decides you aren\u2019t allowed to go without him, books stuff to come whether you like it or not? Run girl run! Might be a reason your friends dont like him.", "Yes. YTA. I don't really understand why you think you wouldn't be.\n\nAlso, you are 17. Take this as a lesson that you are allowed to go on a girls trip whether you have a boyfriend or not. Whether he is uncomfortable with the idea or not.  That is a control tactic. Going forward, don't fall for it.", "Yta this is a learning experience, don\u2019t be a jerk to your friends now that you have a bf because when you break up you\u2019ll want them again. It\u2019s extremely rude to invite an extra person on a trip without getting the group to agree first.", "How has your boyfriend every right to come to a girls trip? That would go against the point. It's ridiculous.\n\nAdding that if I were your friends I wouldn't want your boyfriend on this trip.

You'll learn that's not the case, or you can just believe us and save yourself the AITA? post years from now about his controlling/gaslighting (appropriate use of word here, I promise) behavior.  Why don't you drop out so the others who don't want to be around these two uninvited guests can go w/o having to deal with your selfishness.", "YTA when you are going on a group trip you ASK the group before inviting someone. Your BF is a jerk to your friends and they don't like him because of it. You're 17 so you should learn all of this now.

I told the manager who wasn\u2019t happy. He was fired within a week of working there because he was also stealing the alcohol to drink during his shift. He was caught for that because he told the pregnant coworker not to drink his iced tea because he made it \u201cLong Island style\u201d", "True but yikes. Not my style, that\u2019s for sure", "His concern is, whether or not those couple of months should continue based on the types of things she will OBVIOUSLY be influenced to do in that hostel", "I had a friend who did that. We were really close. I let her live with me, and she started dating her first boyfriend she got that wrapped up that he stayed every night, and they broke up she got another bf same thing but he was the first she was intimate with and he was only her second bf. \n\nShe had him over a lot, which didn't bother me at first, then she would blow off plans with me for him. That didn't bother me till it had happened about 10 times. He was over all the time I thought she had moved him in, I spoke to her and asked if she could only have him over 3 times a week, which I thought was fair after a week of that arrangement she moved out, fine that's up to her then she turned on me and started trying to get money out of me, mutual friends said the bf was manipulating her, I tried to be under standing but I broke and couldn't deal with everything so I was done, we work together and we play on the same sports team, \n\nI will never forget or forgive but I will be civil for work and sport.", "You can call it, every goddamn time. Creeps and bigots don't understand how much their personality SMELLS.", "It doesn't matter whether you \"get it\" or not. The fact is she isn't the one who planned it, it was expected to be just girls and she decided to invite someone else without talking to anyone about it. That's just fucking rude and ABSOLUTELY makes her TA.", "They are both AHs. And hint: your friends are likely to stick around much longer than your bf\u2026 you should choose wisely", "\ud83d\udc80 that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying this in the first place Op needs to drop her friends if they hate her boyfriend that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying Op needs to drop her friends and just go with her boyfriend think what you think that\u2019s you but hey\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Maybe there's a reason why they don't like him that she doesn't see because she's in it. Like I don't know maybe trying to control who she goes on vacation with.\n\nGreat solution to dump the friends so that she's all alone if(sounds to me more like when) he becomes more codependent and/or controlling", "Yeah, but chances are they saw the backlash and immediately logged out of this account. It takes a lot of heat to get 700 dislikes. All we can do now is pretend OPs friends moved on to greener pastures.", "Who knows but we don\u2019t have that information so boyfriend has done nothing wrong so far", "If you can't see that butting in on a trip they had planned for months at the last minute because he doesn't \"like her going without him\" is controlling and wrong then I can't help you, but I guarantee that a majority of people that had someone they don't like imposed on them at the last minute on a trip that THEY planned would feel the exact same way as OP's friends.", "Succinct. YTA.", "Because they don\u2019t like a guy who insults them?", "And everyone knows, girls can\u2019t travel without at least one guy present. He\u2019s helping them out, they should be grateful! :-/  \n\nHis \u201cconcerns\u201d about OP travelling without him would make me concerned about his future behaviour.", "LOL. \"but not in a rude way\" so he uses backhanded compliments or she is just as big of a d-bag as the BF and they deserve each other", "\u201cHe tells them they are flat (and fat) and stuff *but not in a rude way*\u201d!!!!", "And can you imagine being forced to travel with this jackass?! Oh hell no! If I was the organiser, I\u2019d be cancelling the original plans, making a new group chat without OP, and arranging a different trip.", "To be fair you are typing in a British accent which is the most polite of accents", "a genuine 'compliment' my friend's sister gave me:\n\n\"oh you're so pretty, and you have amazing legs, you just need to lose this and you'd be gorgeous!\" \\*proceeds to grab my stomach\\*\n\nlike it was genuinely kinda hurtful, esp when i have huge confidence issues when it comes to my appearance", "Are you the boyfriend?", "Funny I was thinking the exact same thing.", "Hoping that the other girls plan their own 'true' girl's trip, without clingy males.", "My mind immediately jumped to: he\u2019s super possessive. Now OP is in a relationship with him, she can\u2019t go anywhere without him. Maybe even a bit misogynistic too - some kind of \u201cIf I\u2019m not there you\u2019ll cheat on me cos that\u2019s what women are like\u201d nonsense.  \n\nMight be a leap, but the way OP worded it, it doesn\u2019t sound like innocent \u201clet\u2019s spend every second together cos we\u2019re so in love\u201d stuff.", "Yes! Valid", "Hi, autistic person here, I would have known at 17 not to invite my boyfriend on a girls\u2019 trip without asking, hope you realize someday that autism doesn\u2019t mean oblivious.", "How do you NOT say that in a rude way??", ">which is true he does call some of them fat and tells some of them they are flat and stuff but not in a rude way.\u201d\n\nWooow!! OP's still very much in the rose-tinted glasses phase, I see \ud83e\udd23And I suppose her friends are just jealous of her new relationship, too.", "Which is it OP? \"\\[he's rude to them\\] which is true\" ...\"but not in a rude way.\" Like what? Girl needs to pull her head out of her own ass. While it sounds like he is controlling, it sounds like she says this stuff about them too.", "Or if they dare to play video games.", "Hahaha the ungodly STENCH of assholery"]}
