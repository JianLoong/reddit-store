She then turned to my husband and said that he should take a stand. I got very upset and told her that she was an evil and disgusting person and that she was going to rot in hell for the way she thinks and the things that she says. She tried to argue back with me, but I had already turned and left. My husband was right behind me, and our entire ride home was silent and tense. I thought that my husband would fully agree with me but when we got into our bedroom, he said that he understands why I got angry, and he agrees that his mother was 100% wrong and the thing she was saying were messed up but that I shouldn't have said those things to her because she is old, and she was raised to think this way.

She may actually be wrong, but it's hard to argue that when it kinda looks like she's correct.
