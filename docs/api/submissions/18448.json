As long as there\u2019s no abuse, it\u2019s not your business. Honestly, there is a good chance you push your kids away in the long run.", "Info: What makes you think she\u2019s pretending to be nice? Has something occurred to make you think otherwise?", "Can you elaborate on how this woman is pretending to be nice and not actually nice? She sounds lovely from what I just read.", "Your kids can never have too many people in their lives that care about them.\n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from but.... This is a you problem, not a Mallory problem. You have some unresolved emotions about your ex. You should consider dealing with those feelings & don\u2019t include your kids or Mallory in your issues with your ex. \n\nSorry but YTA", "You need to separate the former marriage from your children's future. You are jealous of Mallory and give zero examples of how she is \"pretending \" to be nice to the kids. The kids are the priority here and they deserve a supportive and healthy household in both your home and their fathers home. Suck it up. YTA", "Info: how do you know that Mallory is pretending to be nice? Have you met her? Has she said or done anything to you or your kids that was unkind?", "YTA. You have made up things in your head about this woman. You're making an extreme adjustment because of unfounded assumptions. From what you described you don't trust her because she's too good to be true. You just don't like that there is another woman in your children's lives.", "\nYTA\n\nYou're furious at this woman and your ex for destroying your marriage. That's 100% understandable. But you've got to aim your rage somewhere else. What you can't do, legally or relationally, is stop your kids from forming bonds with her. You aren't allowed to do that by law and, since your kids are going to be living with her half the time, you can't stop them from forming positive relationships.\n\nWhat you can do ...\n\n1) Get a therapist just for you. A place where you can vent your rage and feel all the feels.\n\n2) Ask your kids to stop talking about daddy and Mallory with you. They're old enough to understand that the divorce was hard. Tell them that  hearing about Daddy and Mallory still makes you feel funny so you want them to enjoy their time there but not be part of it.", ">The worst one was a few days ago when my son was saying that Mallory told them she doesn't want kids because she loves her bonus kids so much and wants to just raise them\n\nIf that's the worst one, YTA indeed. Your ex is, of course, the original AH here. And you are playing right into his hands by forcing your kids to choose you over Mallory. Ten years from now, your kids will think, \"Mom is nuts, no wonder Dad left her for awesome Mallory!\"\n\nOr, you could be super supportive of your kids and make it very clear you won't talk bad about their dad or stepmother. They will eventually see that dad was in the wrong.", "YTA. I'm sorry. I know it must hurt. But why do you use the word \"pretending\"? Maybe she just is a really nice stepmom figure for them. \n\nYou're just going to make things worse for everyone if you try to control them. Focus on being the best mom to your kids that you can. Live your own best life. And talk to a therapist about processing your own hurt in a productive way.", "YTA.\n\nBut look on the bright side. It's great that your kids like her. So many times when families split and move on, there is a ton of resentment and tension among the kids, and real difficulty for the stepmom to integrate. Sounds like you have all done a good job so far to avoid that. Dont mess it up now.\n\n(btw she sounds awesome)", "YTA for being so insecure & jealous. It actually is good that your kids get along with her and like her. It\u2019s is healthier for them to have this relationship than terrible tensions with her. So they can see that life goes on for their parents after divorce. You seem hung up on the past, still upset that your marriage ended. Your have that right but taking it out on your kids relationship with their new stepmom isn\u2019t fair to them and only makes you look like a jealous childish shrew. Way to make coparenting about your kids /s", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t see any description of her being fake or not nice to them. Yeah your ex is cruel for divorcing you for a younger model. Yeah she sucked *towards you* for being okay with it, but she isn\u2019t even directly mean to you now, after all this.", "YTA. You're jealous because you got dumped and your kids love the woman that replaced you. YOU are supposed to want what's best for your children, not what soothes your butthurt. You need to just let your kids find out on their own if she's not being truthful with them instead of trying to keep them away from her. If you are right, it will show up because nobody can keep being fake indefinitely. In the meantime get some help dealing with your negativity before it damages your relationship with your kids.", "YTA. \n\nYou're wrapping up your hatred for the affair and what she participated in, bleed into the relationship she has with your kids. \n\nIf your kids' takeaway on Mallory is that she is an amazing and supportive adult in your life, even if she is putting it on to a degree, that is all that matters. She is demonstrating that they have a space in the new family and is making sure they feel welcome in their home and *that* is what matters most. \n\nGently OP, you don't need to forgive what your ex and Mallory did, but you do need to find a way to be a good co-parent. Your kids should not have to find themselves with one very bitter parent who can't find a way to make all their homes safe.", "YTA. You should be thankful that she loves your kids and your kids love her. I love my bonus child like she is mine and the mom would always get so mad. But why? How does that benefit anyone? Get therapy and move on. Just be glad she is good to your kids.", "YTA.. your jealous and it shows. She might be faking or not..you don't know really. It doesn't matter though because the kids think she's awesome and thats all that should matter. Yes being cheated on sucks but your laying all the blame on the wrong person. Your ex CHOSE to cheat..if it was her it would have been someone else. If you've been on reddit for any length of time you've seen the step parent horror stories, be glad she seems to not be one of those ( kids can sense when someone isn't really fond of them). Get some therapy and move on.", "Yes, YTA. Be happy that Mallory seems to like your kids. Your ex is going to have partners, these partners are going to interact with your kids, and no judge in the world is going to be on your side when you say \"Their stepmom is too nice to kids, I don't like that my kids like her, so I want to change the custody so that the kids can see the father and that woman less\".", "I\u2019m pleasantly surprised at how many YTA judgements are in this thread as this sub normally can\u2019t stand step parents. \n\nIt sucks that your husband cheated on you, and this situation is of course deeply unpleasant for you. Your jealousy is completely understandable. \n\nBut YTA if you intentionally keep your kids away from someone they like, hurting them, and creating further issues between you and your ex. The only ones that will truly be hurt by this are your kids, and you\u2019re not going to feel any better about your husband leaving you.", "Changing custody agreements because you resent your husband\u2019s AP/partner is not good. You need to learn how to deal with the lose of your marriage without using the kids as a weapon. Now if the children are with her alone on his custody days that a different story. They are his custody days not hers and he should be there the majority not the time parenting your kids.", "YTA get some therapy. She\u2019s done nothing but be amazing to your children and has done nothing towards them that depicts you negatively. It is normal to be resentful if this type of situation but your behaviour is only going to push your children away. They like her and have no reason not to, she treats them amazingly and that\u2019s all you can ask for from a stepparent or the like.", "You\u2019re jealous because your kids like her? Weirdo. YTA", "Careful, mom, your bitter is showing. And while it is at least understandable, you are going out of your way to paint this woman in a bad light with no substance. She may genuinely be and feel all these things you want to insist she \u201cpretends\u201d. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about sides. Repeat it to yourself until it sinks in. It\u2019s about the kids having healthy environments, at your home and his. You are making your home toxic with the hate you feel. You are trying to make their father\u2019s house toxic with the hate you feel. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about Mallory, or your ex, it\u2019s about you.

You're angry and lashing out. You need to find a way to get over it and move on for your sake and your kids' sake.\n\nHe has found a nice partner who is welcoming and loving towards your kids. Be grateful that he continues to be a present and caring father to the kids. \n\nYour jealousy, pettiness, and anger over the situation don't make you endearing, and your kids are smart enough to notice your behavior. More than likely, this will push the kids away from you and into Mallorys arms. Is that what you want?\n\nThis is the time to work on yourself. Concentrate on your happiness and what you need to do to be happy. Happy for yourself, happy for your kids, and happy for your future.", "YTA. You really don't get to decide that.", "YTA, you are SO jealous of Mallory and it is painfully obvious. Your sons have a positive figure in their life, and you are ripping it away from them to punish your husband and because you're insecure that you're \"less awesome\" than your husband's younger girlfriend.\n\nYou're doing everything wrong when it comes to dealing with kids in a divorce, and when your kids are older, they will resent you for it. They are trying to make the breakup of your marriage into as positive of a situation as possible, and you're shitting all over their efforts.\n\nAnd she may seem to be pretending to be nice to you, but maybe that's just because she fucked your husband and you're bent out of shape about it? Chances are, she genuinely IS nice to your kids while they are around her, and you should be grateful for that. Many people have a bad relationship with their stepparents, and you seem hellbent to use your sons as a weapon to punish both Mallory and your husband.\n\nShe is not making the kids be \"on her side\", and it's kind of gross that you see the situation in those terms.

She willingly slept with a married man.  \n\nLook,  I don't care much about cheating. I'm not vehemently against it like some on here.  I don't think it's good.  I do think you should end a relationship before you start a new one.  I also think that both parties in a cheating scenario,  especially if the AP knew about the marriage,  are at fault. AP didn't accidentally slip and fall under his dick. She got herself there as a fully participating partner.", "She shouldn't have dated a married man", "OP said because she dated a married man.", "Oh 100%\n\nI made another comment saying that she shouldn't be holding her resentment against her kids but against her ex husband and to chanel her hatred to her ex into love for her kids. She needs to be better for them", "Exactly. She is the typical \"go after the homewrecker instead of the one with the commitment to her\". She needs to sit down with both her ex and Mallory and hash it all out as it doesn't seem like Mallory will be leaving and her and her ex have joint custody. \n\nUnderstandably OP's feelings are all over the place however she does not need to get the kids involved in her marital mess", "Ah. Fair enough. Ok. You\u2019re totally right. :-)", "OP isn't exactly a reliable narrator.", "Agreed, if he wasn\u2019t actively looking or hoping for someone else, he certainly had checked out of his marriage enough to cheat. If he were decent he wouldn\u2019t ended the marriage before meeting someone else. He decided to cheat instead and it\u2019s more than likely he would\u2019ve only stayed until he could jump ship. It was probably when, not if. OP is in denial.", "No I don\u2019t agree she needs to be happy for them the couple but the resentment is so obvious that she needs to learn to be happy with herself.", "Either way, she was the affair partner of OP's ex-husband. Hearing the other woman say stuff like that to your kids, and having said kids really like her would hurt anyone's feelings. She's wrong in directing her emotions towards her kids though.", "Either way, she was the affair partner of OP's ex-husband.

It\u2019s a complicated situation that could have been navigated with more grace from everyone, surely.", "Yeah, that's harsh. It's rubbing salt on the wound, for sure. But OP really should really think about how life would be had the other woman been a complete witch to the kids.\n\nIf the comments are really unbearable, she should at least get a therapist to help her express to her kids that their comments hurt in a way that don't make them feel guilty. The 13yo is already old enough to understand, I think. It's better to talk about the hurt gently than explode with no control at some point.", "Well said & wise.", "Really depends on if she knew or not? Th ex could've easily told her that they was already divorced or separated and telling her that op is a jealous ex trying to cause trouble which if that is the case how op is acting really aint gonna help her case.", "That doesn\u2019t = pretending to be good to/for the kids though. \n\nSomeone can be a cheater, while still being a good step parent", "Yeah I\u2019m sick of people pretending that the person who also engages in cheating isn\u2019t also to blame if they were aware of the circumstances. \n\nIf she knew she was actively engaging in behavior that would destroy the family, that\u2019s not exactly the best way to love her bonus kids.\n\nESH. You\u2019re allowed to be upset and not want to hear about it, but if she isn\u2019t doing anything wrong then you need to just keep it to yourself.", "HE is the home wrecker.\n\nWe have NO clue what she did or did not know.   He could have spun her one of a million different stories.  People who cheat on their spouses aren't exactly notorious for their honesty in general.    \n\nBut we know for sure that HE knows he took vows and chose to violate them anyway.", "We really don\u2019t know the whole story about the marriage breakup. Who knows what Mallory was told, or what shape the marriage was in before the affair. I don\u2019t advocate cheating but sometimes I kind of understand why it could happen. \n\nIn any case, OP should be thankful that a stepparent makes her kids feel loved and happy. We see so many stories here about horrible stepparents.", "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a good person. Absolutely not. But *she* didn\u2019t end the marriage. *She* didn\u2019t make him cheat. *She* didn\u2019t cause this. \n\nTypical. Easy to blame the devil woman than to lay the blame at the door of the person who broke their marriage vows.", "Is he doesn\u2019t care why should she? It\u2019s his commitment not hers.", "If it was not her, it would have been another woman", "He shouldn't have cheated.\n\nMaybe you should stop blaming the side piece and blame your husband for having the self control of a toddler and being unable to keep it in his pants.", "it takes two to tango, maybe your ex-husband shouldn\u2019t have dated her?", "The married man shouldn\u2019t have been seeing her. He\u2019s at fault.", "A married man shouldn\u2019t have cheated on his wife.", "Seeing that you \"believe\" that your husband's cheating on you was solely her fault, seeing that you're only blaming the mistress who broke the marriage not the cheater (they both share the blame) do you also blame yourself?\n\nCoz you are giving off misogynistic vibes and have the \"wife is responsible for men cheating coz they're not providing enough to their husband so they don't cheat on you\" mentality.\n\nYTA. It can be hard to forgive them (THEM - as they both wronged you), you can go on not forgiving them at all too if you wish but just don't do anything that can hurt your kids.", "Did she know he was a married man? \n\nIf she did then blame both her and your ex-husband.  If she didn't place the blame where it belongs solely at your ex-husbands feel. \n\nRegardless of how your marriage broke down, where your kids are concerned as long as she treats them right you can't complain, or at least shouldn't. If she's faking then your children will one day see this.  Remain loving and a consistent parent.  Don't slate their dad or his GF to them otherwise they'll think you're the bad one in the dynamic because no matter what he did to you, he's their dad and they love him.  By the sounds of it they also really care about his GF too.", "Apparently OP also said she cheated with her ex- just gets juicer and juicer", "The think the above poster meant the kids.", "If she's been dating this man since before the actual divorce / separation then it's highly unlikely she didn't already know. If she believed he had been divorced already, how could he hide the divorce proceedings from  her? And once you find out your partner lied to you about that, staying with them makes you complicit too. Her hands are only clean if she didn't know and then dumped him the moment she found out.", "Eh, still doesn't absolve the chick. I mean,  once the divorce proceedings actually started, I think it might be hard not to notice that he lied? And maybe think about the position that puts her in? \n\nHonestly,  even when the AP doesn't know that they're banging a married person, it still ends up being on them somewhat once they figure it out.\n\nETA- separated is not divorced, and when you know there are extenuating circumstances (kids primarily, but  also pets or other things like sentimental assets) is best to tread lightly,  not hip right on the \"I'm the awesome new bonus mom,  everybody love me\" train.", "She\u2019s closer in age to the kids than the ex. No wonder they get along.", "This is probably the best way. It's how I deal with my family. Chatting to XZ but don't mention YZ.", "Not many young gold diggers are there to steal other people's husbands", "You misunderstood me. OP believes Mallory ended her marriage because Mallory dated a married man, OP's then husband.", "Oh true but my point still stands regardless that she needs to find a way to be happy in herself. Obviously the resentment is eating away at her and thats going to flow through on her kids.", "You'd be surprised how creative cheaters are and how naive 19 years old girls.", "What if it was your husband that pursued her?\n\nDoes he have no willpower, it seems like you're putting all the blame on the girl even though she's not blameless.", "Your ex husband is not a bike, he can't be stolen. He willingly participated in an activity he knew would hurt you and the boundaries of your marriage. **He** is the one that ultimately had the largest responsibility to you and your kids. \n\nStop making this situation all about her. She fucked up, yes, but ultimately she is now your ex's partner and that comes with being an adult in your children's lives. \n\nUnless your children are in danger, are being isolated from you or your reputation is being harmed by Mallory, you need to get yourself in order and be a bloody co-parent. Your children get to dictate the relationship they have or want with her, you need to follow their lead in supporting that. \n\nIt doesn't mean you and Mallory need to be besties, doesn't mean that your kids will always see her in a favourable light, but it does mean that you support your kids.", "every comment you are making here demonstrates that YTA.", "She did not steal anything.

That\u2019s called cheating.", "OP, surely you wouldn\u2019t want your kids required to spend time in a home where they were resented and disliked. And unless your ex is bad to them, they deserve to spend time with him.
