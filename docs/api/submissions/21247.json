Just because it was found on the property doesn't mean your cousin's are entitled to it at all, and that they think that is crazy to me. The guest checked with you and made sure no one had lost. You said no and as such it should go to them because as juvenile as it sounds... finders keepers. lol", "ESH - the ring should be turned into the cops", "Nta.

Some random family members think they should have it since they are family? Absolutely laughable. I'd tell them if they don't think the person who found it should have it, then it should be tried to reunited with its original owner. It makes no sense that they should have been given it simply for being related to whoever owns the house? \n \nImagine it being a FAKE ring.", "NTA. Your parents own the beach.

Let's be real the chances of the actual owner being found are super low I mean for all we know it could've washed onto the beach from somewhere else entirely.
