Ring should have been turned over to the police. Surely someone is looking for it. Shame on you and your family. Disgusting.", "Those sound like bad ideas cus just anyone can claim it's theirs. Let's be real the chances of the actual owner being found are super low I mean for all we know it could've washed onto the beach from somewhere else entirely. If they come across someone looking for the ring and don't give it back then that'd be a sucky move but I think most people would agree it would be pretty much impossible to find the actual owners and not end up giving it to someone pretending to have lost it.", "That\u2019s why you don\u2019t post pictures of the ring and you make people send you pictures before they claim it\n\nI have pictures of my wedding and engagement ring, it\u2019s very common to take pictures of your rings as part of the wedding pictures, and for non engagement rings still people often have a picture with them wearing it even if it isn\u2019t zoomed in on their hands", "ESH are you all 5? It\u2019s not finders keepers, take it to the police station. Grow up", "Firstly, your cousins are not entitled to the ring but have you heard of \"theft by finding?\" \n\nThe ring belongs to someone and should be reported to the police.

I notice that the police station is not on your list of options.", "YTA- turn it in to the police or post on the neighborhood Facebook/ Nextdoor app. What are you guys, 5 years old??", "ESH. In this day and age you could easily make an attempt to find the owner. Very easy to do on social media. If the ring is valuable you should report it to the police. The owner could be devastated at losing it.", "ESH. Granted if you found the owner of the ring, congratulations. Then return the ring to them. If it had value or the person was uncontactable, take it to the police station. \n\nThe nerve of your family to think about who in your family will own it.", "NTA?\n\nHow is this even a question?\n\nIf the ring isn't the cousins, they have no claim to it. The friend found it. It's hers unless the owner comes for it.\n\nI struggle to imagine a situation where the person other than either a) the person who owns the ring or b)found the ring has a right to it.\n\nIf the rightful owner comes looking for it though, they should give it back.\n\nA lot of folks are suggesting to hand it to the police, but if the rightful owner will ever be holding this ring again, it won't be the police handing it over, IMHO.", "NTA. \n\nYour cousins have no stake in this. Maybe run it by your parents and double check that it wasn't lost by someone they know. I do agree with the other comments saying that it's the *right* thing to do by maybe posting it on a Facebook group for the area, or seeing if someone's reported it missing at the police station. I don't think it is completely necessary/required if it is lost by a trespasser on your private property, but would be the nice thing to do. \n\nBut if you don't find /decide not to find its \"true\" owner, then I think your guest has every right to keep it.", "Your cousins' manners are awful.  It was 100% up to your family who could keep the ring, and the matter was already decided.", "Come on!

The ring should either go to the owner(s) of the house or to the person who found it.\n\nNTA", "Agreed, like what level of entitlement does it take to bestow someone's lost and valuable property under the \"finders keepers losers weepers\" standard? Like I always love the thought of OP coming in on the other side being all omg I lost my ring but rightfully it goes to some AH that found it, right guys??", "this is a good idea", "Lol. Where I live things that fall into police possession simply disappear.", "What happens if was lost in the water on the public beach and washed up on/near the private beach? Finders keepers is not a rule. Common sense should prevail, and it should be turned over to the police.", "In many beach communities found items are often turned over to the police.", "Yes, among the entire group none thought to try and find the owner. Some people will post about a found ring and if the owner can describe it adequately, they return it to them. YTA.", "Fair, but she doesn\u2019t even consider it as an option. That concerns me a bit.", "Yep. Turned $200 I found into the police when I was a kid. I\u2019m sure they tried very hard to find the owner lmao.", "Or at least have them describe it. So if it's an emerald and they tell you it's a diamond, you know they're BSing.", "I would have been screwed if it were mine then. I have zero pictures of my wedding and engagement rings, because why do I want pictures of rings?\n\nI don\u2019t have them now anyway due to a criminal exBIL and cops that don\u2019t give a damn/have some sort of love for him, but that\u2019s another story entirely.", "Still can't be certain plus as I said the chances of the owner seeing any post is super slim anyway. I feel like most people who find anything on the ground would just keep it unless it's like clearly super fancy and expensive or engraved or something. But yk this was found on a beach and tbh there's no way of knowing how long it was there or as I said if it didn't wash up from somewhere else entirely or if it was dropped by someone who only visited that area for a little while like there's so many possibilities that it's not super shocking that if they didn't see anyone looking or see any post that they'd keep it.", "Obviously the person who found it did try to find the owner. She informed OP, she didn't pocket it. OP specifically says it didn't belong to anyone at the party and no one has lost a ring on the property to OP's knowledge. \n\nOP and ring finder are not being dishonest. It's simply not worth the time/effort to go to the police about a random lost ring that is likely worthless and impossible to trace. Be practical.\n\nNTA OP. The cousin's are being super weird. You acknowledge you have no claim to this ring so why would you be able to take it from the finder and give it to them??", "[deleted]", "Well, that's one reason to take some pictures.

People are metal detecting on beaches all the time and find all kinds of stuff.\n\nIf no one in the family or guest lost it then who know how long it has been on the beach.", "NTA \nOP is not the one who found the ring so it\u2019s not really their responsibility to take it to the police. And your cousins are greedy assholes lol.", "The police would never return it to anyone. They steal more from the public than all other robbers in the USA combined. Turning it in to the police won't accomplish anything.", "Or put the guest/renter as the finder. Simple enough.", "You sound very informed. Tell us more.", "Yes, in my understanding, whoever turns in the item can keep it if it isn't claimed. It may not work that way everywhere, but it's what I've been told happens in my area.", "There's a Washington Post article if you Google \"police stole more than burglars.\" There's a lot of information about this. I thought it was practically common knowledge? It's part of why you never trust cops as default.", "I turned in $500 I found to the police once. It was in a bank envelope in a mall parking lot. They sent me a letter a few months later that it hadn\u2019t been claimed and that it was mine. It happens.", "Even describing it can prove ownership, though. Surely you could say it was a round cut solitaire in a white gold band with a five prong setting or whatever, and what are the odds of you having guessed that correctly?", "Lol, your account has literally ZERO karma.  I\u2019ve never seen that before.  \n\nYou post so many comments that get downvoted so much, that even the \u201cfree\u201d +1 from saying literally anything isn\u2019t enough to offset it.  \n\n\u2026and I can\u2019t imagine why", ">This is the only reasonable way to try to find a lost ring's owner because anyone can say \"that's mine\".\n\nIt's relatively simple to describe the item too.\n\nSame concept as returning lost money.\n\n\"I found some money, did anyone lose some?\" ($25)\n\n\"Yeah I lost $7.\" \n\n\"Okay, that's not what I found. Anyone else?\"", "Agreed. Wouldn\u2019t help in my case though. Just for those with lost rings. Not sure why I was downvoted. Because I don\u2019t take pictures of everything I own, or because I was robbed?"]}
