You have no idea what you want in life until your late 20s.", "NTA,   \u2026 but your wedding guests or even society in general is. Let\u2019s hope that your sister can find someone openminded and intelligent enough who realizes that her character, worth whatever has nothing to do with whether or not her younger sister got married before her.", "NTA, your family are the assholes here.\n\nYou are an adult, why should your family dictate who you can or can't live with?  Who gives a shit what they say?  Family seeking alliances to get your older sister married?  Man there is so much to unpack here.  \n\nDoes your sister want to get married?  Your family needs to F off and leave you and your sister to your own lives.", "I'm not sure how reliable answers you will be getting here. Ass-holery is much of a cultural thing. For Western standards, your behavior is definitely NTA. You didn't ruin your sister's life at all, and you had the right to marry whenever you felt ready.\n\nYou mention that your parents were looking for alliances for your sister. Is she restricted to marry someone from an alliance accorded by your parents? If so, were you held to the same standard? This is not on you, but your parents may be the AH if they are allowing you to get your own partner but pretend for your sister to wait for their alliances to work, or for being better matchmakers with you than with her.", "OP, this is not the right place for this question. Cultural differences are just too big. The truth is, every judgement will be against your culture and traditions, not you or your sister.", "NTA. Alliances? The hell time period is this, medieval Europe?", "NTA. Marriage is not a competetive sport.  Couples marry when they are ready, no timer is running.  Those who think otherwise have the issue.  They have no right to make it yours.", "NTA - This is a highly cultural topic, but the root of it goes down to your parents putting you in a tight spot so they are the ones to be blamed (and frankly the AH to blame you now). I'm really sorry, but someone should have raised concerns BEFORE the wedding.", "So... If your sister never gets married, you shouldn't get married either?\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nAny toxic family members who raise a stink about birth order marriage should be blocked.", "Your sister doesn\u2019t have to get married. But she can\u2019t pitch a fit because *you* got married, now. being unwilling to wait for the foreseeable forever for *her* to do it first!\n\nLife goes on. You made all your choices. Sucks for your sister that she can\u2019t make you put your life on hold. NTA", "NTA. Sorry your entire culture is an asshole for holding on to this ridiculous standard.", "NTA. It's not your fault that that's all they could talk about was the fact that your older sister was not yet married. In fact, I'd find it rather offensive if at \"my\" wedding, everyone talked about my sibling, instead of the wedding happening around them. It is also not your fault that your sister hasn't found someone to marry yet. Life doesn't always works out the way you want, and you shouldn't have to hold your life back because of her. If it's all your family talked about at the wedding and then they're blaming you for it, they really ought to look in the mirror because they're the ones who are making a big deal out of this. It's nothing. Your sister will find her person when the time is right, or she won't, and that's that.", "Assuming you didn\u2019t join in the gossip, NTA, but your toxic family members sure are. It\u2019s really unfortunate that your family feels the need to gossip about and shame your sister, but that\u2019s not your fault and you can\u2019t be expected to delay your marriage indefinitely because of other people\u2019s backwards, sexist beliefs. I hope you let your sister know that you don\u2019t share your family\u2019s views.", "NTA \n\nReligion sucks.", "NTA. So if your older sister just never married does that mean you don\u2019t get to either? It all sounds very asinine & I\u2019m sorry that it feels like it overshadowed your wedding, but I really don\u2019t think you guys did anything wrong.", "First and foremost, NTA\n\nI take it you are a first gen born of immigrant parents living in a western society, and the rest of your family are either immigrants or still living in an eastern society?     \n\nI think the first generation has the most difficult task of juggling two identities and cultures, the one they grow up in and the one their parents instill in them.  \n\nIf I am reading this correctly, your sister doesn't take any issue with you getting married. You are lucky to have an elder sibling who is happy for you and supports you, even knowing she will take a brunt of criticism from the family, none of her own making.   \n\nIt's okay to find happiness. Don't get bogged down in the family rhetoric, you have the support of the one person who is most affected by the family orthodoxy, that's all that matters.", "yall got some weird families", "NTA. As if 29 is old! This all sounds ridiculous to me me but then I\u2019m not religious.", "You aren't. Your sister isn't. Everyone who made her feel bad is an asshole.", "NTA.", "NTA. People need to get over these ridiculous superstitions.", "NTA whatsoever.\n\nYour family is toxic and even if it's a culture thing you are not at fault for anything.\n\nSounds like your sister herself doesn't care about being married after you, so why the mess from family?", "NTA. When you\u2019re a child, most, if not all of life\u2019s milestones go by chronological age. It was only natural that your sister would walk before you, talk before you, start school before you, etc. She is older and you are younger.\n\nBut when you become an adult, life doesn\u2019t follow the same linear path. Some people choose to go to college right after high school while some people chose to attend college later (or not at all). Some people start their careers at a younger age (perhaps they knew what they wanted to do professionally at a young age), and other people try several professions before finding something they like. People get married in their early 20s, and others get married later - perhaps it takes them longer to find the right partner; perhaps they want to focus on work or school before getting married; or perhaps they had their heart broken by a former significant other and need time to heal - the reasons why are endless. And let\u2019s not forget the people who choose not to get married at all - that\u2019s fine too.\n\nThe fact that your life choices don\u2019t follow the same linear path as your sister\u2019s is not a bad thing. You finding the right person to marry sooner does not prevent your sister from finding the right person for her. It\u2019s possible that your family (including your sister) expected that she would get married first simply because she was older, but as we all know, life doesn\u2019t always turn out the way we expect it to.\n\nFWIW, my husband and I were married for nearly 12 years before his older brother got married. When we first announced our engagement to his family, his parents asked us to consider waiting for my brother in law to get married first since he was older - nevermind the fact that my brother in law was not dating anyone seriously at that time. My husband and I decided that it\u2019s okay for us to be happy and that we shouldn\u2019t have to put our lives on hold to accommodate his parents\u2019 expectations. Also, I\u2019m so glad that my brother in law waited to get married until he found the right person because his wife is lovely and he is happy.", "NTA. You are not required to postpone your wedding to accommodate your sister.  Similarly, your sister is not required to get married to someone before she's ready just to clear the way for you to get married.  You are two people living two separate lives--if only everyone in your family and community would understand this as well and butt out.", "LMAO I\u2019m actually speechless NTA", "NTA - Sounds like your family is living in the 18th century", "NTA\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nAnd if your sister never finds someone she want to marry?\n\nYou have to stay an old maid for the rest of your life, too?", "fuck that culture mindset. you do you.", "NTA. The whole tradition sounds like bullshit. Why should you feel bad because she can't snag a husband?", "This post sounds like it is out of the 1500s.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We arent married for a variety of reasons, but my family accepts him as my partner. We were friends and roommates first, so we were already living together when we became a couple.\n\nMy youngest sister has been with her partner for over 10 years.

That you respect your sisters decision to carefully choose a partner, and that you were lucky to have an easier time finding your husband.\n\nIf you and your sister are a united front, and ignore or stand up for each other to your rude relatives, things will go more smoothly for you both.

Too bad she isn't as good a catch as her sister.\" Again, rude to both of you! Implying youre only worth is in your ability to 'trick' or 'catch' a mans attention and get him to marry you. Gross.\n\nIf you want those attitudes to change you need to stand up against them. Even if it's just by saying \"Oh, Auntie. My sister is a strong woman, with high standards.

Living together has never been illegal, it is not socially sanctioned but that has never stopped people from living together.

But quite a few go in for \" semi arranged\" marriages because their relationships fell through or they hadn't met anyone they liked well enough.
