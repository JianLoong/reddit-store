{"id": 9577, "submission_id": "10y95kx", "title": "AITA for wanting to exclude my sister?", "selftext": "My (15F) family likes to have a movie night, we basically do that on Fridays when my parents don't have work and my sister (19,F) doesn't have too much work for college. It usually happens like once a month. Mom insists on doing it or just having us all play a game so we can bond and have a good time and it is really fun so no one complains about it.\n\nAnyways, I recently noticed that my sister (19,F) starts crying everytime we watch a movie. Like not the sad movies or anything like that, any movie that's for younger kids that we usually put on for my other sister (10, F) just has her face tearful. It's usually  random movies about friendship or simple ideas like that or just Disney movies or Studio Ghibli ones. She doesn't cry at all at anything else. I have no idea why. It's also during random parts of the movie that it makes no sense to cry about (like someone flying, or someone hugging someone, or someone sitting in a garden or something).\n\nNo one else really notices because it's usually dark and we don't really talk during movies. Plus my sister is very unemotional usually and this is so unexpected that even if I told anyone they wouldn't believe me till they saw it (she also makes no sound anyways). It also only happens that my sister is seated next to me during the movies and my parents and other sister are further away so they wouldn't notice at all. I notice because I usually have to check my phone so her face is a bit clearer for me. \n\nThis week my mom suggested another movie like that for us to watch next week. And since this time she agreed we'd be doing it with my friend coming over I thought it would ruin the mood for the night if she saw my sister like that and it was just not something I want to deal with. My friend is also nosy and knows my sister very well and I kind of just want us to have fun without my sister in the picture.\n\nSo here is where I may be TA, I told my mom I'm okay doing it as long as my sister is not there. And if she is there then she has to stop crying over nothing and control her emotions for the night. My mom didn't see where I was coming from and told me if that's the case then they will do it without me. I don't really want that so I told her that my sister is too old for this anyways and we could just not invite her from now on. She looked really upset and told me to go to my room.

Why do you care if she cries? Why does crying bother you? Is it loud? You said that no one even notices, so it seems like silent crying. Maybe think about why emotional expression bothers you so much. I tear up at a lot of movies, and what makes some people cry doesn\u2019t make other people cry.\n\nYTA, you\u2019re trying to get your sister kicked out of family movie night because \u201ccrying isn\u2019t cool\u201d. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA\n\n>I told her that my sister is too old for this anyways and we could just not invite her from now on\n\nAh, the sweet, naivety of being 15.\n\nYou realize that life doesn't just stop at 18, right?", "YTA.

I hope for your sake this is just a regular case of a a teenager lacking basic empathy because honestly this is a very concerning and alarming way for you to be behaving and thinking. That is your sister.

Your sister is tearing up in the dark and you can''t even spend time watching a movie without checking your phone, therefore lighting up her face.\n\nYour mother has the right idea, maybe you can sit in your room for a couple of hours and stare at your phone.", "YTA, no doubt about that.\nShe silently cries when emotional things happens in movies, but not in actual life. That's a good majority of people that do that. Sounds like she actually has her emotions in check. You obviously do not have yours in check if you think someone silently crying during a movie is ruining your day. If your emberressed by your sister doing that and your \"friend\" seeing it. Then you care more about yourself and what people you arnt going to see/talk to after high school think.", "\nMaybe you should sit out of the family bonding time because you clearly haven\u2019t bonded with your sister at all if you can be so callous towards her. Some of those Disney and Ghibli movies have sad scenes in them. Also they have messages in them that won\u2019t affect you the way it will affect others going through things. If you didn\u2019t get the message from those movies then the message wasn\u2019t for you btw. \n\n\nIn the US, 19 is around the age where people move on to college and sometimes those friendships in high school won\u2019t last due to distance, lack of time, and personal change/growth. She\u2019s probably missing those friendships and reminiscing the times spent together. Now you\u2019re trying to keep her from bonding time with the family all because you\u2019re worried about being embarrassed? YTA", "YTA. So what if she's emotional? If nobody even notices it or makes a big deal out of it, why does even matter to you? Your mom is right to be upset because you are just being mean at this point.", "YTA\n\nThe way you talk about this is so disrespectful. It's not like she is making a fuss or even being loud and the only way you notice is if you are on your phone...\n\nI agree with your Mom.", "Yep YTA x 2. Your sister is a sensitive soul. There's nothing wrong with crying when you feel touched while watching a movie. There's nothing embarrassing about that and if your friend is rude enough to point it out or make fun of your sister that's on her. It's absolutely unacceptable and incredibly selfish to even suggest that your family exclude your sister. Stay in your room with your guest.", "Yes YTA and I think your mom is very smart! You are being very mean and really you could have a little more empathy for your sister. Maybe you should check in on her, is she doing ok? Why is she crying? Is it really just the movie?

I\u2019m also 53.\n\nBTW, you don\u2019t HAVE to check your phone while watching a movie.", "YTA\nHave you even bothered to ask what's up.", "YTA. Your sister sounds like she is under pressure at college. She can only sometimes make your movie nights due to workload. She has randomly started crying which can be a sign of depression or being overwhelmed. And your response is not to worry about your sister but exclude her because she annoys you.\n\nAlso family movies are about family and that includes your sister.

I get that your 15 and all teenagers are self centered jerks at this stage of life but literally get yourself together. I'm 22 now and at 15 I sucked but I grew up and I realized being kind is important as hell. Being like this is gonna make you very not liked in life and will hold you back. Having a little empathy towards people goes a long way as does being inclusive and pleasant. People of all ages, old and young, have all sorts of emotions and that is 1000% vaild. I had to learn all this the hard way and I hope you don't have to do the same. Take everyone here calling you TA and take the fact that your mother would rather leave your unpleasant self out rather than your sister as a sign your attitude needs an adjustment and grow up.", "YTA, your sister isn't bothering anyone. You sound pretty judgmental to try to say that she shouldn't cry at movies. A lot of movies have emotional scenes in them, not just sad. People cry for all sorts of reasons, including happiness, relief, and fear. Your home should be a safe place for your sister to let out her emotions, just because she's usually doesn't show her emotions, doesn't mean she doesn't have them.", "Wow; you are such the a*****e here.

Instead of thinking about how she's going to make you look to your friend, how about you ask your sister if everything's alright and if there's something bothering her?  Trust me, I have a sister: you won't get struck by lightning if you look like you care about her for 1 second.", "At 15 it\u2019s normal to lack empathy and emotional intelligence, but not to this extent. YTA for sure but more importantly you will only hurt yourself if you cannot learn to tolerate and even appreciate other people\u2019s emotional experiences", "YTA I have a funny feeling your sister isn't \"unemotional\" she just doesn't share that side of herself with YOU.  I also doubt you know her as well as you think you do. There's four years between you and she's in college which is a completely different stage of life. Have some empathy, She very well may be struggling. \n\nEven if she's not most Disney or studio Ghibli style movies are made for children AND adults so there's content in them which will strike each demographic. If you could remember the scenes she cried during I'm sure some older folks here would say they also shed a year during some of those scenes. Different things resonate with different people.", "YTA. Maybe the only time she feels safe showing her emotions is during a movie. A dark room, heartwarming movie, a box of tissues, might be what brings out her emotions. Try being more empathetic.", "I don't want to pile on here but you are being really insensitive.  Have you ever tried to out why your sister is crying?  Are you at all concerned about her?", "YTA\n\nFirst, instead of being embarrassed by your sister and trying to hide her from your friend, perhaps warn your friend that your sister cries (very quietly) during movies. It's really not uncommon.\n\nSecondly, and I think you will learn this with age, you are responsible for your emotions and reactions, not your sister. Your sister does not have to stop this harmless response to cater to your feelings.", "Yeah... YTA. you cannot exclude your SISTER from FAMILY night because she cries during movies? Wtf is wrong with you??m", "Yta", "YTA who cares if your sis cries  during a movie, it isn't inconveniencing anyone else and you're being really mean trying to exclude her. \n\nHave you even considered that your sister could be dealing with something you don't know about, movie night could be the time she uses to let go of some of her feelings.", "YTA. Why do you spend so much time watching her instead of watching the movie? I'm more concerned about your tact and empathy deficiencies than her emotional regulation. You're trying to exclude a family member from a family activity for no valid reason. You're also judging her, which you have no right to do.  If your friend is uncomfortable, they can go home.", "YTA\n\nSince it bothers you so much, stop sitting next to your sister.

Also, no need  to watch any Disney, Pixar movies as plenty of movies are  family friendly without being from these studios", "YTA - I am 30 and have not made it through a Disney movie without crying in decades. They are meant to be touching, they are meant to make you feel something sad/beautiful/tragic, they are meant to help you connect to emotions you didn't know we were there. Like empathy, you should try that one!", "YTA \n\nI love your mom. Since *you* are the one with the problem then *you* should be the one to sit it out.\n\nAnd NO you don't *have* to check your phone during the movie. You choose to.

Your opinion is irrelevant to her emotions.  You have some serious growing up to do", "YTA.

This affects you how, exactly?  \n\nGet over yourself.", "Random parts of the movie? The things you described are all emotionally touching. Do you think that people only feel emotion over devastatingly sad moments in movies? Your sister's behaviour is completely normal.\n\nYTA for all the obvious reasons but what really got me is that you \"have to\" look at your phone. You can't give your family 90 minutes? You want to exclude your sister from family time, which you have already checked out of?", "YTA. \"my sister cries sometimes when we watch movies with emotional scenes and themes, and this show of emotion embarrasses me for some reason.\"\n\nlook inward. work on yourself. apologize. you are completely in the wrong here.", "Have you ever considered, that your sister is rather unemotional otherwise because it's not accepted in your household? You are already overreacting by her silently crying, how would she ever feel safe openly showing her emotions?\n\n\n\nA big hang up for you is that she cries about \"nothing\" but maybe that's just her channel to work through those feelings. Crying is healthy (mainly connected to hormones and stress release, really interesting if you want to read up on it), so by crying at \"harmless\" movies, your sister found a great way for her to get the benefits of crying, without the mental breakdown. Also crying is just an indicator of strong emotion, hence things like happy crying.\n\n\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with your sister crying when visitors come, that's still a bit asshole territory, but completely different than just straight up wanting to exclude her. When you say \"Oh we just uninvite her\" I can guarantee you, your sister will just be crying alone in her room instead. Do you think that makes you the asshole?", "YTA for not even being concerned about her.", "YTA. She\u2019s not bothering anyone but you. Leave her alone.

There is nothing wrong with that.", "YTA - very much so. \n\n\nYour sister may be going through something that those movies are triggering.  You have not talked to your sister or asked her anything about it so your assertion that she is just fine is completely BS. I guarantee that your 19 year old sister is not sharing everything with her 15 year old sister (especially if this is how you act when someone gets teary eyed around you).  Or she is just someone who gets emotional during sappy movies - which is not nearly as unusual as you seem to think. \n\n\nYou are even more of an AH for that crack about your sister being too old. She isn't.  Guess what, she will **never** be too old.  Whether it be watching kid movies, spending time with her family, or getting emotional during sappy scenes in movies (btw I know plenty of people older than her that do all those things). \n\nAlso, who cares if your friend notices. If you are so damn concerned then don't sit next to your sister. **Problem solved**\n\nDon't be a brat, it's not a good look.\n\nAlso - you have no right to exclude your sister here, you are the one with a problem so you are the one who doesn't need to be part of your family night.", "YTA\n\nI'm 32 and still watch movies with my mother. Your mother wants to spend time together. She doesn't want to exclude one of her children. You are being unreasonable. Your sister isn't even disturbing anyone by crying from what you said.\n\nAlso, if your sister is randomly crying for no reason, something might be going on with her. Excluding her from stuff isn't going to help with that. Maybe try talking to her? Then again, it might be nothing because people cry. I cry every damn time I watch Coco, and I doubt it is going to change anytime soon.", "YTA.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide when and where people express emotion or what\u2019s an acceptable trigger for tears.

I\u2019m normally a pretty unemotional person but sometimes a movie (usually involving animals or someone finding acceptance/community after living without it for a long time) will get me and I\u2019ll find myself crying for no reason. This is especially true around my period when my hormones are all out of whack or if I\u2019m stressed out but trying to power through it without letting my feelings get the best of me.\n\nIt\u2019s a little weird that your first reaction is to exclude your sister instead of, you know, talking to her\u2026 You don\u2019t even have to bring up the crying, just mention you\u2019ve noticed something has been off the last few times y\u2019all have had movie night and you just wanted to make sure she\u2019s doing ok. \n\nTo frame it differently: how would YOU feel if the roles were reversed and it was you who was upset/crying and \u2014 when your sister noticed \u2014 she took it upon herself to decide you shouldn\u2019t feel that way.

You have the emotional maturity of a rock.", "YTA - you saw a loved one crying repeatedly and instead of asking about it you\u2019ve instead decided to encourage your family to exclude your sister who very obviously is having a rough time from spending family time together. Jesus Christ, yeah you were unbelievably cruel.", "YTA. Who tf cares if she cries watching a movie? Its not unheard of for people to get emotional while watching a film. You also say she makes no noise, so whats the big deal? \n\nI would argue you're the AH for checking your phone during family movie night. Theres a reason theaters ask you to turn off cellphones but no rule saying you cant cry. Likely youre the one making a diaturbance moreo than your sister", "YTA.\n\nDisney and Studio Ghibli are VERY good at causing devastating heartbreak and lots of emotions with their movies. Grave of the Fireflies, and pretty much ALL of the Pixar movies are notorious for making even the hardest viewers break down.

Not a huge deal because you\u2019re 15 and you\u2019ll likely get some more emotional intelligence as you get older, and you\u2019ll also learn to not be so insecure that stuff like that embarrasses you.

If nobody else notices because they don't sit next to her, just sit somewhere else!\n\nCrying during a movie is not like crying over being dumped or hearing your ex is engaged -- it has nothing to do with anything real and this doesn't bring the mood down.\n\nI truly in my heart of hearts have no idea why this would bother you. My brother objects to people doing things he judges as \"weird,\" and he has a VERY low bar for what qualifies as \"weird.\" Is that it?

She's not asking you to have a heart-to-heart about.  She's literally just having feelings quietly in your vicinity.  If you can't handle that, then it's up to you to remove yourself - not gatekeep and have your sister excluded from family activities.\n\nYou only get to control you and how you react.

Let her know that you\u2019re not a completely selfish AH!", "YTA... and she's probably not sad crying, it's likely moreso a nostalgic moment for her. But instead of me guessing and you not caring, how about you TALK TO YOUR SISTER AND BE NICE.", "Soft YTA. \nMy youngest sister was born when I was 14 and boy did I hate that kid! She cried and smelled and took all the attention I should have been getting from my parents. My middle sister, 12 at the time, absolutely loved the baby too, so I was totally alone in my hatred.\nI moved away for school when I was 18, baby was 4 or 5 by that point, and I remember my family and I all sat down to watch Moana the night before I left, which was so embarrassing! I\u2019m about to leave and be an adult for the first time in my life and I have to watch a kids movie, are you kidding me? \nAnd then she was singing along to all the little tunes, my mom was laughing, my middle sister was cuddled up with baby in her lap, my step-dad was pretending to be annoyed to make her laugh, and all of a sudden I\u2019m crying. Like your sister, I\u2019m not an emotional person in the slightest, I hate hugs and the most I say when heading out of my family\u2019s house is a quick love ya! \nAny time one of those kids movies is on now though, I\u2019m a wreck and a half. I love my little sisters and kids movies just make me think of her little singing voice, how she would dance when she was so young, how much bigger and smarter she is now. It\u2019s weird to remember her as a little weird alien and realize that she\u2019s a whole person now. At 14, I would have never cried over a movie just because it makes me think of my little sisters, and maybe you never will, that\u2019s totally fine! Just know some people do, and that\u2019s okay too.", "Kid, YTA. Be kinder. Someone seeming to shut down emotionally only to well up like that in the dark... to Ghibli films... thinking no one sees... is clearly Having A Bad Time. This is a good time to try out a softer approach and be not just a better sibling but a good friend here and showing that your hands are open to hold someone up when they're low. Not to shame or exclude. That is heartless thinking.", "YTA and you\u2019re being a really bad sister. No offense but as a 15 year old obviously you don\u2019t understand the life transition your sister is going through, she\u2019s in the prime age of realizing childhood is gone and it\u2019s painful and sad and scary and the fact she has a lot on her plate with college\u2026. You should apologize to both your sister and mom and really understand that what you did was not okay and the way you\u2019re seeing this situation is not okay and really immature", "I also cry when I watch kids movies. More so if it\u2019s ones that I grew up watching, but even ones that I don\u2019t have a personal connection to make me tear up and want to just sob. I haven\u2019t quite figured out what the cause is, but it\u2019s probably because of some childhood trauma that I\u2019ve chosen to repress over the hearts. I think it\u2019s really cruel that you want to exclude your sister over something that\u2019s literally bothering no one other than yourself. YTA, it\u2019s called FAMILY bonding because it\u2019s meant for the whole FAMILY to be involved.", "Studio ghilibi has some super sad movies I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s crying", "YTA why do you not like your sister? You seem just like my sister. She always found an excuse to hate me no matter what I did and now we never speak. Of course your mum isn\u2019t going to uninvite your sister cause you say so. So mean. Grow up.", "YTA, Ghibli films are beautiful and many show an innocence that can be lost with time. Crying can be very cathartic, if it's how she feels she can express whatever she's feeling leave her alone.", "bro I know everyone is an asshole at 15 but man you are next level", "YTA - what a selfish, entitled post. Why don't you bow out of the family night if your sister quietly crying annoys you so much. Go to your room.", "Soft YTA\n\nI\u2019ve found as I\u2019ve gotten older, my favorite childhood movies and even new Disney films have me absolute BAWLING, even if I watched them just for enjoyment as a kid or teen. \n\nYou\u2019re super young and immature, but that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m sure you will grow up eventually and understand exactly why your sister is emotional in those moments. You\u2019ll probably be right there next to her crying.", "Yeah, you don\u2019t get to decide what is or is not sad for someone else. Emotional reactions to things are not like, objective. There\u2019s not a correct response. You\u2019re projecting how YOU feel about those movies onto someone else and expecting THEM to feel the same way as you do. \n\nThe way you\u2019ve described this situation betrays a lack of empathy. The easiest way I can think to explain what to do here is to get curious instead of getting judgmental when someone else\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t make sense to you. This behavior isn\u2019t hurting anyone else or threatening anyone else, therefore it\u2019s not for you to judge. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Jeez girl, have some empathy. Some people are easy criers. ( Myself included ) I was sobbing at the short in the theaters before Encanto and then cried several times during the actual movie. So did my sister. But my 10yo niece was stone cold. Hell, I don't WANT to cry at life insurance commercials, but it happens. If her crying is an issue, sit somewhere else. A different couch, as mom or sis to switch with you, pull up a dining room table or ask your parents to buy a bean bag for movie nights. Anything other than not inviting your sister from a family event.", "YTA, excluding your sister is mean. You\u2019re never too old to spend time with family. Your mom is upset because your behavior is unkind. She might be disappointed in your lack of empathy \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not the movies but spending time with your family that\u2019s making her emotional. Even if it is the movie, who cares? It\u2019s not hurting you and there shouldn\u2019t be anything embarrassing about it.\n\nAre you sure you just don\u2019t want your friend to be concerned about your sister? Like maybe you don\u2019t want to share their attention?", "YTA. what the fuck? so it\u2019s unusual for her to cry, and instead of i don\u2019t know, talking to her? asking, you don\u2019t want to be embarrassed because your friend is nosy \u2014 or, actually, not nosy, but CARES enough to ask your sister what\u2019s wrong?

Today I can\u2019t cry for myself. Even when my mom went through cancer and passed away I had one time I was able to cry for about 5 maybe 10 seconds in the shower. I wanted it to just go and get it out. But years of repression kicked in and my body forced it to stop. Literally hurt more having the crying stop.\n\nDon\u2019t be the person who might make someone begging to repress feelings.", "YTA\n\nI feel like this doesn't even need my more you should know how", "Wow, YTA. Glad your mom said fine you don't like your sister there then you don't come. I gotta stop cause you're a baby and don't know any better but man, you are mean.", "When I go through trauma or depression I will sob every time I\u2019m alone.  The car mostly.  But I\u2019m normal around people.  Your sister might be really struggling and being in the dark and surrounded by her family might be when intrusive grief comes out", "YTA oh for Pete's sake \ud83d\ude44 now I've heard it all! How in the world is your sister silently crying, bothering you? Just don't look at her! You said she doesn't make noise so the only way you would know is by looking at her. DONT LOOK AT HER! This is so petty \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. I\u2019m 40 and have cried during Disney and Pixar movies. Who cares? Why are you so angry over her crying?", "I\u2019m the same way as your sister, I can cry watching a simple commercial but ACT \u201cemotionless\u201d in public when it comes to real life stuff and just break down when I\u2019m alone, it would absolutely break my heart if my family ever tries to exclude me just because I cry a little during a movie. I understand you\u2019re 15 and obviously very immature which is normal for people your age and I know this won\u2019t be your mind set in a few year but just give your sister some grace, maybe she acts like she has zero emotions sometimes but I\u2019m sure in private she has many so be there for her, our sisters should be one of our best friends so don\u2019t take that for granted. YTA.", "YTA. Why do you hate your sister so much??? Damn, dude.", "You don\u2019t cry at beautiful small things? Fine. I do. A beautiful meadow or river will make me tear up. Exceptional animation will leave me in awe. Your sister probably feels the beauty inside and she\u2019s moved. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to make sense to you. She\u2019s quiet and discreet. I bet if you don\u2019t mention, your nosy friend probably won\u2019t notice. \n\nGood for your mother for seeing through your nonsense. Mind your own business and let your sister be. Don\u2019t dampen other people\u2019s joy. It\u2019s not a good look.", "YTA. Your behaviour is controlling and mean. Your sister\u2019s tears are none of your business - you don\u2019t get a say in what makes others cry. While I understand that a 15yo is going to be more concerned about a friend\u2019s judgement rather than a family member\u2019s emotional health, that is because you are immature and self-centred, and literally no one should be accommodating your childishness.", "YTA. Having a bit of a cry now and then can be very cathartic, even if there's nothing really wrong and you are usually very self-controlled when it comes to emotional expression. And watching a nice, touching/heartwarming film is one of the best ways of getting that release, in my experience! Your sister isn't hurting anyone by tearing up and intermittently checking your phone is probably more disruptive on family movie night. In a few years, when you go off to college, I hope that you'll have a better understanding of how hurtful it was to suggest to your mother that your sister is \"too old\" for family activities, and you'll learn that everyone is different and as long as they aren't hurting anyone you should just let them be. In the meantime, if your friend does notice your sister crying and finds it as weird as you do, I hope that you'll have your sister's back, no matter what you think privately!", "YTA, you\u2019re not even concerned about your sister. If this is unusual behavior why not ask about it? You\u2019re concerned with perception. This whole thing came off very self centered, it seems you\u2019re the only one bothered by people having emotions while watching movies so it makes sense that YOU shouldn\u2019t participate.", "YTA. She\u2019s not unemotional. You are seeing her have emotions.", "YTA - I often keep my emotions calm during sad moments IRL. No tears, just a frown. Yet I do get teary from even reading books. I also get teary in random scenes in movies because it can remind me of the past.\n\nHeck, I get the giggles when I hear a metal song because it reminds me of a stupid emo phase that lasted literally a day or so because I forgot the song that I listened to which started that phase.\n\nNot to mention, she is probably letting her tears out because she is assuming no one can see her. She probably does have a LOT of problems but has to hide them because she's been raised to not cry and bitch around. Happens more often than you would think.\n\nAlso, do you not realise how *rude* it is to not want the entire family to spend time with your sister because of something that *only you know*? To your mother it's literally you hating on your sister for no reason, which actually are. Its not like she stole your very special diary and laughed about what you wrote in it.", "Your sister is a college student. So much stress and an unrelenting amount of work. Wait til you go to college then you'll understand the crying. \n\nYTA. It's sad she thought she could cry around people she is comfortable around and here you are shaming her for it. You're weird. Think deeper next time.", "YTA. Are you aspiring to become Regina George? Because with this self centered and entitled attitude that's where you're headed. You're never too old to watch movies or cry. NEVER. So your sister cries at some moments while watching movies and instead of understanding that maybe she's deeply affected and movies are her outlet for releasing her emotions that otherwise doesn't express often, you preferred to make it all about yourself and your inconvenience and discomfort. The enticement, insensitivity and self absorption is off the charts here.", "I\u2019m a 33 year old man. All these kids movies got me in tears. Bing bong! Bing Bong? Encanto hits just as hard in its 3rd act. You\u2019re never too old to cry. Feeling emotions is human. It sounds like you have some growing up to do. Stop worrying about what other high schoolers think of you.", "YTA. I'm trying to make allowance for your age but YTA.", "YTA.  I\u2019m glad your mom wants to exclude you instead.", "YTA you said it's not disturbing anyone except you, and you only notice because you're checking your phone (which is a way ruder thing to do during a movie).\n\nFYI I am 28 and still tear up at the happy scenes in movies. They're designed to make you feel free, alive, love, and massive joy - which can be overwhelming. Get over yourself and let her enjoy the movie.", "YTA.  You do know that people cry for more reasons than just being sad right?  She could be appreciative and moved by the art work, or about nature.  She could be wishing life were as simple or as beautiful as the scenes.  Maybe wishing she could be free in the same ways.  She could feel really happy in that moment and tear up.  I don't see the big deal regardless of her reasons.", "YTA.

Around 19/20 I found myself getting emotional at the most absurd things, especially music and movies. I honestly have no idea why, it just happens. But to shun your sister for this crosses a line, especially when it has no actual impact on anyone else", "YTA. You\u2019re the immature one who needs to grow up. Either ignore it or be a good sister and ask her what\u2019s wrong. Wanting to exclude her from family time when you\u2019re the only one who noticed and then being a brat saying you\u2019ll only do it if she\u2019s not there or stops crying\u2026 so rude and entitled. Seriously it\u2019s time to grow up. 15 is old enough to have learned empathy", "YTA", "YTA. A big one. She\u2019s allowed to have big emotions over a movie. She\u2019s allowed to think differently you than. It\u2019s normal and OK for the movies to effect her differently than you.

Go apologize to her.", "YTA YTA YTA. 1000%\n\nI normally give young people some slack because teens are entitled and arrogantly immature (we've all been there), but most grow out of it. \n\nHowever, you sound like the antagonist in a teen Netflix series.

YOU SELFISH BRAT", "I agree with the rest of the comments on here that YTA but there needs to be some sensitivity. OP is FIFTEEN, she doesn't need hundreds of adults on the internet berating her, even if she did ask for advice.

YTA", "YTA but don't feel bad 15 year olds are assholes by default. The sister is at an age when it's normal to feel a little nostalgic about kids stuff. She's becoming an adult and feels like she has to leave kids stuff behind and that can be sad. When you're her age maybe you'll understand or maybe you'll be to cool to cry who knows.", "I mean, I often get swells of emotion during flying scenes or hapoy/touching reunions or scenes where a character is comforting another. These are super normal moments to get kind of moved by imo. Then again, I was a depressed teen and I never cried abt anything except the happy parts of movies. I couldn't have explained it back then but in retrospect I think there's a relief to seeing comforting scenes, and a sadness that you don't experience those emotions in real life.\n\nRegardless, YTA, you were mean to want to exclude your sister, over something she can't control but which isn't bothering anyone (in the dark, she doesn't ake a sound, etc). If you care about her, talk to her about it alone.", "Honey... you need to ask yourself why you view crying as something negative and embarrassing. It is a completely human thing to do. Even grown adults cry too, and sometimes crying is a great way to channel your feelings and bridge understanding. There is nothing wrong with it. It is okay. It is valid.\n\nIt seems you have built walls upon walls of defenses around your heart, and I hope one day you can find peace with yourself to be receptive of gentle emotions positively.

You can do better than this, I believe in you. \n\nNAH", "YTA\n\nHoney, she's crying because of empathy. Many adults cry at kid's movies. Fuck, lots of musical scores used in kid's movies make me cry even if I'm not paying attention to the plotline.

Your only saving grace is that your tenengaer and some you grow out of being horribly selfish assholes. YTA . Like why did you even ahve to ask", "YTA. I can see that crying during what seem to be \u201cinappropriate times\u201d can be uncomfortable but it\u2019s not cool to just exclude her. \n\nLet me say this- I was going through a really hard time in my life at one point, and a girlfriend invited me to a movie, The Help. We got dinner first and I was having a great night, good mood. The lights dimmed for the movie, and from the beginning to the end of that movie I wept. Tears down my face the. Entire. Time. I couldn\u2019t stop them, it was an uncontrollable force. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t think The Help was really meant to be a big tear jerker, but something about the dark movie theater broke my subconscious open and I was able to get some real tears out that I had been holding in for a while.\n\nThis might not be the case with your sister at all, but, please consider that your sister may be feeling some things deeply and maybe you should have some empathy. idk why it\u2019s happening during movies, but it is- so maybe it\u2019s time to check in with her.", "I want to be gentle because you\u2019re young but YTA.

Your mom knows family movie nights will end in near future with all of you aging so do not try to ruin it for everyone else.

Hope she confides in her friends atleast. Maybe it's nothing or a deeper reason but whatever it is you need to grow up a bit.

I regularly cry watching them and I\u2019m 29. Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service is literally about a young girl leaving her family to make a name for herself in a new place.

It\u2019s extremely moving, especially for someone who recently headed out on their own. \n\nAnd things don\u2019t need to be obviously sad to be sad.
