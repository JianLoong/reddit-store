Our wedding included some American and some Chinese customs. We talked over things we wanted or didn\u2019t want and went with what made us happiest. Are there other customs that would make both of you happy? If he objects to all Chinese customs, we\u2019ll, good luck with that", "NTA for asking. But I'd strongly reconsider whether he respects tour Chinese culture if he sees a typical practice as \"dehumanizing.\" He's allowed to decline to participate in any acts that make him uncomfortable. You can find certain traditions important. My question is down thr line how will you handle cultural clashes? Will he be as disgusted by other things you find important? If you have children, how will they be bring up? Will he be super adamant they do not practice any Chinese culture? Will he expect them to follow only white practices (culturally as well as religiously)? This is a bigger conversation that needs to happen before you get married.", "NAH\n\nOP, check this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lfs7m/aita\\_for\\_asking\\_my\\_wife\\_to\\_touch\\_my\\_parents\\_feet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lfs7m/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_touch_my_parents_feet/)\n\nThis is not the same situation (groom didn't inform the bride about this tradition and got angry when he refused to do it during the wedding) but you may find something usuful in the comments.", "Asking him to do this is NTA. And thus far, that's what you've done.\n\nTrying to pressure him into doing this, though - if he's very uncomfortable, then I do think you two need to either find a way to work around this or put off the wedding. \n\nI'm pretty concerned, though, that you seem to have suggested this *once* and he immediately jumped into insulting you and your traditions. He could've started with \"Babe, no, I'm not comfortable with that\" and escalated from there. \n\nWhat do your parents think?", "NAH. It is a subservient gesture in a lot of cultures and he is allowed to be uncomfortable with it.", "NAH. To you, it's a gesture of respect and caring. To him, it's a gesture of dehumanization and supplication. \n\nYou are both allowed to feel the way you feel. Neither or you should force the other to do something you aren't comfortable with.", "It is perfectly reasonable to ask. I think if this is something that really means a lot to you, you need to talk with him about why it is important specifically. Why this over other traditions is the one you want to pick. How you see the tradition and give him the chance to explain how he sees it specifically not just as dehumanizing but why. \n\nMaybe with a more indepth discussion you can find a way to modify the tradition to meet both of your comfort levels. Or create a new family tradition that can honor your parents in a way that allows your fianc\u00e9 to feel that you are respectful equals. Maybe something all the parents can be involved in whether all together or each set separately.", "You do you. Let him be him.\n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable with this kind of stuff either, unless I was marrying the Crown Prince and had to curtsey to his Mom  and Dad....on my way to the castle. \n\nThen I would.", "\n\"While I just wanted this to be a way for him to experience my culture, is it true that I\u2019m forcing him to do something that\u2019s dehumanising?

You grew up with this and to you it has a certain meaning. He grew up different and to him it has a different meaning. \n\nWhat is normal or polite in one culture is super strange in some other. \n\nI think the best thing would be to tell him what's the meaning behind it is and that's important for you and then you look for a way to show this that doesn't make any of you uncomfortable.", "Westerners often see bowing to others as being subservient. That's what I get from reading his response. His choice of words is actually more telling because \" dehumanising \"  is quiet an extreme way of showing displeasure. In itself it could be attributed to a lack of or deficient way of expressing himself but it does bring into question about future children and does he feel OK having children with blended cultures and what all that intails.", "NTA OP. And while I don\u2019t think it is basis for not marrying, this may be an indication on how he views your culture as a whole. The fact that he called you an asshole just for suggesting something speaks volumes. I would ask him why he thinks that this one gesture for this one event bothers him so much, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to do this in his daily life.", "NTA you are pleasing him by having a traditional white wedding. He should be more accepting of your traditions. I understand what he is trying to imply but it's not what that is. It's a sign of respect. If you have compromised for him, he should for you.", "NTA and I am concerned at his unwillingness to engage with your culture.", "ditch your fianc\u00e9 he sounds an ass", "NTA. I love the symbolism and respect it shows to bow to not only one\u2019s elders but *the* elders who brought one\u2019s life partner into this world. It symbolizes respect and honor and gratitude. It\u2019s not a thing in my husband\u2019s family\u2019s culture but if it was I would have done it. You are NTA for asking and he seriously misunderstands if he sees it as dehumanizing. It doesn\u2019t make him less of a man or a human in general to be respectful.", "NTA. \n\nI understand that he feels it is dehumanizing, and so that\u2019s his particular interpretation of the gesture. \n\nWhat is not ok is for him to be outraged at the suggestion and refuse to understand what the gesture means to you. For any kind of cross-cultural relationship to work, there has to be some willingness to understand that the same thing can mean something very different to different people. To you, this is a gesture of respect and there is nothing dehumanizing about it. \n\nHis unwillingness to understand that speaks to a rigidity and judgmental attitude that I think could be very problematic as time goes on. If he is going to be this reactive and harsh when these things come up, I can\u2019t imagine that the challenges of marriage long term, and child rearing if you want kids, are going to go smoothly.", "Are you making him bow or asking him to bow?\n\nNAH, if you\u2019re just asking. But if he doesn\u2019t want to participate in the tea session, you should respect your fianc\u00e9s wishes.\n\nAnd honestly, I totally see his point. What is viewed as one thing in Chinese culture, is another in American culture. You may view crouching to the ground and serving tea to your parents as a sign of respect. But most Americans (especially men) would view Crouching down to the ground and serving tea to people they barely know like reducing yourself to a servant/ low self respect/ultimate submission. \n\nRemember, he is not Chinese. The fact that he even participated in some of your cultural  traditions is impressive. But it doesn\u2019t mean he is obligated to do all of them. You can do it and he can just watch from a distance, he might be okay doing do standing, or he doesn\u2019t participate at all.\n\nYou should work with your fianc\u00e9 go find a mix between an American wedding and a Chinese wedding that you can agree on.", "**NAH** \\- It is OK to suggest it and OK for him to reject it.  You have different cultures.  My best suggestion is to follow the customs of where you live.  If that is America, then use American customs where no man bows to another.  In China, use Chinese customs.", "NTA. My french born Chinese cousins both married white French men. Both men bowed during the \"tea ceremony\".\n\nI understand how he might feel uncomfortable (and I know things may be different since I'm live in France), but have you explained clearly what the ceremony entails? That it doesn't require him to bow till his forehead touches the floor (at least not in my family's traditions haha). That it is also the time for our family to gift us money and wish good fortune. It might ease his concerns\n\nIf he still feels strongly against it, you might want to engage in a serious conversation regarding what aspects of our culture he accepts and what accepts he refuses to take part. (The same goes for your future children). I feel like my cousins' husbands agreed to the \"tea ceremony\" mostly because they wanted to embrace our culture and they respect it\n\nHope the conversation goes well with your fiance", "In your culture, it's normal.  In others, it's dehumanising. \n\nExplain to him how important this is to you. Explain to him the tradition. Show him articles about how this tradition started and why it's so important.  Of her still doesn't want to do it. Then you can't make him. \n\nIt will be your decision on what is more important to you.", "NAH. It was fine to ask, but don\u2019t press the issue. He doesn\u2019t want to bow down to someone- that\u2019s understandable. Find another tradition to honor your culture at your wedding.", "YTA.   The key word here is \"making\":  *AITA for* ***making*** *my fianc\u00e9 bow to my parents on my wedding day.\"*  If you want to show respect to your parents, feel free to bow to them.  But your fianc\u00e9 has declined to do so because he feels it is dehumanizing. He can show his respect to them in other ways, such as by publicly thanking them at the reception.", "NAH\n\nCrazy how people think its disrespecful that he is not down for that. In your culture, it might be something nice and valueable. But crouching and bowing is seen very negative in many white cultures. Irish + american is like the double slavery experience.", "Don\u2019t listen to anyone making your fianc\u00e9 the villain, I will never do bowing to anyone and that will be a dealbreaker if my future husband insist on that. Just do something that makes the two of you comfortable.  Marriage is for two people \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA for pushing this so far. I have bowed in greeting to many Japanese and Chinese people, cool it's like a respectful greeting... But there is a ZERO percent chance I will EVER get on my knees and bow to the floor to a person for literally any reason. I am not beneath anyone.", "NAH. I also come from a culture with heavy emphasis on respecting elders, I too however would not be comfortable with bowing.", "Not sure which region your parents are from, but where I'm from the bride and groom's younger siblings and cousins will kneel to offer tea to the bride and groom after the bride and groom have served the elders. That, and your elders are supposed to gift gold or cash to you after you serve them. See what he thinks about *that*.\n\nI think your fiance is being ridiculous and overdramatic over a completely standard tea ceremony (dehumanising, really?) but I'm also Chinese so what do I know.", "No, you aren't *forcing* your fiancee to do this. You're just begging him to. \n\nHe won't do it.", "It's not dehumanizing and if he's not willing to have an actual discussion about it so you can understand his feelings, leave him before the wedding.\nNTA.  It sounds like he's not respecting you.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA!\n\n>However my fianc\u00e9 strongly denied it and said that it was dehumanising and called me an asshole for even suggesting that as it meant that I thought he didn\u2019t respect himself, which is untrue.\n\nI can understand him having a knee jerk negative response to the custom, but saying it's dehumanizing and calling you an asshole for suggesting it is a *wildly* over the top overreaction.\n\nLook - the western custom of \"giving the bride away\" could also easily be interpreted as dehumanizing; implying that the woman is property that gets handed off from man to man. But for plenty of modern brides/families that tradition is a loving way of showing respect for your father - exactly the way the tradition you're describing does!\n\nThis is a yellow flag for me - proceed with caution. I definitely agree with the folks suggesting that you do more due diligence on his views of your culture. It's possible this was a one-off argument in a heated moment, but...it might not be. Dudes who get all hot under the collar about respect can sometimes have some pretty gnarly underlying ideas about relationships and cultures.", "In western culture, bowing is a symbol of subservience.  Essentially...you're asking your husband to emasculate himself to your parents.  Whether that's the cultural intention from the Asian side of things is not relevant as you're asking 'why' your fiance, a westerner, is so against it.", "NTA and from his reaction I would interrogate whether he really respects your family and culture", "NAH. This is one of many culture clashes you and your Partner are likely to encounter in your Marriage and can only be navigated though with open communication and compromise on both sides.", "I'll never understand people who get involved in interracial or intercultural relationships and then refuse to acknowledge the other person's culture if it demands something of them. NTA. Your fiancee comes from a culture that does not emphasize humility and respect for elders as much as the Chinese culture. How will raising children with someone like him work out?", "NTA.\n\nI would rethink marrying someone who calls me an a**hole over something like this", "YTA for pushing it after he told you how strongly he was against it. He's marrying you, not your parents.", "You\u2019re NTA, but do you really want this marriage to a man who does not fully respect your culture? Tea ceremony is important in Chinese culture \u2014 and is the respect of elders. \n\nPerhaps premarital counseling is the best thing to move forward. This could be a good opportunity to uncover more of his core beliefs about family and culture.", "NTA: I\u2019m white/white-passing depending on perspective and this is nonsense. Does he think every time people bow to each other in Asia they are dehumanising themselves? Does he find being minimally respectful hard in general?", "NTA, and he\u2019s behaving very unreasonably - to the point that I want to say \u201cyou sure about this guy?\u201d", "NTA. If he can't follow one simple tradition for 5 seconds, there's going to be a lot more problems in your marriage. Don't get married to this guy.", "NTA\n\nHow is he going to marry someone with different cultural observances and be so ignorant?", "NTA. Be very careful about marrying someone who is vehemently against your culture. This makes me think he has the attitude that white American culture is \u201cright\u201d and \u201cabove\u201d, whereas your culture is \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d. As long as you are bending to fit his culture, he is happy, but the second you mention doing one thing to honor yours, he calls you an asshole.

Traditions hold sentimental value for those growing up with it but what\u2019s the real REASON to do those things? What is the meaning BEHIND the tradition. If it\u2019s awesome he might want to do it. \n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this: A little girl is watching her mom prepare a pot roast. She asked her mother, \u201cwhy did you cut off the ends\u201d. Her mother responds, \u201cI don\u2019t know, my mom always did.\u201d So little girl goes to grandma and asks, \u201cwhy did you cut the ends off your pots roasts?\u201d The grandma says, \u201cI don\u2019t know, my mother always did.\u201d So little girl asks great grandma, \u201cwhy did you cut off the ends of your pot roast?\u201d Great grandma responds, \u201cmy pan was too small.\u201d", "NTA for asking. Bowing is not de-humanizing. But Americans do tend to view it as subservience, which is why many bend the knee for the Almight in church, but no formal bowing anywhere else. \n\nWould you only being doing the tea ceremony for your parents? What if you did it for his as well to honor them? You would be bringing them into your cultural practices as the whole white dress and vows is his cultural practice.", "NTA with a small caveat.\n\nWhat you describe is not dehumanizing.  As you so rightly point out, it's simply the way people show respect to elders in your culture.  He's massively overreacting.\n\nHowever, that being said, this way of showing respect is very different from the way most Americans of  \"somewhere-in-Europe-a-few-generations-ago\" origins show respect to their parents.  Unless you practice your own culture in other ways (giving red envelopes and eating tasty food at Chinese New year doesn't count), then this request is going to be very uncomfortable for him. You've been in America long enough to notice that no one bows to anyone. Depending on how they've been raised and what media they might be consuming, some Americans seem to get weirdly (in my view) triggered by the concept of bowing.   Remember a few years back when there was a ridiculous (in my view) controversy when Barack Obama allegedly gave a polite bow in greeting to the King of Saudi Arabia on a state visit?  Maybe you're too young for that memory.  Obama was blasted by certain commentators who thought that his bow showed weakness and subservience.\n\nIf do not normally practice your culture in your fiance's presence, your wedding day might not be the best day to suggest a new cultural practice that he hasn't seen before.  Do you have time to help in ease into the idea before suggesting it again?", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s no different from shaking the hand or even hugging the father of your spouse, which nearly every groom at any wedding I\u2019ve ever been to does automatically. \n\nIt\u2019s no different from asking the bride\u2019s father\u2019s permission to propose/marry, which has been falling out of fashion lately, it\u2019s true, but is still viewed as a fairly typical and benign tradition in lots of the West.\n\nTell your husband that it\u2019s tradition in your culture, important to you, and would be an easy way to make your parents happy. It doesn\u2019t create some eternal bond of subservience. They won\u2019t be able to hold it over his head and exploit him. If anything, it makes me wonder if your fianc\u00e9 is the one who doesn\u2019t respect himself, if he\u2019s so wound up about this.", "YTA this is not his culture and when you told him about it, he let you know how he felt about it.\nIf you cannot respect this and think it\u2019s okay to keep pushing it then he should not be marrying you as you do not respect him", "Nta.Your not asking for much.Yoyre still allowing him to have the wedding he wants and you respect his culture so he should respect yours.It\u2019s disrespectful to you ,your culture and your parents.", "I'm an inmigrant married to an american born man, I'm catholic to a point that I married being a virgin. So to me the first dates were \"look this is me, this is my religion and this is my country (born in Italy), are you ok with this?\" \n\nSo the first question that I would ask is the ceremony is religious or cultural? And the second would be a heart to heart as to why he thinks it's dehumanising, because could it be that he interprets that the ceremony more than honor is to bend over? More than pay respect this could be seen by someone as \"surrender\" or be \"submisive\" (for a lack of a better word). Again if this isn't any of those then you have two choices, either to break up or find a compromise. \n\nSorry for the broken English, I'm in Italy currently and it's taking me a bit to not talk/write/think in Italian.", "NTA so your doing mostly the traditional western wedding and you ask one thing from your culture and its' \"dehumanizing\". I'm white as white can be and I can see the importance of bowing to your parents. ANd TBH it's not just a Chinese culture, there are plenty of cultures which do this. It's not a subservient thing, it's more or less thanking your parents for the sacrifices they made raising you. It's not just his wedding, it's yours to. I say tell him since he won't bow and respect your culture you will be wearing a traditional Chinese dress. Edit: I would sit down and talk to him if your culture is important to him. Imagine having kids and HE decides that they are going to be raised white and kept away from your traditions.", "YTA for anyone outside of ancestor-worshipping or elder-revering cultures this act would be a disgraceful humiliation.\n\nIt\u2019s not like wearing a different colour dress.  It\u2019s a hugely significant symbolic act.\n\nIs the meaning of the act something you wish to take into your marriage?  If it is, then you need more discussion.

I also married outside my religion and culture.  Integrating, in some sense, the two cultures is important and should not be ignored.\n\nIf there is no integration now, there will always be a separation and a distance.", "NTA as all you did was ask, sounds like you didn't pressure him after he gave a no, etc. His reaction on the other hand seems to be completely out of proportion and thus worrying. Does he react like that often when you're trying to discuss things in a normal and civilized manner?", "Nta. As a white person, born and raised in America with no real religious experience or interest, I would wholeheartedly embrace the culture/practices of my partner. Even if it would be something I\u2019m unfamiliar with, if it means showing them respect/love and embracing them I would be willing. You are not asking a lot of your partner and his calling it \u2018dehumanizing\u2019 speaks volumes. He doesn\u2019t respect you or your culture, I would seriously reconsider marrying this person. It will only get worse.", "Wow....like wow......hebis making such an issue out od bowing to your parents before they give you away for marriage.....", "NTA. I don't see how this is dehumanizing.  I think it's worth more conversations with him (maybe in pre-marital counseling) to get to the bottom of why he feels this way.\n\nYou also need to consider if you're willing to enter into a marriage with someone who isn't willing to partake in a simple custom that's important to you.  What will that look like for other customs, holiday traditions etc that you want to honor?", "NTA - you're doing nothing maliciously, he was insulting and that wasn't excusable. Without an apology, the rest is pointless because what he did isn't acceptable.\n\nIt's interesting for people who look at America and think there's no cultural behavior or tradition (I'm not saying you believe that, it's just something I see on a world stage and within the USA as a whole.)\n\nThe biggest ideological tenet, by far, is a general sense of independence from authority. My way of respecting my elders means making sure they are seated comfortably in public transportation, being mindful of physical struggles, opening doors (for everyone, but still), helping out in more insistently when I'm being hosted, etc.\n\nThat said, I have absolutely told my grandmother that she is wrong and that information she was told was harmful and dangerous - and I love her dearly, and try to call her whenever possible because she is kind, well meaning, and wants to be good to the world. I've refused contact with extended family members who were casually cruel without remorse, despite my parents' requests, because family is pointless without love and respect.\n\nI have been respectful of my partner's parents, despite my distaste for their treatment of said partner, for the sake of keeping the peace at my partner's request - but have inserted myself into conversations to be protective and not backed down.\n\nIf it meant that my partner would be hurt if I didn't do something for their parents' sake, and it didn't conflict with my core values, I would do it. If I was asked to bow to them, for any reason, I would find it antithetical to my upbringing where culturally and personally, I would have serious problems complying with the request.\n\nIt has been culturally engrained that kneeling before someone is to say I am lesser, I have less value, and that I am by my nature unequal to the person before me. That is NOT how you and your parents view it! That's fair, but it is a difference that needs to be understood by him specifically and communicated to you thoroughly.\n\nI'm not saying this to chastise you. Your request is valid. It's fair.

My relationship failed due to distance, but the split itself was highly amicable. When dealing with intercultural relationships, communication with these issues must always take place with the partner first because you can't make assumptions.

But doing one thing that would mean a LOT to you and your parents is humiliating to him. You and I know we\u2019ve been doing this our whole lives and don\u2019t consider it humiliating.

You\u2019re the one who\u2019s doing a white wedding and basically doing all western stuff in every other aspect of your lives.\n\nI agree with the commenters who say before you get married you should really have a talk about whether you and your kids will be allowed to be as Chinese as you want, or whether you\u2019re all just supposed to live/be what HE wants.", "So you're happy for you husband to resent you from day 1?
