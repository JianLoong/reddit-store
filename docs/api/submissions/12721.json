From the beginning they were terrible neighbors. They left trash in the hallway, played loud music past 1am, and argued constantly. Most of that I was willing to ignore bc we live in apartments. Its unfortunately to be expected aside from the late night music.  The walls are fairly soundproof so most of the time the noise is not the worst thing in the world. The landlords have talked to them and they had became more reasonable. However, they have two small children maybe around 5 and 6 if I had to guess and their children scream. All. Day. They scream and cry and fight with each other and the parents do nothing to stop them. I understand they are children but it cannot be good for them to be screaming like that constantly. It always seemed weird to me that there is rarely a quiet moment.\n \nWe've asked them several times politely to get them to stop but they never put a lot of effort into silencing their kids. We've contacted the office and have called the cops on really bad nights but it still doesn't let up. Well enough was enough. My hours recently changed to mornings and while my work schedule and getting sleep is not their concern, I should be allowed to expect to have a quiet night and neighborhood. Around 3AM, 2 hours before I had to get up, their kids started yelling. I could here them running around and banging spoons or something on pots and pans, which is almost a daily occurrence. The mother screamed at them to \"shut the fuck up!\" But they didn't stop. So I called CPS and told them I suspected they were being mistreated, which honestly was not a lie because it was concerning the amount of screaming coming from that house.\n\nI suspect they may have had the kids taken as for the past week there have been no screams from the kids. I told my fiance what I did and he thinks I shouldn't have done it. I asked some of our friends and my parents and they all say the same thing. I should have sucked it up and minded my own business. I didn't think I did anything wrong, but I feel that if their parents cared about them they wouldn't let them behave like that. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that things have been like this from the beginning. Their children have been like this since day one it is nothing new to anybody.\n\nEdit 2: I also want to clarify that I have only seen these children once when they moved in which in my mind has always been a red flag. I never called CPS bc I never heard them being beaten up or anything just their mother occasionally shouting at them, so I never knew for sure. I don't know the home situation, but everything from the very beginning did always seem very odd. I never hear them leave the apartment when I'm home on my off days (I have rotating off days) and I don't know what kind of jobs the parents have. I don't know a lot about CPS if I'm honest but I always thought they would do something if something needed to be done.", "created_utc": 1679271581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w2pjh/aita_for_calling_cps_on_my_neighbors/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For that reason I conclude that your main reason for calling CPS was to hopefully cause scare your neighbors into making the kids be quite, and actual concern for the kids was secondary and possibly a justification.

The police wouldn't do anything. To me, this says that the kids were not in any imminent danger. They were just loud. \n\nThe parents, however, were not parenting to the best of a satisfactory parent's ability. \n\nThe thing about CPS removing kids from their homes: It's traumatic for the kids. The siblings may not be placed together. They may not be placed in a safe foster home. It is common for kids in foster care to be abused or even trafficked. Calling CPS really should be the last resort, and used only when the kids are in imminent danger.", "NTA. There's more than enough red flags for CPS intervention.

I don't have children of my own but I knew a lot of kids in my neighborhood growing up. None of us were bad kids, even the ones who never wanted to be home. Yeah we would get into screaming matches and yell and laugh, that's what kids do, but like for me personally I was always waaaay too tired at the end of the night to be doing any screaming. It *did* always seem weird and a little off that that was the normal family function of that house. I made the call largely in part because of the screaming affecting my life, yes, but CPS was literally the last resort for me after almost half a year of that craziness", "I completely agree that removing kids from homes is traumatizing and should only be a last resort if the kids are in danger. But I disagree that reporting a suspicion to CPS should be a last resort. \n\nIn most places it takes multiple calls and weeks or even months for CPS to remove a child from a home, unless there is blatant danger (and most child abuse is not blatant to an outsider during a short home visit). At least in the US, there isn't enough DHS staff and foster homes for them to remove every single kid they get a call about. They don't even send someone out to the home for every single call they get. \n\nWe don't know what exactly OP heard through the walls and I've known plenty of kids who can scream and be loud for HOURS -- but for OP to have noticed that the parents were not controlling the kids at 3am, the kids are too young to care for themselves, and they have never seen the kids leave the apartment... for all we know the kids could have been in a terrible environment and OP's CPS call could have been the only call for help those kids would have received. \n\nI really encourage people to call CPS if you even minimally suspect a child is in danger. It can be anonymous and does not mean the kids will be automatically removed from the home. The US does have high rates of child abuse and neglect and we need to protect kids. Not just removing them from their homes! We need to fight for reform in the system and for more resources for parents instead of punishments, but I don't think the solution is to just look the other way when you suspect a kid might be struggling. \n\nIf OP truly had a concern about the kids' welfare and was truthful during the CPS call, NTA.", "Right I understand that.

It seemed odd from the beginning.  I know for a fact there are usually two adults in that apartment, and you're right they could be overwhelmed, but the fact that I never hear them try to calm the kids or hell even talk to them much at all is odd. I've heard them arguing, having sex, and yelling at the kids. I've heard a lot from that apartment, but I waited because I was trying to mind my own business. I waited because I never heard things break or the sound of skin being hit or loud crying, just screaming. Yes, I was annoyed with them, but I understand that's a fact of having neighbors in an apartment complex.", "They don\u2019t just take kids away while they investigate though, kids will only be removed from the home if serious red flags come up during home visits.", "I didnt call for the longest time because I know that's how kids are. I know they are loud and scream and fight with each other. I understand they're kids but for one I dont think they're in school because they're always home.

I\u2019m not anti home schooling but there needs to be a lot more oversight.  We may have rights to our children, but we have many more responsibilities towards them.  In extreme cases the children cannot even prove their identity if they are home birthed, home schooled and have never visited a doctor.  Look up Alecia Faith Pennington.", "> but for OP to have noticed that the parents were not controlling the kids at 3am, the kids are too young to care for themselves, and they have never seen the kids leave the apartment... for all we know the kids could have been in a terrible environment and OP's CPS call could have been the only call for help those kids would have received.\n\nMy first thought was the parents get high or drunk and pass out every night. I question OP\u2019s motives but she may have unwittingly done the right thing.", "They didn\u2019t say that only 100k were taken, they said 100k were taken with no found cause. So then 3% of kids checked result in being unnecessarily taken (although I\u2019d question how many of those were justifiably taken, it just couldn\u2019t be proven).", "so lets take them from one situation and put them in another where they are completely out of their comfort zone, \n\nTalk to the 16 year old that was raped by her foster father got pregnant and now Florida is saying she must have the child because good things come from rape when you get pregnant \n\nPlease explain to me how this is better?", "NTA. If the kids were taken away on \"I heard lots of screaming from their unit from above and am worried they're being mistreated\", they probably have an open file or an actual danger was found in the household. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if the kids have been there but CPS showing up gave mom and dad the opportunity to say \"If you don't shut up, the neighbours will hear you screaming again and call CPS, and they'll take you away next time\" or something.", "If the kids were taken, they had cause for concern.  If they can prove that there is no reason for this concern, the kids will be returned.  If not, that is on them and not on you. NTA", "NTA But you shouldn't have told anyone you did it.  Keep your mouth shut.  And you did those kids a favor.", "NTA. Curious why the children are not in school.", "Yeah sorry but YTA ... letting them scream is bad parenting but not CPS worthy.", "NTA. If you suspect a child is being neglect or abused (which it sounds like you did) you should always, always contact CPS.", "NTA. All cps will do from a call is check on the kids and the household. If everything is okay they will not be back unless called on again. But if they found neglect they will take the kids. As someone who\u2019s experienced that, it is the best thing for those babies and the right thing to do. It\u2019s possible for the parents to get them back or if not possible they are tried to be placed with family members and not separated from each other. NOT EVERYONE SHOULD BE A PARENT.", "Yta. I get that you don't like your neighbors but calling cps on them without a real reason is really messed up.", "OK so abuse is rampant in the system true but those kids were obviously being verbally abused at least no mom should tell there 5 yr old to shut the fuck up and if cps took them that quick there was a reason I was a foster child even with how obvious my own abuse was it took 2 years for them take me from my parents and even then it was only after I had to call the police on my dad cause he was beating my mom within An inch of her life", "CPS doesn\u2019t remove kids from a household because they\u2019re loud. If CPS took the kids it\u2019s because they were in immediate danger. It takes a lot of effort to take kids away from their family and it is incredibly traumatic. They don\u2019t do it for no reason.", "I\u2019m sorry but you as a past caseworker should know what you said is false if their called about mistreatment their going to investigate in some cases they will take the child while the investigation is still going", ">NTA. Contrary to what people may believe, CPS doesn\u2019t actually want to remove children from their homes. So if they really did get taken away, it was almost certainly for good reason.\n\nCPS as an institution doesn't want to. That said, I've encountered enough CPS workers who think they have a god-given duty to remove white-looking Hispanic kids from their homes to \"save\" them that I understand where the belief comes from", "Ehh, I feel like the correct thing to say may be that CPS only takes children when they feel they have good reason to suspect serious danger to the kids-- the system in theory is focused on keeping bio families together. Yes, there can be human error stemming from discriminatory biases, but to take the children there was probably more signs of abuse than just a noise complaint. Maybe those other signs happen to have innocent explanations and the CPS worker is wrong, but there was probably more to be found than the noise complaint. \n\nPlus OP doesn't say the race of her neighbour's, so we don't know if there was a possibility of bias or not.", "Just some info from someone who\u2019s parents had cos called on them while I was a kid in a non shite house hold. CPS comes in looks at the condition of the home speaks to each kid individually and in a group asks  Does anyone hurt you? Does anyone touch you inappropriately. Makes you show ur arms and legs to show there is no harm being done and then checks to see if there is food in the home. Mind u I live in a 10 person household with only 5 rooms. The house was a disaster. Majority of the time they only take if one of those things aren\u2019t adding up which is valid.", "It's disturbing that people are replying for sources as if bipoc aren't already discriminated in every single aspect of society that cps would just be the exception. For me growing up, mentioning you're gonna call dyfs meant you really wanted to mess up someone's family. (As in, a threat) My family already been threatened with it based on racial discrimination. I even recall a former coworker, who was a high risk pregnancy, telling me a healthcare worker at the obgyn she was at threatened to call dyfs because she was late to her appointment. She already works a full time job, has two other daughters, and the place was like a good hour away. And the worker wanna claim she's \"neglecting\" herself all because she had to reschedule an appointment, and she was late. It is very real.", "They use the same BS the cops do. \"Imminent Danger\" without ever having to prove what that danger was.", "Right? That shows a level of faith in the police department that I definitely don't have.", "As far as I knew though the cops never went inside or had a reason too. I'm sure they did the same thing they always did to us when we went over to talk. Peak just their head out and go \"yeah, what?\" Their unit is the same as ours which means the entrance is a halwllway that curves so even if the door was wide open it would be impossible to see inside all the way", "I don't know why you're hung up on not seeing them leave home. Do you stand in the hallway 24/7? Lots of people are home bodies so not leaving is normal.", "Well, that is just not true at all. If the only thing wrong in someone's house is dishes in the sink there is no way in Hell they would be taken. You obviously had NO clue what was actually going on with your friends or relatives or whoever you are making this up about. Maybe their kids said they beat them or sexually molested them. Of course all they would tell people is some lie about their house being slightly dirty and they did nothing wrong.", "I knew a DCFYS worker many years ago who called herself a baby snatcher. This BS is real.", "Yea, I grew up in northern Ontario and Quebec", "That is what happened to my family. Dirty supper dishes in the sink, coupled with the fact we just moved into the apartment in the bad part of the city, so the place also wasn\u2019t put together yet. No other investigation, and my siblings were taken that very same day. We\u2019re half-native. I wasn\u2019t taken cause I was 18yrs, and I was still living in the place and still going to school. So yes. They will take children with little more than \u2018dirty dishes\u2019, and no there wasn\u2019t anything else happening in the house. This happened in Winnipeg, Canada. Got the Children back months later, and the Native CPS office(which we asked to be with once kids were back) even told my parents \u2018We don\u2019t know why they took them, there was no investigation or anything to suggest abuse.\u2019 Moved out of that province right after the last day of school and haven\u2019t been back.", "Colorado cps took me for neglect quoting i shouldn't be around MY horse without supervision NOTE we lived on a farm", "Reading comprehension is difficult apparently", "How old were you?", "This is very area dependent. \n\nIn NYC for example they are constantly sued and constantly lose because they basically just take poor kids at random. \u201cSocial workers\u201d are paid so badly, for the city Col, they usually don\u2019t have social work degrees just random degrees like English. Apply do very minimal training. They are mostly white middle class raised mid 20s who have done a few hours of training and told they can make decisions on which children to remove. The turnover rate is atrocious and anyone with a real social work degree and willingness to stay in the career for more then 3 months will quickly become a supervisor. \n\nOnce a kid is removed parental rights are almost never terminated because reunification services are so bad they can not prove in court they have tried to reunify children. They literally can not provide basic services like parenting classes to parents trying to get kids back. There are so few judges that court dates can be months out and only have a few minutes at a time. Children are then basically returned at random. \n\nThere are plenty of places with qualified professionals doing their best to make good decisions, but let\u2019s not pretend the system works well for most people.", "NTA. All those people who are saying you should have minded your own business are idiots. In my state every adult is considered a mandated reporter. In my state, if you have reasonable suspicion that a child is being abused or neglected, you have a legal obligation to report it to the DCS hotline. It doesn\u2019t matter what your profession is (I know many states have certain professions that work with kids as mandated reporters but no one else). I realize this may not be the case where you live since every state/country has different laws.

Neglect is the single biggest category of abuse and just from what you've described they were being neglected. They were also being verbally and mentally abused.
