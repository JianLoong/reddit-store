However, things didn't exactly go as planned.\n\nMy boyfriend's family is pretty traditional, and they weren't too happy that we were having a baby out of wedlock. They've been pretty distant and cold towards me since the announcement, but I thought that maybe the baby shower would be a chance for us to bond and put our differences aside.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. From the moment I arrived, my boyfriend's aunt made snide comments about my age and how \"young mothers never know what they're doing.\" Then, his brother asked if I was planning on getting a job after the baby was born, implying that I was just going to mooch off my boyfriend for the rest of my life or something. \n\nThings really came to a head when my boyfriend's mom gave me a gift bag that was filled with baby clothes...in all pink. When I politely pointed out that we were having a boy, she rolled her eyes and said, \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nAt that point, I was done. I stood up and announced that I didn't feel welcome there and that I was leaving. My boyfriend tried to convince me to stay, but I was so upset that I just walked out. \n\nNow my boyfriend's family is calling me rude and ungrateful for storming out of my own baby shower, but I feel like they were the ones being disrespectful to me. I\u2019m especially hurt that my boyfriend\u2019s family thinks I can\u2019t even care for my own child.

Too bad you don't know the rule about being kind to the mother if you want to see the baby.\"", "NTA - OP, you didn't feel welcome because you weren't welcome.  Also - \n\n \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nThis is the strangest \"dig\" I've ever heard. Young moms not knowing the sex of their babies is...not a thing.", "NTA. The pink comment was ridiculous, and I don't understand why they are not equally disapproving of their son for having a child young and out of wedlock!", "The fact your boyfriend didn\u2019t tell his family to back down and stop treating you like shit is even worse than their behavior. You\u2019re NTA but your boyfriend\u2019s family is and I\u2019m even considering him one since he clearly didn\u2019t support you and stand up for you.", "NTA - while it might sound harsh, you need to have an immediate and serious conversation with your boyfriend about how he is going to handle the situation going forward. If he is not willing to immediately step up and advise his family to stop their crap and treat you with respect, then you would be very well advised to start preparing to be a single mother. Any person who would let their family treat their partner this way is not someone who will make a good parent. For your well-being and that of your child, this behavior needs to be corrected or they need to be removed from your life. You have no obligation to expose your child to their unkind treatment of you.", "NTA - Not sure what their problem is but that is not how you treat anyone, let alone family. If they have a problem they should talk to you directly instead of treating you like crap.", "NTA. They were rude, thoughtless and passive aggressive. You may very well be too young and have a lot to figure out but you also may be just fine. Either way you\u2019re having a baby. Congratulations! What they did wasn\u2019t ok and I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself. I think it\u2019s a sign of things to come. Set boundaries now. The pink clothing was especially spiteful. I\u2019m the type of person who would dress my son in those clothes (at least for pictures) just to get them back though. Don\u2019t let them get to you", "NTA. I think they are rude too.", "NTA but you need to make sure you draw up some pretty tight boundaries for after the birth. They don't get to disrespect you then play happy families.", "Why on earth would his mom waste money buying girl clothes if she knew you were having a boy? How did they honestly expect you to respond to all of their rude comments? These people are a bunch of weirdos and your boyfriend sucks for not defending you. NTA", "NTA. You need to have a serious boundary conversation with your boyfriend about his family. They do not like you & will try to meddle in your parenthood. There's a subreddit called justnomil that you'd benefit from checking out. A lot of times this is a make or break situation. If your boyfriend defends you had your back & keeps his family away from you, you're in good shape. If he agrees with them or defends them or asks that you sacrifice your sense of well-being for his family then you're in trouble & really should check out that subreddit! Best of luck congrats on the baby. Don't let people make you feel small because you're young. Being a mom at 19 isn't the end of the world. I hope his family is in for a rude awakening thinking they can treat you this way. It is your partners job to keep his family in line. I hope he is on your team. There's nothing worse than having a baby with someone who puts their family of origin ahead of you.", "Nta. I'm so sorry they are treating you this way. Just bc you are young doesn't mean you won't be a great mother! Sending you hugs,  you are in for a bumpy ride w his family I'm afraid.", "NTA but the way bigger problem than your bf's family is your boyfriend. He didn't step up for you or defend you AND tried to make you stay to take more abuse? Talk about yikes. You have a big relationship problem here.", "NTA-they were being rude. No one should have to sit through that baby shower or not.", "NTA\u2014 your boyfriend\u2019s family is full of assholes. Your boyfriend is also an asshole for not reprimanding them. \n\nWhat they said to you is completely not ok and unkind. \n\nI wish you all the best with the baby.", "NTA\n\nWas your boyfriend's family rude? Absolutely.\n\nWere you completely justified in leaving early? Also, yes.\n\nWill this be the last time that someone makes a rude comment about you being a parent at your age? Unfortunately, not. \n\nYou're going to have get a little tougher about dealing with these comments. In two months or less, you are no longer you. You are 'we'. These people will be your babies family members, and a potential source of babysitting and support for you. You'll have to learn to set boundaries and not let stupid comments get you upset. \n\nYou have no obligation to satisfy their curiosity. \n\nSomeone hands you a giftbag, the response is 'thank you'. Then return, exchange, sell or donate; they don't need to know. \n\nThese people are not your friends or family, so reset your expectations. \n\nEverything is going to change rapidly in about two months. Rely on your own friends and family; anything from the bf's family is a nice bonus but not obligatory or reliable. \n\nYou set the boundaries for yourself and your baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend needs to man up and stand up to them.  I hope you will make it clear that his family are not welcome in your life due to their disrespect.", "NTA. I mean seriously what did your BF think was going to happen when his family was being so rude to you. I am sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nWhere do they have the audacity to call you rude when your so-called baby shower was just them shitting on you? Beliefs and circumstances aside, to go that far out of the way to make you feel bad is downright cruel.\n\nIMO you should set a hard boundary with your bf that you will be having minimal, if any, contact with his family. The same goes for your baby. Those people won't be a good influence and will undoubtedly cause issues in your life. Find a more supportive system for you and your baby. Hell, I'll crochet a baby blanket if you need it.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and endure passive aggressive comments or insults for anyone, in any situation. Just because they made the effort to come to your baby shower does not give them a free pass to be AH\u2019s. Sure you could politely ask them not to make comments but that could lead to more conflict, I think removing yourself from the situation was probably the best call.", "NTA. You did the right thing getting out of there but maybe have a talk with your boyfriend and try to work out boundaries and having him discuss it with them.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need to have people commenting, or implying anything negative.\n\nYou're young and will eventually learn how to handle the situation better; but for now, you're not in the wrong for removing yourself from that environment.\n\nThere was no mention of (or maybe I missed it), where you told your bf what was happening. If you said nothing to him, he can't defend you; or mitigate the situation by telling the family members to quit being rude & passive-aggressive to you. You definitely want to communicate that behavior to him, so he can either see their actions himself, or be in proximity to negate what they might tell you when he's not around.\n\nI hope he sees that, now; and you can move forward, together, as a team.", "NTA. I hope you and your husband (and son) have love and support from your family and friends and that his family wises up quickly. That wasn\u2019t a baby shower\u2014that was an excuse for them to act disrespectfully.", "NTA. I'm sorry they treated you this way.  I had my first son at 19. Don't let anyone make you think you can't do a great fucking job as a parent.  You can,  and you will.  My son is almost 17 now.  He's in jrotc as an airman second class.  He's enlisting next year with plans to be a medic in the army.  He's kind,  compassionate,  a great older brother. He's a good man,  and that's because I was a good mom. It's going to be hard.  It's going to be lonely. You ARE going to struggle like you never realized you could struggle.  But you CAN do this.  Ignore them and be the best damn mother anyone has ever seen.  You put your son first by putting yourself first starting now.  If your bf isn't going to be supportive and protect you from this,  make a plan and do it on your own.  I did,  you can.  Your whole life is going to change, but every single minute of struggle will be worth it.  I promise.", "NTA. It sucks that they were being mean. But I hope you do realize the enormity of your situation, and I hope your boyfriend is supportive. Raising a child is no joke, and you are very young. I wish you the best.", "I always had (and have) a sharp tongue, so everybody would have gotten answers in kind. But i also know not everybody is this way. They where mean to you, your bf should get a backbone and you're NTA.", "NTA but your BF is.", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019re feeling very attacked and you were.  But these awful people will be your child\u2019s family so you will need to learn to deal with them until you decide to go no contact.  When dealing with rude people, my go to is to either straight faced respond with \u201cwhat an odd thing to say, could you explain what you mean by that\u201d.  People like this will then act as if you\u2019re the aggressor.  Just keep repeating that you\u2019d like the comment explained.  Just keep pretending that everything they say is as if they really care and respond in kind.  For instance, \u201cis it your experience or did you read about young moms not knowing the sex of their babies?  Next time just ask, I\u2019m happy to share with you.  Now that you know you\u2019re going to have a grandson do you want to return these or should I? Honey, mom bought kiddo lovely things but you should have told her we\u2019re having a boy!  \u201c \n\nIf you get mad at them, you lose.  Your boyfriend better step though, he needs to be your and baby\u2019s protector now.", "INFO: What was your boyfriend's reaction to the events at the baby shower?", "NTA", "NTA.  Also don't let comments about your age bother you. My daughter got preggers at 16, married at 17, and still as in love 14 years later as they were as teens. She is an amazing mother to 4 boys and you can do it too. Decide what kind of mother your baby deserves and then do your best to be that mother. You'll be fine!", "All those comments they made were extremely rude and offensive. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t let any of them near me or my baby if I were you. Forget them!!!! Best wishes to you and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA. I\u2019d be having a sit down with the boyfriend and going over respect, boundaries, and expectations. If he\u2019s not on your side, I am sure you\u2019ll do fine on your own. I hope that the family and friends on your side are kind and supportive, I wouldn\u2019t count on his side for anything.", "NTA. Does your baby dad have the power of speech? He needs to shut that shit down now. If he\u2019s ok with that behavior, you need to ask yourself if you want to be treated this way for at least 18 years.", "I'll give a (probably unpopular) ESH here.  Your bf's family were definitely TA for their comments and the way they treated you.  But they weren't wrong that you're way too young to have a baby.  \n\nBabies are expensive.  Like, really expensive.  Are you and your bf in a financial position to spend thousands of dollars a year on clothes, food, furniture, and everything else a baby needs?\n\nAnd they consume all of your time.  Is your boyfriend mature enough to give up a big chunk of his free time to help you with the baby?  No more nights out drinking with friends or videogames until 3am.  \n\nThat said, I hope it all goes well for you and your baby and that you prove me wrong.", "Not enough info...was it just his family throwing you the shower,  then NTA.\n\nIf you had other guests there then YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
