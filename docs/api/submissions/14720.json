They've been pretty distant and cold towards me since the announcement, but I thought that maybe the baby shower would be a chance for us to bond and put our differences aside.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. From the moment I arrived, my boyfriend's aunt made snide comments about my age and how \"young mothers never know what they're doing.\" Then, his brother asked if I was planning on getting a job after the baby was born, implying that I was just going to mooch off my boyfriend for the rest of my life or something. \n\nThings really came to a head when my boyfriend's mom gave me a gift bag that was filled with baby clothes...in all pink. When I politely pointed out that we were having a boy, she rolled her eyes and said, \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nAt that point, I was done. I stood up and announced that I didn't feel welcome there and that I was leaving. My boyfriend tried to convince me to stay, but I was so upset that I just walked out. \n\nNow my boyfriend's family is calling me rude and ungrateful for storming out of my own baby shower, but I feel like they were the ones being disrespectful to me.

Too bad you don't know the rule about being kind to the mother if you want to see the baby.\"", "NTA - OP, you didn't feel welcome because you weren't welcome.  Also - \n\n \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nThis is the strangest \"dig\" I've ever heard. Young moms not knowing the sex of their babies is...not a thing.", "NTA. The pink comment was ridiculous, and I don't understand why they are not equally disapproving of their son for having a child young and out of wedlock!", "The fact your boyfriend didn\u2019t tell his family to back down and stop treating you like shit is even worse than their behavior. You\u2019re NTA but your boyfriend\u2019s family is and I\u2019m even considering him one since he clearly didn\u2019t support you and stand up for you.", "NTA - while it might sound harsh, you need to have an immediate and serious conversation with your boyfriend about how he is going to handle the situation going forward. If he is not willing to immediately step up and advise his family to stop their crap and treat you with respect, then you would be very well advised to start preparing to be a single mother. Any person who would let their family treat their partner this way is not someone who will make a good parent. For your well-being and that of your child, this behavior needs to be corrected or they need to be removed from your life. You have no obligation to expose your child to their unkind treatment of you.", "NTA - Not sure what their problem is but that is not how you treat anyone, let alone family. If they have a problem they should talk to you directly instead of treating you like crap.", "NTA. They were rude, thoughtless and passive aggressive. You may very well be too young and have a lot to figure out but you also may be just fine. Either way you\u2019re having a baby. Congratulations! What they did wasn\u2019t ok and I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself. I think it\u2019s a sign of things to come. Set boundaries now. The pink clothing was especially spiteful. I\u2019m the type of person who would dress my son in those clothes (at least for pictures) just to get them back though. Don\u2019t let them get to you", "NTA. I think they are rude too.", "NTA but you need to make sure you draw up some pretty tight boundaries for after the birth. They don't get to disrespect you then play happy families.", "Why on earth would his mom waste money buying girl clothes if she knew you were having a boy? How did they honestly expect you to respond to all of their rude comments? These people are a bunch of weirdos and your boyfriend sucks for not defending you. NTA", "NTA. You need to have a serious boundary conversation with your boyfriend about his family. They do not like you & will try to meddle in your parenthood. There's a subreddit called justnomil that you'd benefit from checking out. A lot of times this is a make or break situation. If your boyfriend defends you had your back & keeps his family away from you, you're in good shape. If he agrees with them or defends them or asks that you sacrifice your sense of well-being for his family then you're in trouble & really should check out that subreddit! Best of luck congrats on the baby. Don't let people make you feel small because you're young. Being a mom at 19 isn't the end of the world. I hope his family is in for a rude awakening thinking they can treat you this way. It is your partners job to keep his family in line. I hope he is on your team. There's nothing worse than having a baby with someone who puts their family of origin ahead of you.", "Nta. I'm so sorry they are treating you this way. Just bc you are young doesn't mean you won't be a great mother! Sending you hugs,  you are in for a bumpy ride w his family I'm afraid.", "NTA but the way bigger problem than your bf's family is your boyfriend.

Absolutely.\n\nWere you completely justified in leaving early? Also, yes.\n\nWill this be the last time that someone makes a rude comment about you being a parent at your age? Unfortunately, not. \n\nYou're going to have get a little tougher about dealing with these comments. In two months or less, you are no longer you. You are 'we'. These people will be your babies family members, and a potential source of babysitting and support for you. You'll have to learn to set boundaries and not let stupid comments get you upset. \n\nYou have no obligation to satisfy their curiosity. \n\nSomeone hands you a giftbag, the response is 'thank you'. Then return, exchange, sell or donate; they don't need to know. \n\nThese people are not your friends or family, so reset your expectations. \n\nEverything is going to change rapidly in about two months. Rely on your own friends and family; anything from the bf's family is a nice bonus but not obligatory or reliable. \n\nYou set the boundaries for yourself and your baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend needs to man up and stand up to them.  I hope you will make it clear that his family are not welcome in your life due to their disrespect.", "NTA. I mean seriously what did your BF think was going to happen when his family was being so rude to you. I am sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nWhere do they have the audacity to call you rude when your so-called baby shower was just them shitting on you? Beliefs and circumstances aside, to go that far out of the way to make you feel bad is downright cruel.\n\nIMO you should set a hard boundary with your bf that you will be having minimal, if any, contact with his family. The same goes for your baby. Those people won't be a good influence and will undoubtedly cause issues in your life. Find a more supportive system for you and your baby. Hell, I'll crochet a baby blanket if you need it.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and endure passive aggressive comments or insults for anyone, in any situation. Just because they made the effort to come to your baby shower does not give them a free pass to be AH\u2019s. Sure you could politely ask them not to make comments but that could lead to more conflict, I think removing yourself from the situation was probably the best call.", "NTA. You did the right thing getting out of there but maybe have a talk with your boyfriend and try to work out boundaries and having him discuss it with them.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need to have people commenting, or implying anything negative.\n\nYou're young and will eventually learn how to handle the situation better; but for now, you're not in the wrong for removing yourself from that environment.\n\nThere was no mention of (or maybe I missed it), where you told your bf what was happening. If you said nothing to him, he can't defend you; or mitigate the situation by telling the family members to quit being rude & passive-aggressive to you. You definitely want to communicate that behavior to him, so he can either see their actions himself, or be in proximity to negate what they might tell you when he's not around.\n\nI hope he sees that, now; and you can move forward, together, as a team.", "NTA. I hope you and your husband (and son) have love and support from your family and friends and that his family wises up quickly. That wasn\u2019t a baby shower\u2014that was an excuse for them to act disrespectfully.", "NTA. I'm sorry they treated you this way.  I had my first son at 19. Don't let anyone make you think you can't do a great fucking job as a parent.  You can,  and you will.  My son is almost 17 now.  He's in jrotc as an airman second class.  He's enlisting next year with plans to be a medic in the army.  He's kind,  compassionate,  a great older brother. He's a good man,  and that's because I was a good mom. It's going to be hard.  It's going to be lonely. You ARE going to struggle like you never realized you could struggle.  But you CAN do this.  Ignore them and be the best damn mother anyone has ever seen.  You put your son first by putting yourself first starting now.  If your bf isn't going to be supportive and protect you from this,  make a plan and do it on your own.  I did,  you can.  Your whole life is going to change, but every single minute of struggle will be worth it.  I promise.", "NTA. It sucks that they were being mean. But I hope you do realize the enormity of your situation, and I hope your boyfriend is supportive. Raising a child is no joke, and you are very young. I wish you the best.", "I always had (and have) a sharp tongue, so everybody would have gotten answers in kind. But i also know not everybody is this way. They where mean to you, your bf should get a backbone and you're NTA.", "NTA but your BF is.", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019re feeling very attacked and you were.  But these awful people will be your child\u2019s family so you will need to learn to deal with them until you decide to go no contact.  When dealing with rude people, my go to is to either straight faced respond with \u201cwhat an odd thing to say, could you explain what you mean by that\u201d.  People like this will then act as if you\u2019re the aggressor.  Just keep repeating that you\u2019d like the comment explained.  Just keep pretending that everything they say is as if they really care and respond in kind.  For instance, \u201cis it your experience or did you read about young moms not knowing the sex of their babies?  Next time just ask, I\u2019m happy to share with you.  Now that you know you\u2019re going to have a grandson do you want to return these or should I? Honey, mom bought kiddo lovely things but you should have told her we\u2019re having a boy!  \u201c \n\nIf you get mad at them, you lose.  Your boyfriend better step though, he needs to be your and baby\u2019s protector now.", "INFO: What was your boyfriend's reaction to the events at the baby shower?", "NTA", "NTA.  Also don't let comments about your age bother you. My daughter got preggers at 16, married at 17, and still as in love 14 years later as they were as teens. She is an amazing mother to 4 boys and you can do it too. Decide what kind of mother your baby deserves and then do your best to be that mother. You'll be fine!", "All those comments they made were extremely rude and offensive. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t let any of them near me or my baby if I were you. Forget them!!!! Best wishes to you and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA. I\u2019d be having a sit down with the boyfriend and going over respect, boundaries, and expectations. If he\u2019s not on your side, I am sure you\u2019ll do fine on your own. I hope that the family and friends on your side are kind and supportive, I wouldn\u2019t count on his side for anything.", "NTA. Does your baby dad have the power of speech? He needs to shut that shit down now. If he\u2019s ok with that behavior, you need to ask yourself if you want to be treated this way for at least 18 years.", "I'll give a (probably unpopular) ESH here.  Your bf's family were definitely TA for their comments and the way they treated you.  But they weren't wrong that you're way too young to have a baby.  \n\nBabies are expensive.  Like, really expensive.  Are you and your bf in a financial position to spend thousands of dollars a year on clothes, food, furniture, and everything else a baby needs?\n\nAnd they consume all of your time.  Is your boyfriend mature enough to give up a big chunk of his free time to help you with the baby?

Maybe he hasn't put together the big picture that you two are starting your very own family, distinct (not necessarily separate) from his nuclear family.  When he thinks about what he wants his own family to look like, what kind of father and partner to you does he want to be?   What kind of partner do you want for your new family?  There are ways to tell family you love and respect them while, at the same time, telling them you must also insist on deciding on your own what's best for you - he doesn't have to choose unless someone makes him choose.

Can't you just go on the pill and suffer all those side effects so my pee pee gets a better tingle? Fine I'll just pull out, it will be fine.'\n\nWith such an effective barrier method when used correctly, we really need to put the blame majority of the time on the young father. Yes, they woman gave into their dumb idea, but there is so much pressure because so many men expect in a relationship (or even not in a relationship) that forgoing a condom is ok. And they often come into the bedroom with a game plan to avoid a condom and in the heat of the moment pull the old 'oh it's just not working, oh butter fingers, oh it's gone down, let's just pull out'.\n\nJust this one time turns into a way to cajole for just every time. That's a lot to put on a young woman and especially hypocritical when coming from Christians who keep blaming Eve for pressuring Adam to eat an apple, and ignore that Eve, the woman, was convinced by the second most powerful being in the universe, but poor Adam, the boobies said to do it, so he did.\n\nOh it's our fault mythical Adam felt pressured by his gf to eat an apple. And it's our fault for buckling under the pressure to go without a condom by our real immature boyfriends. I want equal rules, if Adam can get socially pressured consequence free, I want to be measured by that same measuring stick, I'll take mythical original sin blame because some bint eons ago was so convincing after the devil manipulated her for millennia to eat the fruit, and men can wear the responsibility for the stupidly didn't wear a condom defence.\n\nOP, his family are judgemental dicks.

She showed his mom and stepdad (no sex out of wedlock because God said so but you can totally get divorced I guess) the ultrasound of their first grandbaby and she took my friend by the hands and said \"I just pray that God will forgive you for fornicating outside of marriage.\" Her son ejaculated inside my friend without telling her but it was HER fault for getting pregnant. I wanted to pull her out of there and tell that woman that, clearly, I was going to hell with that logic. I can tell you right now you will never matter to this family until the baby becomes real to them. A baby means control to these kinds of people. Allow me to give more insight.\n\nThis demonic woman went on to steal my friend's first mother's day from her when she was almost to term, tried to take away the newborn from her in the hospital after her C-section because \"she's held him enough he NEEDS ME\", later became jealous that my friend's own mom held the baby before her, took over the baby events, and my friend's worth as the mother of her son's child.

He never stood up for his girlfriend. He witnessed his family shame her, put her down, steal precious moments from her and her child, and did nothing time and time and time again. He made her stay at events, despite how unwelcome she felt because at least the kid was included. You two, and soon to be three, should have a serious conversation about this.

This is anthropology 101 enacted. For thousands of years human cultures that have thrived have set up systems to provide maximal chances for babies and mothers to survive and thrive. You probably know the systems in our society: paternity, marriage, good relations with extended families, sacrifices for education, child support laws, social safety nets, etc. They come with varying degrees of surrendered autonomy.\n\nAnd for thousands of years a minority of teenagers and young adults have decided autonomy is more important than those protective/supportive systems. Those parents take a more challenging course, with higher maternal and child poverty rates, and a higher likelihood that the child will be back here in 15 years seeking redditor endorsement for him to hate whichever adults his mother is associated with at that time. I think other societies have had better child-raising support systems than ours, but we are who we are.\n\nIt may be still possible to access the social support system, but you have discovered it's harder if you don't follow the prescribed order. Talk to your boyfriend about a stronger commitment for ongoing support (i.e., marriage, his name on baby's birth certificate, living in a place with stronger child support laws, him focusing his 20s on improving his earning status). Ask for his participation in developing a positive relationship with both of your extended families (show friendliness, interest in them, respect for their opinions, appreciation for help, overlooking small misssteps, putting charitable construction on ambiguous behaviors, etc).\n\nYou are of course free to reject this advice and put autonomy above all else. If you just came here to find some redditors to endorse your feeling disrespected because your boyfriend's mother did not know the sex of the baby, i am sure some will agree. Did you or her son not tell her the sex of the baby?  Was she regifting something at hand? Would it matter to you if we remind you that there have been western societies that dressed boy babies in pink, or that orthodox redditors frown on following gender stereotypes? \n\nCongratulations on your blessed event and best wishes.", "NTA. But they certainly are. Just as an aside, my husband's mom had her two kids when she was 17 (my BIL) and 19 (my husband). And one of my best friends had a kid when she was 15. And they are two of the best mothers I have ever met. Please don't let them get into your head. You've got this! And if they keep this up, sounds to me like NC is in order and if they are upset they don't get to meet your baby, that's on them.", "Why should you br grateful for snide remarks?\n\nNo amount of gifts should make you stay for that.\n\nYou exercised your right to leave and even told them why.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Nta\n\nIt always makes me laugh when in law family judge the mum for being pregnant. Their son is the one who is shagging a 19yr old, outside of marriage, with not enough protection. Takes 2 to tango, and get pregnant, and decide to keep it. \n\nSounds gross. Don't blame you for leaving. Have another one with your friends and family and I wouldn't bother with them! Congratulations on your baby, I hope you're both happy and healthy x", "NTA. \n\nFor starters, not everyone HAS to have a gender reveal or wherever the hell. My wife and I CHOSE to not find out the sex of either of our children (both were boys) because we didn\u2019t care about the sex. We were happy to be having children. That\u2019s all. It made zero difference to how much we\u2019d love them. \n\nSecondly\u2026 why are his parents and family being shitty with you about being pregnant? It takes two to tango. Did they not take biology? Don\u2019t they know their precious boy that they think you\u2019ll mooch off is the one that put the baby in there? \n\nI\u2019ve had to deal with similar issues with my in-laws. You wont ever please these people, and it\u2019s a waste of your time and energy even worrying about it. Just go with the flow where needed, and you make sure yourself and your child are the priority in your life. Whatever the in-laws think\u2026 you can\u2019t change it. They\u2019re definitely the AH here. You aren\u2019t. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with your baby. Congratulations to you and your partner.", "NTA\n\nWhat does your BF say when his family says these things to you? Did this event only have his family and none of yours? I thought baby showers were for both families. \nI hope BF has your back!!!", "Oh wow @OogaBooga will love this for his next video", "NTA that was pretty blatant bullying", "What kind of weird remark is that about not being old enough to know the sex of your baby?? That is so dumb it doesn\u2019t even make sense. Your dr is probably not 19, and even still, sometimes even dr.\u2019s get it wrong. \n\nAs far as the brother asking if you were gonna get a job after the birth of the baby, maybe he was just asking if you were going to be a SAHM?", "NTA. Does your boyfriend realise his family was making digs at you about how they didn't think you could be a good mother the whole night? It might be he just missed the subtext of everything while he was occupied with other family members and they told him after you left that you just blew up because they got the gender wrong, rather than because of the snide comments", "NTA. They were boorish and rude hosts.", "NTA", "NTA. Wows they are unkind", "Nta fuck those worthless people", "How do they do blindly forget that you couldn\u2019t have gotten pregnant without THEIR son.", "NTA\nAlso your boyfriend should stick up for you and his baby.\nI'd be ashamed for family if they acted like that.", "NTA\n\nYou are definitely not in the wrong for defending yourself and leaving your boyfriend needs to do more to defend you. What they are doing and saying to you is not acceptable.\n\nAge doesn't matter when it comes to parenting. I have friends who had a child at 16 They are 32 now and their child  is now 16 and  are thriving I also have an acquaintance of a friend who is 39 and has had all her children removed from her care.\n\nWe don't get parenting books when the child is born. It is literally a learn as you go and it doesn't matter how many children you have Each child is bloody different Don't let anyone ever make you feel like you are not good enough as a mother.\n\nHold your head up high. Put a big smile on your face and I wish you all the best you are going to smash it as a mother", "RUN. Just run, op. It\u2019s not going to get any better. Run", "NTA and I hope you are aware that you do not have to stay with this boyfriend just because of the baby. These people do not respect you, please don\u2019t let your child see you being disrespected by his own family", "NTA\n&You're boyfriend should have stood up for you.", "NTA. Sounds like there's a LOT of people who aren't going to be seeing your kid anytime soon after the birth. Seriously you need to sit your boyfriend down and let him know they need to shape up and stop being jackasses or they won't be seeing the baby for the foreseeable future. \n\nAnd if he doesn't stand up to them and back you up like he should be, then he better be prepared to be a single parent. You don't need to stay with someone that won't stand up for you when their family is obnoxious passive aggressive twats to you.\n\nThese problems with his family aren't going to just go away. You're gonna have to set them straight and both you and your bf get on the same page. Otherwise you're just gonna be miserable going forward", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re kinda stuck with those people. Hopefully you don\u2019t have to see them too often.", "NTA.\n\nI had my first at 19 too, and I completely feel you. It's truly amazing, some of the shit people feel like they can get away with saying when you're young and pregnant. \n\nGood for you for walking out. There was no reason to treat you that way.", "NTA.  And dont let them make you question yourself for it, either.  You showed a lot of backbone for the situation you were in combined with your age.  Good on you, and good luck with the little one.", "NTA, babies don't always bring out the good in people.  I feel that they see you as a gold digger that got pregnant on purpose. Don't be surprised if they never accept you or your baby.", "Lmao next time someone says anything about her being a young mom, she should just say, \"Oh, you'd rather I have an abortion then?\" If they're so *traditional*, chances are they're also forced-birthers. That would get em to back track real quick and mind their business.", ">My boyfriend's family is pretty traditional\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet he was the one who was involved in premarital sex. But they are only going to take it out on you, because the son can do no wrong /s\n\nNTA.", "I had my son at 19 my husband was 21; he died at 26 I had to raise my son alone, he turned up to be a great human.  I sometimes blame my self for feeling like i was growing up at the same time he was and there was some level of immaturity.  Well guess what! My son is now a young adult and loves that he has a young mom, he recently told me I was his best friend, this made my tear <3 and he is extremely grateful for me also becoming a good human at the same time that I was raising him.  What I learned after all this years is that no matter the age; first time mothers we are all winging it and learning as we go.  You will do great no matter what they think.  Teach your son the value of respect and don\u2019t allow any one to disrespect you for any reason even less for your age.  If they don\u2019t treat you better cut them off. You will have your hands full and you don\u2019t need that bad energy around you.", "NTA. They were straight up gaslighting you and being rude. BF's family is traditional but BF isn't?", "NTA.\n\nBF's family are AH. BF is only 21 himself and you didn't get pregnant on your own. If they have such problems with your age, they should criticize your BF for sleeping with you and get you pregnant, but they only target you. And that you allegedly wouldn't know the sex of the baby because of your age was just weird.", "Also OP did your boyfriend not tell his mother you were having a boy?", "The correct response is \u201coh, well, I just assumed you forgot because you are so old\u201d", "Unfortunately the child will still be hearing nasty comments about their mother from this family when the father has him. If they can't control themselves now I don't expect them to in five years.  People need to do better.", "This!!!", "I agree with the NTA.\n\nBut what did your boyfriend do about all of this? Just stood there quietly while they insulted you? Did he leave with you?\nSince you are both so young (I have no doubt you'll be a great mom), he may not necessarily be a lost cause, he may simply have never thought about it.\n\nIt is something really important for you to think about. Your IL may or may not come around, you don't have to see them if they don't. Staying with someone who backs up those who insult you and asks you to take it in order to \"not rock the boat\" is always a bad idea though.", "She did set the boundaries, she left. Thanking her boyfriends mum for being rude with the gift would be setting herself up for being walked all over.", "We don\u2019t know that she \u201cstormed out\u201d. She said she left, which I think was a good move.", "Boomers had kids at 19 on purpose. Why suddenly is that too young to know anything? Mom probably thinks her kid is being baby trapped. The best revenge is a life lived well. Don't bother with including them anymore OP. NTA.", "She's having a baby at 19 lol\n\n\nWe are on the first stop of a Trainwreck.", "I had to do something similar but with my step kids. My family doesn\u2019t like my boyfriend, which is fine. Except they don\u2019t treat him with any respect at all. And I confronted them several times and let them know repeatedly I didn\u2019t appreciate how they treated him and that I was taking it personally. Well, he has three kids from a previous marriage and they are the best kids in the universe. I love them soo much. My mom LOVES kids, wanted to have a daycare, etc. she has no grandkids in her life at all by my siblings. The only kids in our family right now are my step kids, who my parents only met once. They aren\u2019t welcoming for friendly to my boyfriend,  so whenever we have the kids with us I don\u2019t really let my parents know - my boyfriend doesn\u2019t want my parents to be around them and I respect that because of the history. But I don\u2019t lie. If my mom asks what I\u2019ve been up to when we have the kids, I let her know they\u2019re staying with us and what we\u2019ve been up to. But I don\u2019t invite them to see the kids, and it makes my mom pretty mad. She usually stops talking to me for a couple weeks after the kids have been here and she finds out. \n\nHonestly I was so excited for my mom to get to be around kids since they make her so happy. But actually reflecting on my own childhood, I am standing by my choice to keep that line drawn hard. It sucks that my family isn\u2019t normal but I love my step kids and I will protect them from crappy people if it\u2019s in my power to.\n\nEdit to add: things with my parents have been getting better slowly between them and my boyfriend. They saw the consequences of disregarding my feelings on the matter and actually have been trying to change. They are still petty about things, which is why they\u2019re still at a distance. But honestly, holding people accountable works.", "He needs to be stepping up more in these situations and not being neutral especially when his family are purposefully being disrespectful to you.", "It'd be weird to love them for anything else really.", "Exactly! I know the feeling. We had our baby last year and we had to stay in the hospital because he was ill. And then we were home and I went: and now what? In my country you will get help for the first 8 days (can be extended in some cases). They make sure you know the basis (bathing, feeding) and they are there for some household work and to give mother some sleep and rest. But because I was in the hospital for all those days we only got like 4 hours and we had the most useless person ever. So in the end it caused me more stress and less sleep. Other people have had better experiences with their maternity assistant. So it can be a great help.", "That appears to be a universal feeling. Literally everyone I've talked to was like 'they're just letting us leave with a baby? Who does that?'", ">I\u2019m glad and very proud of my generation, who would rather pay for expensive baby sitter/day care/friend care/whatever care than have to subject ourselves to being disrespected in any way or form.\n\nThat's a very \"getting paid a living wage\" way of thinking.  \"Rather\" means a choice, which is what a lot of folks across the U.S. don't have.\n\nAnd hey, if it's just taking care of oneself, that's no problem.  But when you have a small child (or god forbid more than one) that needs to be fed, housed, the lights kept on, etc.  There's no affording childcare that eats over half of your paycheck while also trying to pay rent.  It's a fantasy to think otherwise, no matter how unpopular the opinion is.\n\n>Your thoughts belong in the 50\u2019s, we don\u2019t want nor need them thank you!\n\nIf this were the 50s, a family could afford the things they need with a single income.\n\n>You don\u2019t mind being mistreated so you can save a few bucks down the line is your choice, but don\u2019t you dare say our generating is wrong for not putting up bull\\*\\*\\*t from others ESPECIALLY from those who should be protective.\n\nThis is not \"saving a few bucks\" that I'm talking about.  If you have the option to break off from shitty family, it's not wrong to do so.  I'm not arguing for accepting toxicity in the name of family loyalty.  I'm advocating for using them for as long as you need to reach stability.\n\nImagine thinking single parents making $15/hr or less are wrong when they have to tough it out with a shitty relative because the only other choices they have are worse.  That's privilege.", "No, having principles and being loyal to them is not a privilege lmao, no matter how much or how little you earn. If you sell your principles to someone who was bad to you in exchange for babysitting, they\u2019re not principles, they\u2019re just wishes. I don\u2019t even need to reply to the rest cause if you can\u2019t grasp this you\u2019re clearly in the 50\u2019s. \n\nBtw, just so your head doesn\u2019t explode, when I commented about \u201cthe 50\u2019s\u201d I was not taking about \u201clife facility\u201d or how much you could do with 1$ then vs now (I forgot the word for this, English is not my primary language), it was about mentality then vs now\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f next time I\u2019ll draw.", "I have not changed my initial opinion."]}
