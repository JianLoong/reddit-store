However, things didn't exactly go as planned.\n\nMy boyfriend's family is pretty traditional, and they weren't too happy that we were having a baby out of wedlock. They've been pretty distant and cold towards me since the announcement, but I thought that maybe the baby shower would be a chance for us to bond and put our differences aside.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. From the moment I arrived, my boyfriend's aunt made snide comments about my age and how \"young mothers never know what they're doing.\" Then, his brother asked if I was planning on getting a job after the baby was born, implying that I was just going to mooch off my boyfriend for the rest of my life or something. \n\nThings really came to a head when my boyfriend's mom gave me a gift bag that was filled with baby clothes...in all pink. When I politely pointed out that we were having a boy, she rolled her eyes and said, \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nAt that point, I was done. I stood up and announced that I didn't feel welcome there and that I was leaving. My boyfriend tried to convince me to stay, but I was so upset that I just walked out. \n\nNow my boyfriend's family is calling me rude and ungrateful for storming out of my own baby shower, but I feel like they were the ones being disrespectful to me. I\u2019m especially hurt that my boyfriend\u2019s family thinks I can\u2019t even care for my own child.

Too bad you don't know the rule about being kind to the mother if you want to see the baby.\"", "NTA - OP, you didn't feel welcome because you weren't welcome.  Also - \n\n \"Oh, well, I just assumed that since you're so young, you probably don't know the sex of your own baby.\"\n\nThis is the strangest \"dig\" I've ever heard. Young moms not knowing the sex of their babies is...not a thing.", "NTA. The pink comment was ridiculous, and I don't understand why they are not equally disapproving of their son for having a child young and out of wedlock!", "The fact your boyfriend didn\u2019t tell his family to back down and stop treating you like shit is even worse than their behavior. You\u2019re NTA but your boyfriend\u2019s family is and I\u2019m even considering him one since he clearly didn\u2019t support you and stand up for you.", "NTA - while it might sound harsh, you need to have an immediate and serious conversation with your boyfriend about how he is going to handle the situation going forward. If he is not willing to immediately step up and advise his family to stop their crap and treat you with respect, then you would be very well advised to start preparing to be a single mother. Any person who would let their family treat their partner this way is not someone who will make a good parent. For your well-being and that of your child, this behavior needs to be corrected or they need to be removed from your life. You have no obligation to expose your child to their unkind treatment of you.", "NTA - Not sure what their problem is but that is not how you treat anyone, let alone family. If they have a problem they should talk to you directly instead of treating you like crap.", "NTA. They were rude, thoughtless and passive aggressive. You may very well be too young and have a lot to figure out but you also may be just fine. Either way you\u2019re having a baby. Congratulations! What they did wasn\u2019t ok and I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself. I think it\u2019s a sign of things to come. Set boundaries now. The pink clothing was especially spiteful. I\u2019m the type of person who would dress my son in those clothes (at least for pictures) just to get them back though. Don\u2019t let them get to you", "NTA. I think they are rude too.", "NTA but you need to make sure you draw up some pretty tight boundaries for after the birth. They don't get to disrespect you then play happy families.", "Why on earth would his mom waste money buying girl clothes if she knew you were having a boy? How did they honestly expect you to respond to all of their rude comments? These people are a bunch of weirdos and your boyfriend sucks for not defending you. NTA", "NTA. You need to have a serious boundary conversation with your boyfriend about his family. They do not like you & will try to meddle in your parenthood. There's a subreddit called justnomil that you'd benefit from checking out. A lot of times this is a make or break situation. If your boyfriend defends you had your back & keeps his family away from you, you're in good shape. If he agrees with them or defends them or asks that you sacrifice your sense of well-being for his family then you're in trouble & really should check out that subreddit! Best of luck congrats on the baby. Don't let people make you feel small because you're young. Being a mom at 19 isn't the end of the world. I hope his family is in for a rude awakening thinking they can treat you this way. It is your partners job to keep his family in line. I hope he is on your team. There's nothing worse than having a baby with someone who puts their family of origin ahead of you.", "Nta. I'm so sorry they are treating you this way. Just bc you are young doesn't mean you won't be a great mother! Sending you hugs,  you are in for a bumpy ride w his family I'm afraid.", "NTA but the way bigger problem than your bf's family is your boyfriend.

Absolutely.\n\nWere you completely justified in leaving early? Also, yes.\n\nWill this be the last time that someone makes a rude comment about you being a parent at your age? Unfortunately, not. \n\nYou're going to have get a little tougher about dealing with these comments. In two months or less, you are no longer you. You are 'we'. These people will be your babies family members, and a potential source of babysitting and support for you. You'll have to learn to set boundaries and not let stupid comments get you upset. \n\nYou have no obligation to satisfy their curiosity. \n\nSomeone hands you a giftbag, the response is 'thank you'. Then return, exchange, sell or donate; they don't need to know. \n\nThese people are not your friends or family, so reset your expectations. \n\nEverything is going to change rapidly in about two months. Rely on your own friends and family; anything from the bf's family is a nice bonus but not obligatory or reliable. \n\nYou set the boundaries for yourself and your baby.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend needs to man up and stand up to them.  I hope you will make it clear that his family are not welcome in your life due to their disrespect.", "NTA. I mean seriously what did your BF think was going to happen when his family was being so rude to you. I am sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nWhere do they have the audacity to call you rude when your so-called baby shower was just them shitting on you? Beliefs and circumstances aside, to go that far out of the way to make you feel bad is downright cruel.\n\nIMO you should set a hard boundary with your bf that you will be having minimal, if any, contact with his family. The same goes for your baby. Those people won't be a good influence and will undoubtedly cause issues in your life. Find a more supportive system for you and your baby. Hell, I'll crochet a baby blanket if you need it.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to sit there and endure passive aggressive comments or insults for anyone, in any situation. Just because they made the effort to come to your baby shower does not give them a free pass to be AH\u2019s. Sure you could politely ask them not to make comments but that could lead to more conflict, I think removing yourself from the situation was probably the best call.", "NTA. You did the right thing getting out of there but maybe have a talk with your boyfriend and try to work out boundaries and having him discuss it with them.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need to have people commenting, or implying anything negative.\n\nYou're young and will eventually learn how to handle the situation better; but for now, you're not in the wrong for removing yourself from that environment.\n\nThere was no mention of (or maybe I missed it), where you told your bf what was happening. If you said nothing to him, he can't defend you; or mitigate the situation by telling the family members to quit being rude & passive-aggressive to you. You definitely want to communicate that behavior to him, so he can either see their actions himself, or be in proximity to negate what they might tell you when he's not around.\n\nI hope he sees that, now; and you can move forward, together, as a team.", "NTA. I hope you and your husband (and son) have love and support from your family and friends and that his family wises up quickly. That wasn\u2019t a baby shower\u2014that was an excuse for them to act disrespectfully.", "NTA. I'm sorry they treated you this way.  I had my first son at 19. Don't let anyone make you think you can't do a great fucking job as a parent.  You can,  and you will.  My son is almost 17 now.  He's in jrotc as an airman second class.  He's enlisting next year with plans to be a medic in the army.  He's kind,  compassionate,  a great older brother. He's a good man,  and that's because I was a good mom. It's going to be hard.  It's going to be lonely. You ARE going to struggle like you never realized you could struggle.  But you CAN do this.  Ignore them and be the best damn mother anyone has ever seen.  You put your son first by putting yourself first starting now.  If your bf isn't going to be supportive and protect you from this,  make a plan and do it on your own.  I did,  you can.  Your whole life is going to change, but every single minute of struggle will be worth it.  I promise.", "NTA. It sucks that they were being mean. But I hope you do realize the enormity of your situation, and I hope your boyfriend is supportive. Raising a child is no joke, and you are very young. I wish you the best.", "I always had (and have) a sharp tongue, so everybody would have gotten answers in kind. But i also know not everybody is this way. They where mean to you, your bf should get a backbone and you're NTA.", "NTA but your BF is.", "NTA I\u2019m sure you\u2019re feeling very attacked and you were.  But these awful people will be your child\u2019s family so you will need to learn to deal with them until you decide to go no contact.  When dealing with rude people, my go to is to either straight faced respond with \u201cwhat an odd thing to say, could you explain what you mean by that\u201d.  People like this will then act as if you\u2019re the aggressor.  Just keep repeating that you\u2019d like the comment explained.  Just keep pretending that everything they say is as if they really care and respond in kind.  For instance, \u201cis it your experience or did you read about young moms not knowing the sex of their babies?  Next time just ask, I\u2019m happy to share with you.  Now that you know you\u2019re going to have a grandson do you want to return these or should I? Honey, mom bought kiddo lovely things but you should have told her we\u2019re having a boy!  \u201c \n\nIf you get mad at them, you lose.  Your boyfriend better step though, he needs to be your and baby\u2019s protector now.", "INFO: What was your boyfriend's reaction to the events at the baby shower?", "NTA", "NTA.  Also don't let comments about your age bother you. My daughter got preggers at 16, married at 17, and still as in love 14 years later as they were as teens. She is an amazing mother to 4 boys and you can do it too. Decide what kind of mother your baby deserves and then do your best to be that mother. You'll be fine!", "All those comments they made were extremely rude and offensive. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t let any of them near me or my baby if I were you. Forget them!!!! Best wishes to you and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA. I\u2019d be having a sit down with the boyfriend and going over respect, boundaries, and expectations. If he\u2019s not on your side, I am sure you\u2019ll do fine on your own. I hope that the family and friends on your side are kind and supportive, I wouldn\u2019t count on his side for anything.", "NTA. Does your baby dad have the power of speech? He needs to shut that shit down now. If he\u2019s ok with that behavior, you need to ask yourself if you want to be treated this way for at least 18 years.", "I'll give a (probably unpopular) ESH here.  Your bf's family were definitely TA for their comments and the way they treated you.  But they weren't wrong that you're way too young to have a baby.  \n\nBabies are expensive.  Like, really expensive.  Are you and your bf in a financial position to spend thousands of dollars a year on clothes, food, furniture, and everything else a baby needs?\n\nAnd they consume all of your time.  Is your boyfriend mature enough to give up a big chunk of his free time to help you with the baby?

These people deliberately upset a 7 months pregnant teenager, shitting on her specifically due to her age, & whatever hallucinations they have about her competency. \n\nExcellent you walked out. Bravo!\n\nIt could be that bc your boyfriend been around his relatives his whole life, he doesn't recognize abuse. A question to sit down & ask yourself is how long you are willing to educate him about proper response to this crap from his family. Unless he cuts them off, you're in a package deal now because of your child. Please do not let these people grind you down over time. They simply cannot be in your life if they don't reverse course. That needs spelled out by you both, & the sooner the better, because they're only gonna get worse. Good luck", "NTA, your boyfriend is going to be a father. He needs to grow a spine and tell his family to back off.", "You have a boyfriend problem", "NTA. I guess that Bf's family won't be involved in LO's life going forward.", "NTA\n\nYou have enough to worry about without their extra BS in your life.\n\nLast I checked, if you end up not knowing what the gender is, you pick colors that are entirely gender neutral.   Hell my sister insisted on gender neutral from the beginning because she wanted to be able to reuse all of my niece's stuff for my nephew.\n\nNot only did she insult you but she also tried to directly harm her own grandchild by going out of her way to waste money on things he wouldn't be able to make use of.\n\nIf they had any intention of actually trying to help you while continuing to be a low effort family, they could have just given you gift cards for the places that have diaper supplies.\n\nInstead they went hostile to both you and your child for no reason.", "I'm SO proud of you!\n\nI'm 43 and I don't have the guts to make my boundary known and to detach\n\nYou did not get stuck.\n\n\nYou did perfect!", "New name for his mom: the granny who doesn\u2019t see my baby. \nNTA.", "NTA. Sounds like an ambush to me,not a shower.", "NTA.\n\nYou are young, and society isn't great with young mums. There will be times when people are ridiculous. My advice is to say that's nice and continue doing what works for you and your child. \n\nNow your FMIL and her family are crap. She not only thinks you are incapable of knowing the gender of your own child, but she also is saying the ultrasound tech and any physicians that confirmed this gender to you are idiots. So point in fact, she's an idiot. You should also look up the Justnomil page. It will help give advice. Also, make sure you check your state law on grandparent rights. Your boyfriend needs to learn what a shiny spine is. \n\nGood luck with your baby.", "NTA. Don't tie yourself to this family. Do what you need to, to be able to take care of yourself.", "NTA - and let me just add that you have no obligation to put up with future trash behaviour from these folks just because they\u2019re related to your child.", "NTA", "NTA they're just upset you didn't stick around to let them keep abusing you.", "NTA - \u201cwe demand you sit here and take it while we insult you over and over.\u201d  Screw that.  You frankly should have walked out earlier.\n\nOne also wonders whether they\u2019re giving their Golden Boy the same sort of thrashing they\u2019ve dishing out on you. He is equally culpable, after all.", "NTA", "I feel bad the boyfriend didn\u2019t stand up for her & instead tried to get her to stay. I see a long sad life ahead if boyfriend can\u2019t stand up to his mother\u2019s rudeness. He\u2019s never going to have her back if he can\u2019t do it at 7 months pregnant.", "NTA", "NTA. \"I don't know what gave you the impression I allow people to insult me to my face without consequence, and it's sad your whole family seems to have not learned any manners. I'll make sure to teach baby *name* better.\"\n\nTell your BF that he better get his head on straight before the baby arrives, not immediately shutting his family down puts him on paper thin ice. Hold necessary boundaries, especially with him.", "NTA, obviously. Why didn't your bf stand up for you?", "Your not married, do not put him as the father of the baby. Youll both be parents and he will have rights to your child. If you dont want for him to be in your or your childs life, dont put him as the father. He clearly doesnt give a shit about you or he would have defended you at every turn. They never talked about how young and dumb he is.", "NTA\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a baby shower. \n\nThat was a pi\u00f1ata party and you were the pi\u00f1ata.", "Nta there the rude ones don't let them into your child life", "NTA.  Can this internet stranger say I\u2019m proud of you, OP?  There is no way I would have been as brave as you at your age.  I\u2019d have sat there, embarrassed and trying not to cry with a strained smile on my face, because I\u2019d been trained all my life to be polite and respectful.  It took me until I was 30 to stand up for myself.  Bravo!", "NTA. But man this has some really crazy abusive vibes from them.", "Nta how fucking rude", "Ex", "NTA. You sat through more bullcrap than I would have! Also, mothers of all ages don\u2019t know the sex until it\u2019s shown in the screener testing or an ultrasound scan. Age has nothing to do with it. Your BFs Mum sounds insufferable and rude. Set your boundaries early. She and the family act civilly towards you, or no access. Your SO needs to back you up, or the next 18 years are not gonna be fun. I\u2019m sorry your baby shower was bad.", "NTA. Let me give you some advice. Raise your child the best you can. Like you\u2019ve got something to prove, because you do. One day they will all be wrong to have under estimated you. Take solace in that. You can be successful and also be a young mother. I know. I\u2019ve done it.", "NTA, they were the rude ones.", "NTA. Good for you for walking out. I wish I had done the same at mine 9years ago. Guarentee you won't regret it in the future, always stand up for yourself and your kid. Hope your bf sees your side.", "NTA, make it clear to your boyfriend that you are being disrespected.", "Because it's always easier to blame others, not your immediate family.", "I'm petty enough that my son would wear pink to visit her for the rest of his existence. only pink, only for her.", "I would love to know the logic behind this. When are you old enough to know the sex of your baby? Do you have to be 25? 30? 40?\n\nMy kids are teenagers now, am I old enough to know what sex they are? If not, how much longer should I wait?", "It is the strangest dig. I interpreted it as she was implying that young mothers don't pay attention and disregard the advice/knowledge of others.", "THIS", "Its the type of thing where if it isn't sorted and they do stay together is IS going to cause massive, massive arguments down the line.", "This is why you don't take advice from strangers on the Internet. If someone's advice to a 19 year old soon to be mother is to start giving her 21 year old boyfriend ultimatums he probably can't deliver on, it's easy to see why the number of broken and unhappy families is trending higher and higher. \n\nThis girl is 19 years old. No education, no stability, nothing. And your FIRST piece of advice is to set her up for complete failure as a woman, a partner and a mother. People really need to be ashamed of themselves.", "I told my family the same thing if you disrespect my wife and she\u2019s doesn\u2019t want you to see our child I have her back 100%", "This. I had to shut my mother down HARD because of a somewhat similar situation and that's where the line is. Wanna see your grandbaby? Act like a human being. Cross that line? See you later.", "This is the best response! NTA. Your bf needs to tell his family to stop treating you this way.", "Actually that isn't the case. Dad's have rights too. Mommy doesn't run everything. In this case I'd keep the kid away but to even imply that mom's run the show is a joke.", "I don\u2019t believe in positing baby photos on social media, but if I did, I\u2019d have lots of fun making grandson pretty in pink and tag their traditional family members with enthused thanks to grandma for the outfits.", "Why in the world would anyone let people so clearly disrespectful to them watch their child? OP doesn't need to toughen up she did exactly the right thing, sitting there being disrespected and treated like a moron would not have made her tough it would have made her a doormat that these people would continually treat like trash. Best they find out now that she's not going to take it.", "What they said especially in Dr offices. \nMy oldest got pregnant at 15 and her child\u2019s doctors do not listen to her.", "Also, feel free to go no contact with the lot of them when it comes time to visit the little bundle of joy.  You can bet they will spend the whole time equally divided between cooing over the baby and insulting his mother, and neither of you need that in your life.", "Oh, no.  In this family, if the genders were reversed you *know* they'd be calling op a predator and a deadbeat, saddling their poor daughter with a child.  They'd be making remarks about his earning potential and parenting.\n\nStereotypically, it's the father that gets shit on far more by the mom's family.  Like it or not, most of the time, the brunt of parenthood falls on the single mother.  Dad's family usually plays nicer with young mom because they know she's got the heavier load going forward, and she's the gatekeeper to access their grandchild.", "I think it was probably a dig at society being able to change their genders, apparently just a young person thing (to Mil)", "You\u2019ll never get to know\u2026", "I second this THIS", "Am I allowed to love an internet stranger for a comment? I love you bro. This is the best answer. \ud83d\udcaf", "BF doesn't seem to have any problem with it.", "A single mom does in fact basically run the show. Dad will probably have visitation rights, as well as other stuff as assigned by the court after having his child support set.", "This is the way.", "staying neutral is not supporting you at all", "Yikes! If he\u2019s not able to support and defend you over his family, this is going to be hell for you. I made that mistake and paid for it for years. I would cut his family out. Even if it\u2019s temporarily, I would give yourself a break. You have no obligation to his family and they are not entitled to see you. Just stop interacting with them at all. You and your boyfriend have some relationship issues to work through as he doesn\u2019t defend, support or stick up for you- and that\u2019s his job. Couples counseling might be a good idea? \n\nNTA- they were extremely disrespectful and awful to you. Cut them out of your life and leave them out. Unfortunately, your boyfriend will have to make his own decisions, and I\u2019m sorry to say, I don\u2019t expect him to make a good choice for you. It seems he has a dysfunctional family and he does know how/will not hold them accountable. I wish you and your baby the best", "Ma\u2019am go read some of the JUSTNOMIL  and JUSTNOSO horror stories to see your future good luck and congratulations on the baby", "I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting these people watch her child.\n\nBut it\u2019s very smart to reset expectations and have a \u201cthicker skin\u201d when it comes to this sort of criticism. Moms of all ages can get criticized by rude in-laws, and even rude strangers. OP is really young, so she\u2019s gonna get a lot of flack from all kinds of people. \n\nThe best thing OP can do is believe in herself, have confidence that\u2019s she\u2019s doing her best, and say a silent \u201cfuck you\u201d to all the naysayers. Otherwise she\u2019s going to spend years needlessly defending her parenting to a bunch of AHs who don\u2019t matter.", "I'm so sorry.\n\nShe was a still a child when her childhood ended. \n\nHer child deserves responsible adults. I hope your daughter has the support she needs to give her the time to become a responsible adult while still being a parent. \n\nIt's so complicated when children have children. It's a bigger responsibility for her parents and close family members. You essentially had to raise a daughter and a grandchild at the same time. It's a tough situation.", "I thirds this THIS", "He should.", "But OP isn't a single mom.", "\"These people will be your babies family members, and a potential source of babysitting and support for you.\"", "My bad! Thanks for pointing that out."]}
