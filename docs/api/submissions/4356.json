She has a daughter who I'll call Lucy.\n\nMy husband and I were at Mary's house drinking. At 9:30pm Lucy and her baby come over. Since we were staying over my husband and I were playing a drinking game with Mary. Lucy does a shot and cracks open a beer before taking the baby out of her carseat. I asked Lucy when the baby's bedtime was and she said \"I like to be up at night so I just keep her up with me. We get up at 6pm and stay up til about 5 am. She's a little night owl!\" At this point I notice Lucy's front right tooth is blue. For anyone who doesn't know blue teeth is a big tip off that someone uses meth. I also noticed she has sores covered in makeup. Not acne, sores, which is another tip off someone's using meth. I'm a recovered addict so I've seen it a lot. \n\nAfter drinking more Lucy says \"who wants a tattoo?\" Mary volunteers. While tattooing, Lucy keeps drinking. She'd do one small line of the tattoo and do another shot or chug a beer. At this point the baby is screaming, sticking her fingers in the ink wells and trying to lick her fingers (the ink wells are contaminated by Mary's blood at this point). Lucy is completely wasted and starts tattooing other people with the same needle and ink. I had stopped drinking and was taking care of the baby. I asked Lucy when she ate she said \"we eat breakfast at 8pm but we didn't have time today\".I gave the baby a bunch of snacks and when she started falling asleep Lucy told me to wake her up, \"her bedtime isn't until 5\".\n\nAround 3:30 Lucy says she's going home and everyone tries to get her to stay, even hiding her keys and threatening to call the cops.  I offered to watch the baby but she was adamant about taking her. We had been stalling her for over an hour, she said it was baby's bedtime and she had to go. I insisted on getting baby in the car so I could make sure she was in there safely since Lucy was going to leave with the baby regardless. When she pulled off my husband went outside and called the cops and reported her for driving drunk (which he's never done before) but he forgot to mention she had a baby. The cops just said they'd \"keep an eye out\". When we got in Mary was making tons of excuses for Lucy's behavior. I asked her what kind of support Lucy has at home, apparently baby's dad signed over parenting rights and wants nothing to do with her. I stupidly asked what would happen if someone called CPS and she said \"I don't know but I'm not taking her\". \n\nSince I made that comment, I'm sure that they'll know it's me that called CPS if I call. Also the baby clearly doesn't have many people in her life, so she'd most likely go to foster care if she was removed from the home. \n\nTLDR; a woman was showing signs of being on drugs, keeps her baby awake from 6pm to 4am and drove drunk with her child\n\nWIBTA if I called CPS?

The mother is clearly unfit to parent at this point in her life (not saying she'll never be fit, just that she's obviously facing her own demons right now that she needs help for), and giving that child at least a SHOT at a fighting chance outside of the home is worth the call. \n\nI realize that foster systems in most US states are crap, but to me the likelihood of a tragic situation unfolding in the child's current home based on the scenario you laid out is about 100%.", "YWNBTA.

'I gave her a bunch of snacks' means that this poor child isn't getting proper nutrition, that can lead to all sorts of physical and mental delays if not permanent damage.  \n\nIf she just had skin issues, and was out late with the baby - No, none of your business. But you saw this young woman drinking heavily, waking up the baby, describing unhealthy feeding & sleeping times. Not showing concern for her babies health or safety. As well as acting sketchy AF.  You have to know that THIS wasn't the only time she's driven drunk with that child in the car, YOU put the baby safely into the car seat - if 'mom' is drunk that's another accident waiting to happen.", "Call cps.

CONGRATS on that alone! It is an amazing accomplishment to stop using, and I applaud you for it. I don't want to overstep here, but just want to point out that this whole situation and the stressors involved for you could be very triggering, so please be careful to take care of yourself above all else.

This child is in danger if she\u2019s drinking and driving/doing drugs. The schedule itself is not sustainable for a baby. I\u2019m not sure how comfortable you are with her to possibly talk with her about her behavior and if things don\u2019t change you\u2019ll be forced to call CPS for the safety of her child. She needs a serious reality check and help. Being a single mom is hard but she really needs to grow up and take responsibility of her child.

She\u2019s neglecting and endangering her child unfortunately and if things don\u2019t change now, they never will and will only get worse", "NTA.

Even if there's not meth involved which I think clearly there is everything about her treatment of this baby is not okay. Please do the right thing and report her.", "NTA. Call CPS immediately. You're going to have to live with the guilt if something happens to that baby. I know I would rather feel the guilt for calling than the guilt for not calling if that baby gets hurt or worse.", "NTA\n\n* You should not have remarked anything about CPS to your friend, you may lose this friendship now if you call, because people don't take too kindly to having CPS in their life.\n* If you're in the USA you could have called the 1-800 GRAB DUI # when she left and reported her license plate.  Then the police would have gotten CPS involved if they found her driving drunk with a child in the car\n* A person can have sores on their face without doing meth.  \n* Advice varies on when kids should go to bed.  It's more recommended that they get a certain amount of hours of sleep per day, but it's not necessary for them to always be at night.\n* You might have to give up this friendship.  It says a lot that your friend hasn't already called about the situation.  Did she offer any reason as to why she hasn't?  Does she have a halfway decent reason for staying out of it? \n* I'm always hesitant to call CPS because I was in the system as a kid for a parent who drank too much and did drugs.  I experienced worse abuse in foster care than the neglect I experienced in my biological mother's care, so CPS doesn't always make things better.  But my own experience has colored my opinion of the system but it's always something to keep in mind.  \n* She shouldn't have driven drunk at all, let alone with a child in the car.  If she makes decisions like this regularly, CPS will likely end up involved at some point whether or not you make the call.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
