My father's parents (aka my **wealthy** grandparents,) have been the most problematic people in my family. Back when my younger sister's 1st birthday came around, my grandparents and parents had a falling out due to my middle-age aunt who has **mental illness**. For context, she lives with my grandparents currently. She told my grandparents untrue things, and in turn they called my mom slurs, saying that she'd never be good enough for my father. Being really young at the time, I never understood why they stopped talking until a year ago my mother told me everything. After 5 years of not talking, my great grandmother died in 2018 and my grandparents invited us to the funeral to incorporate themselves back in our lives, claiming that they changed. \n\nFast forward to today, we've visited their home for different occasions (birthdays, holidays, etc), however I've grown resentful towards them as they have not changed at all whatsoever, remaining self-centered and materialistic. My aunt still lives with my grandparents and **refuses** to seek treatment for her illness although my dad begs them to, mind you she is unemployed and uses daddy's money. Not only that, whenever they visit for one of our birthdays they always seem to make it about themselves. On my father's birthday, he waited all day to get a call from them, and you know what they did? They called him at 6:00 PM on his birthday, telling him about what a hard day they had, no regard that it was his birthday. The worst part is that my father won't cut them off because he loves them, yet he refuses to hug his sister (my aunt) at all. He just leaves it up to my mom to converse with my grandparents although we're practically **estranged**. She even cried in front of me, saying that she hates seeing them and having to put a fake persona on display to please them, mind you they believe the world revolves around them. \n\nAfter seeing my mom cry, I lost it and told my dad that I hate my grandparents and aunt, adding that I don't want to see them anymore. My dad started **yelling** at me, telling me I shouldn't be disrespectful as they gave me generous amounts of money on my birthday (which I find to be really irrelevant.) My mom agrees with me because they never really did change, becoming more of a nuisance in our lives as my aunt spam texts my mom and dad about her delusions after being told to stop. When brought up to my grandparents, they just don't seem to care that she's bothering us constantly, saying how their life is soo hard compared to ours (they sleep in until 11am). My grandparents are **unwilling** to compromise and my dad isn't hearing me out although my grandparents and I are practically estranged. I feel bad for hurting my dad by telling him this, however he refuses to be close with them either (i.e. no hugging), so **AITA**?\n\np.s. this is a throwaway acc ", "created_utc": 1689526635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151b9en/aita_for_telling_my_father_that_i_hate_his_side/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA. My grandparents live a 20 minute train ride and I only see them when my mom is in town to make her feel good. I do not need them in my life. They are rude, unpleasant, manipulative, antisemitic, homophobic, and sometimes directly offensive to me. Blood relation does not mean you have to see them.\n\nThat being said, you are 16. As long as your parents are not forcing you to help them or visit them on your own, and as long as they are not abusing you, I would just see them to keep the peace in your family. \n\nBasically, I would let them know how you feel and tell them that once you are an adult, you won't be making an effort with those toxic people. Until then, you are willing to do the minimum prevent further drama and conflict. But at the same time, you will not stand for any abusive behavior. You have the right to set boundaries. You can leave or call them out if they are being offensive. \n\nYou can also choose the boundary of no contact if it truly is unbearable. \n\nBut remind your dad that every time he forces you and your mom to endure them, he is harming the people who care about him most, know him best, and love him best. That disregard for you two may slowly erode the good relationships he has.\n\nThe best way to deal with the selfish actions of parents is to: \n\n1. Remember teenage life is temporary \n\n2. Shock them with maturity and thoughtfulness. Being reminded that you are a thoughtful, caring, and empathetic person goes a long way. \n\n3. Showing up does not mean you have to be fully engaged with people who suck. I used to say \"ill be right back\" and just wander around outside or take a longggg walk.", "Nta.
