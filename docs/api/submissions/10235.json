If it's something that is not a problem and the child is likely to grow out of naturally, many speech therapists will decline to work with the child until the window for the child to grow out of the issue is starting to close.  Allowing a child to grow out of something naturally is the best option in most cases.  Theodore Roosevelt had this exact same issue, and he grew up to be a great speaker.\n\nI was a fast talker.  My parents put me in activities like speech competitions/debate where enunciation and diction were a natural part of the activity.  This provided me with an intellectual challenge I enjoyed AND taught me how to control the speed of my speech without being self-conscious about it.   Oh, and I became skilled at public speaking.  Now my communication skills, especially my ability and willingness to give presentations, are routinely praised in my career.  Lots of activities like performing arts, voice training, etc. will include that skill as well.  Your kid is smart.

If you're in the US schools only provide free services if the child meets a criteria of delay or impediment that is well below normal (think 30% behind their cohort) and if the delay is making it harder for the child to learn. Not meeting the criteria for free school-based services does not mean that your child would not benefit greatly from receiving an intervention. Your pediatrician can review the evaluation and advise on the best course of action.\n\nBest of luck. And, depending on a secondary evaluation, you might find it covered by insurance anyway.", "hmmm. Tough one. On the one hand,  good for you  for not rushing to spend the money. I would politely suggest that you should get a second and probably a third opinion. That might put your wife's mind at ease and diffuse the tension between you two. On the other hand, I don't think your wife's in the wrong either. Talking too fast might actually affect how others think and feel about communicating with your child once she is older.

Those are the things a speech-language pathologist treats. Talking overly fast, without other speech production errors, will probably not be qualifying for speech therapy and wouldn't be something that most speech-language pathologists will take on for therapy.

If even the teachers don\u2019t have an issue with it, I think this might just be your wife\u2019s problem to get over. \n\nI ask about location because when I was a preteen, I moved from a city with a fast speech pattern to a more slowed down region and got a lot of comments about how I fast I talked, how I came off as \u201caggressive\u201d, etc. It was just a regional difference, not a pathology.", "Does she also consume books at a rapid rate of knots?\n\nI'm a fast talker, although I've generally learned to tone it down over the years. I'm also a fast reader, even moreso when I was a kid. I was so used to reading fast that the words would try to come out of my mouth at a speed to match.\n\nAs I said, I have learned to tone it down. Sometimes I still get carried away when I get excited or passionate about something. But it's never hindered me in anything I've done in life, and I'm now in my mid-30s.", "It may not be a problem. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t hinder your kiddo later on. \n\nMy fast talking wasn\u2019t an issue until it was as a teen and I realized I sounded garbled when excited. \n\nWas diagnosed with ADHD way too late. It\u2019s often missed in girls. \n\nI didn\u2019t *need* speech therapy. I would have benefitted from it.", "Because in life it's an asset not a liability. As a known fast talker, she can learn techniques as she gets older, but talking fast and being smart is not sometime to be fixed.", "That would depend on how many people find that Riley \"speaks faster than others care to listen.\"\n\nIt CAN be an actual problem, but society will have a way of applying the brakes.", "We should also consider the possibility that mom does have her best interests at heart. \n\nHere, most people wait for their kids\u2019 school to specify that speech therapy is needed and then they\u2019re set up wjth a free service. \n\nBut your kid has to *really* need it. \n\nOur son, he wasn\u2019t clear. Clear enough that he didn\u2019t qualify for free therapy but enough that I and others noticed. Lateral lisp. We were told it wasn\u2019t a problem. Sure but he still benefitted from the therapy. \n\nI\u2019m glad we paid for therapy because the older he got the more it would have been apparent that he was not as clear as his peers. \n\nIt didn\u2019t have any academic impact but it certainly may have had a social impact and I didn\u2019t feel it was fair to saddle him with that. \n\nJust because the school won\u2019t cover it doesn\u2019t mean the child wouldn\u2019t benefit", "The whole world talks to slow. \n(Says the 'graduate' of speech therapy, currently listening to books and podcasts at 2.15x normal speed)", "Who trusts the public school to be the ultimate authority on this kind of stuff? \n\nAt the very least, they should have their child evaluated by someone recommended by her pediatrician.", "Op HASN'T asked a speech therapist he's going off what the SCHOOL says....", "Similar situation, school said I would probably grow out of it and never did. Professionals I\u2019ve talked about it with as an adult said that my mom should have absolutely gotten a second opinion from someone not associated with the school.", "Great idea!", "I was going to suggest some kind of debate team (for me it was Model UN) or even junior Toastmasters.", "NTA and this is great advice and it worked wonders for me and my speech speed as a kid. I had the same issue as a kid.", "OMG, when I moved to SC from MO, I had a friend who would interrupt me to say, \"OK, stop, breathe, and remember you're in the South!\", because I just spoke too quickly for him. \ud83e\udd23 Ah, good times...", "I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with ADHD until age 23\u2026and I\u2019m now medicated\u2026but I still talk fast (and loud if I\u2019m excited or angry). I just tend to hang around people who aren\u2019t bothered by it.", "That\u2019s a fair point. The tone from the OP gave me the impression that mom was really on an island here and more concerned about herself than the daughter. But of course we are only getting OP\u2019s view and mom\u2019s story might sound different (or I could be just introducing my own spin because we\u2019re all ultimately biased). \n\nGood call to consider other possibilities.", "Well when I slow more because I start stumbling over my words and need to get my brain caught up. Hahaha", "I've actually noticed that a lot of people seem to talk too fast, mumble or whisper even when asked to repeat themselves. I want to say \"Slow down and SPEAK UP\"", "Unlikely that the pediatrician will send Riley to a speech-language pathologist. SLPs diagnose and treat speech sound articulation) and sequencing (motor speech) disorders, fluency disorders, voice disorders and a variety of other language and communication disorders, but they don't treat people who simply talk fast because that isn't a disorder. And school speech-language pathologists are very, very capable of diagnosing communication disorders, especially those that will affect educational success, and they also know when a child will and will not qualify for school-based services. And a child who merely talks too fast most assuredly will NOT qualify for school-based speech services, or probably private speech services.", "You didn't answer chill_stoners question.", "Is a speech therapist working at a school automatically inferior?", "Got it. So it seems like the best course of action for OP is to get a second opinion?", "I come from Philly. Between the speed and the accent, it's amazing folks in Texas even recognize it as English.", "Yeah but if I\u2019m at work, I have to express myself articulately and clearly especially over camera.", "I wasn't diagnosed until 45 and have always been a crazy fast talker. Nobody put two and two together.", "It's my students who have really clued me into how fast I talk. They've actually asked me to slow down when I do read-alouds or ask \"why are you reading so fast?\" They will let me know if they didn't understand me because I was going too fast. And when I did a long term subbing gig in kindergarten I had to be extra cognizant of my vocal speed because if I sped up, they tended to get wound up!", "Yeah, saying it \u201cmakes her crazy\u201d makes it sound like mom is *annoyed* but she may just be worried; she accuses OP of not considering their kiddo. And like me with my son, knowing he would benefit from help but being surrounded by people saying he didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it was frustrating. I wanted to help so that it wouldn\u2019t become an issue", "I think people talk too slow. Like get to the point quickly. Mumble and whisper too.", "I think it could cause a conflict of interest. Many times, public schools have very limited resources and determining how those resources are allotted is oftentimes extremely political.  \n\nI would absolutely recommend that OP talk to their child\u2019s pediatrician and get a second opinion from someone not affiliated with the school.", "That was edited in.... Originally the \"school\" had an opinion....", "Weirdly enough, I have a friend in PA \u2014 lived there all his life \u2014 who often tells me I talk too fast. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in some variant of the South \u2014 mostly Texas \u2014 with a slightly slower typical speech pattern, ever since I was 7.\n\nAm I living in bizarro world?!", "I\u2019m a teacher, so I definitely have to slow down for work.", "But does the school have to offer free speech therapy to everyone with a problem or can they also just suggest it but not provide it based on parents income or availabe slots?", "The school (assuming its a US public school) legally has to offer free speech services to anyone who has a disability in the area of communication that impacts their ability to access the curriculum or be successful academically."]}
