If it's something that is not a problem and the child is likely to grow out of naturally, many speech therapists will decline to work with the child until the window for the child to grow out of the issue is starting to close.  Allowing a child to grow out of something naturally is the best option in most cases.  Theodore Roosevelt had this exact same issue, and he grew up to be a great speaker.\n\nI was a fast talker.  My parents put me in activities like speech competitions/debate where enunciation and diction were a natural part of the activity.  This provided me with an intellectual challenge I enjoyed AND taught me how to control the speed of my speech without being self-conscious about it.   Oh, and I became skilled at public speaking.  Now my communication skills, especially my ability and willingness to give presentations, are routinely praised in my career.  Lots of activities like performing arts, voice training, etc. will include that skill as well.  Your kid is smart.

If you're in the US schools only provide free services if the child meets a criteria of delay or impediment that is well below normal (think 30% behind their cohort) and if the delay is making it harder for the child to learn. Not meeting the criteria for free school-based services does not mean that your child would not benefit greatly from receiving an intervention. Your pediatrician can review the evaluation and advise on the best course of action.\n\nBest of luck. And, depending on a secondary evaluation, you might find it covered by insurance anyway.", "hmmm. Tough one. On the one hand,  good for you  for not rushing to spend the money. I would politely suggest that you should get a second and probably a third opinion. That might put your wife's mind at ease and diffuse the tension between you two. On the other hand, I don't think your wife's in the wrong either. Talking too fast might actually affect how others think and feel about communicating with your child once she is older.

Those are the things a speech-language pathologist treats. Talking overly fast, without other speech production errors, will probably not be qualifying for speech therapy and wouldn't be something that most speech-language pathologists will take on for therapy.

Sometimes they go into irrelevant details like a story about someone they want to tell you how they met or something. Just ask \"is this relevant\"", "Ask your wife why she doesn\u2019t like Riley. She\u2019s trying to change her for.. what? She\u2019s a kid and she talks a little fast. \nNta. Your wife though, major asshole.", "NTA. This is not a speech therapy issue at all imo. Kids go to speech therapy for delays or physical/neurological impediments (I had to see one for a bit as a kid because I was born with a bad tongue tie but it wasn\u2019t taken care of until I had developed a heavy lisp). A speech class would maybe benefit Riley just to teach her pacing but imo there\u2019s nothing wrong with her it\u2019s just as the first therapist has already said, her brain is just a little faster than her mouth at the moment", "Yup as a fellow adhder who counsels fellow neurodivergents, the rate, cadence, and delivery of speech is different than a NT if we are not bothering to mask.", "Came here to say this! And if she has ADHD, mom\u2019s gonna need to adjust her attitude REAL fast or this will be painful for everyone.", "The exact comment I was going to make. It was always my most obvious symptom.", "How does she treat your daughter? Is she constantly being disapproving of her and rejecting who she is to her face? This could cause serious emotional damage, so is pretty important.", "Not for me , i was bullied something terrible. voice acting did. Where I recorded scripts then played it back listening to how I sounded.", "People who talk slowly are maddening (and the ability to play audiobooks at faster speeds is a godsend - at normal speed they\u2019re so much slower than the speed I read at that it\u2019s unendurable).\n\nI actually sound a lot more stilted when I try to talk slowly and/or at a socially acceptable volume, because it\u2019s unnatural and too much of my attention is taken up by mentally monitoring the volume/speed I\u2019m speaking at, without enough left over for the actual words themselves. (Ditto trying to make sure I\u2019m not talking \u201ctoo much\u201d or monologging/dominating the conversation - I never realized how much mental energy that uses up and how exhausting it is until I was a participant in a panel discussion where it was the moderator\u2019s job to decide who spoke and for how long, and being able to just talk freely because it was officially my turn to speak and not anyone else\u2019s, without any worry about talking \u201ctoo much\u201d because deciding who got to talk and how often was someone else\u2019s job, was amazing.)", "Depends on which part of PA. The greater Philadelphia area speaks very quickly. Go west and it slows down.", "NTA. What's the point of catering to your wife's feelings if she's delusional?", "My name is Riley and I did the same thing at that age lol. I grew out of it. She will be fine. NTA. ESPECIALLY if professionals are already telling you it\u2019s not necessary", "My sister talks extremely fast. We got used to her speaking over the years. Other family members just remind her to talk slower and/or repeat what she has said. She's 20 and never had any one bring it up as a *problem*. NTA", "NTA. I was in speech therapy until I was 14. The trauma from that still haunts me, despite needing it 100%.", "NTA I have ADHD and I speak super fast , and people occasionally have trouble understanding me . But most people like my mom or friends are used to it and it does not create any problem  , i do get asked to speak slowly sometimes though. Also it\u2019s not going to be a huge problem at all , I regularly take part in debates and competitions involving public speaking at school . But also you should def talk to a therapist if your daughter is comfortable with it .", "NTA but I want to ask: What makes your wife think any reputable speech therapist will take on your kid?", "I was a Riley, and joining speech and debate made a huge difference. Now I only \u2018speed up\u2019 when I\u2019m really nervous, and I know to slow myself down.", "Legit question - what can be done/help adults that spent age 3-14 in  speech therapy keep up their skills? I've noticed I've slipped over the years and people are having a hard time understanding me.", "Was thinking this to but as a guy. Have ADHD and ADD and I talked like sonic as a kid. To a degree I still talk that fast sometimes, but I learned to take more pauses when I do.", "Joining a choir can do some of this, too.", "Yes!  My brain is constantly going.  Meds actually slow it down some so I can concentrate and get things done.  My brain moves faster than I can get words out quite often, lol.", "NTA. I spoke/speak very quickly, and it's because I have autism. My parents forced me to 'slow down,' and when i couldn't, they told me to not speak, period. Your child just sounds as was said: they're trying to keep up with their brain. I used to journal, and it's helped me to slow down when giving speeches at school at university. Absolutely NTA for not agreeing to the speech therapy. In fact, that may even push her to think that something is wrong with her.", "From someone who has constantly be told I talk waaay to fast but also struggles to slow down because my brain moves so much faster than my mouth.. NTA. I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s now and I have naturally slowed down as I\u2019ve aged, I do however still talk faster than most people but it\u2019s not so much an issue anymore. It\u2019s not something that requires speech therapy unless your daughter herself says she wants/ needs help with it down the line.", "Does she have any other signs of ADHD?", "NTA  - move to New Zealand we have to slow down when we visit the usa. She will fit right in.", "Nta. Riley might benefit from an adhd evaluation. If she has it, therapy(not speach) would help her slow down and get all those important words out .\n\nSource : my grandkid.", "This isn\u2019t something a speech therapist even handles. NTA.", "NTA. My mother was put off by my fast talking as well. I think it\u2019s ingrained in women from some older generations, depending on where they\u2019re from, that girls speaking quickly is an unladylike/unattractive quality.", "NTA but please be careful that your wife doesn't give your daughter a complex about the way she speaks. You need to get reinforcement from the school speech therapist that this is normal and there is nothing wrong with your daughter.", "NTA. I wonder if taking classes on public speaking would help make it more tolerable for the wife? Or learning a new language? There has to be ways to deal with this that will make daughters life better especially if the school believes it\u2019s because she\u2019s smart. Otherwise I fear this will ruin her relationship with her mom due to mom thinking that something\u2019s wrong with her and taking resources from someone who actually needs them is way to extreme. I feel that there has to be a middle ground to where it actually benefits the daughter. She\u2019s especially at the age where learning a new language would be easier now than later and would be so beneficial for anyone.", "NTA nothing wrong with her speech, she is just bright and passionate. Go for singing and drama lessons, speech and drama, acting, whatever it is called in your local area. They will ask her to slow down and speak clearly whilst engaging her in activities that will stimulate her mind and help her grow in confidence and creativity.", "NTA and considering no one BUT your wife has issues with how your daughter speaks make your wife an incredibly large AH. If anything, I would sit down with the wife and ask her what it is about how her daughter speaks makes her believe that she NEEDS speech therapy when everyone you have spoken to about this disagrees? Ask your wife why she is the ONLY one that has an issue.", "My dad once was so frustrated by my feverishly paced rambling that he told me he would have me looked at for having a pressured speech problem, so I taught myself (and practiced alone) to speak more slowly to avoid that. \n\nAdding this to the ever growing list of overlap I see between my behavior and how adhd presents in women", "Just a quick heads up - the fast talking can be a sign of low visibility female autism, in which case speech therapy can be a double edged sword. If her teachers are saying it isn't a problem, your wife needs to consider that altering the way Riley naturally communicates can be risky.", "Yes - acting, debate, forensics... try to get her involved in whatever is available at her school.  \n\n\nPlus, theater is fun.", "Heck my mom just had me practice by reading poetry and Shakespeare aloud. I'd sit and read to the dog and practice the rhythm and slowing down so I didn't stumble over my words or go too fast. Free, the kid learns something, and reading to a pet is a good non-judgemental audience bc the pet isn't gonna criticize and will enjoy the attention (especially if you're petting them while you read aloud). It worked well for me as a kid.", "The answer is very much dependent on what your speech or language issue is. That said, just like keeping up any other skill, conscious effort and practice is important. \n\nIf reviewing and practicing the strategies you were previously taught on your own doesn\u2019t help, I would suggest one or two sessions with an SLP to review strategies. \n\nYou can often find very low cost speech services at SLP teaching clinics. Look up your local university with an SLP program. You\u2019ll be treated by grad students but always supervised by a professional. It\u2019s much cheaper than private practices and you\u2019ll be getting the most up to date, evidence based treatments because university programs are where most of the new research is being done.", "I'm not from Cali, but I am from the Canadian West coast. I honestly didn't even realize how quickly I talked until I had friends be like \"WHAT\" constantly - especially since I have a couple friends from Brazil. They're both fluent but apparently I really fuck them up sometimes cause I can talk more quickly than they can process. It's the only reason I was even able to get better at making an effort to slow down, because I knew how rough it was on them."]}
