I would then go let the parents know that the girls cannot come over due to unsafe behavior and you will be implementing behavior changes for your own son.

And then if the mom and grandma come over to complain, you can explain have that conversation.", "NTA. I think that a frank conversation with the adults in the other household about the children's behavior is a kindness not many people would show. Some people have blinders about their kids behavior and some kids have just never been parented or faced repercussions of their actions .\n\nYou could say something like \" I love that my kids have playmates but I am noticing some behaviors we do not tolerate in my family like rough housing with my baby, touching my animals, and talking to my wife with an attitude. If you are still wanting your kids to play with my kids I need you to speak to them about these behaviors and allow me and my wife to remind them about the rules when they are over. Unfortunately if these behaviors continue we will no longer feel safe having them over and ask that you stop sending them without supervision.\"", "NTA. Talking to your neighbors is a good idea.  Please DO NOT use the approach you described in your post.  That is sure to make everyone angry.\n\nInstead, you could approach it as, \"Hey, we have certain rules in our house re: the small children, the tanks, how we talk to and treat each other.\"  Try to gently say when their kids are at your house you are going to ask them to follow your rules, such as don't pick up the 2 yo.  Then try it the next time the kids come over.  Start with 1-2 rules at a time. If they won't follow the 1-2 rules, then send them home.\n\nKids are smart.  They can follow different rules in different settings. Also, no one has taught them to behave better. This is your opportunity to do so. You might be pleasantly surprised by improved behavior.\n\nIf you approach the neighbors starting with \"your kids misbehave, they do x, y, z, and if they keep it up they can't come over anymore.\"  That is going to start a massive argument.

Simply state, \u201cWe have not invited your children over because they failed to follow our house rules. Maybe in a month or so we can discuss restarting play dates but only with you also supervising.\u201d  Also explain to your son that they are no longer coming over because they behave disrespectfully & children who behave disrespectfully are often asked to leave or not invited to playdates or birthday parties.", "Info. Why is the 9 year old coming over. There is a huge difference in ages.", "I have an 8 year old daughter and she always wants to play with her but she always just bails out and either comes and hangs out with me or my wife.", "Your house has a door, just don\u2019t open it.

Talk to your insurance, you may not be covered unless the trampoline is gated, even if the children are trespassing.", "You need a privacy fence with locked gates.", "There's an actual legal doctrine called \"attractive nuisances.\" Basically, if you have something on your property that is both hazardous and appealing to children, you have a duty to secure it or otherwise make it inaccessible, or else you can be held liable if a child comes on to your property and gets hurt. A trampoline is a good example, also an unsecured and unfenced swimming pool.\n\nThe point is that OP needs to secure the trampoline or her homeowners insurance will go up when one of the neighbor darlings falls and breaks their leg (if insurance even covers it at all -- it would not be unusual for a trampoline to be excluded).", "I understand that it\u2019s a legal issue.
