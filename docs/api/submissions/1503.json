My parents were never good with my Birthday. I was the black sheep of the family and my little brother who was the golden Childs birthday is less than a week away from mine so he usually got the attention. I haven\u2019t had a birthday present in years since I was a child. So because of this I never want people to feel the way I did on my birthday on theirs.\n\nMy best friend we will call Peter knows this. His birthday was a month ago. He told me wanted to go out for his birthday so we went to dinner and the bar after. I paid for everything and got him a PlayStation video game so spent about a $100 for his birthday since that\u2019s what he asked for. \n\nNow I didn\u2019t expect the same thing from him but I wanted to still celebrate since I haven\u2019t really had the chance. Well I\u2019m a performer so I had a show on my birthday. We made a plan for him to come to the show than we would get ice cream after. Well come the day of my birthday he didn\u2019t text me so I was a little sad but went to work and he wasn\u2019t in the audience. I texted him at Intermission and he said he forgot. He made it for the last 5 minutes. I was hurt by I was willing to move on. I asked about getting ice cream and he said he had plans to pick his boyfriend up from work so he couldn\u2019t. \n\nI was devastated. So I went to Walmart and bought myself a hoodie for my birthday present since I figured I deserved one this year.  Well today we were on the phone and I had mentioned that Christmas time is a busy time for work and this is how the interaction went \n\nPeter: so what are you going to get me for Christmas?\nMe: oh I thought we were doing presents this year \n\nHe was upset and I explained how hurt I was by how he treated me on my birthday. He than called me materialistic that my love language is gift giving. I was more hurt because he could have bought me a 10 cent candy or even picked up a rock on the ground and I would have loved it. So am I the asshole for saying that and not wanting to get him a Christmas present now?", "created_utc": 1667630289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymmdi4/aita_for_not_getting_my_best_friend_a_christmas/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn\u2019t sound like he respects or values your friendship. True friends remember birthdays, even if just to text/call. It sounds like he\u2019s really only interested in what he can gain from you. Does he make solid plans to hang with you when he\u2019s not getting anything? Or is it when he doesn\u2019t have anything else to do? \n\nAlso, birthdays are DEFINITELY a gift holiday. It\u2019s ridiculous that he\u2019s acting hurt based on the logic that Christmas gifts are expected.", "NTA, OP. He can't expect you to treat him on his birthday and make time for him if he isn't going to do the same for you. You explained the issue and he refused to acknowledge it. Plus, the materialistic comment about you is ironic since he asked what he was getting just before...", "NTA\n\nSounds like this had become kind of a tradition for you guys. He's being quite selfish for asking about gifts and not even being able to show up for a full night.", "I'm reading between the lines here, but it sounds like him not being there for you on your birthday was the bigger deal, rather than him not getting you a gift.\n\nIf so, it's probably worth expressing that. \n\nI feel like you're probably NTA here, although doing something together for Christmas (not necessarily gifts) could be a way to repair your relationship.", "Nta. Hes a dick.", "NTA. This friend literally asked you what you were getting him for Christmas, and then proceeded to call you materialistic? It really sounds like this \"friend\" thinks of you as $$$.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its not about the present its about the thought. He clearly doesn't value your friendship with the response you got. You have to decide if this is a friendship that is worth saving.
