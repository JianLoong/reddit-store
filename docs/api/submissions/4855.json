For some background my parents lost their home due to my dad not being able to find another job. We moved into my aunt and uncle\u2019s home in February but me and my brother (14M at the time) moved out into my BFs house because of the mental abuse that my uncle was doing to us.\n\nMy parents found a home in late August, right when school starts. My brother moved back in with them right away, I told them that I wanted to stay for a little to work on school and show them that I can balance school and work. Well a few weeks went by and I realized that I couldn\u2019t move back in with them anytime soon because the mental abuse they did to me as a kid and still do. \n\nI talked to my therapist about it and she agreed that I\u2019ve been doing mentally better since I\u2019ve moved out. I told my parents this and they didn\u2019t take it too well but understood, which I understand I\u2019m only 17. Well thanksgiving came around and I told them I\u2019d only wanted to stay one night (Wednesday to Thursday) because that\u2019s all I could handle and I wanted to still spend some of thanksgiving with my boyfriend. Well they didn\u2019t take that well and told me that my boyfriends family isn\u2019t my family and I\u2019m acting like I\u2019m married to my BF. To keep the peace I stayed one more night, but the entire time they made small comments about how I\u2019m a horrible daughter for not moving back in and how I ran away.\n\nWell it\u2019s Christmas time and apparently my dad wants me to stay for all of winter break there but I can\u2019t mentally handle it and told them that and they said they understand but are very disappointed in me and said we will be talking about me moving back in.\n\nThis is where I might be an Asshole, I told them \u201cThat there\u2019s nothing to talk about because I\u2019m already paying for my car, damages to my car, food and medical bills mine as well start paying for my phone too. Y\u2019all want me to move back in but I\u2019m already acting like an adult no need to move back in,\u201d They got upset with me and told me \u201cThat I\u2019m being selfish, they miss me and they need me to watch my siblings.\u201d I just hung up on them.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my BFs mom and she said that from a mothers point of view it is like you ran away from them and I might of over reacted a little. \n\nAm I The Asshole?", "created_utc": 1671157848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn3qli/aita_for_not_wanting_to_move_back_in_with_my/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They don\u2019t miss their child. They miss their babysitter. They miss the extra income from you having a job (assuming you paid rent, ect).  \n\nYou are absolutely not in the wrong, nor did you overreact.", "They need you to watch your siblings.  WTF?  NTA", "Nta they just want a babysitter. \n\nIf you're doing OK and your mental health is better then your parents might be toxic. It's not like you're on the street.", "NTA. Don't stay. They are guilt tripping you. Please leave. They just want you as a free babysitter.", "NTA.\n\nYou see the abuse. Your therapist notes the abuse. They need a babysitter. They miss you as a babysitter.", "Definitely NTA. You aren\u2019t obligated to be their babysitter and it sounds like that may be the only reason they want you back. Sure they probably miss you, but they could still see you while allowing you to maintain the independence that you\u2019ve currently achieved.", "They want you to be a live-in nanny. They\u2019re mad you\u2019re not willing to do it.\n\nAsk them why your brother can\u2019t be the nanny. They\u2019ll have some bullshit excuse. \n\nThey want to control you. That\u2019s not love. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - maybe you did run away, but from the sounds of it, it was the best thing you could have done.  From what you are telling us, they don't want you back because you are their daughter, they want you back to be a babysitter.  I really hope you can stay where you are because going back to your parents sounds like a really bad idea.  You are old enough to qualify for emancipated minor status; you might want to look into that.", "NTA for staying somewhere where you feel safe and don't have to deal with your abusive parents. While it might be hard on your parents for you to be living elsewhere, it doesn't give them the right to consistently make you feel crappy and call you a horrible daughter and try to guilt trip you. You are not being selfish by protecting your own mental health and well-being. They are being selfish by demanding your return, which they admitted was partially because they want you to watch your siblings.", "NTA. They don't care about you, they just want you for babysitting and free labor. And the audacity for them to call you selfish.", "NTA from the moral standpoint, as you do seem to be doing better separated from them, but check the laws in your region for the legality of you staying away. Depending of the jurisdiction, until you turn 18, they might have the power to forcibly bring you home and accuse your boyfriend of kidnapping.", "NTA \n\nLook up parentification. It\u2019s a form of child abuse. \nIf that resonates with you, stay away and continue living where you are. I\u2019m glad you have your therapists\u2019 support and that you are 18 soon. \n\nBest wishes Op!", "Hi \nI'm going to day nta but unless you live in Michigan or states with similar laws and or are emancipated, you living independently prior to 18 can open doors for legal issues for your parents. \n\nI'm surprised that your therapist being a mandated reporter hasn't involved child services to get involved \n\nI was in a simular position that you are in and maintaining a better than failing GPA while working full time to cover bills was nearly impossible. \n\nI hope you get the help you deserve and are able to focus on being a high-school student verses a fully functioning adult at only 17.", "NTA. They want a babysitter. They don't want you just for you.", "NTA. The order \"we *will* be talking about you moving back in\" sounds like they see you as something they control and not an autonomous individual. And then the hammer drops and we get the reveal that they just want a babysitter.", "NTA - And they listed missing you babysitting? That's one more reason not to go back.", "Im.hoping your Bfs parents have some legal paperwork signed by your parents that allow you to live there. Otherwise they could theoretically force you to move back or have his par ed nts charged with things like custodial interference and even contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Which, unless you are in Nebraska, means you have to return until age 18. In Nebraska it is 19. Not all police will bother dragging you home though and a lawyer might be able to get them emergency custody since yo have been there. Depends on the judge and their views of teen sex tbh. Good luck and talk to bfs parents. I.hope you get to stay where you feel safe and are doing well.", "The bigger problem I see is the BF mom might not want to let you stay there because it could be legally bad for her. How long until you\u2019re 18 and what\u2019s your backup plan if you are asked to leave? If the abuse is bad, shouldn\u2019t CPS be involved since your siblings are still there?", "NTA.  \n\nSo often I hear these stories where you distance from a family member(s) because they're treating you crappy, so you give them a chance.  And rather than be on their best behavior, they double down on being as crappy as possible.  It shows a complete lack of emotional maturity and just proves you are right.", "NTA.  Sorry you had to go thru that and may be you are doing better away from your parents.  I suggest you save as much money as possible to give you other options other than moving back home and in the meantime be as helpful and courteous to your bf's family as possible. Because she may not have planned for or want you to stay there indefinitely.  I say this due to you comment below.  That sounds like it could be a gentle way to try to get you to move back in w.your parents. \n\nYou said\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my BFs mom and she said that from a mothers point of view it is like you ran away from them and I might of over reacted a little.", "NTA, your family sound like incredibly selfish people who just want to use you as a verbal punching bag / free babysitter. I've had to distance myself from my family and I'm all the better for it, and kudos to you for having the courage to do so. My only advice would be to become self-sufficient as soon as you can manage it, because you don't want to be reliant on your boyfriend's family in case the relationship turns sour. Good luck OP", "NTA\nYou have no obligation to make your manipulative and abusive parents feel better at the expense of your safety, privacy and comfort. They are pushing back on your boundaries because they're boundary stompers.", "This is too complicated for an AH judgement. You say there is abuse occurring. If so, then obviously NTA. Leaving abuse is never an AH move. \n\nYour bfs mom is right,you did actually run away, because you no longer have their permission to live with your BF, but running away isn't about who is an AH. I echo your parents caution, do not get too attached that you are \"married\" to this BF. It's not a good idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ll definitely look into that.", "She\u2019s doesn\u2019t see the issue since my parents let me move out and she doesn\u2019t think my parents will get CPS involved because that\u2019ll just open up a case in them.", "I turn less than 2 months, and I have asked numerous times that if they are uncomfortable with me living there and they have told me no. And they don\u2019t abuse my siblings, it\u2019s just me. They act like my brother can\u2019t do no wrong, my sister as medical issues so she gets a pass, and since my mom was they youngest in her family she feels pity for my youngest sister so she\u2019s spoiled.", "Thank you for your comment, I plan on moving in with friends as soon as I turn 18. And she says she\u2019s okay with me living there as long as I try to work on my relationship with my parents. I have been trying but it\u2019s hard to do so when they make so many snarky comments, if that makes since. I want to have a good relationship with them.", "I plan too, as soon as I turn 18 Ima try and move in with some friends, hopefully it doesn\u2019t backfire.", "John\u2019s anger problem is John\u2019s anger problem. It\u2019s not your job to fill the gaps in child care. \n\nDon\u2019t go back. Live your life.", "Yes, actually. While it is unlikely that police will drag you home at this point, theoretically they can. So yes, look up the local laws on child custody and emancipation.", "The same thought was presented to me at that time,  I look back today and in anger realize I slipped through the cracks.  \nI think if my situation was reported I would not have had to get married very young and and or rely on others. \nIt may be scary but having cps or assistance will help you focus on your future rather than idea of sustaining for today.  \n\nI wish you the absolute best outcome possible", "I\u2019m glad they\u2019re okay with you being there.
