You shouldn't do it for free though, and stick to your decision.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in.  I can see the big red flags already.

It's shameful that he still needs his Mother to clean his room and clothes.", "Absolutely NTA, she was evicted from her old place and that is not your problem, they are adults and need to understand that although you are your son\u2019s parent, catering to him is no longer necessary, especially when he brings a girlfriend over under your roof.

It\u2019s fine to reevaluate a situation.

Seems like you are using it as an excuse to rearrange terms on your son. You don\u2019t have to have an excuse, your son doesn\u2019t respect your time or your home and that\u2019s plenty. \n\nEta- NTA, although I almost voted ESH because your real frustration is with your son but you allowed this to happen and need to take ownership of that fact.", "NTA!\nAt 25 your son is an adult and should start acting like one...", "NTA!

You didn't offer free rent to everyone, just your son and daughter. You can do whatever you want, and it's wise to set limits and charge rent for your son & his girlfriend to live with you.
