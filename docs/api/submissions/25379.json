Suna (20F) and Jae (25M). I am a widow, and am fortunate enough to have a well paying job as well as my late husbands life insurance. Once my children started working, I have always told them that I wouldn\u2019t ever ask them for rent, as I want them to save up for when they would either move out or if they would want to pursue higher education. We live in a three bed room apartment for roughly $2200 a month. \n\nFor further context, my daughter is a fairly independent person and cooks her own meals, takes care of her own laundry and even helps me around the house with the cleaning. She even gives me about $200 biweekly just to help out. \n\nI cannot say the same for Jae, as I usually have to clean his room and do his laundry because he lets it pile up in the laundry room. As for my meals and Jae\u2019s, I only end up cooking for myself as my son usually eats out or eats at his girlfriends house. \n\nMy son had recently asked if his girlfriend, Anais (23F) would be able to move in, as she\u2019s being evicted due to some issues with her landlord. Anais is a very sweet girl but we don\u2019t interact much as she doesn\u2019t come over too often. Her and Jae have been dating for about a year. \n\nI told him that his girlfriend moving in would undoubtedly change the rule I had set in place about charging rent. This is because as a couple, they\u2019d need to have some set responsibilities, just as they\u2019d have if they would rent a room someplace else or move into an apartment. I told him rent would be $750 a month, how they split it is up to them. I also let him know that they are more than welcome to use any of the groceries I buy, they can even request me to bring certain stuff home when I go to the market, but I will not be cooking for them. I also let him know I would not be cleaning their room nor will I be in charge of doing their laundry. \n\nMy son was enraged and started demanding why I am doing a sudden 180. I told him that he\u2019s a grown man and these are things a couple should find a solution to. I told him that he can either agree to these requests or him and Anais would have to find someplace else to live. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me in three days. I understand why he feels like I might be unfair, since I did say I wouldn\u2019t charge him rent, but adding an extra person to the household is an exception to that rule. My daughter understands why her brother is upset but ultimately agrees with me in that I should not be the one to take up what should be their responsibilities.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692850055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zqysr/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_him_and_his/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I would be very, very careful about letting someone move in knowing they had been evicted from the last place.", "NTA you should have stopped doing his laundry a long time ago. His dirty underwear can pile up in his room (which he also should have been cleaning himself for a long time) for all you should care. It sounds as though he has no idea of how to adult, at 25. That's bad news for Anais. You'd be doing her a big favour by giving her an unblemished view of how well he can take care of himself and things, which she probably isn't getting currently. You shouldn't do it for free though, and stick to your decision.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in.  I can see the big red flags already.  You should also tell him that his maid is retiring forthwith, and start charging him rent!  Your son will only get worse with age, just like the smell of cheese.", "NTA - but why isn't a 25 year old paying rent - and doing his own laundry???", "NTA. You're right, he is a grown man. It's shameful that he still needs his Mother to clean his room and clothes.", "Absolutely NTA, she was evicted from her old place and that is not your problem, they are adults and need to understand that although you are your son\u2019s parent, catering to him is no longer necessary, especially when he brings a girlfriend over under your roof. There\u2019s also the point where it\u2019s your house your rules, you seem to be pretty generous with the rent and groceries.", "NTA. \n\nBut stop enabling him. Stop cleaning for him. If he can\u2019t keep it clean and you don\u2019t like that, then he needs to move out. \n\nHe\u2019s 22. Stop babying him. \n\nThe entire reason he\u2019s mad is because you\u2019ve spent his entire life coddling him and cleaning up after him.", "NTA- For saying you'd charge rent but maybe for allowing a 25yo capable grown man to live at home and think being mothered how you do is actually acceptable or even normal.   \nThere's no way.   \nI mean an adult who's not capable sure but unless you left out a disability or something this is insane and he needs to learn to be an independent adult.", "Son is an a@@ and you would be a fool to let the GF move in. Your son, obviously, is acting very entitled and that is your fault. You aren\u2019t doing him any favors by Molly coddling him.   He should cook, clean, and wash up after himself. It\u2019s time to change the behavior and let him grow up.", "Honestly it sounds like girlfriend or not, you\u2019re tired of your son\u2019s rent-free taking advantage of you. It\u2019s fine to reevaluate a situation. Even if GF stays out l would give him a couple of months notice and start charging $400 a month (what his sister pays) because he needs to be more respectful and responsible, and when people pay for things they value them more.\n\nIt\u2019s odd that the girlfriend moving in was some big catalyst. Seems like you are using it as an excuse to rearrange terms on your son. You don\u2019t have to have an excuse, your son doesn\u2019t respect your time or your home and that\u2019s plenty. \n\nEta- NTA, although I almost voted ESH because your real frustration is with your son but you allowed this to happen and need to take ownership of that fact.", "NTA!\nAt 25 your son is an adult and should start acting like one...", "NTA! Your son is a grown ass man, you clearly have been coddling him a bit too much by cleaning his room, doing his laundry, cooking for him etc, and honestly he\u2019s upset because it sounds like he was raised to feel entitled. \n\nI can\u2019t help but notice the gender divide between the two as well, and it makes me think that you raised your son to think that as the first born/male everyone else would take care of him, but your daughter had to learn that she had to take care of herself. \n\nI know that you can\u2019t go back and reraise your son to be a better person, but it\u2019s way past time that he learns that lesson. Honestly, you should make them pay rent and let him know that in a year, he will be expected to move out and start life on his own. That poor gf though is going to be in a terrible place when he inevitably starts trying to force her to do all the things you have been doing.", "NTA. You didn't offer free rent to everyone, just your son and daughter. You can do whatever you want, and it's wise to set limits and charge rent for your son & his girlfriend to live with you. He's 25 and isn't very considerate now, since he doesn't keep his room clean and leaves his laundry piled up in the laundry room. If his girlfriend follows his example, you'll have two adults to clean up after. \n\nWe've had our adult kids live with us rent-free several times. Only one was considerate, like your daughter is; the others were not successful at being part of an adult household.", "NTA. Even with rent, I'd be concerned and want to know more about why she is being evicted. Was she consistently late with her rent in her last living situation ?", "NTA.

He\u2019s 25 and he and his girlfriend should be on their own. \n\nYour responsibility to provide for him ended a long time ago and you\u2019ve been nice to allow him to continue to live with you far into adulthood and not charge him rent\n\nAnother person in the house will change the dynamic and no you\u2019re not going to do their laundry or cook for them or take care of them\n\nNTA", "NTA. You should start charging him rent anyways and make him clean up as those are skills he needs to gain for his own good and he should learn them sooner than later.", "NTA- I understand your reasoning and point however I can see his to and I agree with the grounds you have set all except not charging the daughter I know you said she gives you money however if your son adding a person automatically raises his rent from $0 to $750 then you should work out and actual rule with the daughter that she also needs to not just if she wants to(not as much maybe just half as she is only one person vs two people) and the only reason I say this is because if she decides she doesn\u2019t want to pay you then she gets to live at home for free vs your son who has to pay you $750. I do understand why however in the long run it won\u2019t end up being fair and will most likely cause even further issues. \nI have experienced this first hand with my sisters 2 of them lived at home for a while after they graduated one paid rent to my mom one didn\u2019t it cause a lot of drama and fights now the one who paid rent hasn\u2019t spoken to my mom in 2 years. So that is my advice based on my experience.", "NTA\n\n\nDoes he think of you as his maid?", "OP how would your son survive if you weren't around?  That's the question you need to ask yourself.  Your daughter obviously could survive from what you've posted, but if your son can't even do his own laundry, cook for himself, etc. and he's expecting you to do the same thing for his girlfriend if she moves in (you offered them free groceries).  How is that going to help him?  You're not promised tomorrow, so you have to ask yourself why would you want to set him up to fail by treating him like a child by doing everything for him?", "NTA.

He's a grown-up!\n\n>My son was enraged / He hasn\u2019t spoken to me in three days\n\nLet him know that your generosity doesn't extend to people who are rude and disrespectful towards you.

Be proud of yourself!", "Your not the ass your son just need to put his big boy pants on", "You are to soft why you cleaned his room and washing in the first place I don't know he got used to that you are not his servant you are completely right make them pay and wash and clean own room", "NTA At 25 he should be doing all his own laundry, cleaning, cooking and shopping as well. \nHe has no right to claim you are reneging on a verbal deal - he is changing the \u2018contract\u2019 by bringing in an extra unrelated person to YOUR home.

She should have stopped cleaning his room 15 years ago at least and stopped doing his laundry at the very least when he became an adult. If he leaves piles of laundry in the laundry room, he should be told that that's not how adults behave and to stop doing that or he'll have to leave. \n\nI don't want to blame OP for how he's turning out, but she's at least partly to blame. The good news is he does have time to learn to be an adult, but if she doesn't do anything soon, there'll be no hope and he'll be a useless adult forever.", "He should pay more because it\u2019s 2 people. Not one", "*twenty five year old* son. By no means should he have to be a dependent at this age. Sounds like he's lucked out with a great mom to take care of him, despite the passing of his father, but holy cow a kid's gotta move on. 750 is 1/3 of rent for using 1/3 of the rooms available, makes perfect sense. Not to much he can split that with his GF. He has no obligation to take her in and continue to live rent free if need be and she can look elsewhere. Definitely agree NTA but I think it's absolutely within fair reason \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "not in this economy that's actually really normal price and even cheap in some areas", "I mean $400 even if GF doesn\u2019t move in."]}
