You shouldn't do it for free though, and stick to your decision.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in.  I can see the big red flags already.

It's shameful that he still needs his Mother to clean his room and clothes.", "Absolutely NTA, she was evicted from her old place and that is not your problem, they are adults and need to understand that although you are your son\u2019s parent, catering to him is no longer necessary, especially when he brings a girlfriend over under your roof.

It\u2019s fine to reevaluate a situation.

Seems like you are using it as an excuse to rearrange terms on your son. You don\u2019t have to have an excuse, your son doesn\u2019t respect your time or your home and that\u2019s plenty. \n\nEta- NTA, although I almost voted ESH because your real frustration is with your son but you allowed this to happen and need to take ownership of that fact.", "NTA!\nAt 25 your son is an adult and should start acting like one...", "NTA!

You didn't offer free rent to everyone, just your son and daughter. You can do whatever you want, and it's wise to set limits and charge rent for your son & his girlfriend to live with you.

It\u2019s sad and hilarious your younger daughter is more of a capable and responsible adult than he is. If I were you I\u2019d kick him out for doing nothing to help you out and mooching off of you.", "NTA. You need to stop doing his laundry and cleaning his room. He\u2019s an adult but you have been facilitating his lack of growth. This sort of immature reaction is somewhat predictable from a person who has never been responsible for looking after himself. \n\nFrom the age of around 6 or 7 I was expected to clean my own room, I learned how to use the washer/dryer around 12, and my mom started teaching me how to cook around 12-13. I moved out of my parents house at 18 and knew how to be a functional adult, at least in terms of taking care of myself at home.\n\nDo you want to clean up after your son until the day you die?", "NTA but regardless of how the living situation works out please stop enabling him to avoid other adult responsibilities.\n\nThe housing situation in this country is messed up, laundry is very much a solvable problem.", "NTA. At 25 I qualified as a psychiatric Nurse, living with my partner. He's being enabled by you doing everything for him.", "NTA\nIf your son can't even do his own laundry how does he expect to bring someone else to live.", "I find that it's okay for a parent to not charge their children rent, especially when they want to support them in this crazy economy. However, you are doing his chores for him, which enables him to not do his own chores. It's primarily your apartment, so I understand why you'd want to keep it clean. When you continue to clean for him, I advise you to send a bill for all your services. As for the gf issue, a dynamic shifts when another person lives in the house, and I think you are NTA for charging g rent. His gf will be expected to pay rent anywhere else, why should she get a free ride here? Tell your son if he is unhappy with your decision,  his gf can still rent your place and pay the full rent herself.", "Nta. Sounds fair to me. Might give the son a dose of real world living", "NTA. Sounds like he thought the free ride and maid/chef service would be included for his girlfriend, who comes with the giant red flag of being evicted. \n\nHe is an adult. They should be moving into a place of their own or at least paying you and taking care of all his and gf\u2019s responsibilities independently.", "OP - draw up a contract with a lawyer that includes a 30, 60, or 90-day notice as of XX/XX/20XX Joe will be seen now as a roommate or tenant and will be exited to act as such. Do not let the Gf live with you until he has at least a full year of excellent roommate/tenant behavior.\r  \n\\-Being responsible for own messes in shared spaces\r  \n\\-Cooking and cleaning up after themselves --unless you agree to share a meal together then you clean up together or however you divide it.\r  \n\\-Own Laundry\r  \n... OP you get the idea the lawyer with help you keep some things vague and you come up with a division of duties chart or rubric of cleanliness standard that you can both agree on for passing It's good enough vs eat off of...\r  \nOr else it's time for him to move out and figure things out.\r  \nNTA  \n\\-Edit: Paying some level of rent because it's part of the deal whether it's $200 like you're daughter is paying already or $750 like you're suggesting...", "NTA. Absolutely NTA.\n\nStop doing his laundry. If it stays in a pile in the laundry area it stays in a pile in the laundry area. And charging rent to a couple is perfectly reasonable - 1/3 as you are charging seems fine to me.\n\nIf you weren't there he'd have no choice about fending for himself and paying rent. Remind him of that.", "NTA I\u2019m 25 still live at home and do my own laundry/ cook and clean for the entire house instead of rent", "NTA but he needs to start doing his own cleaning and laundry", "NTA you've damaged your son by letting him live this way so far. He's not a man. His development has been stunted.", "NTA He\u2019s a 25 year old man. He should be doing these things himself anyway and be greatfull for what you\u2019ve already done for him.", "Personally I would think twice about letting someone move in who I've hardly met. Could your son and his girl not move somewhere else and you maybe offer to provide a meal a couple of nights a week and some support if they struggle? Or help her get a temporary place to live and then at least meet her regularly. You are NTA. You need to feel comfortable in your own home and if someone is taking the p ( regardless of son or not) then deal with it. It sounds a bit, if you don't mind me saying, he's been taking the p for quite a bit now and there is no guarantee if his girl moves in, they both won't take the p out of you.\n\nYou can change the goalposts as they are your goalposts. I would also check as in the UK  you can't move someone in just like that on a tenancy as the landlord has to agree and usually charges you extortionate money to change everything. \n\nGood luck and best wishes.", "NTA", "YTA because you've spoiled him. Cleaning his room? A 25 year old, grown man? Come on.\n\nNTA for finally putting your foot down, but this should have been done at least a decade ago.", "Doing all those things for your son...he is going to be someones nightmare when he gets way older. He is going to expect his gf to do for him do for him, and sit and watch as she nearly kills herself trying to do for him, and he sits and watches. Youre nta, but need to cut those apron strings. From a woman that got stuck with a person like that and didnt find out until i had to stop working because of a illness.", "I mean, it's just facts", "NTA I anyway!!\nYou go momma!!!", "ESH You still clean his room at 23, and you are surprised he is throwing a tantrum?\n\nMy guess is he'll move her in, not pay you, and you will clean the room for both of them.\n\nThey aren't going to pay you anyway. That's why the girlfriend was evicted .", "NTA, and I don't ever endorse banding around certain diagnosis and it's absolutely not an excuse but... Is your son on the autism scale at all?\n\nHis age and reaction - the withdrawal and tantrum make me think it's a possibility.\n\nI still think it's right for his girlfriend and him to clean their own room and create their own meals. Tis not a hotel!", "NTA But you have been enabling him by the sounds of it.  But if he\u2019s moving his gf in now is the time to set new rules and boundaries and most importantly stick to them.", "NTA for requiring the rent and telling him they\u2019ll have to do certain things, but you are the AH to yourself and the rest of the world for raising an entitled person. Why are you not requiring he clean his own room and do his own laundry? He is acting entitled because he\u2019s never been held responsible for anything. It\u2019s not surprising he\u2019s throwing a tantrum now. \n\nThose are all reasonable things and the chores are things he should have been responsible for by high school at the latest. I was cleaning my own room from the time I was a little kid, and cleaning the house and doing laundry well before high school. Unless he has some kind of disability that prevents him from doing these tasks there\u2019s no excuse for him not handling them himself.", "NTA, I get a lot of it. but I would probably make different arrangements with cooking, assuming not everyone can cook at the same time.\n\nI would appoint days to who cooks.", "This. You\u2019ll also need to add them to the lease so your rent will probably go up.", "Since rent is one of life\u2019s biggest expenses, you shouldn\u2019t really let them not get used to that expense.", "Agreed with this as NTA but I\u2019m gonna say, even after I moved out and my mom would come over she would take care of my laundry and tidy my apartment even after I told her she didn\u2019t need to. It did work work out mainly for her because I lived close to her work and she would come over on her lunch breaks, make something for herself and take a nap. I miss that amazing woman. When I did live with her after she divorced my dad I would gladly pay her rent and help with food and other things even if she didn\u2019t ask.", "Him not paying rent is up to OP. But he can't do his own basic chores???", "Ikr if you're still living with your parents the least you can do is do your own laundry or do the dishes.", "Tbh, the rent may be a cultural thing. Where i live, no one pays rent to their family. If not for reddit, i would not know this is a thing either", "and cleaning his own room?!?", "You could charge the going rent and then keep it and surprise them with a house deposit. But I would caution letting someone into the house without checking with Landlord first as in the UK you can get in bother if you let someone else move in not named on the tenancy.", "He needs to launder them first! His big boy pants are probably on the laundry room floor.", "But the daughter pays 400 a month.  She is not living there for free.", "I look after my teenager as they have long covid but I still clean their room. We've had a few rows but the ground rules are clean home and easy access of you can't do it then it still needs doing. I get them to help with what they can. It's difficult sometimes to break a habit and I hope they will help more as they get better.", "I started at 12", "I kinda do want to partly blame OP. 20-yr-old daughter takes care of herself as an adult. 25-yr-old son doesn't. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it seems likely the daughter has been raised to think that's her job, and son has been raised to think it's a woman's job to look after him :/", "right how does an adult live comfortably knowing they are 25 and are not self sufficient, embarrassing, if he ever moves out man will probably call mom asking how long to put popcorn in a microwave", " I know I stated that but that\u2019s her choice I\u2019m saying make it an actual rule and the for free comment was because again her choice so she could decide to stop and not start again", "I started at 8", "I was a fetus when I started", "When I was 8 I boiled and starched my own linens, and then started work full time as a laundress.", "We lived in a rollup newspaper in 't middle of the road.", "You had a newspaper?  I just had road tar."]}
