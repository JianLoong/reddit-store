You shouldn't do it for free though, and stick to your decision.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in.  I can see the big red flags already.

It's shameful that he still needs his Mother to clean his room and clothes.", "Absolutely NTA, she was evicted from her old place and that is not your problem, they are adults and need to understand that although you are your son\u2019s parent, catering to him is no longer necessary, especially when he brings a girlfriend over under your roof.

It\u2019s fine to reevaluate a situation.

Seems like you are using it as an excuse to rearrange terms on your son. You don\u2019t have to have an excuse, your son doesn\u2019t respect your time or your home and that\u2019s plenty. \n\nEta- NTA, although I almost voted ESH because your real frustration is with your son but you allowed this to happen and need to take ownership of that fact.", "NTA!\nAt 25 your son is an adult and should start acting like one...", "NTA!

You didn't offer free rent to everyone, just your son and daughter. You can do whatever you want, and it's wise to set limits and charge rent for your son & his girlfriend to live with you.

In fact your son has been \"taking the piss\" in how he has been behaving at home and it's not respectful at all for someone his age to leave his bedroom in a pigsty and not even do his own laundry. It's about time he learnt how to adult and it's not like it's fully being an adult because $750/month and that includes all utilities and food and all he and his girlfriend have to do is keep their space clean, cook their own meals and do their own laundry. That's a pretty sweet deal tbh.\n\nOne thing I would also suggest you consider is, why did she get kicked out? Is it due to non-payment of rent, destruction of property, inappropriate behaviour (ie loud parties etc). Find out the why and consider if she is even someone you would be happy to have in your home.

Better said than me.", "I\u2019m sure if her daughter didn\u2019t clean her own room and laundry, mom would do it for her too. It\u2019s just that females are cleaner and it\u2019s no surprise to me that the daughter would take it upon herself. Dudes are the opposite, if he actually had his own place it would be just as messy without a doubt. The mom doing his laundry and cleaning up after him is just her wanting a clean house. Now that he wants his girlfriend to move in, she doesn\u2019t want to do that stuff for him anymore bc she\u2019ll have to decipher what\u2019s his and what\u2019s hers and she shouldn\u2019t have to do that. She has every right to put up boundaries with someone who isn\u2019t her child. And if he wants to let another person into the house with his family there\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t pay rent and clean up after themselves. In my opinion OP is NTA, I wish I had a parent who could charge me just a fraction of the rent and let me move my SO in.", "Not really. I'm not a landlord, but I've had enough experiences on the other side that people usually get evicted for1 of 2 reasons. Not paying or completely fucking shit up in a place. Doesn't sound like a pay issue based on what the son said (could be since he balked at how he would have to pay rent now), but more like a violated lease issue (got a pet, had friends overnight that were not supposed to be, broke things in the house, made a mess of the place, etc.)", "It seems to be a mum thing. My mum recently visited me (I am living abroad) and I told her I had been working OT to take time off when she was here so the place was a bit of a mess and she offered to clean.\n\nMy nan always cleans the oven when she visits my mum too, that woman loves to clean ovens", "I\u2019m the oldest and have raised children of my own, but my 75-year-old mother doesn\u2019t know how to not help. She comes over and starts on some project. I now keep a couple small things ready for her\u2014like mending, so at least she\u2019ll sit down for a moment. Love that woman.", "There's a chance the kids were BOTH raised the same way, but the daughter saw the burden on her mother, whereas the son didn't.\n\nSome people will just continue to take advantage, whereas others would hate doing that.", "I'd cut her some slack on it (even if continuing to clean and do the laundry for him so long certainly didn't help): at this age, lots of women I knew wanted to be independent and self-sufficing while lots of boys still basked in momma's care. Maybe because we women are infantilized enough as it is on a daily basis, we want to act sooner like adults? And if all your friends find it normal to clean for yourself, you'll start to think so too. If on the contrary your friend's laundry and meals are still handled by their moms, you won't find it weird if yours still do it too.", "I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole for wanting to establish rules for a new tenant/roommate. But they\u2019ve done their son a huge disservice for not having established similar rules before this.", "ok i skipped the comment above because it was long but i'm gonna scroll back up and read it", "Uhhh was it an actual eduction? As in, ordered by a court and enforced by a sheriff? \n\nOr was this more of the run of the mill \u201ctime to move out we want the house back\u201d letters?", "Yeah, I'm not a landlord, and I'm side-eyeing that story. I'm in the US where cross-racial identification is definitely an issue, but I wouldn't buy that a Chinese person thought one Taiwanese person was a different person every time because of his clothing.", "It sure was an adventure.", "Frequently, in fact!", "That's...not really how rents or increases work. The landlord couldn't increase the rent in the middle of the lease term. They could potentially try to increase it when it comes time to renew the lease, but they would probably do that anyway periodically.\n\nMore likely they'd just get denied.", "I don't know that a landlord would have much say in this depending on the state. The landlord may want to raise rates, but there are some things called laws that sometimes prevent them from eaking out every crumb of profit they could possibly generate.", "In some places it is. That\u2019s definitely a thing.\n\nSource: am 50 and have lived in *plenty* of apartments", "It absolutely is based on the number of tenants in some apartments. Before hurling insults, you should make sure you're right.", "Lol ok buddy", "Which is great, but one of the things about kids in their mid-teens is that they are simultaneously convinced that their parents owe it to them to continue doing things for them, and that the world should recognize that they are great big grown-ups now who deserve freedom and self-determination (funded by their parents). They don't consciously believe that, but a kid who doesn't display that assumption in one way or another is unusual indeed. It's normal for them to feel that way, because they are at a strange in-between stage, but apparently there is now a 25 year old man who feels that way.", "Agree with this. Also, it may have affected the kids differently when their dad died, depending on their ages. They have to find a new normal pretty quickly, and it can be easy to miss developmentally-appropriate milestones when the shit's piling up. I'm inclined to give OP a pass too, but it's time to cut the strings", "Teenage girls do more housework than teenage boys on average and we as a society expect and enable it.", "He could just not renew the lease, which doesn't put a black mark on their record. Having had an eviction filed against them is going to make it much harder and more costly to rent elsewhere for the rest of their lives.", "It's the landlord's house, but the tenant's home. This restricts landlords in a lot of ways. Evictions can have lifelong consequences for people, so getting an eviction on your record when you didn't do anything wrong is understandably galling. All the landlord had to do was not renew the lease and they would have had to move anyway, but it wouldn't have made their future attempts at renting harder.", "There's a lot of places that will not rent to you if you have ever been evicted. Regaining possession for this is perfectly legit.  Filing an eviction so they have a harder time renting and generally having to pay more rent for the rest of their lives when they didn't do anything wrong is shitty.", "Moving another person in changes things, though. The landlord can refuse to let Anais move in as she's not on the lease. You can't just move people in during your lease term, or you're violating your lease, in which case the rent can be re-negotiated because you'd have to sign a new one.", "The lease may specify a maximum number of occupants but there are rarely restrictions on family members living with the lessee.", "Idk where you live but given the fact that theres a ton of cities in the US that saw 30%+ average rent increases last year thats not necessarily true", "Maybe in that 7 years you should have saved up for a down payment on your own home. The gall to call it your own home when you just occupied it for a monthly fee is so entitled. If it's not your property you have to fully expect you can be asked to leave after any lease is up.", "Landlords can increase rents. They can not arbitrarily increase rents in the middle of the lease if there is no provision for it.", "If you have a month to month lease they absolutely can (which is what any tenant/renter contract is typically considered if they dont have a formal lease)", "Well, no. With a month to month lease changes still happen at the end of the lease term unless agreed upon by both parties. Does the lease term end much more frequently than longer leases? Yes of course, but if your lease is August 1st to September 1st and the partner moves in on August 5th, the landlord can't charge them more money for August.", "Sure. But you also according to most leases \\*cant just move someone else in\\*. \n\nEvery lease I have ever signed has a clause that you cannot have someone living there for more than x days without them being on the lease. So by your own logic, the GF cant even move in until the terms of the lease are updated.", "That watery tart!"]}
