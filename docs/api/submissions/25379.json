You shouldn't do it for free though, and stick to your decision.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in.  I can see the big red flags already.

Your son will only get worse with age, just like the smell of cheese.", "NTA - but why isn't a 25 year old paying rent - and doing his own laundry???", "NTA. You're right, he is a grown man. It's shameful that he still needs his Mother to clean his room and clothes.", "Absolutely NTA, she was evicted from her old place and that is not your problem, they are adults and need to understand that although you are your son\u2019s parent, catering to him is no longer necessary, especially when he brings a girlfriend over under your roof.

It\u2019s fine to reevaluate a situation.

Seems like you are using it as an excuse to rearrange terms on your son. You don\u2019t have to have an excuse, your son doesn\u2019t respect your time or your home and that\u2019s plenty. \n\nEta- NTA, although I almost voted ESH because your real frustration is with your son but you allowed this to happen and need to take ownership of that fact.", "NTA!\nAt 25 your son is an adult and should start acting like one...", "NTA!

You didn't offer free rent to everyone, just your son and daughter. You can do whatever you want, and it's wise to set limits and charge rent for your son & his girlfriend to live with you.

You should have told him to play grown-up a while ago.", "NTA, as I am absolutely against charging kids rent (i mean like it's their home too, it's family home, why would you charge kids rent, unless they are out of school and have stable work and it naturally came to them being equally equipped in adult life), but he wants to bring another person and a stranger to the house - outside of personal doubts it means increase in utilities, increase in groceries, increase in mess in the house. You are not responsible to compensate for a stranger.", "Jeeez, can I move in under those conditions?", "You need to think of this like a landlord.  Teh girl is being evited and for what reason?  Was her old landlord sick of her?  Maybe she damage the place or couldnt follow a lease?  You may be inheriting that landlord's problems and then she comes to live in your place.  Once a person legally acquires tenant rights, it is an uphill struggle to get rid of them and you usually need to resort to the courts & legal action.  You should find out if your jurisdiction is tenant or landlord friendly bc once you start renting to someone (including your son) you are a landlord in the eyes of the law.\n\nYour son sounds incredibly immature.  I think a likely outcome is this couple lives under your roof and she gets pregnant and now you are babysitter.  Id tell your son this is not a hotel.  She can find her own place.  NTA", "NTA. The conditions have changed so the terms must change. Also, your son should be doing his own laundry.", "NTA. Why you're still doing his laundry now has me scratching my head \ud83e\udd14. He's plenty old enough to clean his room and wash his own clothes. You're not doing him or any future partner any favors by letting him rely on you for these adult tasks. If you do agree, have a sit down with both of them and have a discussion on your expectations and perhaps write up a subletting agreement. If they don't agree, then it's time for him to fly the nest. Good luck!", "NTA \n\nJust tell him that if he can find a place to live rent free with his girl that he is more than welcome to move there instead.\n\nWelcome to adulthood pal", "He is a grown man!!! Stop cleaning his room even if she doesn\u2019t move in op, stop coddling him; Nta", "Info: Why the hell are you still doing his laundry and cleaning his room???", "Nta his gf isn\u2019t your child. Your honestly correcting a mistake. You shouldn\u2019t still be cleaning up after him. Also do you know he is saving money while he lives there? 4 adults for a 3 bedroom sounds cramped", "Not the asshole. You said you wouldn\u2019t ask your children for rent. You said nothing about not asking invitees of your children for rent. In the first statement, a reasonable person can make the valid assumption that the rule applies only to your single children, not the SOs of your children. Getting more people into the mix changes the whole dynamic and requires new rules.", "NTA. You would be doing Jae a disservice if you patronize his immature views.", "You don\u2019t know why she was evicted. Could be using/ selling drugs, being drunk and causing disturbances, not paying rent, destroying the apartment, fighting with neighbors\u2026 Since you\u2019re contemplating being her new landlord, I\u2019d call over to her last apartment and ask.  Either way, I wouldn\u2019t allow either one of them to live there. Son needs to get out on his own at this point. Time for tough love, Mom.  I would NOT let her move in. If they want to be adults and live together, let them be adults in their own place. And, don\u2019t forget she\u2019ll be pregnant soon (I can almost guarantee it.) Then, you\u2019ve got a whole new issue. Better to have them both out on their own. Get them started with one month\u2019s rent somewhere and be done with it.", "Anais seems not to have figured out adulting either with getting evicted.", "In OP's case I get it, but it feels insane to me that people will charge their children rent under normal circumstances.", "In some cultures, especially South Asia they don\u2019t encourage children to move out before marriage. Parents like to keep you around as long as possible, and sometimes see their kids living alone as shameful if they aren\u2019t married. I had to \u201crun away\u201d at the big age of 21 just to have some independence and peace of mind lol. And my parents are typically progressive for my country. It\u2019s just not as big of a deal to live at home.  \n\nThat being said, OP\u2019s son should do more chores and lift some weight around the house. He is being babied.", "No can do they\u2019re down as he enjoys his girlfriend oops did I actually type that out loud yes I think I did", "And to add seems like he's more angry he can't move his gf in and still live rent free with no responsibility.", "Depending on where they live it could not be her fault at all. Australia is in the middle of a nation wide housing crisis with rent increases of anywhere between 30% and 150% are becoming common. Her landlord issues could be pure greed.", "People will only tell you the landlords bad bit and never anything they did wrong. 100 percent his gf was probably not honest as to why she got evicted.", " It's his daughter who would be the only one with a legit reason to complain.", "Sounds like OP has a 15 yr old with 10 years experience.", "This \u261d\ufe0f \ud83d\udcaf", "Yep, OP is definitely reaping what she sowed.", "At the LEAST the son could politely ask Mom to do his laundry - maybe she will maybe she won\u2019t her choice - but to dump it and walk away? Entitled", "My husband and I got an eviction notice handed to us because our landlord wanted our home for his daughter. Fuck landlords right in the ear.", "[deleted]", "Wouldn't they just say she can't afford her rent anymore if that were the case though", "Pure greed.... like expecting to live with your boyfriends family for free? I realize that entitled and not greed, but come on, nothing is free.", "Either is possible, tbh.", "You leave my cheese outa this! I love me some mature cheddhaaa! \ud83d\ude0b \ud83e\udd24\nLife is always better with extra cheese! \ud83e\uddc0", "Hey cheese did nothing, leave it alone !", "That happens all the time here now.  There's a difference between a lease not being renewed and an eviction here.  Any new rental you apply for has a form where you're supposed to tick a box indicating whether or not you've ever been evicted before.  No box to explain why.  It's an automatic rejection if you say yes.", "Maybe I'm wrong but isn't it the landlord's place and they can put who they want in the house?", "What does any of this have to do with the US? I didn't mention a country, none of this happened in the US, and none of the people involved were from the US.", "We have no idea what the gf expects. We only have what OP said and their sons reaction to this.", "They're supposed to give notice to vacate first a reasonable time ahead, so you can leave volountarily without an eviction on your record.", "Sorry, but the eviction notice where I live is the notice to vacate and there's no eviction on your record.    Just done differently.", "And if you told young redditors of today...they wouldn't believe you! Bah.", "Did you have a sword?"]}
