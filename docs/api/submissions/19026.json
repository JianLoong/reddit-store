It can be prevented entirely", "Info: is there any reason for you to believe your brothers have done or said anything even remotely inappropriate? Your story could  indicate your grandmother took upon herself to comment on your choice of clothing (which grandmother are known to do on occasion) and used your brother as an excuse to make her point", "YWNBTA your grandma was taught the wrong values when she was growing up, it is definitely necessary for those kids to learn that they are responsible for their own actions and women are allowed to be comfortable in their own body especially at their own house. still it sounds like she was the problem and not the boys or your dad/stepmom, so she might have just made that up and the boys have not actually thought about any of that. maybe you can just mention what she said to them to make sure that it isnt a problem.", "No YWNBTA however I do question whether you are jumping to conclusions that there is a double standard based on sex. I'm sure there is, but maybe there isn't. It is not unreasonable to have the conversation.", "YTA. Boys at that age are very biologically reactive to sights, and it doesn't take much.  You have a fundamental ignorance of biology if you think they are sexualizing you.

I'm really stuck on this point.", "it's just what his mom says. I guess I should've known it was off because sometimes she doesn't say the smartest things. I apologize.", "Yea, that sounded off.", "I'm never really home so I can only think of one occasion, and I don't even really know what it was about. Before I started staying out of the house more, the boys had a friend over one time. I don't know why but the younger one and his friend decided to just peer in my door and giggle. I was just sitting playing video games so idk", ">She said that she was asked to tell me not to walk \"like that\" to my room anymore\n\nFrom this line, someone has apparently addressed the issue with grandma, and it was probably OP's stepmother (the father could have easily spoken with OP).\n\nWhat I am not so sure is if they, in fact, asked grandma to talk to OP. The convo could have been something like \"I wish OP would cover herself more, bEcAuSe Of ThE cHiLdReN\" and grandma took upon herself to talk to OP about it.", "I can see where you come from. However, this would be a good opportunity to teach the boys that it's not ok to act on their biological responses. You cannot control what makes you horny. And if it's your own sister (which OP not even is) then it is what it is. But they should also be taught that they aren't allowed to act on their horniness. Let them wank to a woman in a towel, but they cannot wank in her presence which should be common curtesy.", "its more about the fact that down syndrome is very clearly visible on anyone so if you have it, anyone can see it, there are clear face structures for people with down syndrome that cant be confused with something else. im thinking the OP might have mixed it up with autism, since autism is not a disorder that you can see in physical features maybe they meant to say that he has down syndrome and might have autism?", "Well it wasn\u2019t until 2018 newborn screening became mandatory in all states in the USA. That said yeah it\u2019s quite far off. you are not their biological sister, he didn\u2019t even grow up with you, and at 17 are a full grown woman physically. As a pubescent he maybe right the age to be curios, independently from his conditions, about women body\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say a towel is scandalizing at all but in the mind of a boy. Its not such a crazy wacko request.", "oh, i missed that part. if that was true then yes it should definitely be a discussion made at home", "He's been diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. my step mom is the one that claimed the doctors think he \"may\" have down syndrome. I didn't know enough about disorders to know better. I'm sorry.", "Most down syndrom is very visible but there is also mosaic down syndrom. \n\nhttps://library.down-syndrome.org/en-us/news-update/02/3/needs-mosaic-down-syndrome-families/#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20children%20with,parents%20have%20discussed%20with%20us.\n\n\"Some of the children with Mosaic Down syndrome that we know do not actually look as if they have Down syndrome - the usual physical features are not obvious.\"\n\n\nBut it is super unlikely they wouldn't have tested it and actually know, as it seems this kid is diagnosed with other stuff.", "Not necessarily  - mosaic down syndrome exists, where there's a spontaneous mutation in a cell *after* the egg has started dividing.  This means only some cell lines are affected.\n\nDepending on the timing of this, and the particular types of cells which gain the extra chromosome,  there can be a range of effects.  For testing purposes, you'd have to test an affected cell for it to show up.", "Agreed.", "yeah that was my bad but as the other person pointed out, he should definitely be checked for down syndrome already, most likely as a baby and especially after being diagnosed with other disorders", "It's pretty rare but definitely a thing. Still think they would have tested it by now though. There are usually a few physical characteristics anyways - even rarer for there to be none at all. It's fascinating! My brother has DS and his bestie has MDS and definitely has less physical markers but a few that are still pretty obvious characteristics. Difference in cognitive abilities too!"]}
