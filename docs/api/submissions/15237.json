This is by far both of our most successful relationship and we are very much in love. I can't say enough amazing things about her and want to be with her for the rest of my life. Our relationship is too the point, that we conveniently call her each husband and wife, just to make things a little simpler for people to understand. She's the one.\n\nShe's kind, beautiful, caring, supportive.... And in tremendous debt.\n\nLike the kind of debt that doesn't allow a shared financial portfolio to be used for our future. Primarily, she has student loans from a very expensive school for a Master's degree that doesn't earn. In fact she doesn't even work in her field, but that's besides the point. Between a repo'd vehicle, credit card, and her student loan debt, she's -200k with a dead-end job that pays 60k/yr \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm technically in debt too. I owe a few thousand dollars for student loans from my community college, and about 10k on my car loan. I have about 40k in savings, and trying desperately to reach the forever-moving goalposts of home-ownership.\n\nShe has 0 savings, cannot contribute to a down payment, and unfortunately can barely save a cent due to the debt.\n\nI'm worried about marrying someone who is so far away from being financially stable as I am. (Not that I am exactly stable, but MUCH closer to our goals.)\n\nObviously, spouses don't take on previous debt personally, but it will still put a strain on being able to afford our home. It's still really a single-income household with her payments, and likely will be for a over a decade. But also what if the debt somehow gets worse after we marry? I would be responsible for that. I don't have a backup plan in terms of family or friends who can support. My parents are deceased and no siblings.\n\nNot sure how to keep swerving around the idea of marriage that is certainly in our future.", "created_utc": 1681968469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12snbei/aita_for_not_wanting_to_marry_my_gf_due_to_her/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would we torpedo our financial wellness for something that we could do later when it was better for us? We are 100 percent committed, wear our commitment rings with pride, bought a house, had a family. \n\nI was a single mom, and I have an *extremely* rare genetic blood disorder. Basically I need an injection once a month for the rest of my life to stay alive and (mostly) healthy. It\u2019s costs $94,000 usd per injection. That\u2019s about a million a year. Every insurance would either kick me off or not cover it. So being a single mom with a lower paying job the state pays for my insurance and shot. \n\nWe were prepared to *never* be married and we were ok with that. However my condition worsened to the point where I now receive disability and Medicare. So after 7 years we are finally getting married.\n\nPeople judged us, but to us we wanted marriage to be a celebration and what was *best for us and our family*. People thought my husband just didn\u2019t want to get \u201csaddled with a sick person\u201d, but I knew that was never the case and we wanted a life together. I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of a huge financial strain just because I wanted to be married. \n\nYou should wait as long as you need and keep building your life together.

It's not easy. It's not fun, but it is possible. You have no kids and both have decent jobs.   \n\n\nBut she has a frivolous Masters (OK, student loans are predatory) but also repo'd car? And credit card debt? Does she even know how much debt she has?

You know what YOUR goals are.  What are hers?  How is she planning on sorting this debt out? What does she want beyond the debt?  What does she want beyond this dead end job? \n\nThen talk to a financial advisor and a careers advisor (offer to pay for both of these) and see if there is any way to sort out this debt.  Can you consolidate?  Can she get a better paying job? Then ask yourself how you would feel about being the only one in your relationship to own a home?

You're better off taking a loan from the mob.  At least they will only knee cap you. And as someone who is currently in the process of digging myself out of near crippling student loan debt, kneecapping might be less painful...", "Yeah, when my disease \u201cactivated \u201c it definitely opened my eyes to how f*cked up our healthcare system is! I\u2019m lucky I even get it, some states/hospitals refuse to even order it because they don\u2019t want to risk your payment not coming through.", "Yep, the land of the free :-D", "Greed", "Welcome to Capitalism.", "She wouldn't have been able to get the injections covered if they got married and their combined income was too much. Being a single mom with a low income meant the state would cover it. She said insurance companies found ways to not cover it. \n\nI assume once she was considered disabled her situation was covered regardless of marital status. Could be wrong, but that was my interpretation.", "We don\u2019t need the disability payments, we live a modest life and I work very part time to put money in savings for our 2 kids\u2019 futures. The disability check is small and you can\u2019t live off of it, it pretty much pays for groceries. \n\nI needed disability for the *insurance*. If we got married before I was on Medicaid, we would have had to pay out of pocket for my injections. I was already kicked off previous insurance due to my \u201cpre existing condition\u201d. Unmarried I file my taxes as single, and made so little as a preschool teacher that I qualified for state insurance. Basically they cover everything medically necessary and I pay a very small co-pay based on income. If we married his income would make me no longer eligible. We are firmly middle to lower class so we definitely couldn\u2019t afford 93,000 a month for medicine.\n\nNow that I am on disability we can get married and I won\u2019t lose my insurance due to his income. My monthly cash payment will go down, but insurance stays the same. I hope that explains it.", "> If money was never the issue, there no reason to ever get married.\n\nObviously money was the issue? Did you read the comment? A million dollars a year in medical costs.", "That piece of paper is important.  If one of them ends up in the hospital rn the other has no say in what happens to them. If they die, they have no say in funeral arrangements or inheritance or anything like that", "If her long term goal in a relationship is marriage, he indeed wasted 4 years of her life. Doesn't matter if it's just a piece of paper TO YOU. To her, it's more than that and he doesn't plan on doing it anytime soon.", "It\u2019s a waste of time because he\u2019s misleading her and stealing her time to find a partner with compatible goals.\n\nShe wants to get married and is honest about it.\n\nHe does not want to get married *and is NOT honest about it.*", "Definitely accurate under normal fiscal circumstances. But with OP\u2019s situation, maybe it\u2019s not the optimal choice. Could potentially dig her hole deeper and pull him into debt as well. \n\nShe definitely needs some serious credit counselling and professional financial advisory. \nSadly, OP will have to pay for that as well.", "As long as you marry the right person then you will be fine. And prenups are the beginning to an end of a marriage. You set your marriage up to fail by getting a prenup. Good luck though!", "Absolutely bonkers. \ud83d\ude2d \"Oh, you wanna stay alive? Mmkay, that'll be a million dollars a year. What's that, you don't have a million dollars or even a tiny fraction of that amount? That doesn't sound like my problem. What? No! Of course theres no resources or insurance available! Who tf would wanna pay a million dollars every single year LOL?! Anyway seeya around byeee\"\n\nAmerica terrifies me \ud83d\ude16 Im grateful \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 but I'm glad you FINALLY got the proper help you needed cuz that's absolutely batshit insane"]}
