This is by far both of our most successful relationship and we are very much in love. I can't say enough amazing things about her and want to be with her for the rest of my life. Our relationship is too the point, that we conveniently call her each husband and wife, just to make things a little simpler for people to understand. She's the one.\n\nShe's kind, beautiful, caring, supportive.... And in tremendous debt.\n\nLike the kind of debt that doesn't allow a shared financial portfolio to be used for our future. Primarily, she has student loans from a very expensive school for a Master's degree that doesn't earn. In fact she doesn't even work in her field, but that's besides the point. Between a repo'd vehicle, credit card, and her student loan debt, she's -200k with a dead-end job that pays 60k/yr \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm technically in debt too. I owe a few thousand dollars for student loans from my community college, and about 10k on my car loan. I have about 40k in savings, and trying desperately to reach the forever-moving goalposts of home-ownership.\n\nShe has 0 savings, cannot contribute to a down payment, and unfortunately can barely save a cent due to the debt.\n\nI'm worried about marrying someone who is so far away from being financially stable as I am. (Not that I am exactly stable, but MUCH closer to our goals.)\n\nObviously, spouses don't take on previous debt personally, but it will still put a strain on being able to afford our home. It's still really a single-income household with her payments, and likely will be for a over a decade. But also what if the debt somehow gets worse after we marry? I would be responsible for that. I don't have a backup plan in terms of family or friends who can support. My parents are deceased and no siblings.\n\nNot sure how to keep swerving around the idea of marriage that is certainly in our future.", "created_utc": 1681968469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12snbei/aita_for_not_wanting_to_marry_my_gf_due_to_her/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would we torpedo our financial wellness for something that we could do later when it was better for us? We are 100 percent committed, wear our commitment rings with pride, bought a house, had a family. \n\nI was a single mom, and I have an *extremely* rare genetic blood disorder. Basically I need an injection once a month for the rest of my life to stay alive and (mostly) healthy. It\u2019s costs $94,000 usd per injection. That\u2019s about a million a year. Every insurance would either kick me off or not cover it. So being a single mom with a lower paying job the state pays for my insurance and shot. \n\nWe were prepared to *never* be married and we were ok with that. However my condition worsened to the point where I now receive disability and Medicare. So after 7 years we are finally getting married.\n\nPeople judged us, but to us we wanted marriage to be a celebration and what was *best for us and our family*. People thought my husband just didn\u2019t want to get \u201csaddled with a sick person\u201d, but I knew that was never the case and we wanted a life together. I didn\u2019t want to be the cause of a huge financial strain just because I wanted to be married. \n\nYou should wait as long as you need and keep building your life together.

It's not easy. It's not fun, but it is possible. You have no kids and both have decent jobs.   \n\n\nBut she has a frivolous Masters (OK, student loans are predatory) but also repo'd car? And credit card debt? Does she even know how much debt she has?

You know what YOUR goals are.  What are hers?  How is she planning on sorting this debt out? What does she want beyond the debt?  What does she want beyond this dead end job? \n\nThen talk to a financial advisor and a careers advisor (offer to pay for both of these) and see if there is any way to sort out this debt.  Can you consolidate?  Can she get a better paying job? Then ask yourself how you would feel about being the only one in your relationship to own a home?

Queer people spent decades fighting for marriage equality for a reason-- because there is no easy contractual replacement for all the things marriage provides, or they would have been using that as a stopgap. Once you add in children and a homophobic family to the mix, anything you did that seems clear-cut can often not be so.", "I understand that. But that's not the situation described above. I just made these suggestions as a compromise while the girlfriend gains some financial literacy.", "I realize that \"homophobic family\" doesn't apply here, but my point is that if your family doesn't accept your non-marriage relationship as an equivilant to marriage-- like in the cases of homolhobic family--then they can really fuck up thos plans you've laid out contractually. \n\nMy point here is that your comment started with \"I don't think people understand... there are ways around\" so I wanted to point out that what you're saying that you think people don't understand isn't fully correct. Contracts are not an adequate replacement for marriage. There are some things that you can work around to some degree, but not all. Yes, OP can offer those things as a stopgap, but they don't offer comparable \"security without tying yourself to someone forever\" to marriage. It's not that people don't understand what you're suggesting, it's that those things aren't comparable. \n\nHeck, queer people used to adult-adopt their partners, and that's a whole lot more permenant than a marriage.", "Once again, none of this is the situation at hand. I said I don't think many people understand because I've met people in my life who simply don't know these things are options. OP said they did not want to marry their girlfriend, these are alternate solutions. I never said that they were an equivalent."]}
