We went to HS/school (except Ella who went to a private school and is older) together and Lina and her friends had the 'habit' Of picking a random girl from school and beating her up after school in the park. One day Susan was chosen for that and Lina beated her up, not to mention the amount of times Lina and her group of friends fatshamed her to the point that Susan became depressed, had a TCA, and became more quiet and insecure until to this day. (When we were 13 Lina even made a fake fb account pretending to be a boy and then made Susan send her pics wich she send to others from the school)\n\nSusan always kept things that happened at school as a secret and asked me not to tell her parents so when I complained about Lina our family just said that it's immature to resent something that happened when I was a teenager because they didn't knew what REALLY happened but Susan didn't wanted to talk about it. Susan stopped going to family gatherings and now basically lives in my house because Lina is at her parents' house all the time. When Ella announced that she was getting married I made the mistake of telling Susan about it and those words broke her, she became even more depressed, it reached the point I became really worried for her life so i tought that the best was saying the truth because she always told me that her breaking point would be seeing all the family happy with Lina in the wedding.\nOne day Ella approached me really excited for the wedding saying that it's the first time there's a same-sex wedding in the family and she's happy that the whole family is going.\n A few days before the wedding my aunts and grandmother were gathered together and I decided to tell them the whole truth, everything Lina had done in HS, with proofs and everything. They all became horrified, my aunt, mother of Ella and Susan, started to cry. Soon everything became a chaos and all the family knew about it, I convinced my family to not go to the wedding to show susana our support.\nSo almost all the family declined going to the wedding at last minute, the only family there was Ella's father and two cousin's. Approximately 15 people in a huge place.\n\nSusan is feeling better now that the truth was said because she really needed to talk about it and everyone is showing her the support she needed but I have been receiving messages from Ella after she found out I was the one who talked telling me all kind of things and that because of me our grandmother will now never accept a same-sex couple into the family and that Lina is really sad after I opened my mouth and that I shouldn't have ruined her wedding when she didn't even knew what happened during that time and justified her wife behavior.\n\nNow I'm feeling that maybe I was really an AH by ruining my cousin wedding when she didn't knew about what happened. \n\nPd-i'm sorry if I write something wrong, English is not my first language. I had to leave out some data because I exceeded the word limit\n\nEdit: I didn't talk to Ella about everything that happened during HS before telling the family because I knew she wouldn't care and in fact, she still doesn't care about what her wife did to her sister", "created_utc": 1701132564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185j3rd/aita_for_ruining_my_cousin_samesex_wedding/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least if you\u2019d done something earlier, you wouldn\u2019t have completely demolished everything your other cousin worked so hard to put together. Weddings are hard to plan, and expensive as hell, and you waiting so long delivered as much damage to your cousin as you could muster.", "OMFG", "Why do you tell your cousin first before you told the whole family. That's why this is fake. You don't tell the person you know but you tell your entire family. The bullying is horrible but wanting you talk to the people involved first instead of everyone else", "Yta for the timing. Doing it at the last minute sounds like you were trying to create drama.", "YTA:  Not for telling them what happened in the past but convincing everyone not to go to the wedding.  This should have been a discussion where Ella and Lina were present so she could at least defend herself or prove she changed.  \n\nPlus the main person I feel bad for here is Ella, whats the point of helping one cousin just to hurt the other.", "YTA for not talking to Ella first about what Lina did and instead making a huge family drama of it. \n\nNone of it should have anything to do with the relationship being same-sex, by the way.", "First of all, I don't believe you. I don't believe that you managed to convince everyone not to attend because of bullying that happened years ago. \n\nIf your story is true, it's unfortunate, but people can change. Instead in your story, you decide its a good idea to try and alienate everyone to avoid one person being sad. \n\nIt's bullshit, plain and simple. And if you knew about this the entire time why would you wait until now to bring it up?\n\nYou and anyone you convinced to avoid the wedding are giant assholes  and none of you would be involved in any aspect of my life ever again.\n\nYTA", "ESH\n\nWhy didnt you tell your cousin the truth prior?", "YTA", "NTA\n\nI get speaking up when you did because you, evidently, wanted to protect Susan. Not your fault there and honestly Lina deserves it.", "Sorry if the same-sex part sounds weird, for me is also irrelevant but Ella was always talking about how important the same-sex wedding was so I tought it was something relevante to add \ud83d\ude2a", "I'm 21, Susan is 23 and Ella is 27.\n\nI'm not really sure about how old is Lina because she recursed too many times and it's confusing to calculate (in a moment she was even my classmate until she dropped the school) but I think she's maybe 25-27", "I wasn't going to do anything at first because Susan didn't wanted to talk about her traumas but her mental health was getting worse, it was a difficult situation but it was a 'now or never' moment because I was afraid that Susan might do 'something' in/after the wedding.\n\nI know I should have spoken up sooner, but it was a very delicate situation.", "You could also look at it as petty revenge.", "I didn't understood your comment. But I talked with my family because I knew Ella wouldn't care about what her wife did (and she didn't care)", " I admit that the timing was bad but it was a now or never moment because I was afraid that Susan might do 'something' in/after the wedding.", "I did tell them...i put it in the post.\nIt's true that I did bad in hurting Ella but she's still trying to justify her wife behavior and says that Lina changed but she's not going to say sorry so I don't think Lina changed at all because she always ignored Susan existence", "Ella doesn't care about what happened to Susan.\nAt least for Ella, a same-sex wedding in our family was a really big deal", "You are correct. People can change. But nowhere in this story does it say Lina apologized for her actions. Which says to me, she has not changed. OP went overboard big time, but it seems that the other guests decided on their own. You can choose not to attend a wedding for any reason.", "It didn't happened too many years ago, I had to remove some data because it exceded the character limit, but this all happened six/seven years ago.\n\nI don't know how Is your family but mine is actually close and we all saw how much Susana suffered at that time even if she didn't liked to talk about it so it wasn't a surprise that nobody went to the wedding.\nI don't think Lina changed because she never said sorry and acted like if nothing happened ignoring Susana existence.", "She said that she knew her cousin would care and in fact when the truth was exposed she didn\u2019t care \u2026", "Good for you.  Stay on top of that now and make sure her family is aware of your concerns.  Go research suicide prevention and get her as much help as you can without stressing her out yourself.", "Unfortunately I don\u2019t think it stops the fact that your timing makes you an AH.  You either should have ignored Susan earlier and broke the news before the wedding plans were set in stone, or you wait until after the wedding to let members of your family know individually. Hosting a family meeting to sabotage your cousins wedding by \u2018convincing\u2019 your family to abandon her on special day when it was too late for Ella to save herself or her wedding was devious and wrong. A few days beforehand is outrageous. You\u2019re in the right for defending Susan, and I congratulate your grit in helping her see a bit of justice, but you really sacrificed your other cousin because you dragged your feet", "I don't see it as a revenge because first of all I wasn't the one being bullied. I was friend with both sisters before this.\nI just did what I think was correct in a hard moment because I was afraid that something worse could happen and as I said in the post, Susan said that her 'breaking point' would have been seeing the family at the wedding, that's the main reason we all didn't went, to take care of her", "[removed]", "1- I didn't ignored Susan at first because I never knew that the wedding thing was going to broke her that bad and I respected her wishes at that moment. \n\n2-As I said in my post and in the comments, Susan made it clear to me what was going to happen if the family went to the wedding.\nI don't know if you had to live with a person with mental health issues but with 'breaking point' Susan was meaning to off herself if the wedding happened.\n\n3-I never hosted a family meeting, I don't know what make you think that, again, as I said in the post, only my aunts and granmother where gathered because they do that.\n\n4- I said the truth in that moment because like I said in the post (again) and comments, it was a 'now or never' moment and it was a clearly difficult thing to do.\n\n5- About Elle saving herself I don't know what you're trying to say but Elle said that she doesn't care about what her wife did and said that her wife doesn't have anything to do with all of this.\n\nIt was a stressful time to me too because from one side I had Elle getting married and in the other side I had Susan doing comments about kword herself if the wedding happened", "Revenge is sometimes necessary.  You stopped a bully from getting into the family by telling the truth.  Maybe you should have spoken up earlier, sure, but that would have been a really difficult conversation and would have taken time to psyche yourself up for.  Now don't let yourself be bullied online over this.  There's a block feature.  Go use it for the nastier people.  Toss them out of your life too.  Nta.", "It still revenge, if someone bullied my family I\u2019d become their evil stepmom and bully them into not having a daddy. I do not play about my cousins or god child. \n\nOne of my moms \u2018friends\u2019 talked shit about her, I was 16 and friends with her son and knew she was cheating.  I hosted a dinner party a night(loved to cook so it wasn\u2019t uncommon for for me) both bfs since they were family friends. She was working the night shift and popping by for a plate  before work. I gave her an empty to go plate with a note that said don\u2019t play with my mom.", "Yet you\u2019re here commenting. You clearly give many shits.", "[deleted]", "I think you did good. There is NO good way to bring up something like this at ANY time when you are put in your position. What are you supposed to do when the victim refuses to say anything, and has sworn you to secrecy? Sure, some people say that you should've said something sooner. \n\nBut to who? And what if Susan saw this as a betrayal of your trust? \n\nIt's a terrible, terrible situation. I'm glad it turned out with Susan getting the proper support she needed and with her accepting it.\n\nI know that terror, OP. When you suddenly filled with that icy gut wrenching fear that you will lose someone like that.\n\nNTA. You were thrust into a really horrible position. I'm glad you spoke up", "You can\u2019t just drop this juicy bite and not tell us the fall out! What happened??", "And you're a liar. Provide evidance or shut up."]}
