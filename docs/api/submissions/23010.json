I am getting married in a few months and there's literally one week before then they will all be in town, and my brothers agreed that we could have a family dinner and they'd both come and be on their best behavior. The thing is that my brother Owen's only stipulation is that my brother Greg's girlfriend, Joni, doesn't come. \n\nThe reason Owen doesn't want Greg's girlfriend there is because part of the reason they haven't talked is due to Owen's wife, Tracy, being very upset with Joni still over an episode when Tracy had my youngest neice. \n\nJoni babysat for their other child, and they had apparently made arrangements that Joni would continue to do so for the newborn as well after Tracy was done with maternity leave. However there was some kind of miscommunication where Joni thought that Owen and Tracey were going to be paying her more money and Owen and Tracey thought she'd be getting the same rate. So a week before Tracey gave birth Joni literally just stopped showing up without giving them time to find anyone else. This kind of blew up into this huge fight that involved other preexisting tensions with Owen and Greg.\n\nI thought this seemed fair because Tracy is technically now part of the family while Joni isn't.  However Greg got very mad about this, because he said Joni is his family at this point, and if she can't come then Tracy shouldn't be able to either. The problem is that Owen will refuse to come if Tracy can't but Greg said he'd come anyway, so I asked him if he couldn't just take one for the team this once and now he's really mad at me. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1690189969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1585b18/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_girlfriend_not_to/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
