Labs are LITERALLY one of the most popular breeds in the US. and yet you don't see that. So are beagles. Even with pits raised from puppyhood, you still see these maulings.

And bulldogs are too inbred to live and breathe normally, lol, they can't do very much. \n\nRetrievers retrieve, pointers point, cockers flush woodcock, and pitbulls fight and kill. Genetics can never be denied. It's why we have different breeds! All dogs are not the same, especially attitude and aptitude-wise. Some are more intelligent than others. And then we have the pit, which will feel challenged by and destroy inanimate objects. Not very bright. They're also terribly bred, and have horrid skin.", "Good for you"]}
