Dog dander could effect other clients, and what if it has an accident?", "NTA. There's no such thing as \"training\" for a dog to become a \"support animal\". It's service and working dogs that go through training. Her little Foo Fee isn't either of these. Too many people abuse the ESA terms, especially when a landlord/owner bans a certain breed from their property. \n\nDon't put up with that nonsense.", "NTA.

So, yea dog can wait outside.", "NTA - also you are respecting your clients who are trusting you with their home while you show it. Not to mention what if they put the dog down and it pees or chews on something? \n\nBesides I highly doubt the dog is being trained to be a support animal which doesn\u2019t matter because if it was legitimate the dog wouldn\u2019t have been carried\u2026 unless support loaf is a thing.\n\nEdit: typo + edited for clarity.", "NTA \nYou cannot risk setting off allergies of anyone present, nor for the folks who own the home, if it's still occupied.\n\nAnd \"in training\" does not mean \"trained\". Bringing in the dog is a liability.\n\nEdit: avid dog lover and owner, so this is not an anti dog comment", "NTA. I can't believe this is even a question. I love my dogs, and take them all sorts of places, but I would never dream of taking them into a stranger's home, and you were absolutely right not to allow them to do so. If it were a vacant property, the it probably wouldn't be as big a deal, but a house someone is still living in should not be host to random animals.", "NTA. Service or support animal? Possible, yet I'm not buying it. They only offered that up as a last ditch effort. Some people are just so entitled and these are likely those people. One just has to stay outside with the dog. They could then switch off so that the other could tour the home.", "Nta", "NTA.

But CYA the Ada federal law says specifically they don\u2019t have to wear a vest (service animals) as a requirement.  I bring mine and I\u2019m prepared to show documents even tho there\u2019s no governing body that you register with. \n\nJust wanted to mention that because I don\u2019t want you to actually deny a service animal under the assumption that they aren\u2019t properly identified.  \n\nThis lady was obviously just wanting to do what she wanted.  And no that\u2019s not ok. It\u2019s people like that that make it hard for those with actual working dogs who are then denied. \n\nAlso note there\u2019s only two questions:  is this a service dog?  What task are they trained to assist you with.  (Note: cannot ask what the persons disability is tho)\n\nAnd I agree.  What if the people living there hve an allergic child or don\u2019t like dogs.  Suddenly not only do you have people trampling in your house but now a strange animal?  Nope.\n\nEdit to say that if my dog is not direcry wearing his vest (it chokes him and it overheats him in the summer) I have it clipped to the leash handle and I find someone working or otherwise in charge of the area I\u2019m Going into that\u2019s no pets and heads up this is a service animal and I wanted to let you know as it might not be not obvious.  It kills the problem before it starts. \n\nNot saying it\u2019s forced on others to do, but I try to go easiest and best understood.

It's not their house.", "NTA This home must stay in show ready condition. Dogs shed, drool, and have accidents. They leave allergens behind which can affect people. There is nothing wrong with your protecting your clients house from potential uncleanliness and damage.

It\u2019s to most pointless ignorant comment when people expect something to be okay just because another person allowed it. One person allowing something doesn\u2019t mean everyone automatically has to follow the same thing.", "NTA. I believe different places have different rules for medical support animals as opposed to emotional support animals so you might want to look up what the rules are and even print them out to have them handy. Dogs in training usually are required to wear vests or harnesses that indicate their status. \n\nI would feel the same way. I'm not sure if you were showing a new property or an existing home, but damage could happen to either. You are correct that someone might have an allergic reaction or could be bitten.", "NTA you don\u2019t know if the sellers have allergies to dogs for a start.", "NTA, Even if it was a service animal, I still would not let them in.

I'm anaphylactic to dogs and while I understand real service animals are necessary and just try to avoid them I am so sick of entitled assholes bringing their dogs everywhere and claiming they are service animals, especially those ones who are carrying their small dog in their arms or putting them in a cart \ud83d\ude44.\n\nIt's why I really think there should be an official registration for trained services animals. An ID for them wouldn't have to say anything about your medical information, just show that they are a registered service animal belonging to a specific person. It would really help to stop all the problems with liars", "From another perspective, as someone with severe allergies, if you were showing my home and let an animal inside I would be furious. Entitled assholes need to learn that not everyone wants to be around their pet. You did the right thing.", "I\u2019ve also relocated when i have been somewhere where there was an allergic person although it\u2019s the managements job to attempt to accommodate or not deny access. \n\nI will move or change to a corner away from an allergic person or family or do what I can to make it work.  Not scream and yell about my rights.  \n\nYou can ask for accomodation as a person with a severe allergy.  In a way that isn\u2019t remove this dog I was here first.  They can\u2019t legally do rhar if the dog is behaved they can only remove a service dog if it\u2019s barking or uncontrolled or running around or dedicating or otherwise causing a disruption and the handler cannot bring that dog to control. \n\nYet random dogs running through the supermarket dirty on a rope not leash and bo one holding it dog eating off shelves have occurred and they weren\u2019t removed.  So your results may vary. \n\nI want to believe most people would try to ask in a way that doesn\u2019t complain but helps everyone ala is there a way I could move to the other side of the room due to allergies?\n\nAlso know that real service dogs are checked by handlers for cleanliness and attitude.  If my dog is somehow muddy we don\u2019t go or at least til he\u2019s been properly addressed.  If he\u2019s tired or irritable or some such we don\u2019t go.  If he\u2019s coughing or sneezing we don\u2019t go. \n\nI understand allergies and that my dog being clean non shedding and all may not be enough for some people who are sensitive.  \n\nI just wanted to state that service dogs who are actual working dogs are checked more like a bike before you go for a ride before we go into a public space indoors or where ever pets aren\u2019t allowed.  \n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to anyone\u2019s medical issues having dozens myself.  And as such i would hope others would be graceful in trying to make space for everyone."]}
