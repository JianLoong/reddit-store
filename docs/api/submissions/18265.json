You're going above and beyond. \ud83d\ude0f", "Maybe true in some places, but where I live, once a house is on the market, especially if there is an open house, it\u2019s considered open to the public & service animals have to be allowed.", "I\u2019m not talking about the US. Canada.", "Or Australian government. Unless it\u2019s an authentic service dog, trained and has to wear a specific vest while working public spaces, any other animal is a pet and isn\u2019t a protected and can be denied entry.", "Well I dont know who regulates it, I had assumed the government regulated service animals, because if you are blind for example you would need disability help, check, and a possible service dog.", "It's the same in the US.", "Bloody hell, I was getting downvoted into oblivion because of something I thought was true. People really are sensitive on here.", "My friends cat yowls his head off when she is asleep and her blood sugar drops too low", "Dogs can smell a *lot* on someone's breath, but when they are trained to do it, it is usually for diabetes alerts. These are often smaller dogs, too.\n\nMy golden started reacting to my mental health almost as soon as we adopted her. We saw what she was doing, trained her, reinforced her clear desire to look after me, added some training specific to my behaviour, and now I have a fully trained service dog!", "In Aus, an ESA is not recognised. Only service animals are protected.", "Why would I do that? It\u2019s someone else\u2019s private home. Don\u2019t bring your pet. \n\nHave some respect for other peoples property.", "I think that there wasn't a sign or warning beforehanded that all visitors should be clothed all the time, but I'll take a wild guess that there wasn't anyone running around in their SpoongeBob boxers.", "Maybe we\u2019re misunderstanding weights. I can carry (and have carried my 30ish kg, which is 70lbs) dog many times. She\u2019s also torn both her acl, and I\u2019ve had to carry her home over 2kms when she tore it on a run and I had no other way to get her home. \n\nFar out, a bar alone at the gym is 20kgs. It\u2019s not much weight. 30kgs is barely a warm up weight. \n\nWe have multiple offers anyway, and it was out of their price range which they said so.  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so angry.", "Ah, I believe then it's province specific but alternate accommodation is a possibility, though not always, right?", "Yeah and the training isn\u2019t easy. We have a program for training service dogs at my college and these dogs are trained from a very young age and work at it every single day. They EARN that vest and those badges.", "Nope. The ADA only says the dog must be trained in tasks to mitigate your disability, must not be disruptive in public, & that establishments can only ask 2 questions in regards to service animals. There are no special licensing requirements, the dog can be self-trained, & does not need a vest or even a leash if wearing one will impede its task(s).", "In America yes to the check but the help (including dogs) are basically always paid for out of pocket. Sometimes insurance will pay but not always.", "People aren't sensitive, you were just spreading misinformation.", "People aren't sensitive you're just an idiot spreading falsehoods lmao", "[deleted]", "Sure for a scheduled showing. \n\nBut once it\u2019s an open house the realtor can ask them if other accommodations can be made & if they\u2019d like to schedule a showing but they can\u2019t deny them entry.", "Thats fair, but I was asking questions and trying to learn.", "In my 10+ years in real estate. I\u2019ve never had to spell out - don\u2019t bring your pet to an open home. \n\nIt\u2019s not your home. It\u2019s not your furniture, it\u2019s not you who has to clean up after everyone has left. \n\nIt is disrespectful af to bring your pet to someone else\u2019s home without permission.", "Again, I don't know where you live, but those questions can be answered with a quick Google search.
