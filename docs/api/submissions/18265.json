As you said, you don\u2019t know if someone in the home is severely allergic. Not to mention if they put the dog down, it makes a mess or gets injured. \n\nOh and some home owners still use those carpet powders to make the house smell good. Could be toxic to the puppy if they didn\u2019t use a pet safe one. \n\nIt\u2019s so annoying when people try to pass their obviously not a service or support dog off as one (bc as you said, there is paperwork/vests they HAVE to carry to support the claim) It takes away from people who actually need support.", "INFO: what is your work policy on this??? Hey, this isn\u2019t an asshole/social question, it should be a professional/policy question. You\u2019ve been left in the care of someone\u2019s home for which you presumably have some legal and professional responsibility. Somebody wants to put an animal in the home. The answer is no. Presumably at some point you had training or licensure that emphasised your duty. Presumably if you mess up (let burglars into the home, let their pet outside, allow children to drown in the pool, misrepresent the property) you are fully aware of the legal/professional consequences. This is a thing like that. This is not a social thing like \u201cbeing a jerk and getting judged for it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m surprised that you and your colleagues don\u2019t have a clear instant answer that goes like \u201cwe do not allow animals inside our client\u2019s homes.\u201d Why are you letting this be a question of personal opinions? But since you don\u2019t, it\u2019s time to write up a set of work policies that includes just that. You should not be making off the cuff decisions about this. It should be something that people see on your website in an FAQ or something. \n\nIf you do decide that you want to facilitate allowing people to bring animals into clients\u2019 properties, then write in your policy that you will ONLY DO THIS WITH PERMISSION OF THE HOMEOWNER AND/OR TENANT. And then get that permission from the people living in that property. When they ask you to sell their property, you ask them: \u201care you okay with people bringing their animals onto the property?\u201d Hopefully saying this question out loud will help you realize what a stupid situation this is to begin with. And you mark a box if they opt in. You are the keeper of their home\u2019s boundaries and they have rights to those boundaries. \n\nOkay? I know I sound ticked off at you but I do think this is a good place to cover your ass. Also, this is the kind of thing that makes a potential seller wonder what precisely the job of real estate agent entails, if you can\u2019t show good judgment in a mildly awkward situation involving MY PROPERTY, and why we should entrust you with our properties, if you can\u2019t tell the difference between an awkward social situation and a breach of your duties to me. As a seller I\u2019d WANT you to be a bit of a jerk to enforce my home\u2019s boundaries to others. After all, the vulnerability is all on me (the seller) - I\u2019m letting strangers into my house guarded by a professional who I\u2019m trusting with this job, and THEY are not risking anything. \n\nCover your ass and step up to your duty.", "They would have put the dog on the floor and let it run through the house no matter what you said.", "The restrictions aren\u2019t exactly arbitrary though.

I have T1 diabetes and trained my dog to alert me to a low blood sugar.  If you Google it, you will find steps on how to do that.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a part that many people are ignorant on when it comes to service animals.  Some service animals do go through an intensive training.  But that is why dogs like that cost 5-figures and are prohibitively expensive.  However, people are allowed to do their own training so a dog can help them with their medical issues.  And those dogs are still legally considered service animals.  This is for the US, I can't speak for other countries.\n\nService animals don't have to wear vests or have badges or whatever else the OP very mistakenly assuming.  You also can't look at a dog and tell if it is a service animal or not.  That's a ridiculous assumption.  Or look at a person and tell if they need a service animal or not.  There are a lot of invisible disabilities, like diabetes, where service animals can be helpful.\n\nHowever, there are two questions that can be asked.  (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform.\n\nWith all that said, I'm assuming the only thing the OP was correct about was they don't have to let a service animal into a person's private home, even if it was open for showings.

The Media and news changes it and makes it sound like it was a Pitty breed. I\u2019ve literally read an article where the title said \u2018Pitbull\u2019 and it turned out to be a different large breed of dog that was nowhere near having pitbull in their blood later in the same article. I\u2019m not saying Pitbulls haven\u2019t attacked, they\u2019re just the most easy to pick apart.\n\nPit bulls are beautiful dogs, and they were never originally bred for bloodsport. They were Nanny dogs first and foremost, bred to look after children. But because of the way they look, people took advantage and started to use them for bad things. I\u2019m sorry you lost the love for the breed you claimed to have played with, loved and worked with. I don\u2019t believe you honestly that you\u2019ve worked, played or anything with the breed. But I digress. Hate the irresponsible owners. Never the dogs, especially those who are innocent. But you just clump them all together. Black and white is what you see. The most docile of dog breeds, can easily turn on their owner if they\u2019re treated badly by them behind closed doors."]}
