They were giving me dirty looks and whispering, so I looked up from my phone and asked what the problem was. The lady said \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, could you move to another spot to smoke?\u201d (Also I couldnt tell she was pregnant, she wasn\u2019t showing) I replied and said \u201csorry but this is the designated area, it says so on the sign and there\u2019s ashtrays here as well. there are some other spots you could sit where smoking isn\u2019t allowed\u201d, the lady rolled her eyes and said I was a \u2018despicable person\u2019.

Very simple.\n\nAs for the interaction, you were polite, informed them of accurate information they were perhaps unaware of, and offered solutions. No one can fault you on any count.", "NTA. Designated spot is purposely ( *checks notes* ) DESIGNATED", "NTA.  You were in the designated spot.  You were there first.  You pointed out the designation for the area and even mentioned there's other areas they could go that weren't smoking areas.  \n\nI'm asthmatic and cigarette smoke is a major trigger for me, but I don't go up to someone smoking in a designated area and make them out to be a jerk for it.", "NTA, she probably did it just to have an argument.  Smoking areas are generally kind of gross, no one goes there just to sit.  Someone was in the mood to be offended.", "NTA, there are other spaces she could move to, but you can\u2019t smoke outside the designated area.", "NTA. You were in an area designated for smoking. We have so many areas where us non smokers can go. Just cause you\u2019re pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you get special treatment.", "NTA.  Her being pregnant doesn\u2019t make a difference here, you were in a designated smoking area and are not responsible for her or her unborn child\u2019s health.", "NTA. You were clearly in a designated smoking area, were there first, and were polite. Totally fine all around", "NTA, as much as I truly hate smoking, you were 100% in your right.", "NTA. You were there first and are smacking where it\u2019s allowed. They shouldn\u2019t have sat there seeing you smoke.", "NTA\n\nThe sign was clearly there. She just thinks that since she is pregnant, she is privileged to do anything. She is TA", "nta, you were in the designated smoking spot. the lady could have moved elsewhere", "NTA. It's not your fault she can't comprehend signs. Seems like she did that on purpose.", "NTA - you were literally doing what the area was designated for, a pregnant woman had no business being there in the first place.\n\nIt's like being in a swimming pool and someone complaining that they are getting wet.", "NTA. I hate cigarette smoke, and my wife and kid have asthma. I don\u2019t like to be around it, and hate it when people smoke in crowded areas. \n\nBUT, it\u2019s your right to smoke on your break, and you were doing it in the designated area. I really appreciate you for being considerate to others and smoking in the right place.", "NTA You were there first. It was the designated area, which you politely informed them of. They started judging you for smoking near a pregnant individual before you even knew that she was pregnant. They had other choices, you did not and it is an act of entitlement to assume strangers must bend over backwards because your pregnant.", "NTA. there really are so few spots left to smoke even outdoors. And she decides to sit at one where somebody is already smoking and ask them to leave?  She\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s absolutely the smokers job to make sure they\u2019re not bothering anybody. But especially when you\u2019re given a small area to accomplish just that you are allowed to use it.", "NTA. You were in the designated area and there first\u2026", "NTA.\n\nIf it\u2019s the only designated smoking area, then what choice do you even have? Not to mention, if the sequence of events is to be believed, they came to the area after you while you were (I presume) already smoking. They knew what they were *literally* walking into.", "NTA - it's a designated smoking area, which would indicate to me that there are plenty of areas where smoking isn't allowed where they could've sat. It reminds me of this person that moved into a house next to my local pub and then started a petition to lessen the opening hours due to noise. \n\nIt sounds entitled and almost like they wanted an argument or something, especially since you were there first.", "NTA, you were in the designated spot she should have moved. If you weren\u2019t in the designated spot then you would be TA", "NTA.  You were in a designated smoking area and they chose to sit there (possibly even after seeing you currently smoking).  To make an outdated comparison, that'd be like asking to be seated in the Smoking Section at a restaurant and then complaining to the people next to you about their smoking.  Being pregnant isn't a free pass to get whatever you want.", "NTA, if you couldn't tell, and they sat in the area after you clearly marked that's on them. Not like you purposely lit up next to a pregnant woman in a non-designated smoking area.", "NTA some pregnant people think they are bearing a gift for the world. It\u2019s nice when people give them the courtesy. That\u2019s all it is though. They could have easily walked away from the beginning.", "NTA\n\nI have two kids myself, so i went to two pregnancies. In both i couldn't stand the smell of tobacco, i always saw that i avoided anything smoking-related. Myself. If she was oh so pregnant, she could just used any other bench. Especially if there were signs saying this area where you sat is for smoking...", "ESH. \n\nThem for being entitled and asking you to move from the literal smoking area to accommodate them. You for feeding Big Tobacco.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
