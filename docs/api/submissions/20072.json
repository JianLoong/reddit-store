Next question pls", "NTA - I really, really like my neighbors and I wouldn\u2019t drive them to the airport, regardless of what time of day it is. Your neighbors asking was very presumptuous  of them. That is way over the line-certainly not a cup of sugar favor.", "NTA, I totally agree with you. It\u2019s weird to ask that of your neighbour thar you don\u2019t know very well.", "NTA.\n\nA 5am flight means you would have to be at the airport anywhere from one hour to two hours before to factor check-in, security etc.  So you would have to leave latest about 3:30, if not earlier.  Which means being up before three to be ready to go.\n\nThat would be a major imposition, even for close family.", "5 AM flight means being at the airport by 3-3:30. Leaving at 230ish. That\u2019s a a big ask. I even grumble (quietly) when I need to drive my wife for an early flight. NTA", "YTA. Not for refusing to drive them, but because I suspect your delivery wasn't very polite. \n\nIt reads like they asked you and you said \"No. Call a taxi.\". Or if you \"acted shocked\" maybe you said something more like \"Are you crazy!? No! Call a taxi!\" Which would explain why they've dialed back the friendly terms of the relationship.\n\nIf these are neighbors that you were on good terms with, a more appropriate response would be \"Sorry, that's a little early for me and doesn't work with my schedule. It would be better to ask someone else or call a taxi.\"\n\nI think that asking someone to drive you to an airport 40 mins away before 5am is a bit much for a favor, but declining requests politely is generally expected to maintain friendly relationships in life.", "Yes, it seemed to me like they were treating me as a free taxi. But, maybe they thought we were better friends than what I consider them?", "5am flight you have to leave 3:30 the latest to check-in and get through airport security. Screw that I'm not waking up for almost anyone that early. Park at the airport as you will need to come back. There is off airport parking also that's cheaper. Uber isn't that expensive either.", "If it\u2019s a 5 am flight and a 40 minute round trip, op would have to get up way earlier than 4:20 am. Leaving time for security, they would probably have to be at the airport by 4 at the very latest. That means *leaving* home by 3:20, and probably getting up by 2:30 or 2:45?\n\nBy the way, why are they planning a vacation when they can\u2019t afford a cab to the airport???", "Depends on your airport and where you are going. When my sister went to Spain, the time choices really sucked for both leaving and arriving at our airport.", "I wouldn't say they're pissed at me. Just kind of put off.\n\nI'm certainly not going to lose any sleep if they never talk to me again, but I'm just wondering if it was a reasonable ask, especially if it wasn't middle-of-the-night.", "This is ridiculous, I would be shocked too if my neighbor asked me to get up at three in the morning to take them to the airport. They\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re neighbors. (Though neighbors can be friends). I assume OP was shocked given THEY (the neighbor) was shocked that they\u2019d say no.\n\nFurthermore if you take them, they\u2019ll probably turn around and ask you to pick them up. \u201cFavors\u201d like these don\u2019t end at one time\u2026\n\nNTA", "Yes, my reaction might have been very direct. I suppose I wanted to shut down any further asks related to this, but I was also genuinely shocked they would ask for a flight in the middle of the night. That's why I'm asking if IATA.", "That's fair. I was very direct (which wasn't polite), but I didn't call them crazy or anything like that.\n\nI think the reason I was so direct is that I didn't want them to ask anything else. If I said, \"5am doesn't work for me\", what if they said, \"we're coming home on an afternoon flight, can you pick us up?\"\n\nI didn't want to drive them at all. Like I said, the middle-of-the-night was a shocker, but I still would have said no if it was another time.", "You \u201csuspect\u201d \nand \u201cmaybe you said\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s code for speculative bullshit. Judging by the info presented and not that which you made up\u2026 OP is in no way TA.", "Have they ever done that level of a favor for you, which would reasonably lead them to believe that they were better friends?", "More favors was part of my worry. The middle-of-the-night was clearly a non-starter for me, but like I said, I still would have said no to a daytime flight. We're friendly, but not what I would consider friends.\n\nI'm not sure if they got a drive from someone else or not.", "IMO responding that way just escalated a situation that really didn't need any escalating. Yeah, it's kinda a big ask - but maybe they are coming from a place of misunderstanding the closeness of your friendship, not a place of entitlement? Responding, politely, that you wouldn't be able to spend an hour and a half traveling to/from the airport in the early morning before work would have been 1. True and 2. Maintained a positive rapport with your neighbors. If these requests keep rolling in from your neighbors - sure, start getting snippy about it. I just don't think it's at the point where you needed to handle the request this way and create tension for no reason. Obviously, there are many other people here who disagree with my assessment. :) *shrug*", "Yes and that's fine too. I find \"Sorry, that doesn't work for me/with my schedule.\" is my go-to decline phrase. If my schedule is that I plan to be playing video games and drinking margaritas, well, they don't need to know that.", "No, but I've never asked for any favors from them. Didn't ever have the need to. I've done them minor favors in the past, but nothing on this level.", "I disagree there is nothing wrong with being direct, it leaves no room for misinterpretation or like OP said other favours that could be asked.", "NTA, but if it were at a more reasonable time, it would be nice of you to take them (although they should fill up your gas tank). \n\nI wouldn't even drive my husband to the airport for a 5 AM flight. I would be so sleepy, it wouldn't be safe. I sure wouldn't ask a neighbour to drive me at that time!\n\nDoes you airport not have park 'n' fly or a relatively inexpensive limo service?", "NTA,if they can afford a holiday,they can pay for a taxi.", "NTA - the one time I asked a neighbor for a favor like this, I did so by saying that I knew it was huge, my planned ride fell through, and I'd understand if they said no cuz it was a BIG ask. They said no, and I understood. I was not shocked that they couldn't/wouldn't get up at 3am. I struggled to get transport but I managed it (where I live is hard to get taxis or ubers. I had to walk three long blocks at 3am hauling luggage to get to a place I could get a pick up). Not fun, but I sucked it up and did it.", "NTA\n\nYou are right. They should have factored in transportation when it came to planning. It's not even you responsibility. \n\nIt doesn't even sound like you are at the level of friendship where airport drop off/pick up is something you would do. 5am flight or not.", "NTA, they have ride share vans that are cheaper than taxis. And agree, they need to budget for transportation.", "NTA - they should have factored in getting to the airport at the time of booking flight\u2019s etc.  you are definitely under no obligation to be a taxi service to save them money, especially at that time of the morning.  I suppose they also expected you to just pick them up when they got back as well.", "They are probably avoiding you because they realized their request was ridiculous and are embarrassed when they see you.  I hope this blows over as time goes on.  It could also be the way you said \"no\".  Was it rude, firm, how dare you ask such a thing no?", "Definitely NTA. I won\u2019t drive my mom and stepdad to the airport and it\u2019s only 30 minutes away. I have the same idea as you that transport to and from should be factored into the total budget.", "Hell no. Most definitely n.t.a.", "NTA, It's your neighbors sole responsibility to account for traveling details. It has nothing to do with you. They need to learn how to plan better, and they need to learn how to plan smarter. Just as I told the poster who declined to watch a neighbor's husband with cancer, your time is yours alone to choose what to do with it. You asserted a boundary when you declined to drive them to an airport, especially at a ghastly hour. They asked an audacious ask and they rightfully got shut down in the process. No skin off your teeth, and honestly it is no loss for you to be ignored by such people.", "NTA - simply asking doesn\u2019t make them TA but rather acting like they can\u2019t believe you said no. Getting to/from the airport should have factored into their planning and budget before booking it.", "NTA.  I think you went a bit far with the call a taxi.  Just no would have been fine.", "Parking at an airport (at least in the U.S) accumulates a price over time. I picked someone up from the airport (2 - 3 hours) and it cost $30.", "That kind of as is limited to family.", "NTA - 5 am flight means you have to be there @ 3:30am at the latest. 40 minute drive (and bit of a cushion) means you're leaving @ 2:45am. You have to wake up with time to at least make a cup of coffee, now we're talking 2:30am.  And, if you have to take a shower it's going to be no later than 2:00am.\n\nSo, no.  Trust me, the best thing that could happen is that they never speak to you again because they clearly hate you.\n\nBTW, if my parents or kids asked the same thing I would say yes in a heartbeat.", "Cheeky fluffers! Asking you to do that in the middle of the night. NTA but they are for taking it so personally especially when they\u2019re in the wrong.", "NTA.   for me personally, that level of favor (getting to the airport by 4am) is for immediate family & lifelong friends. those are the only people I would even expect to ask.", "NTA. I also live 40 min from the airport, and I have come to dislike when certain relatives visit and require a ride. Often these flights are scheduled w/o prior coordination and interfere with work and/or getting kids to school. I would probably provide a ride to a neighbor if I could swing it (just depends), but a 5am flight (leaving at 2:30a!) would also garner a hard no from me.", "NTA\n\nMy airport is 45 mins away and I have a hard time even asking my husband to take me to the airport, let alone ask someone not related or married to me to take me at 5:00 am!  So weird.", "In what universe is it alright for a neighbor to ask another neighbor with whom they're someone friendly to get them to the airport 40 minutes away at 5 a.m.?\n\nNot this one.\n\nThis is one of those \"are you fucking kidding me\" situations, that's how out of line they were.\n\nNTA", "Are you kidding? Driving or picking someone up from the airport is normally someone you can command. There are very few volunteers in that business. NTA. The idea that they would ask you for a ride to a 5 am flight to me borders on insanity.", "NTA that\u2019s a big ask. I\u2019d do it for family and friends without a second thought. Not for a neighbor. I\u2019m happy to do certain favors for my neighbors (feed pets while out of town, take in mail, mow their lawn if they have an injury, babysit during a true emergency, etc.) \u2014 but that early morning ride would be out of the question.", "NTA. My husband didn\u2019t even ask me to drive him to the airport for a 5 am flight when I had to work. (I would have because he\u2019s my husband but the point stands)", "Nta. You are under no obligation to drive them or to explain why. Why do you think you aren\u2019t entitled to just saying no, as you did? No is a complete sentence. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nPeople are allowed to have their own reasons without judgement. The end. \nMaybe you say yes too much to everyone else and need a weekend at home or to sleep in. Maybe you have ocd about your car. Maybe you are a private person. Maybe you don\u2019t have the gas money in your budget this month. Maybe you don\u2019t want the next question to be can you pick them up. Maybe they smell. Maybe you smell. Whatever. No is fine. It\u2019s not an emergency, they have time to make other arrangements.", ">the airport is about 40 minutes away. It was for a 5am flight.\n\nThey're asking you to drive them to the airport for a 5am flight. Airport is 40 minutes away. Usually people need to arrive two hours before a flight so they want a ride at 2:30am? This is not a neighbor favor. NTA.\n\nI think a lot of people don't understand levels of friendship. There are acquaintances, there are English needs another word here for friends but friends you go to dinner or the movies with (I vote we steal it from another language as is custom), then friends aka ride or die friends but I'm too old to use that.", "NTA.  They were taken aback??  I wouldn\u2019t ask my own daughter (who lives next door) to drive me that early.  That\u2019s what ride share apps with generous tips are for.", "NTA. That's the sort of thing ones needs to wait for a person to volunteer for, definitely not ask them to do, unless you have the sort of relationship built up already.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even drive my husband to the airport at 5 am lol", "Plus, i would expect them to ask OP for a ride back as well.", "Their flight is at 5am. So, they need to arrive ar the airport at a minimum of 4am if domestic and 2:30-3am for international. That means, OP would have had to leave home before 2am, drive 40 minutes there, and 40 minutes back. \n\nThis isn't even a friend level favour. This is a GOOD friend or immediate family level favour. I may have added in that I couldn't because of work to keep it cute and 'neighborly', but this would have been a HARD NO for anyone other than my immediate family or super good friends.\n\nThey have some real audacity to even ask.", "Yes, it does have a park and fly. I don't know why they didn't want to do that. I didn't ask, because I really just wanted to end any possibility of me having to drive them. Continuing the discussion had me worried that they may ask me to pick them up instead.", "When we have an early flight we stay at a hotel near the airport the night before that has a stay, park & fly deal with a private lot.  For about $120 we get the night in a decent hotel room plus up to 8 days of parking.  I couldn't imagine asking someone to drive me to the airport at 3am.", "No, I consider them more acquaintances, than friends.\n\nPersonally, an airport trip of a total of 1.5 hours is something I'd only ask of immediate family or maybe very close friends.", "I don't think my response was rude, but I could understand that some people might perceive it that way. It was direct, leaving no possibility that I might change my mind.\n\nYou might be right, that they are embarrassed. However, they don't seem like the type of people that get embarrassed easily.", "I would find that a lot to ask for even from a good friend.", "If they felt close, they'd care too much about you to put you out like this just to save a few bucks. There's a reason they asked you rather than family or a close friend. They are just users.", "We\u2019re not that far from our local airport and live in a neighborhood with plentiful parking so family will park by our house and get a ride to the airport\u2026 Even our parents and siblings get to take an Uber if it\u2019s outside normal walking hours.   Asking someone to get up hours and hours before their normal waking time is a HUGE ask and should be reserved for emergencies. I can\u2019t imagine my neighbors asking me something like that unless it\u2019s like \u2018Hey I\u2019m pregnant, if I go into labor and it\u2019s progressing really fast would you stay with my other kids until <family member > gets here from an hour away?\u2019 Or they need to take a kid to the ER or something", "It's not a reasonable ask at all.", " It wasn\u2019t. We had an early flight and we stayed at a hotel the night before and used their free shuttle to the airport at 3am instead lol. My sister drove us up the night before and we went to dinner together. I wasn\u2019t going to ask her to drive us up at like 2am and she\u2019s my sister lol\n\n(Uber/cabs etc aren\u2019t super available where our house is especially super early in the morning)", "It's possible they're just embarrassed because they realize how far they overstepped. I'd just carry on like normal and give them a wave if you see them out, but like you said definitely don't lose sleep over it.", "They'll be friendly again next time they need something.", "But like it IS is the \"middle of the night\"! They'd need to arrive at the airport ~2hrs before the flight and with a 40min travel time, you'd have to leave at like 2:30/2:45am. That is not \"the morning\" to most people!! NTA.", "Being the middle of the night makes it an unreasonable ask. Middle of the day when you have don't have anything else going on? That's a reasonable ask (especially if they pay for the gas), but still one that you can reasonably decline.", "How were they planning on getting back home from the airport after their trip?  You know if you took them there, you'd be signing up for the return trip as well, right?\n\nWho knows when that would have been.  So that's two 80-minute drives with one being super early in the morning, and the second being at some mystery time on another date.  Yeah, no you're NTA.", "I fail to see how your comment has to do anything with what the commenter above you said", "They need to stop being cheap and use the airport parking. It is rude of them to inconvenience you and use your gas so they can get a free ride (and likely pickup as well). NTA", "Just as well they avoided you after you refused. It would take an awful lot of gall to ask you to pick them up on return, but if they do, don't hesitate to say no. Better yet, don't answer their call or respond to texts. \n\nIf they are inexperienced flyers and don't know about park n fly, you could point it out to them in the future if necessary.", "Right? Stay, park & fly is a great deal because you can get a hotel right across the street from the airport for a cost that is cheaper than parking at the airport (our airport anyway) and best of all you don't have to worry about highway traffic, weather, or re-checking that your house is in order for the 3rd time as you are rushing out the door. Plus, our favourite hotel gives us a hot breakfast in the morning if not too early, and if it is really early, they pack a nice light meal.", "Yeah, don't act Like you did anything wrong, or feel that you should feel like you did something wrong. By giving them a wave and acting normal/cordial as ever, will get them to see that they are the ones that have overstepped and should feel awkward.", "The original comment said that they never schedule a flight at an hour like that. The comment you replied to was responding to that part of the original comment. \n\nSometimes you don\u2019t have a choice - if you\u2019re flying out of a smaller airport into a smaller airport sometimes any flight you have to choose from are at inconvenient off-hours.", "Lol deleting your account because of downvotes, weak.", "I got that. But the commenter was talking about themselves personally. Other people's circumstances have nothing to do with them.", "They were using their sister\u2019s personal experience in booking a flight as an example.

It's okay.", "NTA. The number of people I'd drive to the airport at 3 am (for a 5 am flight) could be counted on my fingers and my neighbors aren't it. There's a big difference between lending them your chainsaw or signing for a package once and a while versus messing up your sleep/morning because they're not cheap enough to not fly out for vacation but too cheap to spend $40 on an uber.", "NTA.  My own husband doesn't even get up that early to take me to the airport.  This is what Uber and taxis are for.", "NTA - when we went on vacation my FIL offered to drive us so that we wouldn't have to leave our car in long term parking. For getting there that would have been okay but our return flight didn't get in until 1 AM. No way was I going to ask him to drive an hour (each way) in the middle of the night to pick us up. Sure, it would have saved us $60 in parking fees but I wouldn't ask anyone to do that, especially someone I barely know.\n\nI'm with you. If they can afford to go on vacation and pay for flights they can afford to leave their car in long term parking.", "Ridiculous and rude on their part! NTA", "NAH. Where\u2019s the conflict here? They asked. You said no. Both fine. You said no and they haven\u2019t asked you for anything since, also fine. They probably just thought you were on friendlier terms than you view it. Would you be the AH if it was different? Not really, but I guess that depends on what you might possibly expect from your neighbors in the future. Could you see yourself upset if they don\u2019t help you out when you need it? You don\u2019t have to drive your neighbors anywhere but it would be a super friendly gesture.", "NTA. that is a VERY early favor. my brother came to visit me and his flight landed at 6am.

I asked one of my closest friends to take me to the airport at the end of next month, at a fairly reasonable time. And I even hated to do it, I don't like asking people for favors.

I wouldn't dream of asking an acquaintance/neighbor!", "NTA\n\nThese favors may be escalating and you should want no part in that mess.\n\nThe only way to do that politely was to ask and then PAY you generously for the service.", "I wouldn\u2019t even do that for my husband but then he wouldn\u2019t ask, he would sort out his own transportation.

Only one person I drive to the airport and that\u2019s my mother. \nNTA", "NTA even with close friends who have a car and would probably say yes i would not ask such a favour. I\u2019m taking the taxi to the airports (also 35-40min cases) when the flight is early and i don\u2019t have a better option. It\u2019s part of the travel expenses.", "You are definitely a kind person just because you are struggling with this. I say NTA. That type of favor is something (IMO) you ask a very close friend, but probably really only family.", "NTA!\nThat's really quite the ask. I wouldn't ask my best friend to take me to the airport at that hour, nor would I ask anyone else. You're friendly acquaintances, not even friends by your description. I think you're probably lucky and smart to have put the \"kibosh\" on doing this kind of favor or there would be more.", "Driving somebody to the airport is a big ask. At 5am it's a massive ask. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Driving someone to the airport is a favor you only ask your inner circle: family, partner, close friends. Asking your neighbor for that is inappropriate. If they were desperate, they could ask as long as they couched it with \"I know this is a huge favor and we completely understand if you're not available, but we'd pay you for gas and owe you big-time\" but it doesn't sound like they approached it that way.", "Absolutely NTA that is a massive ask. If they can afford the flights and accommodations they can afford $10 a day in parking or a taxi to/from.", "NTA. I have had good friends turn me down for a ride to the airport that early, and the airport is only a 15-20 minute drive. It\u2019s a lot to ask, and that is very early. As to whether you would be TA if their flight was later, I don\u2019t think so, either. A favor is just that, a favor, and while I\u2019m all about community and serving other people, no one is ever obligated to perform any favor they don\u2019t want to.\n\nHaving said that, it may be they are embarrassed for having even asked.

I'm enjoying the debate over how much time to leave yourself before a flight, though.", "NTA. 5:00 AM flight with a 40 minute drive to the airport means you have to get up much earlier. That's a lot to ask of somebody who is not a relative or a best friend.", "are you an alien? NTA but how are you so unsure of if this was \u201creasonable\u201d or not? like no dude asking your neighbor you barely know to drive you at 4 am to the airport is, in fact, fucking insane.", "NTA\n\nYour neighbors are taking advantage of being on \"friendly terms\" with you. That's why I avoid being on any terms with my neighbors: people just ask and ask and ask for more more more...", "NTA - that's a *big* favor to ask a neighbor. Looking in on pets or picking up the mail is one thing, getting up to drive someone for a 5AM flight is another.", "No you have to get up at 3am -  drop off by 3:40 which is still a bit late for a 5 am flight.", "You\u2019d be insane to get up at 4:20 to drive 40 minutes to the airport and arrive at 5:00 for a flight that leaves at 5:00. Like absolutely nuts. You would have a 0 percent chance to make your flight. Why even bother booking a flight at that stage. You\u2019re just throwing away money.

I can\u2019t fathom expecting someone to drive me to the airport at 3am, at that point I\u2019d Uber or taxi or drive myself", "Dude, I wouldn't do an 80 minute drive at 2:30 am in the morning even for someone I'm married to -- that's why taxis, black cars, Uber and Lyft exit -- unless it were an emergency.  For neighbors?  foah\n\nNot to mention it's hard to imagine this costing you less than $40 between gas and wear and tear on your car.

Even for my sweetie, I'd have to have a bit of a discussion about why she booked such an early flight if she asked, and what the other options were.

No way. \n\nI agree with OP that transport to and from the airport is factored in to the cost of the trip.", "Yeah, I only get picked up when someone insists on doing it  for me, and even then, if I can take cheap public transportation, I'll do that instead. My niece asked me to pick her up at the airport and drive her to a music festival and I flat out said no because my sister (her mom) would never extend me that courtesy, nor would I ask.", "If my best friend asked me this id honestly think they were joking.", "I would absolutely not even ask.", "Not even for someone you\u2019re married to??", "Would you do it for someone who save your life?", "Yes!

Maybe that's why they asked me. Still a \"no\", though.", "Yeah, that was my worry if I hesitated to say no. I didn't want them to feel like they could switch the ask to picking them up.\n\nFor me, the time of day/night wasn't really the issue (although it certainly made the ask a lot worse). I just didn't want to spend 1.5 hours driving to and back from the airport.", "Yeah, like I said, I still would have said no even if it was during the day and I wasn't busy. I figured NTA for middle-of-the-night, but was wondering about during the day if that was the ask.", "Ubers cost extra for night and  very early mornings. Frankly these ppl should have factored in the cost of a 5 am flight. The cab ride costs more even if the flight is cheap. Also they would be massively inconveniencing someone , and I don\u2019t know anyone who would do this for anyone other than very close relatives. Or extreme emergencies. Not for a neighbor\u2019s vacation.", "That's what I've been doing. They just don't walk out to the road to talk anymore. So, I think they're avoiding me, which is fine.", "I think you would be AH if they have ever stuck their neck out for you in a way that is on par with a 80-min car trip.  Like, I'm thinking if they have ever rushed you to the ER, then you'd be socially obligated to drop them off at the airport, provided you've got wheels and you don't have another obligation at that time.  But that's only if we are talking about a trip that's in the middle of the day.\n\nIn the middle of the night?  I might offer to do this for a very good friend who is flying out to deal with a family emergency (dying parent or child) and could use some moral support.  But for a vacation?
