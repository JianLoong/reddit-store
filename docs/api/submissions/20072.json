Personally, I never schedule a flight that requires me to leave the house at that time of day. I would\u2019ve said no also. I think it\u2019s a huge imposition to ask someone to drive you to the airport especially when it\u2019s almost an hour away at that time of day.

Next question pls", "NTA - I really, really like my neighbors and I wouldn\u2019t drive them to the airport, regardless of what time of day it is. Your neighbors asking was very presumptuous  of them. That is way over the line-certainly not a cup of sugar favor.", "NTA, I totally agree with you. It\u2019s weird to ask that of your neighbour thar you don\u2019t know very well.", "NTA.\n\nA 5am flight means you would have to be at the airport anywhere from one hour to two hours before to factor check-in, security etc.  So you would have to leave latest about 3:30, if not earlier.  Which means being up before three to be ready to go.\n\nThat would be a major imposition, even for close family.", "5 AM flight means being at the airport by 3-3:30. Leaving at 230ish. That\u2019s a a big ask. I even grumble (quietly) when I need to drive my wife for an early flight. NTA", "YTA. Not for refusing to drive them, but because I suspect your delivery wasn't very polite. \n\nIt reads like they asked you and you said \"No. Call a taxi.\". Or if you \"acted shocked\" maybe you said something more like \"Are you crazy!? No! Call a taxi!\" Which would explain why they've dialed back the friendly terms of the relationship.\n\nIf these are neighbors that you were on good terms with, a more appropriate response would be \"Sorry, that's a little early for me and doesn't work with my schedule. It would be better to ask someone else or call a taxi.\"\n\nI think that asking someone to drive you to an airport 40 mins away before 5am is a bit much for a favor, but declining requests politely is generally expected to maintain friendly relationships in life.", "Yes, it seemed to me like they were treating me as a free taxi. But, maybe they thought we were better friends than what I consider them?", "5am flight you have to leave 3:30 the latest to check-in and get through airport security. Screw that I'm not waking up for almost anyone that early. Park at the airport as you will need to come back. There is off airport parking also that's cheaper. Uber isn't that expensive either.", "If it\u2019s a 5 am flight and a 40 minute round trip, op would have to get up way earlier than 4:20 am. Leaving time for security, they would probably have to be at the airport by 4 at the very latest. That means *leaving* home by 3:20, and probably getting up by 2:30 or 2:45?\n\nBy the way, why are they planning a vacation when they can\u2019t afford a cab to the airport???", "Depends on your airport and where you are going. When my sister went to Spain, the time choices really sucked for both leaving and arriving at our airport.", "I wouldn't say they're pissed at me. Just kind of put off.\n\nI'm certainly not going to lose any sleep if they never talk to me again, but I'm just wondering if it was a reasonable ask, especially if it wasn't middle-of-the-night.", "This is ridiculous, I would be shocked too if my neighbor asked me to get up at three in the morning to take them to the airport. They\u2019re not friends, they\u2019re neighbors. (Though neighbors can be friends). I assume OP was shocked given THEY (the neighbor) was shocked that they\u2019d say no.\n\nFurthermore if you take them, they\u2019ll probably turn around and ask you to pick them up. \u201cFavors\u201d like these don\u2019t end at one time\u2026\n\nNTA", "Yes, my reaction might have been very direct. I suppose I wanted to shut down any further asks related to this, but I was also genuinely shocked they would ask for a flight in the middle of the night. That's why I'm asking if IATA.", "That's fair. I was very direct (which wasn't polite), but I didn't call them crazy or anything like that.\n\nI think the reason I was so direct is that I didn't want them to ask anything else. If I said, \"5am doesn't work for me\", what if they said, \"we're coming home on an afternoon flight, can you pick us up?\"\n\nI didn't want to drive them at all. Like I said, the middle-of-the-night was a shocker, but I still would have said no if it was another time.", "You \u201csuspect\u201d \nand \u201cmaybe you said\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s code for speculative bullshit. Judging by the info presented and not that which you made up\u2026 OP is in no way TA.", "Have they ever done that level of a favor for you, which would reasonably lead them to believe that they were better friends?", "More favors was part of my worry. The middle-of-the-night was clearly a non-starter for me, but like I said, I still would have said no to a daytime flight. We're friendly, but not what I would consider friends.\n\nI'm not sure if they got a drive from someone else or not.", "IMO responding that way just escalated a situation that really didn't need any escalating. Yeah, it's kinda a big ask - but maybe they are coming from a place of misunderstanding the closeness of your friendship, not a place of entitlement? Responding, politely, that you wouldn't be able to spend an hour and a half traveling to/from the airport in the early morning before work would have been 1. True and 2. Maintained a positive rapport with your neighbors. If these requests keep rolling in from your neighbors - sure, start getting snippy about it. I just don't think it's at the point where you needed to handle the request this way and create tension for no reason. Obviously, there are many other people here who disagree with my assessment. :) *shrug*", "Yes and that's fine too. I find \"Sorry, that doesn't work for me/with my schedule.\" is my go-to decline phrase. If my schedule is that I plan to be playing video games and drinking margaritas, well, they don't need to know that.", "No, but I've never asked for any favors from them. Didn't ever have the need to. I've done them minor favors in the past, but nothing on this level.", "I disagree there is nothing wrong with being direct, it leaves no room for misinterpretation or like OP said other favours that could be asked."]}
