I declined any medical assistance at the scene as none of my airbags deployed and besides being madder than hell, I was thankfully okay. \n\nAbout three hours later, the adrenaline wears off and I\u2019m having really bad back pain and a headache. My family was telling me to get checked out, but I had no ride. \n\nI had mentioned the accident to a woman I\u2019ve been seeing lately, who I\u2019ve known for a while, and she offered to take me. I thought it was a really nice thing to offer, and having no ride, I accepted. \n\nFlash forward to her picking me up (this is around 5 on a Friday) and after getting into the car, she is *nuclear* pissed off at me. She asks why I didn\u2019t just Uber, or ask someone else to give me a ride who was closer. For context, she lives in a neighboring town about 10-15 min away. \n\nI replied that, you had offered me ride, so I accepted. I was stunned as she had not indicated even the slightest annoyance at me to this point, or that this was something she did not want to do. The next ten minutes involve me getting brow beaten for being inconsiderate, \u201cnot thinking\u201d, and how literally anyone else should be doing this, or how i should have taken an ambulance, or my favorite, that three hours between car accident, tow, and walking home was sufficient to get a rental car sorted with my insurance. \n\nThat car ride was arguably worse than the accident itself. I spent the entire the time at the urgent care either choking up or outright weeping because of guilt, confusion, and possibly head injury. (Thank you to the wonderful nurse who talked to me about my shirt to calm me down.)\n\nI had asked her to leave and I would get a cab or something home like she wanted but she stayed and we drove home in mostly silence until she dropped me off and meekly said \u201csorry you were in an accident, I hope you feel better.\u201d I said thank you and that I was sorry about all this. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEDIT: ducking autocorrect", "created_utc": 1691234948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ita47/aitah_for_accepting_a_ride_to_urgent_care/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
