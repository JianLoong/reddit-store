{"id": 14712, "submission_id": "12kzkdl", "title": "AITA For going to happy hour after work when my husband \"can't\"", "selftext": " My husband (38M) and I (39F) have a 3-year-old son who is in daycare during the day. Both my husband and I work full-time. However, my husband has an 8-minute commute and I have a 20-mile drive through the city which can sometimes take me up to an hour depending on traffic. When we were looking at daycare centers for our son, we looked at options near both of our offices and found one we loved that is only 2 miles from where my husband works. Given his short commute and the center's proximity to both his job and our house, it was an easy choice.\n\nObviously, this meant that he would be doing pretty much all of the drop-offs and pick-ups for our son. This also meant that if our son had to be picked up early for whatever reason, it would pretty much always fall on him to pick him up. This worked fine for the most part, even during Covid.\n\nI work in a pretty male-dominated field (natural resources) and there is definitely a \"good ol' boys\" mentality whether I like it or not. Especially amongst my older coworkers who also happen to be the decision-makers and higher-ups. My husband understands this and knows that I often have to go above and beyond to get noticed.\n\nA few of these higher-ups go to happy hour once or twice a week. There is often a lot of shop-talk there and I've found that when I go to them, I miraculously get put on better projects and programs. It also helps that I can wait out traffic and only get home maybe 30-45 minutes later than I usually would if I just sit in traffic. But these events are almost always spontaneous and rarely planned in advance.\n\nMy husband has been getting more and more annoyed when I tell him that I am going to happy hour. I always try to let him know as early in the day as possible so he can plan, but the last few times he's given me responses like \"Again?\" and \"Are you serious?\"\n\nWe got into an argument about it last week. I went to a happy hour and my boss ended up putting me on a project that I've been really pushing for. When I got home I was really excited and was telling my husband about it. He was just kind of nodding and giving one-word answers and I finally asked him what his problem was because he knows how much I had been wanting this project and I had hoped he would be happy for me too.\n\nHe said he's tired of me going to happy hours when he \"can't\" because he has to pick up our son every day. He said he knows that I feel like I \"need\" to go to them to get ahead, but that it's wearing on him because he feels like he doesn't ever get a chance to unwind after work like I do. He goes straight from work to being a parent while I'm off having drinks and socializing.\n\nI told him that most of the time I'm not even drinking and I just have an appetizer and talk with coworkers to wait out traffic. I told him it's directly beneficial to my career to do this whether I agree with it or not and he should be happy that I'm finally being noticed.", "created_utc": 1681412281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kzkdl/aita_for_going_to_happy_hour_after_work_when_my/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you give him any opportunities to let him get away from being a parent and unwinding?", "Can you not hire a babysitter once or twice a week? Put the babysitter's name on the list of approved pick-up people for your kid at the daycare and leave extra money for the sitter to order dinner or something. It's really not that difficult. Your husband will be able to relax after work once/twice a week the way you get to during happy hour.", "YTA - Your comment that you are not even drinking most of the time, just having an appetizer, demonstrates that you are not hearing what he is saying at all. I am not saying that you should never go to happy hour and I do understand the impact going (or not) can have on your career. But you are completely invalidating his feelings and making no effort to find a way to compromise or balance the load.  \n\nHow about asking him what you can do on nights when you don't go to happy hour so that he can get some time to unwind?", "YTA. You shouldn't go every single time. Your husband is right. He deserves a break as much as you do. \n\nInfo: Who makes more? Who has the longer shift? How are chores split? Does he get some time during the weekends to unwind?", "YTA because you're not willing to admit that he's in a shitty position here. All you're seeing is how your position at work benefits from these work-related happy hours and weekends.\n\nAnd encouraging him to go out when he doesn't have a chance to make plans, because he never knows if you'll be able to take the kid or not, is not helpful. You're expecting him to organise his whole life around your work schedule. \n\nYour husband is basically like a doctor on call 24/7 with no time off. I'd be pretty pissed, too.\n\nYou need to make plans with a babysitter, so he can have time off too. Ideally one evening a week, he can play darts at the pub or join a language learning course or whatever he enjoys and the babysitter is booked no matter what, even if you are available.", "I'm leaning more towards YTA than any of the other possible options. Not directly because you're going to these Happy Hours as often as you are, but mostly that you don't seem to see that your husband is asking for a break. I understand that the daycare you've chosen and your careers force him to handle drop-off and pickup, but you gotta do something to give the guy a break. Your happy hours likely wouldn't bother him so much if he got to cut loose occasionally (even if that isn't what you're doing).", "YTA.  I wasn't sure until I read your comments.  Your husband is doing all of the emotional labor in this family because of your job.  You need to find a way to give him a break.", "Well, your bosses are the biggest AHs for offering job advancement opportunities based on participation in non-work social events that penalizes people with family responsibilities (and people with alcohol problems, and people with eating disorders, and people--particularly women--who might feel uncomfortable about attending events with blurred social rules with people who have the power to significantly impact their careers, etc). And it's particularly AH-ish to call these events \"happy hours\" since that makes it seem like fun social gatherings, rather than honestly acknowledging that it is \"off the clock\" work that employees aren't being compensated for.\n\nBut while your husband could be more sympathetic regarding your need to participate in a work activity that is inaccurately labeled as a \"happy hour,\" yes, YTA for not recognizing the burden that is being placed on him.\n\nThe part that sticks out to me the most in your explanation is the part where your husband is dealing with early pickups. Don't get me wrong, I totally get why it makes sense for him to deal with the day-to-day commuting since that is the more efficient option. But once you're talking about an early pickup, there's no reason why it should always fall to him to leave his work early. And honestly, it might make sense for you to pick the day that your workplace is least likely to do happy hours, and have that be your designated day for picking up your son so your husband gets one day a week to unwind after work.", "Yta you're working over time twice a week?  Yeah, no wonder he's annoyed.  And they're last minute? And you work 1 or 2 weekend's a month??\n\nYou say you encourage him to go out but how the F is he supposed to make plans when all your over time is last minute and unplanned?\n\nWhy should he be happy thay you're buying into a toxic work environment and being taken advantage of by your company?\n\nIf your husand was on here posting that he works full time, does the majority of childcare, and house work people who be telling him to shop doing shit for you. No more coming home to dinner ready. No more him doing your laundry or your dishes. People would be asking him 'what does she contribute to your marriage?'", "YTA. Every week?  Twice a week?  Your husband is getting the short end of the stick.", "YTA. Multiple times a week, with little to no notice, and no change when your husband has expressed his discomfort with the issue? He picks the kids up and from a comment you've made does most of the cooking. I get it's for your job, but if the roles were reversed your husband would be crucified on here.", "YTA. You should at least be accommodating him as well like giving him free time to decompress if you aren\u2019t.", "YTA - I understand you\u2019re trying to be noticed at work and going to happy hour helps you do that. However, your work success and happiness shouldn\u2019t come at your husband\u2019s expense and happiness. He\u2019s probably exhausted.\n\nIt may help to put yourself in his shoes and think about how you would feel if he was going to happy hour (drinking or not) with coworkers - mostly female - while you were home taking care of your child\u2026twice a week. \n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d get frustrated after awhile too.\n\nI\u2019m curious if he gets an opportunity to decompress? He may need it.", " YTA- you obviously have little respect for your husbands work and time. You can\u2019t leave work early ever but he can pick up your son everyday and he has to leave work early every time your son is sick. \nI\u2019m not seeing much support on here for you which makes me happy, because I know if this was a wife complaining about how her husband left her with the kids twice a week and went to the bar, we would all say he was the asshole.", "YTA, not because you go to happy hour, but because your husband has clearly stated his issue: *\"****he feels like he doesn't ever get a chance to unwind after work\"***\n\nand you haven't acknowledged that you understand his issue and want to work with him to find a way for him to also get a chance to unwind.  Can you work remote one or two days a week?  Can you come in earlier and leave earlier to pick up your son?   Is there other ways he can get time to unwind?", "YTA. From the comments, he's holding down the responsibilities at home, doing most of the cooking and childcare, on top of working full time. Leaving that out of the main part makes you look extra bad, and im sure that's even downplayed. You better hope he doesn't decide to keep being a single parent with one less kid and drop you.", "Nope, YTA.\n\nYou aren\u2019t listening because you\u2019re so focused on yourself and your goals. He\u2019s telling you this arrangement isn\u2019t working anymore.\n\nStart listening before he tells you that in 50/50 custody you\u2019ll be missing happy hour half the time regardless.\n\nLook for the root of the problem and alleviate it.\n\nOn Happy Hour Days, when you get home - he gets to clock out of parenting duties. Or you agree that once a week, you leave work early to beat the traffic and get your son. Or you look for a new job. Or he does. Or a new daycare center.\n\nLots of options behind giving your husband the middle finger and a tired excuse of \u201cBut I need this for my career.\u201d That doesn\u2019t work from men to women and it doesn\u2019t work here from you to him.", "I left a couple comments, but here's my judgement: **YTA**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no \"good ol' boys club\" that refuses to recognize that all the responsibility for raising a child and caring for the household cannot fall just on one person. Even when I was in the Navy, a land full of toxic behavior and \"good ol' boys\" behavior, they understood when a parent had to pick up some of the home or childcare duties. And, based on what you wrote in this post, letting all the household and child care duties fall on just one person is exactly what's happening. Let's break it down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) Your husband is responsible for dropping off, picking up, and handling the early release of your child, every single day.\n\n2.) You state that these \"happy hours\" are at fully random times, meaning that there's no possible way to plan around them.\n\n3.) You state that you are required to work weekends 1-2 times per month, meaning around 50% of the time, you're having working weekends - meaning he's not able to plan for even a weekend day off since he doesn't know when he'd possibly have time free.\n\n4.) You require him to do all the cooking for the household. You claim other household work is split \"as evenly as possible,\" but given your narration so far, I'm forced to conclude that he shoulders the majority of that as well.\n\n5.) **He** is the primary breadwinner in the household - you stated in a comment that he had the higher income, not you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith those points in mind, how could you be anything but TA? You are jeopardizing his mental and physical health with the stress and inability to relax (which can also lead to emotional distress as he slips into depression and loneliness), which puts your entire family at risk as if he breaks down, there's a very real chance he loses his job or suffers a demotion, which means the primary breadwinner can no longer provide. Do these bonus projects of yours bring in the difference in pay that would be required to support the family if that happened? Do you even have a maximum earning potential to do that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLife in a relationship is about more than just you, and compromises have to be made. Right now, your husband is signaling that he feels like he's making all the compromises - and it really does look like, based on this post, that he's right. It's time to stop dismissing his needs and to take him seriously before something worse happens and you wake up one day wondering where it all went wrong.", "YTA for sure. you're acting like because he works so close to the daycare, you don't have the same responsibility to come home after work, whereas he doesn't have a choice. make it a point to give your husband the same amount of \"happy hour\" time you take, and i guarantee he wouldn't be upset with you for going.", "YTA. You're being a bad partner. You're husband is dropping off/picking up the child that you both had, and you claim he handles the cooking. On top of that you claim to work a lot of weekend.. It isn't fair that you are socializing, regardless if it for better work perks, while your partner is doing the role of both parents. \n\nYou chose the job that put you far from home. You need to find a way to better jugle your career and family.", "YTA\n\nOnce in a while would be perfectly reasonable, but once or twice a week is ridiculous.  It sounds like you're avoiding going home on purpose.", "YTA. Multiple happy hours a week is excessive, no matter how beneficial it could be for your career.\n\nHe needs downtime too.", "I also work in natural resources, I am a male, and I 100% agree with your assessment. It is a heavily, heavily, (white) male-dominated career, and a lot of the people in charge are the good old boy stereotypes. With all that being said, YTA.  You have made a unilateral decision to prioritize your career ambitions at this particular employer over your family in general, and your husband in specific. This is not something you both agreed upon, it was not discussed, and you are doing it quite frequently. As much as I personally understand what you are trying to do, if this is what it truly takes to get ahead at your current employer, maybe it\u2019s time to start looking around for a more forward thinking organization.", "YTA\n\nYour husband has needs to and you're totaly dismissing them b/c you're trying to advance in your career. Not ok.", "YTA -- if you keep going to these functions as often. You know now how much it bothers your husband that you go to the happy hour things. So, cut in half the number of times you attend.. \n\nI get being in a male dominated field. I've been in IT over 30 years -- really, I do get it. But your husband is more important. Just tell your co-workers something along the lines of \"I can't tonight - I need to get home to my husband and son.\" Then do that.", "Why bother coming here asking if your the AH, if you just make excuses?? Majority says you are. \n\nBeen in your husbands shoes, my ex husband tried to pull this crap on me for years. I was stuck home doing everything after getting off work while he was out making \"work connections\". God I resented him for it. He got to go and be around people in a relax environment. I was stuck home after a 10 hour shift listening to dora the explorer and folding clothes.\n\nIf you have to decide your marriage or your job. I can tell you he is probably starting to resent you already. \n\n( oh by the way I also work in a male dominant field power engineer and I get it but you need to figure out the balance quick, start by giving your head a shake and try being in your husbands shoes.)", "YTA you need to find a way to give your husband time off. Your relationship shouldn\u2019t always be catered towards you. Why did you even have a child?", "YTA because this is a very one-sided arrangement. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it is drinking/socializing versus beneficial to your career, where is his break? If you're going out once or twice a week, why aren't you arranging a way to pick up your son one night a week so your partner can also have some kind of after-work-unwind opportunity? \n\nYou should be able to go to these events, but he should be able to get a break. You haven't shown us that you are trying to meet him in the middle, only that it's your way or the highway.", "I have a feeling that you purposely left out how often you join the happy hour. If it is weekly, than YTA.\n\nIt seems that all the reasons you are naming are plain excuses and that you genuinely enjoy joining your coworkers. What makes you the AH in my oppinion is that you don\u2019t take into consideration your husband feelings. You should compromise and maybe join the happy hour just twice a month since he is literally unable ever to go for a drink after work.", "YTA. You are not listening. Your partner is telling you he needs a break too. He needs time to unwind and all you are saying is me me me. What I want.", "YTA let him relax after work for once.

You don\u2019t have to go to every happy hour and family should comes first. With how you are responding to the comments we can tell you don\u2019t value some of the work he is doing. Think about your future and what do you want from it.", "INFO: How long have you been having an affair?", "The fact you're more career minded than concerned about your family dynamic is a major red flag.  \nAs has been said, he's the main earner, deals with all the childcare and does the cooking.

O.o\n\nThen it doesn\u2019t matter who turns him in on mornings and it\u2019s basically the same commute when going home so in both cases it\u2019s much easier to switch when somebody gets caught up at work or in traffic.", "If he left you, would you notice? , I don't think he would.", "YTA you know you are you were just hoping for the female vote in this. Well female here that worked as a Marine engineer as well as journeyman outside machinist, you do not get much more male dominated than that. I made supervisor by the time I was 24 because I knew my shit and could hold my own but I never sacrificed my family to do so.

Not only do you get to go out once or twice a week, but you also said in a comment you work 1-2 weekend a month. So when does he get a break? When do you get time together?

Both my husband and I work full-time. However, my husband has an 8-minute commute and I have a 20-mile drive through the city which can sometimes take me up to an hour depending on traffic. When we were looking at daycare centers for our son, we looked at options near both of our offices and found one we loved that is only 2 miles from where my husband works. Given his short commute and the center's proximity to both his job and our house, it was an easy choice.\n\nObviously, this meant that he would be doing pretty much all of the drop-offs and pick-ups for our son. This also meant that if our son had to be picked up early for whatever reason, it would pretty much always fall on him to pick him up. This worked fine for the most part, even during Covid.\n\nI work in a pretty male-dominated field (natural resources) and there is definitely a \"good ol' boys\" mentality whether I like it or not. Especially amongst my older coworkers who also happen to be the decision-makers and higher-ups. My husband understands this and knows that I often have to go above and beyond to get noticed.\n\nA few of these higher-ups go to happy hour once or twice a week. There is often a lot of shop-talk there and I've found that when I go to them, I miraculously get put on better projects and programs. It also helps that I can wait out traffic and only get home maybe 30-45 minutes later than I usually would if I just sit in traffic. But these events are almost always spontaneous and rarely planned in advance.\n\nMy husband has been getting more and more annoyed when I tell him that I am going to happy hour. I always try to let him know as early in the day as possible so he can plan, but the last few times he's given me responses like \"Again?\" and \"Are you serious?\"\n\nWe got into an argument about it last week. I went to a happy hour and my boss ended up putting me on a project that I've been really pushing for. When I got home I was really excited and was telling my husband about it. He was just kind of nodding and giving one-word answers and I finally asked him what his problem was because he knows how much I had been wanting this project and I had hoped he would be happy for me too.\n\nHe said he's tired of me going to happy hours when he \"can't\" because he has to pick up our son every day. He said he knows that I feel like I \"need\" to go to them to get ahead, but that it's wearing on him because he feels like he doesn't ever get a chance to unwind after work like I do. He goes straight from work to being a parent while I'm off having drinks and socializing.\n\nI told him that most of the time I'm not even drinking and I just have an appetizer and talk with coworkers to wait out traffic. I told him it's directly beneficial to my career to do this whether I agree with it or not and he should be happy that I'm finally being noticed.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it\u2019s wrong for those men to do it then it\u2019s wrong for her to do it", "Genders reversed nothing changes. If OP was a man he/she would still suck and the parthner would still be N T A. How does he suck for not getting the benifits of double standards?

He does most of the cooking, chores and parenting.", "Why would he get any time off", "How is the husband TA in any way, shape or form here?", "She also works two weekends a month so I would highly guess he gets maybe 4 days if that to go do something", "Thank you for convincing me that OP is YTA. \n\n\nYou completely invalidated the husband's complaint (he is entirely carrying the childcare responsibility and isn't getting a break).", "It's also *her* son", "\\*their son", "Why wouldn\u2019t she be responsible for her child? He is also her son.", "Nobody is ignoring that. I think you're ignoring that the husband has all of the responsibilities at the moment, gets no break, and based on the judgment system here, NTA implies husband is TA.", "No they wouldn't. If the wife made most of the money, most of the chores, and had to leave work every day and directly pick up the kid, while the husband gets happy hours and time to relax, they would tear him apart.\n\nThe drinking is completely irrelevant, the husband's issue is he gets no time to relax, he goes straight from work mode into parent mode. It's wearing him down and OP refuses to even acknowledge his perspective.", "Neither of us are big drinkers to begin with.  I usually just have a soda and an appetizer when I go out.  My husband rarely drinks at all, usually only at gatherings or a drink if we go out to dinner.", "According to comments she also works weekend 2x a month and he does most of the cooking.", "So what happens if he plans a weekend getaway with the boys then you end up having to work that weekend? You get child care! \n\nCome on, give this guy a break. I'd be saying the same thing if the roles were reversed.", "But you don't give him time to schedule anything.

If he's making twice yours, I'd think you'd be the one to pull back to help parent your kid. As time goes forward, maybe you can ramp back up a bit. But your 9-5 plus once or twice per week happy hours plus once or twice per month weekends is draining him, and he doesn't know how to properly address it. Here's why: he wants you, his wife, to get ahead and kick ass at work. And bring in more money to give the family an even better life than you might already have. Maybe that money means a better school for the kid, or a newer car, or a nicer vacation or whatever it is. He also wants his wife and he's telling you, right wrong or indifferent, he's getting pretty drained.\n\nDon't focus on who's the asshole, focus on meeting your husbands needs as I'd imagine he'd do for you. If that idea will simply cause combativeness, that's not good.

I get that you want to advance in your career, but this whole scenario would make a lot more sense if you were the primary breadwinner.  As it is, he's doing the majority of the financial lifting, all the drop-off/pick-up kid duty, all the dinners, and it sounds like at least half the housework.  This is so unbalanced it's nuts.  Your husband needs a break.  You get two breaks a week at happy and he gets none.  And, again, he's still making way more money than you. There is no scenario where this makes sense.", "Ohhh dude. You need to be better about this. Your husband needs some time to himself; gotta figure out how to make it happen.", "He says it makes it more difficult? It is more difficult when you take up half the weekends and half the weekday evenings.", "So he's doing all the work at home.  No wonder he needs a break.", "Very easy to fall into a loss of identity. Was happening to my partner and I but with acknowledgement of it happening and effort we have been marking strides. \n\nThere was no me, I was Dad. There was no her, she was Mom. And there was a loss of us as a couple, there was family.\n\nObviously helped my partner and I but we also saw noticeable improvements in the kids. They kids got to be individuals instead of the amorphous blob of roles and show dogs.", "So, when does *HE* get a break?!?!", "Yeah hun you have to sort this with your husband. He needs to feel like he's getting something out of this deal.    Lighten his load. Get meal kits delivered and hire a cleaner. Also have a friend or babysitter who is authorized to pick your child up once or twice a week. He also has to look after his job security as well. What if he gets laid off because he keeps missing out on extracurricular activities? \n\nHalf your weekends are spent working? He does pretty much all the chores because you are away from home so much? I wouldn't blame him if he thinks you're having an affair.", "So he's doing the parenting and your hardly home?

YTA", "At the very least you need to start making more meals so he doesn't have to do all of the cooking. 2-3 times a week, you can get up a little earlier before work and make some crockpot meals that can cook all day and all he has to do is serve.\n\nLong-term, though, you need to look at how viable it is for you to climb to the top of this field quickly enough that you aren't going to nuke your marriage in order to do so. Your husband is shouldering a *lot* of the load here, and that isn't sustainable.", "What a awful relationship he got, he deserve better. YTA.", "Along with some other unflattering comments \ud83d\ude44", "This is the right answer. It benefits her career to go to these things, which is ridiculous but she can\u2019t exactly change the system. She should figure out another way to balance things out.", "This is the correct response. If you're going to expect him to pick up the slack when your work requires your time, you need to give something in return.", "When you have a child you are agreeing to sacrifice things. As it currently stands, only one person in the relationship is making sacrifices and that person is asking for help from someone who is suppose to be a partner to them. \n\nThe needs of the child come first, and having one parent being burnt out from being over burdened will lead these problems only growing to the point the child is negatively affected.\n\nAssuming she wants to keep the family together, she will likely need to make sacrifices. If this should continue it could lead to separation or divorce which would damage the happy hour availability regardless.", "This, she's only getting home 30-45 minutes later  he has to pick up the kid either way, so he can't go out and do something straight after work either way.\n\nShe needs to do this, but they need to balance it where he gets his break other times as you said", "She has not mentioned a single thing about a compromise or sacrifice she has made to let him do things like that. \n\nBut I do agree that it may be necessary.", "Oh please, that's such a cop out. I'm a female working in a made dominant field and make it home every day by 6 pm at the latest. If you're career is more important than your family, then she should not be married or have chosen to have kids. \n\nIf she dies tomorrow, who do you think is going to be more impacted?", "It's because every single day he has to go straight from work to daycare. He can't relax or decompress until she gets home to help. While she gets to have fun at happy hour, he is physically and mentally exhausted. And she won't even discuss a solution with him.", "I think you\u2019re looking at this wrong. 30-45 minutes extra *on top of* her *longer* commute.", "It's not 30-45 minutes extra, she goes to happy hour. Socialises and then has a 30-45 minute drive home. This could be almost 2 hours after work rather than the hour it takes initially.", "Oh, you mean you would have to actually parent and put your needs second?!\n\nYou're incredibly self centred. It's all about your needs/wishes. Nothing at all about your husband and more importantly your child's needs.\n\nYour child barely gets to see you week days.

Why bother being in a relationship when you don't ever compromise or put the other family members first?", "So ... do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs your husband not worth even the occasional \"Hey, I've gotta head out early today to get my son, my husband has something he needs to do today\"?", "Then do that.", "Could you go to work early or work through lunch and leave early?

You leave work early.", "Plus the over times and weekends she works. Its more than half an hour one or twice a week :). Her husband has to do most of the cooking, chores, parenting AND earns 2x more, while not getting any break.", "? Never said he was, just that OP isn't either.  I actually suggested they look for ways to help the husband get more free time too.  There doesn't always have to be an AH.", "Right, so OP definitely needs to find a way to balance that more, probably getting alternate childcare on the weekends she works.  It doesn't sound, though, from the info given, that skipping the happy hours is a good option for her career.  They need to find some other options that let her advance and also give him some more free days.", "Honestly, same. As the main parent responsible for our toddler, seeing someone belittle all the stuff you do every. Single. Day. With a little one is so unnecessary? Mean spirited?? I would love to have the chance to go out and not drink near other adults once \u2026well, ever! Maybe even enjoy a meal without having to stop and grab things and help another tiny human before rushing into the next task so they aren\u2019t melting down at bed time.

Hopefully husband sees the writing on the wall.", "Yeah, he\u2019d be doing that regardless. She had a shit commute which sucks and prevents her from being able to pick up the kid.\n\nThis sounds bad because happy hour is usually associated with fun. But as others pointed out this kind of stuff is quietly mandatory to get ahead in some careers.\n\nFurther it only adds at most 1.5 hrs of kid watching per week because of her shit commute. If this was her killing time at the gym (which is what I used to do when I had a shit commute) there would be way less grumbles. If the genders were reversed I\u2019d doubt she\u2019d even think to complain.\n\nDad gets a morning or afternoon of alone time during the weekend. That more than makes up for it.", "I doubt the happy hour is relaxing for her. It\u2019s work. I also have to go to these sorts of events sometimes and believe me, they are awful. Like I would so much rather not go to them, but they do help a lot. \n\nAnd honestly, that\u2019s kind of what they signed up for with the daycare being right next to his work.", "Right, but her having the longer commute and him being next to the daycare is the arrangement they both agreed on.", "Idk if yall saw it but they really said to get their MIL off their back :) YTA x 1000", "I can't do that every week though.", "Then you\u2019re judgement is NAH (no assholes here)", "Right, but he is also doing extra work. I fail to see how he is the AH based on your NTA judgment. If you had said NAH that would be different.", "After the exhaustion has long kicked in. You have to at least recognize its not the same.", "I\u2019m sure his next wife will be more understanding", "He's still providing the vast majority of everything in the relationship. He's asking you to act like his partner, and you refuse to even acknowledge the issue. What makes you think he's going to stick around when you openly place your career over your family?", "How generous of you.", "YTA your husband is an amazing parent and husband you are going to end up loosing. The weekends you are not working he should have completely off and you do both the kid duties and chores while he gets to do absolutely nothing and enjoy his time.

We're probably missing a lot of op's behaviors.", "No, I won't. If you don't make your family a priority, don't have one.

He's been doing this every week for we don't know how long, and he just wants a little break. All parents -- all humans -- need a little break from the grind sometimes. Recognize that he's getting burnt out and make a plan together to get him a break before he snaps. When it's your turn to head toward a meltdown, he can do the same for you. If the genders were reversed on this, husband would be slaughtered on here.", "But you can stay late *twice* a week?", "Don't expect to be married much longer. You have made it perfectly clear to him that you care more about your career than your husband or kid.", "Okay, then you can't do happy hour every week. Sounds simple enough.", "Hahahaha but you CAN stay late every week right?  Also what kind of male-dominated office-based natural resources job doesn't pay well? Timber, oil and mining ALL pay well for sales and engineering jobs, which are the only ones I can think of where there are \"projects\" that in this case get assigned based on attendance at Shenanigans.", "But you can stay out late multiple times every week.", "But you can go to happy hour a couple of times a week?", "He\u2019s still TA because he sees the happy hours as her relaxing time, when he should know that they\u2019re not. Women always get vilified for prioritizing their careers, and while I\u2019m not surprised that Reddit is making a massive deal about an extra 1.5 hours a week *max*, her husband should be doing better than that.", "I can already see OP with the surprised pikachu face when he serves the divorce.", "She\u2019s spending **at most** and extra hour and a half away every week for these happy hours.

He cooks because he\u2019s home earlier, which would happen whether or not she goes to these happy hours. \n\nAlso, again, he\u2019s not complaining about the 2 weekends a month, so it\u2019s likely that they already have something worked out for those weekends. \n\nAnd again, it\u2019s 1.5 hours extra per week max. Stop vilifying women for actually wanting to have a career.", "Maybe instead of them both going to happy hour, a babysitter could allow them to have a date night.", "Starting to wonder what exactly OPs job role is here...", "Lol, no Reddit is making a big deal because she is shouldering him with all of the responsibility and refusing to compromise at all. He's not even vilifying her for prioritizing her career. She's not getting paid for this and it's not mandatory, and I'm quite sure if she went to one a couple times a month instead of 4-8 times a month, and explained she needed to deal with some child care stuff the other times I HIGHLY doubt they'd punish her for that.", "Right? He makes more. She said she only had the kid to get MIL off her back. She\u2019s more interested in opinion of the men at her work than her husband.

Hopefully he's realized that his wife doesn't actually care about him.", "Exactly \u2026 he\u2019s already doing everything while his wife sips a seltzer and monches on apps after work, while he takes care of the kid AND earns more.", "For 1.5 hours a week? You actually believe that a man would be getting the same judgement for spending an extra 1.5 hours per week max at these things? Lol sure.", "Lol so a parent working 1.5 hours of overtime every week is clearly not prioritizing their family enough? And you would say that to the OP regardless of their gender? I call bullshit.", "Been called a pick me one too many times, I\u2019m guessing?", "It is when the spouse is making it clear it's a problem. I get you hate men, but believe it or not marriage is about partnership. And when a partner has a problem, they need to figure out how to resolve it.
