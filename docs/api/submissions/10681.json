You were raised in it, you practice it, all of your friends, family, institutions, and community belong to it. The traditions you practice, the holidays you enjoy, your religion, the things under the bed that scare you, those are all part of that culture.\n\nEven if you knew you had native DNA from childhood, that wouldn't change your culture. \n\nYou don't have all of the above in the native community. \n\nYour bio dad never sought you out, neither did his family.\n\nIf your white mom and dad dropped child you off on the \"'rez\" for weekends, you'd still be an outsider there, because you'd go home and your home wasn't on the rez.\n\nIf your bio dad *had* claimed you and raised you half the time, you'd still be a mix of two separate cultures. Belonging to both and neither.\n\nIf everyone had known as you grew up, maybe you wouldn't have been fending off quips about being the Mexican sibling, BUT you would have gotten a bunch of jibes about being a bastard.\n\nSo no, your life would not be magically fixed if your mom had said anything.\n\nPlease stop romanticizing what your life would have been like \"if only\" she had told. In all likelihood, her husband would have dumped her, and you would have been raised without a father, either step or bio, in much worse conditions, and *still* wouldn't be living out the \"communal natives\" fantasy in your head (which, quite frankly, is super white to even think) \n\nAt best, you can achieve a creolization of both cultures. But you'll have to genuinely live out the native culture to make that happen, and again, you'll never fully rid yourself of your current one.\n\nI think you're mainly running to embrace this new culture because 1) your physical features are considered less desirable or attractive in your current culture and as a teen, that smarts and you want to at least blend in, and 2) you are rejecting your mom, and this is symbolic of all of that.", "[removed]", "OP, I agree with this comment 100%!

Its understandable that you feel you don't belong because you've been raised/made to feel like that.
