You were raised in it, you practice it, all of your friends, family, institutions, and community belong to it. The traditions you practice, the holidays you enjoy, your religion, the things under the bed that scare you, those are all part of that culture.\n\nEven if you knew you had native DNA from childhood, that wouldn't change your culture. \n\nYou don't have all of the above in the native community. \n\nYour bio dad never sought you out, neither did his family.\n\nIf your white mom and dad dropped child you off on the \"'rez\" for weekends, you'd still be an outsider there, because you'd go home and your home wasn't on the rez.\n\nIf your bio dad *had* claimed you and raised you half the time, you'd still be a mix of two separate cultures. Belonging to both and neither.\n\nIf everyone had known as you grew up, maybe you wouldn't have been fending off quips about being the Mexican sibling, BUT you would have gotten a bunch of jibes about being a bastard.\n\nSo no, your life would not be magically fixed if your mom had said anything.\n\nPlease stop romanticizing what your life would have been like \"if only\" she had told. In all likelihood, her husband would have dumped her, and you would have been raised without a father, either step or bio, in much worse conditions, and *still* wouldn't be living out the \"communal natives\" fantasy in your head (which, quite frankly, is super white to even think) \n\nAt best, you can achieve a creolization of both cultures. But you'll have to genuinely live out the native culture to make that happen, and again, you'll never fully rid yourself of your current one.\n\nI think you're mainly running to embrace this new culture because 1) your physical features are considered less desirable or attractive in your current culture and as a teen, that smarts and you want to at least blend in, and 2) you are rejecting your mom, and this is symbolic of all of that.", "[removed]", "OP, I agree with this comment 100%!

Its understandable that you feel you don't belong because you've been raised/made to feel like that.

This is hard and complex with very few easy answers. Except that you are absolutely NTA. \n\nI am going to give you a\u2026very strange\u2026book recommendation. It is not your situation, but you might find a few parallels. The book is \u201cThe Devil Comes Courting\u201d by Courtney Milan. It is a historical romance set mainly in China that is about struggling to connect with culture. One of the protagonists is a Chinese woman who was raised in a European family. A lot of her arc focuses on her finding her cultural identity. There are also some very complicated family relationships. \n\nI recommend this here because I think you might relate to some of the emotional journey and emotional payoff. I also recommend it because it shows someone who feels culturally adrift getting a happily ever after (a romance genre requirement.)", "Nta.\n\nI cannot complete relate to your circumstance, but I can relate to the part of not feeling like you belong anywhere. I am half Chinese half European, and I don't feel like I really belong to either group.\n\nIf you ever want to chat to have someone understand how it feels, and how I've dealt with it/come to terms with it, feel free to msg me.", ">It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t feel drawn to them, but I feel culturally behind and out of place due to the strange circumstances of how I grew up. I\u2019ve also had a white friend tell me I\u2019m \u201cbrown on the outside but white on the inside\u201d and that always echoes in my head when I attend events and workshops.\n\nNTA. I think if you confided in your Native family about your outsider feelings that they'd be able to support you with this. Although your specific situation could be unique, I'm sure there's other people who feel caught in between like you do.", "I want to begin this by saying I think you are NTA and will not defend your mother here, but in an attempt to help you heal, would like to pose some points for you that I pray you appreciate. What would have changed in your life had you known that your father was native? You'd have been raised by the same people. You'd have the same family, been loved by the same people, and unfortunately, been ridiculed by the same people. You'd still have dealt with the issues you explained. \n\nBy no means am I defending your mother, but from an emotional perspective, it's often too easy to consider something like that as life-defining when it wouldn't have changed a lot about you. You would still be the same person, growing up in the same house with the same people around. Perhaps your mother wanted you to feel a part of the family you had and was worried you wouldn't see the person you grew up with as \"dad\" the same way. \n\nAs you point out, he is still your dad, which I think is a positive thing. But I have to ask why you truly feel disconnected. Your dad, who isn't your dad and likely always knew it, chose to fill that role anyway and raise you as best as he believed he could, treating you as no different than his child. I believe that the love of a child chosen is a lot more powerful than the love of a child made. One must have to love someone very much to choose to call them their child.\n\nUltimately, you have to decide for yourself whether you want to forgive your mother. If you choose not to, I'm not sure anyone here would blame you, including myself. However, if not forgiving her is going to hurt you as much as it hurts anyone else, then maybe that isn't what is best for you. \n\nSo many people on this sub think it so easy to just write someone out of your life when they wrong you, but hatred and begrudgement is a double-edged sword, and the pain we do to others, we also do to ourselves.\n\nI wish you well in navigating this and encourage you to have a long conversation with your parents about why you feel hurt and betrayed and how it can be fixed going forward.", "NTA - don\u2019t feel an imposter. The Chippewa are your heritage.  You have plenty of time to learn from them. Don\u2019t blame you, your mother blatantly lied to you for years.  Parents can\u2019t bury secrets like they used, DNA testing is easy to do.  Enjoy learning your heritage. Don\u2019t be standoffish when you meet them, be yourself.  Congrats on having the bravery to get the answers you were seeking.", "NTA Look, as an indigenous person, being cut off from your native heritage and forced to only learn white culture, while at the same time being met with profound racism (being called Mowgli is good natured, really?) is about the most typical indigenous story of the last 200 years. All over the world, huge groups of native peoples have had the exact same experience of being denied their culture as you. You could almost say you are the norm, rather than the outlier.\n\nAll this to say that you have every right to feel like you belong, and if you talk to people at the reservation, they can probably tell you story after story of friends and relatives who were also denied their culture in childhood. You are not alone!", "If this wasn\u2019t here it would have taken all of my inner strength to not say it.", "I appreciate the suggestion! I\u2019m familiar with the All My Relations podcast \u2014 I\u2019ll look for those specific topics. Cheers!", "My wife and her brother are half-Filipino, half-white, and growing up in California **everyone** assumed they spoke Spanish.", "I'm mixed, but was cut off from my mother's culture in favour of being raised in the Caucasian world. I understand the fears and we have a term used for those of us who are of descent but not culturally raised. \"Plastic\"\nAt the end of the day, if your new family is going to embrace you and teach you about your culture, you will catch up and forge an identity that mixes both worlds, will be unique to you. Build trust, then get immersed.", "NTA.  Your Mom lied to you and denied you the opportunity to learn about your own culture and heritage for your entire life, to the point that you are conditioned to feel like an imposter not only with your white family, but also with your indigenous one.  The \u201cMowgli\u201d nickname is racist and ignorant, not \u201cgood-natured\u201d and so is your friend\u2019s comment about \u201cbrown on the outside and white on the inside.\u201d  \n\nYou absolutely deserve to explore and learn about your Chippewa heritage.  Since you have cousins that are excited about introducing you to your heritage, throw yourself in and immerse yourself; learn everything they offer to teach you.  It will help you feel more comfortable and establish a sense of belonging.  It was stolen from you by your mother and any feelings you may have about feeling like you are an imposter or don\u2019t deserve to be a part of that community are the result of your mother\u2019s selfish desire to protect her own ass rather than care about your mental and emotional well-being.  Her repeatedly refusing to answer questions about your lineage was calculated and deliberate, and I\u2019m genuinely sorry that you had to wait so long to get any answers.  \n\nForgive and have sympathy for your mom, if you want to, but I also encourage you to maybe look into counseling to help you sort out your feelings regarding what your mom did by lying to you.  Counseling may also help you to put things into perspective and give you strategies to help deal with you feelings of imposter syndrome.", "You\u2019re never too old to start learning about your culture! Just be kind with yourself when you have doubts. Remind yourself by saying \u201cI\u2019m still learning\u201d and accept it will take time for the displacement to morph into comfort.\n\nNTA", "D\u00e1anzho!\n\nDefinitely NTA. Take your time and discover your identity. If you want to learn about your native culture, ceremonies, regalia\u2026 do it. You deserve it. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t feel pressure about forgiving your mom until you are ready. That is your choice. It\u2019s understandable why you would be upset. The situation your mom put you in, set you up for an cultural identity crisis.\n\nI wish you health, happiness and luck on your journey.", "NTA sometimes you need to distance yourself to heal properly, its all natural.\nJust a doubt, where does you father stand in all this? Since when did he knew you was an affair baby, and did he dumped your mom when he found out, like they are still together? \nI would just be carefull on getting closer to your native family, you can hurt your dad deeply if you start to call your bio-dad dad and distance yourself from him, that would be my only concearn.", "That is definitely validating (unfortunately, haha) \u2014 and you\u2019re right, there was a strange irony of being denied heritage while simultaneously being given nicknames like Mowgli. \n\nThe stories thing is already happening! In that way, it\u2019s an exciting time.", "Thanks for your comment, I appreciate it! \n\nTo offer a few answers: I would have had the tools to learn what I\u2019m now learning (language and arts, for example) at an earlier age \u2014 given it was something I yearned for, I know I would have taken the opportunity as early as it was made available to me instead of years of uncertainty. The thing is that I DID know my bio father was native (after some brief confusion over being called Mexican) just not his specific background and so forth. My racial mix was clear, but it was \u201chush hush.\u201d\n\nI also would have been able to connect with my cousins in the way I finally am now. Really, it should have been my choice to act (or not act) on that information. Just as connecting with them now at 21 doesn\u2019t discount my relationship with my other family members, it wouldn\u2019t have ten years ago, either. I actually have two paternal cousins who were adopted at birth since my paternal aunt couldn\u2019t take care of them, and I recently met their adoptive mom. She made sure they knew their heritage from a young age while supporting them, and I think that made a big difference when I \u201ccompare\u201d myself.\n\nI agree with you about the part about my dad and that bond; that\u2019s not up for debate, yes. I myself will likely adopt (I\u2019m gay) rather than have a biological kid. My kid will both have access to their full identity while also being assured that I love them wholeheartedly as their father. I think both can exist together, and a kid deserves transparency (especially when it comes to their identity). If my kid has a different background than me, I will make sure they at least have an open door to explore their heritage while knowing that I stand behind them.\n\nI do understand the complications on my mom\u2019s side, but still stand for what I deserved to know. Healing is definitely possible and I\u2019m optimistic, but it\u2019s certainly a journey that will take time. Thank you! \ud83e\udef6"]}
