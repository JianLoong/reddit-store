I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?", "created_utc": 1681241613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iuu1t/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_if_they_wont/", "score": 1907, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their romantic relationship with each other is over, and it is time to accept that.

They agree on what is best for you and even plan to get therapy for all of you.

There are so many children of divorce out there who can\u2019t say the same. Knowing the full story straight away in no way, shape or form makes up for losing not just the life you\u2019re used to but even one of your parents *by their own choice*. \n\nYou will find out down the line anyway but right now, the only one behaving AHish is you.

YOU need to listen to your school counselors advice on this.", "Soft YTA because while you\u2019re still a kid, and this is hard for you, I think you\u2019re acting a bit entitled and kinda mean for actively trying to hurt your parents.

Maybe this is a learning opportunity to gain some empathy for your parents and to understand that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you (sorry if that\u2019s harsh).\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is hard for you; my parents were separated and/or divorced for most of my childhood, and it was honestly much better for them to be apart than together and miserable.", "Soft YTA your counselor is right you shouldn't be playing them against each other. You can hold firm about wanting more details, but your parents are also allowed a right to keep things private. I think you also need to give them time to process all the emotions of them going through a divorce. I think they are trying to give you as much information as they can handle you knowing.", "YTA Maybe there is a reason, maybe they really did just fall out of love. You are making the whole situation more difficult than it needs to be. You should ask them to get you a therapist so you can deal with this better.", "Soft YTA, just because you haven't been told does not mean anyone's at fault. Your mom moved out, maybe your father the only one's one the deed?   \nIt could be ANYTHING, cheating is not the only reasons parents split.   \nThey can split for a number of reasons!

You have the right to question EVERYTHING. But they might not have all the words for it.   \n***You have the right to feel grief, sadness, anger, even hate, but you need to wait a bit for the hate.***   \n\n\nThey haven't divorced because of malice or to hurt you, they have divorced because they cant function with themselves.", "YTA.  Your parents are being responsible adults by not pulling you into their drama.  Trust me, knowing the full details will do you no favors, as it will only give you someone to blame and alienate you from one or both parents.  Divorces happen, accept it and move on.", "Tbh I was in a similar situation. I was 15 when my parents started acting weird. I thought my dad was getting black mailed lol. Then Saturday night my dad left in a huff. I went up and asked my mom and she straight up told me my dad had an affair. After that she used me as her own personal therapist and it demolished the view I had of my dad, we\u2019re okay now, just took years of therapy. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to know, even if you really want to know. But I acted the same way you acted, threatening to parents to get your way. You\u2019re experiencing your own trauma in regards to this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH tho. Just remember ignorance can be bliss.", "YTA my friend.\n\nYour parents are both being very mature, and keeping their adult problems out of their kids life like they should. People get divorced for a lot of reasons, it\u2019s usually not some big thing. And even if something big did happened, they don\u2019t have to tell you. They are also entitled to privacy, even from you.\n\nWhat they DO owe you is clarity about what this means for you and your family. they owe it it to you to be respectful coparents with eachother and both be there for you. But they do not owe you whatever private thing they don\u2019t want to share.", "Dear OP, \n\nI don\u2019t want to call anyone TA here, because this is just overall a very shitty situation.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you, and that they sprung it on you like this.\n\nPersonally I think they might have thought it would be better for you this way, to come home to your mom already moved out, so you wouldn\u2019t have to witness the process. I\u2019m not saying what they did is right, but I think they were trying.\n\nI absolutely get that you want answers, but when a relationship ends there isn\u2019t always one clear reason why it ended, sometimes the truth is just \u201cWe tried everything, but we couldn\u2019t make it work.\u201d And as sad as it is, people do fall out of love. Relationships are hard work, and sometimes we forget to put in the work, and they fall apart. Or sometimes we do everything we can, and they still fall apart. \n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you want someone to blame, but adult relationships aren\u2019t always black and white, it\u2019s not always \u201cwe were super happy and everything was perfect and then one of us cheated and now everything is shit\u201d. One of them may have cheated, but even then it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re the sole reason for the breakup. In a decade long relationship realistically both partners have made mistakes and hurt the other one. \n\nI honestly think they\u2019re doing their best in this complex and complicated situation to hurt you as little as possible. Try to give them some time to come to terms with it themselves, they also have to adjust to their new reality, and they are dealing with a lot of emotions too. Please understand that they\u2019re trying to protect you by not putting you into the middle of their relationship drama. They\u2019re trying to work it out amongst themselves first, instead of putting all their fresh emotions on you, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nI really think going to therapy alone on top of going to family therapy would be good for you. You understandably have a lot of anger, and other emotions, and therapy can help you deal with that.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll be able to navigate this and deal with it, and I really wish you all the best", "YTA, anybody who says they are going to \u201cyeet their parents\u201d is still too emotionally immature to handle the private details of their parents divorce.", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it sucks to hear this, but I'll tell you this as someone who came from the same situation (parents divorced when I was a teenager, and while I saw it coming from a while away, I was told very last second, matter-of-fact that they had already divorced when I came home during a school break):\n\nPeople fall out of love. It can happen over time or it can be something that someone notices one day. Either way, they are trying their best to be there for you from the sound of it, but they are still humans who need time to process things. They might tell you the details in the future when they might be ready, or they might not. At the end of the day, you're not entitled to know 100% and you probably never will, but that doesn't mean you can go blaming them or making it primarily about you. Your parents are still people, and this is a significant life change for them as much as it is for you.", "Giving you a gentle YTA because you are 14 years old and have no idea what makes an adult relationship/marriage work. I\u2019m sorry that your parents are divorcing and I am sorry that this will affect your life. You have the right to be upset, but what you\u2019re doing is cruel and extremely immature. In time I\u2019m sure maybe your parents will tell you what went on to lead to this. But trust that by the way they are handling this they only want what is best for EVERYONE. People grow apart. People change. That is simply a fact of life. If you are this angry, might I suggest asking your parents to assist you with finding a therapist that you can process this with if you don\u2019t want to talk to your parents. The wound is super fresh right now for your parents. Give it time.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA. You are too young to understand this, but sometimes grownups have reasons for things that their kids don\u2019t need to know about. Sure, infidelity could be the issue. So could abuse, or a dead bedroom, or financial issues, or one of them is gay, or one of them is having a midlife crisis. Or they grew apart and don\u2019t love each other anymore and are making a really hard decision. Maybe they have been \u201cshady\u201d because they were trying to hide that they were going to therapy to try to work things out. Pitting them against each other when they are trying to be reasonable and co-parent is really awful and unfair to all of you. Work with the therapist, be active and participate. You very clearly have feelings you need to work through. I know this is hard, but it\u2019s hard for them too and you acting like this is making it harder for everyone.", "I won\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole because you\u2019re a literal child. So immature behavior and an inability to handle emotional matters with sensitivity is not exactly your fault. Compassion and decency probably ought to be something a 14 year old can have, though, and you do seem to lack both. I\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t a reverse custody battle here. I\u2019ve never been happier to be child free. What a nightmare.", "I feel like this is a very light YTA, because even though you may not want to hear it, \"We just don't love each other anymore\" is very well a full reason. People DO fall out of love, and if you'd seen it coming, then it's obvious there was tension between them already. They're going thru something on their own, the world doesn't revolve around you and your explanations, and you can't pin your living situation based on your own thoughts, you're blaming innocent people for your own thoughts.", "My parents divorced when I was about 1\u20133 years old. I only found out why they did once I turned 18. Your parents just divorced, and you need to give them time to settle in their new lives. There's nothing wrong with making it clear that eventually, years down the line, you'd like to know what happened. Forcing it now, however, by turning them against one another even more than they already are is a terrible move.\n\nYTA, be patient and focus on yourself and your own well-being during this time.", "Sorry OP. \n\nYTA and you sound like a brat. I understand that you are shocked and hurt by their announcement, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to force them to air their dirty laundry in front of you. They are adults and you\u2019re not. They are doing their best to be civil with one another in front of you and you\u2019re just stirring the pot. \n\nYour attitude towards your parents shows that your maturity level just isn\u2019t there, and you probably will react poorly to whatever the truth is. \n\n10 years from now you will probably (hopefully) realize that you overreacted. For now, continue getting therapy to deal with the divorce and try to respect your parents right to privacy.", "I'm sorry your having to deal with this, but the reality is that some times the answers to these questions are not simple or black and white.\n\nMaybe the cliche of they fell out of love is the answer, but it took them a while to realize it was time to call it quits.\n\nMaybe something specific did happen like you suspect but neither of them are fully innocent or they are too ashamed to discuss it.\n\nIn many cases the ultimate trigger may indeed be something that for your own good, for whatever reason, you truly shouldn't be told yet.", "Relationships are hard work especially for one that lasted 20 years. A relationship breaking down can be no one's fault they could of just stopped being in love with eachother which is a common reason as people change. This divorce is probably hurting both of them let them tell you when they are ready to buy not now when it just happened as they need time to process everything and work on moving forward. Keep talking to your school counselor and continue to get support but don't make it any more difficult than it is already for your parents.", "I'm going with YTA specifically because of exactly what your counselor said.  You're trying to play them off each other.  If it wasn't for that I'd go with N A H because I get why you want to know but I think your parents are doing the correct thing by not telling you.  What happened happened between *them*, and even though it affects you, it is better to have your relationships with them going forward based off of you and them rather than anything that happened between them.  And FYI people just do stop loving each other for no big reason, happens all the time.", "They agreed to keep the details quiet so that they could jointly parent the affected child (you) in the least disruptive way.\r  \n\r  \nYou feel things have already been disrupted and want the facts.

That's their business.  What you need to know is that they are divorcing and what's going to happen next.\n\nI get that you want somebody to blame, but just because you want that doesn't mean you're entitled to know.

Do you generally doubt their judgment, or just in this situation? \n\nI am wondering if there\u2019s a reason that you\u2019re so certain that there has to be a villain and a hero. From your post and comments, it seems that you are a fairly black and white thinker, which makes sense for a 14-year-old. Relationships are rarely so clear, though, which is why I\u2019m wondering if they have set a standard that makes it hard for you to trust them on this.\n\nAlso, I came back from a year living abroad for my junior year of high school to find that my parents had split and my mom had already moved across the country. I get why you want an explanation, but the reality as far as I can see is that you have one. People absolutely stop loving each other. That said, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re hurting. It truly sucks.", "Yeah, YTA. Relationships fall apart for all kinds of reasons. And yes, people literally do just fall out of love \u201cfor no reason.\u201d You will understand that one day too. They don\u2019t owe you an explanation. It\u2019s literally just between them. \n\nBe grateful that you never saw them scream at each other or physically harm one another. Be grateful your family never had to call the police to your home because they were being violent and scared for their safety and yours. Be grateful that your parents aren\u2019t using you as a pawn or trying to pit you against each other. \n\nBe fucking grateful that they\u2019re seemingly being civil about this and stop giving them more hardship than they\u2019re already having to deal with. Be grateful that they love you and stop being a brat. You could have it so much worse. I went through worse myself as a kid much younger than you. I would have given anything for my parents to just speak rationally instead of fight like fucking savages and try to manipulate me and each other. \n\nOne day you will learn more about what\u2019s happened. When wounds have healed and a new normal has been worked out. But right now, you don\u2019t need to know. Believe me when I say that it doesn\u2019t matter. The marriage is over and you need to accept that your life is going to change now, and I\u2019m sure your parents are full of regret about that as it is.

(I still wish I knew now as much as I did at that age)  I assure you, you are not.  There are adult conversations and there are children conversations.  \n\nThis being said even an adult child does not need to know the intimate parts of a parents relationship with any adult.  \n\nIn addition, just so you can start to see what you really don't know.  People can grow apart, they can just no longer feel it and don't want to put the effort forward that is required to maintain a relationship.  Most marriages do not end because one partner has cheated or changed teams.  I mean some do but not the majority.  Adult relationships are complex.  Oh boy do I wish they were as simple as when I was 14....  movie style love..\n\nIt sucks I get it.  But the only information you are entitled to is information as it relates to you.  Examples, your parents still love you, where you are going to staying, how frequently you will see which parent and when.", "Let\u2019s just put AHery aside for this one. Neither. \n\nYou are VERY understandably grieving, unnerved, and angry about this major disruption to your family. Your home life is changing forever. You have no power to stop it. Your big feelings about this are so valid. Divorce for children is mega traumatic. \n\nPlease understand that your parents are doing the very best thing for you by not disclosing their reasons. You are 14, you should not be burdened unnecessarily by adult problems. They are giving you a gift by keeping you out of their problems. It sucks, but you do not need to know reasons. You do not need to understand why. \n\nPlease respect their excellent parenting and boundaries in this regard by not pushing them. \n\nI was 14 when my parents divorced and I wanted to know too. They wouldn\u2019t tell me, as is correct. Through the years though, with adulthood and more experience, things clarified for me.

I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My instinct, as a parent, is to protect my child and that sometimes leads me to make decisions based on that premise, rather than a premise of being open with my child. My child is their own person with very valid emotions and opinions and I am forging a relationship with them that is ever changing as they grow. When they ask me questions I (1) dont want to answer, and (2)  think the answer to will hurt, I explain that.\n\nMaybe your parents are acting out of that instinct to protect, I dont know.

I would also demand to know what happened (even in broad terms, assuming it\u2019s an \u201cembarrassing\u201d reason) before deciding what the living arrangements would be.  At 14, you definitely should get to make an informed choice about what\u2019s actually going on.

I would feel awful if one of my parents cheated on the other and I was forced to live with the one who cheated - regardless of whether the other parent forgave them.  They cheated on our family.

Being upfront and allowing OP to process and then maybe rebuild a relationship is the right thing.

This is a very difficult time for both you and your parents. You are still a child and when you are young it is really really difficult to understand that the world does not exist in black and white. Your thinking is very rigid and inflexible. You are looking for a villain when there may not be one. Families and marriages are complex, and you will understand that the dynamics between adults can be not so clear cut. The bottom line is your parents love you and care for you. They are having a really difficult time now too. You need to take some deep breaths and find a trusted adult to speak with, such as a school psychologist, counselor, or social worker and express your feelings. The value of having parents who care for you is immense and you will deeply regret fighting them at every turn as you get older. I promise you.", "I\u2019m torn between NTA and ESH. First off, I\u2019m sorry that this is the way your parents decided to tell you about their divorce. I can\u2019t imagine how blind sighted I\u2019d be coming from a vacation to an entirely different home life. That\u2019s rough and it makes sense that you\u2019d angrily lash out and assume someone is at fault. Sometimes no one is \u201cat fault,\u201d but I also get that you still want more information from your parents. I think you and parents need to sit down and have another conversation where it isn\u2019t all so raw (I think it was a terrible idea to confront you having just gotten in from a trip and it\u2019s a big reason why I can\u2019t say YTA). Tell them how you\u2019re feeling and be honest. From your comments I can tell you\u2019re angry and your anger is valid, but it\u2019s not fair to take that anger and make it everyone else\u2019s problem by throwing out hurtful accusations. Good luck.", "Your feelings are very valid. I think a lot of people who would have a knee-jerk reaction to act the way you\u2019re acting. But it doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. It really sucks having to sit with discomfort and the unknown. And the amount of discomfort and unknown factors is a lot for someone your age. You are not an asshole and neither are your parents. The way they are handling the situation shows that they are doing everything in their power to ensure you still have a relationship with both of them. Which shows how much they care about you. Their divorce is not your fault and the way marriages fall apart can be very complicated. If cheating was involved, based on how your parents are handling it, I\u2019m gonna guess that it wasn\u2019t done in a way that made it a transgression worthy of lifetime banishment. At least in their eyes. I know that when everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, it can feel good to hit the self-destruct button. But if you do, you will regret it later. This is not an issue you should bring to Reddit, you should be talking to a therapist about it.", "Agreed. And to add to this too, if OP\u2019s parents have been acting strangely \u201cfor awhile,\u201d then this trip with the grandparents may have been strategically planned to get her out of the house so they could settle the logistics privately. Or, even if purely coincidental in timing, the opportunity could have been the same.", "This. OP,  please read this post.

It\u2019s about making an informed decision of who she wants to be with and without all the info she can\u2019t make an informed decision. Now if it truly is just they fell out of love due to problems left unsolved or unsaid in their marriage they can just say that and op would probably take that as an answer but saying just fell out of love that\u2019s not how life works it\u2019s a series of events. \n\nI mean personally if I was told my mom cheated and that\u2019s why my dad left I would be pissed  because I feel cheating shows your character especially if it\u2019s an affair because it shows your true colors and morals which is fucked up. And wanting to make sure someone who has questionable morals or they are untrustworthy isn\u2019t wrong when they are in charge of raising a human being. \n \nThis is my feelings but if given new info or new perspective I hadn\u2019t thought of I could change it but to me I Don\u2019t see why op wanting to be told the truth so they can know what to do or feel isn\u2019t a bad thing.

They maintained a friendship until very recently but they\u2019re still civil. They\u2019ve both been able to be present for their children\u2019s graduations, accomplishments, special occasions, my husband\u2019s wedding, etc etc, because of their friendship.

It\u2019s the only reason she really knows who Grandpa is. \n\nMy point in sharing all this is - there doesn\u2019t always have to be a bad guy and as the child in the scenario, you shouldn\u2019t want there to be. I understand being angry and confused and wanting an explanation\u2026but your parents are trying to give you a gift of not having to choose between them.

But honestly you are not entitled to the inner workings of their relationship, and you may find out things you wish you didn't know.\n\nLike how would you feel if they shared the reason and you realized \"oh, so my parent has a sexual kink that is going unmet, wow, didn't need to know that.\" \n\nGo to therapy to process this life change and let your parents deal with it.

As an adult, I understand the world is much more complex than that. As I child, the answer \"NO\" was a full sentence and \"because I said so\" was the only reason I was entitled to. That pissed me off. As an parent, I offer explanations as often as possible. But sometimes, I just can't explain. Fortunately, my teen can accept that. Marriage is not the simple black and white thing you're making it out to be. You're being a jerk, but only because you lack the life experience to understand. You're never entitled to an explanation on this. No one is. My parents showed up every day and worked hard to give me a good life. As an adult, I strive to be a much like my mom as humanly possible. I hope you can find a way to move past this anger. Sometimes stuff just sucks, and this is one of those times.

On any other post lying is almost always said to be unacceptable in any form by commenters but here it\u2019s appropriate??  I understand different situations are cause for different solutions but here not so.  Sometimes we need to put ourselves in the OP\u2019s shoes and I would almost bet that any commenter if faced with the same would want to know why there parents are breaking up and of one cheater bc it would and should impact how they feel, how they view each parent, who they live with, and who they interact with.\n\nP.S. To the commenters saying she doesn\u2019t understand the complexities  of marriage that is probably true, however this is the time for her parents to teach her emotional intelligence, understanding on a deeper level, and possibly that things aren\u2019t always black and white.", "At the same time, she might decide to live with the cheater, only to find they are moving their affair partner, 5 step kids, and an evil step grandma in. Or she might bring her friends over after school only to find her mom being spit roasted by a couple guys young enough to be Ops older brothers. Chances of either happening,  probably low,  but you can't say nothing is changing  either. I agree that pitting them against each other night not be the right play,  but I think at 14, she deserves some idea of the choice she's making", "I disagree, if a parent cheats I think the kid should know, there's gonna be a lot of people that say that cheaters can be good parents, I vehemently disagree with that, the moment you put your fun, lust or need for a romantic connection before your kid, that makes you a bad parent and an asshole, OP deserves to know if someone is ruining his family, who it is.", "Oh dear, you hit the nail on the head. \nHope OP will consider these words.", "Ngl when my parents divorced it wasnt rocket science to figure out it was because my dad cheated as he got married 3 months laterl, and them trying to sugar coat it and be like \"people fall out of love\" made the discovery even more gross.", "Right? Back in school, so many of my friends with divorced parents knew the reason for the divorce and nearly all of them **internalized** that reason (essentially, they blamed themselves/took on the blame). Even when the reason had zero to do with them, they'd still blame themselves.\n\nThese parents decided to spare their kid that emotional baggage - even if she's not directly the problem, so many kids internalize/blame themselvees for crap like that - and she's essentially bullying/manipulating them like it's a game to her. Because she's convinced she 'deserves to know.'", "It is unreasonable. The reasons couples divorce is usually very personal and there is a lot of hurt and grief for the couple (of course there is too for the child). She doesn\u2019t need to know the intimate details of her parents marriage. The way she\u2019s acting is making things way worse.", "I can\u2019t understand people calling a 14yr old a T A for wanting to know why her family is being torn apart. All these big excuses people have for breaking their families apart. Sad. OP is NTA.", "honestly i think the answer is probably both sadder and more boring than whatever you\u2019re imagining. people really do fall out of love. \n\nnow let me say, in general, the way we treat children and teens is just wild. can\u2019t choose where or even who you live with, a lot of relationships forced on you and sometimes then yanked away, forced to go to school, have to ask to go to the bathroom, etc etc. so it is quite a blow to have this massive change thrust upon you with no say at all. and it makes complete sense that you would want to have all the information you can in order to process it. but even though we can and should improve the way we treat our youth generally, this is hard situation that will always be an inherent risk of having children/being a child/just being a part of a human family. connections can break and since a family is connected in many ways, they affect people who aren\u2019t even involved. it\u2019s just going to suck, no matter what anyone does. as hard as it is, your parents are actually doing the best thing in this situation. so while your reaction is completely understandable, wildly trying to grasp at reasons to stitch together something you can understand, there\u2019s not going to be any information you can learn that will enable you to do that. even if there is a single thing you could learn to make up your mind, you still won\u2019t really understand. who can ever understand? \n\nso while i don\u2019t doubt you are capable of berating them into telling you more about their divorce, i really don\u2019t think you should. it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s an easy narrative you could latch onto for a while, but since they both seem to be caring people, it\u2019s definitely more complicated than that. i think most likely though, if they give you more information it will be, yeah, boring and sad. im sorry you have to go through this. it\u2019s not fair that this is happening to you. but more information really isn\u2019t going to help", "Sure, I'll play along. Say you stay with grandma. Yeah, she said you can stay with her ***for the time being***, ***until things settled down,*** but is that fair to her that you now expect it for the next 4+ years?\n\nYour parents may have a legal obligation to pay for your food and clothing *right now,* because you're a minor, but let's think this out. Who's paying for the extras that *aren't* required, like school trips? Birthday parties? Your cell phone bill? Driving lessons?\n\nWho's taking you to the doctor from now on? Who's driving you to your friends' houses and taking you to and from school?\n\nWhat about college? Your parents are dead to you, so you don't expect any money from them once your turn eighteen, right? Even with great grades, extracurriculars, etc, getting a full ride is not easy or guaranteed. Who's going to cosign your loans in that case? Not mom, right, since you're yeeting her? Not dad? Do you want grandma to foot the bill? Is that fair?\n\nYou're hurt and I get that, but they are not obligated to tell you more than what they've said so far. *You are not owed the intimate details of their relationship.*", "OP is grieving and is currently in the \"anger\" stage.  Give her a break.", "She is not. She still has 11 more years of brain development before it\u2019s done. Even if they told her the reason, she can\u2019t quite understand it. Them being kosher and tight lipped about exact reasons is what it should be. She can learn all the details when she\u2019s an adult.", "I'm with you. My parents also divorced, and I was younger than OP. I was told that my mom was unhappy and didn't love my dad anymore. \n\nMy dad, however, sat me down at 12 and told me that if mom went through with the divorce he never wanted to see me or my brother again. \n\nOne way was the right way to handle it. One way was the very wrong way to handle it and it gave me some pretty serious emotional scars. Made those scars even worse when my dad followed through and refused to see us for the next decade. \n\nThere's an age-appropriate way to tell OP what happened to make her family fall apart. Their refusing to discuss it, honestly, makes me feel like someone *did* cheat.", "My kids don't ever need to know why their dad and I divorced, he and I both fucked up in many ways. But we have done everything in our power to be good coparents and make sure they are happy, loved, and disrupted as little aa possible. Because ultimately, no matter what actions happened they were a result of us just not being healthy for eachother after 15 years and getting together at 18. We were different people by our 30s and those people were no longer compatible and it became toxic.  The actions are shitty, but they arenot anything the kids need to know because actions are usually the results of build ups over time and many many small things snowballing. It's not something easily understood by kids, teens, or even young adults. It takes life experiences to understand how it all intertwines.\n\nYour loss of trust in your parents for not knowing all the details is something you need to work through. You are not entitled to that information, but you are entitled to having parents do everything in their power to give you a good life.... even when that means they separate so they canbe happier and healthier to do so for you", "But what if it\u2019s something really personal- like they aren\u2019t sexually attracted to one another any more or something like that? Do you really want to know that? How much is appropriate to tell kids?", "So relieved to see both your comments! \n\nI was feeling guilty in thinking that OP certainly wasn't alleviating any troubles the marriage might have had. \nI mean, I know psychologists describe that as a child's strategy: if they fight me/ over me, they can't fight each other... but seeing it in action is something else.", "Or could be summed up as, \"we just don't love each other anymore.\"\n\nCould be that it's a bunch of little things that OP wouldn't see as acceptable reasons but those little things add up to \"we no longer work as a couple, we can probably have a civil co-parenting relationship if we divorce *now* but this relationship is straining at the seams and if we keep trying to 'make things work' there ***will*** be massive drama.\"", "Or you had happy home privilege? I'm in my 30s now, wanted to literally murder my father before I hit double digits.", "Right? OP didn't get a choice in being born. OP didn't get a choice in who her parents are. OP didn't get a choice in the divorce.\n\nIf they don't want to talk, then OP is finally free to *choose* to assume the worst. Parents don't like that? Well maybe they should be honest.", "You are choosing to throw away anyone who even potentially did a bad thing. Your prerogative but if you keep this up you will be a very lonely person through your life. No matter who is technically at fault here you are choosing to ruin your relationship with both of your parents. Congrats kid.", "I agree with all your statements. See now that you have gone through some things you have an understanding of how complex relationships and people really are. Honestly this is a hot take but that is something that is lost on most until mid to late 20s simply because they haven't lived much life. Not saying they haven't had life  incidents just not experience if that makes sense. I agree that the parents are doing the right thing. To be honest I don't think at any point the parents owe an explanation about what went on in their relationship.", "Maybe she'll realize how childish she's acting and be better.", "I am so so sorry that happened to you.", "But the gory details are not required. We became different people and found out that we no longer want the same things in life and or no longer get along well is fine. OP did not even get that. Just got \"Welcome home. Mom lives somewhere else now and we are getting divorced\". I think asking for any small explanation is fair.", "We find that we are no longer compatible in fundamental important ways. Done. No weird innapropriate stuff.", "To quote Esther Perel, \"the victim of the affair is not necessarily the victim of the relationship.\"\n\nNot that that point of view is popular on reddit, where people want to believe things are black-and-white and many redditors are young enough with happy enough lives (and good for them!) that they have trouble imagining something worse than being cheated on.", "I have a lot of sympathy for OP, genuinely, it must be extraordinarily rough in this day and age to be a teenager. I give kudos to parents who can handle the horrible things teenagers say and do - I simply could not. \n\nIf my kid did this when I'm already enduring a marriage of two decades ending, I'd be devastated. It's normal for a kid to lash out, but the degree of nastiness in her comments is something that would hurt me for life as her parent, and I would not handle it well. The ugly sides of parenting are often brushed aside and not everyone is capable of being a good parent during situations like this.\n\nI really hope it's just a front for reddit and she isn't saying these things to her parents. She needs therapy, ASAP.", "in what way is it appropriate to comment this where a 14 year old is going to see it?\n\nwhy do adults in this subreddit act so weird and callous when the poster is a literal kid?", "Yes. They deserve to know.", "That is a dysfunctional relationship and not good for the kids.", "That may be the case - but these are not just \u201cpeople messing with you\u201d. These are your parents, and they are flawed people (as all of us are) who clearly love you very much, even if they no longer love each other.", "It\u2019s none of your business. Do you tell your parents about your personal relationships?", "There's lying and hiding things, and there is not sharing private things. The two are not the same. The only two people who are entitled to know exactly what happened to your parents' relationship are your parents; it's private, and between them. Yes, obviously, it affects you, but their relationship with each other is only between them. I absolutely understand why you want to know, and I feel for you and am very sorry this is happening (and that some people here are being so unkind to you), but your parents are trying to do what is best for you in the long run. Literally every informed, knowledgeable person would advise any divorcing parents that they should absolutely not ever tell their children that one parent bears the blame for the divorce, even if it's true, because doing so would be deeply damaging to their children. I know it feels condescending as hell, but people here are right when they say that your black-and-white thinking is a function of your age, and you will grow out of it if you give yourself a chance to do so \u2013 and it would be tragic if you permanently damaged your relationship with one or both of your parents because, at 14, you simply weren't equipped to understand the nuances of adult romantic relationships.\n\nLike I said, I understand why you feel this burning need to know why, but it really will be better for you to let it go. I hope that you will.", "Lmao grow the hell up", "Thats not what they said tho. They said it's private", "Exactly! Id like to add that trying to manipulate the information out of their parents by leveraging their presence and love makes them the toxic one in this scenario.\nEdit- not maybe, that\u2019s literally what they\u2019re doing lol", "They are actually a child. Who is dealing with a major life crisis.", "Maybe you can express that her behavior is wrong without resorting to insulting and berating this kid where she can probably see it. Real mature and helpful of you.", "Gee, it\u2019s almost like a lot of people on Reddit aren\u2019t exactly well adjusted.", "I don\u2019t understand how people expect their kids to learn if no one talks to them about these things.", "But that's what op wants. To know who the bad guy is.\nI see your point. I do. From one adult to another. But as a parent to a child & or  teenager? Nope, nope nope. (Am one, personally ((parent to both actually)) \n\nWe can relay these things to our children as they grow and mature absolutely. But not when they demand it, and definitely not when it's in the midst of happening. \nThis is a very encumbersome topic with way too many variables and things you just dont see/understand until you're a bit more seasoned in life, OP is a very tender age yet..", "Obviously not but they at least let the kid know that they\u2019re having some issues but are trying to solve them. A reasonable solution would\u2019ve been  to goto to family counseling way sooner than the divorce where they discuss long term strategies and healthy ways to cope with something this life changing. \n\nAt 14 you shouldn\u2019t be treated like see no evil hear no evil. OP deserves a voice too and at least if it didn\u2019t work it\u2019s not straight out of nowhere.", "When you're a child, yes. When you're an adult and find out someone is not good for you, usually it's more founded than petty high school drama, but if it was a bullying situation and I mean like beating up people and intentionally harassing to hurt another then OP made the right choice to put distance between themselves and someone whose a thug.", "Yes if someone is acting this supremely immature and childish it's actually quite helpful and food for thought to know. If this is somehow too much to hear that you are acting like a toddler then op has larger problems", "well no.. but i don't think i'll ever get used to seeing such spiteful responses towards a child coming from people who are adults, in their 30s and 40s even. hard to wrap your mind around", ">Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon **so I can decide how I feel about it**. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or **\"we\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d** would help. \n\nBolded emphasis is mine. \n\nOP is a teenager trying to process her feelings about this. She's not trying to find the bad guy, she's trying to make sense of the world as her foundation cracks. If there is a bad guy, it's absolutely fair for OP to want to blame them, OP is a victim of this divorce as well. If there isn't a bad guy, then OP has the information necessary to discuss what happened, why, and then move on and build a healthier relationship with **both** parents. Children are so much more mature than we give them credit for.", "That kind of thinking is the reason my siblings ended up in abusive marriages.", "OP deserves a voice.  OP doesn\u2019t deserve to stomp all over their parents\u2019 boundaries.  Those are two different things.", "Clearly OP is managing her own actions. If they expect to spring a life changing decision on a 14 year old with zero expectations of resistance, then \"boundary\" meet consequences. OP deserves to know why her life is being uprooted. It's great to not bring kids into adult drama, but guess what, OP is in this drama and she wants information. She has every right to it", "OP isnt a child. OP is a teenager in high-school and is more than capable of deciding for themselves whether or not they want to continue a friendship with someone. OP said the ex-friend said \"super nasty and hurtful things\". This could be everything from basic name calling to straight up racism. Either way, OP is completely in their right to cut off toxic people.", "I agree that it makes sense to give her some info, but honestly, parents themselves still may be figuring out and processing themselves. They may know it\u2019s not working without really having had the insight or ability to unpack sufficiently to explain it to someone else, particularly someone with whom they want to explain it \u201cexactly right\u201d for fear of a shitty explanation damaging her, a parent/child relationship, etc.", "She already has decided how she feels about it. She is angry, that's fair! \n\nBe angry. You're still not equipped to start dissecting your parents' marriage at 10, 14, 16, hell even into their 20s for some -  likelihood of comprehension is very minimal.  \n\nI know all too well how *mature* kids are these days. And I give them credit where credit is due!

I could understand if OP were under 10, that's fine, but she's 14, she's (presumably) in high school. High school is the time when you have to start learning to deal with all your emotions. What better time is there than this? If they didn't want to discuss this with a moody teen, they should have waited to divorce, especially if it wasn't for some betrayal like cheating. \n\nLike I said before, we model our relationships on how we see the relationships of the adults around us.
