I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?", "created_utc": 1681241613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iuu1t/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_if_they_wont/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their romantic relationship with each other is over, and it is time to accept that.

YOU need to listen to your school counselors advice on this.", "Soft YTA because while you\u2019re still a kid, and this is hard for you, I think you\u2019re acting a bit entitled and kinda mean for actively trying to hurt your parents.

Maybe this is a learning opportunity to gain some empathy for your parents and to understand that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you (sorry if that\u2019s harsh).\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is hard for you; my parents were separated and/or divorced for most of my childhood, and it was honestly much better for them to be apart than together and miserable.", "Soft YTA your counselor is right you shouldn't be playing them against each other. You can hold firm about wanting more details, but your parents are also allowed a right to keep things private. I think you also need to give them time to process all the emotions of them going through a divorce. I think they are trying to give you as much information as they can handle you knowing.", "YTA Maybe there is a reason, maybe they really did just fall out of love.

You have the right to question EVERYTHING. But they might not have all the words for it.   \n***You have the right to feel grief, sadness, anger, even hate, but you need to wait a bit for the hate.***   \n\n\nThey haven't divorced because of malice or to hurt you, they have divorced because they cant function with themselves.", "YTA.  Your parents are being responsible adults by not pulling you into their drama.  Trust me, knowing the full details will do you no favors, as it will only give you someone to blame and alienate you from one or both parents.  Divorces happen, accept it and move on.", "Tbh I was in a similar situation. I was 15 when my parents started acting weird. I thought my dad was getting black mailed lol. Then Saturday night my dad left in a huff. I went up and asked my mom and she straight up told me my dad had an affair. After that she used me as her own personal therapist and it demolished the view I had of my dad, we\u2019re okay now, just took years of therapy. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to know, even if you really want to know. But I acted the same way you acted, threatening to parents to get your way. You\u2019re experiencing your own trauma in regards to this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH tho. Just remember ignorance can be bliss.", "YTA my friend.\n\nYour parents are both being very mature, and keeping their adult problems out of their kids life like they should. People get divorced for a lot of reasons, it\u2019s usually not some big thing. And even if something big did happened, they don\u2019t have to tell you. They are also entitled to privacy, even from you.\n\nWhat they DO owe you is clarity about what this means for you and your family. they owe it it to you to be respectful coparents with eachother and both be there for you. But they do not owe you whatever private thing they don\u2019t want to share.", "Dear OP, \n\nI don\u2019t want to call anyone TA here, because this is just overall a very shitty situation.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you, and that they sprung it on you like this.\n\nPersonally I think they might have thought it would be better for you this way, to come home to your mom already moved out, so you wouldn\u2019t have to witness the process. I\u2019m not saying what they did is right, but I think they were trying.\n\nI absolutely get that you want answers, but when a relationship ends there isn\u2019t always one clear reason why it ended, sometimes the truth is just \u201cWe tried everything, but we couldn\u2019t make it work.\u201d And as sad as it is, people do fall out of love. Relationships are hard work, and sometimes we forget to put in the work, and they fall apart. Or sometimes we do everything we can, and they still fall apart. \n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you want someone to blame, but adult relationships aren\u2019t always black and white, it\u2019s not always \u201cwe were super happy and everything was perfect and then one of us cheated and now everything is shit\u201d. One of them may have cheated, but even then it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re the sole reason for the breakup. In a decade long relationship realistically both partners have made mistakes and hurt the other one. \n\nI honestly think they\u2019re doing their best in this complex and complicated situation to hurt you as little as possible. Try to give them some time to come to terms with it themselves, they also have to adjust to their new reality, and they are dealing with a lot of emotions too. Please understand that they\u2019re trying to protect you by not putting you into the middle of their relationship drama. They\u2019re trying to work it out amongst themselves first, instead of putting all their fresh emotions on you, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nI really think going to therapy alone on top of going to family therapy would be good for you. You understandably have a lot of anger, and other emotions, and therapy can help you deal with that.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll be able to navigate this and deal with it, and I really wish you all the best", "YTA, anybody who says they are going to \u201cyeet their parents\u201d is still too emotionally immature to handle the private details of their parents divorce.", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it sucks to hear this, but I'll tell you this as someone who came from the same situation (parents divorced when I was a teenager, and while I saw it coming from a while away, I was told very last second, matter-of-fact that they had already divorced when I came home during a school break):\n\nPeople fall out of love. It can happen over time or it can be something that someone notices one day. Either way, they are trying their best to be there for you from the sound of it, but they are still humans who need time to process things. They might tell you the details in the future when they might be ready, or they might not. At the end of the day, you're not entitled to know 100% and you probably never will, but that doesn't mean you can go blaming them or making it primarily about you. Your parents are still people, and this is a significant life change for them as much as it is for you.", "Giving you a gentle YTA because you are 14 years old and have no idea what makes an adult relationship/marriage work. I\u2019m sorry that your parents are divorcing and I am sorry that this will affect your life. You have the right to be upset, but what you\u2019re doing is cruel and extremely immature. In time I\u2019m sure maybe your parents will tell you what went on to lead to this. But trust that by the way they are handling this they only want what is best for EVERYONE. People grow apart. People change. That is simply a fact of life. If you are this angry, might I suggest asking your parents to assist you with finding a therapist that you can process this with if you don\u2019t want to talk to your parents. The wound is super fresh right now for your parents. Give it time.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA. You are too young to understand this, but sometimes grownups have reasons for things that their kids don\u2019t need to know about. Sure, infidelity could be the issue. So could abuse, or a dead bedroom, or financial issues, or one of them is gay, or one of them is having a midlife crisis. Or they grew apart and don\u2019t love each other anymore and are making a really hard decision. Maybe they have been \u201cshady\u201d because they were trying to hide that they were going to therapy to try to work things out. Pitting them against each other when they are trying to be reasonable and co-parent is really awful and unfair to all of you. Work with the therapist, be active and participate. You very clearly have feelings you need to work through. I know this is hard, but it\u2019s hard for them too and you acting like this is making it harder for everyone.", "I won\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole because you\u2019re a literal child. So immature behavior and an inability to handle emotional matters with sensitivity is not exactly your fault. Compassion and decency probably ought to be something a 14 year old can have, though, and you do seem to lack both. I\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t a reverse custody battle here. I\u2019ve never been happier to be child free. What a nightmare.", "I feel like this is a very light YTA, because even though you may not want to hear it, \"We just don't love each other anymore\" is very well a full reason. People DO fall out of love, and if you'd seen it coming, then it's obvious there was tension between them already. They're going thru something on their own, the world doesn't revolve around you and your explanations, and you can't pin your living situation based on your own thoughts, you're blaming innocent people for your own thoughts.", "My parents divorced when I was about 1\u20133 years old. I only found out why they did once I turned 18. Your parents just divorced, and you need to give them time to settle in their new lives. There's nothing wrong with making it clear that eventually, years down the line, you'd like to know what happened. Forcing it now, however, by turning them against one another even more than they already are is a terrible move.\n\nYTA, be patient and focus on yourself and your own well-being during this time.", "Sorry OP. \n\nYTA and you sound like a brat. I understand that you are shocked and hurt by their announcement, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to force them to air their dirty laundry in front of you. They are adults and you\u2019re not. They are doing their best to be civil with one another in front of you and you\u2019re just stirring the pot. \n\nYour attitude towards your parents shows that your maturity level just isn\u2019t there, and you probably will react poorly to whatever the truth is. \n\n10 years from now you will probably (hopefully) realize that you overreacted. For now, continue getting therapy to deal with the divorce and try to respect your parents right to privacy.", "I'm sorry your having to deal with this, but the reality is that some times the answers to these questions are not simple or black and white.\n\nMaybe the cliche of they fell out of love is the answer, but it took them a while to realize it was time to call it quits.\n\nMaybe something specific did happen like you suspect but neither of them are fully innocent or they are too ashamed to discuss it.\n\nIn many cases the ultimate trigger may indeed be something that for your own good, for whatever reason, you truly shouldn't be told yet.", "Relationships are hard work especially for one that lasted 20 years. A relationship breaking down can be no one's fault they could of just stopped being in love with eachother which is a common reason as people change.

Keep talking to your school counselor and continue to get support but don't make it any more difficult than it is already for your parents.", "I'm going with YTA specifically because of exactly what your counselor said.  You're trying to play them off each other.  If it wasn't for that I'd go with N A H because I get why you want to know but I think your parents are doing the correct thing by not telling you.  What happened happened between *them*, and even though it affects you, it is better to have your relationships with them going forward based off of you and them rather than anything that happened between them.

That's their business.  What you need to know is that they are divorcing and what's going to happen next.\n\nI get that you want somebody to blame, but just because you want that doesn't mean you're entitled to know.

Do you generally doubt their judgment, or just in this situation? \n\nI am wondering if there\u2019s a reason that you\u2019re so certain that there has to be a villain and a hero. From your post and comments, it seems that you are a fairly black and white thinker, which makes sense for a 14-year-old. Relationships are rarely so clear, though, which is why I\u2019m wondering if they have set a standard that makes it hard for you to trust them on this.\n\nAlso, I came back from a year living abroad for my junior year of high school to find that my parents had split and my mom had already moved across the country. I get why you want an explanation, but the reality as far as I can see is that you have one. People absolutely stop loving each other. That said, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re hurting. It truly sucks.", "Yeah, YTA. Relationships fall apart for all kinds of reasons. And yes, people literally do just fall out of love \u201cfor no reason.\u201d You will understand that one day too. They don\u2019t owe you an explanation. It\u2019s literally just between them. \n\nBe grateful that you never saw them scream at each other or physically harm one another. Be grateful your family never had to call the police to your home because they were being violent and scared for their safety and yours. Be grateful that your parents aren\u2019t using you as a pawn or trying to pit you against each other. \n\nBe fucking grateful that they\u2019re seemingly being civil about this and stop giving them more hardship than they\u2019re already having to deal with. Be grateful that they love you and stop being a brat. You could have it so much worse. I went through worse myself as a kid much younger than you. I would have given anything for my parents to just speak rationally instead of fight like fucking savages and try to manipulate me and each other. \n\nOne day you will learn more about what\u2019s happened. When wounds have healed and a new normal has been worked out. But right now, you don\u2019t need to know. Believe me when I say that it doesn\u2019t matter.

(I still wish I knew now as much as I did at that age)  I assure you, you are not.  There are adult conversations and there are children conversations.  \n\nThis being said even an adult child does not need to know the intimate parts of a parents relationship with any adult.  \n\nIn addition, just so you can start to see what you really don't know.  People can grow apart, they can just no longer feel it and don't want to put the effort forward that is required to maintain a relationship.  Most marriages do not end because one partner has cheated or changed teams.  I mean some do but not the majority.  Adult relationships are complex.  Oh boy do I wish they were as simple as when I was 14....  movie style love..\n\nIt sucks I get it.  But the only information you are entitled to is information as it relates to you.

You are 14, you should not be burdened unnecessarily by adult problems. They are giving you a gift by keep you out of their problems. It sucks, but you do need to know reasons.

I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My instinct, as a parent, is to protect my child and that sometimes leads me to make decisions based on that premise, rather than a premise of being open with my child. My child is their own person with very valid emotions and opinions and I am forging a relationship with them that is ever changing as they grow. When they ask me questions I (1) dont want to answer, and (2)  think the answer to will hurt, I explain that.\n\nMaybe your parents are acting out of that instinct to protect, I dont know.

I would also demand to know what happened (even in broad terms, assuming it\u2019s an \u201cembarrassing\u201d reason) before deciding what the living arrangements would be.  At 14, you definitely should get to make an informed choice about what\u2019s actually going on.

I would feel awful if one of my parents cheated on the other and I was forced to live with the one who cheated - regardless of whether the other parent forgave them.  They cheated on our family.

Being upfront and allowing OP to process and then maybe rebuild a relationship is the right thing.

This is a very difficult time for both you and your parents. You are still a child and when you are young it is really really difficult to understand that the world does not exist in black and white. Your thinking is very rigid and inflexible. You are looking for a villain when there may not be one. Families and marriages are complex, and you will understand that the dynamics between adults can be not so clear cut. The bottom line is your parents love you and care for you. They are having a really difficult time now too. You need to take some deep breaths and find a trusted adult to speak with, such as a school psychologist, counselor, or social worker and express your feelings. The value of having parents who care for you is immense and you will deeply regret fighting them at every turn as you get older. I promise you.", "I\u2019m torn between NTA and ESH. First off, I\u2019m sorry that this is the way your parents decided to tell you about their divorce. I can\u2019t imagine how blind sighted I\u2019d be coming from a vacation to an entirely different home life. That\u2019s rough and it makes sense that you\u2019d angrily lash out and assume someone is at fault. Sometimes no one is \u201cat fault,\u201d but I also get that you still want more information from your parents. I think you and parents need to sit down and have another conversation where it isn\u2019t all so raw (I think it was a terrible idea to confront you having just gotten in from a trip and it\u2019s a big reason why I can\u2019t say YTA). Tell them how you\u2019re feeling and be honest. From your comments I can tell you\u2019re angry and your anger is valid, but it\u2019s not fair to take that anger and make it everyone else\u2019s problem by throwing out hurtful accusations. Good luck.", "Your feelings are very valid. I think a lot of people who would have a knee-jerk reaction to act the way you\u2019re acting. But it doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. It really sucks having to sit with discomfort and the unknown. And the amount of discomfort and unknown factors is a lot for someone your age. You are not an asshole and neither are your parents. The way they are handling the situation shows that they are doing everything in their power to ensure you still have a relationship with both of them. Which shows how much they care about you. Their divorce is not your fault and the way marriages fall apart can be very complicated. If cheating was involved, based on how your parents are handling it, I\u2019m gonna guess that it wasn\u2019t done in a way that made it a transgression worthy of lifetime banishment. At least in their eyes. I know that when everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, it can feel good to hit the self-destruct button. But if you do, you will regret it later. This is not an issue you should bring to Reddit, you should be talking to a therapist about it.", "Agreed. And to add to this too, if OP\u2019s parents have been acting strangely \u201cfor awhile,\u201d then this trip with the grandparents may have been strategically planned to get her out of the house so they could settle the logistics privately. Or, even if purely coincidental in timing, the opportunity could have been the same.", "This. OP,  please read this post.

It\u2019s about making an informed decision of who she wants to be with and without all the info she can\u2019t make an informed decision. Now if it truly is just they fell out of love due to problems left unsolved or unsaid in their marriage they can just say that and op would probably take that as an answer but saying just fell out of love that\u2019s not how life works it\u2019s a series of events. \n\nI mean personally if I was told my mom cheated and that\u2019s why my dad left I would be pissed  because I feel cheating shows your character especially if it\u2019s an affair because it shows your true colors and morals which is fucked up. And wanting to make sure someone who has questionable morals or they are untrustworthy isn\u2019t wrong when they are in charge of raising a human being. \n \nThis is my feelings but if given new info or new perspective I hadn\u2019t thought of I could change it but to me I Don\u2019t see why op wanting to be told the truth so they can know what to do or feel isn\u2019t a bad thing.

Whenever I\u2019ve yeeted someone so far I\u2019ve been happier afterward.", "I really hope you feel really great about yourself talking down to a kid such a big person", "With this kids attitude I can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s the case", "Then I\u2019d really like to know for reference so they should tell me.  They tell people how easy of a kid I am to deal with since I\u2019m usually pretty chill and studious so I\u2019d like to know if that was a lie.", "I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for longer than OP has been alive. The first thing they will tell her is that she can only control her own actions and how she responds to others. Any therapist worth their salt will help her manage her own feelings regardless of what her parents do or don\u2019t tell her.", "The \"bad\" thing they did may have been marrying each other in the first place. I would not want to saddle a 14 year old with the idea that her parents think their entire relationship was a mistake.", "And what if the reason is something completely inappropriate to tell a 14 year old?", "Exactly...if OP is mature enough to articulate that...they are mature enough to handle the answer.", "Not really if I lived with my grandma I\u2019d still go to the same school and everything. They just don\u2019t want me to live away from either of them but now I will be no matter what so idc what they want.", "But you're not acting like it right now, and now is when it counts. The way I see it, you've got two options:\n\n1. Get the support you need from therapy, engage and use it as the outlet you clearly need. Be empathetic to your parents and show them that you a) aren't going to make things worse for either of them and b) are mature enough to recognise that this is really hard for them too. Show respect for their right to privacy; something you also have a right to. \n\n2. Continue acting up, ranting and arguing with strangers on reddit. \n\nYour call. Personally I think option 1 is more productive and likely to result in you getting the information you want.", "One does not preclude the other. It sounds to me like they gave that answer and withheld any more specific details that culminate in the answer given.", "What if the reason confirms she's that type burden? What if she finds out that her parents never should have married each other in the first place and now realize that? What if the bad thing that caused the divorce was marrying and trying to stay together for 15 years? OP is assuming this was a good marriage and then something happened but what if it didn't? What if it was never a good marriage and her parents have never been happy with each other? I don't think a 14 year old kid should have to deal with that kind of existential crisis.", "Well you can't force a relationship just because your kid throws a fit. 14 is definitely old enough to understand shit happens. Lol yes they brought her into this world and are continuing to do their best. They can't force her to be happy she's making a choice to be an AH and her maturity alone proves she doesn't need to know. Would she rather grow up in a home with hate and arguing? They owe her a great life they don't have to make themselves miserable for it though.", "It is easy since she's acting like it! But I'm done arguing with teenagers, toodles!", "I have already said this to you but I'll say it again\u2014therapy is about learning to manage YOUR OWN emotions because that's literally all you can control. Family therapy is of course different, and I'm sure the therapist will determine whether they think it's beneficial for OP to know more.", "They told her they didn't love each other anymore.  She got her effing reason, she just didn't like it.", "I agree with you, they should definitely help OP work through her feelings. I don't think telling her the details of their divorce needs to be a part of that. She need to learn that people\u2014even her parents\u2014have boundaries. Her feelings about that isn't an indictment on her parents' choice to not tell her.", "No some of us have our own life experiences and arent being assholes to people who disagree with you. \n\nJust because our life experiences arent the same as yours doesnt make us entitled teenagers or idiots. It just makes you annoying and arrogant.", "I actually do agree with it to a certain extent.  In my house, that kid would make that threat one too many times, and then she'd be told to pack her bags.  Her dream was coming true.  She doesn't get to bully her parents because she is upset and hurting.", "LMAO  OP absolutely isn't going blame herself.  She's too busy desperately trying to blame one or both of her parents!!!!", "Yeah, cause you're 14. You have no concept of long term consequences yet.", "It won't be you, I'm sure of that. Don't blame yourself for their relationship not working out, whatever you do.", "Reread the quote from the post. OP said they dont need graphic details just what they stated", "If someone cheated, OP isn't asking for details on how many times with how many partners partners and what positions. It sounds like a simple \"Mom/Dad met someone else and fell in love with them instead\" would suffice.", "Then its best you go there since you wont be very productive at either parents homes. You might do better at grandmas", "I mean if I was 14 I\u2019d assume this with or without my parents telling me.\n\nYes I was that kid who assumed the absolute worst like OP.\n\nBut it\u2019s because of something else like genuinely falling out of love then I would\u2019ve beaten myself over nothing \n\nWhy not sit OP down and just explain to them like an ACTUAL explanation\n\nI.e. \n\u201cWe have different religions, we don\u2019t agree on the same political party, we don\u2019t enjoy having sex anymore, marriage life wasn\u2019t what we expected, we are no longer attracted to each other, our schedules don\u2019t align and we don\u2019t hang out anymore, We both found someone else we liked more\u201d \n\nIt might be difficult and would make probably make OP feel so much better and decrease those sleepless 4am nights with depression and intrusive thoughts nights", "LOL bye bye", "[deleted]", "OP has said she doesn\u2019t need the details. She just wants a why and I think it\u2019s fair. Yes, the parents are entitled to privacy, but I think it\u2019s hard to call the reason for divorce which heavily impacts her life going forward a personal matter as if it only affects them.", ">It just makes you annoying and arrogant.\n\nI think there's a rule on here about being civil.\n\nJust sayin'.....", "Well, maybe the parents, with inside information and being more well informed on the family dynamic and maturity level of the child and what they are able to handle, are making the right decision here and protecting all relationships. OP definitely doesn\u2019t come off as a \u201cwise and emotionally mature beyond their years\u201d 14 year old. She wants to find out who was at fault so she can cut them off.", "And if there isn\u2019t anything to tell?  She clearly says she wants someone to be \u201cthe bad guy\u201d but oftentimes there just isn\u2019t one.", "OP doesn\u2019t want reasons. OP wants ammo.", "Just report and move on since they resorted to name calling.", "I am in therapy, thanks though\u2014maybe you should try it since it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to therapy.", "If I'm understanding correctly, they did give her a reason\u2014they said they didn't love each other anymore. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not, but if OP really didn't need the details then what is she going on about?\n\nETA: When my parents were separated / divorced (most of my childhood and adolescence), I was either too young to understand or even ask why, or it was abundantly clear that they were miserable together and no reason beyond that was really necessary. Any details I got beyond that was from one parent or the other, which just made things even more confusing. It's hard for OP now, but she'll know what she needs to know in due time. Nothing they can say now will change the fact that they're getting divorced, and the fact that they're presenting a unified front is truly amazing.", "Yes and anytime someone disagrees with them they just say they are entitled teenagers. I can be nice but that goes for others on this thread", "Being able to articulate that they dont need sordid details but just the basic broad strokes comes off as incredibly mature.", "which is her right why should she have to be in a relationship with one parent who is either a cheater or an abuser?", "she really doesnt she just wants an answer more than its private.", "OP is 14 going through a major life event that's changing everything they've ever known. I think it's perfectly normal to want reasons in a situation like that.", "And OP said that didn\u2019t make sense. A lot of the comments here point to her not understanding adult relationships as if that\u2019s a shortcoming on her part (she\u2019s 14), but why don\u2019t they explain what that means so she understands and feels more secure in this big life change. She doesn\u2019t need the nitty gritty details but she wants something more to fill in the gap of why her life is changing. What does falling out of love mean? How does one fall out of love. They can explain it\u2019s not one single event like cheating or not some scandal, but they need to give her more.", "Cheating doesn\u2019t make you a bad parent, and if theres abuse then it\u2019s a completely different situation.", "But it IS private.  If THEY are okay with each other, then she should be okay with them.  It isn\u2019t her right to be the judge of who \u201ccaused this\u201d.", "Sure it\u2019s normal to want reasons. But with the state she\u2019s in currently, any reason may just be additional fuel on the fire and the parents are probably making the correct move at this time. I highly doubt any reason will make even the slightest dent in the extreme anger happening right now."]}
