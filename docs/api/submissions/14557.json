I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?\n\nEdit, Ok I\u2019m TA.  That\u2019s ok. I did some digging on my own tonight and I know pretty much what happened now. I don\u2019t feel bad about being an AH to AHs.

Their romantic relationship with each other is over, and it is time to accept that. They are completely allowed to keep their reasons private, especially because it is clear you don't know very much about mature relationships and are not old enough to understand.

They agree on what is best for you and even plan to get therapy for all of you. That\u2019s worth a lot more than finding out details asap. \n\nIt means both of your parents have only stopped loving *each other* but not you. There are so many children of divorce out there who can\u2019t say the same. Knowing the full story straight away in no way, shape or form makes up for losing not just the life you\u2019re used to but even one of your parents *by their own choice*. \n\nYou will find out down the line anyway but right now, the only one behaving AHish is you.

But congrats on ruining your relationship with your parents.", "My daughter was 15 when my marriage ended.\n\nThe details of what her father did would have traumatized her for life.

YOU need to listen to your school counselors advice on this.", "Soft YTA because while you\u2019re still a kid, and this is hard for you, I think you\u2019re acting a bit entitled and kinda mean for actively trying to hurt your parents.

Maybe this is a learning opportunity to gain some empathy for your parents and to understand that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you (sorry if that\u2019s harsh).\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is hard for you; my parents were separated and/or divorced for most of my childhood, and it was honestly much better for them to be apart than together and miserable.", "Soft YTA your counselor is right you shouldn't be playing them against each other. You can hold firm about wanting more details, but your parents are also allowed a right to keep things private. I think you also need to give them time to process all the emotions of them going through a divorce. I think they are trying to give you as much information as they can handle you knowing.", "YTA Maybe there is a reason, maybe they really did just fall out of love. You are making the whole situation more difficult than it needs to be. You should ask them to get you a therapist so you can deal with this better.", "Soft YTA, just because you haven't been told does not mean anyone's at fault.

You have the right to question EVERYTHING. But they might not have all the words for it.   \n***You have the right to feel grief, sadness, anger, even hate, but you need to wait a bit for the hate.***   \n\n\nThey haven't divorced because of malice or to hurt you, they have divorced because they cant function with themselves.", "YTA.  Your parents are being responsible adults by not pulling you into their drama.  Trust me, knowing the full details will do you no favors, as it will only give you someone to blame and alienate you from one or both parents.  Divorces happen, accept it and move on.", "Tbh I was in a similar situation. I was 15 when my parents started acting weird. I thought my dad was getting black mailed lol. Then Saturday night my dad left in a huff. I went up and asked my mom and she straight up told me my dad had an affair. After that she used me as her own personal therapist and it demolished the view I had of my dad, we\u2019re okay now, just took years of therapy. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to know, even if you really want to know. But I acted the same way you acted, threatening to parents to get your way. You\u2019re experiencing your own trauma in regards to this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH tho. Just remember ignorance can be bliss.", "YTA my friend.\n\nYour parents are both being very mature, and keeping their adult problems out of their kids life like they should. People get divorced for a lot of reasons, it\u2019s usually not some big thing. And even if something big did happened, they don\u2019t have to tell you. They are also entitled to privacy, even from you.\n\nWhat they DO owe you is clarity about what this means for you and your family. they owe it it to you to be respectful coparents with eachother and both be there for you. But they do not owe you whatever private thing they don\u2019t want to share.", "Dear OP, \n\nI don\u2019t want to call anyone TA here, because this is just overall a very shitty situation.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you, and that they sprung it on you like this.\n\nPersonally I think they might have thought it would be better for you this way, to come home to your mom already moved out, so you wouldn\u2019t have to witness the process. I\u2019m not saying what they did is right, but I think they were trying.\n\nI absolutely get that you want answers, but when a relationship ends there isn\u2019t always one clear reason why it ended, sometimes the truth is just \u201cWe tried everything, but we couldn\u2019t make it work.\u201d And as sad as it is, people do fall out of love. Relationships are hard work, and sometimes we forget to put in the work, and they fall apart. Or sometimes we do everything we can, and they still fall apart. \n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you want someone to blame, but adult relationships aren\u2019t always black and white, it\u2019s not always \u201cwe were super happy and everything was perfect and then one of us cheated and now everything is shit\u201d. One of them may have cheated, but even then it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re the sole reason for the breakup. In a decade long relationship realistically both partners have made mistakes and hurt the other one. \n\nI honestly think they\u2019re doing their best in this complex and complicated situation to hurt you as little as possible. Try to give them some time to come to terms with it themselves, they also have to adjust to their new reality, and they are dealing with a lot of emotions too. Please understand that they\u2019re trying to protect you by not putting you into the middle of their relationship drama. They\u2019re trying to work it out amongst themselves first, instead of putting all their fresh emotions on you, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\nI really think going to therapy alone on top of going to family therapy would be good for you. You understandably have a lot of anger, and other emotions, and therapy can help you deal with that.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll be able to navigate this and deal with it, and I really wish you all the best", "YTA, anybody who says they are going to \u201cyeet their parents\u201d is still too emotionally immature to handle the private details of their parents divorce.", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it sucks to hear this, but I'll tell you this as someone who came from the same situation (parents divorced when I was a teenager, and while I saw it coming from a while away, I was told very last second, matter-of-fact that they had already divorced when I came home during a school break):\n\nPeople fall out of love. It can happen over time or it can be something that someone notices one day. Either way, they are trying their best to be there for you from the sound of it, but they are still humans who need time to process things. They might tell you the details in the future when they might be ready, or they might not. At the end of the day, you're not entitled to know 100% and you probably never will, but that doesn't mean you can go blaming them or making it primarily about you. Your parents are still people, and this is a significant life change for them as much as it is for you.", "Giving you a gentle YTA because you are 14 years old and have no idea what makes an adult relationship/marriage work. I\u2019m sorry that your parents are divorcing and I am sorry that this will affect your life. You have the right to be upset, but what you\u2019re doing is cruel and extremely immature. In time I\u2019m sure maybe your parents will tell you what went on to lead to this. But trust that by the way they are handling this they only want what is best for EVERYONE. People grow apart. People change. That is simply a fact of life. If you are this angry, might I suggest asking your parents to assist you with finding a therapist that you can process this with if you don\u2019t want to talk to your parents. The wound is super fresh right now for your parents. Give it time.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA. You are too young to understand this, but sometimes grownups have reasons for things that their kids don\u2019t need to know about. Sure, infidelity could be the issue. So could abuse, or a dead bedroom, or financial issues, or one of them is gay, or one of them is having a midlife crisis. Or they grew apart and don\u2019t love each other anymore and are making a really hard decision. Maybe they have been \u201cshady\u201d because they were trying to hide that they were going to therapy to try to work things out. Pitting them against each other when they are trying to be reasonable and co-parent is really awful and unfair to all of you. Work with the therapist, be active and participate. You very clearly have feelings you need to work through. I know this is hard, but it\u2019s hard for them too and you acting like this is making it harder for everyone.", "I won\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole because you\u2019re a literal child. So immature behavior and an inability to handle emotional matters with sensitivity is not exactly your fault. Compassion and decency probably ought to be something a 14 year old can have, though, and you do seem to lack both. I\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t a reverse custody battle here. I\u2019ve never been happier to be child free. What a nightmare.", "I feel like this is a very light YTA, because even though you may not want to hear it, \"We just don't love each other anymore\" is very well a full reason. People DO fall out of love, and if you'd seen it coming, then it's obvious there was tension between them already. They're going thru something on their own, the world doesn't revolve around you and your explanations, and you can't pin your living situation based on your own thoughts, you're blaming innocent people for your own thoughts.", "My parents divorced when I was about 1\u20133 years old. I only found out why they did once I turned 18. Your parents just divorced, and you need to give them time to settle in their new lives. There's nothing wrong with making it clear that eventually, years down the line, you'd like to know what happened. Forcing it now, however, by turning them against one another even more than they already are is a terrible move.\n\nYTA, be patient and focus on yourself and your own well-being during this time.", "Sorry OP. \n\nYTA and you sound like a brat. I understand that you are shocked and hurt by their announcement, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to force them to air their dirty laundry in front of you. They are adults and you\u2019re not. They are doing their best to be civil with one another in front of you and you\u2019re just stirring the pot. \n\nYour attitude towards your parents shows that your maturity level just isn\u2019t there, and you probably will react poorly to whatever the truth is. \n\n10 years from now you will probably (hopefully) realize that you overreacted. For now, continue getting therapy to deal with the divorce and try to respect your parents right to privacy.", "I'm sorry your having to deal with this, but the reality is that some times the answers to these questions are not simple or black and white.\n\nMaybe the cliche of they fell out of love is the answer, but it took them a while to realize it was time to call it quits.\n\nMaybe something specific did happen like you suspect but neither of them are fully innocent or they are too ashamed to discuss it.\n\nIn many cases the ultimate trigger may indeed be something that for your own good, for whatever reason, you truly shouldn't be told yet.", "Relationships are hard work especially for one that lasted 20 years. A relationship breaking down can be no one's fault they could of just stopped being in love with eachother which is a common reason as people change. This divorce is probably hurting both of them let them tell you when they are ready to buy not now when it just happened as they need time to process everything and work on moving forward. Keep talking to your school counselor and continue to get support but don't make it any more difficult than it is already for your parents.", "I'm going with YTA specifically because of exactly what your counselor said.  You're trying to play them off each other.  If it wasn't for that I'd go with N A H because I get why you want to know but I think your parents are doing the correct thing by not telling you.  What happened happened between *them*, and even though it affects you, it is better to have your relationships with them going forward based off of you and them rather than anything that happened between them.  And FYI people just do stop loving each other for no big reason, happens all the time.", "They agreed to keep the details quiet so that they could jointly parent the affected child (you) in the least disruptive way.\r  \n\r  \nYou feel things have already been disrupted and want the facts.

That's their business.  What you need to know is that they are divorcing and what's going to happen next.\n\nI get that you want somebody to blame, but just because you want that doesn't mean you're entitled to know.

Do you generally doubt their judgment, or just in this situation? \n\nI am wondering if there\u2019s a reason that you\u2019re so certain that there has to be a villain and a hero. From your post and comments, it seems that you are a fairly black and white thinker, which makes sense for a 14-year-old. Relationships are rarely so clear, though, which is why I\u2019m wondering if they have set a standard that makes it hard for you to trust them on this.\n\nAlso, I came back from a year living abroad for my junior year of high school to find that my parents had split and my mom had already moved across the country. I get why you want an explanation, but the reality as far as I can see is that you have one. People absolutely stop loving each other. That said, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re hurting. It truly sucks.", "Yeah, YTA. Relationships fall apart for all kinds of reasons. And yes, people literally do just fall out of love \u201cfor no reason.\u201d You will understand that one day too. They don\u2019t owe you an explanation. It\u2019s literally just between them. \n\nBe grateful that you never saw them scream at each other or physically harm one another. Be grateful your family never had to call the police to your home because they were being violent and scared for their safety and yours. Be grateful that your parents aren\u2019t using you as a pawn or trying to pit you against each other. \n\nBe fucking grateful that they\u2019re seemingly being civil about this and stop giving them more hardship than they\u2019re already having to deal with. Be grateful that they love you and stop being a brat. You could have it so much worse. I went through worse myself as a kid much younger than you. I would have given anything for my parents to just speak rationally instead of fight like fucking savages and try to manipulate me and each other. \n\nOne day you will learn more about what\u2019s happened. When wounds have healed and a new normal has been worked out. But right now, you don\u2019t need to know. Believe me when I say that it doesn\u2019t matter. The marriage is over and you need to accept that your life is going to change now, and I\u2019m sure your parents are full of regret about that as it is. Don\u2019t add to their pain by being an asshole about it.", "YTA.\n\nI know you think you are an adult and mature for age as every 14 yo does.  (I still wish I knew now as much as I did at that age)  I assure you, you are not.  There are adult conversations and there are children conversations.  \n\nThis being said even an adult child does not need to know the intimate parts of a parents relationship with any adult.  \n\nIn addition, just so you can start to see what you really don't know.  People can grow apart, they can just no longer feel it and don't want to put the effort forward that is required to maintain a relationship.  Most marriages do not end because one partner has cheated or changed teams.  I mean some do but not the majority.  Adult relationships are complex.  Oh boy do I wish they were as simple as when I was 14....  movie style love..\n\nIt sucks I get it.  But the only information you are entitled to is information as it relates to you.  Examples, your parents still love you, where you are going to staying, how frequently you will see which parent and when.", "Let\u2019s just put AHery aside for this one. Neither. \n\nYou are VERY understandably grieving, unnerved, and angry about this major disruption to your family. Your home life is changing forever. You have no power to stop it. Your big feelings about this are so valid. Divorce for children is mega traumatic. \n\nPlease understand that your parents are doing the very best thing for you by not disclosing their reasons. You are 14, you should not be burdened unnecessarily by adult problems. They are giving you a gift by keeping you out of their problems. It sucks, but you do not need to know reasons. You do not need to understand why. \n\nPlease respect their excellent parenting and boundaries in this regard by not pushing them. \n\nI was 14 when my parents divorced and I wanted to know too. They wouldn\u2019t tell me, as is correct. Through the years though, with adulthood and more experience, things clarified for me. I was able to see for myself why their marriage failed, and even gain appreciation for the divorce.", "I can't make a judgment, because you're SO young. I hope it all works out.", "NAH. They don't want their relationship troubles to affect your relationship with either of them. Sometimes people do fall out of love.

I went on a trip with my grandparents and came back to my mom moved out and a serious sit down talk about them divorcing.  It\u2019s not exactly a surprise because they\u2019ve both been acting weird and shady for awhile but like that\u2019s not what I was expecting to come back to and they could have let me unpack first at least.  They asked me if I had any questions and I asked them which one cheated because that was my first thought. They got super uncomfortable and said that the reasons between them were private. I said not when it means I suddenly lost my family over it and they owe me at least some reason that this is happening and \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.  You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? They said that was all I needed to know and we need to talk about how the living situation was going to work and everything. I told them that I don\u2019t want to live with either of them if they\u2019re going to be like that.\n\nEveryone has been mad since then and my mom came over to talk it out last night. They still don\u2019t want to tell me why.  I told them both that if they were going to hide stuff, I\u2019ll just make up my own worst case and go with that. Since mom left, it can all be her fault. Since it\u2019s her fault, I won\u2019t live with her or go see her.  She got upset and said that was unfair and it wasn\u2019t her fault. I told her to give me the real reason then or just deal with it.  My dad said I was out of line and I said that it can all be his fault then and same deal. That started an argument between the two of them, but I\u2019m holding my own. Pretty sure at least one of them will crack and tell me what happened soon so I can decide how I feel about it. I don\u2019t need like graphic details but a simple \u201csomeone cheated\u201d or \u201cmom is a secret lesbian, don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ve both really changed a lot and don\u2019t want the same things\u201d would help. If one of them did something bad I want to know. If they won\u2019t own up or explain why there are no bad guys, they can both be the bad guy.\n\nI had to talk to my school counselor today and she said that it\u2019s totally understandable but playing them against each other is going to hurt everyone so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My instinct, as a parent, is to protect my child and that sometimes leads me to make decisions based on that premise, rather than a premise of being open with my child. My child is their own person with very valid emotions and opinions and I am forging a relationship with them that is ever changing as they grow. When they ask me questions I (1) dont want to answer, and (2)  think the answer to will hurt, I explain that.\n\nMaybe your parents are acting out of that instinct to protect, I dont know.

This is a very difficult time for both you and your parents. You are still a child and when you are young it is really really difficult to understand that the world does not exist in black and white.

Families and marriages are complex, and you will understand that the dynamics between adults can be not so clear cut. The bottom line is your parents love you and care for you. They are having a really difficult time now too. You need to take some deep breaths and find a trusted adult to speak with, such as a school psychologist, counselor, or social worker and express your feelings. The value of having parents who care for you is immense and you will deeply regret fighting them at every turn as you get older. I promise you.", "I\u2019m torn between NTA and ESH. First off, I\u2019m sorry that this is the way your parents decided to tell you about their divorce. I can\u2019t imagine how blind sighted I\u2019d be coming from a vacation to an entirely different home life. That\u2019s rough and it makes sense that you\u2019d angrily lash out and assume someone is at fault. Sometimes no one is \u201cat fault,\u201d but I also get that you still want more information from your parents. I think you and parents need to sit down and have another conversation where it isn\u2019t all so raw (I think it was a terrible idea to confront you having just gotten in from a trip and it\u2019s a big reason why I can\u2019t say YTA). Tell them how you\u2019re feeling and be honest. From your comments I can tell you\u2019re angry and your anger is valid, but it\u2019s not fair to take that anger and make it everyone else\u2019s problem by throwing out hurtful accusations. Good luck.", "Your feelings are very valid. I think a lot of people who would have a knee-jerk reaction to act the way you\u2019re acting. But it doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. It really sucks having to sit with discomfort and the unknown. And the amount of discomfort and unknown factors is a lot for someone your age. You are not an asshole and neither are your parents. The way they are handling the situation shows that they are doing everything in their power to ensure you still have a relationship with both of them. Which shows how much they care about you. Their divorce is not your fault and the way marriages fall apart can be very complicated. If cheating was involved, based on how your parents are handling it, I\u2019m gonna guess that it wasn\u2019t done in a way that made it a transgression worthy of lifetime banishment. At least in their eyes. I know that when everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart, it can feel good to hit the self-destruct button. But if you do, you will regret it later. This is not an issue you should bring to Reddit, you should be talking to a therapist about it.", "Agreed. And to add to this too, if OP\u2019s parents have been acting strangely \u201cfor awhile,\u201d then this trip with the grandparents may have been strategically planned to get her out of the house so they could settle the logistics privately.

Some things are important to know and maybe one of them does want to say but they are being threatened by the other parent. We don\u2019t know the power dynamics of the relationship or the ages. \nSo making a judgment on the kid and saying op is immature. \n\nHow is it immature to want to know the truth from people who are supposed to take care of you and your mental health? How can you put trust in someone who won\u2019t give you the truth? Especially if there was something horrible like cheating and they are trying to cover it up so they don\u2019t lose their child but the thing is to a lot of people cheating is disgusting and not something they would want to be around. It\u2019s about making an informed decision of who she wants to be with and without all the info she can\u2019t make an informed decision. Now if it truly is just they fell out of love due to problems left unsolved or unsaid in their marriage they can just say that and op would probably take that as an answer but saying just fell out of love that\u2019s not how life works it\u2019s a series of events. \n\nI mean personally if I was told my mom cheated and that\u2019s why my dad left I would be pissed  because I feel cheating shows your character especially if it\u2019s an affair because it shows your true colors and morals which is fucked up. And wanting to make sure someone who has questionable morals or they are untrustworthy isn\u2019t wrong when they are in charge of raising a human being. \n \nThis is my feelings but if given new info or new perspective I hadn\u2019t thought of I could change it but to me I Don\u2019t see why op wanting to be told the truth so they can know what to do or feel isn\u2019t a bad thing. I Don\u2019t know if I agree with the way she\u2019s going about trying to get the info but she in my opinion deserves to be given the truth. \n\nEither way I hope things work out for op", "I don't feel like I am qualified to form an opinion on this post, but why wouldn't the parents or the counselor explain to the kid that they will understand in the future?

They maintained a friendship until very recently but they\u2019re still civil. They\u2019ve both been able to be present for their children\u2019s graduations, accomplishments, special occasions, my husband\u2019s wedding, etc etc, because of their friendship.

This is concerning you as well. You deserve at least some reason that they're divorcing, the fact that they sat you down and had a conversation is a good thing.

Your child's parents are dealing with your divorce and you won't elaborate even a little? \n\nYou deserve some kind of explanation. It's okay to want that.

As an adult, I understand the world is much more complex than that. As I child, the answer \"NO\" was a full sentence and \"because I said so\" was the only reason I was entitled to. That pissed me off. As an parent, I offer explanations as often as possible. But sometimes, I just can't explain. Fortunately, my teen can accept that. Marriage is not the simple black and white thing you're making it out to be. You're being a jerk, but only because you lack the life experience to understand. You're never entitled to an explanation on this. No one is. My parents showed up every day and worked hard to give me a good life. As an adult, I strive to be a much like my mom as humanly possible. I hope you can find a way to move past this anger. Sometimes stuff just sucks, and this is one of those times.

On any other post lying is almost always said to be unacceptable in any form by commenters but here it\u2019s appropriate??  I understand different situations are cause for different solutions but here not so.  Sometimes we need to put ourselves in the OP\u2019s shoes and I would almost bet that any commenter if faced with the same would want to know why there parents are breaking up and of one cheater bc it would and should impact how they feel, how they view each parent, who they live with, and who they interact with.\n\nP.S. To the commenters saying she doesn\u2019t understand the complexities  of marriage that is probably true, however this is the time for her parents to teach her emotional intelligence, understanding on a deeper level, and possibly that things aren\u2019t always black and white.", "At the same time, she might decide to live with the cheater, only to find they are moving their affair partner, 5 step kids, and an evil step grandma in. Or she might bring her friends over after school only to find her mom being spit roasted by a couple guys young enough to be Ops older brothers. Chances of either happening,  probably low,  but you can't say nothing is changing  either. I agree that pitting them against each other night not be the right play,  but I think at 14, she deserves some idea of the choice she's making", "I disagree, if a parent cheats I think the kid should know, there's gonna be a lot of people that say that cheaters can be good parents, I vehemently disagree with that, the moment you put your fun, lust or need for a romantic connection before your kid, that makes you a bad parent and an asshole, OP deserves to know if someone is ruining his family, who it is.", "Oh dear, you hit the nail on the head. \nHope OP will consider these words.", "Ngl when my parents divorced it wasnt rocket science to figure out it was because my dad cheated as he got married 3 months laterl, and them trying to sugar coat it and be like \"people fall out of love\" made the discovery even more gross.", "Right? Back in school, so many of my friends with divorced parents knew the reason for the divorce and nearly all of them **internalized** that reason (essentially, they blamed themselves/took on the blame). Even when the reason had zero to do with them, they'd still blame themselves.\n\nThese parents decided to spare their kid that emotional baggage - even if she's not directly the problem, so many kids internalize/blame themselvees for crap like that - and she's essentially bullying/manipulating them like it's a game to her. Because she's convinced she 'deserves to know.'", "It is unreasonable. The reasons couples divorce is usually very personal and there is a lot of hurt and grief for the couple (of course there is too for the child). She doesn\u2019t need to know the intimate details of her parents marriage. The way she\u2019s acting is making things way worse.", "I can\u2019t understand people calling a 14yr old a T A for wanting to know why her family is being torn apart. All these big excuses people have for breaking their families apart. Sad. OP is NTA.", "honestly i think the answer is probably both sadder and more boring than whatever you\u2019re imagining. people really do fall out of love. \n\nnow let me say, in general, the way we treat children and teens is just wild. can\u2019t choose where or even who you live with, a lot of relationships forced on you and sometimes then yanked away, forced to go to school, have to ask to go to the bathroom, etc etc. so it is quite a blow to have this massive change thrust upon you with no say at all. and it makes complete sense that you would want to have all the information you can in order to process it. but even though we can and should improve the way we treat our youth generally, this is hard situation that will always be an inherent risk of having children/being a child/just being a part of a human family. connections can break and since a family is connected in many ways, they affect people who aren\u2019t even involved. it\u2019s just going to suck, no matter what anyone does. as hard as it is, your parents are actually doing the best thing in this situation. so while your reaction is completely understandable, wildly trying to grasp at reasons to stitch together something you can understand, there\u2019s not going to be any information you can learn that will enable you to do that. even if there is a single thing you could learn to make up your mind, you still won\u2019t really understand. who can ever understand? \n\nso while i don\u2019t doubt you are capable of berating them into telling you more about their divorce, i really don\u2019t think you should. it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s an easy narrative you could latch onto for a while, but since they both seem to be caring people, it\u2019s definitely more complicated than that. i think most likely though, if they give you more information it will be, yeah, boring and sad. im sorry you have to go through this. it\u2019s not fair that this is happening to you. but more information really isn\u2019t going to help", "Sure, I'll play along. Say you stay with grandma. Yeah, she said you can stay with her ***for the time being***, ***until things settled down,*** but is that fair to her that you now expect it for the next 4+ years?\n\nYour parents may have a legal obligation to pay for your food and clothing *right now,* because you're a minor, but let's think this out. Who's paying for the extras that *aren't* required, like school trips? Birthday parties? Your cell phone bill? Driving lessons?\n\nWho's taking you to the doctor from now on? Who's driving you to your friends' houses and taking you to and from school?\n\nWhat about college? Your parents are dead to you, so you don't expect any money from them once your turn eighteen, right? Even with great grades, extracurriculars, etc, getting a full ride is not easy or guaranteed. Who's going to cosign your loans in that case? Not mom, right, since you're yeeting her? Not dad? Do you want grandma to foot the bill? Is that fair?\n\nYou're hurt and I get that, but they are not obligated to tell you more than what they've said so far. *You are not owed the intimate details of their relationship.*", "OP is grieving and is currently in the \"anger\" stage.  Give her a break.", "She is not. She still has 11 more years of brain development before it\u2019s done. Even if they told her the reason, she can\u2019t quite understand it. Them being kosher and tight lipped about exact reasons is what it should be. She can learn all the details when she\u2019s an adult.", "I'm with you. My parents also divorced, and I was younger than OP. I was told that my mom was unhappy and didn't love my dad anymore. \n\nMy dad, however, sat me down at 12 and told me that if mom went through with the divorce he never wanted to see me or my brother again. \n\nOne way was the right way to handle it. One way was the very wrong way to handle it and it gave me some pretty serious emotional scars. Made those scars even worse when my dad followed through and refused to see us for the next decade. \n\nThere's an age-appropriate way to tell OP what happened to make her family fall apart. Their refusing to discuss it, honestly, makes me feel like someone *did* cheat.", "My kids don't ever need to know why their dad and I divorced, he and I both fucked up in many ways. But we have done everything in our power to be good coparents and make sure they are happy, loved, and disrupted as little aa possible. Because ultimately, no matter what actions happened they were a result of us just not being healthy for eachother after 15 years and getting together at 18. We were different people by our 30s and those people were no longer compatible and it became toxic.  The actions are shitty, but they arenot anything the kids need to know because actions are usually the results of build ups over time and many many small things snowballing. It's not something easily understood by kids, teens, or even young adults. It takes life experiences to understand how it all intertwines.\n\nYour loss of trust in your parents for not knowing all the details is something you need to work through. You are not entitled to that information, but you are entitled to having parents do everything in their power to give you a good life.... even when that means they separate so they canbe happier and healthier to do so for you", "But what if it\u2019s something really personal- like they aren\u2019t sexually attracted to one another any more or something like that? Do you really want to know that? How much is appropriate to tell kids?", "So relieved to see both your comments! \n\nI was feeling guilty in thinking that OP certainly wasn't alleviating any troubles the marriage might have had. \nI mean, I know psychologists describe that as a child's strategy: if they fight me/ over me, they can't fight each other... but seeing it in action is something else.\n\nETA: I apologise, OP. As the posters responding to my comment point out, this is more a reflection of my own situation and mental state than a helpful or truthful remark about your question. \nYour parents' choices are their own, you're a very normal teenager who's in no way responsible for what they do or don't do.\nAgain my apologies", "Or could be summed up as, \"we just don't love each other anymore.\"\n\nCould be that it's a bunch of little things that OP wouldn't see as acceptable reasons but those little things add up to \"we no longer work as a couple, we can probably have a civil co-parenting relationship if we divorce *now* but this relationship is straining at the seams and if we keep trying to 'make things work' there ***will*** be massive drama.\"", "Or you had happy home privilege? I'm in my 30s now, wanted to literally murder my father before I hit double digits.", "Right? OP didn't get a choice in being born. OP didn't get a choice in who her parents are. OP didn't get a choice in the divorce.\n\nIf they don't want to talk, then OP is finally free to *choose* to assume the worst. Parents don't like that? Well maybe they should be honest.", "You are choosing to throw away anyone who even potentially did a bad thing. Your prerogative but if you keep this up you will be a very lonely person through your life. No matter who is technically at fault here you are choosing to ruin your relationship with both of your parents. Congrats kid.", "I agree with all your statements. See now that you have gone through some things you have an understanding of how complex relationships and people really are. Honestly this is a hot take but that is something that is lost on most until mid to late 20s simply because they haven't lived much life. Not saying they haven't had life  incidents just not experience if that makes sense. I agree that the parents are doing the right thing. To be honest I don't think at any point the parents owe an explanation about what went on in their relationship.", "Maybe she'll realize how childish she's acting and be better.", "I am so so sorry that happened to you.", "But the gory details are not required. We became different people and found out that we no longer want the same things in life and or no longer get along well is fine. OP did not even get that. Just got \"Welcome home. Mom lives somewhere else now and we are getting divorced\". I think asking for any small explanation is fair.", "We find that we are no longer compatible in fundamental important ways. Done. No weird innapropriate stuff.", "To quote Esther Perel, \"the victim of the affair is not necessarily the victim of the relationship.\"\n\nNot that that point of view is popular on reddit, where people want to believe things are black-and-white and many redditors are young enough with happy enough lives (and good for them!) that they have trouble imagining something worse than being cheated on.", "I have a lot of sympathy for OP, genuinely, it must be extraordinarily rough in this day and age to be a teenager. I give kudos to parents who can handle the horrible things teenagers say and do - I simply could not. \n\nIf my kid did this when I'm already enduring a marriage of two decades ending, I'd be devastated. It's normal for a kid to lash out, but the degree of nastiness in her comments is something that would hurt me for life as her parent, and I would not handle it well. The ugly sides of parenting are often brushed aside and not everyone is capable of being a good parent during situations like this.\n\nI really hope it's just a front for reddit and she isn't saying these things to her parents. She needs therapy, ASAP.", "in what way is it appropriate to comment this where a 14 year old is going to see it?\n\nwhy do adults in this subreddit act so weird and callous when the poster is a literal kid?", "Yes. They deserve to know.", "That is a dysfunctional relationship and not good for the kids.", "That may be the case - but these are not just \u201cpeople messing with you\u201d.

Yes, obviously, it affects you, but their relationship with each other is only between them. I absolutely understand why you want to know, and I feel for you and am very sorry this is happening (and that some people here are being so unkind to you), but your parents are trying to do what is best for you in the long run. Literally every informed, knowledgeable person would advise any divorcing parents that they should absolutely not ever tell their children that one parent bears the blame for the divorce, even if it's true, because doing so would be deeply damaging to their children. I know it feels condescending as hell, but people here are right when they say that your black-and-white thinking is a function of your age, and you will grow out of it if you give yourself a chance to do so \u2013 and it would be tragic if you permanently damaged your relationship with one or both of your parents because, at 14, you simply weren't equipped to understand the nuances of adult romantic relationships.\n\nLike I said, I understand why you feel this burning need to know why, but it really will be better for you to let it go. I hope that you will.", "Lmao grow the hell up", "Thats not what they said tho. They said it's private", "Exactly!

You have a right to be angry, but you do yourself no favors by going scorched earth on your family.\n\nThere's a few things I can agree with you on up front:  \n1. If they lied to you (\"everything is fine\"), then that is pretty shitty. Whispered conversations and weird/shady behavior aren't great either.\n\n2. If they really dropped this on you the minute you got back from spring break, that was shitty, too.\n\n3. Yes, their divorce absolutely affects you, and that gives you some rights. The right to be heard, the right to have your needs, wants, and feelings considered, to have input into your new living arrangements.\n\n3. It probably will be a good idea for you to live with your grandma for a while. Might be a safe and stable place for you to process your emotions and reactions to what's happening.\n\nBut I'll also offer you some perspectives different from what you are thinking and feeling right now. Please consider them:\n\n1. While your parents may not have handled this perfectly, they also did get several things right. They didn't make you the arbitrator of their disagreements; they didn't invest in vilifying one another to you. When it comes to be your parents, they are working together, not in opposition to each other.\n2. They may not yet have a clear perspective on what happened to their marriage. They certainly are not likely to have the same perspective. They need their own time to process and understand what happened. Plus, in your current anger, you are likely to use any information they give you to further firebomb the family dynamic. Your current fireball approach is probably making them MORE reluctant to share even the little bits they might have otherwise been willing to share.\n3. Until you have more information, you can assume they both are at fault if you want. But you can't threaten them and use your assumptions to - again, firebomb the family - so that you get to hear some answer.\n4. I have to admire the integrity of your parents. In the face of your threats, they have not yet thrown one another under the bus, NOR HAVE THEY CHOSEN TO LIE TO YOU ABOUT WHY. They could have easily done that to get you off their backs. But they didn't.\n5. Moreover, your demands to know why aren't going to get you what you want anyway. If they tell you X reason, you are not likely (at this time) to believe them. You will want proof. Even if you believe they owe you the 'why,' you don't have any leg to stand on to need proof. You are not THEIR JUDGE AND JURY.\n6. I do think you can ask (and should get) family counseling - not to put them back together again. But to help you process and learn to relate to them individually as your parents and to help them learn to relate to each other and you and the broken-up family you now our. Your family may be breaking up, but that doesn't mean you can't build a new cohesiveness that serves each of you better than what you have now.\n7. If you allow things to have the time they need, I imagine that you will eventually (and I don't mean in the far away future) get to have some understanding of what happened with your parents.\n8. To be honest, I think you need to process and let go of this anger. If you don't, I can see it sabotaging your other life relationships. Please don't do that to yourself.\n\nWishing all of you well.", "Nobody is even pointing out that the child came home from vacation to find a parent gone!!!

It turns out the leaver was an even bigger AH than I thought, because I will do anything to live with my kid and see them everyday. If your parents are guilting you or acting upset with you, it makes them even bigger AH\u2019s. I\u2019m sure they are hurt, but divorce is putting their happiness first. If they don\u2019t want family arguments from a kid who is at the most emotional age, maybe they should have not done whatever it was to cause a divorce. This is on them.", "You might be TA, doesn't mean you're not my personal hero for playing them like that. Amazing work. As a child of 3 divorces, I can say I wish I had your attitude about it. Tough kid.", "NTA!", "YTA. It's their relationship, not yours. You have a relationship with each of your parents - those are the relationships you're part of. They don't owe you explanations about their relationship. And conversely, they shouldn't involve you in the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nWhen your dating you won't want your mom and dad demanding information about why each relationship fails. If you want to volunteer it, that's fine, but they don't have a right to that info any more than you have a right to info about their relationship.\n\nAlso, this idea that you \"did some digging\" and \"know pretty much what happened now\" - that's unlikely. Relationships are complicated. Especially ones over a decade long. Focus on your relationships with each of your parents and butt out of theirs.", "YTA.\n\nYou are 14, what do you know about long term relationships?\n\nI feel sad that you have to go through this, but being  stubborn aint helping. Hating one parent will not help you cope in the long run.\n\nPeople absolutely DO fall out of love, could have been happening for years and it just now hit a point where they felt they couldn't play happy families.

What exactly do you hope to gain from this??  This decision is theirs to make, not yours.  Where do you expect to go if you refuse to live with either in this circumstance?\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 15, and even then I understood the breakdown in their relationship was their business - not mine.  I just hoped beyond all hope that I would still have two involved parents for me and my brother, even if they weren\u2019t happy together, which we got - none of this \u201cbad guy\u201d bullshit.  I would never have thought it was my place to pull what you are doing, and with such blatant \u201cmain character\u201d bullshit like this.\n\nDivorce is bloody tricky with or without kids involved, let alone what you are saying you are doing on top of it.\n\nno bloody wonder they sent you on a 2 week holiday with your grandparents- I can imagine that is the only way they could have full and Frank adult conversations about their relationship without you fully inserting yourself into it - yeesh....\n\nEDIT:  I\u2019m so sorry to be this harsh- but it\u2019s only after reading your further dismissive replies that I comment - you are talking of finding emails between one parent and a landlord, finding messages etc from another parent, a \u201cdoomsday\u201c folder of evidence for a therapist, your grandfather\u2019s wartime physiological books, its revolting really..... \ud83e\udd2e  \n\nYou are invading their privacy in ways I\u2019m sure your 14yo self would scream about, in an event they did it to you.\n\nIf, of course, this is anything other than a writing exercise/troll.... \ud83d\udc4d", ">You don\u2019t just stop loving someone for no reason that\u2019s dumb, so what? \n\nYeah you do, that actually happens a lot.\n\nYou're young, you're hurting, but it is not worth to lose your parents over this. Soft YTA.", "You're going through a very tough thing right now, and it sucks. As someone whose parents have told me too much about their relationship issues, I've learnt that their relationship with eachother is really none of my business. I get to know what they're comfortable sharing (sometimes too much) and nothing more. What's important to me is their relationships with me as individuals.\n\nIt's an important lesson to learn I think, the idea that your relationship as a family unit and their relationship as a couple has very different dynamics, rules and expectations. As children, we are NOT part of their relationship with eachother. It doesn't seem like there's any AHs here.", "So far the only bad guy here is you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> \u201cwe don\u2019t love each other anymore\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nSometimes that really is the answer. People change, priorities shift, feelings fade and relationships end. There is not always a dramatic reason, a secret family, or steamy affair. Sometimes, love just.... dies. \n\nBut your need to blame someone is really just an outlet for your pain, which is expected as you are losing your family as you know it. But that doesn't make it right. \n\nMaybe take a step back and stop trying to be in the middle of their divorce, even though it affects you. \n\nYTA here.", "Hey, kid? As someone who *did* get the details of their parents divorce: you don't want it.", "This is just an example of kids not realizing their parents are regular people. Divorce is hard. Becoming a parent doesn't magically make hard things in life easier. In some ways, it makes it harder because you have to deal with the craziness while also being someone your kid(s) can depend on. And with anyone else, they should get some grace and space while dealing with this.\n\nAnd, if you're not *in* the relation, then no you are not owed an explanation. OP really needs to sit down and examine why knowing this information is so important to them. Obviously, they just want someone to be mad at. But that's life. Sometimes you don't get someone to be mad at, you just have to cope and grieve. YTA.", "There may not be anything to explain..

OP gets to decide what their criteria for relationship is. \n\nIf one of her parents cheated, they brought a potentially dangerous stranger into the family life. They prioritized that over OP's welfare and safety. OP gets to decide if that, to her, is worth ending a relationship.", "> what if she was the problem\n\nThat'd be on her parents.", "This is an incredibly fucked thing to say where this kid is going to see it.

Oh and if you didn't make the same choice you must be secretly miserable. \n\nSeriously, a *lot* of people on this site act like you're the immature one for not taking what they project onto you. Ironically, people like that are the most immature of all.", "Exactly, there is a middle ground.", "I think OP did the right thing here. It's kind of e-s-h or NAH from outside.\n\nI can see from OP's point of view there's a whole lot of bullshit going on and she's not being given even the vaguest hint of an explanation for a major change in her life. Which, sure, her parents have the right to do that. And she has the right to do what she's doing: say you both suck and I don't want to deal with either of you.\n\nIf this was something like moving internationally, or even changing schools, I suspect people here would think OP had a right to at least know why the change was happening. But somehow when it's a divorce and both parents agree that OP doesn't deserve anything that's ok?\n\nLonger term if the parents do keep their secrets I think this will burn both of them. If there really is a parent who did a bad thing OP is going to be pissed off about it when she finds out. But she's also going to be rightly pissed off at the parent who kept the secret.", "I'm a bit confused by the answers above yours. Yes, a 14-year-old doesn't have to know every detail of the divorce but it's not okay to keep them totally in the dark. I had a friend whose parents divorced when they were of the same age and the divorce was very amicable (they celebrated holidays, and birthdays, and had family vacations with both parents after the divorce). They never understood why the parents got divorced and even years after it was bothering them because the parents seemingly got along fine, and no reason was ever given beside a generic \"it's not working anymore\". Everyone would say their parents handled the divorce perfectly but in reality, they didn't. \n\nThat being said, I don't condone OP's manipulative tactics either.", "It's usually never a simple answer, unless one of them is a down and out awful person. They are both being civil and courteous to each other and both being there for OP through their own pain and grief. We tend to forget that divorce hurts people who are getting divorced too.\n\nIt is rarely as simple as \"who cheated\" among two good people. Maybe they're not attracted to each other anymore and their sex life sucks. Maybe one of them doesn't help with chores as much as the other thinks they should and the other person has some other such complaint against the previous one. Maybe they can't agree on finances. Maybe one of them has just started exploring their sexuality and is not ready to talk about it to anyone, let alone an impulsive grieving teenager. Even when one of them cheats (which I don't condone) there can be extenuating circumstances, look up sexless marriages and how tough they are for people with kids. \n\nAll they owe OP right now is to provide her with a safe and comfortable home and as much space and love as she needs to process her emotions. They don't owe her their personal struggles. In fact, not putting her in that middle of their dispute is the grown up and mature thing to do and is in OP's best long term interests, mentally and emotionally.\n\nEdited the sentence order for more clarity", "Yup. I'm 37, and I think OP is NTA and a lot of these judgements are condescending as fuck.", "Hard disagree, not everything is appropriate for a damn child. Everyone gets boundaries.", "I had this issue too. This thread is wild because this is usually the advice I see. Apparently that goes out the window when its about banging someone else. The information people think they are entitled to about others relationships is mind boggling.", "I think too op is just trying to exert some sense of control after being blinded only two weeks ago of her family as they\u2019ve known it\u2019s disintegration. OP listen to the cure, you\u2019ll find peace with time and not every question has answers", "It is insane - but that\u2019s what tv(hallmark) hammered into everyone\u2019s head apparently.  Create a perfect little fake universe for your kids, never have honest conversations, always smile, never cuss, complain or act unhappy.  And then get a tidy little divorce one day, but keep shutting out honesty and feelings.  And if the kids protest call them crazy and throw some pills at them", "They are not lying-they are just not expounding at this point in time. Big difference. OP sounds like she wants the \"dirty\" details RIGHT NOW and thinks knowing is going to change something. It's not. Her parents are getting a divorce regardless. As OP gets older and the divorce situation gets less painful for the parents, they will probably share more.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand your last paragraph. Are you somehow blaming me for not being able to trust my parents because they purposefully left me in the dark about a major life change? That this is something I \u201cneed to work through\u201d on my own? \n\nYou also keep talking about these \u201cgory details\u201d\u2014that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking for, and I believe OP has said that\u2019s not what she\u2019s asking for either. You can simplify it and generalize it to be more palatable for a younger person to understand, but that doesn\u2019t mean not telling them at all. It\u2019s like trying to communicate to a child that Grandma has passed away, you don\u2019t have to tell them exactly what or how, but you should still tell them. Why do you think so many adopted children feel blindsided by parents who hid the fact that they were adopted from them?", "I have yet to ever hear a good reason why cheating should happen before a divorce. Sexless marriage -> open it up or divorce. Want to explore your sexuality -> divorce and sleep with however many people you want guild free. Family violence and fear of getting a divorce -> don't you think you will get killed if you get caught? \n\nPlease tell in what situation would there be extenuating circumstances that makes cheating not make you the bad guy? When you could always get a divorce before", "I just want to inform you that a graduating class of 400 is not moderately large. That was my graduation class, and we were bumpkins.\n\nIn a suburb of Chicago in the 1990s moderately large was 1200.", "And what if one of OP's boundaries is not being dependent on a cheater (and who she lives with means she is dependent upon them)? For example, I will not date someone who has ever cheated. I can't make rules for other people, but I can control my own behavior by opting not to date them.\n\nOP cannot enforce that boundary of opting not to live with a cheater if she's kept in the dark.", "I on the other hand am glad I know the private things my mom was going through so I understand how bad things were. I saw it for myself in screenshots and it changed my view on my dad. It makes me sick to my stomach the shit my dad was pulling and I feel like I would hate him even more if I had found out later.", "Oh I'm computing them. It's because most adults see children as their possessions that needs to comply with their wishes, whatever those wishes is. That they're not allowed boundaries of their own that conflict with their parents or have emotional needs that the parents don't wish to honor.", "Wow, I'd have hated that.  My area schools tended to have between 300-350 in most graduating classes, but we had like 8 high schools that were all less than a 20 minute walk from one another.  The buildings themselves were overcrowded, but until recently they didn't have the acreage available in the area for larger buildings so my school was the largest class possible and  that was considered dangerously overcrowded.  I guess I also wasn't considering that my state is one of the highest ranked for education and there's a focus on smaller class sizes, I just wasn't in the nicest schools.  My sister applied (ok my mom applied) and could have gone to one of the other schools that was 10 minutes from our house, but she was a \"social butterfly\" and the idea of 10 students per class and only 150 in their entire class was unacceptable to her back then.", "They said the suburb was moderately large, not the graduating class. *Might* be more than one school there.\n\nI would agree that a graduating class of 400 is average to small. I finished school a few decades ago though, so my thoughts on it are fairly dated.", "Yeah, OP probably does need therapy.  BECAUSE HER FAMILY IS BEING BROKEN and she\u2019s just trying to deal with it.  A little \u201cnastiness\u201d is to be expected, especially if her parents didn\u2019t have the decency to sit her down and give her the barest explanation of - again - HER FAMILY BEING BROKEN.", "No, \"we don't love each other anymore\" is woefully insufficient for 14yo. You can pull that when the kid is 4, at 14 they deserve the real answer. You don't nuke someone's life from orbit and then shrug off their need for an answer to why that was necessary.", "Your dad sucks fwiw", "\"No longer love each other the same\" isn't even information - no shit things aren't the same, they're getting divorced. It's a statement of the current status.\n\nExplaining \"We loved each other but became different people, growing away rather than together\" is explaining what happened, not just the current status.", "Where did I say that her parents should do otherwise? Teenagers are often cruel for the sake of cruelty. It's part of their empathy and impulsivity - in that they often lack both, especially when very upset. It makes them assholes. Not entirely their fault, but they gotta learn that they're being an asshole so they know better in the future. OP is being an asshole. She needs guidance and therapy, and she also needs to know what she's doing is not acceptable just because she's upset. We cannot control our emotions but we can control how we act on them. You do not get a total pass for being openly nasty just because you're young - in fact, good parents shut that shit down because it leads to nasty adults. \n\nLike of course it's because her parents are getting divorced and not necessarily the parents individually, but the situation. She wants an answer that gives her a target, they set a boundary to prevent that, she goes nuclear because it's the easiest thing to latch on to. She is trying to assert control because she feels like she has lost all control in her life and her world is falling apart. Divorce is traumatic and life-changing, OP is handling it in a way that is not healthy and needs help, but she likely will not listen until she's had time to process and calm down with a neutral party.\n\nKids hate their parents for setting curfews, making them go to bed on time, making them go to school, making them eat their veggies, and telling them to stay away from bad friends. It's not always a personal failing of the adult, and in fact, it's normal for teenager to \"hate\" their parents (on occasion) because they're teenagers and being a teenager sucks. \n\nAnd just because they're teenagers doesn't mean parents aren't affected by the shit they say and do. Which is, again, why some of us choose not to be parents. It's not that OP is an unredeemable asshole, it's that not everybody is built to put up with and fix behavior like that while also going through something traumatic themselves.", "I agree completely. \ud83d\ude06", "Why does their age matter?\n\nYou said they don't **ever** need to know."]}
