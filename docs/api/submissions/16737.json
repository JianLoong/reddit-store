I see no ill intent here.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, Aaron's parents may suck and it may help you to see him as a victim of circumstances.

You could always have a talk with him and apologize, if he is open to that at all ofcourse.", "NTA. God bless all of the teachers. I don\u2019t know how you all deal with all of the bs that gets thrown at you. Aaron sounds like a nightmare, especially the part about the unwanted touching of his classmates. None of the punishments or incentives you mention seem severe enough to me for that.", "NTA. He's a bully who suffers no consequences for his actions. Now he has been humbled in front of his peers and not in a way he can play off as his being hard or cool so perhaps in might have some effect in tempering his atrocious behaviour.", "NTA, unless you made a habit of saying things like that.

However - I hope you're taking other, more serious measures to tackle the bullying? You say you've reported it and that's good, but are Aaron and the other students facing repercussions for their behavior? It sounds like the bullying is continuing because the bullies aren't facing consequences for their behavior. Like, I doubt the bullying would continue if the next person to make a comment like that in class had it reported to their parents/guardians, was given detention, or even suspended.", "He needed to be humiliated.", "I\u2019m sort of torn on this.

Sounds like Aaron is rather impulsive so potentially you could try reflective activities which is when you hold them back after class and instead of you talking, you ask questions and get them to do the hard thinking and come up with solutions (they absolutely hate it, which can be a good deterrent). Eg: why do you think I have held you back? What is the consequences of what you did on you and your classmates, what could be helpful in avoiding this in the future. The last one they may need some help (a subtle visual cue to stop/ pause, a routine, planned breaks like going to get a drink). Then be genuine about what they do well and that there is something good about them, but that you're being firm because you know they are capable and are just ironing out a few wrinkles and it takes time. It's a hard line to maintain being firm, supportive and kind, especially with students like Aaron that tries your patience and walks over others rights, but there will be something. Teaching is hard and your human and we all make mistakes, have a conversation, model how apologies work and own it, you will get more respect. Often with my more difficult students I say if they don't like my decision or think it was unfair then they can absolutely question it, but it needs to be after class because during class our focus is on learning and I have other students in the room that need teacher help. If they really care they will come see me and we can discuss, but a lot of the time they don't cause something else has grabbed their attention, and stops the classroom theatre of debates (which you can't afford to lose). You are doing well and so impressed with how in touch you are with classroom dynamics, doing the background checks with other teachers and getting him assessed. You slipped up so take a private moment or two to repair the relationship and apologise (him having a mate there will also help).", "ESH\n\nAaron for being a bully\n\nYou for humiliating a kid... esp because he's one who you believe is probably SpEd.", "[deleted]", "YTA- you\u2019re the adult and they are children, I totally get that you\u2019re a human with emotions but as a teacher you have to be able to tuck those away while on the clock.

If Aaron is old enough to bully, abuse, and molest other students he's old enough to be told a simple truth in front of his peers. Frankly, he sounds like he deserves far worse at this point.\n\nDoes he have an awful home life? Probably. But at a certain point it is no longer helpful to defend the feelings of bullies.

He\u2019s been suspended before but it makes no difference. Verbal bullying isn\u2019t enough to get him expelled. Hell, even physical bullying isn\u2019t enough to get someone expelled due to the laws in my area. But to give you an idea of things Admins have tried with him, we asked the parents to come in for a reverse suspension and they never showed up. During the SpEd conference, his mom said that they\u2019ve tried everything at home, but are so exhausted now that they\u2019ve given up which I think is incredibly sad. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t sympathize with Aaron but in that moment I felt that if I couldn\u2019t change, Aaron, then at least I could do the most good by showing that I won\u2019t tolerate him bullying Sophie.", "If I could do it again, I would\u2019ve just left it at that.

I\u2019m sure his other teachers have tried as well, but he acts the same way in their classes. Even incentives that I consider highly rewarding don\u2019t seem to tempt him: frequent breaks, candy, and chips. The only thing that moderately seems to work is allowing him to sit next to his friend, another female student in the classroom. But when he does, he distracts her and can\u2019t stop touching her inappropriately. She says she doesn\u2019t mind and denies it but it\u2019s creepy and uncomfortable.
