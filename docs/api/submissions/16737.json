This student who I will call Aaron (14M) doesn\u2019t seem to care about consequences. He constantly gets out of his seat, steals, uses profanity, and cannot stop inappropriately touching his classmates, especially girls. Aaron will elbow his classmates. I talked to Aaron\u2019s previous teacher and they warned me that he puts his hand creepily on girl\u2019s thighs. He\u2019s received plenty of calls home, lunch and after school detention, therapy, incentives, etc. Nothing seems to work. About  a month ago, Aaron\u2019s parents have signed their approval to have him tested for special education.\n\nI have another student who I will call Sofie (14F) who is already diagnosed as SpEd. Sofie is a great student, but cannot handle high stress situations. She will scream in frustration, bury her head in her arms, and shut down. She\u2019s in my worst class period with some of the worst students including Aaron. I\u2019ve talked to admins about potentially moving her class, but she\u2019s locked due to being part of the school band. Students at school bully her for amusement. They purposely pick on her until she screams. This happens at all times of the day and I reported it to my admins at the start of the school year.\n\nAaron frequently bullies Sofie. He will purposely take the long way to his desk and frustrate her on the way. I keep a close eye on both of them and remind Aaron to take the shortest path to his desk. Last week when Sofie got excited over a school event she was planning on attending, Aaron yelled at her to \u201cShut up.\u201d I was so tired of Aaron\u2019s poor behavior that I snapped back: \u201cHey Aaron why don\u2019t YOU stay quiet? You\u2019re not their parent. You can\u2019t even parent yourself.\u201d\n\nThe whole class erupted into \u201cooo\u201ds and laughter. In the moment, I was heated over how he constantly picks on her and wanted to stand up for her in public. But soon after walking away, I felt bad that I had humiliated Aaron. In the end, he\u2019s just a kid - and a possibly SpEd kid at that. Sofie didn\u2019t ask me to defend her. And I know I shouldn\u2019t abuse the power difference between me and my students to humiliate a child.\n\nWell anyways, I\u2019m ready for my judgement.

These people saying \"You're the adult\" are making very arbitrary judgement and from my perspective, even if what you had said was worse, you're defending a child you care about and doing your best to limit your behaviour within what you think is reaasonable. I see no ill intent here.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, Aaron's parents may suck and it may help you to see him as a victim of circumstances. Your behaviours, including trying to relate to him, understand him, and periodically punish him like this, can change the way he turns out. I'd also say that most of the school sucks for not finding a better way to accomidate sofie, as an aside.", "NTA - \n\nI think the reason why teachers are having such a hard time with students these days is because they have no fear of anything bad happening to them when they act up.   Because of you now he does.  \n\nGood job teach.", "Sometimes you fight fire with fire, and he got burned.", " NTA. \n\nEven though you are supposed to be the bigger person, I think with a child like Aaron it is impossible to always keep your composure. After all, he is constantly looking to provoke. I think it is human to slip up, while also realizing you shouldn't. You could always have a talk with him and apologize, if he is open to that at all ofcourse.", "NTA. God bless all of the teachers. I don\u2019t know how you all deal with all of the bs that gets thrown at you. Aaron sounds like a nightmare, especially the part about the unwanted touching of his classmates. None of the punishments or incentives you mention seem severe enough to me for that.", "NTA. He's a bully who suffers no consequences for his actions. Now he has been humbled in front of his peers and not in a way he can play off as his being hard or cool so perhaps in might have some effect in tempering his atrocious behaviour.", "NTA, unless you made a habit of saying things like that. Sometimes  people, even teens, need blunt honesty. The fact you said it in public might make your comment even more effective.", "NTA. He\u2019s a nasty bully and a sex pest. Well done for sticking up for Sofie since no one else seems to be doing so :(", "NTA, it was a pretty mild comment and sometimes bullies need to learn \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I had worse when I was a kid and I lived, lol. However - I hope you're taking other, more serious measures to tackle the bullying? You say you've reported it and that's good, but are Aaron and the other students facing repercussions for their behavior? It sounds like the bullying is continuing because the bullies aren't facing consequences for their behavior. Like, I doubt the bullying would continue if the next person to make a comment like that in class had it reported to their parents/guardians, was given detention, or even suspended.", "He needed to be humiliated.", "I\u2019m sort of torn on this. You\u2019re human and you probably said that bluntly to the kid, however that was highly unprofessional.\n\n\u201cI was heated over how he constantly picks on her and wanted to stand up for her in public.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s received plenty of calls home, lunch and after school detention, therapy, incentives, etc. Nothing seems to work.\u201d\n\nI want you to read back your text, you admitted that no matter what the staff did, your student wouldn\u2019t change his behaviour. Your comment back then was highly unnecessary and unproductive. Heck, he probably still continues harassing that poor girl while you\u2019re teaching.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say YTA, but please be more sensitive and don\u2019t act like you\u2019re a middle schooler standing up for another classmate lol. You know your words didn\u2019t do a single thing to change him.", "YTA. Probs should have stopped at \"you're not their parent\" as it puts him in his place but doesn't tear him down personally. Sounds like Aaron is rather impulsive so potentially you could try reflective activities which is when you hold them back after class and instead of you talking, you ask questions and get them to do the hard thinking and come up with solutions (they absolutely hate it, which can be a good deterrent). Eg: why do you think I have held you back? What is the consequences of what you did on you and your classmates, what could be helpful in avoiding this in the future. The last one they may need some help (a subtle visual cue to stop/ pause, a routine, planned breaks like going to get a drink). Then be genuine about what they do well and that there is something good about them, but that you're being firm because you know they are capable and are just ironing out a few wrinkles and it takes time. It's a hard line to maintain being firm, supportive and kind, especially with students like Aaron that tries your patience and walks over others rights, but there will be something. Teaching is hard and your human and we all make mistakes, have a conversation, model how apologies work and own it, you will get more respect. Often with my more difficult students I say if they don't like my decision or think it was unfair then they can absolutely question it, but it needs to be after class because during class our focus is on learning and I have other students in the room that need teacher help. If they really care they will come see me and we can discuss, but a lot of the time they don't cause something else has grabbed their attention, and stops the classroom theatre of debates (which you can't afford to lose). You are doing well and so impressed with how in touch you are with classroom dynamics, doing the background checks with other teachers and getting him assessed. You slipped up so take a private moment or two to repair the relationship and apologise (him having a mate there will also help).", "ESH\n\nAaron for being a bully\n\nYou for humiliating a kid... esp because he's one who you believe is probably SpEd.", "[deleted]", "YTA- you\u2019re the adult and they are children, I totally get that you\u2019re a human with emotions but as a teacher you have to be able to tuck those away while on the clock. I know it\u2019s hard but this is your job. You said yourself Aaron likely has his own issues and needs special education. You absolutely could have told him off without attacking him. Your anger should be towards admin for not having a system in place to remove disruptive students and get them the help they need", "I'm really inclined to say N T A but to humiliate a student like that. ESH I remember when I was younger my teacher disliked immigrants and I just came from China to Canada at age 8. My teacher read my writing with all the parts that didn't make sense and all the misspelled words. My writing was also ugly so sometimes if I wrote \"t\" it would look like an \"f\" For example, I wrote \"tuck\" and the teacher showed everybody my writing.

If Aaron is old enough to bully, abuse, and molest other students he's old enough to be told a simple truth in front of his peers. Frankly, he sounds like he deserves far worse at this point.\n\nDoes he have an awful home life? Probably. But at a certain point it is no longer helpful to defend the feelings of bullies. You were standing up for the real victim; even if Aaron is acting out because of a bad home life and/or mental illness, it doesn't excuse anything, and he certainly isn't warranted a sugar-coated scolding when he's literally tormenting other students.", "NTA.

He\u2019s been suspended before but it makes no difference. Verbal bullying isn\u2019t enough to get him expelled. Hell, even physical bullying isn\u2019t enough to get someone expelled due to the laws in my area. But to give you an idea of things Admins have tried with him, we asked the parents to come in for a reverse suspension and they never showed up. During the SpEd conference, his mom said that they\u2019ve tried everything at home, but are so exhausted now that they\u2019ve given up which I think is incredibly sad. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t sympathize with Aaron but in that moment I felt that if I couldn\u2019t change, Aaron, then at least I could do the most good by showing that I won\u2019t tolerate him bullying Sophie.", "If I could do it again, I would\u2019ve just left it at that. I don\u2019t want to come off as the type of person who is negative about every suggestion that I receive but I have tried almost all of the suggestions you gave. I\u2019ve tried talking to him outside of class, or after school and using positive reinforcement. When I get them to self, reflect, they refused to engage in the conversation and just answer with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. He can\u2019t seem to keep himself focused in a conversation with me. I\u2019m sure his other teachers have tried as well, but he acts the same way in their classes. Even incentives that I consider highly rewarding don\u2019t seem to tempt him: frequent breaks, candy, and chips. The only thing that moderately seems to work is allowing him to sit next to his friend another female student in the classroom. But when he does, he distract her and can\u2019t stop touching her inappropriately. She says she doesn\u2019t mind and denies it but it\u2019s creepy and uncomfortable.
