On Wednesday, one of them said that they would potentially be getting sick soon and asked someone to cover their weekend shift. No one else responded. I originally said in private message I could do it but only if they could cover a weekend shift for me for next month because it's an important day for me and generally coworkers cover specific days and swap days with others to repay favors and missed days, etc. Potentially sick co-worker said that they couldn't because they are also working that weekend in a different area.\n\nFast forward today, they stated that they are indeed sick and asked me if I could cover their shift. (I don't want to be an asshole and say no, but I kind of don't want to work the shift especially cause the area there can be a little hectic sometimes) I haven't responded yet. WIBTA?\n\nEDIT: for context about the job it\u2019s more about overseeing multiple areas and having a staff phone to oversee other employees, and the staff phone is passed around to the person the day of their assigned shift. You can\u2019t call out to your \u201cboss\u201d first you would have to switch with someone then email the person who handled the schedule for the year to confirm the switch.", "created_utc": 1667572322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym0lip/wibta_if_i_say_i_cant_cover_a_sick_coworkers/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They couldn't meet that condition for covering for you when they need off.  That means you said no. \n\n>one of them said that they would potentially be getting sick soon\n\nI take that to read they aren't actually sick, but need the time off anyway.  If so, that makes you even less of an AH if you don't want to do them a favor.\n\nETA If you are legimitly sick, call in sick to your manager and let them do their job to get coverage. Stop playing games with your Co-workers.", "NAH\n\nYou stated your conditions privately and they were turned down. That means you have absolutely no obligation, since a deal was not made.\n\nThere are over 30 other people in the groupchat who could potentially cover the weekend shift. There is no need whatsoever for you to do it if you don't want to.", "NAH\n\nIf you said yes, you have to keep your word, but considering the condition you have given, which does not seem to me to be fulfilled, you have the right to refuse. I think that politically in your company it would be bad to refuse but if we always have to follow the opinion of others, we are not done yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
