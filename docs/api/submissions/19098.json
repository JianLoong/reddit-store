Prior to this, while we were planning the baby shower and sending out invites, I had initially intended to invite my entire family. However, my wife informed me that the baby shower was going to be female-only, which confused me. In my family, I have attended baby showers for all my female relatives, so it felt like this was a cultural difference. Unfortunately, this meant I had to embarrassingly uninvite people after already sending out invitations.  \n\n\nInitially, I didn't make a big deal out of it because it was my wife's special day. However, later on, she told me that the \"no men\" rule extended to me as well. I thought she was joking, but she was serious, explaining that it's customary in her family to have a ladies-only baby shower.  \nAt this point, I became upset. In a baby shower that I was paying for and planning, I was being excluded from my own wife's event in my own home. I found it absurd. The party lasted for about 10 hours, and I was expected to leave my own house for the entire duration.   \n\n\nWe argued back and forth about this issue. It just seemed ridiculous to me that as her husband, I was not allowed to attend my own wife's baby shower. Her sister overheard our argument and supported my wife's stance, saying that men are typically not invited to baby showers and that my presence would ruin the atmosphere and \"vibe.\"  \n\n\nThis disagreement occurred three weeks before the actual baby shower, and even on the day before the event, I tried reasoning with my wife again to let me stay, but she still refused.  \n\n\nShe also told some of her family members about our argument because I got an angry text from her mother telling me to just listen to what she says since the baby shower is for her not me and that she can decide whoever attends or doesn't.\n\nI still refused to leave since it's our home and I'm literally paying for the event. I managed to compromise by just chilling in the backyard.

You and your wife should have discussed your visions for the baby shower prior to anyone sending out invitations. I think it's fair to say it's your wife's special day because growing a baby is hard, it's fair to say it's both of you celebrating the baby, and it's fair that different cultures have different traditions. It's not reasonable to have a 10 hour baby shower, call what she wanted ridiculous (fwiw, in my culture, no dads to be at baby showers), hang on to resentment that you're paying for it, or bring everyone else in on your drama.", "YTA- you're a man, you have no god given rights for anything to do with her pregnancy. She's the one carrying the baby, she makes the rules. And it is perfectly normal for baby showers to be female only.", "YTA. Most baby showers are female only, however I have been to some family ones too. In saying that the baby shower is for the pregnant person, celebrating the work going into growing the baby, with the bonus gifts for the baby. The pregnant person here made it clear she wanted a female only space, you should have respected that.", "NTA.  \n\n\nIf your wife has a tradition of women-only baby showers, that doesn't make her TA for wanting to keep that tradition going. BUT, that's absolutely something she needed to explain to you *right at the star*t, **before** you invited people. She certainly has the right, for her own baby shower, to say who can and cannot attend, and if she wants to make it women-only - well, her party, her invite-list. But she needed to TELL you.  \n\n\nAnd also, if the party had been two hours long and you were being asked to find something else to do that afternoon or that morning, that also seems reasonable - go see a movie, go for a walk. Again, this is something that should have been explained to you at the start ESPECIALLY as she was asking you to organise a party which you would not be attending. But for ten hours??? No way. Asking you to stay out of your own home for TEN HOURS is unreasonable and makes her TA, especially for springing it on you after you'd organised the party.

When I was pregnant with my son, no one who was coordinating any of the three baby showers thrown for me even mentioned gender of the guests. A man coordinated one of them actually. So I don't think that it would be unreasonable of OP to assume a non-gendered event. \n\nI don't think your wife handled anything well by springing on you that it was all-female so close to the event. That should've been discussed from the beginning with planning. And kicking you out of your own house for 10 hours?! That seems wild to me. Don't appreciate the entitlement with 'I paid for it, so I deserve to go,' but I get feeling like you should be there, especially since baby showers in my cultural norms are meant to celebrate the couple adding a member of the family.", "This isn't a bridal shower, it's a baby shower, a baby you had part in making and will take part in raising.

I was so miserable and uncomfortable at my shower, I'm happy my partner wasn't there to witness it. I've only been to all female showers and the games played are typically in depth about labor and pregnancy. If that's what she's accustomed too then it sounds like some cultural miscommunication.

You had conflicting opinions, which happens in a marriage, but there are better ways to manage them than to have both parties sulk for weeks about a literal party. Usually it boils down to solving the problem as a team rather than figuring out who is \"right.\"\n\nIn my area, baby showers are always female only, and they're not hosted or organized by the people giving birth (usually it's the pregnant person's mom, MIL, or another female relative or friend). However, it's clear that that varies a lot by region and family background, so your expectations were probably reasonable. \n\nYou didn't have to fight for 3+ weeks about it. You could have organized a girls-only party with her side, and a separate mixed party with your side. You could have had a small gathering at the same time as the shower with male relatives and friends, asking everyone to bring some diapers. You could have made your own plans for the day of the shower, doing something that you enjoy but isn't your wife's cup of tea. Likewise, she could have permitted you to attend after seeing how important it is to you.
