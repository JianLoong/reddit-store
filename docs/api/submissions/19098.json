Prior to this, while we were planning the baby shower and sending out invites, I had initially intended to invite my entire family. However, my wife informed me that the baby shower was going to be female-only, which confused me. In my family, I have attended baby showers for all my female relatives, so it felt like this was a cultural difference. Unfortunately, this meant I had to embarrassingly uninvite people after already sending out invitations.  \n\n\nInitially, I didn't make a big deal out of it because it was my wife's special day. However, later on, she told me that the \"no men\" rule extended to me as well. I thought she was joking, but she was serious, explaining that it's customary in her family to have a ladies-only baby shower.  \nAt this point, I became upset. In a baby shower that I was paying for and planning, I was being excluded from my own wife's event in my own home. I found it absurd. The party lasted for about 10 hours, and I was expected to leave my own house for the entire duration.   \n\n\nWe argued back and forth about this issue. It just seemed ridiculous to me that as her husband, I was not allowed to attend my own wife's baby shower. Her sister overheard our argument and supported my wife's stance, saying that men are typically not invited to baby showers and that my presence would ruin the atmosphere and \"vibe.\"  \n\n\nThis disagreement occurred three weeks before the actual baby shower, and even on the day before the event, I tried reasoning with my wife again to let me stay, but she still refused.  \n\n\nShe also told some of her family members about our argument because I got an angry text from her mother telling me to just listen to what she says since the baby shower is for her not me and that she can decide whoever attends or doesn't.\n\nI still refused to leave since it's our home and I'm literally paying for the event. I managed to compromise by just chilling in the backyard.

You and your wife should have discussed your visions for the baby shower prior to anyone sending out invitations. I think it's fair to say it's your wife's special day because growing a baby is hard, it's fair to say it's both of you celebrating the baby, and it's fair that different cultures have different traditions. It's not reasonable to have a 10 hour baby shower, call what she wanted ridiculous (fwiw, in my culture, no dads to be at baby showers), hang on to resentment that you're paying for it, or bring everyone else in on your drama.", "YTA- you're a man, you have no god given rights for anything to do with her pregnancy. She's the one carrying the baby, she makes the rules. And it is perfectly normal for baby showers to be female only.", "YTA. Most baby showers are female only, however I have been to some family ones too. In saying that the baby shower is for the pregnant person, celebrating the work going into growing the baby, with the bonus gifts for the baby.

BUT, that's absolutely something she needed to explain to you *right at the star*t, **before** you invited people. She certainly has the right, for her own baby shower, to say who can and cannot attend, and if she wants to make it women-only - well, her party, her invite-list. But she needed to TELL you.  \n\n\nAnd also, if the party had been two hours long and you were being asked to find something else to do that afternoon or that morning, that also seems reasonable - go see a movie, go for a walk. Again, this is something that should have been explained to you at the start ESPECIALLY as she was asking you to organise a party which you would not be attending. But for ten hours??? No way. Asking you to stay out of your own home for TEN HOURS is unreasonable and makes her TA, especially for springing it on you after you'd organised the party.

That should've been discussed from the beginning with planning. And kicking you out of your own house for 10 hours?! That seems wild to me.

I was so miserable and uncomfortable at my shower, I'm happy my partner wasn't there to witness it. I've only been to all female showers and the games played are typically in depth about labor and pregnancy. If that's what she's accustomed too then it sounds like some cultural miscommunication.

You had conflicting opinions, which happens in a marriage, but there are better ways to manage them than to have both parties sulk for weeks about a literal party. Usually it boils down to solving the problem as a team rather than figuring out who is \"right.\"\n\nIn my area, baby showers are always female only, and they're not hosted or organized by the people giving birth (usually it's the pregnant person's mom, MIL, or another female relative or friend). However, it's clear that that varies a lot by region and family background, so your expectations were probably reasonable. \n\nYou didn't have to fight for 3+ weeks about it. You could have organized a girls-only party with her side, and a separate mixed party with your side. You could have had a small gathering at the same time as the shower with male relatives and friends, asking everyone to bring some diapers.

About morning sickness and hormones. \n\nSubjects many women are not comfortable talking about around men and the dad. \n\nBaby showers are a way for mums to share their experiences in private, if they\u2019re not comfortable about sharing it in front of men.\n\nI suppose dad is a bit of an after thought, but he\u2019s not the one in pain after giving labour so mum does get a bit more attention.

The one that has to go through the morning sickness and ailments that come with pregnancies.\n\nI get there are more and more gender neutral baby showers, and women have more access to information and internet to talk about these things. And could probably arrange to have chats with friends, but some of the women they see will only be a big family events like a baby shower, and be awkward to bring it up at other family events. \n\nGender neutral is great for dad to be a part of the celebration, but it takes away women\u2019s comfort to speak about private things, like how your wife\u2019s aunt probably had second degree tear when she gave birth.

People tend not to bring big gifts, personally I buy the baby a gift when it arrives and take something small like socks to the baby shower, maybe hand cream for the mum.\n\nMy background is Indian, where there wouldn't be any celebration of the baby until it's birth, partly superstition and partly like..... being pregnant and giving birth can be a risky business so traditionally people can be a little more cautious about things. They older women would have a chat with the new mum but it wouldn't be a \"party\".\n\nSo maybe I don't really get the point of having a big party - especially when gender reveals seem to be getting to be such a big thing as well.

I always thought it was odd that society tell men that child rearing is not a women only job but then start cutting them out of baby related events immediately lol \ud83d\ude2c \n\nlike if the couple agrees to keep it traditional and be women only, fine, but if OP wanted to be there, why can't he be there? Why is tradition more important than her partner's wishes? \n\nI went to baby showers growing up where the father was present. Maybe if we included men and young boys, we'd have more involved fathers and less men that considered child raising \"women's work\"", "Yeah, in that case the men can offer gifts and not offer advice about giving birth. Still no reason for them not to be involved.", "Your answer is right on. I attended female-only baby showers all my life. And when I was very young, I thought, I wonder why the father isn't here. But you know what? It was a nice time for the ladies to hang out and be supportive of the woman going through pregnancy. Those are a lot of physical, hormonal, and emotional changes -- so many changes. I've been to unisex baby showers, too. Nice, but nowhere the same feeling. I actually felt those were more about gift-giving. There really wasn't much sharing of wisdom and stories and emotions.", "Sorry, but what does any of this have to do with a baby shower?\n\nBaby showers are for gift-giving and celebrating the baby. Saying only women are allowed IS misandry. Having a separate women-only event to talk about birthing would be completely reasonable. I never once said mothers shouldn't be allowed women only spaces to discuss birthing. Just that a BABY shower should include both parents as its about the baby.", "Absolutely. Isn't the naming ceremony or christening the time for father and mother to celebrate with everyone? It's not like there's no other opportunity to celebrate the baby.", "Then just have a get-together and not a party?\n\nI agree with you, though. I also don't see the point of a huge party but I think if you have a party celebrating the baby, then 100% both parents should be allowed to be there. If you want a female-only space for advice then you can just have a get-together to discuss it. I don't think it's any reason to not allow the father to attend the celebration of his child.", "Exactly. You can't get men involved in parenting actively if you push them away from all the fun bits.", "Well part of it is that Auntie Dee might not feel comfortable about talking about the intimate details about her childbirth with a man listening in. It changes the dynamics. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think that\u2019s sexist too, but we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree.", "Agreed. They can even offer advice, just about the parenting side rather than the birthing side.", "As others have said, showers are usually about gift-giving *and* advice-giving, melded together. And it\u2019s often not parenting advice; it\u2019s body advice. Someone who has been through childbirth and recovery will usually give gifts that will be useful in that arena. \n\nFor example, I was gifted nipple shields, stool softener, and padsicles. I had a \u201cco-ed\u201d shower and it definitely made those gifts and the related advice pretty awkward. Most guys don\u2019t want to hear about how hard it is to poo with a torn perineum.", "This *is* culturally where women have that women-only event to talk about birth and motherhood, you can feel how you want about it, but to say that every woman should change this tradition so that *you* don't feel left out is feeling arbitrary and nit-picky. This is the space in which women have had that ritual for generations in some cultures, we are not going to plan a whole other party just to make you feel better. Calling women-only spaces misandrist is missing the context under which we have developed the need for them. I tell you what, when women can start breastfeeding in public everywhere without someone flipping out about it, we'll circle back to the issue. Seem fair?", "Wouldn't the celebration of the child be when it arrives though? Or on the first birthday? The child is inside the mother at this point, no one's met it.

That is seen as just a demand for gifts. It should be done by close friends who OFFER to host as their gift to the bride or the mom-to-be. Either way, yes, showers are usually women only.

The father of the child should not be excluded from an event relating to HIS child. Excluding men from these baby related events (and even worse, sending all the men to go to go have their own outing unrelated to the child) also just contributes to the idea that men aren\u2019t as responsible for the kid and sets a bad precedent about child rearing being a \u201cwoman\u2019s affair.\u201d Both parents are equally responsible for creating and raising a child, and these ridiculous gender roles and traditions need to be left behind. \n\nIt certainly isn\u2019t a \u201cladies only\u201d event when the baby is actually born.

I've been to many and only 2 also had men there (the men were not the BF or husbands. It was a father of my friend and the other one was an uncle that was like a father figure). Some of the women's mothers paid for the shower, sometimes the husband did, I paid for one and one was paid for by my friend's brother but he also did not attend. It's supposed to be a day for your wife and the baby. Playing silly games, talking baby, pregnancy stuff and some women aren't comfortable talking freely about hemorrhoids, swollen ankles and bladder issues around men. I can't believe you sat in your backyard rather than having a day with your friends or playing golf or doing anything else. It comes off stubborn and possessive. It doesn't matter that you paid for it. It was for her. The world doesn't revolve around you. So she spent her baby shower knowing that you would just be sitting outside the whole time like she couldn't even have this day with her friends and family. You had already put her through the stress of a weeks long argument over this. That's not ok. In case you don't know, stress is not good for pregnant women.", "ESH.

Let this be an early, emotionally expensive lesson that you both were raised in different homes, with different traditions and cultural expectations, and you need to check in early and often about your assumptions about holidays, birthdays, work/life balance, discipline, and money - because ALL of that is going to hit you like a ton of bricks over the next few years with a kid in the house. My husband and I were raised in homes that in some ways were incredibly similar, and in some ways were extremely different - I definitely had assumptions about (for example) how the easter bunny operated that were totally different than how my husband expected the easter bunny to work. We check in early and often about how to handle big ticket events (and small stuff!).", "I think there was a middle ground to be found, but the wife didn't want to find it. Imo OP is NTA, but then again, we are only getting his viewpoint and we don't know how he communicated his side of things.\n\nMy cousin recently had a baby shower, and her husband went out for dinner with her dad and some of her other friends' husbands. No-one expressly told them they had to go, but it was just culturally understood that this was a ladies' event. The guys came back later after the shower was mostly over and hung out with us for a bit. It was nice and chill.\n\nWanting a shower to be \"girl time\" is understandable, but the expectant father shouldn't be outright banned from proceedings, imo.

First birthdays are a thing too.", "How do you define recent?  Because I'm 45 and I've been helping host baby showers for 30 years and my mom was hosting for friends and family long before I started helping.

Baby showers are fun and more about celebrating together than a gift grab, imo.  Obviously it\u2019d be better for someone else to host, but honestly more because of the stress of organizing an event.", "Some people don't have friends or family with the capability of that or willingness to do so.

He probably wanted to be there too!", "I\u2019ve been to probably 30-40 showers myself, and have been to only two co-ed baby showers, both this year.

That might be a regional thing, though!", "Same in Italy, bridal showers don't exist at all, and baby showers are a new thing very few people do and they're considered kind of tacky. Here people buy baby gifts for expecting couples/couples who just had babies either way, but it's not a good look to ask for them, it's something that comes from the heart. I do appreciate the convenience of a registry though.", "I've been to one female only. Everyone thought it was pretty weird, but knew it was a tradition. Every one since has been full invite, just a party with a theme of \"yay, baby\". No weird games or diaper cake.", "I live on the west coast. Never seen a baby shower that wasn't women only.

Get some friends to go hang out, do whatever sport or hobby they like, and enjoy some of the last moments of freedom.", "Go on a little day vacation?

There are sooo many times where the men don\u2019t care to be included. It\u2019s ridiculous how this entire comment thread has been about him paying for it or that you shouldn\u2019t be throwing your own shower nonsense.

I know it shouldnt matter, but it just makes me so sad.

The sexism-issue against women is of a different magnitude if you're looking at our society as a whole. That's something society has to acknowledge.
