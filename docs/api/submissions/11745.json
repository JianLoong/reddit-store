My husband has an older son (15) with his ex and is also \"dad\" to her older son (20). We live in 3-bedroom house. When my stepson stays, he sleeps on the couch. Despite him not really living with us my husband is still active in his life and spends lots of time with him. \n\nMy stepson's mom has 3 younger kids with her ex-husband and recently got a new boyfriend. She lives in a 2-bedroom apartment with stepson getting a room, the younger 3 sharing and her using the living room as a bedroom. Her taste in men is awful and her newest boyfriend is no different and my stepson has awful things to say about him. Despite this, and despite the fact she's only been dating him for around 10 months (she's known him longer), she is moving in with him in a week. He is somewhat well off and lives in an empty 4-bedroom house as his kids are all adults. There's a clear benefit for the kids to have a bigger space and a yard but obviously a much bigger danger in moving your kids in with a man you haven't been dating for long. My husband has tried to urge her out of making this choice, but she seems set on it. She has some major mental health issues and doesn't receive any child support from her ex-husband, so I understand to an extent why she needs to rely on a new boyfriend so heavily.\n\nA month ago, my stepson got into an argument with his mom and stayed with us for a few nights before going to his great grandpa\u2019s, who he has stayed with since. He has said that he will never move into the boyfriend's house. \n\nLast week he asked his dad if he could move in with us and we told him we\u2019d discuss it. I don't like the idea for a few reasons. The main one is space as we don't have a lot of it. He would either have to share with one of his much younger brothers or we'd have to give him his own room and cram 4 kids in together. Another reason is that my stepson isn't exactly the easiest teenager and has already proved to be a bad influence on my younger kids and he has a bad temper. I told my husband this and although he was unhappy and tried to change my mind he did go back to his son and tell him that it couldn't happen right now. If there weren\u2019t other options for him my answer would be different. His grandpa has the spare room and has already said he can stay for as long as he wants. My husband and I are starting to look at other rental options w/ 4 bedrooms for us to possibly move to in the near future. \n\nWe had dinner with stepson a few nights ago and explained are reasoning and told him he was still welcome whenever he wants. He doesn't seem to upset and is comfortable at his grandpa's.

I could understand the argument that there's no space and he has other options if he was an adult and had been moved out for a couple years already, but he's a child. He should live with a parent.

You would not be TA for that. But if that did happen, you should be making sure you're moving to a home with space for your stepson as soon as possible. However, as things are now, you haven't given him the option to move in and share a room, you've just decided for him that he's better off with the extra space, which is why you're TA.

HE did none of this, but she should fight harder and take better care of this boy than HIS FATHER has. I don't see any responsibility mentioned belonging to his actual parent.

He has a room in his mother\u2019s home with a step father he hates (don\u2019t know the details of this, but doesn\u2019t sound fair to say he can just live there). Yes, he can live with his great-grandfather, but why should he have to if he isn\u2019t comfortable and happy there? Every child deserves to be welcome in their parents\u2019 homes.
