My husband has an older son (15) with his ex and is also \"dad\" to her older son (20). We live in 3-bedroom house. When my stepson stays, he sleeps on the couch. Despite him not really living with us my husband is still active in his life and spends lots of time with him. \n\nMy stepson's mom has 3 younger kids with her ex-husband and recently got a new boyfriend. She lives in a 2-bedroom apartment with stepson getting a room, the younger 3 sharing and her using the living room as a bedroom. Her taste in men is awful and her newest boyfriend is no different and my stepson has awful things to say about him. Despite this, and despite the fact she's only been dating him for around 10 months (she's known him longer), she is moving in with him in a week. He is somewhat well off and lives in an empty 4-bedroom house as his kids are all adults. There's a clear benefit for the kids to have a bigger space and a yard but obviously a much bigger danger in moving your kids in with a man you haven't been dating for long. My husband has tried to urge her out of making this choice, but she seems set on it. She has some major mental health issues and doesn't receive any child support from her ex-husband, so I understand to an extent why she needs to rely on a new boyfriend so heavily.\n\nA month ago, my stepson got into an argument with his mom and stayed with us for a few nights before going to his great grandpa\u2019s, who he has stayed with since. He has said that he will never move into the boyfriend's house. \n\nLast week he asked his dad if he could move in with us and we told him we\u2019d discuss it. I don't like the idea for a few reasons. The main one is space as we don't have a lot of it. He would either have to share with one of his much younger brothers or we'd have to give him his own room and cram 4 kids in together. Another reason is that my stepson isn't exactly the easiest teenager and has already proved to be a bad influence on my younger kids and he has a bad temper. I told my husband this and although he was unhappy and tried to change my mind he did go back to his son and tell him that it couldn't happen right now. If there weren\u2019t other options for him my answer would be different. His grandpa has the spare room and has already said he can stay for as long as he wants. My husband and I are starting to look at other rental options w/ 4 bedrooms for us to possibly move to in the near future. \n\nWe had dinner with stepson a few nights ago and explained are reasoning and told him he was still welcome whenever he wants. He doesn't seem to upset and is comfortable at his grandpa's. However, his older brother has apparently found out about the situation (he's in the military in another state) and has called my husband up to call him a POS and evidently blamed the whole situation on me.

He has said that he will never move into the boyfriend's house. \n\nLast week he asked his dad if he could move in with us and we told him we\u2019d discuss it. I don't like the idea for a few reasons. The main one is space as we don't have a lot of it. He would either have to share with one of his much younger brothers or we'd have to give him his own room and cram 4 kids in together.

I could understand the argument that there's no space and he has other options if he was an adult and had been moved out for a couple years already, but he's a child. He should live with a parent.

You would not be TA for that. But if that did happen, you should be making sure you're moving to a home with space for your stepson as soon as possible. However, as things are now, you haven't given him the option to move in and share a room, you've just decided for him that he's better off with the extra space, which is why you're TA.

He obviously keeps stuff inside (like his reaction to them telling him he couldn\u2019t move in). I\u2019m sure if he was totally happy with gramps he wouldn\u2019t have even asked, especially as a 15 year old.", "the husband is the father of the 15 y old. 1 kid. she doesnt have childsupport for the other kids though. thats not op problem", "I'm.so sorry. I feel you.", "OMG.. I hope now you have friends and a family that love you.", "Also, OP said that her kids are ages 1-7. Assuming that the ages are around 1, 3, 5, and 7, they can definitely just let the youngest two sleep with them, let the 5 and 7 year olds share a room and give the last room to the teenager. Imagine saying that there is no space for him and continuing to have kids lmao.", "The husband is deadbeat dad", "I was going to say NTA but you just changed my mind. Sounds like OP never really made him a member of the family. \n\nIf the mother is mentally ill then his father should have stepped in far sooner.\n\nAs things are currently, he is better at the Grandfather's but this is after years of basically being neglected.", "I imagine stealing with the ex would be quite the adventure. \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m sure he loves to brag about \u201craising\u201d said son and take credit for his military service\u2026", "Is he difficult to deal with or does OP just not want to deal with him so she labels him difficult?", "This, sure accidents happen, my second came much sooner than was planned (and was full term), but 7 accidents don\u2019t happen. After a certain point it\u2019s absolute carelessness.\n\nEveryone owes it to their existing kids to stop having more kids if your not able to look after them all.", "Couldn't put it better.\n\nMy thought was 'stop breeding'.", "Harebillies?", "Perhaps Catholics who don\u2019t believe in birth control?", "I mean he's not necessarily 80 or even close. If my mom had me at 20, and I had a kid at 20, she'd be 40 as a grandma. If my kid then went on to have a kid at 20, I'd be a grandma at 40, and my mom would be a great grandma at 60.  This isn't even talking about families with multi generational teen pregnancies! \n\nEither way, ESH slash OP YTA. this poor kid seems like literally every adult in his life except great grandpa is putting him dead last.", "They got divorced so can\u2019t be great Catholics."]}
