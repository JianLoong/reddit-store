Anyone who beats their child is a shitty parent,", ">What did you do or say to make the 13yo say that to you?\n\nOP said in another comment that he's rude to everyone, including his brother", "Why", "It may help to frame it to him as social currency. \u201cTheses are things I provide for you, but I don\u2019t want to do them if you\u2019re mean to me\u201d and it can help to treat it as a thing of other people will treat him that way when he grows up. They key is to set up a guideline of behavior for it and use logic instead of emotion.\n\nSo you could have it be set on some rules\n*If he cusses at you no wifi for the day\n*if he yells at you no wifi for a day\n*If he throws things at you no car or wifi for the day\n\nThis also sounds like a point where he\u2019s trying to clarify your role in his life. When he says stuff like \u201cyou\u2019re not my mom, you can\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d then you take a deep breath and go \u201cno, but I am an adult who cares about you\u201d and reinforce your presence. Try to focus more on the good and engage with him. Ask him what he plays, what he ranks, talk about interests. There are ways to be gentle but firm.\n\nOn good days, reward them. Maybe they earn tacos, maybe pizza. Celebrate the wins. Not every time, but sometimes helps. When things are good go \u201cI feel like we\u2019re having such a good day today, how about we get a snack?\u201d Don\u2019t do it every time, but once in a while treat them. Get to know them and who they care about.\n\nAnd if you still struggle, you can use the no bank. If they tell you no, tell them you\u2019re putting it in the bank. And later let them know you\u2019re cashing it in. This may apply to only your things, but it can still be effective when used with compassion. \n\nYou also need to communicate and figure out what your role is with these kids and get an answer", "I would suggest considering the way you see things if you consider your relationship long term. MY internet, and MY car, suggest you\u2019re not overly committed to joining your lives, and maybe the kids are picking up on that division.", "First of all, the kid is 13. He isn't so young he needs to be taught the difference between right and wrong. I feel like you're talking about a 4 year old, or maybe a dog. \n\nSecond, this is more about OP not putting up with disrespect than it is about the kid, because it's not her kid to discipline. There's really not much she can do other than stick up for herself.", "How would you address this?", "It\u2019s not a positive stimuli though is it? It\u2019s a pleasure stimuli and like any, it can be harmful and addictive.", "If his child was younger this would track. But his kid is 13. I don't think parents really occupy day to day time with their 13 year olds.", "Although I support what you are trying to achieve, it may be a good idea to allow him to use the wifi to complete homework in the kitchen or someone where he can be supervised. If you don't allow him to use the wifi for homework, that may affect him educationally and may even affect custody between your boyfriend and the mother.", "I don\u2019t know if OP if one to investigate this given she responded to this comment with cruelty. But agree.", "My thoughts exactly, how is this not talked about more", "Then why does the kid fear physical punishment. It's rooted in there and rebelling against that is quite normal", "Amazing, love your work. And again NTA but don't be the AH to yourself. You deserve respect and doesn't seem like either of them are giving it to you. Love from a stranger xo", "All teenagers are rude.  Par for th\u00e9 course.  OP isn\u2019t telling us what sparked the comment for a reason.", "So if your BF pays for the electric he can shut off your power?", "Because!", "This seems like good advice! Make punishments specific and predictable, and also include rewards - a mix of stick and carrot. What's a 'no bank' though?", "You don't think teenagers need to learn right from wrong? He's in a major stage of social development that heavily involves testing and breaking social boundaries. That is learning right and wrong by application.\n\nYou may be right, but I never made that point in the first place. I'm simply saying that punishment alone is really not a good strategy to teaching children to behave well.", "Its important to also reward for the correct / wanted behaviour - positive or negative reward. \n\nMost important part is verbal praise when he isn't rude and behaves \"correctly\". Other than that, small rewards like candy that he likes, time on his phone to use the apps he likes etc.\n\nIf we punish for doing what we don't want to happen, it's essential we also reward for the correct behaviour. Otherwise, the risk is that the person is only recieving punishment - this can make things way, way worse in the long term, as they effectively have no mental route to safety.", "Removal of WiFi is removal of a positive stimuli. He can't use YouTube etc. that's the whole point of the punishment - he's losing something he finds pleasurable.\n\nPositive doesn't mean some overall good outcome or not - it's basically about whether the person likes what's happening or not.", "The kid can go to the library. When homework takes that much more time and effort he'll learn to behave faster.", "The distance learning phase of COVID is over, kid's 13. If he needs the internet to do his homework, his teacher should be fired, then beaten severely, then tarred and feathered.", "The hitting comment? OP said her boyfriend used to spank the boys when they were little\n\n>All teenagers are rude.\n\nAnd being rude will get you punished lol", "Electric is a shared expense.  \nI pay half.", "I think he knows damn well the way he's behaving is inappropriate. It's not always knowing right from wrong so much as knowing what you can get away with. \n\nWithout speculating too much, it's a fair assumption the kid is acting out due the family dynamic. His dad is the only person in a position to navigate those waters. \n\nMy response was in reaction to the implied notion that OP can do much of anything other than stand up for herself. Let's say I'm wrong and the kid actually does need to learn right from wrong. OP isn't in a position to do anything about that. The entire topic is moot.", "And if there isn\u2019t ever behavior to reward?", "That is assuming he has access to a good local library as a lot of school libraries don't stay open super late. Also, that may likely result in him walking home late at night if he has a lot of homework. Plus this is assuming this kid highly cares about his education and doesn't give up easily. I could easily see this being used as an excuse not to complete homework or to rush homework which creates a whole new issue.", "what the fuck", "My eldest\u2019s home would was **all** online years before Covid. Do you live under a rock?", "You'd be surprised how much school work is on computers these days. I say this as someone who graduated in 2018 and its probably worse now in 2023.", "Punishment is not going overboard by hoarding wifi & a car.  OP shouldn\u2019t live with kids, period.  She\u2019s acting like one herself.  If a parent has the water bill in their name they don\u2019t say \u201cwell I pay it & I own it\u201d like some schoolyard bully.  It\u2019s a household utility.", "Than the problem is their father, it seems.\nShe probably should start talking to him, about their behavior and what disciplinary actions to take. \nIf there's a need to discipline a child she should get the validation of the parent with actual right to discipline them. \nThe situation now looks like she makes her BF choose between supporting his GF and supporting his child. Which is precisely what makes her look like she is fighting with kids instead of acting like an adult.", "Still not your kid, petty as hell, and I am sure there is SOME bill he pays exclusively that you would be pissed if he cut you off. But you do you. Nothing better than ruining the relationship by alienating a partners kids.", "Then either the child has one of some fairly rare conditions,l causing antisocial and aggressive behaviours, or far more likely is that a lack of reward and perceived value has already begun to affect their behaviour, and professional advice is definitely required.\n\nIt's also possible you're just not looking hard enough or spending enough time with the child - the average amount of time we spend with children is ever diminishing. I saw a study recently suggesting for school age children we spend on average half an hour a day parenting them, as an example.", "That escalated quickly", "Not everyone can afford internet or has access to a device all the time. A teacher punishing poor students is a horrible criminal.", "i graduated in 09 and even back then, a lot of shit required internet access.", "If taking away non-essentials until they learn to be kind to others (including their own brother) is overboard then what isn\u2019t?\n\nBy 13 years old most children are wearing makeup, posting videos and using social media (experience from when I was 13). IMO if they\u2019re capable of that they should know that being rude to people isn\u2019t nice. By the time I was 13 I wasn\u2019t being rude to people around me for no reason as I was taught by my parents and warned by my sister not to. If he\u2019s mean to his brother, dad and step-mom then I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be damaging to let him learn that it\u2019s a privilege to have things like wifi and someone who will drop off their friends everywhere- as well as having a family who has tolerated it for that long.\n\nEdit: Also adding that OP does not need to let them borrow her car if they\u2019re disrespectful to her considering their own father can still drop them off in his vehicle. If he can\u2019t take friends too due to lack of seating then he should ask OP nicely instead of being rude to her and then getting his father to take him places in her car.", "Treating kids like they\u2019re too stupid to learn any lessons is a quick way to create a spoiled brat.\n13 year olds are not \u201cdumb dumb kids\u201d.\n\nDiscipline needs to be taught no matter the age, and unfortunately if no one is there to step up for her (i.e lack of action from their father) then she has no choice but to step up for herself. She\u2019s taking away non essentials so that he can learn to be more respectful to people, which will benefit him in the long run anyway.", "Oh yeah for sure the bf is the problem.  Of course a 13 year old kid is going to give his parents/step parents some attitude but it's the dads job to correct the behavior. And OP isn't asking for her bf to choose who to support. She's asking him to not allow his son to disrespect her, which coincidentally would also be supporting his son. It is important to his future as an adult out in society for him to learn to treat people with respect and kindness...so yes, in this situation it falls on the dad to fix it but he won't. So in the meantime, yeah I wouldn't be paying for the kids internet and chauffer service.", "Who is we here? In this post it\u2019s their boyfriend\u2019s kid not their own so I would expect them to not spend a ton of time with not-even their stepson.", "Man. I needed Internet to do my homework in the beginning of 2000s. Freaking 20 years ago in a freaking non-first world country. What are you on about? Are you stuck in the 90s?", "lol ok", "I'm making some wider points to suggest where some fundamental problems may lie that can ultimately cause this kind of behaviour.\n\nIf you only deal with the symptom, which is the behaviour of the child, and not the underlying cause, then the behaviour won't stop, it will just change."]}
