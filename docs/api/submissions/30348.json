Your bf is more upset about the wifi and skating than his kid respecting you. His son is going to learn that if you treat people poorly, they aren't going to help you which is a valuable lesson.

Thanks for having the self-respect and guts to pull privileges from this nasty, unappreciative specimen of spoilt child. It\u2019s a wonderful, valuable ongoing lesson. Keep it up. When the kid begs, you can say that depending on his permanent background behavior modification, you may even start to experiment with very gradually and intermittently introducing some of your former kindnesses. You need to exert the control until he and his dad understand how to grow up, and how the real world works.", "NTA. Why are you in a relationship with a man who allows his son to disrespect you? Your bf can\u2019t insist that his son like you or see you as a mother figure but he can insist that his son be respectful towards you. The fact that he\u2019s not doing anything shows how little respect he has for you. It might be time to rethink this living arrangement.", "NTA\n\nIf the kid wants to act like an AH he can pay the AH tax.", "NTA. I am in the reverse position to you; my girlfriend's son (20) is exactly the same kind of sulky, childish, lazy, obnoxious little shit, and it absolutely galls me that she asks me back her up when she needs to yank his chain, but then won't back me up when he's in the wrong with me (eg taking my brand new $50k work truck without my permission to pick up his mates). I have now moved out into my own place, and I made sure she knew it was because she wouldn't put me or our relationship first no matter how much of a turd he behaved like.", "NTA at all. If it\u2019s what the son cares about then it\u2019s what will make him realize his wrong doings. I would honestly say that those 2 things are relatively small for disrespecting your elder(s). I\u2019m no parent and can\u2019t say what\u2019s exactly right because today\u2019s world is different than when I grew up and some things are majorly frowned upon.

The kid doesn't need punished, he needs therapy.\n\nAdmittedly, \"hey, you can't treat me mean and expect me to cooperate with you\" is treating him as an equal, not a child. Whether that's good or bad depends. Maybe tell the kid \"hey, I can treat you as a child and control your environment, or I can treat you as an adult and a peer.

Not allowing ur BF use ur vehicle when he wants to bring children skating is straight up petty.

He isn't your kid, its not your place. Your BF lives there too so its only 50% your Wi-Fi.

However her bf is not stepping up to do it and she has been put in an uncomfortable and difficult position. I don't think she has the right to discipline the kid in any way that takes away something of his, something the father pays for or a privilege that the father gives him. She does however absolutely have the right to not allow him to use something that is hers. That's not being petty, that's basically just not allowing someone to walk all over her by not paying for luxuries for someone who treats her like dirt. The kid is 13, not 3 and knows better than to be disrespectful. Also we don't really know how much she contributes to the kids lives. For all we know she is caring for them as if they're her own.", "But kids are not people, they are dumb dumb kids. You are treating them like equals and actually fighting with them.  Probably discuss their behavior and disciplinary acts with your BF?\n\nOn the other thought, if you think ur BF is spineless and his kids are nuisance, maybe, consider getting rid of them?"]}
