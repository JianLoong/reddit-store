She's already playing the role by removing WiFi access.", "It appears as parenting to you because you're approaching the situation as if they already have a parent/child relationship, *but they don't,* and picking this moment to try to establish one would be a horrible decision. It's not so much parenting as OP establishing dominance in her own house, which is something you should do if a person of any age disrespect you. Her approach would be different if the kid was older, but the fact that he's 13 doesn't make it \"parenting.\"\n\nThe area where we agree is taking away wifi won't fix anything. I realize I haven't acknowledged that until now. \n\nThe area where we disagree is that OP is in a position to do any fixing. She's plainly not.
