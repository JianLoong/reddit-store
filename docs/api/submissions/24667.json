You over there, hey champ, or just ignore him.", "I mean, fulfilling his vows shouldn't have been too much to ask. Both are shitty here, but only OP for doing it IN FRONT of sis.", "Exactly! I assumed the dislike is because of the divorce. As I understood, their sister was quite young and they  didn't say how long they were married. If he mistreated her I could understand more the grudge, but still, 4 years had passed and he might changed, unless he was violent, but OP didn't mentioned that. It would be good for OP to explained more about what exactly they dislikes of him. And yes, OP is making this all about themselves.", "You say fulfilling his vows shouldn't be too much to ask. OP sounds immature and ignorant. The fact they even say others admit they both contributed to the end of their marriage the first time says it wasn't all his fault, but OP is fully blaming him. It seems that other people are way more aware than them in the conditions. Not enough info to blame him completely on that end.\n\nThe husband sounds ways more mature, and is only asking for his name to be used.

Even if she's a pushover.", "OP already had a judgement against the guy. As immature as they sound, I can almost guarantee they don't know as much about the behind closed door situation as the rest of the family knows. OP sounds arrogant and closed minded. How does EVERYBODY ELSE tell you they both contributed to the end, but you are hard stuck on it's his fault?", "Sooo.. Are you planning on talking about the story soon or\u2026?", "Cause not one of yall are showing me where it says that. I see how HE left. I see how HE came back in. \nOP has no duty to be respectful to Ex. Just respectful to sister when she's there which means just NOT engaging if he has to be around Ex.", "Are you fucking on drugs bro? \n\nThe entire point of treating him like shit is because he betrayed OPs sister.", "Lmfao. You're taking a small post by OP where they clearly sound ignorant and immature and trying to validate themselves. Pieces of their post show how unreliable of a story teller and how one sided their story is. They didn't even say WHY he left just \"he got a big head\". Like seriously, buddy, read between the lines of this person's post. They are telling you what they want you to hear.\n\nHe isn't even being respectful of his sister at all. Did you not read the part that she wants him to be respectful of her and stop being a complete and utter douchbag to her spouse?\n\nEdit: you also said he should put his big girl panties on and earn his way back in? Like you have no idea about the time frame. This sounds like a course of months, not days. He probably has \"put his big girl panties on\" (what a stupid phrase, by the way) and proved it to HER, the only one who matters in this scenario. He should respect HER wishes if he cares so much about HER", "No no no no. You were literally just inserting yourself into this. Anyway, your take is still wrong. You never get to treat anyone like shit especially if they did something to someone who isn\u2019t you or your kid. Like OPs sister is an adult lol, she doesn\u2019t need OP doing crap like this to \u201cprotect\u201d her.", "Which is why, if you DID read my comments you'd see where I said he's not as asshole to the ex but an asshole to the sister. Have his fun, when she's not there to witness it.\n\nSo you just made up the \"fact\" that she did something to cause a divorce?", "I was telling you as a sibling, I totally get OP. You don't fuck with someone if you want to stay in good graces with their people. \n\n\nAnd yes I do. I fully get to treat someone like shit because they were shit first to someone I love. You can't have your cake and eat it too. And it's not even about being protective, it's about making a point that \"I don't fucking like you. And you aren't apart of this family no matter how much doormats coddle you\"", "If the Ex Husband didn't want to be called that, you now how easily he could have avoided that title by just... being her husband?", "He shouldn't do that even when she's not there. That is his wish, which would be nice.\n\nAnd no, I did not make up that fact, and never said that. Stop being deceitful. I said exactly what OP said in their post, which is that EVERYBODY SAID THEY BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO THE END OF THE MARRIAGE. I never once blamed her for causing the divorce. You are disgusting for insinuating that I did. Are you really this daft? Are you going to sit there and ignore OP said that? I didn't add any more information to this than OP put out there.", "OPs opinion on the ex husband doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that they\u2019re acting like a child with this dumb name calling. It\u2019s been 4 years since the divorce and the guy may or may not have changed. OP not even giving him a chance and pulling this crap is not only a huge AH move, but a childish one too. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to like or accept the ex husband, but since literally every else is she should put HER OWN feelings aside and just be civil. You can make it known that you actively don\u2019t like a person without constantly shitting on them and being annoying.\n\nOP has no business holding a grudge against the ex husband like this, regardless of what he did in the past. The sister has seemingly forgave him, so if there\u2019s nothing weird going on then there\u2019s no reason for OP not to as well.", "It\u2019s not necessarily about what\u2019s he\u2019s being called it\u2019s that he\u2019s being called something that he doesn\u2019t like and even after being told to stop by multiple people, OP is still doing it.\n\nIf someone you know is fat do you constantly call them \u201cfat person\u201d even after they tell you stop just because they could\u2019ve \u201ceasily avoided that title\u201d and not been fat if they just ate healthy and worked out?
