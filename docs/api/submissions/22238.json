You said she would want to prolong the trip but that isn't in the cards financially, is she not understanding this, does she ever deal with y'all's finances? If she doesn't deal with them at all I guess I could see how the financial burden of the trip could be lost on her.", "Depending on how far along she is it may not even be safe for her to be in a car for 16hrs.

She was labeled as selfish and you said that wasn't the right word and insinuated that because she is carrying a child she cannot be selfish when that's bs. Billions of women have carried children and some of them must have been selfish at some point in the pregnancy.", "Being cautious is important too. Being reckless is not a characteristic to be proud of. That's why I find this husband very commendable for asking and informing himself. \n\nSomeone else would just tell her to suck it up and leave. Telling her: \"Single parents can do it, so you can too\" \"it's only three days, if you can't handle that, then we have bigger problems\" and when something happens to the baby it would be her fault too for not taking care of herself.", "That information was given after my initial comment.", "I insinuated that in this particular case, which is the only one I know of. She does not strike me as selfish rather stressed and unable to communicate her need for help from the husband.", "But there's such a thing as too cautious.  Nor do I see how him going could be considering reckless. \n\nAnd in this case, where there's no reason to believe or think that something bad would happen, trying to stop OP from going due to her paranoia is being too cautious, and honestly pretty controlling of her.\n\nThat said, I do think if she can't handle three days on her own, that is indicative of a bigger problem. People can't predict the future. There are absolutely going to be times when she needs to watch after the kids on her own for a few days, just as there are absolutely going to be times when he heeds to watch the kids on his own for a few days. Being unable to do that is indicative of a problem.\n\nBesides, this is all hypothetical anyway, as we have no reason to believe she doesn't want OP to go because she's being overly cautious, or because she thinks she's unable to handle 3 days on her own.  If either of these were the case, she would be saying \"No, I don't want you to go because I'll have trouble handling everything on my own.\" Not \"No, I don't want you to go, because I haven't ever gone there and I want to go there as well.\" \n\nIt sounds to me more that she just doesn't want to be left out, and doesn't care how much of an issue her and the kid going along would cause. That absolutely makes her an asshole, imo.", "With what taking care of a five year old for 3 days in the first trimester. She just got back from a family vacation recently. If she has stress it is misplaced and being deployed in a selfish manner.", "If she's unable to communicate her need for help from OP, then that makes her even more of an asshole.\n\nBut again, entirely besides the point, as there's no indication she thinks she would even need help. Not once has it been stated anywhere that she doesn't want OP to go because of the workload that would fall on her, but rather because she wants to go as well, with their 5 year old, and she doesn't care how much more of an issue that would cause.\n\nIt's like you're actively digging to find some reason to absolve her, a reason that we have no reason to believe has even crossed her mind.", "We will have to agree to disagree.  I believe that taking care of kids and first trimester pregnancy are not on the same level and just like the husband can find a babysitter or family members to help the wife. He can find someone else to help the brother. So he is the AH. Imo", "Hummmm.  Maybe I did mirror myself indeed. I know my communication skills while pregnant did suck indeed and I am certain I needed a lot of attention while pregnant from my husband. \n\nI still believe making her out to be the villian is wrong. The brother has more options than she has. She can't undo her hormones for three days to accommodate others and the brother CAN contact movers to help. \n\nThe hate this pregnant lady is getting is just sick and I would definitely be upset if I was that pregnant lady.", "She can't control her hormones, but that doesn't mean it's okay to let them control her.\n\nAnd I don't think anybody is making her out to be some mustache twirling machiavellian villain or anything.

Your pregnant wife and 5 yr old will not be of assistance, if anything they would be a hindrance.\n\n2) if the usual reasons wives have fits over hubby leaving were valid here, she would be asking you to postpone or not go--wanting to go too and turn it into a longer/blown out vacation means she is not likely to be having a high risk pregnancy at this time nor about to give birth where she would not want to be far from her doctor/hospital.  So I'm going to assume she's in earlier stage of pregnancy with reasonably good health.\n\n3) she wants to turn this into an unbudgeted longer vacation when you just had one.

But she says you can\u2019t go help your brother without her, you have other problems you need to address.", "You are so delusional \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "As a mother myself- this 'trip' sounds like a fn nightmare being pregnant with a 5yr. F that. \n\nIt's a  super long ass drive, you'll only be there for a day - in which you have to pack up and load your brothers shit into a truck. It's not a trip or vacation- it's work. \n\nI'd rather stay home and chill with my kid. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell her no and hold to that. What you're planning isn't a vacation thing, it's a moving stuff thing for your brother who is now out of the military and just going to get his stuff back.", "NTA tell her no. This isn't a vacation, you and your brother are going to move his stuff. She'll be fine for a day or two. Let her be angry, she's being selfish and controlling.", "She is perfectly capable of being alone and entertaining herself.", "NTA it\u2019s not a vacation your helping your brother move. Her and the kids really should stay home. If your brother thought he could do it himself he wouldn\u2019t have asked for help. He will probably need you to take turns driving.", "NTA this is a huge \ud83d\udea9 but you\u2019re married so, \u201csorry, buddy. You chose her\u201d.  I\u2019d simply leave and let her stew in her moods.", "YTA. Leaving your pregnant wife home alone with a 5-year-old? Completely irresponsible.", "Did you actually name it to her as a 'guy's trip'? Because 'guy's trip' sounds a lot more fun than what you've described the true purpose of the trip to be. Not excusing her unreasonable stance but possibly an explanation of why she's pissed that you don't see a need for her to go.", "NTA.", "5 year olds aren't really toddlers anymore. There are 5 year olds in kindergarten. They walk and run fine. They are mostly over their weird emotional tantrums. They can write their name and speak in full sentences.", "Or any other person that has to travel for work or whatever reason. Jesus fn christ!!", "She wants to go and nothing will prevent her from going.", "Oh so why don\u2019t you fecking sue me for misreading the bloody kid\u2019s age?", "> everybody knows the first weeks are very hard for the woman.\n\nYou should tell that to all the 3rd trimester women lol, you might not make it out alive.", "Word! I worked a call center job during the first half of my second pregnancy, but had to take sick leave for the second because morning sickness and cs calls don't mix.\n\nHaving to be home with my toddler while my partner was at work was only marginally easier. Although it did get easier once my tot understood mommy was okay and stopped scream-crying every time I got sick. He ended up starting to get me water shortly before his bro was born. He's an absolute treasure", "That's like saying a 36 month old baby is a newborn.", "The baseline is 12-36 months. Even with definitions varying, 5 is far too old to refer to a child as a toddler.", "Well, do you think I could make any money off of it? Saving up for home improvements has been such a drag.", "No need to get so incredibly aggressive over a correction.", "Right!?! Like wtf?? I see so many of these posts where grown ass people can't be left alone for a few days - with good reason. \n\nAre 'adults' so incapable of being by themselves that they need a babysitter!?!?\n\nWhy are people not independent anymore? Why can't people take care of themselves without someone there to hold their hand?\n\nDrives me fn nuts!!!\n\nThank you for reading my rant lol", "Lmao I think she\u2019s more worried about where he\u2019s going. Military town like San Diego are party places and have a certain reputation when going out and drinking.", "Because she's controlling. Can't stop him from going so she has to make it miserable enough for him that he never does it again.", "First trimester, not close to birth. And she's a grown woman, not a toddler whose hand he needs to hold. She is perfectly capable of looking after her own kid for three days. In fact, I'd be incredibly concerned if she couldn't.", "That was left out of the original text.\n\nYour wife does't seem to understand this is nor relaxing and chilling with you bro.  You hard  doing hard driving (16 hrs when you drive, on day to unload to the storage place.)\n\nI can't comprehend why the wife doesn't get this. \n\nNTA", "5 year olds go to school.", "Movers cost *significantly* more than the gas for a 16 hour road trip split 2 ways.", "It\u2019s not just gas for a 2 hour (edit: day) drive. It\u2019s also 2 nights in a hotel and all of your food from a restaurant for two days, plus whatever convenience items his wife will require on account of his absence.", "It's mostly just women who are treated like that. Most people perpetrating it think that they are standing up for said women too. Hell, a fair amount of them *are* women.\n\nThe thing that I've really noticed about this sub, is that lots of commenters tend to infantilize and invalidate women in order to make a man look bad. It's pretty much misogyny intended to be misandry.", "Still significantly less than the cost of movers for a 16 hour drive.\n\nMovers wanted nearly $1,500 move us about 10 miles, a 30 minute drive. You think an interstate move is going to be cheaper than a cheap hotel room and some diner food split between 2 people?", "It truly is. \n\nLook - I have dealt with anxiety and depression most of my adult life. But I have never expected other people to bend and conform to my issues. They are mine to deal with!!!", "That was probably for a whole-ass house. This is a small storage unit worth of items. I\u2019m just saying OP has other options.", "Def NTA. Sounds like you are finding the positive side of doing this huge favor for your brother by enjoying the time w him. And even if it remotely made sense for your wife to join - if she can\u2019t handle being alone with a five-year-old for the weekend in a house (w tons of support!) why does she think she could handle this trip? Sounds pretty co-dependenty on her part.", "NTA especially since she has taken vacations without you either. This is not even a vacation it\u2019s helping out your brother. She sounds controlling honestly.", "5 year old is a kindergartner, not a toddler.", "i wish i could sue you for acting like a toddler on here at your age lol!", "NTA. I don't even get why she'd want to go on a trip like that? I wouldn't.", "NTA but her clinginess may be a response to not feeling super secure in her relationship with you. Do you make her feel loved?do you carry your weight at home and help with parenting? It\u2019s weird she would wanna go as it sound be awful for her so he is wanting to either be with you or watch you"]}
