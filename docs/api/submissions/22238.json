You said she would want to prolong the trip but that isn't in the cards financially, is she not understanding this, does she ever deal with y'all's finances? If she doesn't deal with them at all I guess I could see how the financial burden of the trip could be lost on her.", "Depending on how far along she is it may not even be safe for her to be in a car for 16hrs. The only way to do it would be to stop regularly so she can get out and walk and get the blood flowing again. She\u2019s at a higher risk of blood clots since she\u2019s pregnant.", "Except you did. She was labeled as selfish and you said that wasn't the right word and insinuated that because she is carrying a child she cannot be selfish when that's bs. Billions of women have carried children and some of them must have been selfish at some point in the pregnancy.", "Being cautious is important too. Being reckless is not a characteristic to be proud of. That's why I find this husband very commendable for asking and informing himself. \n\nSomeone else would just tell her to suck it up and leave. Telling her: \"Single parents can do it, so you can too\" \"it's only three days, if you can't handle that, then we have bigger problems\" and when something happens to the baby it would be her fault too for not taking care of herself.", "That information was given after my initial comment.", "I insinuated that in this particular case, which is the only one I know of. She does not strike me as selfish rather stressed and unable to communicate her need for help from the husband.", "But there's such a thing as too cautious.  Nor do I see how him going could be considering reckless. \n\nAnd in this case, where there's no reason to believe or think that something bad would happen, trying to stop OP from going due to her paranoia is being too cautious, and honestly pretty controlling of her.\n\nThat said, I do think if she can't handle three days on her own, that is indicative of a bigger problem. People can't predict the future. There are absolutely going to be times when she needs to watch after the kids on her own for a few days, just as there are absolutely going to be times when he heeds to watch the kids on his own for a few days. Being unable to do that is indicative of a problem.\n\nBesides, this is all hypothetical anyway, as we have no reason to believe she doesn't want OP to go because she's being overly cautious, or because she thinks she's unable to handle 3 days on her own.  If either of these were the case, she would be saying \"No, I don't want you to go because I'll have trouble handling everything on my own.\" Not \"No, I don't want you to go, because I haven't ever gone there and I want to go there as well.\" \n\nIt sounds to me more that she just doesn't want to be left out, and doesn't care how much of an issue her and the kid going along would cause. That absolutely makes her an asshole, imo.", "With what taking care of a five year old for 3 days in the first trimester. She just got back from a family vacation recently. If she has stress it is misplaced and being deployed in a selfish manner.", "If she's unable to communicate her need for help from OP, then that makes her even more of an asshole.\n\nBut again, entirely besides the point, as there's no indication she thinks she would even need help. Not once has it been stated anywhere that she doesn't want OP to go because of the workload that would fall on her, but rather because she wants to go as well, with their 5 year old, and she doesn't care how much more of an issue that would cause.\n\nIt's like you're actively digging to find some reason to absolve her, a reason that we have no reason to believe has even crossed her mind.", "We will have to agree to disagree.  I believe that taking care of kids and first trimester pregnancy are not on the same level and just like the husband can find a babysitter or family members to help the wife. He can find someone else to help the brother. So he is the AH. Imo", "Hummmm.  Maybe I did mirror myself indeed. I know my communication skills while pregnant did suck indeed and I am certain I needed a lot of attention while pregnant from my husband. \n\nI still believe making her out to be the villian is wrong. The brother has more options than she has. She can't undo her hormones for three days to accommodate others and the brother CAN contact movers to help. \n\nThe hate this pregnant lady is getting is just sick and I would definitely be upset if I was that pregnant lady.", "She can't control her hormones, but that doesn't mean it's okay to let them control her.\n\nAnd I don't think anybody is making her out to be some mustache twirling machiavellian villain or anything. We're just judging who in this situation is wrong, which in this sub we do so by saying she's the asshole.", "Which she is not. Anyway, we will have to agree to disagree.", "She would be massively uncomfortable. The kid would be cranky af. The drive would take two days with all the pit stops. Yeah, this is a no-brainer.

Your pregnant wife and 5 yr old will not be of assistance, if anything they would be a hindrance.\n\n2) if the usual reasons wives have fits over hubby leaving were valid here, she would be asking you to postpone or not go--wanting to go too and turn it into a longer/blown out vacation means she is not likely to be having a high risk pregnancy at this time nor about to give birth where she would not want to be far from her doctor/hospital.  So I'm going to assume she's in earlier stage of pregnancy with reasonably good health.\n\n3) she wants to turn this into an unbudgeted longer vacation when you just had one.  And she has gone on vacations solo.", "NTA it\u2019s a work trip not a holiday.", "This isn't even a vacation and having a young child around a loading area is always an accident waiting to happen.

That's ridiculous.", "She\u2019s had a few vacations over about a week long with our child and no children. But I will admit it\u2019s not very often. We both work and aren\u2019t exactly wealthy so vacations come few and far between for either of us. \n\nI genuinely never considered it being an overworked parent issue, this is something I will bring up and try to work with her on. Maybe she can take a small trip on that weekend and leave our kid with family or maybe I\u2019ll give her another weekend she can go do whatever and I\u2019ll watch our child. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention I could definitely see this being a factor as she really is a magnificent mother who does above and beyond for our child."]}
