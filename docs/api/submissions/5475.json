I graduated early and got a job in my field and am doing okay for myself. \n\nAdam, on the other hand, went to a local community college for three years (he had to retake multiple courses) before transferring to an expensive university out of state. He then spent four more years getting his bachelor's degree and lived in a fancy apartment off campus, burning through 90% of his college fund in the process.  \n\nNow Adam had changed his mind about working in the field he got his degree in and wants to get a post-bacc certificate and then go to grad school in a completely different subject. He only has about 6k of his college fund left as he has never had a job and has been living off his college money. \n\nLast night my father and Adam approached me asking if I would sign my college fund over to Adam to help pay for his graduate school because I \"don't need the money\" now that I am working. I refused because I have thought about going to graduate school myself in the future, or hanging onto the fund and signing it over to my child if I ever have one. \n\nBoth my father and brother are very upset with me as now Adam will have to take out student loans and my father says he will have to postpone his retirement in order to support my brother through school.  Adam has been blowing up my phone and calling me selfish/ accusing me of trying to \"sabotage his future\" because I'm jealous that he went to a better university than me where he was very popular socially ( which I could not give less of a shit about??) \n\nI am now starting to get pressure from other family members to \"do the right thing\" and help my brother because I am financially comfortable and have a good job. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671826298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztrf1p/aita_for_not_sharing_my_college_fund_with_my/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do NOT allow him to burn through your cushion as well.", "Nta\n\n\nIf they want to help him they can. It's your father's decision not to retire and instead give him more money.\n\n\nHe should be pissed at your brothers lack of responsibility and make him own up to his mistakes. \n\n\n\n120 k is a nice amount. That money with the right choices could last his entire education. \n\n\nHe made mistakes. I would go low contact for awhile.  But don't give them the money", "NTA his education is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Adam made his choices and it's not your issue.", " NTA OP and please don't budge. You are not responsible for your brothers choices in life. HE made his decision so HE needs to figure his shit out. You use that money for You and your possible children's futures. He is not entitled to YOUR gift. I would block anyone saying otherwise.", "NTA. Since he puts so much value on his \"popularity\" at such a \"great school\" then he can either... start a gofundme and see how many of his pals that he was so popular with want to help him out or he can use that \"great diploma\" to get himself a great job and budget for a return to school for his new goal. Not your responsibility to fund his poor choices.", "NTA, it would be throwing good money after bad anyway.  You should save for your kids.", "NTA.  You were responsible in managing your money.  Your brother wasn't.  You did everything you could to save the money while he blew through his.  There's no guarantee that you will always have a good job and/or be financially comfortable.  Life happens so you are right to hold on to the money.  Besides, you mentioned you might want to go to grad school in the future.  In order to do that, you might want to take time off from working so you can focus on your studies.  You could also choose to set the money aside for a future child or children.\n\nClearly, you have no reason to be jealous of your brother.  If anything, he sounds like he's jealous of you because you have your life together and he's still trying to figure out how to grow up.  Your father doesn't have to delay retirement.  Nothing says he has to keep supporting your brother's educational efforts (or lack thereof, since it sounds like he spent more time socializing than studying).  In fact, your brother might do better if your father stopped supporting him and made him stand on his own two feet.", "NTA - It\u2019s not your problem that you made better life choices.", "NTA. Not your circus, not your clown, not your responsibility.", "NTA at all omg. Save your money and do not sign anything!! Both your brother and father seem very manipulative from a financial standpoint and neither should have ever asked you to sign your money over. If you haven\u2019t already, I would suggest meeting with a financial advisor or planner and seeing how you can put your money in a long term index fund so you can have a great investment for your future.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you made certain sacrifices to use/save your money wisely and your brother made very different decisions that led to him wasting a lot of the money he'd been given. \n\nIn my opinion, \"the right thing\" is to let your adult brother deal with the consequences of his decisions. By attempting to shield him from the consequences of his decisions he likely to continue making even worse ones in the future. \n\nWhile I could be off base here, it sounds like he's probably the golden child who has been getting preferential treatment for a long time... the way your family is pressuring you to pay the price for **his** bad choices is not healthy nor is it how you should treat loved ones. And it certainly isn't doing your brother any favors because he's turned into an entitled adult who squandered $120k with nothing to show for it. Will you be expected to pay for his wedding, his children's college tuitition, and his retirement, too?", "NTA and you should cut these people out of your life.  Anyone who would advocate for you to give up your security (when you were very responsible) to the irresponsible kid who squandered his money does not have your best interest at heart.  Adam is exactly the example of why so many people are against cancelling student loan debt when others managed to forge their way successfully without wracking it up.  Cut them out of your life without any cognitive dissonance and go on with your bad self because you are an independent Queen.", "NTA\nTell him the facts:\nBoth of you got the same money. You took some decisions so you didn't spend all of it yet. You sacrificed some quality in lifestyle to save some money for your future. You didn't sacrifice these years so he can waste your money too.\n\nHe had the same chances. He didn't proof that he would be worth to get your money too. It's not like he was sick. He spent the money like he decided to and it's important that he learns that money does not grow on trees. He already was lucky to have so much money for his studies.", "NTA. Adam had the exact same amount as you and he spent it; that is not your fault and you shouldn't be penalized for it. If your grandparents had wanted one of you to have more, they'd have set it up that way. Your dad is also full of shit - he doesn't HAVE to do anything as Adam is an adult who can get jobs or take out loans, so if your dad's retirement is affected it's because he CHOOSES that.", "NTA. He was given the same amount of money as you, it\u2019s not your fault he made bad choices and blew through it.", "NTA. You were responsible with your money and he wasn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean he gets access to your funds. That\u2019s just silly thinking on both your brother and father\u2018s end (and any other family members they roped into this).", "So because he USED his college fund for the colleges of his own choice... your the AH??? WHAT \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA. Not your fault he decided to do something else. Not your fault he failed his classes. Not your fault he chose to do the $$ side of college. That was allllll him. And your dad doesn't have to help. He is choosing to help. Or saying it to guilt you. DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING AND WATCH IT. Call the bank and put a security code on it if they will let you. Basically you need a signature and a code. Or you can tell them you want it where you have to come in and sign. Meaning, show them your ID.", "The right thing is for you to do what you want with YOUR college fund. You have no obligation to give it to him. Just note that, depending upon how the account is setup, it may not be up to you to decide how it is spent.\n\nNTA. He blew through his money and regrets it and is now blaming you because he can't manage his own affairs.", "NTA, Adam will burn through however much money he is given so it's best for everyone if the free ride stops now", "NTA. \n\nYou were given the money by your grandparents. If it was just a pool of money your parents put aside, it would be up to them. \n\nWhile it's easy to say hey, share a little with your brother, I'd worry that it will become a pattern until the fund is depleted. \n\nStick with saying you're considering graduate school. Claiming you *might* need it for *possible* kids just sounds too vague.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your family are behaving like massive AHs. You were given equal funds. You were responsible with yours and still have it for your future. Your brother lived it up and now has no money left. His failure, not yours. You are not responsible for his poor choices.", "Wow can't believe he has the support of ur dad and other family members nta", "NTA. Decisions are consequences are part of being an adult.", "NTA\n\nHow can you be jealous of someone who spent all their money because they couldn\u2019t decide what they wanted? Lol. Silly\n\nKeep your money. If your father wants to go into debt over someone who can\u2019t seem to commit to one thing, that\u2019s his problem. \n\nDo not give them your money.", "NTA.  For all of the above reasons.  If these people won\u2019t leave you be, block them.  Try talking to your dad.  You made responsible choices. Adam did not.  It\u2019s not your responsibility to provide for him.  Sounds like he just wants to postpone working toward his own goals.  Also, sounds like dad is an enabler.  Why would he postpone retirement to support a person who refuses to get a job to support himself?  It\u2019s your money, money you may need at sometime in the future.\nDon\u2019t give either of them a cent.\n\nEdit:  OMG.  I missed the part where you are jealous of your brother. Let\u2019s see you rec\u2019d scholarships, lived at home and got a job in your field, and still have 120k to further your education if you want.  He went to a better Uni (his words) squandered his money. Had to retake classes cause he had too much fun and now wants to get a different degree using your money.  He\u2019s a joke!!", "Woooooowww wowowow. NTA. That\u2019s your money and you were responsible with it. Can you use it for a down payment? \n\nAdam needs to become an adult and your Dad should NOT be funding his education addiction and trying to guilt YOU. If this money didn\u2019t exist, you\u2019d both have been on your own.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBOTH of you got the same. KEEP YOURS.", "NTA don\u2019t let them bully you. Who deserves that money more? Your loser brother or your kid? I think saving it for a child is a wonderful idea. Your grandparents would be proud.", "NTA.  Absolutely not.  Do not reward your brother's carelessness.  Protect yourself and your future.", "> he will have to postpone his retirement in order to support my brother through school\n\nSo your brother is getting preferential treatment. Tell your father you want the same as what Adam is being given. \n\nIn another universe I\u2019d feel sorry for your brother. The US student debt situation is horrifying to me (a non-American) and if you weren\u2019t lucky enough to know what field you wanted to pursue in high school, or have the teachers and guidance counsellors to help you choose one, then you may well do your best but still end up needing to retrain and it\u2019s unaffordable.\n\nBut this whole post screams that what happened to him wasn\u2019t bad luck, it was his bad attitude and entitlement. Your father will never retire, he will be supporting Adam through failed venture after failed venture and when he dies, I wouldn\u2019t put it past Adam to try to sell his organs on the black market before lifting a finger of his own. Don\u2019t get sucked into that. You made smart choices and your brother is not one. NTA.", "NTA your brother is so entitled and your father is enabling him. Your grandparents gave you the money not your father. Your brother needs to get a job.", "NTA. Tell him to get a job and apply for scholarships. Also tell him it\u2019s his own fault for blowing through all that money.", "NTA.  Do not give in. Grandma funded both your colleges' education. You each got a bachelor's. After that, your perpetual student brother decided to change fields and do postgraduate, too. That's not on Grandma or you. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't want to pay for your grad school later. Just keep telling them the money was given for your education and you are still using it. Just more wisely. This is entirely bull shite. Put it in a 2 or 3 year CD.  I can't believe your dad's audacity.", "Funding perpetual students is expensive.  I've known a few.  He was given the same amount of money that you were, he just didn't use it as wisely as you.  And you still have possible future student obligations if you go the graduate route, which is even more expensive per year.  And your own personal nuclear future family will thank you 25+ years later when you send your own kids off to college.", "Your brother is 24 and has never worked a day in his life? Nta.", "NTA.  Yeah, you\u2019re really jealous of a begging asshole.  Have everyone asking you to do the right thing set an example and give them thousands of dollars from money they saved.", "NTA. Adam\u2019s poor money management skills are not your problem. If he wants to go to grad school, then he needs to get a job and support himself through that.\n\nEdit: Also, hypothetically, if you did give the money, there\u2019s a good chance that him going to grad school wouldn\u2019t change anything. You said that he has a degree and he\u2019s never had a job. I don\u2019t think that him going to grad school will change this.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe how many posts I\u2019ve read about family literally demanding other people\u2019s money.  It always brings out the worst in people when they see someone has more than they do and use the family excuse to try and guilt them into handing over their money.  Don\u2019t give him a dime and honestly block his number and any other family member that tries to guilt you.", "They are upset b/c the EASIEST way for Adam to get money-and possibly waste it, again-is for you to sign over your $$.\n\n  Adam is 24 and needs to go get a loan, and possibly work part-time. But, once again, he wants the easy/fun way. He'll get a nice apartment, probably take his time getting this new degree, (if ever)\\~on your inheritance. \n\n  Stand your ground. He got his money and wasted it. Too bad for him.", "NTA Clearly state at ANYONE who asks or comments that you are saving it for your own return to grad school.", "NTA.
