I graduated early and got a job in my field and am doing okay for myself. \n\nAdam, on the other hand, went to a local community college for three years (he had to retake multiple courses) before transferring to an expensive university out of state. He then spent four more years getting his bachelor's degree and lived in a fancy apartment off campus, burning through 90% of his college fund in the process.  \n\nNow Adam had changed his mind about working in the field he got his degree in and wants to get a post-bacc certificate and then go to grad school in a completely different subject. He only has about 6k of his college fund left as he has never had a job and has been living off his college money. \n\nLast night my father and Adam approached me asking if I would sign my college fund over to Adam to help pay for his graduate school because I \"don't need the money\" now that I am working. I refused because I have thought about going to graduate school myself in the future, or hanging onto the fund and signing it over to my child if I ever have one. \n\nBoth my father and brother are very upset with me as now Adam will have to take out student loans and my father says he will have to postpone his retirement in order to support my brother through school.  Adam has been blowing up my phone and calling me selfish/ accusing me of trying to \"sabotage his future\" because I'm jealous that he went to a better university than me where he was very popular socially ( which I could not give less of a shit about??) \n\nI am now starting to get pressure from other family members to \"do the right thing\" and help my brother because I am financially comfortable and have a good job. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671826298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztrf1p/aita_for_not_sharing_my_college_fund_with_my/", "score": 618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your circus, not your clown, not your responsibility.", "NTA at all omg. Save your money and do not sign anything!! Both your brother and father seem very manipulative from a financial standpoint and neither should have ever asked you to sign your money over.

By attempting to shield him from the consequences of his decisions he likely to continue making even worse ones in the future. \n\nWhile I could be off base here, it sounds like he's probably the golden child who has been getting preferential treatment for a long time... the way your family is pressuring you to pay the price for **his** bad choices is not healthy nor is it how you should treat loved ones.

Anyone who would advocate for you to give up your security (when you were very responsible) to the irresponsible kid who squandered his money does not have your best interest at heart.

You didn't sacrifice these years so he can waste your money too.\n\nHe had the same chances. He didn't proof that he would be worth to get your money too. It's not like he was sick. He spent the money like he decided to and it's important that he learns that money does not grow on trees. He already was lucky to have so much money for his studies.", "NTA. Adam had the exact same amount as you and he spent it; that is not your fault and you shouldn't be penalized for it. If your grandparents had wanted one of you to have more, they'd have set it up that way.

Meaning, show them your ID.", "The right thing is for you to do what you want with YOUR college fund. You have no obligation to give it to him.

Claiming you *might* need it for *possible* kids just sounds too vague.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your family are behaving like massive AHs. You were given equal funds.

You are not responsible for his poor choices.", "Wow can't believe he has the support of ur dad and other family members nta", "NTA. Decisions are consequences are part of being an adult.", "NTA\n\nHow can you be jealous of someone who spent all their money because they couldn\u2019t decide what they wanted? Lol.

For all of the above reasons.  If these people won\u2019t leave you be, block them.  Try talking to your dad.  You made responsible choices. Adam did not.  It\u2019s not your responsibility to provide for him.  Sounds like he just wants to postpone working toward his own goals.  Also, sounds like dad is an enabler.  Why would he postpone retirement to support a person who refuses to get a job to support himself?  It\u2019s your money, money you may need at sometime in the future.\nDon\u2019t give either of them a cent.\n\nEdit:  OMG.  I missed the part where you are jealous of your brother. Let\u2019s see you rec\u2019d scholarships, lived at home and got a job in your field, and still have 120k to further your education if you want.  He went to a better Uni (his words) squandered his money. Had to retake classes cause he had too much fun and now wants to get a different degree using your money.  He\u2019s a joke!!", "Woooooowww wowowow. NTA. That\u2019s your money and you were responsible with it. Can you use it for a down payment? \n\nAdam needs to become an adult and your Dad should NOT be funding his education addiction and trying to guilt YOU. If this money didn\u2019t exist, you\u2019d both have been on your own.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBOTH of you got the same. KEEP YOURS.", "NTA don\u2019t let them bully you. Who deserves that money more? Your loser brother or your kid? I think saving it for a child is a wonderful idea. Your grandparents would be proud.", "NTA.  Absolutely not.  Do not reward your brother's carelessness.  Protect yourself and your future.", "> he will have to postpone his retirement in order to support my brother through school\n\nSo your brother is getting preferential treatment. Tell your father you want the same as what Adam is being given. \n\nIn another universe I\u2019d feel sorry for your brother. The US student debt situation is horrifying to me (a non-American) and if you weren\u2019t lucky enough to know what field you wanted to pursue in high school, or have the teachers and guidance counsellors to help you choose one, then you may well do your best but still end up needing to retrain and it\u2019s unaffordable.\n\nBut this whole post screams that what happened to him wasn\u2019t bad luck, it was his bad attitude and entitlement. Your father will never retire, he will be supporting Adam through failed venture after failed venture and when he dies, I wouldn\u2019t put it past Adam to try to sell his organs on the black market before lifting a finger of his own. Don\u2019t get sucked into that. You made smart choices and your brother is not one. NTA.", "NTA your brother is so entitled and your father is enabling him. Your grandparents gave you the money not your father. Your brother needs to get a job.", "NTA. Tell him to get a job and apply for scholarships. Also tell him it\u2019s his own fault for blowing through all that money.", "NTA.  Do not give in. Grandma funded both your colleges' education. You each got a bachelor's. After that, your perpetual student brother decided to change fields and do postgraduate, too. That's not on Grandma or you. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't want to pay for your grad school later. Just keep telling them the money was given for your education and you are still using it. Just more wisely. This is entirely bull shite. Put it in a 2 or 3 year CD.  I can't believe your dad's audacity.", "Funding perpetual students is expensive.  I've known a few.  He was given the same amount of money that you were, he just didn't use it as wisely as you.  And you still have possible future student obligations if you go the graduate route, which is even more expensive per year.  And your own personal nuclear future family will thank you 25+ years later when you send your own kids off to college.", "Your brother is 24 and has never worked a day in his life? Nta.", "NTA.  Yeah, you\u2019re really jealous of a begging asshole.  Have everyone asking you to do the right thing set an example and give them thousands of dollars from money they saved.", "NTA. Adam\u2019s poor money management skills are not your problem.

You said that he has a degree and he\u2019s never had a job. I don\u2019t think that him going to grad school will change this.", "NTA.
