So I (16F) always get complains from my sister (25F) about my nose for a few years now.She always makes comments about it whenever we meet. Yesterday me and my parents visited her. While i was playing with my nephew my sister took a picture of me and showed it to my mom saying:\"From who she got this nose from? We all have normal noses except her\". This isn't the first time she have done this, in other occasions she also said things like \"I can't stand seeing your nose, you MUST get surgery when you are older so ppl wont laugh at you\" (but she is the only one who has ever made comments about my nose lol). She always keeps saying how ugly and big my nose it. For ppl wondering, i got my nose from my aunt, we have the same nose shape.But this time i snapped because i couldn't hold it anymore and said \"Maybe if you can comment on my apperance you can also start losing some weight, your shirt can't hold your belly\". She started to get mad , telling me that it was a joke and that i shouldn't insult her. I told her that nobody laughed so it isn't  a joke. She said that I shouldn't judge her because she gave birth this year and I have no excuses to be an asshole. My mom took my side and said that my sister should stop complaining about my appearance and to mind her own business.\nSo am I the a hole for insulting my sister?", "created_utc": 1702899504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l6oif/aita_for_insulting_my_sister_because_she_kept/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
