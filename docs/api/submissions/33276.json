This isn't the first time she have done this, in other occasions she also said things like \"I can't stand seeing your nose, you MUST get surgery when you are older so ppl wont laugh at you\" (but she is the only one who has ever made comments about my nose lol). She always keeps saying how ugly and big my nose it. For ppl wondering, i got my nose from my aunt, we have the same nose shape.But this time i snapped because i couldn't hold it anymore and said \"Maybe if you can comment on my apperance you can also start losing some weight, your shirt can't hold your belly\".
