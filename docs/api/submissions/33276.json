How is sis overweight but can\u2019t eat off the same plate she dishes out to everyone else?", "NTA your sister shouldn\u2019t dish it out if she can\u2019t take it. You let her off easy. Your sister is a classic cry bully. If she does it again, make it even meaner.", "NTA, but if you want to be petty: \nEvery time you see her baby tell her how much they look like you. Point to their little squishy nose and say \u201clook, they take after me!\u201d", "NTA.  If she does it again, ask her who her plastic surgeon is and how long of a recovery she had. Then act disbelieving when she denies she's had a nose job.", "NTA, at all.", "NTA - I hope you don't accept her comments at all. I have a niece with a beautiful face because her nose is large.

I\u2019m sorry your sister is being so unkind to you. She\u2019s behaving much more like a jealous younger sibling than a grown older one.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware but there\u2019s a very famous singer and actress who has a very distinctive nose.

[Here is one of her best loved songs.](https://youtu.be/hkBziLvefsw?si=mS3xrVFwpIjMejZD)\n\nShe was strongly advised to have plastic surgery when she was first starting out but she refused. People in the industry cautioned her that she\u2019d never be a success without surgery but she stood firm.\n\nI hope you consider just as carefully before making any decisions about changing your looks. What is a \u201cflaw\u201d to a jealous sister can also be the feature loved best by a husband or the fondest memory of a child.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA and I wish you all the happiness in the world.", "NTA \n\nFAFO in action. \n\nWell done, OP!", "NTA and some women with distinctive noses have become known as the world's greatest beauties!

Your mother should have put a stop to this years ago.

She FAFO.", "NTA. Give as good as you get and you did. I would do that EVERY LAST TIME she was mean to you. For fun pick a different body part each time and it doesnt have to be true, you just need to laugh out loud at your own \"joke\" about her. \n\nFYI, there are many men out there that love a strong nose. I know because I'm one of them. Those \"cute little noses\"? Yuck. So be strong and taunt her right back.

After a time or two of this she never commented again. my Mom however chastised me as the older sibling for sinking to her level especially as an adult. But I don't regret it one bit because my sister has kept her rude comments to herself.", "There are few things more elegant than a young face surrounded by grey or white hair.  Swoonworthy and distinctive elegance and beauty!  And now I'm jealous.  My greys are coming in long after the wrinkles have had their way with me, so it's all of a piece, lol."]}
