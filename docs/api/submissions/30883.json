But the fact that you\u2019ve told him it\u2019s making you feel jealous (my words, not yours) and insecure, is something he should take into consideration.\n  I myself am middle aged now and been married for over twenty years. It has occurred to me that most male female relationships/friendships do often have an element of one or both of the parties wanting to be more then friends (often it\u2019s the man, but I\u2019ve seen it go both ways).\n So, in that respect I do think you are warranted in feeling insecure about this friendship, even if it\u2019s just a coworker/friends. If it were my wife asking for me to cut the extra chat time off I would. But only out of respect for her feelings and not because the new friendship was growing towards something more serious. However, I wouldn\u2019t make a new friendship with a female coworker  outside of work hours.

He should\u2019ve taken initiative and lessened the chats right then. The female coworker has a husband and family of her own as well and should be aware (as a fellow married woman) that this amount of contact could make her coworkers (your husband) spouse (you) uncomfortable and she should also reevaluate the kind of bond they are forming.
