That wasn\u2019t part of my culture and I never understood the point of spending so much money in a party anyway, but we did save up for a while to throw my daughter one \u2013 until my daughter herself said a few months ago that she doesn't want a party and would prefer to spend that money on a trip. It will be a 30-day tour to Europe with a group of teenagers, including some school friends.\n\nHere's the thing\u2026 My daughter has a twin brother. Of course my son wouldn\u2019t get a quincea\u00f1era even though they celebrate their birthday on the same day, because the party is just for girls - but since the party turned into a birthday trip, he's upset and feeling left out. I tried to explain to him I'm not so financially comfortable right now to send both of them (I could find a way, but I honestly don't want to spend anything beyond the \"quincea\u00f1era fund\"). He lashed out and told me his mother and I always favor his sister over him, which is very unfair. I then told him my father never paid for any of my trips and the first time I went abroad I was already an adult and did it with my own money - if that's what he wants, I suggested he could maybe look for a job.\n\nI get that I was harsh, but his sense of entitlement really threw me off...

That wasn\u2019t part of my culture and I never understood the point of spending so much money in a party anyway, but we did save up for a while to throw my daughter one \u2013 until my daughter herself said a few months ago that she doesn't want a party and would prefer to spend that money on a trip. It will be a 30-day tour to Europe with a group of teenagers, including some school friends. \n\nHere's the thing\u2026 My daughter has a twin brother. Of course my son wouldn\u2019t get a quincea\u00f1era even though they celebrate their birthday on the same day, because the party is just for girls - but since the party turned into a birthday trip, he's upset and feeling left out. I tried to explain to him I'm not so financially comfortable right now to send both of them (I could find a way, but I honestly don't want to spend anything beyond the \"quincea\u00f1era fund\"). He lashed out and told me his mother and I always favor his sister over him, which is very unfair. I then told him my father never paid for any of my trips and the first time I went abroad I was already an adult and did it with my own money - if that's what he wants, I suggested he could maybe look for a job.\n\nI get that I was harsh, but his sense of entitlement really threw me off...

I also come from a culture where we do this quincea\u00f1era and I'll offer some perspective on how we balance these things in the family: one option, when the girl wants to go on a trip instead of throwing a party, is, yes, going on a toured trip with other girls the same age, OR, for the same money you spend on those expensive trips, do the same but as a family. I guess it's too late for that because it seems you already booked that. The other common thing is, the girl gets her party/teenager trip, and the boy gets a car when he's 18.

Usually you know that's happens, because everyone talks about it all the time. When the boys start getting older, people start talking about the big bash they're going to get when they turn 18. Or you start attending the parties of your cousins. And obviously the younger ones (ave 15-16) want to attend the party of the 18 year old one, though they can't drink, and you can always sneak in half a bottle of beer from someone and drink that. \n\nI don't think it's entitlement on the part of OP's son, though I admit I never thought about how the boys felt when the girls got all the attention at 15. Like, it's a huge deal. It used to be that the girl walks down a flight of stairs in this huge wedding like dress, and then there's a father/daughter dance, and then she might have a \"chambelan\", like either her date or boyfriend, or guy she really likes that she will then dance with. Then for the party of it, most girls get a 2nd dress that's either smaller or tighter or shows more skin, and they dance with that dress the rest of the night.", "This. I'm mexican too.

Right. Here. I agree with you ma\u2019am. OP you need to understand that both these kids share that birthday EQUALLY, so anything you do for one, you have to do for the other.

It wouldn't even matter if they were different ages and not twins. Only cheap assholes or parents who have an obvious favorite would even consider doing what OP plans on doing.

Maybe others would feel differently, but I don't think it'd bother me.\n\nHowever, being excluded from a month long trip to a different continent? Yeah, that'd definitely burn.
