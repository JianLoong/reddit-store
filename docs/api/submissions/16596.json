By this, I mean put the pile of cards between you and pick one up, read it out loud, and put it down in front of the one who does the chore. \n\n\u201cGet the kids ready for school on Monday.

It's been shown that men see the mess just fine, they just don't feel it's their problem and they assume the woman will direct them as to what to do when, so they don't do anything until they're told.

Leave him one plate, bowl, mug, knife, fork, spoon (as with the towels, ideally ones that already need cleaning).

And right now they are learning that mommy does all the housework and daddy doesn\u2019t do shit. \n\nWhat do you think will happen when they grow up and get into relationships?", "He is not showing you anything because by \"not doing his 50%,\" of course nothing will change! \n\nYOU need to stop doing your ~~50~~ 90%. Only launder, dishes, cook for you and the kids. And obviously take care of the pets because he won't. Do not make food for him, only do your dishes, etc. If he's all hungry, shrug or tell him he can make a sandwich. If his clothes are all dirty, he knows where the washing machine is. Force yourself to not wash his dishes. (And since he will just use your clean ones, I recommend going paper plate/plastic cutlery for a while. I know, bad for the environment, but this situation is bad for you and the kids.)\n\nI don't normally think going nuclear is right, but he is not only not pulling his weight--for his own home, kids and pets--but he *actually* thinks you're going to fold. And he does way, way less than most lazy people we see here. He does almost NOTHING. \n\nPlease update us.", "Throw it back at him...you've had your days 'off' now it's my turn...see how long it takes for the penny to drop.", "I want to flip your question around on you and ask how long you\u2019re going to put up with his childishness. The way he\u2019s weaponizing his silence is abusive. I am surprised that you are not refocusing on how little he brings to your relationship/household. You\u2019re just waiting for him to come to his senses and see how much you are worth to him. A lot of women would be re-examining their actual marriage and what it\u2019s worth to them. I think you owe it to yourself to reframe the situation and ask yourself honestly how much a partner, who does so little and treats you in a demeaning way, is worth to you.", "He won\u2019t notice until YOU stop doing it for him. Go on strike. Don\u2019t do his laundry, don\u2019t cook his meals, don\u2019t wash his dishes, don\u2019t take the trash out - none of it. Obviously feed and clean the kids but keep things to an absolute minimum. It is the only way he will start to see it, and if he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to.", "I know this term gets overused a lot these days, but these sound like narcissistic traits. Also, he just got out of doing chores for a while by deciding to ignore you. The behavior of ignoring someone like he has been is supposed to be a way of punishing you, if in fact it's a narcissistic move. If he was ignoring you because you actually did something hurtful, then I wouldn't comment.", "There\u2019s a difference in his perceived  contribution toward household chores and what it means to be a parent - so that stunt not parenting his child would tip me over the edge.\n\nYou need to talk, and tell him nothing has changed during his protest other than he\u2019s been silent and refusing to be a parent, if he won\u2019t listen then I guess it\u2019s more serious business. I\u2019d be tempted to go and stay with a friend or family for a week and let him work it out for himself (but I am petty).", "Nta. But lady you are the one who needs to go on strike. Stop doing his laundry and the kids if they are older. Stop cooking. Stop doing dishes that aren\u2019t yours. Stop picking up.  Just stop. Show him what he\u2019s not helping with.", "> I\u2019m now getting angry that he thinks it\u2019s okay to give me the silent treatment for two days now.\n\nThis should be making you angry, it isn\u2019t an okay way to treat your spouse. NTA, DTMFA", "Check out the Fair Play book and cards. It's designed for exactly this kind of situation.", "Maybe sit down with him and each of you privately wrote down what you do, share your lists and then approach it as a shared challenge on how to divide all the work? Make it an \"us vs the problem\" rather than the two of you facing off against each other. \n\nI think it would also be worth marriage counselling too.", "Plz tell him you agree that he does 50/50 - he gets these two weeks and you will do 100%. And then the next 2 weeks you will do nothing and he will pick up everything. It will remain 50/50 on a monthly basis. You must restrain yourself and not do anything on your two weeks off.", "Oh I bet it\u2019s both.", "Why would you wait until then? Your children are watching this dynamic and this is what they are learning : \n\n- men don\u2019t have to do anything, all work has to be done by the woman. \n- it\u2019s ok to be emotionally manipulative and throw tantrums as an adult \n- the silent treatment, a form of abuse, is an effective tool to make the other person apologize for daring to have an opinion.\n\nIs this what you want for them? Do you have a daughter? Do you want her to learn that this is what love and marriage is?", "Longer.  Most people have enough clothes to not do washing for 1 week.  And there might be enough food in the cupboard, fridge and freezer.  A \u201cfamily emergency\u201d to look after grandma for two weeks would do the trick, because you also need school events where he had to deal with more life admin", "Not to mention I was young and stupid when I got married.  It took having my second baby to realise that I was doing EVERYTHING.  Up to that point I felt I was really organised and efficient.", "That's the one. Thanks!", "No.", "You can't do that when you have children and pets. Kids need eat, have baths, get to school, have clean clothes, etc. Pets need to be fed, cleaned up after, etc.\n  \nMay I ask if you are a man? Because I think it's only men or women without pets or children who would think it's possible for OP to go 2 weeks without doing anything.", ">What do you think will happen when they grow up and get into relationships?\n\nThey'll know that their mum's life sucked because of it and choose to do it differently. Because humans don't just monkey-see-monkey-do everything, we can actually learn from the mistakes of others as well.", "No, homework would just not be done for a week and our son would fall behind.  Our teen is self sufficient.", "He needs to be aware that divorce is an option. If he knows that he can get away with doing nothing and you will continue to support him, nothing will change.", "Good on you for recognising that!\n\nI left my ex and suddenly had so much less work to do. It's an extremely common experience. You don't realise how much work taking care of another adult is until it's gone but my gosh is it a relief. 10/10 highly recommend. \n\nEven on the nights my toddler sleeps poorly or we're both sick, I'm still so much more relaxed and happy and everything is still easier than when I had \"help\". Seriously, if he's not an equal partner, life will probably be a lot easier without him. Not to mention that you won't be walking on eggshells anticipating his next tantrum or guilt trip. \n\nHard NTA and you deserve to be in an AH free home", "Listen 50/50 is truly the way to do it. She will have to ask if dog got fed - she will see that the kids are dressed or don\u2019t have clothes for school. You just make sure spouse has less underwear than the kids and it\u2019s fine.\n\nYou truly believe that doing this for two weeks is the end of the world. Nope! Men do it all the time and know it will be taken care of by the woman. Stop doing the dudes work\u2026\n\nTry it! You just don\u2019t have the appetite to watch how shit falls apart. You can\u2019t have a discussion with someone who believes they do 50/50 unless they know what 100% looks like.\n\nHad hubby pets and kids at various points in my life\u2026", "What? Of course it\u2019s possible for her to do nothing and the world won\u2019t end, what would happen if she got sick? Champion husband would have to step up, else kids don\u2019t get fed, bathed or taken to school.", "Umm, most men today grew up with working moms who also did much more than 50% of their share at home -- and that hasn't led to those men learning from the mistakes of others.\n  \nYou fail to realize the effects of being socialized to something from childhood. For example, children who grew up in abusive households are more likely to be victims of abuse or abusers themselves (or both) as adults than children who grow up in functional households. We tend to follow the patterns engrained on our brains from childhood.", "This is so true. I read a stat that said that unmarried women and married men live longer than married women and unmarried men. I believe it. It\u2019s not hard to read why."]}
