Even tell him to drop whatever he's doing if you see him do anything.\n\nIn exchange. You don't get to do anything for two weeks. Best thing would be if you leave the house for those two weeks.

It's been shown that men see the mess just fine, they just don't feel it's their problem and they assume the woman will direct them as to what to do when, so they don't do anything until they're told.

Leave him one plate, bowl, mug, knife, fork, spoon (as with the towels, ideally ones that already need cleaning).

If he only does it after dinner 4 nights a week, note that. It will clearly show who is doing the chores that keep your house functioning.

The stuff you mentioned here, the stuff that you end up doing and the few things that he actually does, from housecleaning to laundry, trash, yardwork, all the things around mealtime, what needs to be done for the kids, all your appointments, etc. Just write it all down in point form.\n\nThen wait until a time when you're feeling pretty calm and relaxed (I know, basically never, right?), maybe sometime in the evening or a weekend, when he or the kids haven't done anything in particular to annoy you, LOL . . . just a time when you can approach him in a way that YOU don't feel immediately anxious or irritated, so you won't be tempted to get defensive or snide (not because you don't have a right to, but because if you can come to him in the spirit of \"let's address this as a team\" then HE can't accuse you of \"attacking\" him or make excuses that you're \"being mean\").  \n\nAnd just say to him, very plainly: \"These are all the things that this household needs done in order to run smoothly. I genuinely believe that YOU feel that you are contributing equally in this marriage and this household, but I also think that there is some miscommunication and some misunderstanding, because I'm not sure you are entirely aware of all the things that happen 'under the radar' so to speak, that you don't even notice because they are being done quietly and without you having to worry about them. So I'd like you to look at this list and circle or check off how many of them you do REGULARLY (not as a favour, occasionally, but on a daily or weekly basis), from start to finish (not scraping dishes, for example, for someone else to wash, but scraping, loading the dishwasher, and emptying it). And then I'd like us to talk about whether things are really being done fairly, and if not, how we can make it more fair.\"\n\nAnd when he starts to protest, which he will, I would suggest that you (still calmly) say to him, \"You know, I get that it feels pretty bad to be accused of not being helpful, because it's not how you want to see yourself. But it also hurts me pretty badly when your reaction to my suggesting that you're not as helpful as you could be is to get MEAN and choose to help EVEN LESS on purpose, to 'punish' me.

I wouldnt put it past your husband to accuse you of cheating to get the upper hand, he has proven as much.", "Exactly right. And it\u2019s also why divorce isn\u2019t feasible. If I had divorced my husband when my kids were small, who knows what kind of care they would have received during his custody time. No way would I allow that. It\u2019s a rock and a hard place for sure.", "My eight year old is perfectly capable of finding his own clothes if they are put away for him. He struggles if they are still in laundry baskets mixed with everyone's laundry.\n\nThe laundry that I sort/fold 90% of the time because my wife who works part-time [understandably!] rarely gets around to folding it. I'd be surprised and impressed if OP gets it folded and put away regularly without help from her partner.", "Sounds like \u2026 your teen is more self sufficient than your husband?", "I propose doing this over their summer break from school. Bring the kids with you so they don\u2019t get neglected. Stay the whole summer with a family member.", "Is there anyone's \"preference\" to leave unfolded towels in baskets?", "No. This is some stupid shit you do with kids to get them to understand. If I had to do this with my spouse, I'd just ask for a trial separation and be done with it. Once OP figures out how much easier her life will be without him, she won't be interested in being married to a man who behaves and pouts like a child.", "Make a chart in private, but have HIM make one too, of all the things he thinks need to be done on a daily/weekly basis. Then trade charts. He does your chart, you do his chart.", "This right here. He also thinks he's going to keep pushing the OP until she pops and then he gets to point and laugh at how crazy she's acting. He honestly thinks he's going to break her and go right back to doing nothing the whole rest of their marriage.", "In case anyone would seriously consider this, be aware of what your state/province, etc. would consider abandonment before you leave your kids for a week without communicating anything.", "You think your partner would mistreat your pet or child?\n\nWhy are you with them??", "It's old enough to manage that decision and the consequences of it. So the kid is cold for a day, so what? Won't make that mistake again.", "Well the comment you replied to said that there is. In my own personal experience, I\u2019ve definitely come across multiple people that prefer it that way. I\u2019m related to some of those multiple people.", "You know, this is kind of off topic but the one thing that rubs me the wrong way about that dishes by the sink post, is that the author never makes the leap of logic that the woman is angry about the dishes by the sink because it increases the amount of work she has to do.\n\nHe kind of dances around it saying that men will never understand why the glass by the sink matters to women (or the dirty shoes on the clean floor, etc.) But that men should care because their partners care. This makes the woman seem petty and arbitrary and illogical.\n\nIts not rocket science: the glass will need to be cleaned. How will it get to the dishwasher if the man doesn't put it in there. Answer: the woman puts it in there. Who will clean up the dirty footprints? The person who has the chore of mopping (the woman in his scenario). It's adding tasks to her to do list which could have been easily avoided.\n\nIt's not: \"She divorced me because I disrespected her love by leaving dishes by the sink.\" It's: \"She divorced me because I made more work for her.\"", "OMG! This reminds me of the time I dumped a guy for drinking water out of six glasses in one night and not washing them and putting them away before he left. \ud83d\ude02\n\nOP, I\u2019m not saying to dump your husband, but I AM saying that you should NOT apologize on this one. You\u2019re NTA, and you deserve better.", "That one was long too. She's the glass person leaves em.everywhere. drives me nuts. But she hates dishes in the sink.", "\"men aren't children even though we act like them\"\n\nGod what a load of bullshit. Just because this dude acted like a ten year old doesn't make it acceptable to make the claim about every man.", "Fair enough if you wouldn't work on the situation. And it seems OP is done too. She stated in a  other comment that the resentment is through the roof and she fell out of love already. So there probably isn't a point to this. \n\nIdeally, an approach like this is never needed. \n\nBut sometimes people are oblivious and blind to the obvious and truly can't see it, if they haven't lived together with a partner or on their own before. But of course if this problem is encountered it should be addressed as soon as possibly after moving in together and not years down the line. \n\nIt doesn't always have to be a dealbreaker, if the person is understanding and truly takes steps to do better. Some parents failed their kids and it's sometimes hard to catch up on skills if you don't even know what you're missing.", "True. Makes me wonder why she really got divorced - because he was lazy, or just dense :D", "YES. This one always skeeved me out a little because he makes it this confusing, nebulous issue when it really isn't. It's as simple as \"clean your own shit up and stop treating your partner like your bangmaid,\" not \"*I* will never understand why she cares, but she does therefore it matters!\" \n\nIt's REALLY GODDAMN OBVIOUS why she cares!", "Yes! He's still just as fucking dense post divorce lol.\n\nIt's not about 'people coming over and seeing the glass' it's about him telling her by his inaction that it is her job to put his glass in the dishwasher or put his dirty clothes he left on the floor in the hamper. \n\nSeriously fuck this guy for STILL not getting it.", "There\u2019s a saying in couples therapy \u201cit\u2019s never about the dishes\u201d and the fact that people still think it is about the dishes are why they feel blind sided when their partner files for divorce.", "THANK YOU!!!\n\neveryone links this essay and praises it to high heaven and I want to scream every time I see it, because it so clearly misses the mark.\n\nNot leaving your dirty dishes laying around for your wife to pick  up and clean them for you is NOT some favor to her because that's how she feels loved. It's because it's your fucking dish and your are full ass adult and you should not need someone to follow you around cleaning up after you. Your laziness is making her life harder, because SOMEONE has to pick up and wash that dish. There's only two of you, so you are expecting her to do it because it's apparently beneath you.", "Omg this, when I first saw that blog post I was amazed by people sharing it cause.. that OP does not get it either. \"I have to do this because she **cares** that I do.\" It's not about *caring*, it's about pulling your weight ffs. A divorce is never because of 'just a glass being placed wrong'... The glass is probably one of many examples, but ended up being the last straw.", "Me too!!!!!! Every time it's posted it sets my teeth on edge. He's squarely placing the mental load for the household on her and then painting her as irrational for wanting to live in a tidy home and asking him to do his share. \n\nHe admits halfway through the article it wasn't just the glass it was all his mess and then acts like basic life skills are something you do just to appease your silly wife.", "NoT aLl MeN\n\nJfc be poud you're not like that and ask yourself how you can help to educate even more of your fellow men, so the trope can really die.\n\nComplaining \"But but it wasn't meeee!!1!\" is not a very adult look either.", "Tom is a 48 year old man\u2026", "Both. Or the guy was doing the good old weaponized incompetence and it backfired on him. Like he was well aware of what she wanted but was absolutely certain he could wear her down so she would do it and is now all pikachu face they\u2019re getting a divorce."]}
