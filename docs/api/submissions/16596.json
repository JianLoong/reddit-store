Even tell him to drop whatever he's doing if you see him do anything.\n\nIn exchange. You don't get to do anything for two weeks. Best thing would be if you leave the house for those two weeks.

By this, I mean put the pile of cards between you and pick one up, read it out loud, and put it down in front of the one who does the chore. \n\n\u201cGet the kids ready for school on Monday.

It's been shown that men see the mess just fine, they just don't feel it's their problem and they assume the woman will direct them as to what to do when, so they don't do anything until they're told. The biggest problem with this is it puts a serious mental load on the woman while the man just sits around doing nothing and thinking he's helping, somehow.

Leave him one plate, bowl, mug, knife, fork, spoon (as with the towels, ideally ones that already need cleaning).

If he only does it after dinner 4 nights a week, note that. It will clearly show who is doing the chores that keep your house functioning.

The stuff you mentioned here, the stuff that you end up doing and the few things that he actually does, from housecleaning to laundry, trash, yardwork, all the things around mealtime, what needs to be done for the kids, all your appointments, etc. Just write it all down in point form.\n\nThen wait until a time when you're feeling pretty calm and relaxed (I know, basically never, right?), maybe sometime in the evening or a weekend, when he or the kids haven't done anything in particular to annoy you, LOL . . . just a time when you can approach him in a way that YOU don't feel immediately anxious or irritated, so you won't be tempted to get defensive or snide (not because you don't have a right to, but because if you can come to him in the spirit of \"let's address this as a team\" then HE can't accuse you of \"attacking\" him or make excuses that you're \"being mean\").  \n\nAnd just say to him, very plainly: \"These are all the things that this household needs done in order to run smoothly. I genuinely believe that YOU feel that you are contributing equally in this marriage and this household, but I also think that there is some miscommunication and some misunderstanding, because I'm not sure you are entirely aware of all the things that happen 'under the radar' so to speak, that you don't even notice because they are being done quietly and without you having to worry about them. So I'd like you to look at this list and circle or check off how many of them you do REGULARLY (not as a favour, occasionally, but on a daily or weekly basis), from start to finish (not scraping dishes, for example, for someone else to wash, but scraping, loading the dishwasher, and emptying it). And then I'd like us to talk about whether things are really being done fairly, and if not, how we can make it more fair.\"\n\nAnd when he starts to protest, which he will, I would suggest that you (still calmly) say to him, \"You know, I get that it feels pretty bad to be accused of not being helpful, because it's not how you want to see yourself. But it also hurts me pretty badly when your reaction to my suggesting that you're not as helpful as you could be is to get MEAN and choose to help EVEN LESS on purpose, to 'punish' me.
