That's one of the most important details.  \n\n\nI have a friend who recently lost his house in a fire. His girlfriend is one of my best friends, and I love his kids even if they aren't the best behaved. He's getting assistance from a number of places, and his kids were with a relative over the weekend so he was staying with me and my partner for the weekend so he could save money for hotels for when his kids are with him. Before the fire, he was doing his laundry at my place and when the hot water was off he and his kids came over for showers. Since the fire, I told him that he can come over here and cook for his kids and take the food home, and when I'm off work I could have them all over for the evening so that they could sit here and be out of a hotel room and have dinner.  \n\n\nSince he was on his way to get his kids and sign into his hotel room today, he offered to drop my partner off at work. My partner gave him the apartment key because he was going to be coming back to grab some stuff he had here and I was at work so I may not be able to unlock the door. Even when we would give him or his girlfriend one of our keys to be able to get back into the apartment when we were helping them with something, I always let them know to let me know when they're here if i'm working. Because I work from home, and it's literally like, my home, I always like to know before somebody just walks in.   \n\n\nToday, after knowing that I didn't want three kids who don't really behave here making noise while I was working, he brought not only his own three kids but also one of his kids' friend. He didn't let me know he was coming back yet, he just came in with the key my partner gave him without a heads up knowing that I asked him to always let me know when he's coming in. He just brought them in and started making food. And on top of that, the kids were loud, the discipline for the kids was loud, and I feel like I'm justified but IDK. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know he's dealing with a lot right now, but I mean I've had my entire world crumble around me and have had to rely on the kindness of others and I've never thought to treat someone else's home like my own or that previously established rules are now null and void because there has been a tragedy. I feel like I'm doing enough to help a friend even before the fire and what he's doing is a little rude..\r  \n\n\n\r  \nI'm going to tell him that we have to have a talk about boundaries and communication, and that he is no longer allowed to have any of the kids over while I'm at work.

But frankly, you already told him this and he ignored it. Take the key back. Give him your work hours again, and let him contact you outside those hours if he wants to come over.", "Ugh, sounds like a real shitshow. Definitely not cool of him to just barge in with his whole crew without giving you a heads up. You're totally justified in setting some boundaries and telling him no more kids while you're working. NTA for sure.", "No.\n\nYou home.\n\nYour job.\n\nYour livelihood. \n\nYour rules.", "NTA - remind him that the W in WFH stands for WORK !  \nWould he take 4 kids to someone\u2019s workplace ?  \nA factory ?  \nAn office ?  \nA building site ? \nI\u2019m guessing the answer is no", "NAH I think it's completely reasonable to set a no-kid boundary while you're working. You sound like a great friend", "NAH. And you are the kind of friend more people would love to have.  If I personally has to have this conversation I wouldn't personally say 'your kids cannot be here while I am working, because that assumes that the kids CANT be behaved, even if that's true.\n\nI would approach it like \"when I'm working, I CANNOT have unprofessional noises disrupting calls/concentration/etc..., your kids have to be quiet...quiet to a point that I realize is not fair to a kid...that being said, you are always welcome, but maybe it's best to find them a productive place to get their energy out during working hours.  Puts the ball in his court, without feeling too dogpiled by life.\n\nGood luck man", "NAH. Honestly, this seems easily fixable with some communication. Establish your boundaries one more time and let him know YOUR rules and make them very clear so there is no confusion. You helping a friend is generous and in your post it seems it was just this one thing that upset you ? Maybe it was a miscommunication error or a last minute thing he wasn\u2019t preparing for? Again i don\u2019t know,so communicate and let him know YOU CAN NOT have the kids over during work hours and if he is going to bring them over during work hours then he really needs to tell them to lower their voices. If he can not follow those rules, you can let him know that no one will be able to come into your home until you are off from work.", "Your partner needs to be the one addressing this but NH for ur feelings", "That\u2019s a tough one", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
