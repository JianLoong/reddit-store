Alex was suppose to wear the dress she got which was sage green. Alex normally wears emo clothes at the moment, which is fine. Well she came down in the green dress and put a large slit in it that does up to her thigh. She also added a skull necklace, earnings, punk rock boots and really dark makeup. I told her to take that jewelry off quickly and give me the dress so I could fit the slit or at least make it shorter.\n\nAlex got mad and said it was fine and was in the dresscode. I told her no and that you will stand out. She refused again and i told her if she won't fix it then she can stay home. She refused again and she missed the wedding. Ashley understood why her sister wasn't here, but my husband was furious with me and called me a jerk. Alex is still not talking to me also\n\n \n\nEdit: Comments peoples said were relevant\n\nI got there really early before the wedding and brought the issue up in person, Ashley was still getting ready, that's when we had the conversation. She agreed it would be best.\n\nI also text my daughter that if she changes the outfit I could pick her up in time for the wedding, no response.\n\nI am fine with her expressing herself, she picked out the dress and she told me what she was gonna do for her makeup.\n\nThen the day of the wedding she did all of this. The slit was so high I could see her underwear is she walked fast, not to mention the jewelry was huge. i just don't get why she would do that, it was inappropriate to dress like that for the event, there is a time and place.\n\nNot to mention my Ashley was fine with Alex missing the wedding, she didn't want her there looking like that either", "created_utc": 1674325467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hxt5l/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_go_to_her/", "score": 4730, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her youngest daughter was attention seeking.", "NTA, it was attention seeking (even if that is her style) a wedding/formal event is not a time and place to express yourself. You were looking out for the bride/your daughter.", "NTA. This is no different than trying to bring a child to a child-free wedding. A rule is a rule, and she was expected to follow formal attire. She didn\u2019t, so she can sit this one out.\n\nYou mentioned you\u2019re fine with Alex expressing herself any other time. This definitely makes you NTA.

You said that both her outfit and makeup were discussed prior and deemed acceptable.

If the bride doesn\u2019t want her to be dressed like that, then she has to change or not go to the wedding.

A dress that I then cried in private about because I hated it. But you know what? I was suppose to stand up there while they got married. And I know how much it would mean for them to just be girly for a day, so I sucked it up and wore the damn dress and curled my hair. They didn\u2019t even have to force me, I just felt that I could at least do this on THEIR day.\n\n\nEDIT: When I said that \u201dthey didn\u2019t have to force me\u201d, I meant that they at no point said that my only option was a dress. To be honest, they didn\u2019t talk much about what I should wear until I myself brought it up and we sat down and looked for a dress. Right after the main part of the wedding was done, I switched into normal clothes and everyone was fine with that.\n\nWhat I was trying to say, is that I knew there was a specific way you\u2019re suppose to dress in a wedding. And I knew what my dad and stepmom would have liked seeing me in (even though they didn\u2019t say it), and I wanted to give them that.\n\nThis dids NOT mean that I believe OPs daughter should be forced into wearing a dress if that had been the problem. There\u2019s so many other ways someone can dress formally, that doesnt mean a dress or skirt. Had ops daughter been complaining about having to wear a dress, I probably would have given the post a Y.T.A. But that wasnt the problem. The problem was the daughter not wanting to dress \u201dformal\u201d. The reason why I brought my story up for comparing, is that I wanted to point out that sometimes we have to do things for others. Which means, maybe not emo on a wedding.", "NTA", "NTA. Mostly because it is NOT polite to pull attention away from the bride. Whether it's by choosing a monster goth necklace and huge boots, wearing a floofy white dress, announcing a pregnancy, giving a proposal, etc.  There are lots of less extreme things she could have done.

Get her to admit that and you're golden.", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here but 1). A slit showing underwear is too high for a 15 year old.\n2). Dress codes exist. If she went to private school she\u2019d have to adhere to one. If she gets a job she has to adhere to one. If she wants to go to high end restaurants or parties she has to adhere to them. It\u2019s not repressing individuality for crying out loud. It\u2019s living in society. If you don\u2019t want to adhere then you don\u2019t go. She chose not to. That\u2019s fine. Doesn\u2019t make you TA.\n\nThat being said I\u2019m hoping your edit with \u201cmy Ashley\u201d is a typo because if not you\u2019re definitely playing favorites and you are TA for that.", "This sounds worse than wearing white to a wedding.  NTA.", "NTA. I was and am an eccentric dresser.  I love dark things,  dark makeup,  I'm not emo but I guess I could fit in with that crowd.  I live in combat boots and will wear them with formal dresses.  I'm 36 with two teen boys of my own.  One is an emo dresser one is not.  For things like family pictures and even church I let them dress how they want because I want them to be themselves like my parents allowed me. However,  for something like someone else's wedding,  no.  When I was 15 I was at the height of my goth phase,  and even I would wear a pale blue or floral dress for weddings.  Because the wedding wasn't about me.  Same with my kids,  for formal events,  it's not about them.  Sure my oldest will still wear a chain or something \"edgy\" but within reason. You have to learn when it's appropriate and her sisters wedding was not the place for flashing her panties.  The makeup and jewelry I probably would have been OK with,  but her modifying what I'm presuming was an expensive dress is a big no.  She has to learn it's OK to be yourself,  but sometimes you put your own preferences away for a day for people you love.", "NTA but why the \u201cmy Ashley\u201d in the edit?", "NTA - she didn't want her sister to have all of the attention that's why she did it.

It was important to Ashley so it makes sense. \n\nBut this is one of those, \u201cSeriously, why do you care?\u201d moments for me. Ten years from now, you\u2019ll be more charmed and amused by Alex\u2019s clumsy youthful attempts at rebellion than whatever now-pathetically-dated clothes you planned to stick her in for the wedding.\n\nIf people stopped seeing their weddings as choreographed shows where everyone has to be in perfect costume, they\u2019d be happier and enjoy themselves more.", "Need more info...\n\nWhat would her sister have wanted you to do?  How would she have felt with it being her wedding?", "You need to talk to your daughter, she clearly either feels neglected and wants your attention, or feels like you don't respect her tastes and choices enough to feel justified in pulling this stunt. \n\nShe's old enough where she knows that this would be attention grabbing and rude, so you need to talk to her and find the reason on why she felt justified to do that. Definitely NTA for stopping her in making your other kid uncomfortable on her wedding though.", "NTA, there\u2019s no compromise when it comes to wedding attire and what the bride/groom approve of. Eldest daughter agreed it would be best for Alex to stay home. Which is perfectly reasonable because a massive slit up the side of a 15 year old girls dress, combat boots and heavy dark make up is distracting. You know your daughters and knew Ashley wouldn\u2019t approve of that attire. It was a tough decision but a wedding is a big event and Ashley deserves to have her wishes honored.

I'm not a prude and all for how people should dress, but a 15 year old doesn't need to be dressing revealingly .

Alex maybe a teenager but at 15 she can start to learn some social expectations for certain events and that actions have consequences. I can't find the link but this reminds me of a story where OP's sister or daughter did come dressed very risque as a guest for a wedding and then was upset years later that the big family wedding portrait was still displayed prominently because she was embarrassed about her look in the picture. OP refused to remove it because some of those family members were now deceased and she enjoyed the picture from that day as a whole.", "I see it's a bit of a mixed bag on this one.

I mean, all AITA posts are one sided and biased by the very nature...but this one is a little too much so for me to really trust what's going on.\n\nOPs story wavers too much. The slit (the only thing I have a firm opinion on) went from 'thigh high' to 'showing undies' (these two do not correlate). She dances around 'my Ashley' very disingenuously. The bride's so called veto is very sus, because even OP just reports that she raced to the venue to tattle to the bride (at a point where she was EXCEEDINGLY busy and distracted), rather than the bride actually clapping eyes on the kid herself. 'A skull necklace/dark makeup/'punk rock' boots' are all very vague... does she mean a big skull-sized hubcap or a discreet choker? I own discrete offbeat neckwear that would still be formal appropriate. What is 'dark makeup'? A few khol lines and cat eyes, or looking like a Lady Gaga backup dancer? Is OP of an age/cultural background where 'punk rock boots' is anything black and leathery, or are we talking real punk sh!t kickers here? And I REALLY, REALLY want to know why Dad is so mad if this outfit and action is as described. \n\nYou can as easily read this as a hyper-conservative mumsy wumsy freaking over her unloved, awkward phase littlest daughter not looking like a pretty princess and rushing off to assemble flying monkeys to help her clutch pearls while dad realizes it was not that big a deal and believes the two sisters got split for no good reason and the wife is a known pot stirrer whose soon-to-be-wed daughter just went with the ride for peace, or a concerned mom taking a bratty teen in hand to save the sister's day(so why is dad not mad? This bothers me most. Most dad's aren't really down with 'underwear showing' on their teen daughters and tend to be a bit less forgiving of the wild sort of outfit-as-described, though all men are different, of course)\n\nI'm a stickler for formal dress meaning formal dress. And the slit bit is unforgivable- not because of height, actually, but because messy cut raw edges on a formal gown is just NO, though it's also a mistake I can see an awkward teen making in an attempt to feel grown. On those two I'm firmly in the N T A camp. \n\nBut the rest is very subjective and 'my Ashley' sliding in at the end really worries me, alongside Dad being so much in the other camp. I'm really struggling to see OP as a reliable narrator, and not someone unhappy with an awkward ugly duckling teen not liking girly things (against a precious, normal older sister she favors). I find it frighteningly easy to see her over-exagerating a bunch of (no doubt ugly, and likely leaning to inappropriate, but this is a youngish teen and we were all awkward then) small additions that MAY have been forgivable to Ashley being vetoed by a conservative mom making too much of not a lot.\n\nLong story short, I REALLY wish the bride had any real input into the telling. Or had even been able to see the dang getup to make her decision for secondhand reporting. Something from someone who wasn't a mom who seems to have 0 liking and a lot of scorn for her youngest, heavy bias to her oldest, and a fixed idea of the world. I'm just not convinced this was really all that bad and not just teen awkwardness and Ashley rolled for peace so she could get on with her dang wedding and not mediate yet another mother-daughter spat.\n\nThis could be anything from an awkward teen trying to personalize the dress badly (which many families would just eyeroll at and move on) to an utterly disgusting ruination of the dresscode that would have flashed the kids butt at everyone.

The groom attires himself as a groom. The groomsmen and bridesmaids are clothed in a certain way that indicates their role.  The officiant likely has some particular attire tied to his/her role. And the wedding guests should be in some sort of wedding attire.  \n\n\nThe bride and groom should be the center of attention, and anyone else who presents themself in a way to draw attention to themselves is a jackass. \n\n\nSay, for example, I am going to an emo-themed, nontraditional wedding. My pale pink Brooks Brothers cardigan and shell, pearl necklace, knee length skirt and kitten heel pumps aren't going to do. Because although I would be dressed in my usual manner and with some formality, I would stand out like a hooker in a convent, and that would be a jackass move. So I would wear a dark purple twin set, a black skirt and my most interesting black shoes or boots. Not fully emo, but not standing out either.

Finally, I'm not making the argument that it's a chore I'm making the argument that if you are unwilling to put your happiness aside for someone else's in certain situations, like their wedding, you're a bad person that does not care about other people or their happiness. The younger sister also cares more about her aesthetic than her family. I don't understand how you don't see how every complaint you have against the older sister fits the younger sister one to one.

I understand the sentiment but sucking it up is rarely the best option and this situation is no different.", "EXACTLY people saying op forced her not to go, no, she chose not to after getting multiple chances to", "According to the post she did do basically that but the daughter was completely intransigent.", "I think she probably typed \u2018my daughter\u2019 then realised it would be confusing.", "Agreed, huge opportunity for relationship growth was missed.", "Always remember the average age of Reddit users and how their frontal lobes aren\u2019t quite developed. Of course many will side with the goth chick.", "To be fair, it does sound like that is exactly what her younger daughter did. The daughter could've gone with a big poofy black dress, a pair of buffalo platforms and full on Chris Motionless. \"Dark makeup\" (Which is probably just a smokey eye and possibly some lipstick), a formal dress with slit, skull jewelry and a pair of \"punk rock boots\" (Which I assume are something along the lines of a pair of Demonia cult combats, probs the riot 18BK) sounds tame enough when you weigh in the bias of the post. The only thing OP should've asked her daughter to change is probably the jewelry. Either the earrings or the necklace. Work with her instead of against her, she's only 15.\n\nWhen my godson was baptised, I wore a black blazer, a black shirt with a chunky necklace (I think it has a skull in the middle) in the collar, black dress pants and a pair of lower black \"dressy\" platforms. I had a black smokey eye makeup and short white hair at the time. Despite being the only person in all black, I didn't look out of place, upset or shock anyone since that's just the way I dress. My brother and his wife knew that when they asked me to be my nephews godmother and invited me to come. My brother even complimented my outfit at the time. I think I was 17 at the time.\n\nIf you invite someone to a function, it's usually because you want them there. The bride knew about her sisters style when she invited her. Nowhere in the post did OP indicate that the bride asked her sister to tone down her style during the wedding. No one is going to give a flying fuck about the other guests during the ceremony. If the sister was a part of the wedding party, which I have to assume she wasn't, I could see this being a problem as the party usually wear similar clothes, hair and makeup. If she's a normal guest, her accessories and makeup isn't going to \"steal the attention from the bride\" as some people in this thread are saying.\n\nYTA op.\n\nEdit: I'm just gonna throw in that op did state that the outfit \"was still technically in the dresscode.\" That's why I assume her daughters full outfit was tame enough.", "*Thank you for saying this.* I hate that some people in this comment section seem to think that all goth expression is over-the-top like this person's. I and people I know would generally say I have more of a goth aesthetic, but no I do not walk around with a necklace the size of a license plate around my neck, and *definitely* not to a formal event.\n\nWhenever I had a family gathering or formal event, I would at least somewhat limit my clothing choices out of respect for the event's hosts. Maybe not wear my larger rings or pick a jacket other than the one with metal band logos sewn into it. I found it kind of fun to try to balance the two looks.\n\nI truly think the problems with the look Alex chose were the large jewelry and the dress slit. I think a bit of dark makeup can really go with a dark sage dress, and a long dress with dark boots seems like a pretty good look (unless it's the type of punk boot with silver accessories and accents, then it might clash). But that dress slit... that is just not it. If they allowed it, maybe a smaller one at the bottom but jeez, a giant slit in a formal dress is just excessive...", "Yes this ^ disagree with the comments saying she shouldn\u2019t express herself but there\u2019s a way to do it while still being respectful of the event and dress code of the people getting married", "Please see my edit.

I\u2019m sure I could have found a middle ground if I wanted to. I recall changing back to my nornal clothes after the main part of the wedding, and that was completely fine.\n\nI\u2019m sure that if I had asked, I would have been allowed to wear something that isn\u2019t a dress but equally formal. But I WANTED to wear a dress for them. I know they would have loved to see me in a dress with my hair done, but I also knew they wouldn\u2019t force me to do it. So I guess knowing that, made me want to do it?", "Same! Especially because the girl picked the dress herself! NTA", "She wasn't a bridesmaid, where fair enough the bride has the say - she was just a guest. It sounded like a great outfit, just a bit edgy.", "I clocked the \"they don't get along and it's due to the age difference\" thing too.

I have long purple plaits, extensive tattoos on my arm and leg, and a plug in one ear. I still dress as closely to the dress code as possible. It\u2019s possible to choose outfits that don\u2019t stand out on their own as alternative but still coordinate with my personal style. She had months and decided last minute to get by the rules. Weddings aren\u2019t about my personal style. They are about the couple getting married. Showing up like that is as weird as wearing a white dress.", "Yes, exactly this. It sounds like the mother is a major factor is the daughters' rocky relationship. Ashley was probably just trying to keep the peace with mom by agreeing. Alex probably has an unmet emotional need when it comes to her mother because she is not \"my Ashley.\"", ">The \u201cmy Ashley\u201d really got me too. \n\nI think y'all are reading too much into what seems to just be an error. Sometimes she refers to her daughters as \"my daughter\" in the story, and sometimes she refers to them by the given names.\n\nI suspect she typed, or intended to type, \"my daughter\" and then realised it might be confusing and went to change it to \"Ashley\" but accidentally left \"my.\"", "I'm not sure the bride really got much of a say here. Mom informed her of her decision, but I suspect Mom would have been a huge problem if bride had contradicted her.", "That was the impression I got, although I can\u2019t imagine it escalating to the point it did without him laying eyes on her at some point. Perhaps if he was already at the venue\u2026", "Don\u2019t like this comment. I agree that for a wedding to someone close to you, you should try and fut the dresscode.\n\nBut you have no idea how hard it can be for someone to wear a dress. And sometimes it can in fact lead to a breakdown. And sure, that might be a \u201dyou\u201d problem. But its not something a person can just \u201dget over themselves\u201d. I think that if a woman really cant stand wearing a dress, they should be allowed to wear something else that is equally as formal. The only reason why I chose to wear a dress and not something else, was because I wanted to do it for my parents. Not because I was forced to.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t a possibility for everyone.

A \"Manchester City Shirt\" -- am I wrong in assuming that's what Americans would call a sports jersey?", "At a *formal* wedding? I\u2019ve been to weddings where docs would be 100% fine but this does not sound like one of them. There are plenty of flat shoes/boots that provide support but are still appropriate for formal weddings.\n\nI looked up the Demonias and those are completely inappropriate for a *formal* wedding dress code unless the bride and groom are deep into some alt subculture and you\u2019re dealing with a completely different rule set anyway.", "Well, in the case of the post I shared, the mom had time to talk to her daughter and figure things out.

I just find this interesting.", "Yep I wore them to a formal wedding. It was either those or I wasn't wearing a shoe on one foot and having a moon boot ( bride was extremely against the moon boot ) the groom couldn't careless about what footwear I had on.

She could've still worn cool jewelry, dark eyeliner, a dark colored lipstick that isn't jet black, had a clutch or something more to her tastes.\n\nSince COVID, we don't do business casual at work anymore, but I wear funky t-shirts all the time (wore them even when we did do business casual, but wore chinos versus jeans), and wear a solid colored hoodie or cardigan over them if I'm in a situation where I have to talk to the public.  I have fun barrettes or earrings.  There are ways!", "The lack of time is another way that this OP differs from the OP in the other post.
