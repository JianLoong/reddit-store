Alex was suppose to wear the dress she got which was sage green. Alex normally wears emo clothes at the moment, which is fine. Well she came down in the green dress and put a large slit in it that does up to her thigh. She also added a skull necklace, earnings, punk rock boots and really dark makeup. I told her to take that jewelry off quickly and give me the dress so I could fit the slit or at least make it shorter.\n\nAlex got mad and said it was fine and was in the dresscode. I told her no and that you will stand out. She refused again and i told her if she won't fix it then she can stay home. She refused again and she missed the wedding. Ashley understood why her sister wasn't here, but my husband was furious with me and called me a jerk. Alex is still not talking to me also\n\n \n\nEdit: Comments peoples said were relevant\n\nI got there really early before the wedding and brought the issue up in person, Ashley was still getting ready, that's when we had the conversation. She agreed it would be best.\n\nI also text my daughter that if she changes the outfit I could pick her up in time for the wedding, no response.\n\nI am fine with her expressing herself, she picked out the dress and she told me what she was gonna do for her makeup.\n\nThen the day of the wedding she did all of this. The slit was so high I could see her underwear is she walked fast, not to mention the jewelry was huge. i just don't get why she would do that, it was inappropriate to dress like that for the event, there is a time and place.\n\nNot to mention my Ashley was fine with Alex missing the wedding, she didn't want her there looking like that either", "created_utc": 1674325467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hxt5l/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_go_to_her/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her youngest daughter was attention seeking.", "NTA, it was attention seeking (even if that is her style) a wedding/formal event is not a time and place to express yourself. You were looking out for the bride/your daughter.", "NTA. This is no different than trying to bring a child to a child-free wedding. A rule is a rule, and she was expected to follow formal attire. She didn\u2019t, so she can sit this one out.\n\nYou mentioned you\u2019re fine with Alex expressing herself any other time. This definitely makes you NTA.

You said that both her outfit and makeup were discussed prior and deemed acceptable. Then on the day of she modified her makeup and outfit to extremes.( I mean a slit so high you can see her underwear?) JFC that's attention seeking if not downright malicious.

Get her to admit that and you're golden.", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here but 1). A slit showing underwear is too high for a 15 year old.\n2). Dress codes exist. If she went to private school she\u2019d have to adhere to one. If she gets a job she has to adhere to one. If she wants to go to high end restaurants or parties she has to adhere to them. It\u2019s not repressing individuality for crying out loud. It\u2019s living in society. If you don\u2019t want to adhere then you don\u2019t go. She chose not to. That\u2019s fine.

I live in combat boots and will wear them with formal dresses.  I'm 36 with two teen boys of my own.  One is an emo dresser one is not.  For things like family pictures and even church I let them dress how they want because I want them to be themselves like my parents allowed me. However,  for something like someone else's wedding,  no.  When I was 15 I was at the height of my goth phase,  and even I would wear a pale blue or floral dress for weddings.  Because the wedding wasn't about me.  Same with my kids,  for formal events,  it's not about them.  Sure my oldest will still wear a chain or something \"edgy\" but within reason. You have to learn when it's appropriate and her sisters wedding was not the place for flashing her panties.  The makeup and jewelry I probably would have been OK with,  but her modifying what I'm presuming was an expensive dress is a big no.  She has to learn it's OK to be yourself,  but sometimes you put your own preferences away for a day for people you love.", "NTA but why the \u201cmy Ashley\u201d in the edit?", "NTA - she didn't want her sister to have all of the attention that's why she did it. You shut that down and she's pissed. Too bad, she will get over it.

It was important to Ashley so it makes sense. \n\nBut this is one of those, \u201cSeriously, why do you care?\u201d moments for me. Ten years from now, you\u2019ll be more charmed and amused by Alex\u2019s clumsy youthful attempts at rebellion than whatever now-pathetically-dated clothes you planned to stick her in for the wedding.\n\nIf people stopped seeing their weddings as choreographed shows where everyone has to be in perfect costume, they\u2019d be happier and enjoy themselves more.", "Need more info...\n\nWhat would her sister have wanted you to do?

Definitely NTA for stopping her in making your other kid uncomfortable on her wedding though.", "NTA, there\u2019s no compromise when it comes to wedding attire and what the bride/groom approve of. Eldest daughter agreed it would be best for Alex to stay home. Which is perfectly reasonable because a massive slit up the side of a 15 year old girls dress, combat boots and heavy dark make up is distracting. You know your daughters and knew Ashley wouldn\u2019t approve of that attire. It was a tough decision but a wedding is a big event and Ashley deserves to have her wishes honored.

If this has been the wedding of a family friend, or a colleague, there would have been a dress code and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to attend based on her last minute alterations.

As someone who also dressed that way around that age , and as others have said already , a time and a place . It really sounds like she wanted to have the 'shock factor' and have attention on her because why should anyone else get attention? I'm not a prude and all for how people should dress, but a 15 year old doesn't need to be dressing revealingly . That shit is not okay , and if OP , if you were the one who bought the dress, daughter needs to do some extra chores or something to make up for ruining that dress.", "NTA. Her dress was approved as is, she didn\u2019t mention she was making extreme moderations. It was rude and I would\u2019ve left her too.", "NTA because the bride, Ashley was fully aware of the situation and was ok with uninviting her sister. Alex maybe a teenager but at 15 she can start to learn some social expectations for certain events and that actions have consequences. I can't find the link but this reminds me of a story where OP's sister or daughter did come dressed very risque as a guest for a wedding and then was upset years later that the big family wedding portrait was still displayed prominently because she was embarrassed about her look in the picture. OP refused to remove it because some of those family members were now deceased and she enjoyed the picture from that day as a whole.", "I see it's a bit of a mixed bag on this one.

Plans you were fine with. \nOnce the reveal was made, did you handle it correctly? Debatable. But it was the day of the wedding.\nAt the same time, Alex didn't consider Ashley in this and that's a real shame here.  \n\nYou and Alex need to communicate better.

When it's formal attire, you wear formal attire, including jewelry and alterations. When your office requires business casual, you wear business casual, not athletic-wear. If you're required to wear scrubs, you wear scrubs, not a cocktail dress. If you're going to a casual party, you don't wear a wedding dress.

If there is a dress code you follow the dress code or stay home.  Sometimes parents have to be a parent.

You were fine with her picking out what you and YOUR Ashley deemed appropriate attire. \n\nWhen she expressed herself in her full outfit you made it crystal clear you do not accept her for who she is, your love and acceptance is conditional on her confirming to you and YOUR ASSLEY. \n\nYou two asses got exactly what you wanted, your younger daughter out of the picture.

She didnt like the jewelry and I'm sure the bride heard only her description and not actually seen what her sister was wearing.", "You have to remember that the OP is only giving one biased side, and reading between the lines the way they talk scathingly about the daughter's tastes make me think it was unlikely as bad as they made out. The daughter even said it met the dress code. I'd be interested to see a picture, tbh,  to really be able to judge how bad it was.  I get the impression that it was more about what others might think than anything.", "Not at all.

Her dad showed up in ripped jeans, a shirt with holes amd stains on it, and clearly hadn't showered in at least a week. The judge was less than impressed by him, for a variety of reasons.
