Alex was suppose to wear the dress she got which was sage green. Alex normally wears emo clothes at the moment, which is fine. Well she came down in the green dress and put a large slit in it that does up to her thigh. She also added a skull necklace, earnings, punk rock boots and really dark makeup. I told her to take that jewelry off quickly and give me the dress so I could fit the slit or at least make it shorter.\n\nAlex got mad and said it was fine and was in the dresscode. I told her no and that you will stand out. She refused again and i told her if she won't fix it then she can stay home. She refused again and she missed the wedding. Ashley understood why her sister wasn't here, but my husband was furious with me and called me a jerk. Alex is still not talking to me also\n\n \n\nEdit: Comments peoples said were relevant\n\nI got there really early before the wedding and brought the issue up in person, Ashley was still getting ready, that's when we had the conversation. She agreed it would be best.\n\nI also text my daughter that if she changes the outfit I could pick her up in time for the wedding, no response.\n\nI am fine with her expressing herself, she picked out the dress and she told me what she was gonna do for her makeup.\n\nThen the day of the wedding she did all of this. The slit was so high I could see her underwear is she walked fast, not to mention the jewelry was huge. i just don't get why she would do that, it was inappropriate to dress like that for the event, there is a time and place.\n\nNot to mention my Ashley was fine with Alex missing the wedding, she didn't want her there looking like that either", "created_utc": 1674325467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hxt5l/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_go_to_her/", "score": 2407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her youngest daughter was attention seeking.", "NTA, it was attention seeking (even if that is her style) a wedding/formal event is not a time and place to express yourself.

You said that both her outfit and makeup were discussed prior and deemed acceptable.

Get her to admit that and you're golden.", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here but 1). A slit showing underwear is too high for a 15 year old.\n2). Dress codes exist. If she went to private school she\u2019d have to adhere to one. If she gets a job she has to adhere to one. If she wants to go to high end restaurants or parties she has to adhere to them. It\u2019s not repressing individuality for crying out loud. It\u2019s living in society. If you don\u2019t want to adhere then you don\u2019t go. She chose not to. That\u2019s fine.

I live in combat boots and will wear them with formal dresses.  I'm 36 with two teen boys of my own.  One is an emo dresser one is not.  For things like family pictures and even church I let them dress how they want because I want them to be themselves like my parents allowed me. However,  for something like someone else's wedding,  no.  When I was 15 I was at the height of my goth phase,  and even I would wear a pale blue or floral dress for weddings.  Because the wedding wasn't about me.  Same with my kids,  for formal events,  it's not about them.  Sure my oldest will still wear a chain or something \"edgy\" but within reason. You have to learn when it's appropriate and her sisters wedding was not the place for flashing her panties.  The makeup and jewelry I probably would have been OK with,  but her modifying what I'm presuming was an expensive dress is a big no.  She has to learn it's OK to be yourself,  but sometimes you put your own preferences away for a day for people you love.", "NTA but why the \u201cmy Ashley\u201d in the edit?", "NTA - she didn't want her sister to have all of the attention that's why she did it.

It was important to Ashley so it makes sense. \n\nBut this is one of those, \u201cSeriously, why do you care?\u201d moments for me.

Eldest daughter agreed it would be best for Alex to stay home. Which is perfectly reasonable because a massive slit up the side of a 15 year old girls dress, combat boots and heavy dark make up is distracting.

I'm not a prude and all for how people should dress, but a 15 year old doesn't need to be dressing revealingly . That shit is not okay , and if OP , if you were the one who bought the dress, daughter needs to do some extra chores or something to make up for ruining that dress.", "NTA.

It was rude and I would\u2019ve left her too.", "NTA because the bride, Ashley was fully aware of the situation and was ok with uninviting her sister. Alex maybe a teenager but at 15 she can start to learn some social expectations for certain events and that actions have consequences. I can't find the link but this reminds me of a story where OP's sister or daughter did come dressed very risque as a guest for a wedding and then was upset years later that the big family wedding portrait was still displayed prominently because she was embarrassed about her look in the picture. OP refused to remove it because some of those family members were now deceased and she enjoyed the picture from that day as a whole.", "I see it's a bit of a mixed bag on this one.

I mean, all AITA posts are one sided and biased by the very nature...but this one is a little too much so for me to really trust what's going on.\n\nOPs story wavers too much. The slit (the only thing I have a firm opinion on) went from 'thigh high' to 'showing undies' (these two do not correlate). She dances around 'my Ashley' very disingenuously. The bride's so called veto is very sus, because even OP just reports that she raced to the venue to tattle to the bride (at a point where she was EXCEEDINGLY busy and distracted), rather than the bride actually clapping eyes on the kid herself. 'A skull necklace/dark makeup/'punk rock' boots' are all very vague... does she mean a big skull-sized hubcap or a discreet choker? I own discrete offbeat neckwear that would still be formal appropriate. What is 'dark makeup'? A few khol lines and cat eyes, or looking like a Lady Gaga backup dancer? Is OP of an age/cultural background where 'punk rock boots' is anything black and leathery, or are we talking real punk sh!t kickers here? And I REALLY, REALLY want to know why Dad is so mad if this outfit and action is as described. \n\nYou can as easily read this as a hyper-conservative mumsy wumsy freaking over her unloved, awkward phase littlest daughter not looking like a pretty princess and rushing off to assemble flying monkeys to help her clutch pearls while dad realizes it was not that big a deal and believes the two sisters got split for no good reason and the wife is a known pot stirrer whose soon-to-be-wed daughter just went with the ride for peace, or a concerned mom taking a bratty teen in hand to save the sister's day(so why is dad not mad? This bothers me most. Most dad's aren't really down with 'underwear showing' on their teen daughters and tend to be a bit less forgiving of the wild sort of outfit-as-described, though all men are different, of course)\n\nI'm a stickler for formal dress meaning formal dress. And the slit bit is unforgivable- not because of height, actually, but because messy cut raw edges on a formal gown is just NO, though it's also a mistake I can see an awkward teen making in an attempt to feel grown. On those two I'm firmly in the N T A camp. \n\nBut the rest is very subjective and 'my Ashley' sliding in at the end really worries me, alongside Dad being so much in the other camp. I'm really struggling to see OP as a reliable narrator, and not someone unhappy with an awkward ugly duckling teen not liking girly things (against a precious, normal older sister she favors). I find it frighteningly easy to see her over-exagerating a bunch of (no doubt ugly, and likely leaning to inappropriate, but this is a youngish teen and we were all awkward then) small additions that MAY have been forgivable to Ashley being vetoed by a conservative mom making too much of not a lot.\n\nLong story short, I REALLY wish the bride had any real input into the telling. Or had even been able to see the dang getup to make her decision for secondhand reporting. Something from someone who wasn't a mom who seems to have 0 liking and a lot of scorn for her youngest, heavy bias to her oldest, and a fixed idea of the world. I'm just not convinced this was really all that bad and not just teen awkwardness and Ashley rolled for peace so she could get on with her dang wedding and not mediate yet another mother-daughter spat.\n\nThis could be anything from an awkward teen trying to personalize the dress badly (which many families would just eyeroll at and move on) to an utterly disgusting ruination of the dresscode that would have flashed the kids butt at everyone. And OP just ain't selling the latter well for me. I'm not even convinced Ashley 'agreed' as much as went 'whatever, not you two again, FFS let me get married in peace' and got on with her day.\n\nPity there was no fly on the wall here. I would love to know the real story.", "Agreed.  Insofar as attire is concerned, even a vaguely traditional wedding is a costume event. The bride attires herself as a bride. The groom attires himself as a groom. The groomsmen and bridesmaids are clothed in a certain way that indicates their role.  The officiant likely has some particular attire tied to his/her role. And the wedding guests should be in some sort of wedding attire.  \n\n\nThe bride and groom should be the center of attention, and anyone else who presents themself in a way to draw attention to themselves is a jackass. \n\n\nSay, for example, I am going to an emo-themed, nontraditional wedding. My pale pink Brooks Brothers cardigan and shell, pearl necklace, knee length skirt and kitten heel pumps aren't going to do.

Heck wear the dressy stuff and change later.", "Chunky black heels! I found cute ones at hot top before", "For me, it was that, plus the part where the bride was glad the sister didn't come looking like that. It's her wedding and she gets to make the rules, within reason. Lots of people have pointed out there are ways to do subtle emo/goth within a formal dress code. Sounds like this was not it.", "And there's plenty of goth like jewelry that would be more appropriate for the wedding. Some dark red jewel type earrings with a matching lacy black choker would have been more understated, matched the dress decently, fit her style, and been appropriate. It sounds like she put on the gaudiest stuff she had.. Or yes, she could have just sucked it up.", "There\u2019s no such thing as a reliable narrator on reddit.", "I got the feeling Dad didn't see the full  - not that it undermines your overall point, but it could be why he's not so wound up by the prospect of his daughter's underwear going on display as he might have been.", "Yes.. the whole \"my Ashley\" just come across as OP having a favorite and everyone knows. \nSit her in the back and move on.", "Other than the slit, yeah idk it sounds like this family kinda sucks. People wear boots, skulls & make up all the time & it can be very formal. Are we really saying that in 2023 that conservative fashion at a wedding or you\u2019re a monster? I know a goth girl who\u2019s really deep into fashion & she bartends & waitresses at a high end like $50 a plate restaurant where people dress up to go & she wears skull chokers & dark makeup with her black uniform & it\u2019s fine. No old people have heart attacks. \n\nAlso like the sister cares more about the aesthetics of a good conservative wedding than having her sister there? What a shitty sister.", "The \"My Ashley\" thing really stopped me in my tracks too. And after rereading it, the whole thing has a mommy takeover vibe to it. I am glad I'm not the only one who sensed this. Yes children need to learn when to dress appropriately, but this whole thing has a weird; Mom's way or the highway feel to it. I'm going to have an unpopular vote on this. But I think op iTA. And Alex is being a teen. And actually sounded like Alex had it worked out with her sister until op stuck her nose into it. Instead of letting Ashley decide whether or not it was actually inappropriate for her wedding, op did. Just based on that....OP, YTA", "Yes, all of this. The \u201cmy Ashley\u201d really got me too. I would also like to mention, my sister is 14 and I am 28 - we get on great. Which makes me question, if the mum is saying \u201cmy Ashley\u201d, does she have an awkward emo teen who feels like she\u2019s not as loved as her big sister? That could play a HUGE part in the sisters relationship between each other too. \n\nThis is irrelevant to the judgement tbf, but I agree there\u2019s too much conflicting/vague info to make a decent decision.", "Yeah, this is kind of where I come down as well. Assuming Alex's look was as dramatic/intense as described, it sounds like she did cross the line from \"staying true to her own tastes while still respecting the dress code\" into \"deliberately trying to hurt/annoy her sister on her wedding day.\" That's not cool, and cutting up an expensive formal dress isn't something I'd be thrilled about either. But making your daughter miss her sister's wedding is SUCH a huge consequence . . . I mean, this is hopefully a once in a lifetime event! Also, as a parent, in addition to it being an excessive punishment, it really doesn't seem effective. Alex gets the satisfaction of knowing she got a huge rise out of everyone (if that was in fact her goal), and gets to tell herself \"My mom made me miss my sister's wedding over a dress\" and totally convince herself she's the victim here, even if she actually was just being a brat (which I'm not fully convinced she was . . . tbh I think I'd have to see a picture to know if she really crossed the line between \"eccentric\" and \"inappropriate\"). I think in the mom's position, the most I would have said in the moment is \"That's really disrespectful to your sister and I'm very disappointed in you.  Now let's go.\" And then I would have ignored it entirely for the rest of the wedding and focused on having a good time and celebrating Ashley. I might have given Alex a consequence later, but I wouldn't have given her a single second of extra attention, even negative attention, on the wedding day itself. If she had bad intentions here, they almost certainly involved taking focus off Ashley and onto her, and her mom played right into that.", "I\u2019m with you on this. I told people to wear clothes for my wedding. I will absolutely side eye someone in jeans at the opera, but a 15 year old kid?

If you have a breakdown because you have to wear a dress for a single day then that\u2019s on you", "Right?! I\u2019m truly shocked and dismayed at the overwhelming response to this post. Like who fucking cares? She was clean and still in formal attire. Let the teenager be a teenager and move on. It\u2019s sad really.", "I know right? And I bet she's devastated, she's 15 for God's sake.\nAt least the husband is on Alex's side.\n\nI would be pissed at the tearing the dress part though, it could have gone to a seamstress and doing something like that behind everyone's back is not ok behavior.\n\nBut excluding her from the wedding is too much.", "Their post mentions they offered to try and reduce the height/length of the slit", "The sister was okay with her not going because it was a formal event. Kind of shitty thinking you can get away with altering your dress and look right before the wedding. \nShe couldn\u2019t give her sister this day?

She picked out the dress and told her earlier how she planned her make up originally so why did she side blind them?", "I was an emo kid way back when, still very goth/alt today. Even then as an alt teen you could not have payed me to wear a dress that showed my underwear to a family event. If I had to guess she doesn\u2019t even know what it is she\u2019s looking to do here. Is she looking for attention or is she just \u201csticking it to the man\u201d? Either way the only people around are close friends and family members so why would you try to dress so provocative?", "There's a difference between being lazy and being expressive.

The big things was that it was the OP's wedding and the OP's daughter. Attending your mother's wedding is different from attending your sister's wedding. Additionally a parent has different obligations towards their 12 year old child than a sibling does to a 15 year old sibling. \n\nThe comment wasn't advocating that everyone should just wear whatever they want to weddings.

This situation doesn't ring of any of those qualities. When a wedding becomes more about the clothes you wear than the celebration and time spent together, it seems a battle of ideals than an important life event.\n\nEdit: And if it adhered to the dress code, there wouldn't be any problems right? Looking bad while adhering to a dress code doesn't bar admission. It's petty.", "Actually she said the daughter said it was in the dress code.
