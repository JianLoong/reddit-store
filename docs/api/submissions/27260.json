I know we're all different but maybe she actually enjoys the attention. I'm basing this on Ops comment where she states bridesmaid is legit popping out of the dress with movement. Also aren't people usually all \"your wedding your rules\" and generally rude to people who don't want to appease the bride over small stuff. This isn't even that big of an ask she doesn't want someone else's tits out at her wedding.", "As a man I think you are absolutely TA for not letting that poor woman go as is! \ud83d\ude00", "YTA\n\nThere are two possibilities here. Either she is oblivious or doesn\u2019t care that her breasts are falling out of her dress, or you are greatly exaggerating the issue to try and make yourself look better\n\nIf it was the former then you wouldn\u2019t have needed to spend 3/4 of the post talking about how much bigger her breasts are then everyone else - or I\u2019m guessing she wouldn\u2019t have acted so hostile to your request\n\nSo I\u2019m going to go with the later and assume you were the AH here", "YTA", "NTA. Beyond it being your wedding and your choice, you and Grandma at the very least don't want Grandpa to see a wardrobe malfunction. In some churches, this could also be seen as sacrilegious and reflect poorly on you. Cindy should be a good enough friend to realize that the day ***should not be*** about her and her boobs! I would say, that the dress won't go over for ----- reasons, and tell her that she either needs the panel or doesn't stand up for you.", "YTA even though you\u2019re paying for it. Pick a different dress that you like on EVERYONE. my bridesmaids were dramatically different shapes and sizes and it took a while to find a dress everyone felt happy with and that I liked but it was worth it because they\u2019re my friends. No dress is worth making your friend feel singled out and like shit.", "As someone who is well endowed, being treated like this sucks.  It would\u2019ve been okay to ask if she minded having a modesty panel added, and if not\u2026choose another dress style.  By just telling her that you were altering her dress, you were rude and yeah, kinda body-shaming.  Women shaped like your friend and I have been catching shit about our bodies and dress codes since we got boobs - sometimes you even put on a frigging turtleneck and they complain about your boobs being \u201ctoo visible\u201d, and you either end up either wearing ill-fitting sacks (which is uncomfortable in addition to being embarrassing) or getting constantly prodded about the dress code.  YTA.", "YTA. Adding a panel to *one* dress is going to be so noticeably different that Cindy will stick out and it will be for all the wrong reasons. Either pick a more flattering dress for everyone or let each maid choose her own style in the color you love - you can even narrow it down to two or three styles for them to select from. Please don\u2019t die on this hill if you value this friendship.", "Yta if size 6 is too small and size 8 is too big, you get the 8 and have it tailored.\n\nIf there is *one* person with panels, its going to stand out.", "ESH\n\nIf the larger size covers her breasts, it could be taken in elsewhere.  If you want your bridesmaids in the same dress, you should have picked a dress that works for all your bridesmaids.  I could imagine that for her, it would suck to be singled out for something she has no control over.  I don't know that I'd go so far as to say she was right in that you were shaming her by not wanting a nip slip at your wedding, but I'm guessing she was taken aback by the suggestion that she be singled out for being well-endowed.  But it is your wedding, and you are paying for the dress; if you don't have an issue with one bridesmaid standing out, then she is taking it too far by threatening to back out.  A friend/bridesmaid should be there to support you on your day, and she is making this situation too much about her.", "YTA - Why did you choose a dress that doesn\u2019t fit her properly?\n\nBuy the bigger size and pay to have it altered. As is, you just sound like you have a problem with her boobs.", "Yta, next time, pick a dress that works for everyone. \n\n\nYou are wrong.

I get it's your wedding and you're paying for the dress, but the part that bothers me is \"I informed Cindy that we will add a panel to hers\".  Perhaps you should have had a discussion with Cindy and asked how she felt about adding a panel, not just informed her you were doing so.  If it were me, I wouldn't want my boobs popping out of a dress, especially at a wedding that I was in, but it was quite rude to just inform her this was what was happening.  Perhaps you should have continued looking at other dresses if this one didn't fit properly.  Or go up a size and have the baggy areas altered.  There had to be a better option then making her feel bad about part of her body she can't really control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't understand why so many people don't get that when it comes to weddings the overwhelming majority of attention should be focused on the bride and groom. \n\nThat's why you don't wear a white dress to a wedding, propose, announce a pregnancy etc, because you are taking away attention from the bride and groom. \n\nIf the dress doesn't fit well and is enhancing her natural characteristics to the point of indecency, it is reasonable to not want that in your wedding party for the obvious reason, it is taking attention away from the bride and groom, the whole reason of the day. \n\nI don't think you are unreasonable for asking for a modification, and if I was your friend I would do it because it's not that big of a deal to me, but it is to your friend so you have to decide what's more important. \n\nAs long as there is plenty of time to the wedding I would just work with the bridal party to find another dress that works for everybody. \n\nI know wedding planning is stressful and this was one thing you were hoping to have checked off your list but I don't think damaging a friendship is worth it because that's where this is heading if you both double down. \n\nI would just apologize over text and say you had a chance to think about it and you don't want her to feel body shamed so let's keep looking and find a dress that works for everyone and that everyone can feel beautiful in.", "YTA and a crap friend.", "YTA IMO. Why would you choose a dress that singles out one woman for something she can\u2019t control? What\u2019s wrong with a little boobage? She\u2019s gonna stick out like a sore thumb. Maybe choose a color and let\u2019s the bridesmaids choose from 3 dresses or something.", "YTA...You're punishing her for her body type, and the adjustment would be just as obvious as the different fit.  Unless her chest was actually full on falling out, she's under no obligation to adjust it. Would you tell the other ladies that they had to wear something to fill out the top of the dress better?  Likely not.", "YTA.  It's bizarre that the salesperson didn't offer to tailor the larger size to fit.  Not okay to just alter one dress.", "YTA. You picked a dress knowing how it fit her, then proceeded to be upset about how it fit her, which you already knew. Why did you pick that dress then?\n\nI get the logistical issue of not wanting her to have a wardrobe malfunction. But there are probably ways to alter it to fit her better without adding a panel. Or pick a different dress.", "YTA \n\nOne dress being different will be super obvious", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nIf you're hell-bent on everyone wearing the exact same dress, then either 1) everyone gets the extra panel; or 2) Cindy gets a larger size and you pay to have it altered where it's baggy.\n\nCindy's only an asshole because she's not even suggesting any compromise beyond \"I get to wear this regardless or I'm out.\"  \n\nThis is one of the reasons most brides these days ask for a **color** of dress, but allow their bridesmaids to choose something flattering and comfortable. They're not your matching set of dollies.", "NTA as a sane person with a larger chest who has dealt with similar things I say its your wedding and you don't want her dressing like that. Period point blank. You can talk to her again but I would not back down from it and Honestly I would be grateful for the panel that sounds weird but would probably look fine if professionals are doing it.  If she's going to prioritize her boobs on your wedding day she shouldn't be a bridesmaid anyway.", "YTA. It sounds like the dress wasn't sized right for her. Women with larger breasts often need to get a size up and then have the rest of the dress tailored down to fit. If the dress fits well, her boobs will be supported and the dress will be flattering on everyone. Adding a panel will look awful and she'll look different from everyone else.\n\nSounds like you tried a size up and when the rest of the dress was too baggy, you gave up. That's silly and I'm surprised the salesperson didn't suggest tailoring.", "NTA\n\nLet her drop out of the wedding. Find someone who understands this isnt a strip joint, its a G rated wedding with family and friends and probably kids.", "YTA, if it was one you all liked, then it should be fine as-is.

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a dress out there that\u2019s very similar to the original dress and won\u2019t look too different from what the other bridesmaids are wearing.", "NTA. You are paying for the dress and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable not to want your bridesmaid to wear a very revealing dress. But if you add a panel, her dress will look very different from the rest. This is why I\u2019m a fan of different style dresses in the same color for bridesmaids- everyone can wear something flattering to their body type.", "YTA. makes sure the dresses work for everyone. Also you can get a bigger size for her and have it fitted to taken in so it does look baggy.", "YTA. If a dress wasn\u2019t a good fit for ALL your bridesmaids, you should have gone with a different style. Singling her out and making hers the only dress that\u2019s different is not OK.", "Uhhh.\n\nYTA.\n\nSeriously? Shaming someone for \"size\"?

The second you saw the dress wouldn't work for her you should have chosen a different dress that worked for everyone.", "NTA I would want to see her bits popping out but almost Y T A for not allowing compromise", "YTA. my sister has a bigger chest and things definitely fit differently on her. She\u2019s found that adding panels totally changes the fit on the dress and makes it look worse. \n\nIt would be one thing if your BM wanted the panel but it\u2019s clear she doesn\u2019t. You don\u2019t get to be the boob police. I know it\u2019s your wedding but the whole \u201cit\u2019s my day\u201d ends where you\u2019re policing bodies in a dress you chose knowing it would accentuate the ample bosom of your friend.", "YTA, it sounds like going in you and the other bridesmaids knew it would work for everyone else, but not for the other one. This person is standing beside you, but that doesn't give you the right to shame her body. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the employee didn't mention tailoring that make the dress fit better for her means they just want more money from you and you can't see that.", "Preach. I\u2019m small-ish and busty and have been since I was a teenager. Your comment is right on the money and OP needs to get over it.\n\nWhat happens if someone else in the wedding party gains weight and it mostly ends up in their chest? Or if they get pregnant and don\u2019t have a bump, but the hormones make their chest swell? Is there a band-to-cup ratio cut off requirement for the \u201cmodesty panel\u201d or is it just at the bride\u2019s whims? Stop trying to control everything and focus on what actually matters: marrying someone and starting the next chapter of your life with them", "u/Alloddscanteven..I did that for my bridesmaid dresses. I picked the color and the bottom part/skirt was the same for everyone. But each woman picked the top she was most comfortable in. Everyone's happy, especially since each woman paid for her own dress.", "It\u2019s actually not her choice. If OP prefers a more modest look for her bridesmaids, she\u2019s allowed to insist on that.

Unless your bridesmaids are all fairly similar in shape, this really isn't feasible.", "Love that idea!", "If OP preferred modesty, she wouldn't have invited her balloon boobed friend who will steal attention on her special day because that's the real reason she wants to censor her", "Do the advice of sizing up and then getting the rest tailored tighter", "Oh OK. In that case, probably NTA in this occasion. You now have two scenarios. If you put the panel on, she will not like it and maybe not go ahead with the whole thing, or if you let it be and let gravity do its thing. Up to you on how to proceed dear OP!", "Then pick a different dress that works for everyone. Or you set the color and let all of the bridesmaids choose a style that works best for them.

The way it's written makes it sound like you want her to cover up because it's \"immodest\", not because it's impractical.", "You should add that to the post.
