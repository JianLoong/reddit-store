I don't know that I'd go so far as to say she was right in that you were shaming her by not wanting a nip slip at your wedding, but I'm guessing she was taken aback by the suggestion that she be singled out for being well-endowed.  But it is your wedding, and you are paying for the dress; if you don't have an issue with one bridesmaid standing out, then she is taking it too far by threatening to back out.

If it were me, I wouldn't want my boobs popping out of a dress, especially at a wedding that I was in, but it was quite rude to just inform her this was what was happening.

As long as the bride is paying and nothing else is wrong with the dress I don't see a big problem.

It was a button up that I buttoned to the button above my nipples (leaving the top most button and the one underneath unbuttoned) the camisole came up pretty high.  A coworker complained that when I was bent in a weird position, trying to grab a dropped box cutter from behind a shelf that they could see down my shirt. Mind you, they didn't see nipple, just cleavage. I was told I had to go up a shirt size and button EVERY button, including the one at my throat.  No one else was required to do this.\n\nSecond time: Boss told me a dress shirt I was wearing was inappropriate because you could see cleavage. You could see the top of my breasts, less than 2 fingers length. Kicker was that while yelling at me, she was wearing a much lower cut shirt. She just happened to be an A cup. \n\nLike I'm sorry that you can see that I have boobs. I'm not, however, going to be shamed for the fact that I have a large chest. My professional clothing options are pretty limited as is if I don't want to look sloppy (which wearing shirts that are too large in the tummy so they cover my chest often times does.) It doesn't help that both jobs I spent at least 75% of my time outdoors walking around. I'm not wearing a turtle neck in the summer because you can't accept that women have breasts and some happen to be larger than others.  I didn't choose to have a big chest,  I just do!
