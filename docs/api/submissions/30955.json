You're right that she was being rude by interfering in your relationship.\n* You are certainly not being \"closed-minded\" and it is very rude for her mother to accuse you of this.\n* She also called you uglier than the other guy! So rude.\n* And she's trying to use the other guy's looks as an excuse for her daughter's cheating!\n\nSo that's zero asshole behaviors from you, and four asshole behaviors from the mother. She's delusional and so are your parents for defending her.", "NTA. Your response to her mom doesn't sound rude at all. Her mom sounds a total asshole though (\"unfair\" to expect not to be cheated on with good-looking guys? wut?). Your parents are probably just worried this will affect their relationship, but that is not your problem.", "Yes, you absolutely did have to be so rude. \n\n>She said I was being unfair since the other guy was really good-looking,\n\nWhat the fuck kind of an argument is that? You really weren't rude enough.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy are grown adults messing and interfering with your relationships with people?  \nFor the sake of \"having a perfect little love story\" ??? That crashed and burned the second your ex decided to cheat because \"a guy was extremely good looking\", what's next, she cheats again because \"a guy had more money\" or \"a guy was better in bed\" and everyone around you are enablers. No wonder she cheated, she's got all of this approval and for what?   \n\n\n\"The other guy was really good-looking\" What the heck?! This legitimately means NOTHING! She cheated, she will cheat again, and it looks like your parents, her parents and her parents' friends are all on board with it, I bet you they'd help her hide her future affairs with other men later down the line.   \n\n\nHold your ground OP, do not let this sly and scheming brat back into your life, no matter who else she manipulates against you.", "NTA. Anna is the AH, and she got it from her momma.", "You\u2019re 18, go to uni and live your best life. Nta. Just because they\u2019re friends doesn\u2019t mean you owe it to them to get back together with her if you don\u2019t want to. And no is a complete sentence.", "NTA. Who does she think she is to tell you who you shoud be dating?", "Nta and I'm laughing at your Voldemort comment.", "NTA.  Tell Anna's mom that her daughter decided that the grass was greener on the other side, and it's her fault for discovering it was full of poison ivy.  And unlike stores, you don't take returns of soiled items.", "NTA.  All the parents in this story are delusional AHs though.", "NTA. Its good when people let you know who they really are. Your ex is a lying cheater who doesn\u2019t seem to have any remorse, \u201cpressing you\u201d as though you\u2019re being unreasonable by not welcoming her back. She is not relationship material. \n\nHer mom is as bad for thinking that it\u2019s fine for her daughter to cheat, without even a fig leaf of being able to say you\u2019re at fault in some way - she wouldn\u2019t want you to take Anna back if she didn\u2019t think you were a good boyfriend.\n\nThere were far worse things you could have said to them both that would still have been fair comments.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like the only sensible one in the group.", "E S H, except you OP, NTA.\n\nEverybody sucks here, from your parents wanting to make you be back with your ex even if they know what she did to you, from her expecting to be back with her after it didnt turn out with the guy she cheated you with, and even her mom who said she should understand the situation because he was \"really good-looking\", really?\n\nTalk to your parents, explain the situation and how they need to support you, not put you in a place you hate being; also, you were nice to you ex and her mom, because honestly, I would had been a lot worst, so if they try to come back, then show them that bad side, as they dont deserve no kindness as they are worst that Voldemort and his squad of Death Eaters.", "NTA sounds like no one is taking ownership for their actions.
