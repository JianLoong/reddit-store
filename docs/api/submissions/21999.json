Kudos to you and your ex wife, and good job setting parenting boundaries with your new wife. Color me impressed.", "NTA. Your ex *is* \"more important\". Those are her kids. They don't stop being her kids and become your wife's kids as soon as they enter your wife's house. I don't understand your wife on this matter.\n\nDoes she need to discipline your kids because your kids disrespect her or disobey the rules of her house - but you won't let her?", "NTA.  Your current wife should be aiming for being a friendly sort of person in the kids life, not a disciplinarian.  A step parent disciplining a kid rarely goes well.  She should instead aim for being more like a fun and encouraging adult in their lives.", "I have no real experience in this arena, as my parents are still married. But my gut instinct says NTA. That said, I personally feel that your wife should be allowed some right to discipline the kids, at least in your/her home.", "NTA. Sounds like you two are doing great. Lots of bio parents prefer the stepparents not to discipline, and your wife is acting insecure and immature about what happened", "NTA.  You're supporting your ex's right to discipline your kids with her, regardless of the location.  Kid (and unfortunately current wife) are trying to make it about the location they happen to be in.  That would NOT be healthy for the kids.\n\nYou might try something like \"her authority is over the kids, but not over the house.\"  But she might still be upset anyway.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t disrespect your wife in any way, you carried out a disciplinary action that the mother of that child established and your wife has no say in that decision, she married you to be YOUR partner, not to take over as mother of your kids. Although everyday rules and chores and boundaries are fair, discipline is left up to you and ex wife.", "NTA in any way. Children are not jointly owned community property. Your wife needs to stay out of the discipline.", "NTA. And kudos to you and your ex on excellent coparenting skills \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "NTA \n\nThese are not your wife\u2019s kids and she needs to except that. Good job co-parenting your kids", "INFO: Did you tell your wife she wouldn\u2019t have any authority over your kids (which she lives with and otherwise parents) before you got married? Are you ever planning on letting your wife discipline your kids? \n\nShe isn\u2019t their bio parent, but she did join your family by becoming your wife. I feel like most people would expect to have SOME authority over parenting the kids of the guy they marry (although she does have to involve both parent, of course). If the kids do misbehave (refuse to do communal chores, hit/seriously insult each other), without you there what DO you expect your wife to do?", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely brilliant parenting! You just showed your son, that he can't play his parents against each other. He learned a valuable lesson, that the consequences of his actions follow him regardless of who's house he's at. \n\nYou however need to sit down with your wife, she is thinking that her role in your kids' lives is more important than their mother's. You need to get on the same page with her, because this is not a healthy set up, your wife and you got to get this situation sorted through.", "NTA. Absolutely your ex is more important in regards to her children vs your now wife. Your wife doesn\u2019t get to veto your child\u2019s actual mother", "NTA", "NTA and the age of the children is important here \u2014- you backed up your the person you are co-parenting with. Your current wife needs to settle into the role she has\u2014also I am a step parent of two boys\u20144/6 then and 17/19 now.  I ALWAYS defer to bio parents\u2014 doesn\u2019t matter whose house I am in. Your teenage son tried  to get all alpha on his mother and you backed her up. I really don\u2019t see the problem with this.", "YTA.  Not for letting your ex punish your child. That is a no-brainer. But for telling your wife, she has zero ability to discipline the kids. You're creating a precedent where the kids can run all over their step mom, and she has to sit there and take it. I guess if you were up front about it before the marriage and she agreed, fine. But I'd be out in that scenario.", "YTA - NOT for letting your ex punish your son in home, that\u2019s completely fair. But I do think your wife should get an input on how the kids are raised. All of them, esp 5M, are still learning and young. In formative years, If your wife and you are gonna be together for a long time, having the ability to have some input is important for her to gain their respect. It doesn\u2019t have to be free for all, but allowing her to consult you about behavior/punishment is completely fine. It can start gradually, with continued conversation. Saying \u201cthat wasn\u2019t appropriate, I\u2019m gonna be talking to your dad later about punishment\u201d is completely acceptable, IMO", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife was out of line, but that is not a sustainable set up at all that your wife can't discipline your kids at all if they act up, etc.", "YTA, I think it's very odd that you don't want your wife to have any role at all in your kids' lives, but it is your right as a parent. I do understand why your wife is upset; I hope she agreed to the \"you have no role in my kids' lives\" boundary with her before you got married otherwise, she probably won't stay long. For example, if you're away and one of the kids acts up, they get away with it with no consequences until you get back? That's not healthy for anyone.", "YTA. Your wife should have a say in how the children are disciplined, you're a family now. Or is she just supposed to basically live apart from the children and just warm your bed at night and cook your meals while your *ex* has more say in your house than she does? I have a feeling you won't be married too long. No woman likes to feel she comes in second to another.", "NTA, but I think you really need to sit down with your wife and hash out exactly what her role is, and check in with her emotionally. She is probably feeling like she doesn't have any say over what goes on in her house, which is not a good feeling. What exactly is the procedure for when the kids misbehave under her watch? Actually, let me back up. Is she expected to watch the kids alone or help with childcare? If she is, then together you need to come up with a system, much like you have with your ex. If they misbehave when she's watching them, what does she do, just say, wait until your dad gets home? I mean, that's kind of setting the kids up to just walk all over her, if there are no consequences. \n\nI understand where you're coming from as the parents being the ones to dole out discipline. I don't think your wife is trying to discipline the kids so much as she's trying to feel respected.", "NTA\n\nThis has nothing to do with your house, everyone telling you you're wrong is wrong and butting into business that isn't theirs.", "Respecting the ex's grounding yes, but the absolute \"no role in my kids' lives\" rule for his wife is not healthy; for example, if the OP is not home and one of the kids acts up badly, the wife has to just let the kid do whatever until he gets home. That's not very healthy at all.", "So, OP is not home, one of the kids is acting badly and knows his wife can do nothing about it; they can act any way they want, and she's supposed to let them. That's not fair or right and I suspect OP will be single again soon.", "She\u2019s not those kid\u2019s biological mother though therefore she has and will never have the right to punish those kids unless given permission or agreed upon to do so by their father. I don\u2019t think you understand how arrogant a step mother can get once she has power over those kids. The father isn\u2019t the asshole for anything imo, he\u2019s doing right my his children and raising them between their mothers and fathers rules. Also the father did let the mother punish the child!", "Especially with a five year old. I used to put mine in time out no matter where we were because if you wait, they don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s for. Not at that age. They\u2019re only starting to grasp the concept of delayed consequences.", "Family yes, but that doesn't mean the new spouse automatically becomes a third parent. His wife is an idiot if she leaves him over this.\n\nYes, I am a stepmother.", "He doesn\u2019t say that anywhere, though. He says that the only ones who can decide about discipline are himself and the ex wife. I\u2019m assuming for timeouts for the 5yr old this is not the case, but goes for things like grounding and having important discipline convos. This is typical for many blended families. \n\n\nThe \u201cno role in my kids lives\u201d (to quote you) isn\u2019t in his post. He says the new wife feels that he diminishes her authority by not letting her (new wife) play a \u201cmore important role\u201d in the kids\u2019 lives. She\u2019s equating being allowed to discipline the kids with playing an important role in their lives, and clearly feels some kind of way about the fact that their mother is allowed to discipline them and she is not.", "I think a step parent should discipline along the lines of an aunt or an uncle - in your scenario try to reason with them, have relationship with them.  If an aunt or an uncle has charge of a kid, they try to connect with them.  This stepmom just seemed a little too focused on discipline and not enough on connection.  In my experience kids tend to really resent stepparents who try to be too much of a disciplinarian, it's much better coming from the parent.", "Exactly. With that level of restriction on what she can do, I imagine the wife does not feel like it's her home, really. A healthy set of boundaries regarding discipline would be much better for all, including the kids.", "What about when the OP is not present? The kids act up and know they don't have to listen to her because she has no role in their lives. That's what the OP said, she can't ground or discipline them in any way. Not healthy at all. Setting boundaries on what she could do, yes that would be reasonable.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have no input though. If the kid is completely in the wrong, is she supposed to be like okay :) and move on? Why can\u2019t they discuss discipline together as the kids are young. ESP the 5M has been in her life since he can remember.", "Did I say that? No I didn't. But she is basically the maid and can meet ALL their needs except she has no say in correcting them. Sure, that's fair. Two thumbs up!", "\"she has tried to discipline them, ground them, etc, I\u2019ve stopped her explaining she isn\u2019t a parent and the only ones who can decided those things about our kids\" He didn't set any limits on that so yes the kids could act crazy if he's not home and according to OP, his wife is supposed to just wait.", "Good points absolutely; but there's nothing to suggest the wife doesn't connect with them well, or not, just no evidence either way. The aunt/uncle analogy is a good one; correction or discipline within boundaries that they both agree on, including cases where the OP is not home to take care of it.", "OP needs a bangmaid, not a wife.", "Parents set the rules and discipline. Stepparents back them up. I'm sure OP's children know they'd be in trouble with him, and possibly their mother, if they disrespected their stepmother.\n\nIt is healthy to let the bio parents handle discipline. That doesn't mean that children have no respect for their stepmother or stepfather.", "The father would take care of it. Children are not property. Marrying someone with children does not make you the children's parent.", "Just a maid? Really? That's not how it works.", "Like\u2026yeah kind of. Plenty of parents have rules like this for new spouses, where step parents can discipline the way an aunt/uncle/trusted nanny would be allowed to discipline but they can\u2019t make big decisions or implement anything significant. If a kid threw a plate and broke it, they could make the kid clean up. If they kid hit them, they could put them in a timeout (or whatever the parents do), but then it\u2019s the step parents job to report to the bio parent what happened and the bio parent can escalate if they see fit.", "If she is putting up with his conditions, that's pretty much what he has already...", "Depends on the kids; I just think the OP went too far in basically telling his wife that she can't stop them from ripping up one of her dresses or flushing her jewelry down the toilet unless he says so. That's not normal. Setting boundaries on what she could do, yes of course.", "Well according to OP, if he is not around to approve it, she couldn't stop them from ripping her dresses up or flushing her jewelry down the toilet or anything else. She may not be just a maid, but she definitely can't feel that it is her home either.", "Three thumbs up!", "That type of boundary would be reasonable I agree; the dad didn't say anything like that though; a timeout is still discipline, just fairly mild.", "That's the most ridiculous thing I've read on AITA .Good night.", "\"she has tried to discipline them, ground them, etc, I\u2019ve stopped her explaining she isn\u2019t a parent and the only ones who can decided those things about our kids\" The example I gave is literally what the OP said he wanted. Maybe he didn't MEAN it that extreme, but we have to go by what he said.  Setting healthy boundaries on what she could do would be normal, as it is, he'll be single soon I suspect."]}
