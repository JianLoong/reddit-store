Your current wife should be aiming for being a friendly sort of person in the kids life, not a disciplinarian.  A step parent disciplining a kid rarely goes well.  She should instead aim for being more like a fun and encouraging adult in their lives.", "I have no real experience in this arena, as my parents are still married. But my gut instinct says NTA. That said, I personally feel that your wife should be allowed some right to discipline the kids, at least in your/her home.", "NTA. Sounds like you two are doing great. Lots of bio parents prefer the stepparents not to discipline, and your wife is acting insecure and immature about what happened", "NTA.  You're supporting your ex's right to discipline your kids with her, regardless of the location.  Kid (and unfortunately current wife) are trying to make it about the location they happen to be in.

He learned a valuable lesson, that the consequences of his actions follow him regardless of who's house he's at. \n\nYou however need to sit down with your wife, she is thinking that her role in your kids' lives is more important than their mother's. You need to get on the same page with her, because this is not a healthy set up, your wife and you got to get this situation sorted through.", "NTA.

You're creating a precedent where the kids can run all over their step mom, and she has to sit there and take it. I guess if you were up front about it before the marriage and she agreed, fine. But I'd be out in that scenario.", "YTA - NOT for letting your ex punish your son in home, that\u2019s completely fair. But I do think your wife should get an input on how the kids are raised. All of them, esp 5M, are still learning and young. In formative years, If your wife and you are gonna be together for a long time, having the ability to have some input is important for her to gain their respect. It doesn\u2019t have to be free for all, but allowing her to consult you about behavior/punishment is completely fine. It can start gradually, with continued conversation.

I do understand why your wife is upset; I hope she agreed to the \"you have no role in my kids' lives\" boundary with her before you got married otherwise, she probably won't stay long. For example, if you're away and one of the kids acts up, they get away with it with no consequences until you get back? That's not healthy for anyone.", "YTA. Your wife should have a say in how the children are disciplined, you're a family now. Or is she just supposed to basically live apart from the children and just warm your bed at night and cook your meals while your *ex* has more say in your house than she does? I have a feeling you won't be married too long. No woman likes to feel she comes in second to another.", "NTA, but I think you really need to sit down with your wife and hash out exactly what her role is, and check in with her emotionally. She is probably feeling like she doesn't have any say over what goes on in her house, which is not a good feeling. What exactly is the procedure for when the kids misbehave under her watch? Actually, let me back up. Is she expected to watch the kids alone or help with childcare? If she is, then together you need to come up with a system, much like you have with your ex. If they misbehave when she's watching them, what does she do, just say, wait until your dad gets home? I mean, that's kind of setting the kids up to just walk all over her, if there are no consequences. \n\nI understand where you're coming from as the parents being the ones to dole out discipline.

That's not very healthy at all.", "So, OP is not home, one of the kids is acting badly and knows his wife can do nothing about it; they can act any way they want, and she's supposed to let them. That's not fair or right and I suspect OP will be single again soon.", "She\u2019s not those kid\u2019s biological mother though therefore she has and will never have the right to punish those kids unless given permission or agreed upon to do so by their father. I don\u2019t think you understand how arrogant a step mother can get once she has power over those kids. The father isn\u2019t the asshole for anything imo, he\u2019s doing right my his children and raising them between their mothers and fathers rules. Also the father did let the mother punish the child!", "Especially with a five year old.

He says that the only ones who can decide about discipline are himself and the ex wife. I\u2019m assuming for timeouts for the 5yr old this is not the case, but goes for things like grounding and having important discipline convos. This is typical for many blended families. \n\n\nThe \u201cno role in my kids lives\u201d (to quote you) isn\u2019t in his post. He says the new wife feels that he diminishes her authority by not letting her (new wife) play a \u201cmore important role\u201d in the kids\u2019 lives. She\u2019s equating being allowed to discipline the kids with playing an important role in their lives, and clearly feels some kind of way about the fact that their mother is allowed to discipline them and she is not.", "I think a step parent should discipline along the lines of an aunt or an uncle - in your scenario try to reason with them, have relationship with them.  If an aunt or an uncle has charge of a kid, they try to connect with them.  This stepmom just seemed a little too focused on discipline and not enough on connection.  In my experience kids tend to really resent stepparents who try to be too much of a disciplinarian, it's much better coming from the parent.", "Exactly. With that level of restriction on what she can do, I imagine the wife does not feel like it's her home, really. A healthy set of boundaries regarding discipline would be much better for all, including the kids.", "What about when the OP is not present? The kids act up and know they don't have to listen to her because she has no role in their lives. That's what the OP said, she can't ground or discipline them in any way. Not healthy at all. Setting boundaries on what she could do, yes that would be reasonable.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have no input though. If the kid is completely in the wrong, is she supposed to be like okay :) and move on? Why can\u2019t they discuss discipline together as the kids are young.

Stepparents back them up.

Marrying someone with children does not make you the children's parent.", "Just a maid? Really? That's not how it works.", "Like\u2026yeah kind of. Plenty of parents have rules like this for new spouses, where step parents can discipline the way an aunt/uncle/trusted nanny would be allowed to discipline but they can\u2019t make big decisions or implement anything significant. If a kid threw a plate and broke it, they could make the kid clean up. If they kid hit them, they could put them in a timeout (or whatever the parents do), but then it\u2019s the step parents job to report to the bio parent what happened and the bio parent can escalate if they see fit.", "If she is putting up with his conditions, that's pretty much what he has already...", "Depends on the kids; I just think the OP went too far in basically telling his wife that she can't stop them from ripping up one of her dresses or flushing her jewelry down the toilet unless he says so. That's not normal. Setting boundaries on what she could do, yes of course.", "Well according to OP, if he is not around to approve it, she couldn't stop them from ripping her dresses up or flushing her jewelry down the toilet or anything else. She may not be just a maid, but she definitely can't feel that it is her home either.", "Three thumbs up!", "That type of boundary would be reasonable I agree; the dad didn't say anything like that though; a timeout is still discipline, just fairly mild.", "That's the most ridiculous thing I've read on AITA .Good night.", "\"she has tried to discipline them, ground them, etc, I\u2019ve stopped her explaining she isn\u2019t a parent and the only ones who can decided those things about our kids\" The example I gave is literally what the OP said he wanted.

Call dad.\u201d  So I called Dad and Dad immediately put a stop to it and said that when he\u2019s not home, I\u2019m in charge. \n\nI\u2019ve never punished the kids without his consent, and the most severe \u201cpunishment\u201d was dismissed from the dinner table & no snacks the remainder of the night. I would be floored and humiliated if my husband told me I had no right to discipline children that lived in my house when he wasn\u2019t there. \n\nAlso, OP YTA", "His children already have a mother, they don't need a second one. Pretty sure OP didn't promise her she was the new matriarch of his family", "It\u2019s not her place though?? NTA", "Of course she can stop them, like any person faced with opposition from bratty kids would. What she can't do is ground them in a parental sense. That is for the husband to do, after she informs him of what the kids had done. \n\nIt's like if a random kid tossed her purse into the trash at the park. Is she going to ground them, hit them, take away their phones, etc? Or is she going to berate them and tell their parents? that's what she needs to understand."]}
