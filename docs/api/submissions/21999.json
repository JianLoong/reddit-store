Your current wife should be aiming for being a friendly sort of person in the kids life, not a disciplinarian.  A step parent disciplining a kid rarely goes well.  She should instead aim for being more like a fun and encouraging adult in their lives.", "I have no real experience in this arena, as my parents are still married. But my gut instinct says NTA. That said, I personally feel that your wife should be allowed some right to discipline the kids, at least in your/her home.", "NTA. Sounds like you two are doing great. Lots of bio parents prefer the stepparents not to discipline, and your wife is acting insecure and immature about what happened", "NTA.  You're supporting your ex's right to discipline your kids with her, regardless of the location.  Kid (and unfortunately current wife) are trying to make it about the location they happen to be in.

You're creating a precedent where the kids can run all over their step mom, and she has to sit there and take it. I guess if you were up front about it before the marriage and she agreed, fine. But I'd be out in that scenario.", "YTA - NOT for letting your ex punish your son in home, that\u2019s completely fair. But I do think your wife should get an input on how the kids are raised. All of them, esp 5M, are still learning and young. In formative years, If your wife and you are gonna be together for a long time, having the ability to have some input is important for her to gain their respect. It doesn\u2019t have to be free for all, but allowing her to consult you about behavior/punishment is completely fine. It can start gradually, with continued conversation.

I do understand why your wife is upset; I hope she agreed to the \"you have no role in my kids' lives\" boundary with her before you got married otherwise, she probably won't stay long. For example, if you're away and one of the kids acts up, they get away with it with no consequences until you get back? That's not healthy for anyone.", "YTA. Your wife should have a say in how the children are disciplined, you're a family now. Or is she just supposed to basically live apart from the children and just warm your bed at night and cook your meals while your *ex* has more say in your house than she does? I have a feeling you won't be married too long.

Actually, let me back up. Is she expected to watch the kids alone or help with childcare? If she is, then together you need to come up with a system, much like you have with your ex. If they misbehave when she's watching them, what does she do, just say, wait until your dad gets home? I mean, that's kind of setting the kids up to just walk all over her, if there are no consequences. \n\nI understand where you're coming from as the parents being the ones to dole out discipline.

That's not very healthy at all.", "So, OP is not home, one of the kids is acting badly and knows his wife can do nothing about it; they can act any way they want, and she's supposed to let them.

If an aunt or an uncle has charge of a kid, they try to connect with them.  This stepmom just seemed a little too focused on discipline and not enough on connection.  In my experience kids tend to really resent stepparents who try to be too much of a disciplinarian, it's much better coming from the parent.", "Exactly.

If they kid hit them, they could put them in a timeout (or whatever the parents do), but then it\u2019s the step parents job to report to the bio parent what happened and the bio parent can escalate if they see fit.", "If she is putting up with his conditions, that's pretty much what he has already...", "Depends on the kids; I just think the OP went too far in basically telling his wife that she can't stop them from ripping up one of her dresses or flushing her jewelry down the toilet unless he says so.

But you're a dick to your wife where you DON'T present that front to the kids.  \n\nIf she has any responsibilities with your kids, then she needs a certain amount of power.  You want her to watch the kids while you go do something?  She needs to be able to institute first levels of discipline without you giving \"permission\".  In our house, that was time outs.  And, yeah, you've absolutely established that your wife comes dead last to the kids.  \n\nYou're setting your wife up to fail as a step-mother and to resent you as a \"partner\" because you are keeping her on the outside.", "YTA. Not for letting your ex punish your kid, but for not allowing your current wife to also punish.\n\nWhen you married again, did you really think that your now wife didn't take into account your three kids?

You need to let your wife also parent or you'll find yourself divorced yet again.", "NAH \n\nYou should have a more in depth conversation with your wife about the discipline issues.

Steps, fosters, adoption none of that matters because you aren't the parent and you can't take care of a kid who isn't yours biologically. The wife has no place helping any of those kids and should just spoil them!\"\n\nShe is raising the toddler part-time but I guess she should stop and let the father deal with everything since \"she's not a parent\". Doesn't matter if the teen comes home smelling of alcohol or weed, high five and move on. Truly the most mature response when the father isn't there. She isn't power-tripping, she wants to either be able to be an authority in CHILDREN'S lives or not have to do jackshit or take jackshit from those kids. You made this a habit and she hasn't been playing along, but the moment she does don't be surprised if she tells you she has no duty to do anything for them since \"she isn't a parent\" or even better a fully grown adult who has experienced life moreso than any of these kids \"isn't mature enough to know when something needs to change\". You are completely disregarding her as a person. This could however go swimmingly with her treating them like roommates and let them fend for themselves when you're not there. I don't see how stopping legitimate punishment is effective in teaching these kids anything. You are excellent at co-parenting but not independently.", "YTA, and I can\u2019t believe these responses.

Yes to successful co-parenting but a couple things stood out to me and before anyone freaks the fuck out, while these things may not bother you, they could be upsetting his current wife.\n\nHe still calls his ex wife by her nickname of \"Lizzy\".   We know her name is Elizabeth. He stated it. Halfway through when he gets to the part where his current wife is upset he starts calling her \"Lizzy\". Hmm. \n\nThey own a business together and presumably work together. This could be another thing that could make his wife a bit uncomfortable. \n\nHis \"new\" wife of two years gets no say in how the children in her home are parented? Not even a say at all? Teenagers are going to teenager but Dad should be setting an example of how he wants his wife treated by his children.

Your wife will continue to not be a decision making parent, though should be treated respectfully by the kids. NTA", "NTA and you and your ex wife are great co-parents.  Way to go.", "Eh, I'm going against the grain and saying both you and your wife suck and here's why. \n\nYour wife shouldn't be encouraging punishments for the kids to be dropped at your house and only maintained at the mom's house if the mom is the one saying they should happen. I don't know what the goal for that is. Maybe wanting to be seen as the fun stepparent or a dislike of the ex-wife, I don't know. I just know that if the punishment applies at one house for doing something wrong, it should be maintained at the other. How does the stepdad work? Does he respect your punishments for the kids? \n\nYou, on the other hand, have given your wife little to no authority in her own house. I get telling her that she shouldn't try disciplining the 16yo, he won't respect that, but what about the other two, your 12yo and 5yo? Heck, maybe discipling the 12yo won't work as well, but she can at least put the 5yo in time out or take away tv? They won't respect her and what if you and her have a child, that child won't respect her because it's older siblings won't and they'll learn from them like Monkey see, Monkey do. \n\nI've heard some arguments that she should just tell you when they misbehave and let you handle it. That's all well and good, but how is it enforced when you're not there? The one thing I do appreciate is that you don't disregard your ex-wife's parental role and you do back her up. I've seen a lot of reddit posts where the parents undo each other's punishments purely because they don't like the ex or they want to be the fun parent.

Like is she just supposed to just let 3 kids walk all over her and mess up her house? I don't quite get how not allowing your current wife to discipline your children works, especially in the case of the 5-year-old who she's apparently lived with since he was a 3-year-old.", "NTA. You and your ex should be on the same page as much as possible when it comes to the children you share. Backing her up with your temperamental teen was the right call.

All too often when parents are divorced, they try to win over their kids by wanting to be the \"fun\" one and by undermining the other parent's rules and consequences.  It's really refreshing to see people co-parenting who actually have each other's backs.  You weren't diminishing your wife's authority or encouraging your ex to act more important than her.  You were having a conversation with your CHILD and making it clear to him that just because he's in your house, it doesn't mean that his mother ceases to have any authority over him.   Especially when it comes to discipline, children need consistency from both parents.  Entitled brats are created when there's always someone willing to give them a way out of facing the consequences of their actions.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone else is nuts. Kids need to see a united front. And your ex-wife's word about your kids IS more important than your current wife. She gave birth to them!", "NTA - you're doing co-parenting correctly. You're not letting the kids manipulate you against each other in order for the kids to get away with stuff. When it comes to raising the kids, your ex wife IS more important. SHE is their mom and the kids will always see her as their mom. You two decided to part ways as spouses, but it's great that you're keeping up a united front as parents.\n\nI'll add that my parents also co-parented well after divorce, and it really helped make my brother and I feel loved/prioritized, and we both became very well-adjusted adults. The divorce was not traumatizing for us because we still had two very collaborative parents even if we had two houses to switch between.", "NTA for backing the ex to discipline your son. I do offer a warning however about your wife. You said she has no say in how to discipline because she's not their parent which is fair.

That's what solid marriages do. Coming to whine on AITA isn't the way to go. Go back to your wife and have the conversation.

You and your wife may enjoy reading this [paper](https://www.afta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Papernow-2018-Recoupling-in-Mid-Life-Beyond.pdf), which is written for family therapists, but offers some powerful, research-backed insights into stepfamily relationships. I read a book by the same author and it has helped my own remarriage go incredibly well. In short: couples who educate themselves on what\u2019s normal in stepfamily relationships tend to be more successful. Stepparents should focus on \u201cconnection before correction\u201d and seek to build trust with their stepchildren. Rather than trying to build trust as a whole-family group activity, one-on-one time between each pair of people is crucial. \n\nA couple of relevant passages for you:\n\n\u201cStepparents of all ages seem to want more limits and boundaries with their stepchil- dren. Parents want more care and understanding for their children (Papernow, 2013, 2015b). Stepparents see parents as \u201cwimpy.\u201d Parents see stepparents as \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d This division seems to hold across many cultures and in many cultures (Faroo, 2012; Papernow, 2015a; Tai, 2005; Webber, 2003). In later-age stepcouples, the differences often center on financial, physical, and emotional support of young adult and adult stepchildren. Parents want to help their adult children. Stepparents want stepchildren to \u201cbe independent.\u201d What is \u201cgood parenting\u201d to the parent may be seen as \u201cenabling\u201d to the stepparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn stepfamilies, the deep channels of intimate connection and the established, often unspoken, norms and rhythms of interaction lie in parent\u2013child relationships, not in the stepcouple or in stepparent\u2013stepchild relationships. Just as in younger stepfamilies, when parents are needed and engaged with their children, this often means that stepparents are left on the sidelines and sometimes even directly rejected by their stepchildren. Step- family structure consistently puts stepparents in a \u201cstuck outsider\u201d position, standing on the sidelines of family life; parents become \u201cstuck insiders,\u201d torn between the needs of the people they love (Papernow, 2013).\u201d\n\n\u201cLate-life stepcouples, even more than younger ones, are often upset and even outraged when an adult child wants time alone with Mom or Dad without his or her new partner. However, parent\u2013child relationships are forever. Parent\u2013child alone time honors this real- ity. Spending stepparent\u2013stepchild alone time is also important. In the presence of the parent\u2013child relationship, stepparent\u2013stepchild relationships take a back seat. Encourage stepparents to find easy bonding activities with their stepchildren.\u201d\n\n\u201cResearch primarily focuses on younger stepfamilies (for reviews, see Ganong & Cole- man, 2017; Papernow, 2013). However, in my experience, many of the findings apply in older stepfamilies as well: (1) Parents need to retain the limit-setting role. As in younger stepfamilies, until stepparents have forged close, trusting relationships with their stepchildren, stepparents have input, but parents have the final say about their own chil- dren and deliver the news; (2) Authoritarian (harsh/cold) parenting by stepparents is toxic to stepparent\u2013stepchild relationships; and (3) Successful stepparents concentrate on \u201ccon- nection, not correction\u201d (Papernow, 2013, p. 79). Stepparents can voice concerns and wishes to their stepchildren, but they need to do so in ways that build connection, with \u201cI\u201d messages and kindness, not \u201cyou\u201d messages and harshness. A helpful sentence stem is, \u201cI\u2019d love it if. . .\u201d (vs., \u201cYou never.. . .\u201d).\u201d", "This is where house rules should come into play. Set out consequences for behaviors. Then doesn\u2019t matter whose house the kids are at and isn\u2019t a matter of which parent/stepparent is there. Kids have a clear understanding of what happens for behaviors.

That doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t respected. That doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t care for each other and work together.

What it did mean is iF those things happened and I wasn\u2019t listening yeah, she would\u2019ve talked to my dad. His job would then be to come up with a plan or punishment to fit the issue.

If they set reasonable boundaries and rules that would be different, but we have to go by what OP said.", "Depends on the step-parent.

All this we allow schools and babysitters but not to stepparent who feed you, clean after you, give you medicine when you are sick, drive to school.

They need to have some agreed on rules or the wife will rightly get tired of being a doormat and leave.
