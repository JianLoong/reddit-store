Your current wife should be aiming for being a friendly sort of person in the kids life, not a disciplinarian.  A step parent disciplining a kid rarely goes well.  She should instead aim for being more like a fun and encouraging adult in their lives.", "I have no real experience in this arena, as my parents are still married. But my gut instinct says NTA. That said, I personally feel that your wife should be allowed some right to discipline the kids, at least in your/her home.", "NTA. Sounds like you two are doing great. Lots of bio parents prefer the stepparents not to discipline, and your wife is acting insecure and immature about what happened", "NTA.  You're supporting your ex's right to discipline your kids with her, regardless of the location.  Kid (and unfortunately current wife) are trying to make it about the location they happen to be in.

You're creating a precedent where the kids can run all over their step mom, and she has to sit there and take it. I guess if you were up front about it before the marriage and she agreed, fine. But I'd be out in that scenario.", "YTA - NOT for letting your ex punish your son in home, that\u2019s completely fair. But I do think your wife should get an input on how the kids are raised. All of them, esp 5M, are still learning and young. In formative years, If your wife and you are gonna be together for a long time, having the ability to have some input is important for her to gain their respect. It doesn\u2019t have to be free for all, but allowing her to consult you about behavior/punishment is completely fine. It can start gradually, with continued conversation.

I do understand why your wife is upset; I hope she agreed to the \"you have no role in my kids' lives\" boundary with her before you got married otherwise, she probably won't stay long. For example, if you're away and one of the kids acts up, they get away with it with no consequences until you get back? That's not healthy for anyone.", "YTA. Your wife should have a say in how the children are disciplined, you're a family now. Or is she just supposed to basically live apart from the children and just warm your bed at night and cook your meals while your *ex* has more say in your house than she does? I have a feeling you won't be married too long.

She is probably feeling like she doesn't have any say over what goes on in her house, which is not a good feeling. What exactly is the procedure for when the kids misbehave under her watch? Actually, let me back up. Is she expected to watch the kids alone or help with childcare? If she is, then together you need to come up with a system, much like you have with your ex. If they misbehave when she's watching them, what does she do, just say, wait until your dad gets home? I mean, that's kind of setting the kids up to just walk all over her, if there are no consequences. \n\nI understand where you're coming from as the parents being the ones to dole out discipline.

That's not very healthy at all.", "So, OP is not home, one of the kids is acting badly and knows his wife can do nothing about it; they can act any way they want, and she's supposed to let them.

I don\u2019t think you understand how arrogant a step mother can get once she has power over those kids.

If an aunt or an uncle has charge of a kid, they try to connect with them.  This stepmom just seemed a little too focused on discipline and not enough on connection.  In my experience kids tend to really resent stepparents who try to be too much of a disciplinarian, it's much better coming from the parent.", "Exactly.

If they kid hit them, they could put them in a timeout (or whatever the parents do), but then it\u2019s the step parents job to report to the bio parent what happened and the bio parent can escalate if they see fit.", "If she is putting up with his conditions, that's pretty much what he has already...", "Depends on the kids; I just think the OP went too far in basically telling his wife that she can't stop them from ripping up one of her dresses or flushing her jewelry down the toilet unless he says so.

She may not be just a maid, but she definitely can't feel that it is her home either.", "Three thumbs up!", "That type of boundary would be reasonable I agree; the dad didn't say anything like that though; a timeout is still discipline, just fairly mild.", "That's the most ridiculous thing I've read on AITA .Good night.", "\"she has tried to discipline them, ground them, etc, I\u2019ve stopped her explaining she isn\u2019t a parent and the only ones who can decided those things about our kids\" The example I gave is literally what the OP said he wanted.
