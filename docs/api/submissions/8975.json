My acquaintance, (F22) is Indian and invited me to a dinner party at her house with a lot of people I am friends with.

I was a bit frustrated at this point, because I already explained that I can\u2019t handle spice, and this \u201cdessert\u201d (I think she said it was called \u201cjaleney\u201d or something?) was fried and dripping in red hot oil. I told her that this dessert looked super spicy, and that I could not try it. She insisted that it wasn\u2019t spicy, but I know that people (especially those used to eating spicy food like Indians) have vastly different ideas of what constitutes \u201cspicy.\u201d I said to her that I probably would find it spicy, and refused again. She got upset at this and avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nThis morning, a bunch of my friends messaged me and said I was being rude by not trying the dessert, and it was apparently racist of me to assume that it would be spicy. I honestly was just trying to protect my sensitive taste buds from a fiery death. AITA?\n\nEdit: A helpful commenter let me know the name of the dessert is called Jalebi!

As for Indian desserts, almost all of them are super sweet, like way sweeter than your average American or European desserts, and I honestly can\u2019t think of a single Indian dessert that\u2019s spicy.

Jalebi literally sounds like sweet dessert that looks like a mini funnel cake from the fair... You're not racist, but you sound annoying.\n\n Just because it is orange or red doesn't mean it's spicy.

You've probably had gastro issues in the past having anything spicy, and full avoidance is a protective mechanism for you. But the only way to deal with it is to expose yourself to it.

My acquaintance, (F22) is Indian and invited me to a dinner party at her house with a lot of people I am friends with. When I got there, she tried to offer me some food, but I declined and told her I couldn\u2019t handle spice, and she took the food back to the kitchen. \n\nLater in the party, she came to me with some sort of Indian dessert and asked me to try it. I was a bit frustrated at this point, because I already explained that I can\u2019t handle spice, and this \u201cdessert\u201d (I think she said it was called \u201cjaleney\u201d or something?) was fried and dripping in red hot oil. I told her that this dessert looked super spicy, and that I could not try it. She insisted that it wasn\u2019t spicy, but I know that people (especially those used to eating spicy food like Indians) have vastly different ideas of what constitutes \u201cspicy.\u201d I said to her that I probably would find it spicy, and refused again. She got upset at this and avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nThis morning, a bunch of my friends messaged me and said I was being rude by not trying the dessert, and it was apparently racist of me to assume that it would be spicy. I honestly was just trying to protect my sensitive taste buds from a fiery death. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nThey told you the name of the food.

I hate being pressured to try food I don't want. My MIL does it to me all the time. However you mainly acted ignorant and made assumptions. Just say no or ask what's in something. You can be annoyed that you were being pressured to eat, but your friend can be annoyed that you wouldn't believe them when they said it wasn't spicy. Indian food is fragrant from the variety of spices used... and spices don't mean spicy. It's called flavor. I honestly wish I could eat more Indian but turmeric and cumin trigger migraines for me and I have to be careful.", "Jalebi isn\u2019t spicy. It\u2019s fried flour covered in sugar syrup or honey syrup. For me YTA because you show a complete lack of trust in your friend not to give you something spicy. You basically insinuated she\u2019s a liar. Also, google is free and you could\u2019ve looked Jalebi up in 20 seconds if you didn\u2019t believe her.

Who tf thinks dessert can be spicy???

I love it, it does not love me back.  When you ask someone, is this spicy, and they say oh it's really mild,  maybe to them it is, to me it is fire. Why should you make yourself eat something that you know is going to bite you?", "Jalebi are delicious and you shouldn\u2019t have gone to the party at all if you were that rude that you wouldn\u2019t eat anything at all. There are so many non-spicy options. Trust me I was raised by English parents that were not adventurous eaters and I learned to love spicy food (and travelled all over India) and there are Indian foods you can definitely eat. Spicy heat is delicious but each dish and each family have different recipes and spice mixes and comfort levels with heat. \n\nTheir breads (naan/roti/chappati/paratha) unless stuffed are almost unanimously mild. Their desserts rarely have spices that are hot (things like cardamom and clove and cinnamon are more common in their sweets but they are aromatics and not hot - unless cinnamon is hot to you). \n\nYou should try to accept that you have a rigid idea of Indian culture that is incorrect. Yes Indian cultures do often have highly spiced foods. But they also have mild, sweet, savoury, all the flavours. Their cuisines use contrast to bring out the best in each dish! And you are the one missing out on one of the cuisines that I will go to my grave arguing is the best in the world. \n\n\nYTA- but from ignorance and not maliciousness. You can apologize to her and tell her you were scared and weren\u2019t intending to be racist.

The cuisine is immensely flavourful, but not all hot. I avoid the spicy dishes and still find plenty of food I love. One of my favourite dishes is Butter Chicken, which is a creamy and not-remotely-hot curry dish.\n\nYou\u2019ve decided in your mind that all Indian food is spicy/hot.

You were rude in making assumptions and lumping all the cuisine together.\n\nIncidentally the dessert you mentioned was probably jalebi and is not spicy.

There was no red hot oil involved (I mean it was fried in oil, but not spicy oil).", "YTA. Not wanting to try spicy food is fine, but being willfully ignorant of Indian cuisine when your friend has literally told you 'it's not spicy' makes you an asshole. I bet you think tomatoes are spicy, after all they're red right?", "Yeah YTA. Is everything red spicy now? Do you avoid strawberries out of fear? Avoiding the food and playing it safe is one thing, but a desert you've clearly been told isn't spicy is taking it to extremes.

The orange color comes from saffron threads.  You can look up the recipe online.", "YTA. A color does not mean something is spicy.

Regardless of the reason.

India is an entire subcontinent full of a wide variety of cuisines, and not all of them are spicy.

That being said, I would never go over to another person's house and tell them I won't even try what they've cooked. That's just rude.

Especially if you're going to someone's house and know that's the cuisine they'll serve. Also you can just say something like \"I'd love to try that, but I'm nervous because it looks spicy. Is there any chance you know the ingredients so I can set my mind at ease and really enjoy it?\" Since the ingredients to Jalebi are: fat, flour, sugar, baking soda and maybe saffron, cardamom, and/or rose you'd know you're safe, since only members of the pepper family have capsaicin.

You acted based on a stereotype while your friend was trying to show some hospitality because you are a guest in their home.", "yeah it\u2019s DEFINITELY stereotypical and ignorant of you to assume that the dessert would be spicy cause you\u2019re assuming all Indian food is spicy, also ever heard of FOOD COLORING MAYBE???
