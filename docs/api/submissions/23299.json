By your own admission you are no longer close and weren't even expecting one, maybe she is still an inch closer to the rest of the group than she is to you or maybe she just never liked you quiet as much.

When he did, you couldn't have \"kept your mouth shut\" because you didn't know something was up.

Starting with her attempt to exclude you, while pretending that the whole group was going to be getting together. Did she think none of the others would notice you were missing on the day? Or did she maybe think that, if asked, she could make up a lie about you declining the invite or being sick and have it believed without question? (rhetorical questions)\n\nBecause odds are, given the reaction you've already seen, it would be noticed, someone would ask, and someone would have checked up on any excuses she gave. Blowback from others in the group was probably inevitable at some point, it was just a matter of timing.\n\nYou've done everything right so far.\n\nAt this point, best thing to do is wash your hands of the whole deal. You already said what needed to be said to the rest of the group.\n\nAny grief they're sending Kayla's way is being triggered by things Kayla herself is saying.

We\u2019ve been best buds for over 20 years. We group chat all the time but only get to meet up rarely because of everyone has families. But when we do meet up it\u2019s like no time has passed.\n\nBut we had this one guy that used to be in our group. Like a legacy member. He was still in the group because he always had been. But he had become even more narcissistic than he once was. Even become racist and started hanging out with the wrong crowd. We told him for years that he was changing and we\u2019d pull him up on his shit. Unfortunately or fortunately, after a big falling out, we just had to drop him from the group about 3 years ago.
