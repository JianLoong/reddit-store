Nothing happened to make us drift apart, Just growing up and losing contact. still friends but not \"talk all the time. hang out regularly\" friends if that makes sense. But of course some of us stayed close friends with eachother.\n\nOne person from this friend group \"kayla\" (fake name) (28F) is getting married in a few weeks. I didnt get an invitation but i wasnt hurt. i understood. we didnt stay close friends. but then i was hanging out with my best friend \"bob\", (28M) who was also in that friend group, a few days ago and he mentioned that he's going to the wedding. i was a little surprised but i just told him i hoped he had a good time. he asked if i was going and i told him no, i didnt get an invite. he said that was strange because everyone else from the group was going. two of them were plus ones as they were dating or married to other ones who got an invite. but they were all going and kayla knew it and even told bob she was really happy that \"the gang was getting back together on her special day\". i told bob i was kinda hurt by that but i didnt want to make a big deal of it.\n\ntwo days pass. kayla calls me fuming mad that i was \"whining that i didnt get an invite to anyone who would listen\". I told her that i wasnt. i explained to her what happened. she said that shes been getting texts and calls from other members of the group saying that she should have included me and wanted me to put a stop to it. i said i would do my best and that i was sorry that i caused her this trouble. she thanked me for the apology and hung up.\n\ni called bob and asked him why he spread this around and he said that he didnt mean to. he felt bad that i was hurt and he wanted to ask someone else from the group if they knew why i wasnt invited and she spread it around i guess and everyone wanted to know why kayla cut me out specifically so they started asking her. so i made a facebook group chat with all of them and politely asked them to leave kayla alone. that i was just hurt in the moment and vented about it to my best friend and thats where it should have stayed. they all said okay and apologized to kayla.\n\nyesterday kayla made a facebook post ranting about me without saying my name and said she had to hire security and give them a photo of me to make sure i didnt try to crash the wedding. something i would never do. the comments under the post were calling her out. she called me again and screamed at me that i was ruining her wedding and told me that some of the friends are considering not going to the wedding now. and now im just wondering if i should have just kept my mouth shut or stood up for myself or what\n\nEDIT: i woke up to 160 something notifications on this and im doing my best to answer questions and all that. but to answer some frequent questions and points:\n\nIm bi, i have no knowledge of kayla ever having a crush on me, i dont know if her fiance is gay or bi, i never dated kayla, i dated someone else from the group back in highschool into college but the relationship ended amicably and im still good friends with her, the only notable event that might have made things weird is that we all went skinny dipping once when we were 16 but nothing else really happened there and as far as i know, nobody was creeped out or anything by it. there was no big political shift in any of us that may have divided us.", "created_utc": 1690507278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bji43/aita_for_saying_that_i_was_hurt_that_i_wasnt/", "score": 2906, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the end of the day no one should have said anything to her about not issuing you an invite. By your own admission you are no longer close and weren't even expecting one, maybe she is still an inch closer to the rest of the group than she is to you or maybe she just never liked you quiet as much. Who knows. You don't really hang out anymore so she doesn't have to have a reason not to invite you even if she invited everyone else.

Or did she maybe think that, if asked, she could make up a lie about you declining the invite or being sick and have it believed without question? (rhetorical questions)\n\nBecause odds are, given the reaction you've already seen, it would be noticed, someone would ask, and someone would have checked up on any excuses she gave. Blowback from others in the group was probably inevitable at some point, it was just a matter of timing.\n\nYou've done everything right so far.\n\nAt this point, best thing to do is wash your hands of the whole deal. You already said what needed to be said to the rest of the group.\n\nAny grief they're sending Kayla's way is being triggered by things Kayla herself is saying.

We\u2019ve been best buds for over 20 years. We group chat all the time but only get to meet up rarely because of everyone has families. But when we do meet up it\u2019s like no time has passed.\n\nBut we had this one guy that used to be in our group. Like a legacy member. He was still in the group because he always had been.

You would think it's only all about what the bride and groom want, but we all know that's rarely the case.  The parents (especially those who are paying for it) definitely get input, if not full control over the guest list.  It can get really interesting when one family is significantly larger than the other.  If I want to invite one cousin, then that means I have to invite all of them.  And If I invite all of mine, that means my spouse to be needs to invite all of theirs as well.  So for the sake of having one person with a +1 attend, you are now obligated to invite 100 others.  All of them may not choose to attend, but you can't turn away any who do.  At $50-300 per person, it can get out of hand really quickly.\n\nOf course there's going to be the core group that MUST be invited.  All immediate family members obviously, but then there are co-workers of the parents who get invited, along with family friends (of the parents).  All of this happens before you even start inviting friends of the bride and groom.  Each of whom get a +1.  \n\nSo there was the old friend group.   At some point it becomes a practical issue to not invite every single person you've ever been friendly with.  You have to draw the line somewhere.

There was clearly no obligation or expectation that he would be invited.\n\nPoint is, OP wasn't \"excluded.\"  He just never quite popped up on the radar as someone who needed to be included.  She sat down and thought about all of the people who she can remember interacting with over the last several years, and OP didn't make the list.  It's unfortunate that other invited guests decided to take it upon themselves to stir up unnecessary drama and make it into something it's not, but that happens sometimes.  \n\nI'm guessing all potential malicious and nefarious reasons aside, she invited people until she hit a hard limit, and then stopped.  Reviewed the list to be sure that she had everyone she really wanted there, and then mailed them out.  Unfortunately, OP didn't make the cut.

Guest lists are chaotic semi-alive beasts honestly. All this without mentioning my partner's situationship ex objecting and what shall only be referred to as the Tea and Biscuit Saga.

And I've also mostly only ever moved in the context of being a renter in an overpopulated city with notoriously bad landlords during a housing crisis; it's very rarely been my choice to move and I've moved house nine times now in ten years. But I find it emotionally very hard because I feel like my home is being uprooted. I hate packing away all the stuff because it feels like I'm having to pull my own life apart, and it feels so futile unpacking it all properly because I know any settling-in I do is only an illusion because I'll have to lose the place again, so with every move I get worse and worse at unpacking my life and spend longer and longer in the horrible camping phase in the new place where nothing has a proper place to go. And your furtniture never really fits in the new rooms so you have to spend ages trying to not make rooms feel like weird cramped spaces with everything somehow fitted in at the wrong angles when a similar-but-not-the-same space had worked before. Also moving vans and deposits are a financial stressor of themselves. And cleaning and fixing stuff to a landlord's standard of 'it should look like no one has touched this since it was a show-home' is so stressful, and depending on the landlord, scary. And you always lose something in a move, whether that's because it goes in the awful rushed 'ahh just throw stuff in boxes' last batch, or because you try to keep it apart because it's special then it gets buried somewhere unexpected or moved by well-meaning in-laws; I haven't seen my jewellery box or my favourite childhood book in a couple of years. And stuff gets damaged. And you have to see family if they're helping, which of course I appreciate them wanting to help but sometimes family is difficult at the best of times, let alone in the middle of a move. Never mind the horror that is trying to find a new place in the first place that isn't covered in mould or a three foot square box. Yeah no...

It sounds like they're just as confused as you are. You shouldn't feel guilty over what's happening. All you did was express your disappointment that you weren't invited. You didn't make a scene and when you realized what happened you did intervene and got them to stop and apologize. Kayla was the one who escalated by making that post about security when there was no longer a problem.\n\nAs for your friends, I don't blame them for asking Kayla why you weren't invited when they learned that you weren't. Especially since she was making such a big deal about how this was also going to be a reunion among friends. Of course, they were going to be confused, and while their pushing for the answer may have been too much, I can understand their frustration getting the better of them if Kayla was refusing to give them an answer. And now that Kayla has made that post, it makes sense that some don't want to go anymore.\n\nIf you still feel guilt, send Kayla one more message. Tell her that you're sorry that she is dealing with this added stress, and it wasn't never your intention to cause this. Which is why you made that post to get the rest of your friends to stop and apologize. That you never had any intention of crashing the wedding and that you hope that she has a wonderful stress-free wedding.

But were OK.  \n\n\nThere is a major tourist city close by with 100's of hotels so I booked charter busses to do a circuit of the major hotels, and the town square, to pick / drop people off.  There was also a smaller bus to take people ad hoc if they needed to leave the venue during the reception as the main  centre only has a couple of taxis.  \n\n\nI put all of this information in the wedding invite, as well as hotel recommendations and maps. I also noted that there was a camp ground near by with no availability but if they wanted to camp, contact me.  \n\n\nI was super proud of myself, arranged a simple, low cost wedding avoiding the opinions of others.

It was all wants, not needs.   \n\n\nSometimes it wasn't real. I was told my auntie was furious with me and not coming because of accommodation.
