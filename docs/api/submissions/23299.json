By your own admission you are no longer close and weren't even expecting one, maybe she is still an inch closer to the rest of the group than she is to you or maybe she just never liked you quiet as much.

When he did, you couldn't have \"kept your mouth shut\" because you didn't know something was up.

Or did she maybe think that, if asked, she could make up a lie about you declining the invite or being sick and have it believed without question? (rhetorical questions)\n\nBecause odds are, given the reaction you've already seen, it would be noticed, someone would ask, and someone would have checked up on any excuses she gave. Blowback from others in the group was probably inevitable at some point, it was just a matter of timing.\n\nYou've done everything right so far.\n\nAt this point, best thing to do is wash your hands of the whole deal.

We\u2019ve been best buds for over 20 years. We group chat all the time but only get to meet up rarely because of everyone has families. But when we do meet up it\u2019s like no time has passed.\n\nBut we had this one guy that used to be in our group. Like a legacy member. He was still in the group because he always had been. But he had become even more narcissistic than he once was. Even become racist and started hanging out with the wrong crowd. We told him for years that he was changing and we\u2019d pull him up on his shit. Unfortunately or fortunately, after a big falling out, we just had to drop him from the group about 3 years ago.

You would think it's only all about what the bride and groom want, but we all know that's rarely the case.  The parents (especially those who are paying for it) definitely get input, if not full control over the guest list.  It can get really interesting when one family is significantly larger than the other.  If I want to invite one cousin, then that means I have to invite all of them.  And If I invite all of mine, that means my spouse to be needs to invite all of theirs as well.  So for the sake of having one person with a +1 attend, you are now obligated to invite 100 others.  All of them may not choose to attend, but you can't turn away any who do.  At $50-300 per person, it can get out of hand really quickly.\n\nOf course there's going to be the core group that MUST be invited.  All immediate family members obviously, but then there are co-workers of the parents who get invited, along with family friends (of the parents).  All of this happens before you even start inviting friends of the bride and groom.  Each of whom get a +1.  \n\nSo there was the old friend group.   At some point it becomes a practical issue to not invite every single person you've ever been friendly with.  You have to draw the line somewhere.  OP clearly stated that their friendship had waned over the years.   There was clearly no obligation or expectation that he would be invited.\n\nPoint is, OP wasn't \"excluded.\"  He just never quite popped up on the radar as someone who needed to be included.  She sat down and thought about all of the people who she can remember interacting with over the last several years, and OP didn't make the list.  It's unfortunate that other invited guests decided to take it upon themselves to stir up unnecessary drama and make it into something it's not, but that happens sometimes.  \n\nI'm guessing all potential malicious and nefarious reasons aside, she invited people until she hit a hard limit, and then stopped.  Reviewed the list to be sure that she had everyone she really wanted there, and then mailed them out.  Unfortunately, OP didn't make the cut.  But OP's nothing more than a distant waning friend at this point anyway, so that's fine.", "a similar situation happened to me. one of my best friends of 20+ years moved away for the last few years. i kept in touch and visited him at least 10x more than the rest of our friends. hell, he was IN my wedding. \n\nwhen the time came for his bachelor party and wedding, i found myself not invited. why? because i had to cancel one of my trips to visit him towards the end of covid due to being sick. he thought i didn\u2019t value our friendship anymore because of that. at least that\u2019s the only answer i got out of him. \n\nanyway, good riddance.", ">If really you want to mess with her, post pictures of yourself in various disguises.\n\nI laughed way too hard at this and if I were the OP I would've already started planning the photos!", ">probably took offence to something you said or did back in the day\n\nBingo, though my bets were on Kayla being jealous of OP for being cuter.
