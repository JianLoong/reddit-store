I was able to go to school with the help of loans and I worked very hard at this school, even graduating a semester earlier than expected. Currently, all of my own money is going to graduate applications. My mom (49f) has been very generous in helping me out with school by letting me take out parent plus loans for the entirety of undergrad. Last semester, I must have made a mistake and requested the entire year\u2019s loan for the fall when I should have split it between spring and fall. I remember telling her to watch out for a sudden large deposit into her bank account (the refunds go to the borrower) and that the money should be saved for the spring. She said she had forgot and that she was in a \u201cvery low mental place\u201d and that she spent the money on bills and other life necessities. She promised me she\u2019d make the money back and pay it by the time I graduated.\n\nLast night I called my grandmother and told her the situation. I was scared of being unenrolled from classes and barred from graduating. I told her this and said I wasn\u2019t asking for money but I was scared and angry and didn\u2019t know what to do. She said (without me asking) that she would pay and to not let this \u201cbecome a fight with my mother and potentially face estrangement\u201d.

She basically told me about how hard she works to make a life for me and that sometimes she thinks of abandoning my brother and I. We\u2019ve always had these sorts of fight where she threatens to leave and though I bit my tongue before saying what I wanted to, I told her to stop worrying about tuition because \u201cI figured it out and called grandma to help me\u201d. She was pissed because I went behind her back in a immediate family issue and fixing the problem would have made her feel better about the situation (even though I NEVER got an apology). She told me not everything was about me and that I was selfish before storming upstairs and slamming the door. I know she\u2019s supported me for the last several years and maybe I should have let her handle it, but her making several thousand dollars on top of life costs is not feasible and I am not risking my degree for that.\n\nSo AITA for going behind my mom\u2019s back when she said she\u2019d pay my college tuition?", "created_utc": 1704462960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z7fxh/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_didnt_want_her/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, how are you making this all about you and being selfish? That part really doesn't make sense to me considering that its YOUR money she used, and it was going to be YOUR degree. \n\nIt feels like your mom knowingly used your money, and is upset that other people now know.", "NTA.\n\nYou had an immediate problem, you fixed it.\n\nFinances can make for unsavoury arguments especially if people are sensitive to such issues - which it sounds like your mum (understandably) is. Without knowing more I don't want to speculate too much on the ins and outs of that argument and who was right or wrong, but taking care of your immediate financial well-being is not something to be ashamed of.", "NTA, that excess plus money, I would ensure your mother pays back.  I don't think her reaction is anything more than embarrassment because you spoke with your grandmother, therefore someone else is aware of her behavior.  You did what you had to do to ensure that funds were available to complete your education.  Good luck and thank you Grandma.", "She sounds mentally unstable. You did nothing wrong, wishing you the best OP.", "NTA your mother has issues.    This is not on you", "NTA, you did what you had to do.  Your mom should really get some therapy if she is openly thinking of \"abandoning my brother and I\".  Wtf kind of mom is that?  She needs to grow up and apologize.\n\nWhen I was in college and completely broke (working 30+ hr/wk and school full time), my health insurance accidentally sent a reimbursement check to my mom's address.  More than $1000 reimbursement for some dental work.  My mom took it and cashed it and didn't tell me.  I had to threaten to call the police before she admitted to it and paid me back.  We've never been the same after that and it's been 20 years.", "NTA. At this point,  you need to do what you need to do to graduate.  You can pay your grandmother back after you graduate.", "NTA, your relationship with your mum sounds... complicated. I get the conflicting feelings because she had previously helped you out, but at the end of the day she technically stole money from you that was meant to be for college. You were not wrong in going to your grandmother and I believe you know this. I'm guessing that if you could go back, you would still make the same call. Focus on your degree and get yourself a good job! good luck", "Info: you stated that your mom is \u201c\u2026letting you take out parent plus loans\u2026\u201d for the entirety of undergrad. So is the loan in her name, and you just fill out the paperwork? Or is it under your name?", "She stole your loan money and jeopardized your education. She could have discussed the financial situation with you regarding bills, instead her response is the money I robbed from you isn\u2019t about you don\u2019t be selfish.

The medieval Italians had a saying: a sin that's hidden is half forgiven already! It was a joke btw, even then. Anyway point is your mother was able to forgive herself easily especially when the sin was hidden and she bore no consequences. For her. But it could have had big consequences for you. She's not taking that into account. Totally NTA and your mom is. If she was in a tough spot again and it all came crashing down for you, would your mom 'fess up to family, or lie to them and say you screwed it up? I'm guessing the latter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
