It is \u00a3350 a month after tax so while it's not a huge raise, it's still a good size. Since I started this current job I have been consistently saving the same amount of money each month and I have said most of my raise is gonig straight into savings. I do plan to do this but I just decided for the first month of getting this pay, I would treat myself and instead of saving, I will get myself some nice things, go on days out, take my gf on more dates etc. \n\nI'll obviously pay rent and bills first and then with everything left over I plan to not save anything for the month and just spend it if I see something I like and then if I have anything left at the end of the mnoth I'll put it into savings. My partner has known about this plan for months and she has been fine with it. This weekend she said she thinks I should put at least \u00a3300 into savings. I told her she knew what myp lan was and that I'll be putting the money away from next month.\n\nShe said I was just planning on wasting the money and buying things just because I can which isn't true since I'm only gonig to be buying things I want. She said I'm being irresponsible but I just told her it was my money and this is hardly a common occurance. I pointed out she didn't seem to be complaining when I was planning to spend the money on dates but she said that was different since we'd actually get something out of that.\n\nI told her I would be getting something out of the things I'm planning to get myself but she jsut said I'm being irresponsible and not thinking about our future.
