If shared, it's clear why she wanted you to save. I hope you have personal savings, too.", "Info: did I get this right? You have stable financial situation, you have savings, you got a rise at work so you want to pamper yourself with onetime thing worth \u00a3350? And you are not planning to use it on gambling, drugs or hookers?", "OP shouldn't spend anything on \"we\" things, only \"me\" things since gf is so disapproving.  NTA.", "INFO: why is your girlfriend getting such a heavy say in how you spend your money?\n\nMy husband and I discuss finances every month, including purchases. I've never *told* him he couldn't spend his money on whatever he wanted. If it happens to be a gift (birthdays and Christmas etc) then I suggest he hold off but I've never made demands of his money like he doesn't make any of mine.", "NTA. I have a rule about pay rises, my rule is that the extra gets spent on something I wouldn\u2019t otherwise buy the first month. I reward myself for getting the pay rise to motivate the journey to my next one.", "NTA - are your savings a joint account?", "It was YOUR pay rise. NTA.", "Er, NTA.\n\nFirstly, it isn\u2019t a very large amount of money. Nothing that would necessitate a sit down discussion between a couple.\n\nSecondly, just because you\u2019re a couple doesn\u2019t mean every cent each of you earns belongs to the other. Many couples have joint AND separate account or finances, or fun money accounts entirely for themselves so they can spend as they please. \n\nNow, this is contingent upon getting some clarity around how your partner gets to spend their money. You haven\u2019t said it you\u2019re both very financially tight, or if there\u2019s any debt to clear, or what your financial split is. If this is contravening some agreement you made, you might then be the Ahole. But based on this I think you should have a very clear sit down talk about finances. Personally I advocate for separate accounts feeding a pre-set amount into a joint account. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for anyone to share ALL of their money given relationships don\u2019t last forever these days, statistics more than prove that.", "NTA she is trying to control how you spend your money. Why is she so insistent on you not getting yourself anything but paying for dates that include her are ok.", "Exactly this! If you mentioned a plan of spending the month's pay raise strictly on just her by spoiling her with getting her things she saw that she wanted there would be zero pushback from her. There would be none of the \"issues\" she is having with you splurging on yourself. \n\nNTA you earned this, you're an adult and can make your own decisions, and all your bills are paid up so go splurge and treat yourself as a reward for all the hard work you've done to earn this.", ">She means \"I would actually get something out of it\"\n\nExcellent translation. And not a good look on OP's GF. If his pay rise is 350 after tax, then he can affort to spend one month of that on himself without risking their (dubious) future.", "No, SHE would get something out of it. NTA. She\u2019s being very selfish", "NTA, honestly, if you were my BF/friend/relative, I would suggest you do exactly that.", "NTA \nFirst congratulations on the raise.\nSecond WTAF is your GF on about? It's okay to take her on dates but you're somehow irresponsible because you want to treat yourself for 1 paycheck?\nUnless you have a habit of getting into an overdraft, have \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s in debt and/or a problem with overspending, she's completely out of line.\n\nAlso, how would she like it if she wanted something and you told her she's being irresponsible with the way she spends HER money? She'd likely call you controlling and abusive", "NTA. A gf is not a wife. Do not disclose money until then. She needs to stay in her lane.", "I call this money \"heart money/ soul money\" since that's what it is for, after savings and paying bills you need a little something you waste on completely ridiculous and unnecessary things to feed our natural desire to buy things and pay for what's not needed, so later in life you don't feel regret that your wealth was never enjoyed by you.", "I think spoiling yourself for a single month is totally reasonable splurge. If it was every month, not so much ;)\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis is controlling red flag behaviour... It's one month and your own money. \n\nYou need to talk more about finances generally if you see this relationship becoming long term.", "NTA hi early, she\u2019s greedy and will always try to control you. Break up and find a suitable partner. She feels entitled to your money and doesn\u2019t share hers."]}
