She also said she thought my girlfriend wasn't right for me. \n\nThe first argument began where she accused my girlfriend of lieing about her pregnancy despite it being a sore subject for me and my girlfriend. I decided not to react at the time but as the days went on and my girlfriend couldn't stop thinking of her comments including a comment saying my girlfriend wasn't the right person for me. \n\nThe second argument started when i decided to tell her how hurt my girlfriend was and that we would like an apology. She started becoming aggressive threatening to come to my girlfriends house with her parents, which I later found out of my older half brother that she has used it before against him and its a scare tactic. She also later confirmed this to my girlfriend that she wanted to get a reaction off me so said this.. \n\nI decided enough for enough and I spoke to my half brother and asked who my biological dad was after years of being told by my mother that he was a liar and walked out before I was even born and when she was pregnant. \n\nI have come to find out today by contacting him that this is all a lie and in fact that he and his wife have been trying to contact me my whole life through my mom with no success as she continued to block them. I also found out that, with photos, my biological dad had actually looked after me every weekend as a newborn before my mom met another another guy and moved county. My dad and his wife have been really open with me and my girlfriend and have said they will be nothing but truthful in explaining everything and I have no reason to believe they may lie. \n\nI am angry at my mom for keeping this from me. The reason why I feel like an arsehole is because of my step dad and the fact he raised me like his own... \n\nAITA for finding my real dad?\n\nEdit: Does my step dad defend me? Yes he does and has done In the past but ultimately he does back her due to the fact they're married and he can only back me so much\n\nEdit 2: this is my boyfriends post on my account (girlfriend) he wants opinions before confronting but not his own account", "created_utc": 1686947312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b75ob/aita_for_finding_my_biological_dad_after_an/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may need to find a way to reduce contact with her for your own well-being; it sounds like you are old and mature enough to lead your own life anyway. \n\nHope your relationship with your bio dad will be better. Maybe you can reach out to your step dad in the future, when you're in a more stable place."]}
