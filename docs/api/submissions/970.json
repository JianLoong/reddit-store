That sounds like how my college apartment was. We each paid the same rent and had our individual leases. You don\u2019t have to switch and there\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to switch. For us, when we re-signed, we stuck with the same rooms since we each individually signed another term on our leases. If she already re signed the lease for another year with that specific lease, tough luck on her."]}
