Despite our careers and families, back then my brother and I would hit up the gym twice a day for hours and in our heads basically competing for the better physique and what not. Now I understand that way of life was not emotionally healthy for either of us, but it took a tragic loss that forced me to go to therapy to understand that. A year and a half ago, my best friend passed and I was absolutely heart broken, I fell into a very bad mental state where I admittedly stopped going to the gym and I put on about 60 pounds. I\u2019ve been in therapy for some months now and since then I have lost close to 15 pounds. My amazing wife has been the angel that she is throughout this entire journey and has loved me and shown me that she loves me at all stages of this journey and I\u2019m just very lucky to have her.\n\nWith all that being said, Sunday I was at a 4th of July barbecue at my brothers and everyone was swimming and having a great time. I was hesitant on going swimming because no one has seen me without a shirt except for my wife in a year. But I pumped myself up to get into the pool without my shirt on and I had a good time. As I got out of the pool to grab myself a drink, my brother who was standing by the pit asked me when I was gonna get back in the gym with him to \u201cshed that weight off\u201d as he was sure that Kelly(my wife) preferred my old body. Before I could say anything my sister in law(his wife) chimed in and said \u201cyeah, cause if Paul were to put on weight like that, I\u2019d be out of here.\u201d Him and her just laughed it off as I just sort of stood there. I then said \u201cthat\u2019s sad that you would end your marriage over a bit of weight gain, and thankfully my wife isn\u2019t as cold as you and loves me at every stage, even as fluffy as I am right now.\u201d I then turned to my brother and said \u201cI\u2019ve actually been back in the gym for a few months now and I would prefer not going back with you.\u201d I then walked away and thought that was the end of the whole ordeal. About 10 minutes later, my brother grabs me away from my wife and starts yelling at me how I need to apologize to his wife and calling me all sorts of obscenities. I told him I wasn\u2019t apologizing, but I would leave. So grabbed my wife and left. It\u2019s been 2 days now and I\u2019ve been receiving multiple calls and texts from different family members calling me the AH?

You spoke the truth and if they feel the sting of guilt... then good. I'm glad your wife loves and supports you. Sadly, that is lacking a lot these days. Tell them you'll apologize... when they do. Because insinuating your wife only loves you for your body was cold and callous. Don't let them destroy your journey, keep going forward and ignore them.", "NTA. It was an offensive way for him to ask, but it was a really offensive response from his wife. You're a lucky man to have a wife who obviously loves all of you, not just the outside, and you were right to point that out when they started saying stupid things.\n\nThey're just mad because they realized in that moment how shallow they both are, and they got defensive about it instead of looking in a mirror.", "NTA are these same family members telling you you\u2019re an asshole also saying the same to your brother and his wife for commenting on your weight in front of others and putting words in your wife\u2019s mouth? IMO you just responded with the truth and they\u2019re mad they got called out.", "NTA. You handled that situation fine. You don't need them in your life tbh.", "NTA. Their insecurities, projection, or whatever you want to call the cause of their need to put others down is THEIR problem. Miserable people only tolerate and make each other miserable. Everyone else can and usually does cut them off or enforce stricter boundaries. Food for thought.", "NTA. You told them the truth and annihilated both of them. You're a complete savage and its brilliant.  Damn, it sounds like the whole family is shook.\n\nThe two pretties will be reeling for a while. Probably nobody has put a mirror up to them like that before.", "What is it with the freakin sh*tty family members and friends who take the ahole\u2019s side in some of these posts?! \n\nWhat you said was fantastic! Sucks that no one chimed in to agree, because you were 100% in the right! nta", "NTA at all.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and that that's what it took to turn your life around, but honestly, so incredibly impressed with you. Whatever weight you may have gained in your grief is completely understandable, and ironically, it sounds like what you've found since then is BALANCE . . . a healthier place where yes, you may choose to lose some more, but it won't be in service of some vain ideal, but of your health and what feels right. You've gotten therapy, and connected emotionally with your wife in a way that is beautiful to read about, and learned that she really, really loves you unconditionally, which is such a special thing. It sounds like you're on a wonderful path that your brother should actually be envious of. And you handled his and his wife's ugly comments with a grace and patience that shows how far you've come with therapy. Because YOU know that what he's living isn't really all that fulfilling.\n\nAnd that's the thing, isn't it? A lot of people here will focus on how obnoxious he and your SIL were, and that's not wrong. But at the end of the day I'm mostly just sad for them. Because his wife literally said the quiet part out loud, that she wouldn't even want to be with him if he didn't fit a physical ideal. And that's so, so hurtful. And however much he may grin and mock you, some part of him has to be desperately aware of that . . . that the love he gets is conditional, and perhaps that is why he behaves in such an ugly fashion.\n\nYou are NTA. I'm glad you're getting healthier in ALL the parts of your life. He could learn from you.", "NTA. You hit a nerve with your brother and his wife obviously! Your wife sounds like a doll!", "Nta, your brother and sil acted like pricks and got rightfully smacked down, they don't get to be pissed", "do you even lift, bro?\n\nsorry, -- nta i think, but i wonder if that was just a joke by sil, and/or they were trying to be light hearted and \"of course he's gonna shed all that weight now that he's back up to speed\"? \n\nor he's a dick, but that's up to you to figure out. \n\nif they were just joking, and delivered it poorly, then i could see your rather defensive response being a bit aggro. not that they don't deserve a little reality check, but might be a whole lot of misunderstandings and nonsense which seems like a poor thing to ruin a once close relationship", "ESH He was an ass. You overreacted. You were an ass. He overreacted. You DO owe his wife an apology. She was trying to diffuse & make light of your brother\u2019s comments, and you skewered HER.

Your brother was rude and shallow, and his wife was worse. Their real problem is that you called them on it and exposed them for who they are.  I'm sure the line is \"it was just a joke.\"  That is always what people say when they've been called on behaving badly.  They tried some low level shaming BS on you to make themselves feel good (because they're \"prettier than you are\" right now, which they think makes them better than you are) and you ripped off their masks.  Of course they're going to be mad.  Just because they're mad doesn't mean you're wrong . It means you've grown (good for you!) and they haven't.  But a large part of our culture says that we can shame and abuse people with any kind of physical difference, including fluffiness, and they can't fight back.  Your family wants you back in that second / submissive role.  Don't go!"]}
