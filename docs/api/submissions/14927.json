He needs to know that your sensory struggles are not something to joke about. \n\nI am sorry your husband is being an AH, OP!", "NTA \n\nSomehow him working with disabilities himself makes this so much worse", "NTA but if you enjoy the kind of jokes and pranks that sometimes turn mean, maybe you need a safe word.", "They are not harmful, they are neutral. Just like you can have a mild headache or a severe one.", "No mean no.  Stop means stop. Take a second and really think about what your son is learning when he watches his dad hear his romantic partner say no and he ignores it.  He is never going to learn that no must always be listened to if he knows his dad doesn't think it's important when you are having fun.  \n\nDo I sound overly dramatic?  Maybe, but I learned in collage the guys who don't listen to you when you say no and stop in less important circumstances won't suddenly start listening when the stakes are higher.", "I find it low key kinda terrifying that someone who works with autistic people (some of whom probably can\u2019t advocate for themselves) can very callously disregard someone\u2019s sensory trigger.\n\nMakes you wonder what he does at work.", "THIS. Not to mention what he is teaching his son about consent.", "I learnt I couldn't cope with microfiber when I bought a duvet cover online bc I liked the picture on it, put it on my bed and lay down, and immediately felt nauseous and started crying. horrible stuff. I can cope with it for my glasses cloth but that's it!", "You know you have it very good in life when a color, pattern, and texture is the biggest worry you have. \n\nWe have people in the US with no access to Healthcare or clean drinking water. People who don't know when their next meal is coming in.", ">And: do you want him to treat you like an equal partner, or like one of his clients? He is your husband, not your caretaker.\n\nI have to assume that you mean that being treated like an equal partner involves the concept of consent, yes?\n\nOtherwise, Yikes.", "i don't think it's overdramatic at all, i think you're spot on. this is the perfect time to show their son that no means no and fun can be stopped at literally any time.", "would it be useful to have a safe word?", "ASC and ASD are both commonly used in the UK.", "Do you have a smooth one, or one that looks more like a regular towel? The last type is relatively new, but feel a lot more like a regular towel. Still not exactly the same, but (to me) not squeaky at all.", "To me it feels like grippy and slidey at the same time. I used to feel the same way when I had to touch a chamois, especially if it was a natural one. Ick.", "Op not liking corduroy is taking away people\u2019s healthcare and poisoning the water supply\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21", "Fuck that. If you have to resort to \"safe words\" for basic human empathy and respect, the whole man is trash and should be thrown out. My ex used to claim that words like \"no\" and \"stop\"  and \"you're hurting me\" didn't \"pull him out of the headspace enough\" and he \"needed an out of context word\" to break his focus. If OPs husband can't respect her bodily autonomy when she uses her actual words, he needs to go before they teach their son that it's an okay way to treat women and women will allow that kind of treatment. \n\nGuilt tripping and gaslighting her after that her disability \"isn't that bad\" is abusive behavior, but he needs to recognize how awful his actions and words were before there's hope for this to get better. Healing needs to come from him, this isn't something OP can fix or force him to fix.", "Indeed, hence my mentioning of a British nightclub as an example of over simulation lol", "Yeah, I have a quick-dry microfiber towel from REI and it almost feels like suede.", "Yeah, that's a smooth one... These days there are also ones with tiny loops, just like an ordinary towel. Way easier on the skin. Also a bit more bulky, but way less bulky than a normal towel...", "NTA I work onboarding employees to support kids with autism and other disabilities.\n\nThis is an immediate red flag in my opinion as to your husbands fitness for his job.", "Info:  Do you think of yourself as being Disabled?", "Ableism broadly exists in two flavors, where people think you're \"Too disabled to have autonomy\" or \"Not disabled enough for accomodations\". Your husband is displaying the latter, NTA", "Wanted to say N A H because sometimes you realise to late that a joke is not a joke anymore and that can just happen. But as he didn't apologize and instead said that you were overreacting: NTA", "NTA.\n\nFellow adult diagnosed autistic here. He is treating you the same as my mother treated me as a child. She would just laugh at my meltdowns and tell me to stop being a \"drama queen.\" \n\nYour dick of a husband is being ableist whether he likes it or not. He is not familiar with autism is he thinks you can only be truly autistic if you can't live on ur own. \n\nFull dick.", "NTA. And he's in the wrong line of work if this is his way of thinking.", "NTA. \n\nYou enjoyed the joke, and when it went too far, you used Serious Voice so the situation could de-escalate and go back to a baseline you were comfortable at.\n\nYou didn\u2019t freak out, you didn\u2019t scream and cuss at him, you just said \u201ctoo far\u201d. And then your husband started pouting and bullying you.\n\nAbsolutely not. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s because you have a sensory issue or just got annoyed and bored. You get to say \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d. And he needs to back off.", "NTA. You need to contact your husbands place of emplacement, if he thinks torturing people with autism is funny, he should absolutely not be employed somewhere where he has access to many people who may not be able to communicate that he is harming them. Additionally, I would contact a divorce attorney. He just doesn\u2019t seem like a safe person.", "NTA. I have a grandma who works the same as your husband. And even she's delusional with disabilities. I don't get why people go into a field if they're just going to be like that. Also, he's a jerk and sounds kinda abusive, but uses jokes to cover it up.", "NTA but i question if you\u2019re husband is cut out for his job. He doesn\u2019t get to decide if someone is disabled enough to be real. He\u2019s not the authority on this. I wonder how often he trivializes other peoples disability because they don\u2019t live up to his idea of what that looks like", "My sister, who also works with disabled people, routinely does this to me, while being wonderful with her clients. \n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t abuse her clients. Just her family members. This is common. Because abusers can easily pick and choose who they abuse. \n\nHe\u2019s probably just abusing her, because people who are ND are easy to manipulate and abuse\u2026 he may have even picked her subconsciously for that reason. \n\nWhich is why she needs to come here and seek validation on whether she\u2019s wrong or not when she\u2019s clearly not. \n\nJust some fun little abuse facts. He\u2019s totally aware what he\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s wrong and how it\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s trained in it. He\u2019s just also an abuser.\n\nJust like how my ex husband \u201clost control\u201d and beat me but never ever seemed to lose control with his coworkers. It\u2019s selective.", "Also, wether you have high or low support needs can change by the day, so it\u2019s really gross for anyone to ever try to categorize the \u201cseverity\u201d of autism when it literally changes constantly it\u2019s one of the main features of the disorder", "I'm so sorry you experienced this. My words can't change a thing but my thoughts are with you and maybe this is at least something.", "Very true, if you are on the spectrum and there's another condition involved that can make it very variable day to day", "That's the 9th plane of hell...", "It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m out of it now. Maybe me talking about abuse cycles openly can help people see how they progress and gtfo before it progresses to physical violence like it did in my case. I\u2019m also \u201cmildly ASD\u201d which people assume means I can control all my sensitivities or some shit? Or that I\u2019m always playing things up? Anyway\u2026. \n\nMe and my husband used to play cutsie little games *exactly* like this too that always ended this way. Him pushing a little too far and then telling me I was too sensitive. \n\nNow I\u2019m disabled from being punched in the face repeatedly. Shit progresses.", "Not at all just a trivial thing to be upset about.", "imo, if you're in the habit of joking around its sometimes neccesary to have safe words for when you are not, as its not always obvious. the other stuff i was not commenting on, but you do you obvs.", "The texture of corduroy literally makes her physically ill. We may not be able to relate, but certainly isn\u2019t trivial for her. It\u2019s not like she chose this, most people would like to not have their gag reflex set off by certain fabrics, but we can\u2019t all get what we want."]}
