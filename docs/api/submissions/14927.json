Since receiving my diagnosis, I've been able to reframe a lot of things in my life, and understand myself a lot better. For example, I've been able to recognise is that some things I have avoided my whole life are due to sensory issues. Certain sounds, textures, etc make me feel physically unwell. One of those textures is corduroy.\n\nYesterday, my husband and I were out shopping with our 6yo son. He took our son and the shopping cart to look at some clothes while I browsed another section. He then brought the cart over to me so I could watch our son while he tried on some jeans. I noticed a pair of shorts hanging from the cart, but didn't think much of it. When he came back from the fitting rooms, he gave me a cheeky look and asked if I liked the shorts. That was when I noticed that they were corduroy. \n\nMy husband and I have the kind of relationship where we routinely joke around, mess with each other, prank each other, etc and it's fine. So when I noticed this I knew he was joking around with me, and I jokingly overreacted, saying things like \"they are the worst thing I've ever seen in my life\" and \"if you buy those I'm going to divorce you\". Again, we were both joking around and it was fine. But then, he grabbed the shorts and started rubbing them on any exposed skin he could reach on my body (I was wearing a cropped tank top, so my arms and part of my belly were exposed). This is where things changed. As I said, the feel of it makes me feel physically sick, and I was actually gagging. Problem is, my son found this hilarious. I guess he thought, as my husband did, that we were still just messing around. But to me, this was taking it too far. My son was laughing while my husband was trying to rub the shorts on me, and I was desperately trying to avoid it. I asked him to stop, in a firm, serious voice, and he did, but he also made a comment about me not taking a joke, and that I was being ridiculous. At this point I did get annoyed, and told him that corduroy is one of my \"no no textures\", I REALLY don't like it, and that making fun of me for reacting the way I did was trivialising my disability. \n\nMy husband works as a disability support worker, and primarily works with people with intellectual disabilities, including autism. Many of his clients are unable to function independently. He thinks that because I can, my autism is less \"severe\" and shouldn't be considered a disability, so he really brushed me off. That hurt me, as I really really dislike labels like \"mild\" or \"severe\". I think these terms are hurtful and unhelpful.
