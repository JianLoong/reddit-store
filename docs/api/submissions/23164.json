Within a week she'd found a wildlife rescue place half an hour away and got a volunteering spot with them, and has been going to volunteer there for the past 3 weeks, one day a week. She also started researching how to build the enclosure and has some friends who said they would help her out...\n\nBut I've started to think this is a really bad idea. Firstly every time she's come back from volunteering she's brought this really horrid odor back into the house. The first time I passed it off as she must have slipped and fell in some awful mess there or something, but no, it's been consistent. The second time I talked to her about it and she rolled her eyes and said \"Oh it's not that bad, it was rough for my first hour or two but you really do get used to it, all animals have a smell like dogs/cats etc.\" Her clothes appeared to be all clean, but still carried the smell.\n\nSecondly it seems like it will be too much work for her, while managing school and work. But she promises she can make it work and says \"I get straight As, it's not fair to use that concern against me\"\n\nI know she'll be really mad and feel like she did a lot of work for nothing if I go back on my word and say we're not getting a fox, but I'm worried about the consequences of getting one.

Go to collage?  You can't bring a fox with you to collage or to an appartment.

That's on you.\n\nAlso, FWIW, the smell thing is not something you need to have a chief concern about. Working at a shelter creates a far different odor concern than having one animal, even if that animal is a fox, at home. Shelter's have dozens of animals and it's a much stinkier environment, that kind of smell isn't created by one singular animal.\n\nYour daughter has proven herself to be responsible - she has straight A's, she happily has worked this job, she's educated herself on the matter. Do her a solid and educate yourself on what ownership of this would look like. Have a frank conversation with her about whether it's reasonable to get an animal that she wouldn't be able to take to a college dorm with her.

She's met those conditions. Talk to the people who run the place she volunteers at about the smell.

One, for making a promise you never intended to keep. Two, for thinking a feral wild animal is okay to keep as a pet.

I think it's reasonable to apologise for not being able to keep that promise, and to find a way to make it up to her. she's going to be angry and upset, justifiably so imo, but absolutely do not let her get a pet fox. parents do make mistakes, no one's perfect, but what you do after making that mistake is really important. neither of my parents have ever apologised to me in my life, even when they've changed bad behaviour, and I notice.", "YTA for making the promise in the first place but I can't blame you for going back on that promise.

It\u2019s your job as an adult to help reign in her enthusiasm and help her face some harsh truths before bringing an innocent animal into the picture.\n\nAs a vet who has worked with a lot of exotic animals, the exotic pet trade is a huge pet peeve of mine. Most of these wild animals suffer greatly at the hands of inexperienced but well-meaning owners, be it physically, mentally, or both. In one state I used to visit for work, keeping foxes was legal and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for parents to buy fennecs and red foxes for their kids who just HAD to have one. I was able to keep tabs on a few of them, and the sad reality is that they all died premature, preventable deaths or sustained life-altering injuries. \n\nFor example, one fox died of heat stroke because the teen girl it belonged to didn\u2019t realise that foxes can\u2019t tolerate extreme heat (there\u2019s a reason we make winter coats from their fur, it\u2019s really fucking warm). She thought that because it\u2019s a wild animal it can live outside just fine. Another fox lost its front feet to an aggressive kennel mate. The owners were afraid their first fox was lonely so they bought a second fox and left them unattended overnight. Another escaped its enclosure and was hit by a car.  \n\nAre there a few private owners who are the exception to the rule? Sure. But the vast majority overestimate their abilities, underestimate the level of care these animals need, and the animals suffer and die.\n\nYour daughter is going through a period in her life where a lot of things are going to be changing, and introducing a captive wild animal into the mix isn\u2019t fair to anyone.

Go and volunteer at a resort or shelter for foxes so she can understand the work and care that the animals deserve. This can also open up better ways to communicate and quality time together.

They are very vulnerable to many diseases, including distemper and rabies, even if vaccinated. \n\n12. They are nocturnal, and will be very loud at night, always. \n\n13. Your city, county, and/or state may have laws against owning them, with hefty penalties for owning one. \n\n14. They are extremely loud during the day. \n\n15.

She could be saving that money for when she goes off to college/moves out or towards courses/additional education/whatever towards something she wants to pursue as a career. Yes it is her money but as a parent I would talk to her about what kind of money she is planning to end up spending, looking at the long term: she is saying she is happy to commit to spending $3000 a year on this hobby.

How is she going to get the fox there, does she drive and have her own vehicle or is she expecting to use the family vehicle to transport a sick fox (who may shit/piss all over the car)?\n* What are her plans for when she has graduated high school?

The fox was not adopted.\n\n\nI think you need to consider the entire household here. Can anyone other than your daughter tolerate the smell? If not then it has to be a no.

When you go to the zoo, the strong zoo odor you often smell is almost never dung (keepers keep the zoos clean) but musk. Most pet owners aren't too familiar, because popular pets don't produce hardly any musk - we've basically bred it out of them on purpose. Ferrets are the only semi-popular pet that produces a bit of musk and people freak out over even that.\n\nFoxes are **extremely** musky. They have glands all over their body that produce different gland secretions and they obsessively wipe it all over everything they can find, including you, your house, their food, their food bowls, their enclosure, the grass, etc. It's like an oil that gets a little bit on everything.\n\nMusk is meant for marking territory and is heavily water-resistant. It sinks into things (like skin) and \"marks\" them. It accumulates and gets worse over time.\n\nThat's before we even get to the urine, which they spray everywhere, also for marking territory, which smells like fox musk mixed with tomcat spray times 10. Awful. It also will not wash off.\n\nBottom line, foxes will deliberately make everything around them smell like them and showering won't help.", "To be pedantic, it wasn't a \"lie\"; it was a promise made with incomplete information that came and slapped OP in the face big time.

There is no such thing as \"fox food\" so your daughter will have to meticulously craft a balanced diet for this fox. As someone who worked in vet med most of not ALL homemade pet diets are lacking in at least one nutrient or more and the animal ends up with health problems.

Foxes are more social than cats, cats also didn't self-domesticate. They were domesticated by humans at two separate points in history, which is why domesticated cats are social (even what we call \"ferals\" are social and form colonies), but their ancestors the African Wildcats are NOT in the slightest and cannot even share territory with each other. We didn't put a ton of work into it, but we did feed and house cats intentionally to keep rodents out of our crops/storehouses/pantries. Cats aren't even universally agreed to be domesticated, and we've been beside them for over 2,000 years! Part of why foxes smell so damn bad is because they're not concerned with being hunted by one another like cats are, but they are indeed creatures of solitude, outside of being raised or raising their own young. However, I have been approached by hungry foxes without any coaxing, their nervousness more akin to a stray dog than a cat, never approaching the eagerness of a raccoon. They're comfortable approaching human territories, but as they're usually stealing or eating a pet, they have no reason to assume good relations between themselves and humans. There's a lot to suggest, including actual work done with foxes, that they'd be easier to domesticate than cats... By a lot, actually. When it comes to domestication, the question really isn't \"can we\" but \"should we,\" and I'm not sure there's a compelling argument against domesticating any animal we've already destroyed most of the habitats for, especially when there's a lot to suggest it can be a positive experience all around.\n\n**Now do I think OP is in a position to adopt a fox for her teenager?

It's not like anyone is taking foxes out of the wild to sell as pets. They're almost entirely fur farm rejects whose coats were deemed imperfect or otherwise unworthy of harvest. The captive fur industry has ended up breeding thousands of semi-tame animals who's coats would put them at a natural disadvantage were they to be released. Furthermore, because they're raised in captivity, they don't know how to survive in the wild. Responsible fox rescues will rescue the fur farm rejects before they're culled, foster them, and adopt them out to homes that are properly vetted for enclosure size, knowledge on fox care, and the amount of free time a prospective adopter would have for a fox, among other things. To me, adopting to a knowledgeable, capable, and responsible home is far more humane than culling an animal that someone thought wasn't pretty enough to slaughter for fur. The only issue is making sure the animal is placed in an appropriate home, which can require a lot of time and effort for a rescue that's already spread thin. There are fox breeders, of course, but those are an entirely different can of worms. Most fox breeders do selectively breed for temperament, though, so a domestically bred fox is generally going to have a much different temperament than a fox born in the wild.

I volunteer with a wildlife rehab and once I have my hours I will be getting my license. It\u2019s no joke and all the cute stuff social media shows is NOT reality at all! Even the cute cuddly baby animals still very much have wild instincts and as they age those instincts come forth even more. Hell just the other day we were all discussing this with one of our local ACO officers that has to deal with illegally owned wildlife calls pretty frequently. Social media has done a great disservice to everyone by not being realistic about what actually goes into managing wildlife.

The one living with her had hollowed out the back of the couch and was filling it with objects from around her house that she absolutely couldn\u2019t remove without it attacking her.

It's something to look into and may get you off the hook, BUT...\n\n...YTA for making a promise you had no intention of keeping, especially a promise that involves the care and keeping of a living creature. Wild animals aren't toys, fads, are hobbies. You should have taken the opportunity to teach your child that instead of making her an empty promise.", "What were you thinking??? Promising your daughter a wild animal, what\u2019s next?", "I do agree with this sentiment but it does depend on the foster situation it can turn into keeping it full time.  I fostered a raccoon who now is a full time pet due to the fact of how domesticated he became.  I attempted to have him reintroduced to the wild but was told with his behavior that he would not survive in the wild on his own as he really is just a pet at this point.  Foxes though are so much work I have fostered some crazy animals and have been approached about foxes and would never personally foster one.  Their urine is a god awful smell and it is so hard to get rid of and also they are full of energy constantly and can be very loud and vocal creatures.  I would def think twice before making any kind of decision on fostering a fox.", "This is it. Plus OP clearly didn\u2019t do that much research as it\u2019s quite well known that the smell of fox urine is terribly potent. It\u2019s believed to be up to 20x stronger than a cats. \nI follow a lady who has a few foxes that can never go back out into the wild due to abuse at fur farms and such that they were rescued from. She\u2019s talked openly many times about how foxes are not typical pets and shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. The smell from foxes will get into everything and it will never go away. But beyond that, they thrive on routine and can be quite destructive with household items. But they also need a HUGE outdoor enclosure for outdoor play that is both large enough and safe enough that they can\u2019t escape it either. \nAny good fox rescue would also be incredibly stringent on re-homing a fox. There\u2019s a chance they might deem the size of the house or the garden unsuitable. Some even go to the extremes of insisting that you have a jar of fox urine in your house for a month to see if you can cope with it. I think OP was a bit naive here even considering making this a promise. Especially when as most people have pointed out, this kid is still a teenager and it\u2019s unknown whether she will stay at home or not in a few years.", "I don't think OP has thought about what having this kind of pet long term would mean in terms of care. There are plenty of parents who refuse to get their kids regular pets like cats and dogs at this age bc they know their kid won't be around to care for it soon and they don't want to watch it while kid's at college.\n\nOP should consider if daughter wanted a puppy or a cat, would they be willing to care for it while daughter is away for college or work. If their reaction to a dog would be, no that's too much work or only if I have nothing to do with caring for it, then they *definitely* shouldn't get a fox. \n\nA dog or a cat she could eventually move out with her. She can't even legally own a fox in all 50 US states much less abroad. No apartment or house would lease to her if she has a fox listed as a pet. If OP goes through with getting the fox, they need to understand the fox would most likely be staying there for it's entire life and that he's going to be helping (or possibly doing most) of the care for the fox at some point, unless they send it to a rescue themselves.", "OP claims to have done a full day of research though.. and didn\u2019t manage to figure out that foxes smell?! She never took it serious in the first place, that makes her an AH imo", "Wow. Or don't make promises with incomplete information. But that's not what happened. OP made the promise, hoping the daughter would get discouraged. Just parent up and say no.", "It's not clear from the post whether it was a lie or a mistake.\n\n\"I expected the reality to deter her\" as well as the weak excuse about it being too much work do seem to suggest that OP never had any intention of following through.\n\nIf you Google pet foxes, the stink problem is going to come up immediately. There's no way OP did more than 10m of \"research\" and didn't come across that. If this is a genuine mistake caused by not having all the facts then it's a pretty stupid one since they somehow missed the number one drawback. If there is a wildlife rescue close enough for her to volunteer at then they should have visited it themselves to see how bad the smell is before agreeing in the first place.\n\nThe question should not be \"WIBTA\" for breaking the promise, that's the most sensible option at this point. It should be \"AITA\" because the damage is already done, OP is TA for either knowingly making a false promise or making one they didn't fully consider. The daughter won't \"feel\" she did all the work for nothing, she *did* do all the work for nothing. I hope OP feels appropriately guilty and finds a good way to make this up to her.", "Still makes OP an AH.", "No, it was a promise the parent never intended to keep. She set conditions she believed her child wouldn\u2019t be able to meet so the child would stop pestering her. It\u2019s like when my mom promised my little sister she could get a hedgehog if she paid for it herself, believing she would never be able to save 300 dollars at 14. Well, guess what? She underestimated how badly my sister wanted that thing, she was fucked, and Gatsby lived with us for 3 years. Only in this situation, it would most likely be an abandoned or injured animal who has become slightly tame and cannot go back into the wild, so it\u2019s a really big problem.", "Okay, love your SW reference haha! But to answer you, while I do think that animals rely heavily on humans to survive (whether it be through our conservation efforts or on the other side, our destruction of the planet), most animals were domesticated only for specific purposes. The \u2018purpose\u2019 for breeding foxes, I suppose, for companionship is already fulfilled by other domesticated animals like cats, dogs, some birds, etc.\n\nI do think that it\u2019s impossible to domesticate all animals (imagine mosquitoes urgh). Rather, what we should do is try our best to minimise our impact on the local wildlife.", "You're assuming that she was assuming, but I'm hoping that she was just hoping.  I suppose \"expected she'd be deterred\" is open to interpretation.", "Is bearded dragon poo that much worse than dog poo? What did it smell like exactly?", "I spent about one solid minute on Google, and saw three times that having a pet Fox is strongly discouraged and illegal in most states.

My friend was convinced that he didn\u2019t need to learn how to drive, move out, or even work more than four hours a day because we grew up with video game content creators becoming overnight millionaires and running companies in big cities. He figured because this one personality who lived with other personalities didn\u2019t drive or have his own place, he didn\u2019t need to, despite us living in the suburbs in a commuter town.

She's pretty much a recluse because the smell of fox urine does not come out.", "I follow a fox rescue on Facebook for cute fox photos so I know probably more than most people about how the process works. All their foxes are either fur farm rejects or breeder-obtained foxes obtained from homes that either didn't have them legally, or just realized they couldn't adequately care for them. But a vast majority of foxes adopted from rescues are fur farm rejects that wouldn't be able to survive if released into the wild.", "I feel so naive- I didn\u2019t realize that fox fur farming was still a viable business and thought the fur business was down to just trapping except for mink farms. No idea why I assumed this.", "Yeah, they're almost certainly sheltering her from the worst of it. I wouldn't be surprised if she'd seen some anti-pet fox messaging, but I'd also not be surprised at all if it's so far mild and easy to wave away as being against \"bad fox owners\" instead of \"all fox owners\". That's going to be the tough part in convincing her really: getting her to realize that she's not going to be the exception. (Which might be a bit harsh on her, but she's also trying to get an exotic pet that she likely won't be able to care for in a few years, so...)", "Speaking as a parent who has had to backpedal on a bad decision occasionally, I would not call OP a \u201cmassive AH\u201d.

It was more about not having fox poop inside.", "> \"YTA for making a promise that you never intended to fill.\"\n\nBut OP fully intended to let her daughter get a fox, so that point of yours is irrelevant.

Reminds me of my dad.", "First, consider that the rescue is multiple foxes and probably inside, and she's likely always doing dirty work there as a volunteer. So the smell of a single fox that you keep outside will be nothing in the range of the way she smells after volunteering.  \nYou definitely screwed up, and you might just have to accept you're the bad guy here and have her mad at you.   \nI can think of 2 possible options for telling her no that might soften the blow. As others have said, you could tell her that if she can't take it to school with her or where she plans on moving, then you will be sending the fox to the rescue she works at when she moves, so she needs to consider that scenario before she adopts. And 2, you should look into your local bylaws. I wanted a fox too, but most city bylaws ban them because they're considered \"exotic pets\", or maybe the enclosure isnt legal in your yard, so you might have a way out that you can blame on your  municipal government and save some face.   \nGood luck.

This is some frivolous fun thing, it\u2019s basically 24/7 volunteer work. \n\nSecond, ask her what she plans to do once she\u2019s in college. Either she won\u2019t be able to go away, or she\u2019ll have to commute to a local one from home. \n\nThird, ask her about how she\u2019s going to be able to afford both a fox and saving up for the future once she\u2019s an adult in her 20s. I don\u2019t know how long rescue foxes live, but I\u2019m guessing probably more than four years. \n\nFourth, I would just explain how you feel. I wouldn\u2019t start with backing out of the promise, but I would explain deeply why you\u2019re uncomfortable having this animal in your house. It\u2019s not like a cat or a dog or even a donkey, it\u2019s a wild animal. It\u2019s expensive, smelly, undomesticated, and she\u2019s bringing it into your comfort space and home for who knows how long. \n\nFifth, instead of being blunt, try to suggest a compromise. Maybe promise to help her pay for one once she has a stable home to raise one. The thing about being on the verge of graduating high school is that college is a very tumultuous time. You\u2019re moving around, and you don\u2019t have time for things like animals. I\u2019m a college student, and I would *love* to have a cat of my own. But I would never buy one right now, because I\u2019m constantly going back and forth for college, and my dorm situation is not spacious enough for an animal. Tell her to think about how she will take care of this animal long term, and to take into consideration when would be the best time for both her *and* the fox for this to happen. For me, it would be after college, once I have my own place and salary (that\u2019s when I plan on buying a cat). It should be the same for your daughter.\n\nI don\u2019t know what her plans are after high school. But she\u2019s dragging you into this by rushing to do this right now.
