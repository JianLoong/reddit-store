Within a week she'd found a wildlife rescue place half an hour away and got a volunteering spot with them, and has been going to volunteer there for the past 3 weeks, one day a week. She also started researching how to build the enclosure and has some friends who said they would help her out...\n\nBut I've started to think this is a really bad idea. Firstly every time she's come back from volunteering she's brought this really horrid odor back into the house. The first time I passed it off as she must have slipped and fell in some awful mess there or something, but no, it's been consistent. The second time I talked to her about it and she rolled her eyes and said \"Oh it's not that bad, it was rough for my first hour or two but you really do get used to it, all animals have a smell like dogs/cats etc.\" Her clothes appeared to be all clean, but still carried the smell.\n\nSecondly it seems like it will be too much work for her, while managing school and work. But she promises she can make it work and says \"I get straight As, it's not fair to use that concern against me\"\n\nI know she'll be really mad and feel like she did a lot of work for nothing if I go back on my word and say we're not getting a fox, but I'm worried about the consequences of getting one.

It\u2019s your job as an adult to help reign in her enthusiasm and help her face some harsh truths before bringing an innocent animal into the picture.\n\nAs a vet who has worked with a lot of exotic animals, the exotic pet trade is a huge pet peeve of mine. Most of these wild animals suffer greatly at the hands of inexperienced but well-meaning owners, be it physically, mentally, or both. In one state I used to visit for work, keeping foxes was legal and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for parents to buy fennecs and red foxes for their kids who just HAD to have one. I was able to keep tabs on a few of them, and the sad reality is that they all died premature, preventable deaths or sustained life-altering injuries. \n\nFor example, one fox died of heat stroke because the teen girl it belonged to didn\u2019t realise that foxes can\u2019t tolerate extreme heat (there\u2019s a reason we make winter coats from their fur, it\u2019s really fucking warm). She thought that because it\u2019s a wild animal it can live outside just fine. Another fox lost its front feet to an aggressive kennel mate. The owners were afraid their first fox was lonely so they bought a second fox and left them unattended overnight. Another escaped its enclosure and was hit by a car.  \n\nAre there a few private owners who are the exception to the rule? Sure. But the vast majority overestimate their abilities, underestimate the level of care these animals need, and the animals suffer and die.\n\nYour daughter is going through a period in her life where a lot of things are going to be changing, and introducing a captive wild animal into the mix isn\u2019t fair to anyone.

Go and volunteer at a resort or shelter for foxes so she can understand the work and care that the animals deserve. This can also open up better ways to communicate and quality time together.

The second time I talked to her about it and she rolled her eyes and said \"Oh it's not that bad, it was rough for my first hour or two but you really do get used to it, all animals have a smell like dogs/cats etc.\" Her clothes appeared to be all clean, but still carried the smell.\n\nSecondly it seems like it will be too much work for her, while managing school and work.
