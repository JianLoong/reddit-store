She and a girl at her school (Mary) have been competitive with each other in academics and sports since middle school. My daughter is at the top of the class currently but it has often switched between her and Mary.\n\nMy ex and I were called in for a meeting to Jane's school on Monday and it was not the typical type of meeting I am used to. To keep a long story short, a video started to circulate of my daughter saying some very racist things and using a very racist accent in regards to Indians. We live in an area with a large population of Indians. Due to an incident involving a student and racism a few years ago that ended terribly, the school has a very strict no tolerance policy when it comes to racism. Jane was expelled and she and my ex are trying to have this decision overturned by the school board.\n\nJane has said she is very sorry and she was only talking about Mary (Jane's bf broke up with her and started dating Mary) not all Indians, but I watched the video and that is definitely not how it came off. She also says if this isn't overturned she's afraid the college she is planning to attend will revoke her admission.\n\nI am close friends with some of the members of the board and could probably help my daughter but I don't want to. I've told my ex and my family that I don't know if I'll speak up for her at the meeting and they think I'm a bad mom. They agree she did a bad thing but they believe this shouldn't ruin her future. I think these are the consequences of her actions and she needs to deal with them.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't talk to my friends on the board and not speak up for her at their meeting?\n\nEdit: more important info that I didn't include and has been incorrectly assumed.\nJane is technically an adult. The district she started kindergarten in had a rule you had to be 5 when the school year started, she turned 18 last month. Jane also believes she is the real victim here and hasn't done much wrong, which has made me question where I've gone wrong raising her.", "created_utc": 1667527967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylm2c2/wibta_if_i_didnt_advocate_for_my_daughter/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being racist about Mary vs being racist about all Indians isn't different - it's still the same racism.\n2. Your daughter is a high school senior. She's on the cusp of being an adult, and needs to own her behavior\n3. It sounds from your description as though Jane is still making excuses. \n\nNTA", "NTA, actions have consequences, and some of them ARE this big. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe", "NTA - If Jane had shown any signs of remorse and an understanding of why her comments were racist and offensive, then I'd say it might be useful to intervene with some caveats, ie that she complete community service/volunteer at Indian charities, organizations, etc and that she publicly apologizes to Mary. But since according to you she pretty much thinks she's been wronged, I firmly believe you should let things take their course and let Jane learn her lesson. Its best she learns it now rather than later.", "NTA. She 100% deserves to deal with the consequences of her actions. Being racist is not at all excusable.", "NTA - As hard as it is for a parent to stand by and not advocate for a child on something this large and life impacting (and I know it is hard for you), you are right. Better for her to face the consequences of her actions now at this early stage of her life and learn a hard lesson than later down the road. The fact that she feels that being mad at one person makes racist comments okay and that she is still making excuses even facing this huge of a consequence shows that she NEEDS to face these consequences and truly learn this lesson.", "NTA-you\u2019re being a good parent by allowing her to experience these consequences. Even you were shocked at the things she was saying.\n\nI think you and your ex (if you have a solid coparenting relationship) really need to talk and discuss how you plan on handling Jane moving forward.\n\nThe fact that Jane thinks SHE is a victim here is the biggest red flag to me\u2014she doesn\u2019t even understand how awful her actions were. Be careful of what media she is consuming and maybe look into some family counseling.", "NTA. I\u2019m floored that a girl who is that intelligent thinks that \u201cI was only saying racist things about Mary\u201d is a valid argument.", "NTA, your daughter is old enough to know better AND to suffer the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. She will learn a valuable lesson. If her college doesn't accept her, there are others that will. This won't completely ruin her future unless she lets it.", "I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. Her future may not be the smooth glide to victory and riches she had assumed, but you reap what you sow.\n\nIf she has to go to a community college instead of Harvard, so be it. \n\nIntelligence and ability don\u2019t make one a good person. She needs to work on herself and her attitude. \n\nYou are obviously trying to be the best parent you can be. Hang in there. NTA", "NTA. She's 18 and old enough to grasp the simple concepts she seems to be ignoring. Nit getting into her preferred school is a consequence. And her future will only be \"ruined\" if she chooses to ruin it. Community College is a thing. There are other colleges.\n\nInfo: if expelled, what plan do you have for her to get her HS diploma?", "Nta\n\nShe needs to know actions have consequences.", "YWNBTA: It's a video. It is definitely going to come up later down the line. If she's not punished now, if it's found out that she avoided consequences for being a racist because her parents had connections, she will be punished later. Rightfully so. Let this one play out. She's a teenager, this isn't going to ruin her life as long as it's handled now", "NTA. There are some actions a parent should not shield their children from the consequences of. Racism is one of them. If she doesn't get into the college she want to go to, well, that is her fault. However, that will not ruin her future. She can have a perfectly good future with a degree from almost any college.", "Nta!  Sometimes good parenting is making kids live with the consequences of their bad decisions. Racism is inexcusable.", "NTA if you let this situation play out. Sounds like a good learning experience for your daughter about consequences of her actions. Hopefully she will actually process this and reconsider her behavior, prejudice and privilege.", "NTA based on your comments about her lack of remorse. Maybe real life consequences will make her rethink her actions.", "NTA - You have to do the right thing as you perceive it.\n\nI, however, remember very well what it is like to be a teenager seething with rage at my personal enemies.It seems to ring true to me that this is about Mary and your daughter is blinded by a personal hatred and sees this situation purely as another battle with Mary and cannot admit fault because she can't give Mary a win.  \n\n\nThe general racist hatred you are trying to grapple with grows from her personal hatred of Mary, She is making that clear.\n\nI would try emphasizing that this is bigger than that if you haven't already. Good luck.", "NTA.  Yikes.  This is complicated. Jane is seventeen.  She is still at an age where she does stupid things.  But at seventeen, she really is old enough to know that certain acts of racism are deeply hurtful.  \n\nAnd her defense, that she was only mocking Mary, not all Indian people, doesn't fly. Racist crap is still racist crap.  And that defense makes me think Jane is not remorseful at all.  \n\nThis is complicated.  On the one hand, there is an imperative to do whatever you can to help your child.  On the other hand ... if you do intervene, Jane is going to learn she can get away with this kind of thing because you will pull strings for her.  \n\nUltimately, I think I come down on the side of you not being the asshole here.  Yes, Jane faces severe consequences.  But I think that if you bail her out with your connections, the consequences for Jane's defelipment as a person will also be severe.  \n\nI was tempted to advocate for some kind of middle path,. where your perhaps broker some kind of academic plea bargain.  But again... that is using your connections to bail her out.  \n\nSo the only middle path I really see for you is to encourage Jane to find ways to make amends for what she has done -- act as an advisor and a parent, but not someone who is willing to bend the rules for her.  \n\nPostscript: My thoughts went in this direction partly because it strikes me that if Jane is accused of harmful racist bullying and you use your connections to reduce her punishment or help her evade consequences, it really sends a terrible message to other kids about white privilege.", "NTA if you didn\u2019t have connections to the board she would be SOL anyway. If she isn\u2019t sorry or willing to learn why her racist comments were wrong, she deserves everything coming to her", "NTA, if my kid ever did anything like that I would welcome any punishment the school saw fit. \nFor your own sake I would make it very clear that you do not condone her behavior to the school and school board. \nThere is no justification for any form of racism. \nPeriod. \nWhile teens can lash out and say some horrible things, racially motivated insults are never excusable and/or \u201ckids being kids\u201d. This is a lesson that the world will teach her in a very severe way. \nIt doesn\u2019t matter how good her grades are if that video gets to college admissions or goes viral for any reason she can kiss college goodbye.\n\nYour best bet is to walk in there and apologize for her actions and have her formally apologize and accept what ever punishment is handed out. \n\nIf she gets to skate on this it will come back and bite your entire family and the school in the a**.", "NTA. Sometimes you have to learn a lesson. Probably more valuable than the degree.", "Wow, this is a complicated one. \n\nI'm going to say NTA, but as your daughter has recently learned actions have consequences and you'll have to be prepared for your own if you don't advocate for her. \n\nBest of luck.", "This is almost a tough one until you get to her lack of remorse. I understand the gravity of these consequences, and know they will follow her for a long time. But she doesn't think she did anything wrong by being racist enough to get expelled from school. It's not like there's a question of whether she did it and how egregious it was. You would have to unfairly leverage your connections to get this verdict overturned, and in doing so you would be teaching your daughter that racism is okay so long as you're powerful and connected enough to have the rules put aside. Using your connections to get her reinstated is a resource most people don't have, and you know she doesn't deserve to have the consequences put aside.\n\nIf your daughter was worried about not getting into college because of her behaviour, she shouldn't have done the behaviour that would get her college admission revoked. There is no question about what she did or what the consequences would be. It's hard to watch her mess up like this, but it would be harder still to raise an entitled racist who thinks decency is merely optional.\n\nNTA.", "YWNBTA, even if Jane was a minor still legally, she knows what she was saying. She chose to be a bigot and to actively mistreat others, you going and fighting that she should still be in that environment to victimize the people she was verbally going after would be you actively supporting her bigotry.\n\nYou are not being a bad mom by wanting her to take consequences, not helping her in her attempt to not only dodge consequences but be back in the same space as the people she victimized, and not one to support the bigotry. \n\nThere should be consequences for her acting like a high school break up is a reason to talk like that, and that no one else should be heard about it cuz she was just trying to specifically attack that other young woman based on her ethnicity, like Jane is absolutely an asshole and I would also be questioning what went wrong because that is something deep within her that she is this self-absorbed", "NTA Your daughter said what she said knowing it would hurt someone. She specifically targeted race because there was nothing else about that girl to target. Typical racist behavior. She's not sorry for what she said only sorry that she's now the victim to her consequences. \n\nIf you bail her out now, it sets an idea of \"I can say whatever I want, say sorry, and its ok\". A very dangerous ideal, not only for her but for the people she's going to target in the future. \n\nAlso, do you really think this would stop at Indians? What if a black woman got a job that she wanted? What if a Mexican woman got something she didnt? Racism is across the board.", "NTA.  Although, you dun fucked up when you raised her...", "ESH\n\nJane needs to see the consequences of her actions, and you're right to not pull any favours to get her out of this.\n\nAt the same time, you and your ex really should have intervened in this rivalry earlier. Between sports, academics and boyfriends there doesn't seem to be many areas where these girls aren't competing and I'm not particularly surprised it went sour.", "Obviously there is no way to condone such behaviour so I guess it all comes down to the level of punishment that you feel is appropriate. She is still young and although this in no way excuses her actions, it does provide the opportunity to correct her attitude. If her future is destroyed I fear it may only serve to increase her resentment? It's  a hard decision in front of you.", "This is a hard one. As a mom of teenagers, I see both sides. I wouldn\u2019t defend the indefensible and racism  is completely a no in my book. However, given the potential damage it can cause, I would go to the meeting and propose a course of action. Say, your daughter will personally apologize to Mary, will take a course in X institute, will serve on X community for a year, you get the point. She needs to be accountable, and do her part to truly understand the gravity of her actions, learn and be a better person because of it. My two cents.\nETA: YWBTA", "I don't think this is as clear cut as NTA / YTA.\n\nOn one hand, she fucked up and having ramifications for that is important to her growth as a person.\n\nOn the other, I genuinely don't believe that something done at this age should have life long consequences, a few exceptions aside.\n\nHow realistic is it, do you think, that she doesn't get into college over this?\n\nThere's also other factors- namely, your personal relationship with her:  fast forward 10 years; she didn't get into college, things went downhill, she's not where she expected to be.  Does she blame herself?  Or does she blame you?\n\n\nI'm not sure what's the right move from a parental perspective.", "YWBTA.  All these people saying she needs to learn: yep. She does. Same as all teens. No one is saying what she did was ok. She should suffer consequences and I think she is. But a mistake at 17 ruins your whole future? Wow. Bet that makes for a happy, well adjusted adult who is a contributing member of society. When kids that age mess up, they need their parents to teach them while protecting them. They do learn from those lessons and that creates well adjusted adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In your daughter's case, the consequences for her are much more significant, than they would be for your other average students. That can make the punishment disproportionate in the circumstances. It's why rigidly applied sentences are generally a bad idea, and restricted to only the most serious offences - discretion is always required to ensure a just outcome. I really should not have to be explaining these things to you - it is *your job* to advocate for your daughter's best interests.

The aim should not be punishment, but acknowledgement, and rehabilitation.

TONS of people who are racist seem to have POC \"friends\" for the sole purpose of being able to go \"iM nOt rAcIsT, i hAvE fRiEnDs wHo aRe (race)\".

POC kids already have to deal with so much and having to become teachers to some girl who isn't gonna listen cause she doesn't think is the problem just puts the burden on these kids to prove their own humanity to someone who isn't gonna absorb anything they're saying. \n\nIt is absolutely not their job, and it is CRUEL to put anyone in that position.", "Well judging by this post, her issues run deeper then just competition. Like she has an obvious hate toward POC, so the fact that a POC is just as good as her in sports, just as smart as her, and literally stole her bf, makes that competitiveness that much stronger. And no matter how many activities she\u2019s involved in outside of school, when she does go to school she has to see Mary, it\u2019s unavoidable. So I don\u2019t think her competitiveness will just disappear because she\u2019s doing an activity outside of school for a few hours. You get what I\u2019m saying?

Surely any student who is expelled from school for openly racist conduct is suffering the same consequences?", "It really does sound like you're defending the very clearly racist daughter. The school didn't fail her, her parents didn't fail her, she failed herself. The school has zero tolerance. It is not a parents job to defend or fight for crap like this. Actions have consequences and this is hers. Accountability and responsibility. What does turning a blind eye teach her? What does it say to Mary and the other minorities? As a parent she can protect her daughter from future mistakes but at a different school. There are some things that are completely unacceptable and this is one of them.", "OP isn\u2019t punishing her daughter. The school is. OP is (correctly) choosing to not make herself an AH, by complaining to the school board that her daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished for her own actions. \n\nIt sounds like OP has reasoned with her daughter and her daughter has chosen to continue to view herself as the victim instead of the bully that she was acting like.

Not EVERY college is going to reject her/rescind the applications. Maybe it won\u2019t be her first choice school, but at some point, she will need to learn that consequences have actions.

The school is partly to blame for the present situation that OP's daughter is in for too rigidly applying its punishment in circumstances that might require discretion. OP's daughter is right to feel that she is being affected differently from how others would be affected in her position. OP's daughter (wrongly) is using this to feel a victim. OP should be helping her daughter realise that she shares the blame for the situation in which she finds herself, teaching her empathy and contrition, and then helping ensure that the rigidly applied punishment is not disproportionate in its consequences for her daughter, as appears will be the case. It's really not that hard to follow. OP is her mother. *It is her job to advocate for her daughter*.", "Oh FFS, we are NOT talking about murder here! You cannot compare situations. And I never suggested there shouldn't be consequences for her daughter. I'm not suggesting that OP's mother should try and ensure her daughter is not punished in any way.

She should no doubt face consequences, but they should be proportionate.", "No, a student with no interest in college is affected differently by that consequence, than a student with good chances of decent college acceptances. The punishment is the same, the consequences of that punishment - the effect of it, is different. It is therefore a high chance of being a disproportionate and unjust response, which is something OP's daughter deserves to have pointed out, and for which it is OP's job to advocate.", "I'm not defending OP's daughter. I'm not saying that there should be zero consequences.

The school is doing that. What OP is doing is not advocating for her daughter to ensure that the school's punishment is not disproportionate because it has been rigidly applied and is leading to consequences which are more severe for her daughter than they would be for other students. She is not doing what she should be in order to ensure that her daughter has learned to accept what she did was wrong and learn empathy, while ensuring her future is best protected.

Where that happens, someone who has been treated that way, deserves to have that position advocated, and that it is the OP's job to do so.  \n\nI'm not saying what the punishment should be - Frankly, we do not have the knowledge of the circumstances sufficient to remotely decide what should happen to OP's daughter - that is for the Board to decide. However, OP's daughter does deserve to have it properly considered by the Board, and it is fanciful to suggest that she could do that for herself.

A punishment is disproportionate if its consequences are applied rigidly in every circumstance without considering the consequences as they apply to each individual in their unique circumstances such that the consequences are of different effect for different people. So, a student who is going to miss out on college positions *because of the punishment* has a more sever consequence on them than on a person who has no interest in going to college.
