My partner\u2019s cousin Ellen (24F) was going to be passing through our town, so we invited her to stop by and see our new apartment and hang out a bit. I like Ellen most of the time.

She will not drop it no matter how hard you try and get her to. If she\u2019s decided she\u2019s in debate mood, your best chance is to leave or ignore her, and even that has mixed results. My partner (and all their relatives) has just learned to live with it over the years (Ellen went vegan when she was a pre-teen) but I haven\u2019t gotten acclimated to it yet and it\u2019s still incredibly annoying and frustrating. I cannot stand willful ignorance and blatant misinfo. Drives me crazy. Especially because I know, work with, and am friends with many people who are vegan or vegetarian, and they aren\u2019t like this. Ellen sometimes seems to me like the walking caricature that gives vegans a bad name.\n\nAnyway, Ellen stops by, and eventually she finds a way to shoehorn veganism into the conversation and starts criticizing us via backhanded comments about using certain animal products,still eating meats, and most relevantly given the time of year, using mouse and rat traps. This spiraled into another series of false points and I hit my breaking point when she tried to convince me that sheering sheep is \u201cvery harmful\u201d and \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d. It was nearing time for me to leave anyway, and my nerves were so frayed, and I was ready to leave, so I said \u201cyou know what?

Ellen doesn\u2019t have my number so she can\u2019t contact me directly, but my partner conveyed to me on Ellen\u2019s behalf that she thinks I was being a total bitch. My partner thinks I was a bit harsh, but agrees with me because they also can\u2019t stand Ellen\u2019s behavior sometimes. Ellen is also already complaining to family members, and my partner\u2019s parents have since called asking about the situation and why I was \u201cso mean to Ellen\u201d.
