Last night my MIL called and said my SIL would not be coming. When I asked why she said that it was bc of our nephew bringing the bf. She\u2019s not blood related to him (it\u2019s on my side of fam) but she has been around him most of his life. I told her that was her choice and ended the convo.

I say good riddance and enjoy your thanksgiving.", "NTA but be veeery vigilant how others handle this. Everyone is about to show their asses for who they really are - take notes to protect your child and warn him if necessary.\n\nForget that lady... she can eat alone with hate in her heart.", "NTA. You are an awesome aunty! That is a hilarious response to call her out on her \"discomfort\".", "NTA and you're amazing for standing up for your nephew! Good on you!", "NTA\n\n\nIt literally doesn't matter how anyone feels about your nephew's sexuality. You are hosting the holiday. You set the guest list. If one guest doesn't want to attend because of another guest, they should stay home.\n\nI understand your MIL wanting to go the peace maker route. Your SIL asked you to uninvite another guest because of her fEeLiNgS about homosexuality. You had every right to throw the ridiculousness right back in her face. Frankly, that SIL didn't realize how idiotic her demands are and decided to tell everyone what you said in an attempt to make you the bad guy shows a serious problem with her.", "No, you are not the asshole. Your SIL is being ridiculous and homophobic. You handled it perfectly.", "Oh. So because *she* wants to be able to eat with the family without being \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, *he* should be kicked out of a family event. And she wants you to be the bad guy and uninvite him to coddle her fee-fees. \n\nNTA and stand your ground!!!", "NTA\n\nShe would be permanently banned from my home.", "NTA!!! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb fuck homophobes- you\u2019re amazing.

Your SIL had no right to try dictating who should be at a dinner in your home. I'd give thanks she won't be there!", "NTA. What would've made her uncomfortable? Two people existing?", "NTA-  you didn\u2019t disinvite her she disinvited herself.  That\u2019s your family and you love them unconditionally and if she can\u2019t deal with it that\u2019s her problem.", "NTA. Way to stand up to homophobia, and help your nephew feel welcomed and loved after coming out!", "NTA. She can clearly keep her bigoted self at home", "Obviously NTA\nI feel like you know that already, but I very much enjoyed your response, so thanks for that", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not 1955\u2026 we live in a world where same sex marriage is legal and mainstream. Beyond that, what is there to be uncomfortable about your nephew\u2019s boyfriend simply being present? It\u2019s not like they are going to be all over each other at a family function. What if he were straight and brought a male friend? This is next level homophobia. \n\nYou are doing the right thing here, even if it\u2019s hard and putting you in a tough spot with MIL. You WOULD be an AH if you uninvited him because your SIL is a bigot. SIL can wake up or find somewhere else to go for thanksgiving. I would try to explain your point of view to MIL to smooth things over but, if she doesn\u2019t get it then it is what it is and I imagine will eventually get over it.", "NTA.... I love the way you handled it!", "Qualified NTA. Of course your newfew may bring his boyfriend, your SIL's issues are her's to deal with. You could have used slightly better language .", "Nta!", "As long as there's a Tucker Carlson marathon on, she'll be fine.", "NTA.  Homophobic aunt can go pound sand", "NTA, indeed I believe you to be an absolute legend! Good on you \ud83d\ude0a", "Exactly - she is invited - if she doesn't show up, that is entirely up to her.", "Nope, that language was fantastic!!\nOP , you are NTA - you are my hero!!", "No, screw that. Because it's right on the mark, direct and to the point; they're not going to be doing anything at the table that wouldn't be acceptable for any other guest of any other orientation, so why shouldn't they be invited? SIL's homophobia is her own problem to deal with, and if it makes her \"uncomfortable\" to not be invited places because of it she's perfectly capable of getting the fuck over herself.", "NTA - absolutely brilliant response \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd29.", "NTA. This is your home and your event. SIL doesn't like another guest then she is free to stay away.", "NTA-\n\nI'm also petty. So I might try to put something matching the comment above Grandma's head. \n\nOf course, my grandmothers would have thought it was funny and approved.", "I\u2019m laughing so hard at that comment my stomach hurts and I have tears in my eyes!!! \nNTA as a queer myself screw homophobes SIL doesn\u2019t NEED to be there", "NTA And everyone can say a little thanks on this blessed holiday not to have to endure her homophobic beliefs in out enlightened year of 2022. She also needs to grow the f* up and get over herself already the world does not revolve around her comfort especially at the expense of someone else who already is marginalized and targeted and just wants to celebrate with family.", "NTA!!  Great response!", "NTA\n\nTell your family that enabling homophobia is lame and that homophobes don't deserve to be treated gently.\n\nYour response was pristine, impeccable and one of those responses that most people only come up with after the conversation occurs and wish that they had said instead.", "NTA\nScrew you SIL and all who support her, you don't need that kind of energy at your house or Thanksgiving. I would question if I wanted to keep contact with her at all. Hope your hubby feels the same. Gross", "She sounds fun! \n\nEnjoy your Thanksgiving. Without her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA... I find what you said hilarious...tell sour puss to suck on a lemon.", "NTA She's uncomfortable with seeing gays existing, eating, having a good time. You're uncomfortable with seeing nasty, closeminded, hateful bigots existing, eating, having a good time. She should understand that sometimes you just don't want to be in the same room as some people", "NTA.\n\nRemind her Santa is watching her homophobic ass.", "You did well, OP! NTA!! We need to start treating ridiculous people who believe such ridiculous things with overt derision and mocking... maybe then they'll get the point lol.", "Hell I lol, almost peed a little. NTA. and yes F homophobes", "\"My husband thinks it's funny\" lmao, yas dude. These stories are so sad when OPs realize their SO is homophobic or just shitty in general, (which is obviously not the case here) so long as y'all are both normal human beings who have similar/same moral compasses then it's always a happy ending. Fuck off with the homophobic family members, y'all can always just shoo them away and it wouldn't be life changing.  Just grateful your honey is on the same page as you, it's a beautiful thing.", "Imagine uninviting a relative because your other relative is homophobic, racist, sexist, etc. How does she think that makes any sense? NTA.", "DO NOT CATER TO :\n\n\\- racists\n\n\\- homophobes\n\n\\- other hateful people\n\nHer not coming is HER CHOICE as she chooses to hate rather than love.\n\nAnyone complaining about this - ask them \"what? Are you one of those anti gay westboro nuts too?\"\n\nNTA", "NTA-", "NTA - no one has words for homophobic sister in law but call her out and suddenly you're the villain. You handled it perfectly, send your MIL the link to this thread.", "NTA\n\nHomophobia can fuck right off it's 2022 not 1822. \n\nBtw your response was hilarious", "NTA. SIL tried to throw her weight around, but overestimated her importance to the function.", "> \u201cwhat do you think, they\u2019ll screw on top of the turkey in front of Grammy?!\u201d\n\nDayumn.\n\nNTA", "NTA but the homophobics are...yuck so nasty", "NTA. Don\u2019t bend to the whims of homophobes.", "NTA. Pretty sure someone here has already said it but I\u2019ll say it too: Fuck the homophobes.", "NTA. I'm old and straight and I don't want to host homophobes. They're just nasty people.", "I mean it IS a valid question and I would say so to anyone who says you could've \"handled it better\". \n\nAlso, as a side note, there is no better way to handle homophobic idiots. Call them out. Good job.", "NTA -She\u2019s a bigot. Gay people exist. She can accept that and leave her house or stay home all the time if she doesn\u2019t like encountering gays. She can also fvck right off.", "NTA and it's a valid question. Why would she impose her beliefs on others over one dinner unless she was worried that it was dinner and a show? She should grow up.", "Let me guess: SIL is a \"christian\", right?\n\nOh, the irony.....there is a holiday with somehow dubious origins, but anyway - it's the one holiday, where \"families reunite and celebrate\", isn't it?\n\nBut, oh, behold, there's a gay around! Sweet lord, he'll lure the kids right into hell!!!!\n\nNTA and frankly, that bigot isn't crying enough.", "Lol. NTA. She I assume us older than nephew. Shes been to enough Thanksgiving.", " Lmao gurl ur slayyy", "NTA - seriously! some 'homophobes' seem to spend their whole time imagining what other people do in bedrooms !!\n\nIt wouldn't be a 'family dinner' if somebody wasn't uncomfortable !  that's the definition of family.  \n\nShe thought you should 'uninvite' somebody to the event and you did.", "She's going to have to stay home for the rest of her life, then.  The world does not exist for her comfort.  We adapt to the world; it doesn't adapt to us. Has she always been so self-centered?", "The comment cemented NTA for me. Already firm but yeah, added cement.\n\nI\u2019m wrapping up in the office just waiting for someone to send an email to respond to and I laughed out loud.", "Also, and it's less important, but while I understand that some people have easier emotion triggers than others, really? Crying over that one comeback that wasn't even really about her? What a baby of a human being.", "Exactly, so tired of people like this trying to act as if this is ok. Also, she uninvited herself. NTA", ">fuck homophobes\n\nNo thank you!! I'd rather sleep alone.", "NTA bigots get no sympathy from me.", "What if they hold hands?? Oh the horror, the horror!! /s\n\nNTA OP, let your pearl clutching SIL stay home"]}
