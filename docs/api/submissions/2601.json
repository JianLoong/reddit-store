I love the way you handled it!", "Qualified NTA. Of course your newfew may bring his boyfriend, your SIL's issues are her's to deal with. You could have used slightly better language .\n\nEdit: There is a reason I said language could be different. People can and do change, all the time. As a person who is closely connected to the LGBT+ community, I want to see this change. How you challenge a person's position will either help them re-examine what they think and believe, or it will cause them to entrench their position, dig in their heels and argue even stronger. The SIL is going to call OP rude and hurtful, and completely dismiss what was said. Perhaps asking \"Why should I prioritize your feelings over nephew's feelings?\" \"You are the one with an issue, why does nephew have to feel bad to fix your issue?\" You keep asking questions. It takes a while, but the end result will be either a person who has changed their position, or you with a reputation as being the clear level headed \"better person\".", "Nta!", "As long as there's a Tucker Carlson marathon on, she'll be fine.", "NTA.

Then it\u2019s a her problem not a him problem and my rule of thumb is unless there\u2019s a valid reason for not wanting to be around someone then the one giving the ultimatum is the one that doesn\u2019t get to join.", "NTA - you'll have a much better dinner without her homophobic views being there.  She can have her own dinner at home... and your MIL can join her there if she's that concerned.\n\nYour house, your rules.\n\nYour husband is right, that comment was funny.  Your SIL can grow up a little.", "NTA have fun with the nephew laughing about SIL", "You didn\u2019t uninvite her, but she\u2019s trying to force you to uninvite your nephew.", "NTA", "NTA shame on her for assuming she has any leg to stand in about being above your nephew. Sucks to be he. Your mil can get over it.", "Your nephew is very lucky to have you and your husband on his side. NTA", "NTA. The married into the family homophobic SIL has no business dictating who is at your Thanksgiving.  Your weren't mean ebough.", "OP=NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to choose your guest list.  About the only way I'd agree to someone having an influence on my guest list is if the \"objectional\" person had done something in the realm of abuse/criminality.  \n\nI realize you put quotes around this, but you definitely did not \"uninvite\" SIL, she has the choice of attending(one hopes with the awareness that she needs to be polite to your nephew and his boyfriend).\n\nPS Love the Grammy/turkey comment.", "I'm late to this party, but NTA.\n\nI just want to add: now that you've been clear about this, your mom, MIL, and sister are likely to seek the same results by other means. \n\nYour nephew needs to be given a heads up because there's a strong chance they are going to corner him separately and try to make him not attend or manipulate him into excluding the BF. They might even blame you. Make sure he knows you want him there, you welcome the BF, and that if anybody says anything otherwise, that he is to let you know.", "NTA. Fuck homophobes. Yay for your reaction.", "NTA. She's choosing not to come. That's 100% on her.", "NTA \n\nYou did not uninvite her. She is choosing not to attend due to her own bigotry. Ask your family why her hateful attitude is more important than supporting Nephew.", "nta", "NTA. If you want to assuage you mom without caving to the crazy....Maybe Apologize to your Mom for letting sil's outrageous attitude get the best of you. In the moment you were just exasperated and matched her levels of being inappropriate. Sil is free to make her own choices, and is welcome as long as she can behave civilly & keep her homophobia to herself; but you will not be uninviting your nephew and his bf. - it was hilarious though, she has it coming.", "Hoping the salt from her tears makes the Turkey extra delicious. Enjoy a homophobe free Thanksgiving!", "Nice response! NTA!", "NTA. Your response was a banger, I love it.", "Nope NTA at all", "Lol \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06. NTA", "NTA \n\nGreat line by the way.", "NTA. I don't know you. But I wish I did you're awesome.", "NTA\nThat comment was funny", "NTA, SIL is homophobic, so she can have her Thanksgiving somewhere else. She doesn't get to dictate who you invite to your house.", "NTA\nWhat is really uncomfortable is to have homophobes around.", "Husband is right- it's funny.  If ppl aren't comfortable, then they don't have to come", "NTA.  She had it coming.  It was incredibly entitled and rude of her to think that you would uninvite your nephew because she might be uncomfortable with him and the BF there.  I'm with you...what the hell did she think they were going to do that would cause her so much discomfort?  I wouldn't want her at my house knowing how prejudiced she is.", "NTA and love your response", "NTA. Her bigotry is solely her problem, and not anyone elses. She can pound sand.", "NTA I would be comfortable sitting at the table with someone I know is homophobic", "I love your response. Made me laugh so hard (so hard my child looked annoyed so thank you for that haha). I never would have thought to say something clever like that, so I\u2019ll take my hat of for you. Btw, you did not uninvite your SIL. She did that herself. And if she is not comfortable she should be in a place where she is. Like in her own home.. all alone. Your nephew deserves a place where he feels comfortable and yours is one of the places he feels comfortable. Your SIL sounds a bit like a pill. She knows your nephew and all of the sudden she can\u2019t bare to be in the same house with him? NTA.", "Absolutely NTA and as a gay kid I wish I had an auntie like you.", "AWESOME!\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA, she made an homophobic assumption and is uncomfortable so then stay your ass home. Why should he be singled out and not invited because she doesnt want the bf there.  I say good riddens good for you for sticking up for whats right its your nephew and you invite who you want.", "NTA. \n\nStanding up to bigotry is always more important than protecting family. This is where the fight against bigotry actually happens....in our real life relationships. Marching in the streets and signing petitions against misogyny, racism, homophobia, classism, etc is one thing but where the lines are really being decided are in our own families, friendships, and professional relationships. \n\nThis is where we force the question with our people - would you rather drop your bigotry or drop this connection?\n\nThank you for fighting the good fight and protecting your nephew from your closed minded sis.", "NTA.  Screw that.  Intolerance shouldn't be accepted, family or not.", "NTA. I hope this is a big wakeup call to your SIL that hating on gay folks (in addition to, and much like, racism) is no longer socially acceptable in modern society. Her discomfort with people who are harmlessly different is her personal issue to fix. \n\nI hope his mom is more upset that her daughter is a bigot than she is of you calling it out.", "Your MIL is upsed because your SIL is upsed, not that your nephew is gay? I would say, than she will calm down eventually. She will still not be happy to be without a part of her family (whichever part that will be) on the Holiday, but will probably survive her disappointment and it doesn't have to escalate further. And I guess at this point you really don't want your nephew to meet this SIL, anyway. NTA", "NTA. Admittedly a bit rough, but her attitude was truly insulting.", "NTA: You should uninvite anyone who\u2019s enabling SIL\u2019s homophobia.", "NTA. SIL can be a bigot in her own home.", "This is the perfect reply to a homophobe. NTA of course!", "NTA  and I love your comment to your SIL. You (and your nephew and his bf) would be welcome at my dinner table anytime.", "I said \u201cwhat do you think, they\u2019ll screw on top of the turkey in front of Grammy?!\u201d\n\nThat was so \ud83d\ude01  funny.\nNTA.   She can stay home", "NTA!!! What decade is she living in?!", "Also, OP didn\u2019t actually uninvite her. She invited everyone, and SIL has the choice whether to come or not. If for whatever (homophobic) reasons, she has an issue with the guest list, then she\u2019s welcome not to come. But she doesn\u2019t get to dictate the guest list at someone else\u2019s home", "This right here! Ask MIL how her talk with SIL went. Because if she's not happy with your comment bluntly calling out a homophobe because they *are*family, she ought to be seething mad about what the homophobe said about her own family for being who they are.\n\nAnd when people tell you that you \"uninvited SIL\", make them say what they really mean. \"She chose not to come because a gay family member was attending with their loved one. Are you letting me know that you, also, would prefer to sit down with a family member who hates another family member based on who they are rather than a family member who loves another person and wants to spend a holiday in their presence with us? Because I need to finalize seating numbers so if you're not coming you can just say that. \"", "Yup. Bigots can eat alone on t-day.\n\nHell, y'kno, most families will even still let the bigot come to diner... as long as they keep a lid on their bigotry.\n\nBut no, this woman just had to force her views on a perfectly innocent family gathering.", "Absolutely banned going forward, too! That\u2019s a real ally", "Yes. SIL (or MIL on SIL\u2019s behalf) pulled a passive-aggressive move; she didn\u2019t ask for the nephew\u2019s boyfriend to be uninvited, she said she wasn\u2019t coming and then hoped OP would rearrange things in her favour. And nope. OP accepted that SIL wasn\u2019t coming, end of matter.\n\nMIL\u2019s approach to the \u201cshe isn\u2019t coming\u201d exchange indicates that MIL also has issues that she isn\u2019t willing to own up to.", "Hahaha I was about to say \u201cfuck the homophobes!\u201d But you make such a great point. NTA op!", "At this point, I would rescind her invitation. Sounds like if she\u2019s willing to cry about OP\u2019s comment, she might also show up and act spiteful towards nephew and his bf, and they don\u2019t deserve that crap from some homophobic jerk. I bet she calls herself a Christian too.", "\u201cDon\u2019t threaten me with a good time!\u201d", "Apparently for that example, even keeping quiet for a half day is too much.  \nHow can one live with so much hate.. boggles the mind.", "It also makes more gays \ud83d\ude0f", "Not if you keep it on a butt-to-butt basis\n\nThat way we are just unlocking their closets"]}
