I love the way you handled it!", "Qualified NTA. Of course your newfew may bring his boyfriend, your SIL's issues are her's to deal with. You could have used slightly better language .\n\nEdit: There is a reason I said language could be different. People can and do change, all the time. As a person who is closely connected to the LGBT+ community, I want to see this change. How you challenge a person's position will either help them re-examine what they think and believe, or it will cause them to entrench their position, dig in their heels and argue even stronger. The SIL is going to call OP rude and hurtful, and completely dismiss what was said. Perhaps asking \"Why should I prioritize your feelings over nephew's feelings?\" \"You are the one with an issue, why does nephew have to feel bad to fix your issue?\" You keep asking questions. It takes a while, but the end result will be either a person who has changed their position, or you with a reputation as being the clear level headed \"better person\".", "Nta!", "As long as there's a Tucker Carlson marathon on, she'll be fine.", "NTA.

I love this", "Lol I love that meme.", "Yes because it is much more likely for her to have narcissistic traits, instead of bein human, and having emotions....", "She wanted her nephew disinvited so she could be comfortably homophobic and then Started crying when OP said the thing. And then she ran and told every body what happened. \n\nShe may not be a narcissist. But she\u2019s trying to manipulate OP and everyone else to get what she wants.", "NTA Tolerating assholes is how we ended up with the last president.", "NTA as said...fuck the homophobes", "NTA\n\nYou handled it perfectly! I hope your first Thanksgiving goes well and is the first of many! Your nephew is lucky to have you on his side. \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4", "NTA and your comment back, absolutely golden OP!", "NTA, you owned her XD", "NTA - she declined the invitation,  once you decline you don't get to campaign for another guest's exclusion.   I suggest an Etiquette Guide for her Holdiay gift.", "NTA - and your comeback to her was golden!!  Poor woman, to be possibly forced to see the hand holding, or even the peck on the cheek of a forbidden love!  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I guess she doesn't realize everyone else will be much more comfortable without her twitching all day.", "NTA. I snorted when I read what you said to her. Good on ya.", "She's the one making the decision not to come... the audacity of her to ask you to uninvite the nephew... NTA", "NTA and I love your husband thought it funny because they are being ridiculous \nHave a great holiday !!", "Funny comment. \n\nNTA.    If SIL should be able to be with family and not feel uncomfortable, so should your nephew! Yet she wants you to kick him out for her \u201ccomfort\u201d.  Nope.", "And, she ininvited herself.", "hopefully.  hopefully she is seeing that people don't want someone like her around.  Unfortunately, it may drive her closer to her bigot friends."]}
