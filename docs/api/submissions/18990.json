There were about a dozen of us! These were people who worked in the industry and should have known better!!!

My bf at the time and I had already put in our fair share and ended up putting the rest in, including a generous tip to the poor girl. \n\nI learned my lesson.

It is prob different in other countries but the reason many in the US tip this way is that most servers get way below minimum wage (like $2.25 per hr) but they make-up the difference in their tips.

Japan, Australia (changing a bit), switzerland (you can tip, but not mandatory tipping culture), Denmark, New Zealand (they are an outlier though, as with most of the other country examples service staff are paid well). It is almost like tipping culture is irrelevant to whether there are servers or not. Almost like servers came first and then tipping culture developed later. \n\nI think it is a legislative failure, a discriminatory one, that servers are exempt from minimum wages (which should be the minimum needed to throve, not just survive) in most parts of my country. It is also despicable that tips are counted as income and taxed where I am - tips are gifts and should not be taxed; gifts are not taxed where I am. \n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to tip you can\u2019t afford to eat out\u201d oh barf, If you can\u2019t afford to pay your staff a living wage you can\u2019t afford to be in business.

If that\u2019s the social contract you believe in then I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t. \n\nNo, tips are not mandatory. Not in them occurring and not in their amounts. \n\nNo, if service is normal than the person is performing the duties they were hired to do at the hourly wage they agreed to. It is just that their hourly wage should be much higher and prices should be hire to account for it. That said, in fast good chains they found that the price increase was barely noticeable (I think I was reading about McDonalds in Denmark) to achieve decent wages and benefits. \n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to pay more for the services that you enjoy, when that increase would cover the cost of giving servers a thriving wage, then who is the real moocher of the goodwill? \n\nI would prefer costs increasing, some businesses closing, and having no mandatory tipping culture (but people being free to tip when they want to. I\u2019m not anti-tipping, just anti-toxic-tipping-culture). \n\nIn my particular location, which has a weaker tipping culture compared to other areas, servers are paid above minimum wage as the people here just do not work for less so businesses had to raise wages.

So they get at least 12.46 USD/hr with tips on top. Should still be more, but not as bad. \n\nThat\u2019s interesting that there was horrible results in your area.

Too, I\u2019ve seen a few restaurants (not franchise like McDonalds) charge an extra 4% if use debit or credit card because their costs has went up and I wonder if this will affect the servers\u2018 tip.", "FYI, In many restaurants in North American the waiters \u201ctip out\u201d to the kitchen and other staff based on their sales. Meaning they are expected to make at least 10-15% of the bill in tips and have to pay 2-3% of the bill to the hosts, bidders and kitchen staff, from their tips.

So all I can really say is \u201cyikes!\u201d  to that. \n\nLike, in my region it\u2019s illegal to pool tips unless they\u2019re all doing similar work to one another. So like, all the waiters can be pooled together, but it gets iffy when you get into pooling other workers. \n\nIt is illegal for them to have waiters to pay 2-3% of the bill even if they don\u2019t get tipped or tipped little. Only the actual tips can be redistributed, in the permitted pools, not estimates of what a tip \u201cshould\u201d have been. \n\nNow, enforcement is another issue, but there have been some pretty vicious crackdowns where examples were made of.

She didn't pay her fair share and shorted the waiter. She single handedly decided that the entire table shouldn't pay $30 of the tip. You split it evenly and then she broke that social contract. It's absolutely behaviour that should be called out and should damage your trust in her going forward.", "10 people and she was ok with leaving less than a dollar for each person served. No. Just no. As an American I feel my entire being suffer knowing this happened to a server. \n\nNTA", "*\"ha, mine's free I guess\" and hand him the pot without paying for her food or even so much as a tip for the waiter.*   \n\nWTF?!  NTA, she is", "NTA the waiter got a $20 tip on a $220 ticket of 8 people that\u2019s not cool and stiffing your new co workers even less cool", "NTA\n\nInstead of everyone puttin in \u00a330 though they should have just paid for themselves, totaled the person who you were paying for and split that instead\n\nYou gave still gave a tip, you don't have to tip in the UK it's not expected so don't get the fuss over the tip. The waiter wasn't paying for the person who didn't put in money, the bill was covered. I'm not saying don't tip because if you get good service then by all means leave a tip.", "NTA - you're right it wasn't free, it was paid for out of the server's tips. She unilaterally decided something to the detriment of everyone else and was embarrassed after being called out for it", "Honestly my first thought when I read this was what a B\\*tch\n\nNTA", "I love when a restaurant gives you each a separate bill. So much easier.", "Some restaurants have a service charge instead of a tip, too, which is usually 10-15%. If there's a service charge it's an asshole move not to pay it unless the service was truly terrible (I've only once not paid and that was because the restaurant served me pasta that was *still frozen in the middle* and were completely unapologetic about it)", "> most servers get way below minimum wage (like $2.25 per hr) but they make-up the difference in their tips. \n\nAnd if they don't earn enough in tips, their employer is required to give them the difference to make it up to the federal minimum. \n\nNo server is legally going home with 2.25 if someone doesn't tip.", "NTA. At least she was brazen about it so you *could* call it out. Last time I had a big team meal at work (Christmas last year), someone - or maybe two someones - flaked on paying, and I only found out as I checked when we were leaving. Turns out there was no tip because some cheapskate(s) decided it could absorb the costs of their meal. I'm relieved I asked, because I could put down 15% of the bill to cover the tip, but ffs.", "I\u2019m confused by this post. When it got to her, did she count the money everyone else put in?", "NTA OP. I would have done the same.", "I used to have a colleague who would do a similar trick, take the cash saying he would pay by credit card, he would stiff the waitress out of the tip and cover his bill (or almost) and get points on the card too. We all noticed eventually so we would jump in early and cover the bill (inc. tip) by cc before he had a chance to steal the tip.", "NTA she stole money that was given to the waiter. It really is that simple.", "NTA. I worked with a woman who didn't do anything quite as blatant as this, but did try to avoid paying her fair share of every restaurant bill. Hopefully OP's actions will keep her from trying this again, and everyone in the group is now aware of her inclinations and can have their guards up.", "NTA. I'd have immediately called her out and said, \"No, that's not how this works. You need to put your money in for the food you ate, what the rest of us tipped to the waiter is not your business. Or we could just get your check separately if you'd prefer to do it that way?\"", "NTA\u2026.it was not a free meal for your colleague.  First of all, what did she do?  Count all the money that was there in the pot?  She should have automatically put her share in with tip.  It was not a free meal for her because there was extra.  That was the tip.   Colleague was wrong.", "NTA. She stole everybody\u2019s tip money to pay for her meal. It\u2019s disguising behavior.", "This person isn't even a cheapskate, she basically stole from her colleagues then had the nerve to run away crying instead of just paying.", "This is the case in a lot of states in the US too, people just like to leave that fact out. If your tips don\u2019t add up to minimum wage, the restaurant has to pay you the difference. So you get \u2018paid\u2019 $2.50 an hour plus tips but don\u2019t get any tips, the restaurant has to pay you $15 an hour bc that\u2019s the state\u2019s minimum wage.", "Yes! That money was earmarked to tip. Whether you agree with that or not does not give you the right to literally steal from your friends and apply their tip to your bill. Trash.", "I see the two terms as interchangeable.", "Agreed! But some Americans might not be familiar with it is all.", "NTA - she stole from all of you and seemed to have a laugh about it", "NTA.  Either your coworker is immoral or has an intellectual disability of some type.  Bluntness is totally warranted in both of those cases.  *Especially since she is new to the group*.  People you know to be decent always deserve the benefit of the doubt.  She hasn't earned that privilege yet.", "[removed]", "YTA, publicly embarrassing someone over 30 quid is going too far. Yeah, they acted cheap but maybe they had a good reason to. You don't know and you were just an AH to take the moral high ground over 30 quid.", "NTA. She should be mortified. She should have paid for her meal.", "NTA. She should be embarrassed.", "Shouldn\u2019t a \u201cteam night out\u201d been paid for by the company you work for?", "Nta\n\nYou were 100% correct. I know tipping culture is different there, but a 20 on a bill that large is a meh tip.\n\nRegardless she unilaterally decided you all would be paying for her meal.
