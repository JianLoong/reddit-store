Is the thought of being his everything and with him 100% realistic? Is his behaviour pushing you away emotionally? Are you getting to the point that you want to walk out and never coming back because you are drowning in trying to do everything and losing yourself in the process?\n\nThere is no-way you can keep doing this for you both. If the issue is his body doesn't work but there is nothing wrong with him mentally then it's time for a discussion. It's time you were both honest with each other.\n\nYour husband may feel that if you are out of his sight you may never come back and that's understandable.

Most of the time, the patient's doctor will file a report with adult social services over it.

Tell him tough noogies if he has a cow about it; you're supposed to have privacy to pee! Also, tell him he no longer has a choice.  You will be going out to see your family and friends. If he's so debilitated he cannot be left alone,  then it's time for a long term care facility. Or he's perfectly capable of being independent to a degree. Pick one.

You cannot be alone together forever. You need to get out of the house and see other people, and so does he, no matter how unsocial he is. And you both need privacy from each other.\n\nIt is rough and traumatic adjusting to an acquired disability, but your husband is doing it all wrong. He's so twisted up in grief and loss of control that he's turned in on himself and is both lashing out at the world and controlling the only thing he can - you.

Find out what social care options/funds for home independence adaptations you qualify for. Find out whether there's things like adapted cars that he can relearn to drive. Get him mental healthcare to ease the transition from able-bodied to disabled. If he has PTSD or depression, get it addressed.

In the meantime, I\u2019d look into counseling if I were you two since if he doesn\u2019t realize that his requests are too much and over the line, you could also be headed straight to divorce, no matter how much you love him. That happened with a third cousin in my family - her husband became a quadriplegic after falling off a ladder, and after years of this exact type of behavior, she burnt out and divorced him", "Why are you allowing this?

Sounds like he is feeling insecure because of the situation and he is worried about you leaving him. Have you sought therapy for him? \n\nJust to give you an idea of where I\u2019m coming from. I\u2019ve gone through bend stage cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s with family several times. While the spouse took the majority of the care giver responsibilities family members and friends all took turns helping to care for the person but even then at the eventual conclusion to the disease the spouse was usually so burned out and exhausted. Make sure you get time for you too.", "NTA and I'm a bit worried about you and your husband. As a full time caretaker you need some downtime to yourself. No matter how much you love your husband, you need time to spend alone with your friends. And honestly, your husband needs to develop some friends of his own, even if that's people he chats with over the internet. It's not fair to you that you can't even shower in peace!", "NTA! First of all, being a full time caregiver is a hard job. So your husband should understand that you need some break. From a relationship dynamic  perspective, it\u2019s healthy to spend some time apart too. He should have understood that you\u2019re with him all day every day and you need this time just to be with your friends. It\u2019s immature and inconsiderate on his part. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this.", "NTA. If he absolutely NEEDS *someone* then he won\u2019t push you away. He wants *you*. He feels safe around you and that\u2019s not a bad thing.

The hill I would be willing to die on here isn\u2019t the girls night in but my physical, mental and emotional health needs not being met. \n\nYour husband is being extremely manipulative.

He is putting you into a position of being responsible for all his needs whilst having full capacity to make decisions for himself. \n\nYou will burnout if he continues to rely on you the way he currently is. You need a break.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds super controlling and abusive. Isolation from friends and family is a sign of abuse and he\u2019s using his disability to create that for you.

I used to be him.\n\nTry not to judge me too hard yet.\n\nWhen I first got diagnosed with cancer I also had wildy untreated c-ptsd. I did this to someone and I hurt them.

In his mind, if that happens then your friends will convince you to spend less and less time with him.

Don't be suprised to find yourself given the cold shoulder if you have any interactions with a single man if you do get the chance to leave the house without him. \n\nIt appears he is trying to circumvent the discomfort of being anxious by making sure you can never see how much fun you could have without him.

Your husband has been abandoned by his only friends, he's disabled, he's depressed, he's scared he'll lose the only person who cares about him (you) and he's displaying all the symptoms of someone on the brink of a full breakdown.  \n\nLook, I have a brain tumor, it sucks.  But life is better now that the drs have given up.  I feel better, I go places, I can get out.  Your husband has trapped himself as well as you in that apartment.  \n\nAnd you're the only person who can fight for him right now.  He can't.  He doesn't know how because he's always been anti-social, had limited friends & you were the bright social director of y'all's marriage.    I strongly encourage you to contact his therapist, or A therapist if he doesn't have one.  Go see the therapist for you.  And drag him along.    \n\n\nTell him this IS the hill you're going to take a stand on.  Not die on but stand on & you're going to fight FOR him & for yourself.  Is he a VET?  Is he a wounded Vet?  If so there are resources to help y'all both.      Invite the girls over tell them he is insisting on being in the room  ask them for their help, beg them if you have to.  Then do the most girly stuff you can think of.    \n\n\nI have to go my husband is demanding I eat.  See....caretakers.......  \n\n\nmessage me if you wish.    I'm really truly concerned for you both.", "i dont know his level of disability but this situation overall is not acceptable. if he really cannot be left alone for short periods of time then you need other people taking care of him like his parents or other family members. you cannot be expected to be your husbands personal slave just because he needs more help than most people.

It's perfectly understandable to not adjust well - note: understandable is Not the same as excusable.

Talk to him, really frankly, really honestly - don't talk to reddit alone, we aren't actually there. Tell him what makes you uncomfortable, that his behavior Is controlling and Is Not Okay. Tell him that you love him and won't stop loving him due to his injury (so long as it's the truth, that would be a different sort of asshole but hey, it happens, I'm not going to lie and pretend it doesn't). Do not force him to go to therapy, but recommend a grief counselor specializing in recent disabilities, if you can find one - most counselors have some experience in it if you don't. If you're religious, talk to your preacher/priest/rabbi/imam/etc. \n\nNow, if he's always been controlling, if he's made you feel alone or made you feel unworthy of love or ever, god forbid, harmed you in the past, or threatened you - you are allowed to leave.

He sounds incredibly unhappy, isolated and scared. An adult should not need to require the 24/7 presence of a specific individual, to the extent of needing to accompany you to the bathroom.

I'm wondering if they didn't like the way he's acting now and decided not to go down with his sinking ship - which you seem to be trapped in.\n\nIf all this has truly started since he became disabled then he needs therapy (if that's financially feasible), support groups, and to start reclaiming his life outside the house. You need to start setting up boundaries again, and start reclaiming your independence: no more going to the bathroom with him outside the open door; no more being denied the freedom to do something as basic as going to the supermarket provided he's not being put at risk to do so.\n\nAgain, you didn't mention when he became disabled, and that's clearly a big trauma, but he *is* an adult (unless his condition involves a brain injury which has left him [I'm sorry, I'm not sure what the correct way to say this is and I don't mean to offend anyone] with reduced capacity and/or an inability to act/reason as an adult, in which case as his carer you get to make the appropriate decisions as to who will provide his care when you're not available), and he needs to start taking ownership of his own recovery - which in this case seems to be primarily mental.\n\nNTA, but if this is genuinely new behaviour this is beyond reddit's paygrade.

This might be a trauma response if he is newly disabled and trying to frantically exert control during a time where he feels like he has lost control, but that doesn't make it okay.

Find ways to take time for yourself and connect with the people who love you besides your husband  \n2. Get connected to a caregivers support group. Not only will you find other people to get support/give support to, but you'll also get a better sense for \"what's normal\" in your situation  \n3. Put in place boundaries. If your husband insists that he needs more care than what you can provide (e.g. needs to be in the same room with you at all time), engage his medical team to level set what is appropriate. \n\n4. Reach out to your local DV hotline. Have a frank conversation about how he treats you with someone who is really knowledgeable in the ways that abuse manifests. \n\n5.

And then I get to enjoy a partner who is referred and mentally happy when they get home", "As another disabled person who is often housebound, I agree. I encourage my husband to go out and have fun even if it means I have a bit more difficulty. I just plan around it, have dinner early and go to bed early so it doesn't become an issue.

The joy I feel knowing he's having a good time overrides anything else. \n\nI don't see how OP's husband is taking his wife's feelings into consideration even a little here. We might have more needs, But ultimately it's still a balancing act just like any other marriage. If a little bit of inconvenience on my part can give my husband joy, I'm going to do it. And if one partner's needs aren't being met, that's an us problem. \n\nBeing disabled isn't a card I get to play to my advantage. It's an obstacle we both deal with together as a team.", "Yeah this was my thought too. We don\u2019t know anything about how the disability came about but it could have resulted in some trauma or be associated with ongoing health needs that are deteriorating. Not that his behaviour is ok, and he needs to own that and get help but to me this screams of someone who is extremely anxious and is not coping very well with a new found lack of independence/lack of being able to meet his own needs. He might just be straight up abusive but OP hasn\u2019t said anything to imply that he was controlling before disability and this issue does seem to be quite specific to his seemingly quite new disability.\n\nOPs husband desperately needs to get help but OP also needs to remember that her husband\u2019s behaviour is not actually within her control. What is within her control is her behaviour, so she needs to start setting boundaries like \u2018I am going in to the bathroom and I will be closing the door\u2019 And \u2018I need time to myself with my friends to remain well, I will be going out on \u2026.day Which gives you enough time to arrange a secondary carer. If you would like my help arranging a secondary carer then I can call an agency\u2019.\n\nDepending on how severe his needs are will depend on whether OP actually can leave him if he refuses to get anyone else in. If she she really can\u2019t, and he really won\u2019t, then the next boundary that would have to be put in place would ultimately be thinking about leaving or arranging residential care for him sadly. He can pout and \u2018refuse to talk to her\u2019 all he likes but that is his behaviour and shouldn\u2019t change her boundaries. All it does is push OP closer to a place where her boundary is that she can\u2019t continue to be treated like this anymore but hopefully he\u2019ll realise he needs some help, both physically and emotionally.", "This is true, but it sounds like the husband's disability is a relatively recent development. He's suffered some trauma, has some degree of significant disability, and it sounds like he's lost his job and his friends. \n\nHe needs outside help. He needs a lot more support than his wife is going to be able to give him. He needs to develop a completely new life plan. One that fulfills his needs as a person. It can't all be on OP; that's too much for one person. But OP and her husband need to work together to figure this out.\n\nThis is what recovery is. This is what life-changing events do to people.

Also perhaps the patient could do something online for at least some outside interaction? Even games.", "How does he have a leg to stand on (so to speak) to try to go with the silent treatment toward someone he is 100% dependent on? Call his bluff and tell him you need some conversation so you're going out with the girls and you'll be back in a few hours. What's he going to do? The power dynamic here is warped. You need to demonstrate to him through action how lucky he is to have you, make sure he understands that it's not automatic, and if he doesn't treat you better you just might consider other options. Obviously NTA", "Agreed. This needs to be addressed or even some sort of therapy. Hes either intentionally doing this (big red flag) or has some codependency (somewhat understandable).  Even the latter he should understand people need OTHER people for support. He's putting everything on OP to the point he needs to literally be around her 24/7. 24/7 care doesn't mean she's attached at the hip but thats she available for his needs.

I would bounce if my husband pulled that shit and he would be left to deal with his issues himself . Not going to make me feel bad if I need time off or have to have someone else come in.", "It\u2019s totally intentional.", "that\u2019s why i said \u201cusually\u201d and \u201cgenerally\u201d cuz i\u2019m aware sometimes people do suck and will abandon those who need them", "There's nothing more off-putting than a person who thinks the world revolves around them. I know so many people who only ever talk about themselves - they'll start by asking \"how are you?\" and then somehow proceed to steer the conversation to something about themselves every single time. I have \"friends\" (I use this term very loosely) whose family members I can name (every single one of them, because they're always telling me about their family drama) and whose enemies i can name as well, but who wouldn't even know how many siblings I have or what their names are. I realized that these \"friends\" only have friends because they need someone to spill all their drama to, bitch and moan all day long, and it's not shocking that they find themselves having to make new friends every few years because nobody can put up with them.", "Yes she could really be codependant. It sounded like you were saying he is thr codependant one.", "I get that. But someone that needy is gonna have a huge wake up call when confronted by that. He obviously either can't or doesn't feel he can do for himself. If she refuses to do for him, she's endangering an at risk adult. How is that fair to her? Anyone else married to an asshole can just leave anytime. I have a girlfriend who paid off her ex boyfriend to get him out of her life because she was afraid she would lose her nursing license because he dropped the bomb on her that he was autistic when she told.him she was leaving. Paying him off? That was her attorney's recommendation. \n\nShe's locked in a corner and he needs to understand just how close he is to having NOBODY.", "There are *a lot* of people who believe disabled people can\u2019t be abusive. It\u2019s a crock of shit", "She needs solo therapy, though, not couples.  The therapist should help OP determine if there's a point to couples therapy - you do NOT go to therapy with an abuser!", "This. 100% this. He is weaponizing his disability to force OP into isolation. Not good.", "honestly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he acted this way before said accident. and now poor OP is wrapped around his finger out of guilt and sympathy. so abusive", "yep, that was my thought too", "For real. My husband has gone through some shit, but he does have a couple really good friends- all of his other \"friends\" disappeared when he couldn't go out to the bar all the time anymore... \nThe number of friends being zero is generally surprising though I'd agree with that.", "I did, and I agree.  The therapist seemed to be very aware and was VERY hard on him. We went for one more appointment where he was finally held accountable, and then we had to switch therapists because of benefit coverage and affordability.\n\nHe could have afforded it, he just didn\u2019t want the accountability. Our next therapist was a soft spoken pushover and he was so charming from day one. Which just sunk me further into things because that validation that he was doing wrong wasn\u2019t there anymore and I felt \u2018wrong\u2019 again.", "Eugh. I had planned a breakup for a manipulative, narcissist ex of mine and that same night I made the decision and gathered my confidence, we were in a big car accident and he had quite a few injuries.\n\nHe was off work and couldn\u2019t even get out of bed alone and I felt obligated to take care of him. It was the worst thing that could have happened to me, and the best thing for him. That was a terrible, terrible time of my life. Looking back now I have a hard time not being mad at myself for it now that my life is so much more peaceful.", "When certain \"friends\" disappear, I like to consider it a filtering device! Sure lets you know who has your back.", "The second part of your comment is exactly why you should not go to therapy with an abuser. They can manipulate even trained therapists into believing their lies and anything you share in therapy can be weaponized against you later. I\u2019m sorry you went through that."]}
