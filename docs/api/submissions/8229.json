The superior to both of you gave you clear instructions why on earth would you think that you could ignore your boss's instructions? Unless you were really ugly in talking to your coworker, it doesn't make sense that you got written up.", "NTA.  I would look for another job.  You were doing what you were told.  I would have been confused also.  Getting written up for that is bizarre.", "NTA - Your boss tells you not to do something until 2pm, and then writes you up for complying with that?  You need a new job, because your boss should have been much more specific if that rule wasn't meant to apply to everyone.  What's the co-worker's beef with asking the boss and the codirector, anyway?", "NTA, hope you didn't sign the writeup, that's BS", "NTA. Your boss sucks for expecting you to take conflicting orders, that\u2019s BS. If you have conflicting orders, you follow the orders from the higher rank, everyone knows that.", "Leaning towards NTA (although that could depend on how you said you weren't going to do it to your colleague), but your boss is massively. They gave you a clear instruction and when you obeyed it, they wrote you up for following the instruction?! That's twisted. I would request the process is put down in writing and shared with your colleagues so you're not caught in exactly the same situation again.", "NTA. Surprised your boss didn't explain that they gave you direct orders. Don't understand how they can possibly reprimand you for following their orders. A bit confusing. \n\nI encounter a similar situation in my line of work. I am a trainer and have been told by my head of department to not convey certain pieces of information to certain people. One of the other trainers - whenever they've heard me passing this info on to my trainees - always undermines what I say and questions it as they haven't been told the same (despite never asking about said info from the dept head). I always feel like a fool, I understand that may not be their intention but nonetheless it's really frustrating.", "That's total BS . Why didn't your boss said YES THIS WAS MY ORDER ? Something is going ! Normally the boss would say yes I gave her this order , you should come to me . Thanks for following the order", "NTA. If this situation was a life or death emergency where literally no one else was able to do anything, sure, contact the parents. If not, I can't see how you could possibly be the AH in this situation. Even if it were an emergency, it seems like policy would place this on higher-ups in the school.", "NTA. But you need to get your boss to clarify his instructions. Hopefully there was just a misunderstanding. Because, if not, I would be concerned if my boss punished me for doing something they asked me to do. Was it the same boss who told you not to send messages until 2 and who punished you?", "NtA.\n\nI assume the person who ordered you not to message after 2pm is the highest ranking person at your job?\n\nYeah, you follow that person's orders and if there is any conflicting orders they can take it up with that boss instead.\n\nI am pretty sure that boss would like to know you been given an order that directly disobeys them. Im sure that write up will be fixed faster then the time you needed to write that post.", "NTA but next time make sure you get new procedures in writing (like a team email so everyone\u2019s on the same page.)\n\nGet everything in writing. That way you\u2019re covered.", "INFO\n\nWhat was the nature of the information your coworker asked to be sent?\n\nWas your bosses request of you a redirect because you were messaging to much, or with improper timing during the actual school day?\n\nIt's one thing to say, \"No, I won't send a general reminder about bringing the green folder\" vs.  \"No, I'm not sending a message with information the parent actually needs ASAP\".", "NTA. This workplace sounds like an *Ultimate Ninja Warrior* style obstacle course of conflicting directives. Truly a \u201cDamned if you do. Damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. \n\nAlso - is being written up a thing in other jobs? I\u2019ve never experienced this.", "NTA, that's totally unreasonable by your boss.\n\nNext time clarify, ask your boss what to do if a co-worker with seniority asks you to send a message.", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of a prick boss does that? Tells you what to do, then when you do what you're told, writes you up for not doing the opposite of what you were told.. I would have just asked right there \"who do you want me to listen to? Boss or coworker? I can't do both when you tell me opposite things\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a hunch there\u2019s some reason that applies here. Did they want you to spend more time with the kids than with the computer? We\u2019re you doing too much of it? What\u2019s behind it. Because maybe they meant do all the picture sharing and non-urgent stuff after 2 but still write parents if there is something time sensitive. I feel like there is something  missing in your story.", "NTA. Im the boss and if I gave one of my employees direction and another employee below me gave conflicting direction, I would expect my employee to listen to me. It\u2019s ridiculous to get a warning for following direction from the boss.", "It\u2019s a not technically a written write up. It\u2019s basically a verbal warning aka \u201ca meeting to talk about what you need to improve on\u201d", "I always reply kindly but the person who complained has been there for over 20\nyears vs my 7. She tends to get annoyed with many coworkers so I tend to try to speak to her kindly at all times.", "They want me to focus more on the kids instead of always having to message the parents but this is a new thing so I\u2019m wondering if they have informed others of it as well.", "Also BS", "I suggest you get whatever instructions your boss gives you at the meeting in writing. So if you later listen to your colleague, you have proof that you were instructed to do so.", "If it's well known she gets annoyed with everyone and complains then I'm even more surprised you boss wrote you up. That's a really sh*tty thing of him to do."]}
