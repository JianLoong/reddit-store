The superior to both of you gave you clear instructions why on earth would you think that you could ignore your boss's instructions? Unless you were really ugly in talking to your coworker, it doesn't make sense that you got written up.", "NTA.  I would look for another job.  You were doing what you were told.  I would have been confused also.  Getting written up for that is bizarre.", "NTA - Your boss tells you not to do something until 2pm, and then writes you up for complying with that?  You need a new job, because your boss should have been much more specific if that rule wasn't meant to apply to everyone.  What's the co-worker's beef with asking the boss and the codirector, anyway?", "NTA, hope you didn't sign the writeup, that's BS", "NTA. Your boss sucks for expecting you to take conflicting orders, that\u2019s BS. If you have conflicting orders, you follow the orders from the higher rank, everyone knows that.", "Leaning towards NTA (although that could depend on how you said you weren't going to do it to your colleague), but your boss is massively. They gave you a clear instruction and when you obeyed it, they wrote you up for following the instruction?! That's twisted. I would request the process is put down in writing and shared with your colleagues so you're not caught in exactly the same situation again.", "[deleted]", "That's total BS . Why didn't your boss said YES THIS WAS MY ORDER ? Something is going ! Normally the boss would say yes I gave her this order , you should come to me . Thanks for following the order", "NTA. If this situation was a life or death emergency where literally no one else was able to do anything, sure, contact the parents. If not, I can't see how you could possibly be the AH in this situation. Even if it were an emergency, it seems like policy would place this on higher-ups in the school.", "NTA. But you need to get your boss to clarify his instructions. Hopefully there was just a misunderstanding. Because, if not, I would be concerned if my boss punished me for doing something they asked me to do. Was it the same boss who told you not to send messages until 2 and who punished you?", "NtA.\n\nI assume the person who ordered you not to message after 2pm is the highest ranking person at your job?\n\nYeah, you follow that person's orders and if there is any conflicting orders they can take it up with that boss instead.\n\nI am pretty sure that boss would like to know you been given an order that directly disobeys them. Im sure that write up will be fixed faster then the time you needed to write that post.", "NTA but next time make sure you get new procedures in writing (like a team email so everyone\u2019s on the same page.)\n\nGet everything in writing. That way you\u2019re covered.", "INFO\n\nWhat was the nature of the information your coworker asked to be sent?\n\nWas your bosses request of you a redirect because you were messaging to much, or with improper timing during the actual school day?\n\nIt's one thing to say, \"No, I won't send a general reminder about bringing the green folder\" vs.  \"No, I'm not sending a message with information the parent actually needs ASAP\".", "NTA. This workplace sounds like an *Ultimate Ninja Warrior* style obstacle course of conflicting directives. Truly a \u201cDamned if you do. Damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. \n\nAlso - is being written up a thing in other jobs? I\u2019ve never experienced this.", "NTA, that's totally unreasonable by your boss.\n\nNext time clarify, ask your boss what to do if a co-worker with seniority asks you to send a message.", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of a prick boss does that? Tells you what to do, then when you do what you're told, writes you up for not doing the opposite of what you were told.. I would have just asked right there \"who do you want me to listen to? Boss or coworker? I can't do both when you tell me opposite things\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a hunch there\u2019s some reason that applies here. Did they want you to spend more time with the kids than with the computer? We\u2019re you doing too much of it? What\u2019s behind it. Because maybe they meant do all the picture sharing and non-urgent stuff after 2 but still write parents if there is something time sensitive. I feel like there is something  missing in your story.", "NTA. Im the boss and if I gave one of my employees direction and another employee below me gave conflicting direction, I would expect my employee to listen to me. It\u2019s ridiculous to get a warning for following direction from the boss.", "It\u2019s a not technically a written write up. It\u2019s basically a verbal warning aka \u201ca meeting to talk about what you need to improve on\u201d", "I always reply kindly but the person who complained has been there for over 20\nyears vs my 7. She tends to get annoyed with many coworkers so I tend to try to speak to her kindly at all times.", "They want me to focus more on the kids instead of always having to message the parents but this is a new thing so I\u2019m wondering if they have informed others of it as well.", "Also BS", "I suggest you get whatever instructions your boss gives you at the meeting in writing. So if you later listen to your colleague, you have proof that you were instructed to do so.", "If it's well known she gets annoyed with everyone and complains then I'm even more surprised you boss wrote you up. That's a really sh*tty thing of him to do.", "I would have laughed in his face", "NTA. Sign nothing and go to the big boss to clarify what they want you to do when getting conflicting  instructions/orders. Any job needs a clear chain of command so issues like this do not occur.", "You need to find a different job. It is not okay to tell you that the directors will contact parents before 2 then tell you to listen to someone else when they tell you to contact parents before that.\n\nIt doesn't matter what they call it, the fact is your boss can't have it both ways. NTA", "If ur boss has a higher manager,  complain to them. File a greivance.  a \u201cwrite up\u201d for following supervisor instructions is a geivable offense In most businesses.", "Clarify with your boss that her orders surpass theirs. Do this in an email so you have proof. NTA", "NTA. But when you get two different orders from mangers. The one in front of you ranks most of the time. But I've had jobs that the top dog. Gave high fives for following his orders. Instead of changing. Now you know how your job works. But make notes about this incase it happens again. CYA", "NTA. Get that shit in writing from everyone. Don't let them do that to you twice.", "You are being given mixed instructions by your superiors. Someone is trying to set you up. Your boss obviously doesn\u2019t love having you around enough to hear you out and provide clarification for you and your coworker. This is just bad management. NTA", "Agreed!! The only exception i could think of is like if a kid had an emergency and boss was MIA", "Be sure to share what the big boss told you and that you hold your coworker. Then let this boss know if there\u2019s still disagreement to please resolve it with the big boss and let you know what the two of them agreed too. If your boss still tells you to do it, go to the big boss. Unfortunately, then you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place and have to look out for yourself.", "NTA. I would start looking for another job. You got written up for doing what you were told.", "NTA. If you like this job, I would respectfully ask to chat with both of them together. You can just say that you want to make sure you\u2019re meeting expectations and ask can we please define what\u2019s expected in situations like this so that you\u2019re clear for next time.", "NTA, your boss does not want you around anymore. Look for a new job.", "Info: unless this was an absolute emergency, then I failed to see in what way they could justify giving you a warning. I think NTA, but unless things change, a new job might be required", "You got put in a double bind. Ask your boss going forward if your coworker's orders supercede hers? It doesn't have to be catty when you ask, but just make sure you get clarity.", "NTA but you need to be getting all these directives from your boss and coworkers IN WRITING. because they clearly can't communicate with each other and are happy to screw you over. oof. good luck OP :/", "Look for another job, getting written up for following the  instructions of your manager I'd wringm", "I\u2019d start looking for another job, and in the meanwhile I\u2019d be asking for everything about my job duties to be presented in writing.", "NTA, but they want you out. Someone has praised your messages, or another coworker (maybe this one) has complained that you\u2019re more popular with the parents, and they\u2019re now jealous. To punish you for doing as you were told is a clear sign they are trying to set you up. I\u2019m sorry, trouble-causing manipulators like your coworker are the ones who get ahead in most workplaces.", "It feels like something is missing here.  Is it possible you misinterpreted the request?  I could see the boss not wanting you to message in general until mid afternoon to make sure you didn't get distracted from other duties but to make exceptions for emergencies.  For example, messaging, \"Your daughter Lina is doing a lot better this week with her homework\" is something that could be left until later but \"Lina forgot her lunch and has no money.  Could you swing by to give her lunch money?\" is reasonable to send right away.\n\nYeah, some bosses are inconsistent AHs but sometimes it's a miscommunication.", "Coworker probably misrepresented the interaction.", "This, I'm almost positive there was misrepresentation.", "OP, do this. Write boss an email saying \u201cHey, I just want to follow up on our meeting the other day. You told me in the future to listen to colleagues when they ask me to something even if someone else has told me not to. Can you confirm it\u2019s ok to disregard previous instructions if this happens again in the future? If not, can you please clarify the proper procedure for when this happens? I really don\u2019t want to make a mistake like this again.\u201d", "\"You told me in the future to listen to colleagues when they ask me to do something even if *you* told me not to.\""]}
