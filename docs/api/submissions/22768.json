I (27M) have 2 sister, an older Jessica (30F) and a younger (26F). Me parents are divorced and my dad is remarried. \n\nWhen I was 16 my parents split due to my mom having an affair with a friend of mines dad. I was at the age where I could decide who to live with. I choose my dad. My sisters choose to shuffle back and forth. Me and my sisters have never been close afterwards. I have not spoken to my mom since I graduated back in 2014 and my sisters have been bitching about it since. My sisters don\u2019t like my step mom while I love her, so they don\u2019t come to my dads much which we are both fine with. I don\u2019t speak to them unless necessary around the Hollidays. \n\nI did not attend my older sisters wedding due to the tension so I\u2019ve never met her husband. I\u2019m currently engaged and our wedding is in December. I planned to invite both my sisters for the sake of my fianc\u00e9 who wanted them there. My younger sister isn\u2019t coming because I did not invite my mom and instead have my step mom involved and I\u2019m happy with that. My older sister pretends to be this big family person on social media so I think for appearances she was going to come. After I sent the invite she called and said it wasn\u2019t right to phase our mom out considering her side of the family will be there. I said I didn\u2019t ask her advice on the guest list. She said in solidarity with our other sister and our mother she isn\u2019t coming. I said great. That was a month ago.  \n\nLast week I got a call from a random number who ended up being my BIL saying he spoke with my sister and she wanted to come. I said that isn\u2019t what she said originally. He said she was trying to force something and that was wrong and she wanted to attend. I said it was too late as the offer had been rescinded. He said that family was important and it would be a good step. I asked who the hell he even was\u2026 as I\u2019ve never even met him. He said my sister is too proud to call so he did it for her. I said it was too bad her ego was that big that she\u2019d allow her husband do her dirty work so there was no invite. I pretty much told the guy that family wasn\u2019t that important given I don\u2019t even know who he is and that his wife tried to  threaten me, so I was done with it. He said a few other things about family and I just laughed at him telling him I don\u2019t even know him, they obviously want a free dinner and he should get his balls back from my sister. My fianc\u00e9 heard most of the convo and said I was being an AH to him, even if my sister was toxic. I told her that the asshole thing is to call on your wife\u2019s behalf about an issue that doesn\u2019t concern you. And to threaten your sibling with shit to get them to do what you want.

You mentioned that she pretends, on social media, to be a big family person. I feel like that\u2019s why she wanted to go - to save face.

Do what you want about your mom and siblings, but you were beyond rude and disrespectful to your bil.

Are you certain you\u2019re mature enough to marry?\n\nEven your partner thinks you were out of bounds. Now you just look ridiculous and kind of sad when this story gets told.", "I'm leaning YTA on this one. There was no need to be so unkind to your BIL, who is a part of your family whether you like it or not. You say you haven't met him because YOU chose not to go to your sister's wedding, so blaming him for being a relative stranger is uncalled for. It sounds like your BIL was trying to offer both you and your sister an \"out\" - trying to resolve the issue peaceably without either of you needing to injure your pride or restart a never-ending argument. Yes, it would feel good to make your sister apologize directly and grovel to be reinvited, but how likely is that to happen, and what does it really help? Your fiancee wants your sister to be there, your sister wants to be there, your BIL is reaching out and trying to be part of the solution... the only reason not to invite her now is out of spite. And is that really the emotion you want to associate with your wedding day?", "YTA.", "ETA it sounds t like you guys need to grow up and get over your mother\u2019s infidelity from over 10 years ago.", "NTA", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9 should defer to you regarding issues with your family (and vice versa).", "NTA. You invited them and they declined. You moved on. It\u2019s none of his business. He shouldn\u2019t have called.", "YTA for going off on your BIL who sounds like he was just trying to mediate things. The rest, NTA. So sad the disarray your mother's choices have visited on her children who are apparently split over which parent they chose to live/side with in the aftermath.", "NTA, because they are both out of line and you wouldn't cave to them.\n\nBIL's homilies about \"family\" are just euphemisms for DO WHAT WE TELL YOU TO DO.", "No, you're not the asshole. She had no right to issue you any tyoe if ultimatum  you called her bluff and when she realized she was on the losing end of that one. She doesn't have the courtesy or the bLls to call you herself. She has her husband, who you have never met before and have zero repor with, call you amd proceed to lecture you on family. I would have laughed, too. It became comical at that point.", "I think ESH.", "NTA for your stance on your sister coming to the wedding. But there was no reason to be a jerk to the bil.

You blame your mom for your parents divorce (I get it, she cheated, but I\u2019m betting you have no idea what the dynamics of the relationship weee). The fact that you still carry such an extreme grudge paints you as vindictive, and, frankly, as having the emotional outlook of a teenager. You need therapy. Probably a lot.", "OP\u2019s mom had an affair with his friend\u2019s dad. I can kind of understand how disgusted he was with his mother. He could have maybe put it in the past if it had been with someone he didn\u2019t know, but a friend\u2019s father?  I think that kind of disgust doesn\u2019t go away, and trying to force OP to forgive his mom is only going to push him away further.\n\n\nSo I think the sister was overstepping when she gave her ultimatum, and thus she was the A H. She basically disinvited herself. Getting her husband involved to get herself re-invited when he never even met OP, was also an A H move.

I can't judge anyone for this, because it's not what you are asking for.\nSince you asked about your wedding, I can only say it's only up to you and your fianc\u00e8 to decide who can or can't come. Your sisters should have just answered yes or no about the invitation, because they already new the outcome on putting your mother in the mix.\nSo they can blame only themself for the consequences.\n\nThe YTA/ESH judgment is about what you have written next. You and your BIL are basically strangers,related only because she is your sister's husband. If I were him, I wouldnt have called someone that I never met or talked to. Being too proud to call doesnt make any sense to me, and makes me think as If he was the one that pressured your sister in changing her mind.\nBut the way you handle the call, was wrong. You could have said a simple and calm: \"Sorry, but this is something between me and my sister. If her pride is more important than calling me herself to resolve the issue, I dont see any point in talking to you\". Then, thanked him for calling and simply hang up.\nBut you chose the aggressive route, taking out your anger with the wrong person. Your feelings could have been valid, but not the words you chose to use. I dont know if it's because you still hold resentment toward your mother and sisters choices during and after the divorce, but I hope that you dont usually react like that when you have problems in your life.\nCut them off if being around them take the worst out of you. Because you risk to destroy your marriage, even before it begins. Your fianc\u00e8 seems to support you, but she can starts to reconsider your relationship, if she only see you being so aggressive.\n\nSo, it's ok to not have your mother and sisters at your wedding, but you need to address all this anger you seems to have inside you.\n\nBest of luck to you and your fianc\u00e8!", "YTA", "Easy NTA,", "NTA you get a call from someone you don't know from Adam telling you Family is important.
