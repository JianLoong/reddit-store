I (27M) have 2 sister, an older Jessica (30F) and a younger (26F). Me parents are divorced and my dad is remarried. \n\nWhen I was 16 my parents split due to my mom having an affair with a friend of mines dad. I was at the age where I could decide who to live with. I choose my dad. My sisters choose to shuffle back and forth. Me and my sisters have never been close afterwards. I have not spoken to my mom since I graduated back in 2014 and my sisters have been bitching about it since. My sisters don\u2019t like my step mom while I love her, so they don\u2019t come to my dads much which we are both fine with. I don\u2019t speak to them unless necessary around the Hollidays. \n\nI did not attend my older sisters wedding due to the tension so I\u2019ve never met her husband. I\u2019m currently engaged and our wedding is in December. I planned to invite both my sisters for the sake of my fianc\u00e9 who wanted them there. My younger sister isn\u2019t coming because I did not invite my mom and instead have my step mom involved and I\u2019m happy with that. My older sister pretends to be this big family person on social media so I think for appearances she was going to come. After I sent the invite she called and said it wasn\u2019t right to phase our mom out considering her side of the family will be there. I said I didn\u2019t ask her advice on the guest list. She said in solidarity with our other sister and our mother she isn\u2019t coming. I said great. That was a month ago.  \n\nLast week I got a call from a random number who ended up being my BIL saying he spoke with my sister and she wanted to come. I said that isn\u2019t what she said originally. He said she was trying to force something and that was wrong and she wanted to attend. I said it was too late as the offer had been rescinded. He said that family was important and it would be a good step. I asked who the hell he even was\u2026 as I\u2019ve never even met him. He said my sister is too proud to call so he did it for her. I said it was too bad her ego was that big that she\u2019d allow her husband do her dirty work so there was no invite. I pretty much told the guy that family wasn\u2019t that important given I don\u2019t even know who he is and that his wife tried to  threaten me, so I was done with it. He said a few other things about family and I just laughed at him telling him I don\u2019t even know him, they obviously want a free dinner and he should get his balls back from my sister. My fianc\u00e9 heard most of the convo and said I was being an AH to him, even if my sister was toxic. I told her that the asshole thing is to call on your wife\u2019s behalf about an issue that doesn\u2019t concern you. And to threaten your sibling with shit to get them to do what you want.

You mentioned that she pretends, on social media, to be a big family person. I feel like that\u2019s why she wanted to go - to save face.

Do what you want about your mom and siblings, but you were beyond rude and disrespectful to your bil.

Are you certain you\u2019re mature enough to marry?\n\nEven your partner thinks you were out of bounds. Now you just look ridiculous and kind of sad when this story gets told.", "I'm leaning YTA on this one. There was no need to be so unkind to your BIL, who is a part of your family whether you like it or not. You say you haven't met him because YOU chose not to go to your sister's wedding, so blaming him for being a relative stranger is uncalled for. It sounds like your BIL was trying to offer both you and your sister an \"out\" - trying to resolve the issue peaceably without either of you needing to injure your pride or restart a never-ending argument. Yes, it would feel good to make your sister apologize directly and grovel to be reinvited, but how likely is that to happen, and what does it really help? Your fiancee wants your sister to be there, your sister wants to be there, your BIL is reaching out and trying to be part of the solution... the only reason not to invite her now is out of spite. And is that really the emotion you want to associate with your wedding day?", "YTA.", "ETA it sounds t like you guys need to grow up and get over your mother\u2019s infidelity from over 10 years ago.", "NTA", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9 should defer to you regarding issues with your family (and vice versa).", "NTA. You invited them and they declined. You moved on. It\u2019s none of his business. He shouldn\u2019t have called.", "YTA for going off on your BIL who sounds like he was just trying to mediate things. The rest, NTA. So sad the disarray your mother's choices have visited on her children who are apparently split over which parent they chose to live/side with in the aftermath.", "NTA, because they are both out of line and you wouldn't cave to them.\n\nBIL's homilies about \"family\" are just euphemisms for DO WHAT WE TELL YOU TO DO.", "No, you're not the asshole. She had no right to issue you any tyoe if ultimatum  you called her bluff and when she realized she was on the losing end of that one. She doesn't have the courtesy or the bLls to call you herself. She has her husband, who you have never met before and have zero repor with, call you amd proceed to lecture you on family. I would have laughed, too. It became comical at that point.", "I think ESH.", "NTA for your stance on your sister coming to the wedding. But there was no reason to be a jerk to the bil.

You blame your mom for your parents divorce (I get it, she cheated, but I\u2019m betting you have no idea what the dynamics of the relationship weee). The fact that you still carry such an extreme grudge paints you as vindictive, and, frankly, as having the emotional outlook of a teenager. You need therapy. Probably a lot.", "OP\u2019s mom had an affair with his friend\u2019s dad. I can kind of understand how disgusted he was with his mother. He could have maybe put it in the past if it had been with someone he didn\u2019t know, but a friend\u2019s father?  I think that kind of disgust doesn\u2019t go away, and trying to force OP to forgive his mom is only going to push him away further.\n\n\nSo I think the sister was overstepping when she gave her ultimatum, and thus she was the A H. She basically disinvited herself. Getting her husband involved to get herself re-invited when he never even met OP, was also an A H move.

I can't judge anyone for this, because it's not what you are asking for.\nSince you asked about your wedding, I can only say it's only up to you and your fianc\u00e8 to decide who can or can't come. Your sisters should have just answered yes or no about the invitation, because they already new the outcome on putting your mother in the mix.\nSo they can blame only themself for the consequences.\n\nThe YTA/ESH judgment is about what you have written next. You and your BIL are basically strangers,related only because she is your sister's husband. If I were him, I wouldnt have called someone that I never met or talked to. Being too proud to call doesnt make any sense to me, and makes me think as If he was the one that pressured your sister in changing her mind.\nBut the way you handle the call, was wrong. You could have said a simple and calm: \"Sorry, but this is something between me and my sister. If her pride is more important than calling me herself to resolve the issue, I dont see any point in talking to you\". Then, thanked him for calling and simply hang up.\nBut you chose the aggressive route, taking out your anger with the wrong person. Your feelings could have been valid, but not the words you chose to use. I dont know if it's because you still hold resentment toward your mother and sisters choices during and after the divorce, but I hope that you dont usually react like that when you have problems in your life.\nCut them off if being around them take the worst out of you. Because you risk to destroy your marriage, even before it begins. Your fianc\u00e8 seems to support you, but she can starts to reconsider your relationship, if she only see you being so aggressive.\n\nSo, it's ok to not have your mother and sisters at your wedding, but you need to address all this anger you seems to have inside you.\n\nBest of luck to you and your fianc\u00e8!", "YTA", "Easy NTA,", "NTA you get a call from someone you don't know from Adam telling you Family is important.

I understand how difficult feelings you had during your youth when your mom cheated on your dad have snowballed into you justifying poor behaviour across time and at present. I sympathize that that was likely a very difficult experience for you and you did the best you could with the knowledge and emotional maturity you had at the time. That being said, you appear to be the thorn in the rose bush at present. There are so many things that need to be re-evaluated with your approach to family. I think first and first most is a greater respect for the difficulties and nuances that family member roles present for people. It may be difficult for you to empathize with the difficulty of being a parent but perhaps consider the difficulty you experience as a son and how challenging you have found it to manage your stressors, triggers, and navigate different situations while maintaining good relations with them. You were 16 when all the drama happened with your mother\u2019s extramarital relations, so despite your behaviour in shutting her out you were effectively raised by your mom for the major parts of your childhood. The way you\u2019re speaking of her is like she played a minor part in your life. The minimal role she plays at present is in large part due to your own actions and decisions, it seems that you believed it best to stay with your dad and didn\u2019t see a reason to stay in touch with your mother in a significant way. This does not allow for a cohesive familial relationship as each child is now set up to take a side, which isn\u2019t your job. You did not need to show loyalty to a parent by shutting out your own mother, that is unfair to you and to her. Her cheating is terrible, but you must separate poor marriages with poor parental relationships, and it appears you conflated these as a child. I think your relationship with your step mother being good is great, but I don\u2019t see why this means your mother had to be benched from the wedding festivities. I cannot fathom not inviting a parent or sibling to such a big milestone event unless something egregious (like abuse) took place. Your sisters\u2019 behaviour, while problematic, is a reflection of your relationship with one another over the years. You may not have asked for input on the guest list but this isn\u2019t some random plus one they\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s your actual mother, and to act like she\u2019s a random variable your sister is trying to give input in is dehumanizing to her. You must first want a better relationship with your sisters and mother in order to see this situation clearer, for now your behaviour appears too angry and you are thinking of this as a zero-sum game.

He invited his sisters, they refused, and BIL's wife tried to use an ultimatum, which is quite annoying.  BIL is acting solely on behalf of his wife - he is not doing, or trying to do any favors for OP.  His lectures on \"family\" were going to fall on deaf ears in such an estranged family,  and he just wouldn't take no for an answer.  I think OP's last remarks were over the top, but I don't think that BIL was being a great guy either.

That put the BIL down a level and on the defensive. The rest of the convo actually sounds like the BIL explaining why he\u2019s the one calling and then another comment about family being important. No need for name calling and belittling. Up until that OP had the moral high ground. Once OP started putting BIL down and being aggressive. They became very much an AH. BIL could post his side of this convo. And say the exact same things happened in the call. Same as OP. But from his perspective. And we would find BIL to be NTAH for the convo.

It's not like OP is getting out of inviting his sister, and he might understandably be concerned that she's going to lecture him if she does come.", "OP sounds exhausting tbh.

If all the genders in this situation were switched, would we be calling OP a \"man-hater\" and that she holds on to an unhealthy amount of anger to her cheating father?\n\nIt needs to be understood that OP was probably way more affected by this than his sisters and his feelings are valid.

BIL didn't call several times, it was ONE phone call that OP entertained.", "That is a very good point. I did understand it from the beginning, but didn't notice that it still felt socially much more normal when the dad cheats. \n\nActually, I know multiple cases where that happened, up to the point where children threw stuff from windows at the dad when he came to grab a few of his things after having been thrown out. In that case, he cheated with a colleague of his, not anybody involved with the kids or the family.\n\nThanks for making me aware of this.", "As many times as it takes. You conclude the phone call.

It's about not jeopardizing the unity of the family and the well-being of the kid for a bit of sexual pleasure.\n\nA cheating spouse clearly demonstrates a lack of care for at least a good part of the kids' well-being. It's got the potential to tear families apart. As demonstrated by OP's situation, where that potential has materialized.\n\nI wouldn't cheat on my wife not just because it would be shitty to her but also because having kids implies making sacrifices to give them the best environment they can grow up in, with two parents by their side doing everything they can to get by and make things work.\n\nI am not on OP's side for I think this is way too vindictive and at some point you have to offer an olive branch, but to pretend that it's just between the two parents is simply wrong.", "It was OP\u2019s friends dad.
