You're wise to expect you're both on the same page regarding financial independence.  As it stands now with him working for his brother and not getting paid in full for his time, should you marry, how could you depend on him to reliably be financially solvent?", "NTA - Financial stress is one of the main factors in break ups and divorce, this whole \u201cgold digger\u201d narrative is just him being a dumb misogynist. Do you really want to marry someone who automatically assumes a woman wanting to be sensible about finances must be a gold digger? Tell him you can\u2019t be a gold digger when he has no gold to begin with.", "I think marriage should be entered into with your heart *and* your head. Many marriages dissolve due to financial issues or because one partner wasn't on the same page regarding financial/career goals. Things get even more complicated when and if you decide to have kids - one parent will probably need to stay home for x amount of time so the other has to be able to carry the financial burden for a while.  Then there are things like home-ownership, vacations and whatever you expect and want out of life. \n\nThere's no point finding out that you're not financially compatible after marriage and going through many years of arguments/disappointment. Using your head doesn't make you a 'gold digger'. NTA", "NTA you want to be sure of financial stability before you commit. This is incredibly sensible and mature.\n\nLots of marriage end due to financial problems causing stress and anxiety, your trying to ensure you don't start off on that road. Good for you OP", "NTA. You are doing EXACTLY what most couples SHOULD do, but didn't. You really need to make sure your goals are aligned.", "NTA - you're communicating what you want from marriage, which should absolutely be done before marriage so both people are on the same page.", "NTA. These are necessary conversations before you take the plunge. And your bf needs to grow up about it.", "NTA but...\n\nWhile this is completely normal, don't set your expectations too high or it may never happen. Obviously you shouldn't get married if you are both unemployed, but you also need to have clear goals in mind that you can reach.", "NTA. You are an adult, he is not. He likes the idea of being a husband (and maybe a father too) but hasn't a clue what that means in terms of effort and dedication. These kind of guys usually bail, or they end up becoming a burden to their wives. If he isn't even willing to talk about it now, what makes you think he'll step up for you and any kids you may have?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you need to have a longer and calm conversation with him, and explain what you have explained here, that your past experiences make you wish for a better future - and that does include him. Explain that you want to be in a good financial situation before marriage so that there is at least some stability, and obviously whatever happens past that point is something that you two will deal with together. You have a mature and collected mindset regarding this, and if he really isn't willing to listen and understand your side, I'd say that's a red flag."]}
