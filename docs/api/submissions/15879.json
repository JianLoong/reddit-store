You're wise to expect you're both on the same page regarding financial independence.  As it stands now with him working for his brother and not getting paid in full for his time, should you marry, how could you depend on him to reliably be financially solvent?", "NTA - Financial stress is one of the main factors in break ups and divorce, this whole \u201cgold digger\u201d narrative is just him being a dumb misogynist. Do you really want to marry someone who automatically assumes a woman wanting to be sensible about finances must be a gold digger? Tell him you can\u2019t be a gold digger when he has no gold to begin with.", "I think marriage should be entered into with your heart *and* your head. Many marriages dissolve due to financial issues or because one partner wasn't on the same page regarding financial/career goals. Things get even more complicated when and if you decide to have kids - one parent will probably need to stay home for x amount of time so the other has to be able to carry the financial burden for a while.  Then there are things like home-ownership, vacations and whatever you expect and want out of life. \n\nThere's no point finding out that you're not financially compatible after marriage and going through many years of arguments/disappointment. Using your head doesn't make you a 'gold digger'. NTA", "NTA you want to be sure of financial stability before you commit. This is incredibly sensible and mature.\n\nLots of marriage end due to financial problems causing stress and anxiety, your trying to ensure you don't start off on that road. Good for you OP", "NTA. You are doing EXACTLY what most couples SHOULD do, but didn't. You really need to make sure your goals are aligned.", "NTA - you're communicating what you want from marriage, which should absolutely be done before marriage so both people are on the same page.", "NTA. These are necessary conversations before you take the plunge. And your bf needs to grow up about it.", "NTA but...\n\nWhile this is completely normal, don't set your expectations too high or it may never happen. Obviously you shouldn't get married if you are both unemployed, but you also need to have clear goals in mind that you can reach.", "NTA. You are an adult, he is not. He likes the idea of being a husband (and maybe a father too) but hasn't a clue what that means in terms of effort and dedication. These kind of guys usually bail, or they end up becoming a burden to their wives.

I think you need to have a longer and calm conversation with him, and explain what you have explained here, that your past experiences make you wish for a better future - and that does include him. Explain that you want to be in a good financial situation before marriage so that there is at least some stability, and obviously whatever happens past that point is something that you two will deal with together. You have a mature and collected mindset regarding this, and if he really isn't willing to listen and understand your side, I'd say that's a red flag.", "NTA. That's not assholing, that's adulting.", "YTA. Money is important there is no doubt about that. However you just told him that you only consider him worth as much as he is paid. He isn't worthy of your commitment unless he earns X amount.  Which I will tell you know, is a problem a lot of men struggle with. That they assign their worth to their paycheck and ability to provide.\n\nIt's not wrong to want your partner to be financially stable, but there is this funny thing called life that likes to screw up even the best laid plans. He can be incredibly stable then one twist of fate and lose everything to medical expenses. \n\nGet rid of this notion of stability, in this current economic world that may never happen. Your requirement should be that he is smart with his money, that he gets paid a fair wage for his work, he makes smart decisions with his expenses and is ready to make hard financial sacrifices for the sake of each other.", "Dude, OP FEELS that he thinks that OR SOMETHING. She has no actual basis for that", "Okay I am disagreeing with you 100%. Why you may ask, basically your post is saying that if they're in love then yeah they should get married even at a young age and even though Opie said that their culture views mid 20s or early twenties as prime time to get married then okay that's fine but she has made it known that she grew up in a family where money has been a struggle and a cause of anxiety. \n\nAnd that is true, no matter where you go in this world there's always a struggle for money or there's a need for something that involves money and yeah you can live life with the money you have but it doesn't mean that you have to go into a big commitment financially unstable. Okay let's take this example, if Opie were to have children and unexpectedly and fortunately she has triplets; but she is stuck for cash and they are barely making enough to support the house then that is not good. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that Opie is not a gold digger nor does she value her boyfriend according to what he makes, she is just trying to look out for a future with him and she also mentioned she wants to go into nursing and she is also worried about her boyfriend trying to get a leg into this economy to make sure he has some money as well. \n\nImagine if Opie does become a nurse and the boyfriend is still not getting paid appropriately, there will be an argument about who works the most and who is getting the most out of the marriage; then if they do have a child it might cause further strain in to the marriage, leading to divorce. Overall I agree with you saying that in this world anything can happen and just like Opie said if they were to get married, they were financially stable before getting married then yeah that's cool but afterwards if the boyfriend unexpectedly lost his job, she said that it is not his fault, it happens.\n\nBefore talking about marriage or even getting into marriage, couples have to sit down and realize their financial stability and know as well as plan for the future whether it is involving buying a house or making plans for their future children or even just deciding a wedding plan. Yes if they love each other then that's great but they are adults and love can not always pay the bills. You mentioned about if the boyfriend is smart and financially conscious then okay that is a good quality but you can be all that and still failing in financials and having less money in life so I would say that Opie is NTA and very smart. I know she loves her boyfriend very much but she also wants to make sure that the future she plans out for herself is not going to be a repeat of what she experience in childhood and though I believe her parents did all they could she still wants to grow better and provide better for not just her but for future children weather with her boyfriend or the next person that Grace her life", "I just want to state that bf is not necessarily a full blown AH. He sounds really immature and like he\u2019s been getting bad advice from friends. \n\nAnd he also sounds like a perfect example of why you don\u2019t marry too young. OP sounds mature enough to handle marriage. The bf, not so much. \n\nHe\u2019s afraid to ask for money he\u2019s owed.\nHe has a job with a family member that he\u2019s afraid to rock the boat with- so financially insecure.\nDoesn\u2019t understand the definition of gold digger.\nHe is probably still heavily influenced by what friends/family say. \n\nHe may grow up by the time OP is ready to get married or he may not. Not holding my breath though", "Due to his defensiveness and insecurities *\u201che took a little offence to this and said that if we were married and he lost his job i would leave him\u201c*. She certainly has basis, especially given the current \u201call women care about is money\u201d narrative being parroted by uninformed men on their boring podcasts."]}
