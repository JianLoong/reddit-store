I think supporting your spouse, even with his own family (ffs why you'd have to do that in the first place), is always the winner.

All you should state is that is what you both want and is what supportive spouses should do for each other.\n\nMore than likely the family's comments come from a place of jealousy. \n\nYou both keep being supportive of each other, enjoy your marriage and don't mind the outside noise.\n\nCongrats on having a wonderful marriage and understanding that happiness is not all about a job one holds or if one brings more money into the marriage.\n\nWish you the best of success and hopefully one day you'll come back and share with us your husband's documentary!!", "NTA. I'd just check in with your husband first. See how he is feeling about everything and make sure it's cool with him if you say something.\n\n  \nMy guess is alongside their money issues, his family has some misogynistic views. They may interpret you standing up for him as him *'not having the balls to say something himself'* or some other bullshit like that. Your husband knows them best, so he'd be able to tell you if saying something would make the situation worse for him. Sorry you two have to deal with such nonsense! I wish you both the best, you sound very happy together.\n\n  \nAlso, \"my husband, bless his soul, is a bad capitalist\" is an excellent line btw", "NTA\n\nBoth you and your husband are truly happy with the arrangement.  **That is the only opinion that matters here.**\n\nHowever, you are right.  You'll never be able to change their sexist ideas.  Put bluntly, they'd be 100% supportive if your genders were flipped.  Particularly if children were involved.\n\nDon't worry about alienating people who so strongly disapprove of your own life choices.  It doesn't matter if they're family or not.  Feel free to tell them off.  But you're better off going NC with the lot of them.  Fighting with them will just strengthen their views.", "Of course YWNBTA! \n\nWith the caveat that you shouldn\u2019t do anything that would make your husband uncomfortable in this situation.

Be loud, be in their faces, and make them all regret ever saying every negative word about your husband. They are all jealous, petty, and inconsequential.", "> is that a lot of his family makes invalidating or snide comments about our arrangement. \n\nINFO: Who are they making these remarks to? Your husband? Both of you when you're together? You alone?\n\nIf they are talking to your husband, then let him handle the situation.  And if he's letting it pass, then you need to do the same. You \"calling them out\" is probably just going to reinforce their sexist view that your husband needs his wife to fight his corner as well as make the money.", "Lolllll I want to", "This is a good point. We should decide together what our messaging is and stick to it.

For these kinda people it\u2019s probably even more emasculating for the woman to defend the man\u2026 gross.
