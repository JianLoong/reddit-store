Your neighbour said she likes someone's kids, and that's why she wants kids, and then your reply you don't like her kids? Who exactly are you talking about?", "ESH. The neighbour didn\u2019t need to go on about her kids and how you like them and say you wanted kids.  That was weird.  You could have been more tactful too and just said you are kid free by choice and don\u2019t plan on having any.  You didn\u2019t need to tell a mom you didn\u2019t like her kids.  You also don\u2019t need to take being kid free your entire personality.", "NTA, but it's not really that hard to get the point across without being quite so factual.

I'm still really really pleased they're yours and not mine, though -- I sure don't want any of my own!\"", "YTA for turning a joke and a friendly gesture into an opportunity to insult the other person. Children are seen by their parents as an extension of them and reflection of their character, especially mothers, who are the ones more permanently changed as a result of the process. Saying you don't like someone's young kids is the same as saying you don't like them personally, so try to keep that bit to yourself in the future and just say you don't want kids if it comes up.", "Well, yeah\n You can explain that you're child free without being rude.", "NTA. That was the lady telling others that her kids are your favourite. How ridiculous and self obsessed. Had she not said that, you would not have been forced to clarify your position. There should *not* be a blanket assumption that everyone wants to breed. That assumption is what is rude. What women do with their bodies should be their own business. Anyone who has an issue with your factual information is the problem, not you.", "Analogy. One thing is to say: \"I prefer dogs company to human company, tbhI am single by choice and happy\" \n\nAnd quite the other thing to say: \u201cI don't like your husband, or anybody else's husband, and I never intend to get married\" \n\nSounds intense and unnecessary and mildly insulting. Children are people too and we are supposed to choose our words while talking about someone's family members. Kids are not noisy cars or screaming furniture.", "NTA because of what she said. You never told her you liked her kids or that you wanted children yourself. She not only assumed but also said something for you without knowing.", "You told someone *you don't like their kids* and now you're asking us if you're an AH?

It\u2019s fine to be child free and not like being around kids.   But to make a blanket statement that you don\u2019t like someone\u2019s kids because you hate all kids is very rude.  Kids are people too.  You were a kid and that kid will be an adult one day.  You can have more tact and say, kids actually aren\u2019t your thing but I\u2019m sure they are great kids.  No reason to announce to the world you hate all children.  Some kids are actually very advanced, intelligent, funny and introspective.", "NTA. I understand that you felt attacked and upset when the neighbor started stating falsehoods about YOU liking her kids better than anyone else\u2019s and that that\u2019s why YOU want kids. Like, what\u2019s wrong with her making up facts to boost her own motherly ego??? In retrospect, you could\u2019ve handled it better so as not to upset everyone, but I understand why you felt justified in correcting her. If someone stated things about myself that aren\u2019t true, f that! I will correct them! Everyone saying that you shouldn\u2019t have stated that you don\u2019t like her kids\u2026 Well, let\u2019s see how those same people would react to someone attacking their own lifestyle choice and making up facts about their own lives! I\u2019m certain that anybody would\u2019ve corrected that AS. \n\nI also think that people believing that YTA, don\u2019t get that childfree people are CONSTANTLY gaslighted by society about their lifestyle choice and want to enforce -through aggressions or micro-aggressions, like in this case- the idea that everybody wants children and that nobody can be truly happy without. What\u2019s more, childfree and single people are constantly characterized in negative terms, which means they are subjected to prejudice and discrimination.\n\nTo put it in different terms, how would these people judging you would\u2019ve reacted if you\u2019d told them that you\u2019re gay, but your neighbor told everybody that you really like her adult son and want to date him? I bet everybody here would tell you that you did well telling her the truth: that you don\u2019t like men because you\u2019re gay and that you don\u2019t like her son for whatever other reasons. \n\nNever be ashamed to speak up for yourself and your lifestyle choices, NEVER! Good for you that you are brave!", "I'm CF and I don't like kids in general like you. For me you are NTA.

Most of the time I just leave it to myself but few things are more annoying than people presuming for me that I want to have kids or that I'll want to have kids some day and from everything I've seen women get it even worse than guys in this regard.

The person literally said parents are always looking for babysitters. That\u2019s a load. The number of people who are extremely selective about the ppl merely being around their kids(less known babysitting) greatly outnumber those who try force their kids on others.", "Yeah it\u2019s really annoying when people write out their entire experience thinking it refutes anything that was said. \u201cOh you had X experience?

If someone is proclaiming something they don't know to be true, why would correcting them in a factual and non emotive manner be offensive? Quite frankly that is absurd. It's bizarre how people seem to *want* to be offended.", "I agree with everything you said, the way you said it. I definitely don\u2019t think your views make you any kind of a bad person. My issue though is how OP directly singled out the neighbors\u2019 children and said she specifically did not like them. \n\nI\u2019m trying to think of analogy but struggling. Think of someone you really care about in your immediate family. Like if someone hates elderly people, and you said \u201cof all elderly people, you love my Nana the best\u201d and they said \u201cno, I don\u2019t like Martha at all, I don\u2019t like Tim\u2019s grandpa, or Jenn\u2019s grandpa Fred either. I don\u2019t like grandparents at all\u201d\n\nThe specific references are what would make that most offensive.\n\nI was thinking about what, if any personal biases I may have. Also about the implications to character of being child-free.  I have kids, but when I was a teen, I hated kids\u2026like really disliked small children. I said I would never have kids. My dad had remarried, and they had two sons together. \n\nI didn\u2019t like the mess, the crying, but mostly I didn\u2019t like the way my stepmom coddled them, all the while stirring the pot and hurting my relationship with my dad (somewhat true, but I was just a teen, going through my own crap)..then I got pregnant and when the motherly instinct kicked in, everything changed. \n\nI have multiple kids now, and am much older. I love children in general, but was not always this way. \n\nI often refer to my attitude toward children when I was a teen as ugly.  Because I remember feeling hate, and I think that hate toward innocents is ugly. \n\nSo, I think it makes perfect sense for someone not to want kids, and understand if they aren\u2019t comfortable handling or interacting with infants. \n\nI think it\u2019s the *hate* part that is concerning. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to hate black people, or gay people\u2026i think even CF people would take issue with people hating the elderly as a people group. What about disabled people?\n\nSo, I think while CF as a lifestyle is perfectly defensible, the underlying attitudes behind it *can* be an issue of poor character\u2026if there is hate involved. I want to think there are acceptable degrees of dislike\u2026.but how is it any different to be racist, or sexist, ableist, or ageist?\n\nI feel I am a better person today, not simply because I have children, but because I catch myself if I start hating any group of people, especially if that group can\u2019t help who they are.\n\nHave you ever thought of it this way? What are your thoughts about all of this?", "Thank you.", "I bet you the neighbour was just joking or being sarcastic.

Growing up I was certain that if I ever had kids, I'd only ever have one. This is something that I've known about myself since I was a preteen. You wouldn't believe how many people at my parents' church and how many of my parents' acquaintances used their own kids and their own parenting as a serious/unironic example of why I should want kids. And it was never the people who actually put effort into raising their kids who acted like that. It was *always* the shitty adults with shitty parenting styles who raised shitty kids and then bragged about how they were such good parents with such incredible kids. Like ma'am, your child is only 'exceptional' in the sense that she may break the record for the youngest person sent to juvenile detention in the history of this state.", "Someone can be \u201cjust joking around\u201d and also their comment can be rude/in poor taste/an overstep, it happens all the time.

Deeply unsettling? That seems like a bit much. The neighbor didn't know OP was child free. And it's very normal to spend time around a child and have that make you want to have your own kids.

Going the extra mile to say she doesn't like the neighbor's is just insulting.", "The thing you say was a lie was almost certainly a joke.  Then OP turned it into major insult.

You are talking about manners yet that mother had none.", ">That\u2019s super rude, totally tactles\n\nSo is saying \"OP likes my children so much, they're the reason she wants children herself\"", "Except if you don't spell it out plain and simple to people like this, you WILL become a free babysit option in their heads bc you may not like them but you DEFINITELY like their kids, right? Right??\n\nIt's OK to burn bridges with people who won't respect you or your boundaries. Unfortunately sucks for the kids but sadly, the consequences of the parent here are paid by the family because the parent is in charge.", "It's okay not to like people even if those people are children, you can't like everyone and that is okay. \n\nThey didn't sound like they where being aggressive, and if the neighbour hadn't of been so delusional and wierd and out right lying then I would agree with you  but given they were acting like that I think a more direct approach was necessary to nip any further weirdness in the bud and put a stop to it\n\nIt doesn't sound like she went out of her way to be an a hole but was having a reasonable response to outlandish behaviour from a parent", "You know what's a good way to burn bridges, lie to all your neighbors about stupid things that don't matter. Like the neighbor did", "No point being delusional just because I gave birth to them haha", "I think that's actually what 67f did. Wrote out her experience of being asked to babysit and then says that's what ALL parents are doing. Other commenters are like um no, we're parents and don't do that.", "I know people who would leave their kids with literally anyone just to get away from them.", "Yh I agree it's annoying when people do that, good job that's not what I did", "I know I know you\u2019re right, I\u2019m just not one for conflict but I have considered this and I know you\u2019re completely correct. I just want to get along with my neighbors and I\u2019m an idiot haha", "Wow you really are dumb. If you can't understand it I'm not gonna explain it to you.", "I disagree quite a bit but I understand your background and why you feel the way you do. I am sorry you went through that. However, there is nothing comparable to disliking children and disliking disabled people. Being a child is a temporary state of being. It\u2019s more comparable to saying \u201cI dislike drunk people.\u201d\n\nI am glad children brought joy to your life. For what it is worth, the reason I choose not to have children is because I couldn\u2019t stomach the guilt of bringing humans into this world. We have destroyed every other native species and are using more than our fair share of the planet and its resources with our existence. It\u2019s not hate, it\u2019s a kindness, it\u2019s a love for other species aside from humans that drives my decision. \n\nDisliking kids is fine too, the same as someone can dislike drunk people. There are particular patterns of behavior that are outside of the control of the drunk person or child that are specific and can be reasonably attributed to an outside force (being drunk, being a child), and will and can change. Further, I\u2019m autistic and sound sensitive. I do not want to hear kids with their lack of volume control (or drunk people for that matter). It hurts my ears and is very distressing for me. None of this is hate, but if I did hate children or drunk people, so what? I\u2019m not suggesting they should be harmed. They should be excluded from *some* areas because adults like me with sensitivities and adults that just want to be around adults should have a right to those spaces within our society. I\u2019m not hanging out at Disneyland or rowdy bars. That said, advocating for adult spaces isn\u2019t advocating for harm of any kind, so why does someone quietly hating kids matter? The kids will grow up, the drunk person sobers up, I\u2019m failing to see how that\u2019s the same as advocating for racist, sexist, or ableist policies. \n\nAs for the OP specifically, it was the mother in this situation who singled out her children. Again, I still probably wouldn\u2019t have said what OP did personally, but OP did say \u201cI dislike all children\u201d to be clear it wasn\u2019t a slight on the mother\u2019s children specifically but she was the one who initially singled them out, not OP.", "The joke was literally sarcasm though.  Which means it\u2019s not supposed to be taken as fact at all, it\u2019s supposed to mean the opposite of what was said.  It\u2019s actually like saying, my kids are so amazing(cough cough) that\u2019s why OP wants children so badly(actually wants to stay childless).  Does anyone know how sarcasm works anymore?!  Being able to decipher sarcasm from real talk is a sign of intelligence.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Same! I only ask, \"makes you want a whole bunch, doesn't it?\" When my kids are at their *worst*. \n\nLike, I had to pause a conversation to referee a toddler slap fight, come back to the conversation and say, \"I bet you really want kids now, eh?\"\n\nThe subtext being, \"no you don't and I understand,\" lol", "if you say dumb sh*t, don't whine if you get a response you don't like. no one has to pick their words carefully just because she's a parent and can't handle the backlash of her words. \n\nyou get what you give. parents are not special", "What the mother said is in no way an equal insult.  It was an innocent assumption almost surely said in jest.  Annoying, sure, but not anywhere close to the insult OP gave.  It\u2019s virtually the same as telling the mother OP hated her personally for raising these hateful children.  Think back to when you were a child.  If you heard an adult say they hated you, how would you feel?  That\u2019s straight up bully behavior.", "Honestly from what OP wrote, it sounded to me like a group of neighbors were joking about their kids and one of them said the dumb thing in an exaggerated joking manner (like *MY dog is better than YOUR dog because she can do ALL the best tricks and she can READ too and EVERYONE loves her and even this person here who has no dogs ALSO loves her and SHE is why they can't wait to get a dog just like mine!* --it's dumb and silly but harmless and no one's taking that seriously), but OP didn't read the room and went straight to *rude* to shut her up. \"Actually I will never have a dog, I hate your dog, and other dogs too.\" Honest, yes, but rude. Being brutally honest is totally OP's right and they can say whatever they want, but they shouldn't expect there to be no fallout from it--ie, the cold shoulder and hurt feelings.\n\nObviously neither of us were there and I'm not the person you were replying to, but that's how I read it.", "Almost all parents will agree what the mother said was a joke. Not something to be taken seriously at all.  Ever heard of sarcasm?", "How is that rude", "So when they ask, \"can you watch my kids?\" You say \"Nope, sorry. Good luck finding someone!\"\n\nI love kids, and I have a bunch of neighbors with kids, and I get along with them just fine. I work with kids professionally. I am almost never asked to babysit. I've done it once or twice in a crisis but I just tell them that I have a super busy schedule (true) and need my down time (also true). They've always been respectful.\n\nI don't know where people live where they constantly have children being hurled at them. A simple \"No, I can't do that\" has always been more than enough.", "I love burning bridges. And I can do it without unnecessarily talking shit about people who aren\u2019t even involved in the conversation. The way you\u2019re approach it you\u2019re making it sound as if they\u2019re this woman\u2019s property that you need to insult and not people.", "So? Who cares?", ">I don't like her children or anyone else's children\n\nNah. This is certainly going out of her way to be unnecessarily mean. Having an iota of tact in a situation like this goes a long way. Saying you are happy being CF is fine. Saying that you are too busy is great. Saying you don't feel comfortable being around and responsible for them is okay.\n\nThe reason why she should try tact is because *she has to live there*. Unless you have real shitty neighbors, it's so easy and so much more beneficial to stay on their good side. \n\nNeighbors can watch her house while she's gone. Neighbors can bring in packages that get delivered in the rain. Neighbors can take the dog out when your car takes a shit on you on the way home. And bad neighbors can totally make it hell to live there.", "Sure, you can dislike anyone! But that being her first line of defense has now permanently damaged her relationship with her neighbors. It's aggressive to say \"I don't like your kids.\" It might be true but it's aggressive.\n\nThe mother sounds like she was making a weird joke and OP went nuclear in her response. Was the mother's joke appropriate? No. This also seems to be the first time she overstepped - a polite but firm brush off is the way to shut it down, not going on the attack. Saying \"I don't like your kids\" is definitely going to be perceived as an attack. Saying, \"ha ha! Still child free, sorry!\" gets the point across without escalating the situation.\n\nOP can be assertive and protect her boundaries. She was not assertive, she was aggressive.", "If they were talking about an adult couple across the street and OP stated she didn\u2019t like them this wouldn\u2019t even be a question. Of course she\u2019s TA. Y\u2019all are only saying NTA *because* it was children and Reddit leans to disliking children", "So laugh it off and go on with your day.", "As a teacher, I wish more parents were like you\ud83e\udd23", "It's completely acceptable state you're child free and will always be, it's even acceptable to say you don't like kids in general...", "Yup. She assumed that everybody wants her to be a babysitter, and that means that everybody wants every child free person to be a babysitter. And that all parents are looking for babysitters all the time. It's a ridiculous assumption and assertion.", "And they're both assholes, and not particularly thoughtful parents.\n\nTheir kids hate them, too. Or will, as soon as they know which way is up.", "No you did not. Just to support your statement, you actually pointed out that the 67-year-old woman above you was being really rude towards parents and was lumping all parents into the same category. It was a ridiculous assertion anyways, since the majority of people have children at some point in time in their lives, and it's absolutely ludicrous to suggest that all of the majority of people on the earth are the same.\n\nEdit: because context can help. Sometimes, I was a single mother to my daughter who is now grown up. And I was one and done because I really didn't enjoy raising children. I don't know how that impacts my opinion, but people oftentimes want to know what side you're coming from so they can figure out if you have inappropriate biases", "Not an idiot at all. Honestly it's so unfortunate you have to consider legal liabilities when trying to be neighborly.", "lol thank you for making yourself obvious.", "Thank you for sharing your point of view\u2026i think you have a very justified reason for disliking the behavior of young children, because of your sensory issues. This makes sense to me. \n\nPart of me is inclined to agree with you, except I would have to think of a different analogy from drunk people, because drunkenness is a choice. It\u2019s a state that adults choose to put themselves in.
