Your neighbour said she likes someone's kids, and that's why she wants kids, and then your reply you don't like her kids? Who exactly are you talking about?", "ESH. The neighbour didn\u2019t need to go on about her kids and how you like them and say you wanted kids.  That was weird.  You could have been more tactful too and just said you are kid free by choice and don\u2019t plan on having any.  You didn\u2019t need to tell a mom you didn\u2019t like her kids.  You also don\u2019t need to take being kid free your entire personality.", "NTA, but it's not really that hard to get the point across without being quite so factual.

I'm still really really pleased they're yours and not mine, though -- I sure don't want any of my own!\"", "YTA for turning a joke and a friendly gesture into an opportunity to insult the other person. Children are seen by their parents as an extension of them and reflection of their character, especially mothers, who are the ones more permanently changed as a result of the process. Saying you don't like someone's young kids is the same as saying you don't like them personally, so try to keep that bit to yourself in the future and just say you don't want kids if it comes up.", "Well, yeah\n You can explain that you're child free without being rude.", "NTA. That was the lady telling others that her kids are your favourite. How ridiculous and self obsessed. Had she not said that, you would not have been forced to clarify your position. There should *not* be a blanket assumption that everyone wants to breed. That assumption is what is rude. What women do with their bodies should be their own business. Anyone who has an issue with your factual information is the problem, not you.", "Analogy. One thing is to say: \"I prefer dogs company to human company, tbhI am single by choice and happy\" \n\nAnd quite the other thing to say: \u201cI don't like your husband, or anybody else's husband, and I never intend to get married\" \n\nSounds intense and unnecessary and mildly insulting. Children are people too and we are supposed to choose our words while talking about someone's family members. Kids are not noisy cars or screaming furniture.", "NTA because of what she said. You never told her you liked her kids or that you wanted children yourself. She not only assumed but also said something for you without knowing.", "You told someone *you don't like their kids* and now you're asking us if you're an AH?

Hey on the bright side you won't ever be asked to babysit.

It\u2019s fine to be child free and not like being around kids.   But to make a blanket statement that you don\u2019t like someone\u2019s kids because you hate all kids is very rude.  Kids are people too.  You were a kid and that kid will be an adult one day.  You can have more tact and say, kids actually aren\u2019t your thing but I\u2019m sure they are great kids.  No reason to announce to the world you hate all children.  Some kids are actually very advanced, intelligent, funny and introspective.", "NTA. I understand that you felt attacked and upset when the neighbor started stating falsehoods about YOU liking her kids better than anyone else\u2019s and that that\u2019s why YOU want kids. Like, what\u2019s wrong with her making up facts to boost her own motherly ego??? In retrospect, you could\u2019ve handled it better so as not to upset everyone, but I understand why you felt justified in correcting her. If someone stated things about myself that aren\u2019t true, f that! I will correct them! Everyone saying that you shouldn\u2019t have stated that you don\u2019t like her kids\u2026 Well, let\u2019s see how those same people would react to someone attacking their own lifestyle choice and making up facts about their own lives! I\u2019m certain that anybody would\u2019ve corrected that AS. \n\nI also think that people believing that YTA, don\u2019t get that childfree people are CONSTANTLY gaslighted by society about their lifestyle choice and want to enforce -through aggressions or micro-aggressions, like in this case- the idea that everybody wants children and that nobody can be truly happy without. What\u2019s more, childfree and single people are constantly characterized in negative terms, which means they are subjected to prejudice and discrimination.\n\nTo put it in different terms, how would these people judging you would\u2019ve reacted if you\u2019d told them that you\u2019re gay, but your neighbor told everybody that you really like her adult son and want to date him? I bet everybody here would tell you that you did well telling her the truth: that you don\u2019t like men because you\u2019re gay and that you don\u2019t like her son for whatever other reasons. \n\nNever be ashamed to speak up for yourself and your lifestyle choices, NEVER! Good for you that you are brave!", "I'm CF and I don't like kids in general like you. For me you are NTA.

Most of the time I just leave it to myself but few things are more annoying than people presuming for me that I want to have kids or that I'll want to have kids some day and from everything I've seen women get it even worse than guys in this regard.

So win win.", "Except that she literally said in her post that the neighbors think she went overboard.", "LOL. Very honest comment.", "Nobody\u2019s experience is everyone\u2019s experience. The person literally said parents are always looking for babysitters. That\u2019s a load. The number of people who are extremely selective about the ppl merely being around their kids(less known babysitting) greatly outnumber those who try force their kids on others.", "Yeah it\u2019s really annoying when people write out their entire experience thinking it refutes anything that was said. \u201cOh you had X experience?

If someone is proclaiming something they don't know to be true, why would correcting them in a factual and non emotive manner be offensive? Quite frankly that is absurd. It's bizarre how people seem to *want* to be offended.", "I agree with everything you said, the way you said it. I definitely don\u2019t think your views make you any kind of a bad person. My issue though is how OP directly singled out the neighbors\u2019 children and said she specifically did not like them. \n\nI\u2019m trying to think of analogy but struggling. Think of someone you really care about in your immediate family. Like if someone hates elderly people, and you said \u201cof all elderly people, you love my Nana the best\u201d and they said \u201cno, I don\u2019t like Martha at all, I don\u2019t like Tim\u2019s grandpa, or Jenn\u2019s grandpa Fred either. I don\u2019t like grandparents at all\u201d\n\nThe specific references are what would make that most offensive.\n\nI was thinking about what, if any personal biases I may have. Also about the implications to character of being child-free.  I have kids, but when I was a teen, I hated kids\u2026like really disliked small children. I said I would never have kids. My dad had remarried, and they had two sons together. \n\nI didn\u2019t like the mess, the crying, but mostly I didn\u2019t like the way my stepmom coddled them, all the while stirring the pot and hurting my relationship with my dad (somewhat true, but I was just a teen, going through my own crap)..then I got pregnant and when the motherly instinct kicked in, everything changed. \n\nI have multiple kids now, and am much older. I love children in general, but was not always this way. \n\nI often refer to my attitude toward children when I was a teen as ugly.  Because I remember feeling hate, and I think that hate toward innocents is ugly. \n\nSo, I think it makes perfect sense for someone not to want kids, and understand if they aren\u2019t comfortable handling or interacting with infants. \n\nI think it\u2019s the *hate* part that is concerning. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to hate black people, or gay people\u2026i think even CF people would take issue with people hating the elderly as a people group. What about disabled people?\n\nSo, I think while CF as a lifestyle is perfectly defensible, the underlying attitudes behind it *can* be an issue of poor character\u2026if there is hate involved. I want to think there are acceptable degrees of dislike\u2026.but how is it any different to be racist, or sexist, ableist, or ageist?\n\nI feel I am a better person today, not simply because I have children, but because I catch myself if I start hating any group of people, especially if that group can\u2019t help who they are.\n\nHave you ever thought of it this way? What are your thoughts about all of this?", "Thank you.", "I bet you the neighbour was just joking or being sarcastic.

Growing up I was certain that if I ever had kids, I'd only ever have one. This is something that I've known about myself since I was a preteen. You wouldn't believe how many people at my parents' church and how many of my parents' acquaintances used their own kids and their own parenting as a serious/unironic example of why I should want kids. And it was never the people who actually put effort into raising their kids who acted like that. It was *always* the shitty adults with shitty parenting styles who raised shitty kids and then bragged about how they were such good parents with such incredible kids.

Deeply unsettling? That seems like a bit much. The neighbor didn't know OP was child free. And it's very normal to spend time around a child and have that make you want to have your own kids.

Like the neighbor did", "No point being delusional just because I gave birth to them haha", "I think that's actually what 67f did.

Other commenters are like um no, we're parents and don't do that.", "I know people who would leave their kids with literally anyone just to get away from them.", "Yh I agree it's annoying when people do that, good job that's not what I did", "I know I know you\u2019re right, I\u2019m just not one for conflict but I have considered this and I know you\u2019re completely correct. I just want to get along with my neighbors and I\u2019m an idiot haha", "Wow you really are dumb. If you can't understand it I'm not gonna explain it to you.", "I disagree quite a bit but I understand your background and why you feel the way you do. I am sorry you went through that. However, there is nothing comparable to disliking children and disliking disabled people. Being a child is a temporary state of being. It\u2019s more comparable to saying \u201cI dislike drunk people.\u201d\n\nI am glad children brought joy to your life. For what it is worth, the reason I choose not to have children is because I couldn\u2019t stomach the guilt of bringing humans into this world. We have destroyed every other native species and are using more than our fair share of the planet and its resources with our existence. It\u2019s not hate, it\u2019s a kindness, it\u2019s a love for other species aside from humans that drives my decision. \n\nDisliking kids is fine too, the same as someone can dislike drunk people. There are particular patterns of behavior that are outside of the control of the drunk person or child that are specific and can be reasonably attributed to an outside force (being drunk, being a child), and will and can change. Further, I\u2019m autistic and sound sensitive. I do not want to hear kids with their lack of volume control (or drunk people for that matter). It hurts my ears and is very distressing for me. None of this is hate, but if I did hate children or drunk people, so what? I\u2019m not suggesting they should be harmed. They should be excluded from *some* areas because adults like me with sensitivities and adults that just want to be around adults should have a right to those spaces within our society. I\u2019m not hanging out at Disneyland or rowdy bars. That said, advocating for adult spaces isn\u2019t advocating for harm of any kind, so why does someone quietly hating kids matter? The kids will grow up, the drunk person sobers up, I\u2019m failing to see how that\u2019s the same as advocating for racist, sexist, or ableist policies. \n\nAs for the OP specifically, it was the mother in this situation who singled out her children. Again, I still probably wouldn\u2019t have said what OP did personally, but OP did say \u201cI dislike all children\u201d to be clear it wasn\u2019t a slight on the mother\u2019s children specifically but she was the one who initially singled them out, not OP.", "The joke was literally sarcasm though.  Which means it\u2019s not supposed to be taken as fact at all, it\u2019s supposed to mean the opposite of what was said.  It\u2019s actually like saying, my kids are so amazing(cough cough) that\u2019s why OP wants children so badly(actually wants to stay childless).  Does anyone know how sarcasm works anymore?!  Being able to decipher sarcasm from real talk is a sign of intelligence.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Same! I only ask, \"makes you want a whole bunch, doesn't it?\" When my kids are at their *worst*. \n\nLike, I had to pause a conversation to referee a toddler slap fight, come back to the conversation and say, \"I bet you really want kids now, eh?\"\n\nThe subtext being, \"no you don't and I understand,\" lol", "if you say dumb sh*t, don't whine if you get a response you don't like. no one has to pick their words carefully just because she's a parent and can't handle the backlash of her words. \n\nyou get what you give. parents are not special", "What the mother said is in no way an equal insult.  It was an innocent assumption almost surely said in jest.  Annoying, sure, but not anywhere close to the insult OP gave.  It\u2019s virtually the same as telling the mother OP hated her personally for raising these hateful children.  Think back to when you were a child.  If you heard an adult say they hated you, how would you feel?  That\u2019s straight up bully behavior.", "Honestly from what OP wrote, it sounded to me like a group of neighbors were joking about their kids and one of them said the dumb thing in an exaggerated joking manner (like *MY dog is better than YOUR dog because she can do ALL the best tricks and she can READ too and EVERYONE loves her and even this person here who has no dogs ALSO loves her and SHE is why they can't wait to get a dog just like mine!* --it's dumb and silly but harmless and no one's taking that seriously), but OP didn't read the room and went straight to *rude* to shut her up. \"Actually I will never have a dog, I hate your dog, and other dogs too.\" Honest, yes, but rude. Being brutally honest is totally OP's right and they can say whatever they want, but they shouldn't expect there to be no fallout from it--ie, the cold shoulder and hurt feelings.\n\nObviously neither of us were there and I'm not the person you were replying to, but that's how I read it.", "Almost all parents will agree what the mother said was a joke. Not something to be taken seriously at all.  Ever heard of sarcasm?", "How is that rude", "So when they ask, \"can you watch my kids?\" You say \"Nope, sorry. Good luck finding someone!\"\n\nI love kids, and I have a bunch of neighbors with kids, and I get along with them just fine. I work with kids professionally. I am almost never asked to babysit. I've done it once or twice in a crisis but I just tell them that I have a super busy schedule (true) and need my down time (also true). They've always been respectful.\n\nI don't know where people live where they constantly have children being hurled at them. A simple \"No, I can't do that\" has always been more than enough.", "I love burning bridges.

Who cares?", ">I don't like her children or anyone else's children\n\nNah. This is certainly going out of her way to be unnecessarily mean. Having an iota of tact in a situation like this goes a long way. Saying you are happy being CF is fine. Saying that you are too busy is great. Saying you don't feel comfortable being around and responsible for them is okay.\n\nThe reason why she should try tact is because *she has to live there*. Unless you have real shitty neighbors, it's so easy and so much more beneficial to stay on their good side. \n\nNeighbors can watch her house while she's gone. Neighbors can bring in packages that get delivered in the rain. Neighbors can take the dog out when your car takes a shit on you on the way home. And bad neighbors can totally make it hell to live there.", "Sure, you can dislike anyone! But that being her first line of defense has now permanently damaged her relationship with her neighbors. It's aggressive to say \"I don't like your kids.\" It might be true but it's aggressive.\n\nThe mother sounds like she was making a weird joke and OP went nuclear in her response. Was the mother's joke appropriate? No. This also seems to be the first time she overstepped - a polite but firm brush off is the way to shut it down, not going on the attack. Saying \"I don't like your kids\" is definitely going to be perceived as an attack. Saying, \"ha ha! Still child free, sorry!\" gets the point across without escalating the situation.\n\nOP can be assertive and protect her boundaries. She was not assertive, she was aggressive.", "If they were talking about an adult couple across the street and OP stated she didn\u2019t like them this wouldn\u2019t even be a question. Of course she\u2019s TA.

She assumed that everybody wants her to be a babysitter, and that means that everybody wants every child free person to be a babysitter. And that all parents are looking for babysitters all the time. It's a ridiculous assumption and assertion.", "And they're both assholes, and not particularly thoughtful parents.\n\nTheir kids hate them, too. Or will, as soon as they know which way is up.", "No you did not. Just to support your statement, you actually pointed out that the 67-year-old woman above you was being really rude towards parents and was lumping all parents into the same category. It was a ridiculous assertion anyways, since the majority of people have children at some point in time in their lives, and it's absolutely ludicrous to suggest that all of the majority of people on the earth are the same.\n\nEdit: because context can help. Sometimes, I was a single mother to my daughter who is now grown up. And I was one and done because I really didn't enjoy raising children. I don't know how that impacts my opinion, but people oftentimes want to know what side you're coming from so they can figure out if you have inappropriate biases", "Not an idiot at all. Honestly it's so unfortunate you have to consider legal liabilities when trying to be neighborly.", "lol thank you for making yourself obvious.", "Thank you for sharing your point of view\u2026i think you have a very justified reason for disliking the behavior of young children, because of your sensory issues. This makes sense to me. \n\nPart of me is inclined to agree with you, except I would have to think of a different analogy from drunk people, because drunkenness is a choice. It\u2019s a state that adults choose to put themselves in.

And people always include their kids in that. I don\u2019t correct it! Reality is, I love my kids and I want only the best for my friends\u2019 kids, even though I don\u2019t necessarily want to spend time with them. Shhhh. Don\u2019t tell anybody I said that!", "Is it rude to say to strangers \"I don't like your kids\"? Are you really asking that? Yes, you're the asshole.\n\nBeing child free doesn't mean also being obnoxious. YTA.", "It takes it from a statement that normal people will understand and not get offended, to a statement that\u2019s personal", "In this context it is totally fine to say that she doesn't like the kids. As the other person was assuming something and taking it a step further by just lying. So all she did was correcting the statement.", "Op is not in the USA unless she is a transplant. We don't say \"mum\" here, and her spelling is not American English.\nETA: they were drinking tea as well, so all that combined would lead me to believe she is in England.", "Looking for this comment! I\u2019m sorry, if you STATE an incorrect fact about myself and I correct you\u2026 if you get your feelings hurt that\u2019s on you?\n\ni don\u2019t care what is being said. If someone says something false about you, uh, please correct them.", "Does no one in this thread understand a joke/sarcasm? The neighbor was messing around.", "And the kids of today will be the doctors and nurses that take care of OP's rude ass when she's old. You don't have to want kids or even like being around them, but they are humans and are quite literally the future.", "OP\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t hurt by what her neighbour said.\n\nSo why is it acceptable to hurt her neighbour\u2019s feelings in retaliation?", "Yep, neighbor was definitely setting up to ask her to babysit, probably in front of the other neighbors so there\u2019d be pressure to say yes. This is just step 1 in the process because they bank on you agreeing with them to be polite and then they think they have you because, \u201cyou just said you love my kids!\u201d \n\nWhen I was a single woman, I was put in that spot more than once. \u201cOh my kids love you, and I can tell you love them too! Can you watch them tonight, they\u2019d be so happy and excited to see you! What do you mean no?!? What kind of single woman doesn\u2019t want to spend time with children?!? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing anything else tonight.\u201d Always in front of a group and said in such a way that I\u2019d look like a jerk. I didn\u2019t actually mind babysitting but refused to be set up that way. All my actual friends -not random acquaintances, parents\u2019 friends, or church ladies- knew they could call in an emergency and I\u2019d be there, but I refused to be pressured into something by someone I barely knew. I discovered in my early 20s that kids with those kinds of parents always behaved horribly, which is why they were always looking for new suckers\u2026 I mean babysitters, and needed adults to watch the kids and not teens. \n\nOP could have been a bit more tactful about it, but at least the neighbor got the message loud and clear and won\u2019t be looking for babysitting from her.", "It doesn't make it not an AH move though. You can be justifiably tired of something and still be an AH in your response. \n\nSimply saying I don't want kids would have been the non AH response.\n\nSaying I don't like your kids is an AH response. It's probably more effective at stopping the nonsense from the neighbors but it's still an AH response.", "Babies have some pretty consistent traits. Do you know any that can change their own diaper? Get their own food?", "That's blatant. What an audacious prick.", ">I have family members that will throw out a random opinions they claim I hold, exactly like OP\u2019s situation\n\nI can't stand nonsense like that. It's so manipulative.  Please turn it around on them next time you catch them doing it.", "Sometimes you have to  nip a situation in the bud or people become annoyingly persistent.", "Seriously, are we going to pretend there is a large contingent of parents out there looking to rope in random hostile neighbors to babysit their kids? This is a scenario that doesn\u2019t exist.", "Same. I have a great relationship with the people in the other apartments. We share laundry quarters, watch each others pets, help carry stuff. It\u2019s nice to know that they can rely on me, and I on them.", "That would be passive aggressive. I would stick to being assertive and simply tell her I have no intention of ever having kids, I prefer my life as is. \n\nTo be fair she was being passive aggressive too seeing as this would be a way to ask for a babysitter. \n\nI'm not really in this basket myself but I have a tendency to be aggressive or assertive seeing as people will walk on you if given the chance depending on the culture. Although I guess being passive aggressive right back actually does lace up the boots real nicely.", "One of my kids is great, other one, not so much. Occasionally a babysitter would complain about him, and I wanted to say, if he was a good kid I could get someone to watch him for free.", "My kids are basically grown and are still assholes \ud83d\ude02", "I currently have a 2 year old who is *very good* at being 2\n\nI don't even want to inflict him on his grandparents, who adore the little terrorist \ud83d\ude02\n\nActually my neighbors would probably love having him over. But they're all older with like 7 kids and 6 million grandkids and great grandkids so they know the score lol. Still wouldn't do it, but that's my own guilt and not their unwillingness talking", "Would it have been an acceptable joke if OP wanted kids but couldn\u2019t have them? No? Is it only okay bc OP doesn\u2019t want kids then?", "My daughter made me a Mother\u2019s Day card with three poop emojis that said \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day from your little shits\u201d. I will keep that forever!", "My daughter gave me a candle that says \"Hope this smells better than all the shit I put you through\"!", "It\u2019s so hard when you just want to have a break to have a bath and cuppa in peace", "Ehhh certain hills to die on and this ain\u2019t one worth it. Just kinda isolates you from the rest the neighborhood once you cross that line. If OP is cool with that then fine but it\u2019s kinda a zero sum game", "Maybe they weren't trying to be aggressive, but kids are something very personal to parents that they often see as extensions of themselves and are proud of. So, to them, it might feel like OP not only doesn't like kids, but *especially* dislikes their kids too. Like OP had to personally add that on top of already stating they don't like kids; like the parents' kids specifically was worth mentioning as a statement to how much they dislike kids.  \n\nIt's like if I poured my heart and soul into an art project that means a lot to me and someone came up to me and said they don't like art or art projects whatsoever. Okay, I would've thought: \"alright, people can like and dislike whatever they want\".   \n\nBut then they go further and add that in addition to disliking art, they specifically don't like *my* art project either. Okay.... was that *really* necessary to add? Like, I understood that you disliked art the first time, you didn't have to go on and single me out and make sure to use my project as an example of how much you don't like art.", "Nothing about this is \"full nuclear\" lol.\n\nSomeone said something mildly unkind to a person who was being profoundly shitty.", "And you were there to hear the tone and detect sarcasm?  Hmm. No?  You weren\u2019t there?  Then you have no idea how it was said but OP does know how it was said. There is no reason to beat around the bush since she told all of them she doesn\u2019t like their kids. \nNTA.", "My boy was also on melatonin at night. My boys are 30 and 31 now so past the worst of it", "It\u2019s ridiculous, and generally untrue.\n\n With the number of parents there are in existence, you\u2019d think there would be hundreds of babysitters in each area, all advertising their services!!  There aren\u2019t. \n\nI have 2 kids, and the only people who have ever looked after my kids are the grandparents, and other people with kids (of roughly the same age). My child-free brother wouldn\u2019t last 2 hours, and my other childless work colleagues aren\u2019t candidates because who wants to leave their kids with people who intentionally don\u2019t want kids??????"]}
