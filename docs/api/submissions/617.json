{"id": 617, "submission_id": "yhb07j", "title": "AITA for giving a kitten to a friend that then infected her cat with a flu?", "selftext": "So I recently came into 3 kittens that were all pretty healthy and about 3 months old. I took them to the vet and the vet told me they were all fine but with a little flu. Vet said it would be no big deal and that they would be okay to be adopted after being dewormed/deflead.\n\nFrom here, my friend, lets call her Jenny, decided that she wanted a new kitten as a buddy for her cat. I assumed that her cat was vaccinated and that there would be no major concerns. I told her about the kittens, but I forgot to mention that they had the flu. Coming to the adoption date, they all looked healthy and I didn't think much of it.\n\nA week later, on the day I was supposed to bring the kittens over, Jenny decided to throw a small get together with 3 other friends there drinking. I was only informed of this at the last minute when I was on the way, otherwise I wouldn't have even gone. I was under the impression it would be a one-to-one session where we could talk about the kittens and discuss their needs thoroughly. To no surprise, as there were strangers and drinking going on (I drank a few beers too), a lot of information was missed out. Kittens looked healthy, but the one Jenny was going to adopt started sneezing a little.\n\nFew hours after Jenny took the kitten, she texted me that he had pooped on the floor (diarrhea) and was pissed about it. She was also pissed that she had to feed him medication and eye drops for his flu. She was throwing all the blame at me, saying that it was a big deal.  I apologized as I should have told her about the flu earlier, but there was so much going on that it slipped by me.\n\nA day later, Jenny returned the kitten to me and was visibly pissed because her own cat had fallen sick. I assumed that since she had the cat for awhile, it would have been vaccinated. I didn't think to ask. A week later, Jenny texted me saying that she was massively pissed and asked me \"what the fuck were you thinking?\" because her cat is now ill.\n\nI never forced her to adopt. I made it very clear that the responsibility and decision to be educated on kittens is hers, not mine. That she should know a kitten isn't all fun and play, but also a ton of work. I've helped numerous kittens get adopted, and I have never had a problem or complaint from anyone. I've apologized and accepted part of the blame, but she seems to be lashing out and blaming me for everything.\n\nI'm devastated. All I wanted was to find a good home for these kitties and now it's turned into such a shitshow.  Am I solely to blame here? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I didn't really forget. It was more like, the kitten had already recovered in the days leading up to the adoption. Only when I brought him out at Jenny's apartment did he start sneezing again. That's when I mentioned he had a bit of a flu and that I was giving him medication as a precaution.

It was absolutely your responsibility to tell your friend that the kitten she was adopting was sick.  However, she is way overreacting. It's the flu.  both the cat and the kitten will get better.", "Oh my this is hard. I'm going with ESH here.\n\nMy reasoning is not only because you didn't tell her about the flu, but you left a kitten with a person that was obviously not preparing properly for it.\n\nShe invited guests to a party the day she planned to get a kitten. Had it been me, I'd turned right around and left *with* the kitten!

If an animal is sick you need to let the potential adopter know. If she had known, she could have quarantined the kitten, gotten him treatment sooner, and gotten her other cat vaccinated. Heck she could have backed out all together and saved some time and energy. Now she will have to deal with a vet bill double the size. Even if they are a little sick or recovering you still need to let them know cause you are withholding information", "ESH, you for forgetting to bring it up, and her for not asking for the health status of the kitten etc. When you take on a pet, you have to find out what food it's on, vaccinations, does it need chipping, so you have a clear picture for an easier transition and a plan to get everything outstanding done.", "ESH. Forgetting to tell Jenny that the kitten was sick sounds pretty careless. However, Jenny continuing to complain after a whole week was a bit over-the-top. She should get her cat vaccinated for common diseases.", "ESH, being vaccinated doesn't mean total/lifelong immunity. I think the friend made a mistake. New kittens are commonly isolated first when getting adopted to avoid circumstances such as this.", "YTA, next time you find stray animals, bring them to a rescue. They would require proof of vaccination of existing pets, automatically provide full written and verbal disclosure of the kitten's illness with medication and instructions. They would require that contracts with this information be signed.

But if you didn't tell him about the flu, how did she suddenly know about the medication? Also did you give her the medication/tell her about his illness when you went over the kitten's needs, because that seems especially irresponsible if you gave her the kitten without telling her something really important...\n\n>was also pissed that she had to feed him medication and eye drops for his flu.", "ESH -- if you noticed the kitten was sneezing, you should have passed that info on. Sneezing can mean a lot of different things, including some that cannot be vaccinated against (like feline herpes). But she also should have quarantined the kitten and kept it separated from her cat for a while, too (and I say this as someone who fosters kittens and has adult cats). Just plopping a kitten in with adult cats, even fully vaccinated adult cats, can lead to all kinds of infections and illnesses making their way around. It's not a great move. And she should have taken the kitten to the vet first thing. You do that with any new pet -- to ensure it's altered, to get any necessary remaining shots, to get worming/flea meds, and to get its chip. You also want to establish vet care! \n\nHonestly, though, bullet dodged -- who gets angry with a kitten for having an accident? That's bonkers.\n\nedit: Added thoughts.", "ESH", "Info, is it the flu or herpes? You mentioned sneezing and eye drops. I haven't heard of the flu being that prominent in cats, but I've heard a lot of them having herpes.", "ESH but huge red flag she got mad a kitten pooped on her floor, its a baby", "Your friend sucks and shouldn\u2019t have a kitten. The two cats should not have even been near each other for at least 5 days. \nVet your future adopters better. \nNTA", "ESH, especially because she has another cat. If it's an old cat, even the simplest things can cause serious problems. You should have made sure she was well-informed and she should have explicitly asked about the kitten's health.\n\n(Also is this post from US? Is flu vaccination for pets a common thing there? There's no such thing where I live, so just a bit confused about the the post assuming her cat was vaccinated and the comments saying it should have been.)", "I mean I get it, and I've accepted and apologized for my part. I didn't purposely omit the information in bad faith. \n\nOn the days leading up to the adoption, the kitten was very active and I thought the flu had already passed. I'm not sure if the high-stress situation of multiple people around had caused it to flare up again after he was adopted. \n\nEvery kitten I've ever rescued has had the flu, and it's been common knowledge amongst everyone I've met.  I didn't think I'd need to spell it out for someone else that kittens do get ill, especially when they're too young to be vaccinated. \n\nThe kitten has been back with me for almost a week. He's doing very well and is very playful.", "I don't think you even read the post.", "Thanks. If nothing else this really was a lesson to me. I'm usually very thorough with the people who adopt from me and I go to great lengths to vet them. In this case, I let my guard down because it was a friend who I know has a cat, so I didn't think I'd need to spell out every single detail.\n\nI did let her know regarding food, vaccinations, and medications. In fact I told her the kitten was healthy and he was in very good health leading up to the adoption date. I'm not sure if the situation of having multiple new people around caused the flu to flare up again.", "I didn't really forget. It was more like, he had already recovered in the days leading up to the adoption. Only when I brought him out at Jenny's apartment did he start sneezing again. That's when I mentioned he had a bit of a flu and that I was giving him medication as a precaution.\n\nIdk man, I'm pretty stressed out about this. I'm just afraid if it gets serious and her cat ends up with a ton of complications.", "I added this to the post:\n\n>It was more like, the kitten had already recovered in the days leading up to the adoption. Only when I brought him out at Jenny's apartment did he start sneezing again. That's when I mentioned he had a bit of a flu and that I was giving him medication as a precaution. Not sure if multiple new people and a new place caused the symptoms to flare up again.\n\nI can't take them to a rescue because they're overloaded here. I do my part by TNVR-ing loads of strays. In this case since they're kittens, there's a better chance someone will adopt them.\n\nIt is absolutely someone else's responsibility to inform themselves about the needs of a living creature before deciding to adopt. I'm not saying that she should know the kitten was sick, that was my fault. But she should have known that kittens do get sick, and I'd made it clear they're too young to vaccinate. If she hadn't vaccinated her cat yet, that is not my fault. Most people vaccinate their cats as soon as they're old enough.\n\nI accepted the blame on my part, where there was some negligence, but I work a full-time job, have a side-job, manage a HOA, and then people dump animals on me. Sometimes mistakes happen in all the chaos that is my life, and I own up to it. But in this case  I feel like I'm being attacked when there is blame on both sides, but the other person only wants to pile it all on me.", "So I've added this edit to the post that addresses this:\n\n>I didn't really forget.

That's when I mentioned he had a bit of a flu and that I was giving him medication as a precaution.

I didn't get a chance to bring it up until later in the day because of the little drinking session she organized.", "I don\u2019t understand this, as someone who\u2019s fostered kittens for three years. If you have are typical \u201cthorough,\u201d how does it not include handing over the kitten\u2019s health records? It is so important to document all the meds, vaccinations, and spay/neuter. Why didn\u2019t this go to the adopter so they absolutely knew about the virus. \n\nAnd yes kittens often have viruses\u2014tons and tons of them. Was this feline herpes? Was it an upper respiratory infection? Parvo? Only a few viruses have vaccinations, so it is completely ignorant to \u201cassume\u201d her cat was vaccinated from this one particular virus and vaccinations don\u2019t always prevent the disease, but rather lessen the severity.\n\nYou need to do better! Sounds like you are attempting to be a kitten rescue, but you need to do a but much better job educating yourself and future adoptees on kitten health.", "But if you still gave the cat medication about the time he was supposed to be adopted then you really should have told your friend! Medicating a cat can be really hard work so omitting that information beforehand is really a-hole behaviour. So which is it? Was the kitten sick or not? She needed to medicate the kitten but did you continue to medicate the cat up until the time of the adoption or not?", "If that's the case then you should edit the post. It says that you DIDN'T mention the flu to her.", "On the adoption date, the kitten wasn't sick. The few days leading up to it he was in very good health and looked like he'd already recovered. But I was still feeding him a course of multi-vitamins and also eyedrops as a precaution.", "And that's where you become the AH. You were still medicating the kitten up until the adoption but you didn't tell your friend about it. Your friends behaviour is also pretty bad, you don't have a party when you bring home a new kitten. When we got our furbaby we made every preparation (including getting her the exact same food as she had been eating in her old home) and we let her explore on her own. That's also a-hole behaviour on your part, you shouldn't have dropped the kitten of during the middle of a party!"]}
