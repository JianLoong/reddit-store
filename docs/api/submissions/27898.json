My 14 year old is the subject of this post. I\u2019ll call him Andrew.\n\nAndrew has recently begun his first year of high school. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because we live closer to a different high school than most of his former classmates ended up at. Luckily one of his very close friends from a few years back goes to his school. A girl I will call Dana. They have become close again over the last 6ish weeks. They spend time together at school and she has been coming over on weekends, or him at her house. Andrew talks about her a lot. To be honest, I thought they had crushes on each other. By the way, Dana is mixed black with Vietnamese and we are white. Unfortunately that is relevant. \n\nLast weekend Dana was over for dinner. Things were going normally until my 11 year old made a joke about Dana being Andrew\u2019s girlfriend. My husband and he have been lightly teasing Andrew for a couple of weeks about Dana being his girlfriend and he always denies it hotly. That night after my 11 year old\u2019s joke, Andrew not only denied it but spouted a, \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE BLACK GIRLS!\u201d loudly for the entire table to hear, including Dana. I was stunned. Dana looked highly embarrassed. I knew in the moment I would talk to him later, but just for the time being said something like, \u201chey, that isn\u2019t cool.\u201d The remainder of dinner was very awkward and then Dana left.\n\nOnce she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt Dana\u2019s feelings. I explained how black women and girls already struggle with feeling accepted in society, and that he was ignoring the other half of her race entirely. Not to mention the bad example he was setting for his brother. He went on defensive mode and said he just thinks dark girls are \u201cugly\u201d and is tired of people at home and at school thinking he would date, \u201csomeone like her.\u201d After that conversation I told him that he was grounded until he offered Dana a sincere apology and made an effort to learn about miogynoir through reading. I then told him that if I were Dana, I would not want to be his friend anymore after his racist remarks. \n\nTo my astonishment, this has been unpopular with my ex as well as my current husband. My current husband is puerto rican, so I was doubly surprised he didn\u2019t side with me. They both say that Andrew is entitled to his own preferences when it comes to girls and I am wrong to punish him. I took it more seriously from my current husband who has been on the receiving end of racism. I now do not know what to do. Andrew has apologized to D, but has yet to find a good book on misogynoir and read it. Am I wrong for punishing him? Should I let him off the hook? AITA?", "created_utc": 1696020786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vn0gn/aita_for_punishing_my_son_for_his_preferences/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sons are both in the wrong: 11m for cracking wise at the table about \"girlfriends,\" and Andrew's massive overreaction with heavy notes of racism. This makes me wonder if he doesn't have feelings of a kind for Dana. Disappointing that both the dads are dismissing this as \"preference.\"\n\nThe only AHs here are the y-chromosome bearers.", "NTA\nOf course your son is allowed to have his preferences, but the way he expressed them - in front of Dana - and afterwards is unacceptable.\nUsing words like he would never date \u201csomeone like her\u201d is just rude and racist.\nI understand that he is annoyed by people assuming, but a normal \u201cwe are just friends and don\u2019t have romantic feelings for each other\u201d would have done it and not also hurt his friend and demean her. \nAlso AH btw are ur younger son and husband for \u201cteasing\u201d your son for his close friendship to a girl. They should be punished too \ud83d\ude09", "NTA\n\n\"Being entitled to your own preferences\" doesn't mean being rude to those who doesn't \"fit\" them\n\nHe could have asked to stop the teasing in kind.\n\nThe friendship with the girl probably will end or at least they won't have the same trust.\n\nBooks, or groups about sensitization or just being discreet", "ESH but Dana. Your husband and younger son have been teasing the 14 year old for weeks l about this, which has been \u201cdenied hotly\u201d, which you apparently haven\u2019t shut down. Then, when the younger son begins teasing (which again isn\u2019t shut down) everyone\u2019s all shocked pikachu when the 14 year old *once again* \u201cdenies hotly\u201d that he likes his friend. Now, Dana\u2019s feelings are hurt (rightly), and the 14 year old now has to come to terms with the fact that he probably lost a good friend. \n\nInstead of continuing to back him into the corner that everyone else has by pressing him to apologize, maybe talk to him and help him figure out his *actual* feelings instead of the knee-jerk lashing out feelings he shows. I think that\u2019ll be far more productive, and he\u2019s likely to apologize on his own once he can figure his feelings out.", "When they have something to say tell them \u201c he can have preferences that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to speak as if anything other then his preferences is bad. He was acting racist and that\u2019s not okay with me and it shouldn\u2019t be with you.\u201d \nAnd tell them that it\u2019s not what he said exactly it\u2019s how he said it\u2019s of her being black was a bad thing \nHe could\u2019ve said \u201c she\u2019s my friend and I don\u2019t see her that way\u201d he didn\u2019t have to bring race into it at all \nBut he did \nAnd that\u2019s where the convo of it not being okay needs to come in", "> My husband and he have been lightly teasing Andrew for a couple of weeks about Dana being his girlfriend and he always denies it hotly.\n\nWell, then, ESH except Dana. Your husband for teasing your son and encouraging your other son to go along with it, your older son for blowing up in such a rude way, and you for allowing this all to happen - and if you want your son to read a book on this topic then you need to provide it to him.", "ESH, except Dana. It looks to me like he's fed up of the teasing and was embarrassed in front of Dana. He didn't want her to think he'd described her to his family as his girlfriend, tried to make it clear he hadn't said that and was so vehement he made an arse of it. \n\nFourteen year olds are easily embarrassed by their families, especially in front of their friends, and sometimes they're clumsy with their words. It's possible he's racist, or has been picking up racist viewpoints from others, but it's also possible he's a socially awkward teenage idiot. \n\nDoing some reading around racism and misogyny and misogynoir would be a good thing for him, same as it would be for anyone, but it shouldn't be used as a punishment.", "The whole family kind of sucks for \"teasing him for weeks\" about something. That's called bullying, mom. You know that, though, right? If a kid at school teased you every day for having glasses, or having an overbite, or being a foster kid, that would be bullying. You let your family bully and harass your son. So yeah you all kinda suck there.    \n\n\nHonestly I don't blame your son at all for blowing up at the table. It's *how* he blew up that's problematic. NTA for removing privileges until he apologizes to the girl. I think the entire family needs to work on being better people. Y'all should apologize to your son, too.", "ESH. Kid for obvious reasons. You and your family for constantly teasing him, IN FRONT OF HER apparently??? Girls and boys can be friends without nothing romantic between them.", "ESH.\n\nHim, for being mean to Dana.\n\nBut you, I want to talk about you. \"Lightly teasing, about being his girlfriend \". **for weeks!**\n\n I think perhaps, you and his sibling have tormented him into blowing up, and poor Dana got the backlash.\n\nI think you already got him to apologise to Dana for what he said, and you should accept that you goaded him into it.\n\nHe doubled down, because you bullied him to associating Dana, and girls who look like Dana, with your childish teasing, and at some level, your husband gets it, and wants it dropped.", "There\u2019s a few Ys to go around. Obviously,Andrew\u2019s outburst was just unacceptable but what\u2019s with the teasing? The younger boy might have resorted to it (and should have been firmly reprimanded for it) but dad too? He should be aware as you should be that at Andrew\u2019s age,everything is magnified by fifty. Are we back in the shitty 80s all of a sudden? \n\n NTA for taking Andrew\u2019s words seriously,but YTA for *not* taking the teasing just as much so.", "This is bigger than who is the A. \n\nTalk with your son. \n\nDana doesn't deserve that. \n\nNobody does. \n\nWhere did your son pick up garbage like that at his age?", "NTA. You are right and you're not punishing him for his preference. You're punishing him becayse of his attitude towards black girl. You can not be attracted to someone without acting the way he did. \n\nAnd as a black man I gotta be honest. Take your husband's take with a grain of salt. Puerto Rican people and most people of all racists regardless of if they have experienced racism don't understand the complexities of racism. Especially the more their society values whiteness. Latin and Hispanic communities that are considered black still perform misogynoir let alone if he's a white Puerto Rican. You can recognize the deeper complexities that he writes off. \n\nYou're right, don't let him off it's better to try better his attitude now even if they disagree with you. Even if he doesn't like it, even if he still thinks that way maybe that seed will bloom when he grows enough to understand why this is wrong.", "NTA, you seem like a great mom explaining why you don't say something like that. It seems he's more worried about what people at school think, and with both Dad's backing him up, he feels even more justified. \n\nHaving a dating preference is one thing, but that's definitely not how this came across.", "Your husband and ex are right that he\u2019s allowed to have preferences, but he doesn\u2019t need to make these preferences known to his supposed friend in such a cruel manner. Punishment fits the crime. NTA", "ESH\n\nYou should not be teasing your son about this, he\u2019s obvious sensitive and it\u2019s rude AF.\n\nYour son definitely should not have said what he said.\n\nYeah, everyone just sucks.", "NTA.  He's entitled to his preferences but not to de-humanize another race completely.  My guess is your husband and your ex don't like black girls either.", "NTA, but it would be helpful if you expound on why what he said is a problem. A blanket statement like that suggests that all black women look exactly the same, have the same personality, the same values, etc. It's dehumanizing and reductive. Black women are unique individuals; the only way someone could be sure they would never be interested in any black woman is if they are...I think you can fill it in here. Time to do a deep dive into his social media and figure out where this is coming from.", "I don't think your punishment is bad. He is entitled to have his preferences, but that doesn't mean he has to be a dick about it. I would give some freedoms back due to the apology, but maybe ask him what he thinks about apologizing? Did he do it because after your talk he reflected on it and realized he was being a dick, or did he do it because you're making him. He may think black women are ugly, but there are ways to communicate like this \"I don't find black women attractive\" is majorly different than \"Black women are ugly\" and how we think does effect how we act (I know that sounds weird but go with it). Maybe you could reach out to Dana and get her take? \n\nSomeone else here brought up peer pressure, and god I would hate to see a school where the pressure was to be hateful. Hate is a poison that kills only the one holding on to it, and to have that due to uncontrollable reasons will have it sink further. \n\nNTA.", "NTA he needs to understand how to be polite.  He is allowed preferences.  He should not be allowed to be racist; I don't think he is this is his friend.  You should not try to push a relationship on him though, and your other son should not say things like this is his \"girlfriend\".  It's normal for people to have friends of all genders and skin tones, and he shouldn't have to keep reminding his own family that they are just friends.", "Not at all wrong for punishing him.  But, I think you're sending mixed signals here.\n\nHe deserved to be punished for his outburst, for saying a really shitty thing to Dana.  This is about learning discretion, respect, and diversity.  In short, he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut and not hurt others.\n\nThat said, he should **not** be punished for who he is attracted to.  All of us humans have folks we are more attracted to and folks we are less (or not) attracted to.  For many reasons, not just race.  That is human nature and 110% ok.  You are making a mountain out of a molehill by telling him he needs to read a book on misogynoir.", "NTA, and this wasn't just preference choice, this was a racist comment.  \nThis is 100% a teachable moment.  \nYou can almost always talk about what you do or don't like, without being an ass or a creep.  \nAnd I do mean almost, as I have been involved\\\\witness to a few conversations where person A is interested in person B, but B is not even remotely interested in A and A is pushing for an answer or a date and not accepting a no. That's just a train wreck for everyone.", "Family teases child.  Child acts like child.  Negative results all around.\n\nThis isn't about preferences.  If he said, \"she's not my type\" there would not have been an issue.\n\nAlso none of this would have happened if the parents and by extension the sibling wasn't teasing him.", "Please fix the dynamic of teasing around this relationship. He is at the age where it's tender, he's learning and a bunch of teasing is torture.\n\nIt may be platonic. My best friend was a boy growing up and boy did we get rowed DAILY. It was completely innocent and my best memories.", "ESH.  Your son is 100% wrong in his outburst, and Dana was probably hurt and humiliated.  But you were teasing him--it wasn't just his brother--about her being his girlfriend when it is just as likely that the friendship is platonic.\n\nHe is 14.  Having a girlfriend (or BOYFRIEND) isn't unheard of but it's also not something you should be pushing on him.  A lot of people don't date at 14.\n\nHell, pushing the relationship angle is annoying no matter the age.", "YTA/EHS your family harassed Andrew until he snapped and the only one youre mad at is Andrew.", ">Once she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt Dana\u2019s feelings.\n\nYa think??", "Racism is not a preference. Your son is obviously free to prefer different physical characteristics in girls, but he's way past old enough to know how repulsive it is to shout that out, especially in the presence of the girl herself.\n\nI think you handled this beautifully. NTA.", "NTA. The thing is our preferences don\u2019t just emerge from solely within. There are a host of societal conditions that tell us what is attractive/Beautiful and what is not. Even though there is a lot of variety of facial features and body types, it\u2019s kind of clear that the features that get the most praise are those that are the most closely associated with whiteness. That\u2019s why your son\u2019s outburst is unfortunate. He wasn\u2019t expressing a preference, as many here have stated. He was expressing a prejudice. He needs to unlearn that.\n\nThe men in your life, for reasons I can\u2019t explain here, are simply not the people to ask. They also need to read about Beauty politics, lol.\n\nIt might be helpful for your son if you chose the book.", "NTA Everyone has a type, but the way he said it was just downright mean and racist", "NYA. He was being racist, however he should be allowed to date whoever he likes. He\u2019s allowed to not want to date someone with dark skin so long as he is a good person to them just the same, and still was okay with being around them. His comments sound disgusting.", "NTA.  As I see it, you punished your son for being insensitive (horrible) to a guest and for acting racist, not for having preferences. If a \"preference\" is skin color, that person has a prejudice. Then stating that \"preference\" in racial terms confirms it.\n\nPeople learn racism at home - check on the example your husband and ex are giving your sons. And being part of a group that gets discriminated against doesn't prevent someone from being racist.", "NTA, I would say you are more teaching your kid about being respectfu, rather than misogynoir.\n\nWe all have physical preferences at first for an other person, you can't really blame him as it is somewhat natural. However it is not because someone is \"not your type\" that you can't be friends with this person. Sadly being in high school surrounded by lot of immature teenagers, added with the social pressure I would not be surprised he is being bugged. \n\nYou should also try to make him understand how saddened her friend must have been to receive such comments, specially coming from her \"friend\".\n\nYou kid definitely owes Dana an apology.", "NTA: He was cruel and awful to Dana. Honestly, I would have defended her more vehemently right in front of her. He was a terrible friend. He can have his preferences but his attitudes are racist.", "You're kinda sending mixed signals here, but NTA\n\nHe should absolutely be punished for hurting Dana's feelings. He's 14, so he was probably embarrassed and didn't know how to deal with the teasing, but that was inappropriate.\n\nHowever, he shouldn't be punished for having a preference. Trying to change who he finds attractive is wrong. Not finding a race attractive doesn't mean he should need to research misogynoir.\n\nHe should be punished for his outburst, *not* for having a preference.", "I don't think you're the AH for punishing him for his outburst. There is NO reason him embarrassing Dana would ever be okay, but your find appealing what you find appealing. I know white guys who DON'T like white girls, you can't really pick what you find attractive I don't think.", "I don\u2019t think the issue is that he has this preference. We cannot help what we like. I think the issue is that saying what he said in a generalized negative way about a certain race of people, whoever they are , is unnecessary , offensive because it\u2019s an insult, and ultimately is discrimination.  It would be rude to say he thought all tall people were ugly and saying that in front of a tall person would be very offensive to that person, and also generalizations like that really are not accurate and are hurtful.  It\u2019s his expression of his preference that is the real issue not so much the preference alone.  He basically called his friend ugly right to her face at the dinner table and whatever reason he said that it\u2019s still rude and should not have been said it\u2019s really really rude. I don\u2019t know if I would make this too much about race because I think that\u2019s just a small part of this .  I\u2019d say more it is discrimination and it was a rude comment regardless of why he said it. NTA as you\u2019re trying to do the right thing and you\u2019re just feeling your way to it and need advice.  There is nothing wrong with that.", "You are punishing him for the wrong thing. He completely embarrassed his friend, who was a guest at your house. He does not seem like a bigot, he sounds like a typical 14 year old idiot teenage boy. ESH.", "NTA you didn't punish him for his preferences and you aren't forcing him to date girls he finds unattractive. You called him out for his behavior of being rude and saying something that embarrassed his friend who was a guest in your home.", "YTA\nFor making him read a book. It will backfire. It won\u2019t work. Those books have EXACTLY the same narration and pushy attitude as people around him. Nobody likes to be forced into anything. \n\nInstead you should explain that while he is entitled to his preferences it is not excuse for being rude. Also, your 11 years old should be lectured RIGHT AFTER making comment about him being his girlfriend. This is what escalated this whole s show.", "Scold him WITHOUT using the words racism, misogyny, skin color, black, etc. because it has nothing to do with those words.\n\nHe is entitled to say he doesn't like black girls.

I understand you don\u2019t want him to hold certain beliefs/preferences/whatever you want to call it, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the right to ground him solely because you didn\u2019t like what he said. Had you grounded him for being disrespectful & inappropriate in front of a guest when they should feel welcome in your home, I\u2019d be on your side 100%.\n\nI agree; Dana shouldn\u2019t be friends with him. I wouldn\u2019t be. That said, do I think he has the right to date/not date whom ever he wants for any reason? Yes. People find certain looks attractive.

Ugh.", "NTA Your ex and husband are right, your son is entitled to date and not date however he wants.  \n\nBut that isn't the issue here or why he was punished. Your problem was with his outburst, and the cause of his outburst was being angry people would think he liked \"someone like her\".  This is 10 degrees of fucked up and you are right on point with your response. \n\nMaybe time to help him find a book and buy 3 copies?", "NTA\n\nBut anyone who thinks what Andrew did is 'okay because preferences' needs their head examined. Stick with the punishment because he's only going to learn from being educated and seems like you're the only adult with a brain.", "He's an AH for how he went about it, but he's not an AH for having preferences on who he wants to date.", "100% what your son said was not said nicely however you have to look at it this way. \n\nYour son has befriended this girl and everyone keeps saying they are dating. He corrects it and requests people to stop bringing it up. They have ignored him repeatedly and kept doing it. \n\nNow think back to when you were pregnant with him and you had to deal with MIL at the time. Did MIL repeatedly ask you about the gender and name of unborn baby? Did you ask her to stop doing so? At some point you probably blew up. \n\nYes what he said in front of Dana was uncalled for. Him being angry at being teased was justified.", "NTA  \n\nTo me, it doesn\u2019t sound like you were punishing him for having preferences, you were punishing him for having a completely inappropriate meltdown at dinner and insulting his guest. \n\nIf I were that girl I would never speak to him again.

Number 1 reason, telling him black women and girls are victims. Is that really what you want to teach him as a parent?  He has a right to his preferences.", "YTA\n\nYou are assuming a lot behind his intentions. He's a kid, and he's constantly being teased about dating his friend because she is a girl. That's pressure, and it will make a kid say stupid things. You should have done more to understand why he said that, as opposed to just dumping guilt all over him like that. \n\nAdditionally, it feels weird to bring up the fact that he wasn't taking into account the other half of her race. I don't know how that's important and it seems to imply that her being half asian is better than being full black. Which, if he is racist, would maybe explain where it came from.", "Yes, that pretty much sums up racism. Making her a victim in his eyes when it wasn't about that. His preference sounds like not black/Vietnamese girls, which is fine. Yet you went straight to the victimizing scenario and created an issue where there was none. Making it about race on any one single instance is what keeps it in the minds of people. Racism is sick and twisted but it also survives on the constant talk about it.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your son's preferences. \n\nIt's racism pure and simple. \n\nAnd he's learning it from somewhere.\n\nIt's a parent's job to teach it is wrong and horrible.", "You are absolutely the ahole", "This story sounds too suspicious", "YTA  \nStop sexualizing little kids. Calling someone another person's girl/boyfriend is hinting at their sexuality and assuming their gender identity. \n\nIt's just gross to label a 11-ish little girl 'dateable'. What are you trying to force on them?  \nThat disaster is 100% on you, also because you knew perfectly what you were doing in trying to embarrass at least one of them. Here you embarrassed one and managed to get the other hurt. How could you even think that was a good idea. Also, it seems that you have been harassing both about that matter. How comes you're that obssessed with little kids sexuality? You sound like a pervert.  \nLast, a 11 years old doesn't have the mental capacity to disguise their feelings like an adult used to political correctness. Punishing a little kid you cornered, for not being able to find the right words is just the cherry on the cake here.", "YTA.  Having preferences is not being racist.

My 14 year old is the subject of this post. I\u2019ll call him Andrew.\n\nAndrew has recently begun his first year of high school. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because we live closer to a different high school than most of his former classmates ended up at. Luckily one of his very close friends from a few years back goes to his school. A girl I will call D. They have become close again over the last 6ish weeks. They spend time together at school and she has been coming over on weekends, or him at her house. Andrew talks about her a lot. To be honest, I thought they had crushes on each other. By the way, D is mixed black with Vietnamese and we are white. Unfortunately that is relevant. \n\nLast weekend D was over for dinner. Things were going normally until my 11 year old made a joke about D being Andrew\u2019s girlfriend. My husband and he have been lightly teasing Andrew for a couple of weeks about D being his girlfriend and he always denies it hotly. That night after my 11 year old\u2019s joke, Andrew not only denied it but spouted a, \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE BLACK GIRLS!\u201d loudly for the entire table to hear, including D. I was stunned. D looked highly embarrassed. I knew in the moment I would talk to him later, but just for the time being said something like, \u201chey, that isn\u2019t cool.\u201d The remainder of dinner was very awkward and then D left.\n\nOnce she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt D\u2019s feelings. I explained how black women and girls already struggle with feeling accepted in society, and that he was ignoring the other half of her race entirely. Not to mention the bad example he was setting for his brother. He went on defensive mode and said he just thinks dark girls are \u201cugly\u201d and is tired of people at home and at school thinking he would date, \u201csomeone like her.\u201d After that conversation I told him that he was grounded until he offered D a sincere apology and made an effort to learn about miogynoir through reading. I then told him that if I were D, I would not want to be his friend anymore after his racist remarks. \n\nTo my astonishment, this has been unpopular with my ex as well as my current husband. My current husband is puerto rican, so I was doubly surprised he didn\u2019t side with me. They both say that Andrew is entitled to his own preferences when it comes to girls and I am wrong to punish him. I took it more seriously from my current husband who has been on the receiving end of racism. I now do not know what to do. Andrew has apologized to D, but has yet to find a good book on misogynoir and read it. Am I wrong for punishing him? Should I let him off the hook? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's another to blurt it out in a way that hurts someone's feelings like that. This is what I would focus on.\n\nPeople's preferences change over time. It's also the case that the whole concept of race is pretty artificial. There's a HUGE variation in skin tone, facial features and body types for each nationality and so-called race. It's more a self-assigned cultural designation than a physical type.\n\nI think it's a LOT to ask for someone his age to get into the details of a book about misogynoir as such. Maybe a better choice would be to find books about racial struggles from the standpoint of someone his age. That way he gets a broader understanding about what it's like for someone who's in a minority and hopefully learn empathy.\n\nThere's some good books available for school kids these days on that. A great way to find them would be to ask your librarian or a teacher. NPR has done some recent articles on them.

You raised a raging asshole. With your ex and your current husband's comments, it is no wonder he is like *that*. Personally, I wouldn't date something like your son.", "You are NTA. Your son however, is very much TA. It's okay to have preferences and to not be attracted to certain physical features, including skin tone/ethnicity. What is not okay is to just say it in the way he said it, completely disregarding her feelings and possibly making her feel less than just because of her ethnicity which is absolutely unacceptable. He could have simply said \"I don't feel that way about her, we are just friends\" and that would be enough of an explanation. Sure, being rejected that way hurts but it's not nearly as bad as dismissing an entire group of people just because they happened to be born with a darker skin tone. It's bad enough that the beauty industry and media has been whitewashed for so long, no need to add to it. That's the kind of stuff that he should just keep to himself and find other reasons to decline someone's advances if they happen to hit on him and not fit his preferences. The other thing is that it's not okay to only be nice / respectful to people he finds attractive and to be mean to all others. This is a very common issue among men, and it needs to stop. There is also a huge difference between saying \"I am not attracted to x group of people\" and saying \"x group of people are ugly\". It's fine to not be attracted, but it's not fine to insult them.", "NTA for demanding he apologize to the girl. He could have done so much better on denying whatever happens to him with her, but...\n\nPlease, take into account all the signs around this situation. It's not OK punishing him for his preferences, in case he was telling the truth. You will only make him resent more the whole situation. And I want to make perfectly clear that you acted the way you should about the way he expressed it, he should never talk the way he did about anyone or to anyone, but extending the punishment and making it about his preferences would do more harm.\n\nOn the other hand, you don't know if the teasing comes only from your other son and your husband. I have the feeling something else is going on here that goes beyond his true feelings about the girl. Maybe he heard someone at school saying something about it. Maybe he thinks people will judge him if they find out he likes her and the teasing in your house only makes him feel worst.\n\nHave an honest chat with him. Make him know it is safe to express whatever happens to you and act according to that. Do not judge him. Do not think bad of him. Right now, you are showing he can't trust you with his feelings or with his preferences because you will punish him if you don't agree. Teach him to express in a better and healthier way. And talk to your other son and husband and teach them not to mock others just because of their feelings or relationships.\n\nYou have a window of opportunity here. You can come closer to your son and teach him a lot of things. You can teach him it's OK to talk to you if he is having trouble, you can teach him he can talk to you if he needs advice. You can teach him that no matter what, he has your full support. You can teach him it is OK to being wrong as long as he can feel regret and make things right. And you can teach him it's OK if he likes asian girls or blondes or redheads or muslims or whatever as long as he treats them with respect and he is happy. Or you can punish him and make sure he will resent this situation and whenever he needs to talk to someone about something he thinks you are not gonna like, then he will not going to talk to you and will receive any (probably) shitty advice from someone else.", "NTA.

He can have whatever preferences he wants in his head, but once he says them out loud he is engaging in discriminatory speech, and that what you are punishing.\n\nAlso, his \"preference\" is bullshit.

It\u2019s important that gets communicated to him - he\u2019s not being punished for not being attracted to Dana. And he doesn\u2019t have to treat all black/nonwhite women with kid gloves. It wouldn\u2019t be kind for him to scream \u201cI don\u2019t like white girls\u201d in front of his white female friend either. \n\nHe does need to understand when and how it\u2019s okay to express those feelings. Phrases like \u201csomeone like her\u201d are gonna sound derogatory to a lot of people, even if he truly doesn\u2019t mean it to be. If there\u2019s an indication he\u2019s led this girl on, that needs to be discussed too. 14-year-olds say and do stupid things that look way worse than intended. That\u2019s part of life. And part of parenting is calling them out on that shit and redirecting it appropriately. Good on you.", "NTA. It was a moment you needed to step in as a parent and teach your child to be respectful to others and that saying things like that isnt okay. What he said is honestly something she will probably be hurt by for a long time if she is ever in the dating world and feeling undesired, she will remember what your son said, and think everyone looks at her that way. Whether or not Andrew wants to date Dana, or be open to dating certain people is his business, but I think you definitely did the right thing by disciplining him. I think requiring him to research and read up on \"Misogynoir\" is a big overstep and pretty cringe. There are other lessons to be learned here other than some fringe social justice theory of how black women are perceived in socie-blah blah blah. Just teach him to be respectful and considerate to everyone, and to make right when he wrongs others, and youre good \ud83d\udc4d \n\nI doubt Andrew is a bad kid, he is just 14 and says stupid things on impulse and without consideration for others. I was a 14 year old boy once and did the same thing. In 8th grade I called a thin girl who liked me an \u201cAnorexic wh*re\u201d just cuz I thought it would be funny. I broke up with a girl in 9th grade just cuz my family teased me about her name\u2026 I grew up to realize these things were stupid and unfunny. Im sure he will too.", "ESH, except for Dana obviously. I'm not gonna comment on the racist part, others have done that well enough.\n\nHowever, the rest of you are AHs for the teasing. It's not funny, it's juvenile. If Andrew has asked you to stop, you stop, period. All you're doing is screwing up his friendship with Dana. He could have a crush on her, he could just want to be friends with her only. Leave it alone.\n\nI say this as someone who endured this exact thing. I never talked to my parents about any relationships I had because I didn't trust them. It ended with me having a screaming match with them. It wasn't pretty to say the least, but I was fed up with it.", "Don't make finding a book and reading it just his task. Find documentaries and watch them together. Watch films and shows that aren't docs that address it, too. Listen to podcasts together and discuss them. Make it a family activity to broaden your horizons and understand. Reading a book all on his own isn't likely to be the most effective thing here.", "NTA. \n\nAnyone can have any kind of \"preference\" they want, but blanket statements like \"Dark girls are ugly\" is NOT a preference. it's motivated by colorism and prejudice. \n\nFurthermore, no matter what someone's \"preference\" is? It stops being \"just a preference\" when they start making it everyone else's problem. \n\nYour son was out of like. he can like whatever he likes- but he was damn RUDE to that girl.

To make matters worse you seem to want them to \"read away their preference\" from their perspective.\n\nSo injustice, predictable response, more injustice is the lesson I think most kids in his shoes would take away from this. This is bad parenting. Try to think about what response you want to get or what lesson you want to teach someone. And how your delivery might work on that person.

That same narrative that encourages toxic masculinity and sexism towards women? The reasons he had such a strong assertion is because everyone has been bullying him over this topic for weeks now.

Your bad assumptions made you complicit in allowing  the bullying his father and brother were doing. All of this combined sends a message to your 14year old that his emotions do not matter. FFS this is how we get incels. We teach men they can't just be friends with girls and that the only way they can have any emotion is sexual ones. Weither he has a crush on her or not does not matter.

Thus, you haven\u2019t really solved a problem & he still thinks it\u2019s okay to be rude to guests. That isn\u2019t my idea of a parenting success. :/", "Many, many people across all different subjects treat their preference as the default.\n\nThis is to say that most people will say that any aesthetic that does not appeal to their personal preferences is \"ugly\".\n\nDoesn't mean underlying racism.", "I am really surprised by the comments here. What OP's son said was not about his personal dating preferences. He made a disgusting, blanket, racist statement. If either of my kids said something like that I would be horribly disappointed in them as people. I would also wonder what I was missing that would make them think those kinds of statements were EVER ok to make. \n\nOP is right to question her child more, and also to discipline him for what he said. Perhaps he needs to spend some time reading up on Black history and systemic racism during his grounding. I feel terrible for Dana and, honestly, I hope she knows her own value and distances herself from OP's son. I'm really not sure that there's an apology that can ever undo the damage of what OP let fall out of his mouth and heart. And, if the ex and current husband don't see anything wrong with what their son/stepson said, I would start looking at them as a possible source of this racist garbage.", "[deleted]", "In OPs own words they\u2019ve been on him about this relationship for weeks. He tells them no. But they keep pushing. Then the 14 year old predictably snaps. People certainly say things they don\u2019t really mean when they get frustrated. Kids not attracted to black girls. He\u2019s 14 and was not able to articulate that in moment.", "I disagree, I'm from south America and I don't like black, fat or short women. I think they look ugly to my standards, I treat them with the same respect I treat everyone else, I just don't pursue a relationship with them.", "I agree that the way he expressed himself was very poor, you don't say stuff like that, but forcing him to change his standards and not believe a certain type of woman is ugly is not good either. He is allowed to have whatever preferences he wants as long as he doesn't purposefully hurt anyone. In this case, he did with the way he spoke and that is why this is ESH in my opinion.", "He said he doesn't like black girls, I'm guessing he is talking about skin color instead of race overall.\n\nOf course, I agree that he was offensive in the way he spoke.", "It think it\u2019s more of \u201cI\u2019ll pretend to think whatever you want.\u201d", ">This is to say that most people will say that any aesthetic that does not appeal to their personal preferences is \"ugly\".\n\nIt\u2019s different when you are talking about someone\u2019s race as opposed to a furniture design, for example.", "I really think you are arguing a point I have never made to be frank.", "He was able to articulate it though. He said he didn\u2019t like black girls, and then got defensive and started talking like a racist. You can end it at \u201ci don\u2019t like/am not attracted to (whatever race)\u201d. I don\u2019t lines white guys, as an example (which is actually true). That doesn\u2019t mean I go around saying all white guys are ugly, because that\u2019s 1) rude as fuck, 2) wholly untrue, 3) really weird to do, and 4) I\u2019d fucking hate it if someone told me I was ugly simply because I\u2019m white or because I\u2019m Native. If someone said they weren\u2019t interested because I\u2019m white or because I\u2019m Native, yeah, it sucks but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. It\u2019s literally just their preference and it isn\u2019t hateful to say.\n\nSaying you\u2019re not into a particular race is fine, and he did that. OP probably should have told him that he shouldn\u2019t shouted that in front of everyone like he did and that that is one of those topics to be gentler with, but once he started in on generalizing that ALL black women are ugly, it became additional behaviors that needed to be corrected."]}
