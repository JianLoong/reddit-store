My 14 year old is the subject of this post. I\u2019ll call him Andrew.\n\nAndrew has recently begun his first year of high school. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because we live closer to a different high school than most of his former classmates ended up at. Luckily one of his very close friends from a few years back goes to his school. A girl I will call Dana. They have become close again over the last 6ish weeks. They spend time together at school and she has been coming over on weekends, or him at her house. Andrew talks about her a lot. To be honest, I thought they had crushes on each other. By the way, Dana is mixed black with Vietnamese and we are white. Unfortunately that is relevant. \n\nLast weekend Dana was over for dinner. Things were going normally until my 11 year old made a joke about Dana being Andrew\u2019s girlfriend. My husband and he have been lightly teasing Andrew for a couple of weeks about Dana being his girlfriend and he always denies it hotly. That night after my 11 year old\u2019s joke, Andrew not only denied it but spouted a, \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE BLACK GIRLS!\u201d loudly for the entire table to hear, including Dana. I was stunned. Dana looked highly embarrassed. I knew in the moment I would talk to him later, but just for the time being said something like, \u201chey, that isn\u2019t cool.\u201d The remainder of dinner was very awkward and then Dana left.\n\nOnce she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt Dana\u2019s feelings. I explained how black women and girls already struggle with feeling accepted in society, and that he was ignoring the other half of her race entirely. Not to mention the bad example he was setting for his brother. He went on defensive mode and said he just thinks dark girls are \u201cugly\u201d and is tired of people at home and at school thinking he would date, \u201csomeone like her.\u201d After that conversation I told him that he was grounded until he offered Dana a sincere apology and made an effort to learn about miogynoir through reading. I then told him that if I were Dana, I would not want to be his friend anymore after his racist remarks. \n\nTo my astonishment, this has been unpopular with my ex as well as my current husband. My current husband is puerto rican, so I was doubly surprised he didn\u2019t side with me. They both say that Andrew is entitled to his own preferences when it comes to girls and I am wrong to punish him. I took it more seriously from my current husband who has been on the receiving end of racism. I now do not know what to do. Andrew has apologized to D, but has yet to find a good book on misogynoir and read it. Am I wrong for punishing him? Should I let him off the hook? AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you everyone for your input. I want to say that I see now I was wrong to view the teasing as lighthearted when it upset my son and led to him lashing out. I feel the need to reaffirm that it was not me who personally was involved in the teasing which seems to be a common misconception. That said, I haven\u2019t argued the point because I can see I was in the wrong for not putting an end to the teasing, and it makes me no better than if I were directly involved. \n\nI believe after this thread that I am justified in my punishment of my son for his racism, but the rest of owe him an apology just as he owed Dana one. I am going to follow through with the grounding, but I will have a talk with Andrew about what was going on, and try to explain again why he was apologizing.\nI appreciate all of the recommendations on books and documentaries.", "created_utc": 1696020786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vn0gn/aita_for_punishing_my_son_for_his_preferences/", "score": 1388, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sons are both in the wrong: 11m for cracking wise at the table about \"girlfriends,\" and Andrew's massive overreaction with heavy notes of racism. This makes me wonder if he doesn't have feelings of a kind for Dana. Disappointing that both the dads are dismissing this as \"preference.\"\n\nThe only AHs here are the y-chromosome bearers.", "NTA\nOf course your son is allowed to have his preferences, but the way he expressed them - in front of Dana - and afterwards is unacceptable.\nUsing words like he would never date \u201csomeone like her\u201d is just rude and racist.\nI understand that he is annoyed by people assuming, but a normal \u201cwe are just friends and don\u2019t have romantic feelings for each other\u201d would have done it and not also hurt his friend and demean her. \nAlso AH btw are ur younger son and husband for \u201cteasing\u201d your son for his close friendship to a girl.

Your husband and younger son have been teasing the 14 year old for weeks l about this, which has been \u201cdenied hotly\u201d, which you apparently haven\u2019t shut down.

Now, Dana\u2019s feelings are hurt (rightly), and the 14 year old now has to come to terms with the fact that he probably lost a good friend. \n\nInstead of continuing to back him into the corner that everyone else has by pressing him to apologize, maybe talk to him and help him figure out his *actual* feelings instead of the knee-jerk lashing out feelings he shows. I think that\u2019ll be far more productive, and he\u2019s likely to apologize on his own once he can figure his feelings out.", "When they have something to say tell them \u201c he can have preferences that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to speak as if anything other then his preferences is bad.

Your husband for teasing your son and encouraging your other son to go along with it, your older son for blowing up in such a rude way, and you for allowing this all to happen - and if you want your son to read a book on this topic then you need to provide it to him.", "ESH, except Dana. It looks to me like he's fed up of the teasing and was embarrassed in front of Dana. He didn't want her to think he'd described her to his family as his girlfriend, tried to make it clear he hadn't said that and was so vehement he made an arse of it. \n\nFourteen year olds are easily embarrassed by their families, especially in front of their friends, and sometimes they're clumsy with their words. It's possible he's racist, or has been picking up racist viewpoints from others, but it's also possible he's a socially awkward teenage idiot. \n\nDoing some reading around racism and misogyny and misogynoir would be a good thing for him, same as it would be for anyone, but it shouldn't be used as a punishment.", "The whole family kind of sucks for \"teasing him for weeks\" about something. That's called bullying, mom. You know that, though, right? If a kid at school teased you every day for having glasses, or having an overbite, or being a foster kid, that would be bullying. You let your family bully and harass your son. So yeah you all kinda suck there.    \n\n\nHonestly I don't blame your son at all for blowing up at the table. It's *how* he blew up that's problematic. NTA for removing privileges until he apologizes to the girl. I think the entire family needs to work on being better people. Y'all should apologize to your son, too.", "ESH. Kid for obvious reasons. You and your family for constantly teasing him, IN FRONT OF HER apparently??? Girls and boys can be friends without nothing romantic between them.", "ESH.\n\nHim, for being mean to Dana.\n\nBut you, I want to talk about you. \"Lightly teasing, about being his girlfriend \". **for weeks!**\n\n I think perhaps, you and his sibling have tormented him into blowing up, and poor Dana got the backlash.\n\nI think you already got him to apologise to Dana for what he said, and you should accept that you goaded him into it.\n\nHe doubled down, because you bullied him to associating Dana, and girls who look like Dana, with your childish teasing, and at some level, your husband gets it, and wants it dropped.", "There\u2019s a few Ys to go around. Obviously,Andrew\u2019s outburst was just unacceptable but what\u2019s with the teasing? The younger boy might have resorted to it (and should have been firmly reprimanded for it) but dad too? He should be aware as you should be that at Andrew\u2019s age,everything is magnified by fifty. Are we back in the shitty 80s all of a sudden? \n\n NTA for taking Andrew\u2019s words seriously,but YTA for *not* taking the teasing just as much so.", "This is bigger than who is the A. \n\nTalk with your son. \n\nDana doesn't deserve that. \n\nNobody does. \n\nWhere did your son pick up garbage like that at his age?", "NTA. You are right and you're not punishing him for his preference. You're punishing him becayse of his attitude towards black girl. You can not be attracted to someone without acting the way he did. \n\nAnd as a black man I gotta be honest. Take your husband's take with a grain of salt. Puerto Rican people and most people of all racists regardless of if they have experienced racism don't understand the complexities of racism. Especially the more their society values whiteness. Latin and Hispanic communities that are considered black still perform misogynoir let alone if he's a white Puerto Rican. You can recognize the deeper complexities that he writes off. \n\nYou're right, don't let him off it's better to try better his attitude now even if they disagree with you. Even if he doesn't like it, even if he still thinks that way maybe that seed will bloom when he grows enough to understand why this is wrong.", "NTA, you seem like a great mom explaining why you don't say something like that. It seems he's more worried about what people at school think, and with both Dad's backing him up, he feels even more justified. \n\nHaving a dating preference is one thing, but that's definitely not how this came across.", "Your husband and ex are right that he\u2019s allowed to have preferences, but he doesn\u2019t need to make these preferences known to his supposed friend in such a cruel manner. Punishment fits the crime. NTA", "ESH\n\nYou should not be teasing your son about this, he\u2019s obvious sensitive and it\u2019s rude AF.\n\nYour son definitely should not have said what he said.\n\nYeah, everyone just sucks.", "NTA.  He's entitled to his preferences but not to de-humanize another race completely.  My guess is your husband and your ex don't like black girls either.", "NTA, but it would be helpful if you expound on why what he said is a problem. A blanket statement like that suggests that all black women look exactly the same, have the same personality, the same values, etc. It's dehumanizing and reductive. Black women are unique individuals; the only way someone could be sure they would never be interested in any black woman is if they are...I think you can fill it in here. Time to do a deep dive into his social media and figure out where this is coming from.", "I don't think your punishment is bad. He is entitled to have his preferences, but that doesn't mean he has to be a dick about it. I would give some freedoms back due to the apology, but maybe ask him what he thinks about apologizing? Did he do it because after your talk he reflected on it and realized he was being a dick, or did he do it because you're making him. He may think black women are ugly, but there are ways to communicate like this \"I don't find black women attractive\" is majorly different than \"Black women are ugly\" and how we think does effect how we act (I know that sounds weird but go with it). Maybe you could reach out to Dana and get her take? \n\nSomeone else here brought up peer pressure, and god I would hate to see a school where the pressure was to be hateful. Hate is a poison that kills only the one holding on to it, and to have that due to uncontrollable reasons will have it sink further. \n\nNTA.", "NTA he needs to understand how to be polite.  He is allowed preferences.  He should not be allowed to be racist; I don't think he is this is his friend.  You should not try to push a relationship on him though, and your other son should not say things like this is his \"girlfriend\".  It's normal for people to have friends of all genders and skin tones, and he shouldn't have to keep reminding his own family that they are just friends.", "Not at all wrong for punishing him.  But, I think you're sending mixed signals here.\n\nHe deserved to be punished for his outburst, for saying a really shitty thing to Dana.  This is about learning discretion, respect, and diversity.  In short, he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut and not hurt others.\n\nThat said, he should **not** be punished for who he is attracted to.  All of us humans have folks we are more attracted to and folks we are less (or not) attracted to.  For many reasons, not just race.  That is human nature and 110% ok.  You are making a mountain out of a molehill by telling him he needs to read a book on misogynoir.", "NTA, and this wasn't just preference choice, this was a racist comment.  \nThis is 100% a teachable moment.  \nYou can almost always talk about what you do or don't like, without being an ass or a creep.  \nAnd I do mean almost, as I have been involved\\\\witness to a few conversations where person A is interested in person B, but B is not even remotely interested in A and A is pushing for an answer or a date and not accepting a no. That's just a train wreck for everyone.", "Family teases child.  Child acts like child.  Negative results all around.\n\nThis isn't about preferences.  If he said, \"she's not my type\" there would not have been an issue.\n\nAlso none of this would have happened if the parents and by extension the sibling wasn't teasing him.", "Please fix the dynamic of teasing around this relationship. He is at the age where it's tender, he's learning and a bunch of teasing is torture.\n\nIt may be platonic. My best friend was a boy growing up and boy did we get rowed DAILY. It was completely innocent and my best memories.", "ESH.  Your son is 100% wrong in his outburst, and Dana was probably hurt and humiliated.  But you were teasing him--it wasn't just his brother--about her being his girlfriend when it is just as likely that the friendship is platonic.\n\nHe is 14.  Having a girlfriend (or BOYFRIEND) isn't unheard of but it's also not something you should be pushing on him.  A lot of people don't date at 14.\n\nHell, pushing the relationship angle is annoying no matter the age.", "YTA/EHS your family harassed Andrew until he snapped and the only one youre mad at is Andrew.", ">Once she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt Dana\u2019s feelings.\n\nYa think??", "Racism is not a preference. Your son is obviously free to prefer different physical characteristics in girls, but he's way past old enough to know how repulsive it is to shout that out, especially in the presence of the girl herself.\n\nI think you handled this beautifully. NTA.", "NTA. The thing is our preferences don\u2019t just emerge from solely within. There are a host of societal conditions that tell us what is attractive/Beautiful and what is not. Even though there is a lot of variety of facial features and body types, it\u2019s kind of clear that the features that get the most praise are those that are the most closely associated with whiteness. That\u2019s why your son\u2019s outburst is unfortunate. He wasn\u2019t expressing a preference, as many here have stated. He was expressing a prejudice. He needs to unlearn that.\n\nThe men in your life, for reasons I can\u2019t explain here, are simply not the people to ask. They also need to read about Beauty politics, lol.\n\nIt might be helpful for your son if you chose the book.", "NTA Everyone has a type, but the way he said it was just downright mean and racist", "NYA. He was being racist, however he should be allowed to date whoever he likes. He\u2019s allowed to not want to date someone with dark skin so long as he is a good person to them just the same, and still was okay with being around them. His comments sound disgusting.", "NTA.  As I see it, you punished your son for being insensitive (horrible) to a guest and for acting racist, not for having preferences. If a \"preference\" is skin color, that person has a prejudice. Then stating that \"preference\" in racial terms confirms it.\n\nPeople learn racism at home - check on the example your husband and ex are giving your sons. And being part of a group that gets discriminated against doesn't prevent someone from being racist.", "NTA, I would say you are more teaching your kid about being respectfu, rather than misogynoir.\n\nWe all have physical preferences at first for an other person, you can't really blame him as it is somewhat natural. However it is not because someone is \"not your type\" that you can't be friends with this person. Sadly being in high school surrounded by lot of immature teenagers, added with the social pressure I would not be surprised he is being bugged. \n\nYou should also try to make him understand how saddened her friend must have been to receive such comments, specially coming from her \"friend\".\n\nYou kid definitely owes Dana an apology.", "NTA: He was cruel and awful to Dana. Honestly, I would have defended her more vehemently right in front of her. He was a terrible friend. He can have his preferences but his attitudes are racist.", "You're kinda sending mixed signals here, but NTA\n\nHe should absolutely be punished for hurting Dana's feelings. He's 14, so he was probably embarrassed and didn't know how to deal with the teasing, but that was inappropriate.\n\nHowever, he shouldn't be punished for having a preference. Trying to change who he finds attractive is wrong.\n\nHe should be punished for his outburst, *not* for having a preference.", "I don't think you're the AH for punishing him for his outburst. There is NO reason him embarrassing Dana would ever be okay, but your find appealing what you find appealing. I know white guys who DON'T like white girls, you can't really pick what you find attractive I don't think.", "I don\u2019t think the issue is that he has this preference. We cannot help what we like. I think the issue is that saying what he said in a generalized negative way about a certain race of people, whoever they are , is unnecessary , offensive because it\u2019s an insult, and ultimately is discrimination.  It would be rude to say he thought all tall people were ugly and saying that in front of a tall person would be very offensive to that person, and also generalizations like that really are not accurate and are hurtful.  It\u2019s his expression of his preference that is the real issue not so much the preference alone.  He basically called his friend ugly right to her face at the dinner table and whatever reason he said that it\u2019s still rude and should not have been said it\u2019s really really rude. I don\u2019t know if I would make this too much about race because I think that\u2019s just a small part of this .  I\u2019d say more it is discrimination and it was a rude comment regardless of why he said it.

It won\u2019t work. Those books have EXACTLY the same narration and pushy attitude as people around him.

That's pressure, and it will make a kid say stupid things. You should have done more to understand why he said that, as opposed to just dumping guilt all over him like that. \n\nAdditionally, it feels weird to bring up the fact that he wasn't taking into account the other half of her race. I don't know how that's important and it seems to imply that her being half asian is better than being full black. Which, if he is racist, would maybe explain where it came from.", "Yes, that pretty much sums up racism. Making her a victim in his eyes when it wasn't about that. His preference sounds like not black/Vietnamese girls, which is fine. Yet you went straight to the victimizing scenario and created an issue where there was none. Making it about race on any one single instance is what keeps it in the minds of people.

You sound like a pervert.  \nLast, a 11 years old doesn't have the mental capacity to disguise their feelings like an adult used to political correctness.

My 14 year old is the subject of this post. I\u2019ll call him Andrew.\n\nAndrew has recently begun his first year of high school. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends because we live closer to a different high school than most of his former classmates ended up at. Luckily one of his very close friends from a few years back goes to his school. A girl I will call D. They have become close again over the last 6ish weeks. They spend time together at school and she has been coming over on weekends, or him at her house. Andrew talks about her a lot. To be honest, I thought they had crushes on each other. By the way, D is mixed black with Vietnamese and we are white. Unfortunately that is relevant. \n\nLast weekend D was over for dinner. Things were going normally until my 11 year old made a joke about D being Andrew\u2019s girlfriend. My husband and he have been lightly teasing Andrew for a couple of weeks about D being his girlfriend and he always denies it hotly. That night after my 11 year old\u2019s joke, Andrew not only denied it but spouted a, \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE BLACK GIRLS!\u201d loudly for the entire table to hear, including D. I was stunned. D looked highly embarrassed. I knew in the moment I would talk to him later, but just for the time being said something like, \u201chey, that isn\u2019t cool.\u201d The remainder of dinner was very awkward and then D left.\n\nOnce she was gone I told Andrew how he probably hurt D\u2019s feelings. I explained how black women and girls already struggle with feeling accepted in society, and that he was ignoring the other half of her race entirely. Not to mention the bad example he was setting for his brother. He went on defensive mode and said he just thinks dark girls are \u201cugly\u201d and is tired of people at home and at school thinking he would date, \u201csomeone like her.\u201d After that conversation I told him that he was grounded until he offered D a sincere apology and made an effort to learn about miogynoir through reading. I then told him that if I were D, I would not want to be his friend anymore after his racist remarks. \n\nTo my astonishment, this has been unpopular with my ex as well as my current husband. My current husband is puerto rican, so I was doubly surprised he didn\u2019t side with me. They both say that Andrew is entitled to his own preferences when it comes to girls and I am wrong to punish him. I took it more seriously from my current husband who has been on the receiving end of racism. I now do not know what to do. Andrew has apologized to D, but has yet to find a good book on misogynoir and read it. Am I wrong for punishing him? Should I let him off the hook? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's another to blurt it out in a way that hurts someone's feelings like that. This is what I would focus on.\n\nPeople's preferences change over time. It's also the case that the whole concept of race is pretty artificial. There's a HUGE variation in skin tone, facial features and body types for each nationality and so-called race. It's more a self-assigned cultural designation than a physical type.\n\nI think it's a LOT to ask for someone his age to get into the details of a book about misogynoir as such. Maybe a better choice would be to find books about racial struggles from the standpoint of someone his age. That way he gets a broader understanding about what it's like for someone who's in a minority and hopefully learn empathy.\n\nThere's some good books available for school kids these days on that.

Your son however, is very much TA. It's okay to have preferences and to not be attracted to certain physical features, including skin tone/ethnicity. What is not okay is to just say it in the way he said it, completely disregarding her feelings and possibly making her feel less than just because of her ethnicity which is absolutely unacceptable. He could have simply said \"I don't feel that way about her, we are just friends\" and that would be enough of an explanation. Sure, being rejected that way hurts but it's not nearly as bad as dismissing an entire group of people just because they happened to be born with a darker skin tone. It's bad enough that the beauty industry and media has been whitewashed for so long, no need to add to it. That's the kind of stuff that he should just keep to himself and find other reasons to decline someone's advances if they happen to hit on him and not fit his preferences. The other thing is that it's not okay to only be nice / respectful to people he finds attractive and to be mean to all others. This is a very common issue among men, and it needs to stop. There is also a huge difference between saying \"I am not attracted to x group of people\" and saying \"x group of people are ugly\".

He could have done so much better on denying whatever happens to him with her, but...\n\nPlease, take into account all the signs around this situation. It's not OK punishing him for his preferences, in case he was telling the truth. You will only make him resent more the whole situation. And I want to make perfectly clear that you acted the way you should about the way he expressed it, he should never talk the way he did about anyone or to anyone, but extending the punishment and making it about his preferences would do more harm.\n\nOn the other hand, you don't know if the teasing comes only from your other son and your husband. I have the feeling something else is going on here that goes beyond his true feelings about the girl. Maybe he heard someone at school saying something about it. Maybe he thinks people will judge him if they find out he likes her and the teasing in your house only makes him feel worst.\n\nHave an honest chat with him. Make him know it is safe to express whatever happens to you and act according to that. Do not judge him. Do not think bad of him. Right now, you are showing he can't trust you with his feelings or with his preferences because you will punish him if you don't agree. Teach him to express in a better and healthier way. And talk to your other son and husband and teach them not to mock others just because of their feelings or relationships.\n\nYou have a window of opportunity here. You can come closer to your son and teach him a lot of things. You can teach him it's OK to talk to you if he is having trouble, you can teach him he can talk to you if he needs advice. You can teach him that no matter what, he has your full support. You can teach him it is OK to being wrong as long as he can feel regret and make things right. And you can teach him it's OK if he likes asian girls or blondes or redheads or muslims or whatever as long as he treats them with respect and he is happy. Or you can punish him and make sure he will resent this situation and whenever he needs to talk to someone about something he thinks you are not gonna like, then he will not going to talk to you and will receive any (probably) shitty advice from someone else.", "NTA.

Whether or not Andrew wants to date Dana, or be open to dating certain people is his business, but I think you definitely did the right thing by disciplining him. I think requiring him to research and read up on \"Misogynoir\" is a big overstep and pretty cringe.

Your bad assumptions made you complicit in allowing  the bullying his father and brother were doing. All of this combined sends a message to your 14year old that his emotions do not matter. FFS this is how we get incels. We teach men they can't just be friends with girls and that the only way they can have any emotion is sexual ones. Weither he has a crush on her or not does not matter.

He may have lashed out in a spectacular fashion to try and shut down the teasing from the family (which apparently has been going on for a while, and also seems to occur at school) - but the \\*way\\* that he said it may have cost him a good friend (who has every right to be offended - no-one really likes to hang out with a person who thinks they're ugly). Naturally, if he continues to speak like this, this will have repercussions on his educational prospects and professional life.\n\nNow the issue with what the poster above suggested about pressuring him \"even if he doesn't like it\" - you don't have any back-up. At best, your boy may just simply ignore you because the male figures in his life are telling him that he's correct - at worst, he may do the opposite of what you say completely and fall into a deeper rabbit hole.
