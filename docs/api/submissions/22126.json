But I would think having a child at 17 maybe ages you a bit or forces you to grow up quickly (in fact, maybe her parents specifically began giving her more responsibilities than they would have otherwise). So perhaps there is some truth to your cousin not exactly being \"the same\" as you or treated the same.  While I don't think this should be offensive to YOU (it honestly seems more offensive, or I guess \"sad reality\" is the better term, for your cousin...?), sounds like fam should cut the crap either way, because comparing people's life situations is bound to hurt SOMEone. You're both very young and should both be seen as having a lot of potential and life and growth ahead .

Usually that's just meant for the younger members of the family. Your cousin's probably pretty sensitive about being a young mom, since she's likely worried that her child's going to suffer for it. I became a mom at 22, and that was always a concern of mine - and in a way, it DID force me to grow up faster than my peers, as there was suddenly another person depending on me for everything. It's scary, it's overwhelming, and it forces you into another perspective. I would suggest trying to let some of the 'youngest' comments go and instead focus on your goals and plans for your life. Good luck this fall, and enjoy college!", "Mehhhhhhhhh....I really don't see why you wanted to \"correct\" your uncle by pointing out that cousin is a year younger than you.

You didn't need to bring your cousin into the convo at all and draw comparisons....no one else was.\n\nAlso consider that this was an event to celebrate your accomplishments, you were not being insulted, but you still felt the need to point out that your cousin is \"in the same place in life\" as you even though she isn't moving out and doesn't have a degree, while these are both things you're doing.

She has had to step up and be responsible for another human in a way you have never had to do. \n\nShe has had to navigate complex adult relationships and situations, like co-parenting with her ex, romantic relationships, and asserting her position of authority with her parents regarding her son. Which you have never done.\n\nShe is socially, romantically, and cultural milestones older than you in terms of life experiences. \n\nUntil you experience something which comes with the same degree of personal responsibility and accountability as a kid, such as you start and pull off a passion project company, they're unlikely to view you on the same level.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t need to bring your cousin into the conversation at all.

This kind of persecution complex screams immaturity so I'm guessing that is what they are responding too. I think what is really happening is you are envious of the attention and support your cousin and her son get so you are lashing out at any perceived slight. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but being responsible for another human is perceived as maturing her because it is. Bearing the burden of parenthood is absolutely a maturing experience as what mature people do is not just focus on their own growth but help others to grow as well.

You haven't had to deal with a dependent or anything like that.   You're an adult, but an adult that's still shifting to be on your own over time.   \n\nYour uncle was wrong to call you the baby, but you are the one with the least forced responsibilities.  You've got to get used to that.  As the \"not-youngest with no kids\" person myself, you just got to realize they're going to make comments like that for ***years***.   Stop comparing yourself to others when you don't want to be compared.

I just wrote a page and you\u2019d already said it so well and simply. Doh! Lol", "Right? It'd be like people saying was immature for turn girls down until after I turned 18 because I did not to get someone pregnant while I was still in high school.\n\n\nWhat a dumb take.", "> You\u2019re reading things into the comment. Imo being a single mother at 19 does show immaturity, you don\u2019t get into that situation without making some mistakes (pregnant too early, relationship not stable, not enough life experience, possibly sex without precaution at a young age).\n\n5% of all teenage births are a result of rape and around half of teenage pregnancies occur from adult men as old as 27.\n\nLet's not ignore the nuance of violence and abuse against women please. While I don't know if this is OP's cousin's situation, you can't narrow down all cases of single teen moms to \"being irresponsible\".", "My friend's daughter had a baby at 16, got a full time job and got her GED. Then when she was 18, she moved out, got married and had 5 other kids, while holding down a job and going to college. She graduated from college and works fulltime in her chosen career and is expecting a 7th baby. She's a really good mom.\nHer dad died 3 years ago and her mom was looking for a distraction from her grief, so offered to watch all her grandbabies. Her daughter insisted on paying her at least half of what she did at the day care. \nHer mom needed the money.", "I think there's a transition back to \"oh shit\" at about age 45 or so.", "Good luck.\n\nGet a full hysterectomy and maybe they'll only nag you to adopt.", "Same!  I never got \"baby fever\" when I was young, and I certainly don't have it now in my early 50's.", "44 and I do get kitten fever though!", "Oh if only that was a guarantee.", "Childless always sounds really sad to me. Like someone who wants children but can't have them.", "Eh, it would come in handy on dating profiles and such, where life choices and important opinions need to be communicated with a character limit.", "Save the whales, but nuke the seals lol", "My friend was very responsible as a teenager. She and her partner used condoms and she was on the Pill. The unintended result of her responsibility is now a fully grown Primary school  teacher and getting married in her own right.\n\nContraception fails. It's not necessarily any lack of precaution on the young person's part that a pregnancy occurs. \n\nI always think the only difference between her and me was dumb luck. But our (rural, religious, conservative) community viewed us very differently just because my sexual activity didn't result in any offspring until after marriage. \n\nI think taking any moral judgement against teenagers who get pregnant is wrong.\n\nYes, some of then are raped, some of them are exploited by older men\n\nand some of them are just doing what a lot of us do at that age, fucking our first partner(s) like horny rabbits (with contraceptives) and some of us get the consequence and some of us get off scot-free", "I know lots of kids now who are at different stages of life who are only here because of my friends' contraceptive failure.\n\nOne friend had her tubes tied, got pregnant after and discovered it was ectopic, lost both pregnancy and one ovary,  nearly died and when she stabilised was assured that the other tubal ligation was sound and no further pregnancies would occur but then got pregnant again *the next month*. \n\nTubal ligation is generally seen as pretty foolproof....", "Birth control isn't 100%. My 2nd son is proof.", "5% of all teenage pregnancies are from a result of rape.", "That's... Fair. Yeah.", "Yes that is true. OP doesn't say the cousin is a bad parent, only that she has some help by living with parents.", "I also love how in other people's eyes, this makes *us* the selfish ones!\n\nYeah, I don't want to bring an innocent being into a universe with global warming, ridiculous inflation, career stagnation, no affordable housing but yeah, sorry, my bad, I'm clearly the selfish one!", "For the mom, you may have a point. Getting pregnant may prove difficult in that situation though\n\n*ducks*", "And I *like* sleep and I *do not like* screaming or changing diapers", "It is, isn't it? I get home from work, take a 2-3 hour nap, then pop up, clean and make dinner, and work on personal projects until the AM.", "I left out the word \"not\". OPs post is NOT about who is more mature, it is about if they are in the same place in life. No they are not", "Also 42. Wasn't dead against it when I was younger but was too busy being a practicing alcoholic. Now am recovering alcoholic and learning to be happy with myself. In the years in between, it just didn't happen. And the one time I came close, the circumstances weren't aligned. Now the thought of kids just sounds so exhausting.\n\nBesides, I don't want to share my Lego with kids...", "Hahaha. That\u2019s what I meant", "You are so right. There are hardly any kids being abused because of the stress of being a parent."]}
