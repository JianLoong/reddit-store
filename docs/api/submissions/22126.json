But I would think having a child at 17 maybe ages you a bit or forces you to grow up quickly (in fact, maybe her parents specifically began giving her more responsibilities than they would have otherwise). So perhaps there is some truth to your cousin not exactly being \"the same\" as you or treated the same.  While I don't think this should be offensive to YOU (it honestly seems more offensive, or I guess \"sad reality\" is the better term, for your cousin...?), sounds like fam should cut the crap either way, because comparing people's life situations is bound to hurt SOMEone. You're both very young and should both be seen as having a lot of potential and life and growth ahead .

Usually that's just meant for the younger members of the family. Your cousin's probably pretty sensitive about being a young mom, since she's likely worried that her child's going to suffer for it. I became a mom at 22, and that was always a concern of mine - and in a way, it DID force me to grow up faster than my peers, as there was suddenly another person depending on me for everything. It's scary, it's overwhelming, and it forces you into another perspective. I would suggest trying to let some of the 'youngest' comments go and instead focus on your goals and plans for your life. Good luck this fall, and enjoy college!", "Mehhhhhhhhh....I really don't see why you wanted to \"correct\" your uncle by pointing out that cousin is a year younger than you.

You didn't need to bring your cousin into the convo at all and draw comparisons....no one else was.\n\nAlso consider that this was an event to celebrate your accomplishments, you were not being insulted, but you still felt the need to point out that your cousin is \"in the same place in life\" as you even though she isn't moving out and doesn't have a degree, while these are both things you're doing.

She has had to step up and be responsible for another human in a way you have never had to do. \n\nShe has had to navigate complex adult relationships and situations, like co-parenting with her ex, romantic relationships, and asserting her position of authority with her parents regarding her son. Which you have never done.\n\nShe is socially, romantically, and cultural milestones older than you in terms of life experiences. \n\nUntil you experience something which comes with the same degree of personal responsibility and accountability as a kid, such as you start and pull off a passion project company, they're unlikely to view you on the same level.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t need to bring your cousin into the conversation at all.

This kind of persecution complex screams immaturity so I'm guessing that is what they are responding too. I think what is really happening is you are envious of the attention and support your cousin and her son get so you are lashing out at any perceived slight. \n\nI'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but being responsible for another human is perceived as maturing her because it is. Bearing the burden of parenthood is absolutely a maturing experience as what mature people do is not just focus on their own growth but help others to grow as well.

That's just the default.  You ***shouldn't*** have any kids yet at that age.  You need time to get your life together first.  \n\nHonestly, you do need to recognize that you're just 20.  You haven't had to deal with a dependent or anything like that.   You're an adult, but an adult that's still shifting to be on your own over time.   \n\nYour uncle was wrong to call you the baby, but you are the one with the least forced responsibilities.  You've got to get used to that.  As the \"not-youngest with no kids\" person myself, you just got to realize they're going to make comments like that for ***years***.   Stop comparing yourself to others when you don't want to be compared.  It'll only hurt you long term.  \n\nIf they keep acting like this after you're out of college and have your own place ***then*** push back.

Yeah those things are super nice. Sorry you fucked up your life and don\u2019t get them. \ud83d\ude01", "Because if they treated cousin as if she was older (and this wasn\u2019t just a dumb mistake over birth order / their perception as OP as one of the younger cousins) they would\u2019ve said \u201cwell she has a kid\u201d when OP pointed out that her cousin is actually the youngest.", "Lmao ok. Y'all are really dedicated to inferring shit in this story that's not there.", "Then they would\u2019ve said something that actually implies that they thought cousin had more life experience than OP when OP pointed out that she isn\u2019t actually the youngest (such as cousin having a kid). They didn\u2019t.", "Unless you prefer to simply remain an irresponsible child yourself and let others pick up your slack. Or keep doing crack. Either or.  \n\n\nAlmost like the people who take responsibility already were responsible and are continuing this trend and irresponsible people won't magically become responsible.\n\nThe idea that a kid makes you more of an adult needs to be smothered in its sleep", "It takes nothing but sex without protection to make a baby and foolishness to keep it at 17 without a plan or huge support. I don\u2019t know why people think having children gets them extra credit in life\n\nIt takes a great deal of maturity to know that you shouldn\u2019t be a parent as a teenager and whatever arrangements you make to stop that from happening is a choice you made.", "They're both adults, that's the point. Being child-free doesn't make you younger than someone 2 years younger than you.\n\n> Getting a toddler to put on shoes \n\nI suppose that means the majority of elder siblings have the maturity of grown adults then, regardless of their age.", "It's not, and nobody's saying so.\n\nBy the same token, merely *birthing* children does not inherently make one an adult or \"mature\".", "They did. That's the post", "> They never stated or implied that cousin isn't younger than her. \n\nWhat do you think \"baby\" means?", "Baby typically refers to the youngest person. My 26 year old sister will always be the baby.", "Yes they did, that\u2019s the whole point of the post. They implied it by the uncle saying saying OP is the baby of the family (= the youngest) though cousin is 2 yrs younger.", "They did.   Did you not read it?", "No, it\u2019s absolutely there. And we pointed out why. When you say \u201cbaby of the family\u201d this means the youngest person. Cousin is 2 yrs younger. It\u2019s not that complicated, even if you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) see it.\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason why you\u2019re being downvoted.", "Can you point out where anyone in the family argued that OP's cousin is more mature/older/has more life experience than her?", "Then why didn\u2019t her family say \u201cshe has a kid\u201d when OP pointed out that cousin is younger than her? I just read it as a stupid mistake over birth order (19 and 20 isn\u2019t a big age gap) and when OP said she wasn\u2019t actually the youngest, all her mom did was list reasons why they perceive her as a baby. NOT why they perceive her as a baby INSTEAD OF HER COUSIN."]}
