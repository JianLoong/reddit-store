You're making very mature and responsible choices, and seem to have a very positive life trajectory lined up.

I'm 28 & my husband and I chose not to have children. We are still told after 8 years of marriage that we will \"change our minds\" and we just haven't found \"the right person\" yet. We're hopelessly in love and very serious about no kids.

That's not your fault, though.", "NTA, and it's especially annoying to be belittled for taking the more mature path.", "NTA - your family sound like idiots", "Certainly if you were both in your late 20s and one of you was a \"baby\" simply because you didnt have a baby, that'd be ridiculous.  But I would think having a child at 17 maybe ages you a bit or forces you to grow up quickly (in fact, maybe her parents specifically began giving her more responsibilities than they would have otherwise). So perhaps there is some truth to your cousin not exactly being \"the same\" as you or treated the same.  While I don't think this should be offensive to YOU (it honestly seems more offensive, or I guess \"sad reality\" is the better term, for your cousin...?), sounds like fam should cut the crap either way, because comparing people's life situations is bound to hurt SOMEone. You're both very young and should both be seen as having a lot of potential and life and growth ahead .

I don't think they were really being mean in any way. You have a point that yes she is younger and is in the same boat as you, but she does have a kid so she does have more life experience than you. Don't worry about comparing yourself to anyone. You chose your life path for a reason, and in the end it will probably be for the best not to have kids at 19.", "Oh my god we found the secret of eternal youth! Never marry or have a kid! NTA being a single mom at 19 don't make you more mature...", "Nta. At this point in your life your child free. You're taking precautions to stay that way.", "NTA - that's all super weird on your family's end.

However, you need to realize that the two of you AREN'T in the same place in life. Neither of you are in a better or worse place than the other, but it's still different, as you're heading for a 4-year college program and she's raising a child.\n\nYour family definitely shouldn't be infantilizing you, but I do think you took a 'baby of the family' comment a little too much to heart. Usually that's just meant for the younger members of the family. Your cousin's probably pretty sensitive about being a young mom, since she's likely worried that her child's going to suffer for it. I became a mom at 22, and that was always a concern of mine - and in a way, it DID force me to grow up faster than my peers, as there was suddenly another person depending on me for everything. It's scary, it's overwhelming, and it forces you into another perspective. I would suggest trying to let some of the 'youngest' comments go and instead focus on your goals and plans for your life. Good luck this fall, and enjoy college!", "Mehhhhhhhhh....I really don't see why you wanted to \"correct\" your uncle by pointing out that cousin is a year younger than you. I don't think he meant anything nasty by referring to you as \"the baby of the family\" if you're the second-youngest cousin and you don't have a literal baby yourself.\n\nIt has nothing to do with you being \"childfree\" (most 20 year olds are childfree!) and probably more to do with the fact that your cousin is raising a literal baby, and yes, people perceive parents differently. But you aren't being infantilized simply by being called the baby of the family. You didn't need to bring your cousin into the convo at all and draw comparisons....no one else was.\n\nAlso consider that this was an event to celebrate your accomplishments, you were not being insulted, but you still felt the need to point out that your cousin is \"in the same place in life\" as you even though she isn't moving out and doesn't have a degree, while these are both things you're doing. It seems like you're just trying to rub it in. Idk, maybe you didn't mean it that way, I just don't understand why you brought cousin up anyway in this situation.", "YTA.\n\nYour mom was attacking you, and instead of defending yourself, you attacked your cousin in return.\n\nYou should have defended yourself directly, not tried to turn your mom's attack around onto somebody else.  If you can't refute your mother's statements directly, reflect on why that is.", "NAH you are both the same age and I don't think you should be treated differently but having a child does mature you more quickly.", "YTA. You are not at the same place in life\u2014she is responsible for another person and you are not.", "NTA. You are obviously more mature than her as you have put thought into not fucking up your life by having a baby you aren\u2019t prepared for.", "NAH\n\nThey have a point. She has had to step up and be responsible for another human in a way you have never had to do. \n\nShe has had to navigate complex adult relationships and situations, like co-parenting with her ex, romantic relationships, and asserting her position of authority with her parents regarding her son. Which you have never done.\n\nShe is socially, romantically, and cultural milestones older than you in terms of life experiences. \n\nUntil you experience something which comes with the same degree of personal responsibility and accountability as a kid, such as you start and pull off a passion project company, they're unlikely to view you on the same level.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t need to bring your cousin into the conversation at all. Sounds like you\u2019re the one who compares y\u2019all, not the rest of your family.", "ESH - This was not exactly the best way to prove how mature you are.", "YTA. Your cousin had nothing to do with this and you purposefully brought her into it. You should apologize to her. \n\nWith your attitude, I highly doubt it's been your choice not to date anyone", "Actually YTA. You didn\u2019t need to say all that in front of her since she didn\u2019t attack you. It\u2019s rude. \n\nNAH. I\u2019d say NTA in a few years.
