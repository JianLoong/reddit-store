I agree 100% that he should've been told that the kid was signed up for XYZ and where to go, but the timing part seems to not matter.", "yes, I came here a bit judgemental, true, but after reading the whole post OP can say like informing me or something , i feel like the words OP chose for the title is a bit too strong. and this is AITA, sorry for being judgemental, I am here to judge people lol.\nalas now I'm also being judged too.", "It came up naturally before that point. In my kids\u2019 case, signing up for the activity and starting the activity were several weeks apart.", "Oh yeah.", "First off, I do not disagree with the parent comment of this thread. And I agree with you as a whole that OP has a general tone of \"Neener Neener I'm right.\" I think OP has an unpleasant attitude problem.\n\nThat said, OP didn't tell his wife those words that prompted my reply, so it's not useful to anyone to treat the tone of that quote as if that's what he said to her. The actual exchange was:\n\n>She said \"oh so I need permission to sign our son up for Legos.\" I said check yourself and just admit you were wrong. Next time you think of signing him up for something, you let me know. You're not a single mother and I actually do far more childcare than you anyways. Give me the respect I give you. Goodnight. \n\nShe was not being constructive, but made up a strawman to avoid the problem. His potentially being an argumentative person at his core doesn't change that. She needs to acknowledge his point, which is a sound one. Otherwise, again, this kind of issue will happen later. So yes, his wanting her to acknowledge his point is critical for handling this situation. Otherwise they're just being upset with each other to no benefit. So his general stance of 'I am willing to move on, but want her to admit she was wrong' is correct and constructive to their situation: she needs to communicate better.", "It doesn't. No one is making anything up. They are reading OP's words.", "He refuted one minor thing out of everything I said. That suggests that I was spot on with my comment.", "*\"the person responsible for picking-up the child needs to know where the child will be and at the appropriate time.\"*\n\nYeah, I agree. That's why I said twice in my original post and a third time in my response to you that she should have made him aware that the kid was in a Lego club.\n\nAnd also yes, attacking her role as a mother and stating \"I do more parenting than you\" is childish. That's not asking for \"basic human respect.\" That's being intentionally hurtful.\n\nAnd I never said the wife was free of blame. In truth, ESH, but the wife sucking does not change my opinion that OP was at least AN asshole in this situation.", "That is true. But the way he said he was unhappy kind of facilitated a shut down on her part.", "It isn't a different pick up time. See the bottom of the original post: his class ends at the same time.", ">The yard aide didn't know where the child was. For a few minutes, OP was worried that the absolutely worst had happened to his son. \n\nThis is not in the post. I get that you really need a villain, but what OP actually said was that the Aide directed him to a couple of classrooms and told him that after school classes had started this week. There was no mention of worrying that \"the absolute worst\" had happened.", "How do you miss shit like that?  Are you reading every other sentence?", "especially if the kid wasn't there when the aide started working.", "I understand, my comment was in response to the statement that \u201cEveryone knew where the kid was\u2026\u201d the word everyone was completely off base. Three maybe four adults knew. The child\u2019s classroom teacher, the teacher in charge of the Lego class, the mom, and maybe someone in admin. The rest of the staff might know the legos class exists but they certainly don\u2019t have the roster for every single after school class memorized.", "\u201cI sense this is not about the Lego class\u201d\n\nWhat do you call that? A spidey sense?\n\n\u201cThere seems to be more going on in your relationship and maybe a power struggle\u201d\n\nFor someone accusing me of not being able to read, your literacy is off the charts", "Can\u2019t be spot on if even one part is wrong mate.", "No the club starts the same time his class ends so ig its \n\nMaths from 13:00 to 14:00 \n\nThan it's lego club from 14:00 to XX:XX", "I have ADHD and occasionally skim read when I'm tired without realising.", "\"His class ends at the same time I pick him up\".\n\nThat's the quote.", "About when his dad picks him up as in **his school classes** \n\nI gotta know is english your 1st language or do you lack compression skills?", "You're wrong, and the context is clear and obvious. It's also clear and obvious that you just want to argue, so goodbye."]}
