Since I WFH, I pick him up based on all that.\n\nToday I went to pick up my son and he wasn't on the yard as expected. I asked a yard aide who said to check a couple of classrooms because they started after-school classes this week. I didn't know this.\n\nSure enough, there's my son in a Lego engineering class. I asked him what he was doing there and he said it was his first day. I said no one signed you up. He said my wife did.\n\nAfter I got him bathed and put him to bed, I asked my wife if she signed him up for this Lego class. She said yes and it's Wednesday and Friday. I said you didn't tell me. She said she didn't think she had to tell me. Our son wanted to sign up, she signed him up. His class ends at the same time I pick him up and she paid for it.\n\nI said, again, you should had told me. No one knew where he was and what you did was rude. She said \"oh so I need permission to sign our son up for Legos.\" I said check yourself and just admit you were wrong. Next time you think of signing him up for something, you let me know. You're not a single mother and I actually do far more childcare than you anyways. Give me the respect I give you. Goodnight. \n\nI can get over it but I'd like her to acknowledge my point.

That's something she made up because it's easier to attack than your actual request, which is basic communication.\n\nIt's also humiliating to you and making you look like the \"doofus dad\" that doesn't bother paying attention if you show up to school and have no idea where your kid is and what's he's doing.", "NTA. You\u2019re not asking to give someone permission. You\u2019re asking to know where your son will be after school release. A simply \u201chey, I\u2019m signing Joey up for underwater basket weaving, release is still at the same time as usual\u201d  I work from home and I do pick ups more often than my husband but I still tell him *where our kids will be*. \n\nIs there something else your wife\u2019s mad at bc this is insanity.", "Im gonna go with NTA because your wife is being childish. That is absolutely something she needs to communicate about, especially if you are the one who is expected to pick him up. I dont understand her reasoning for expecting you to know where he was or why she started making decisions that affect everyone by herself. There needs to be communication.", "NTA for the issue at hand - it\u2019s totally reasonable to expect communication around those things, especially if you\u2019re the one in charge of pick-ups. Your wife doesn\u2019t need permission; she just needs to extend the courtesy of keeping you informed. \n\nBut there\u2019s clearly a lot more conflict going on than just what happened today.", "You have the right to be on page and/or consulted, but I can't help but noticing the way you write everything. There seems to be more going on in your relationship and some kind of power struggle. i.e. \"Joke's on her because our 8yo asked me sleep in his room tonight anyway\" it's not a sentence I could fathom my adult partner formulating. Also the thing you slipped about you putting more work in the daycare and having to mention \"after I bathed and put him to bad\". I sense this is not about the Lego class. If you have frustrations, and you may rightfully have them, you should have a deeper and more open talk with your wife instead of fighting over single issues as they emerge.", "NTA. Wife is using a straw man to try to win the argument. You asked her to inform you, she transmuted that to she needs your permission.", "NTA-She doesn\u2019t need your permission this is true but you both need to know what your son is doing and when. That means she needs to communicate with you before any decisions for your son are made unless it\u2019s a genuine emergency.", "NTA. Communication should never stop being a part of a relationship especially regarding your minor child. What if the aide knew nothing about that class and you ended up using emergency resources that turned out to be unnecessary?", "NTA.  This isn't about permission? More like common courtesy.  I can only imagine what I'd feel like if my kid was missing and I had no idea where he was. You're wife is being ridiculous and is showing zero understanding for how this was a scary moment for you, nor does she respect your time.  Who doesn't let there partner know that they don't have to pick their kid at this x time, because their in a class until y time? Meaning the first trip to the school was a waste of time all because couldn't be bothered to tell you about an activity your son is enrolled in?  One that directly impacts you because it changes the time you pick him up? Yep, she whack.", "Info:  Who drops him off at school?", "So, do you normally \u201cbathe\u201d your 8-year-old and sleep in his room when he asks? Both of these are things one would expect him to do on his own \u2014I\u2019m leaning toward troll.", "NTA, your wife is being pretty lousy here. Her entire argument is just non sense she is making up to avoid admitting minor fault. Is she like this in everything?", "NTA. Even if she was doing full time childcare, it basic common sense to inform the other parent of after school activities", "ESH. This whole argument is petty and pointless, born from nothing.\n\nYou didn't found your son, asked, they pointed you in the right direction, he was there, chilling. Not unsupervised, not hurt. Zero problems.\n\nYour wife could have just said \"yeah I forgot sorry\", instead chose to make an argument of it and a hill to die on. Just as you did.", "NTA. It was about communication, not permission. How the hell can you pick up your kid without knowing where they are? Doesn't make sense. \n\nHeck I am a single parent and tell my kid's father if I sign them up for something.", "Your demeanor towards your wife is alarming.\n\nYou're NTA for expecting her to communicate with you but the way to talk about her tells me you both have communication issues.", "NTA, your wife is being childish and irresponsible.", "ESH\n\nIt's like you were looking for a reason to blow up, found one, and let your wife have both barrels. You could have easily come at that situation with a kind request to let you know about classes because you were concerned when he wasn't where he was supposed to be and you'd like to know these things since you're the one picking him up.

Or do you think you should be informed if she makes any decision? You will be completely right for the 2nd one and you will be an AH for first one. Yes there are lots of issues where joint decision is necessary. But joining lego engineering class is not one of those. She should have informed you once she enrolled your kid. Also, even if your kid love you more for NOW, you should not show this off to your wife. Kids are very smart to sense this and manipulate this in their favor.", "ESH\n\nYou for wanting to pick a fight (why?) since it was all about 'you will inform me.....' rather than I need to know what time and where to pick up my son'\n\nHer for switching the dialogue (probably due to the tenor of your demand) into 'so I need to ask permission...'", "Nta she\u2019s confusing permission and communication. But the way you responded to her makes me think this is a relationship issue not just this specific problem", "NTA. You'd think she would want to tell you just because your son is interested. Don't you talk to each other? It's not asking permission, just keeping informed. My husband and I have a shared calendar where all the kids stuff goes so we can plan.

Your wife is the total AH in this situation.", "NTA.  She doesn\u2019t have to ask your permission, just keep you informed. How would she have reacted if the positions were reversed?", "NTA\n\nFor a brief second, you thought your son was lost. If you, or anyone, are picking him up, they need to know where he is. It\u2019s not about permission. You just need to know where he is. And what if the class ended earlier than the time you normally pick him up? Would she get mad you picked him up late? Communication doesn\u2019t mean permission.", "NTA.  I really hope that that this is a one-time slipup by your wife.  Do not apologize, it will just reinforce her need to be right.  I think that you made an excellent point in your post.  She is not a single parent, but she wants all of the perks that come with having sole custody while also getting the benefits of having a second parent.  Does your wife exhibit similar behavior in other areas of your relationship?  If this is a one-off, you can probably talk it out.  If this her normal behavior, I would recommend couples counselling (and possibly individual counseling).", "NTA. You guys are parents, you are supposed to be on the same page about what your kid is up to.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t the fact she signed him up for something that ends the same time as normal or even afterward.

You are correct of course in saying your wife should let you know when she signs the kid up for things so you know where he is, you probably could\u2019ve handled the conversation with your wife in a less aggressive way, no reason to be condescending and tell your wife to check herself, realistically you both should be apologizing to eachother.", "NTA. You need a family calendar - either a shared app or a physical one hung in an easy to use place. Note upcoming events including after school stuff for each family member, preferably with times. My family have had a shared Google calendar for the household for years. Even our son and his gf, when they lived with us while they were at university, used it. And with kids now grown and flown, we still use it for the two of us.", "Knowing where your child will be is bare minimum communication expected between parents.

When you pick up our son today, he will be in Legos instead of the playground.  He wanted to do that, and it sounded like a good opportunity.", "ESH. You are fighting over Lego class. She obviously forgot to tell you and should just say that. People forget. Is this the behavior you want to teach your child? Move on.", "permission? no. heads up to the one picking him up? YES SIR.

However how you speak of your wife is pretty gross. There is way more to this than just her not telling you she signed your son up for Lego engineering.", "ESH.\n\nShe should keep you informed.

Yeah, she probably should have let him know, \"pick son up from lego class today\" but this dude is blowing up over nothing.", "Why he should refrase? Like he said, she isn't a single mom and he h\u00e1s the right to expect her to talk to him before sign his kid up for extracurriculars...", "yes it always seems to me most people care more about making their case than about their relationship.", "You also didn't say \"how dare you,\" but for some reason the caps made you defend raising your voice and nothing else. My guess is you overreact a lot.", "If you don't think his comments escalated the situation, I probably can't help you understand it.", "Nowhere near everyone. The child\u2019s teacher and the one running the legos program, maybe someone doing admin in the office\u2026and the wife. Did you read the part where the yard aide didn\u2019t know where the child was, just told Op to check the classrooms  since after school classes had just started?", "Reading comprehension must not be in their wheelhouse.", "Oh I missed that bit, you're right. But I can't imagine the yard aide would know where every kid is.", "Exactly my point, the yard aide would be included in \u201ceveryone knew where the kid was\u2026\u201d \n\nEdit: not sure if you were going for sarcasm I\u2019ve had 2 hours of sleep and dislike absolutes."]}
