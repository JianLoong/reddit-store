It was an arranged marriage, and during our talks, I asked her many times if she loved anyone else or was she getting forced at all. But everytime she claimed otherwise. We dated (I don't know the English term, but here it means the time from engagement to marriage) for 11 months and she was very enthusiastically into me, so we got married. When we had our kid, another guy claimed that it was his. A lot of drama happened and I found that he was her ex and AP. She agreed to marry me because of her family and the financial security I had (the ex was getting in/out of job). The divorce was extremely nasty and I lost a good fortune. Plus ordered to pay child support. (In India DNA test is not ordered if husband has access to wife, and any son born in marriage is automatically considered as the husband's). I never considered her son as mine, never met him. I had to pay till he graduates.\n\n Current situation: I never married again. My older brother and SIL sadly passed away 16 years ago and I took my niece and nephew as my own. I also recovered from the financial loss and now in very good comfortable position. 5 days ago I got a call from my ex's son who asked to have a meeting. I was hesitant but agreed. He wants me to fund his MBA. I denied, as the young man has no relationship with me, and the child support also stopped a long ago. I asked why doesn't he ask his real dad. Apparently the dad is not in his life anymore (didn't tell me much). I informed him that I have my own kids to look after. This led to an argument, which summaries as: I am spending money on someone's else's kid and not on my legal son.
