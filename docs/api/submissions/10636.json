Are you trying to understand where he is coming from as much as you expect from him?  This post makes you sound completely awful.  You actually said that the reason you aren't doing it is because he should.  Have you two discussed that, or did you unilaterally change the division of labor in the home?", "Yta", "Not usually, no. I think it's lack of sleep from us all being sick and just overall stressors with the pregnancy because I've been sick a lot. I think he's just stressed out BUT as I said in the post, any small inconvenience happens and he does make out like it happens all the time when it really doesn't. He can be super pessimistic when stressed.", "Yeah, what an AH taking care of two kids that arent his.", "Or when there's a new, tiny, demanding human with round the clock physical needs. He's been around the younger child since 1, but there's a lot of difference between newborn and 12mo+.", "Or hypertension which can lead to preeclampsia (it did for me)", "I honestly couldn't tell you the exact reason why he feels this way but I do have a general idea that I can lay out for you? So basically when we found out we were expecting he started doting on me to a point where I truly didn't have to do anything. Not because I wasn't capable or even because I asked anything of him but because he jumped in to do everything and would tell me to relax. So for like two weeks straight he was cleaning the house and cooking dinner every day and telling me to just go relax. Again, I didn't ask this of him. It also was at a point where if I said I wanted anything, he would immediately rush to go get it for me, even if it was just a comment in passing. Such as I said I wanted sprite the other day and I went to get my shoes on to go get it for myself from the store and by the time I got my shoes on he was already half way out the door. So I honestly feel like he may be getting a wee bit confused on me being incapable versus him doting on me on his own doing. Again, I haven't asked him for anything but there was a point there when he absolutely 100% wanted to do everything for me. Now he's just getting angry and saying I don't do anything since finding out I'm pregnant when that's truly not the case.", "Feel free to ask for info if you need it. I'm not trying to paint him in a bad light here and will give his side of the story.", "Actually she said the reason she isn't doing it is because he is capable and she does everything else whilst both work full time.\n\nThe fact that she's pregnant if anything only supports her argument. To get an idea, half-fill a basketball with water and a floating but dense rock and stick it under your shirt, then go up several flights of stairs whilst carrying 20+lbs in clothing in a basket.\n\nI say this as a child-less 30 year old bloke.", "Well to be blunt, he absolutely should be doing it. Reason being is because it's his only chore. Something we decided on together long ago. I clean the entire house and do 90% of the cooking, he does the laundry.", "It's going to be a lot more stressful with a baby. You should have a serious talk with him about managing his stress behavior and learning to cope before the baby is born.", "Very true.", "Sounds like you 2 need a heart2heart - ask him why he feels this way.", "Ok after this I guess NTA, but maybe N A H. He thought he could drop everything to wait on you and be a \u201cperfect partner\u201d and not is feeling stressed and probably guilty. Taking that out on you is not okay, but he\u2019s new to this. \n\nYou two need to communicate and he needs to learn being a good partner doesn\u2019t mean doing everything then getting resentful. It means doing what you need him to. \n\nNow what\u2019s concerning is you both work FT and you do everything, that\u2019s why I say NTA. That has to stop. Also I am no Dr but you\u2019re sounds a bit antiquated to say you can\u2019t lift more that 12 lbs? I was okayed for heavy exercise including weights if I was doing it before. (Obviously this could be different if you are high risk, but just saying it sounds odd).  Lastly if you are getting lightheaded you need to bring that up to a DR.  Could be low or high blood pressure, vitamin b12 deficiency, or a bunch of other things that could be super dangerous to your pregnancy!  Bringing husband to doctors is a good idea- even though lifting may be ok, carrying stuff on stairs when you get dizzy IS NOT OKAY.", "I'm going to say NAH then - you just need to communicate with each other. \"I really appreciate everything you've done since I got pregnant, I really don't need x/y/z/sprite but I really struggle with a/b/c/washing because so if you could help with that I'd appreciate it.\" and see where the conversation goes from there.", "So you just can\u2019t bring the laundry from A to B right? Not that you can\u2019t do it at ALL and this seems like it\u2019s also much more than there usually is right?\n\nBecause 6 heavy bags of laundry is a lot for any one person to go through and definitely one of the tougher/annoying chores out there. \n\nAlso how far along are you?", "If you read the OP you will find the information you seek.", "Taking care of two children by doing one chore while his pregnant partner works and parents full time?\n\n\nWhat a sacrifice that he chose to make.\n\nEdit: checked comment history. holy shit do you hate women. You're like 1/3 of \"obviously it's her fault she has a vagina\" comments on this sub single handedly.", "NTA this is not an acceptable way to be speaking to you or about your pregnancy. If you both work full-time, you should generally be splitting chores, but given your condition, he needs to step up and do more.", "NTA, but your husband sure is.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, my husband would get upset if I DID carry the laundry or even the groceries.", "NTA!! You are being very reasonable here he is not. you need to both calm down then have a talk about what is going on.", "Tell him I said he is stupid, because he truly is.  \nWhat an absolute tool.  \nSo, he'd rather have you stumble and fall down the stairs?  \n\n\nINFO: Do your kids do any chores at all? Is he truly not doing anything beside of the cat box and laundry? So, you do all the cooking, cleaning, parenting (driving, lunch boxes ect), appoinments and so on? Did you plan to have another child with him?  \n\n\nNTA   \nIt sounds like he is, tho.", "YTA for making it sound like an impossible thing. There is no reason why you couldn't split it up into reasonable chunks.\n\nI have no idea what your division of labor is. Maybe, you are pulling your weight. But you being pregnant doesn't give you an excuse to do nothing.", "Yeah, OP, he shouldn't be speaking to you like that for any reason. His temper is concerning, along with his complete lack of concern for you and your child. Is this relationship healthy otherwise? Is this person a good person otherwise?\n\nDoes he need to come with you to the doctor, so a DOCTOR can explain why you shouldn't be doing these things? Has he ever seen anyone to manage his anger?\n\nMan, I'd be scared to have a kid with this person.", "I was thinking this too. Let a medical professional explain it to him if he absolutely doesn't believe pregnant women shouldn't do too straining work.", "She had said feel free to ask? Lol this sub sometimes", "Well I more meant you didn't read the very first sentence of the OP.", "NTA his lack of empathy is disturbing.", "NTA but sweetie, don\u2019t you see the red flags?  This is not good.  You need to start preparing for an eventual divorce.  His behaviour is abusive.  When the baby comes it will get worse.  Time to start planning your escape.", "NTA.  Has he given any thought to the risk of you falling down the stairs while lugging laundry?  Your balance is already affected by the extra weight you're carrying and if you get lightheaded, it's a serious possibility.  \n\nNo offense, but may I ask what you see in him? Whether he's seen you pregnant before or not, he's certainly seen other pregnant women.  Do his mother and/or sisters live nearby?  Or could you call them?  I bet they'd set him straight, especially if they've had kids.  I mean, really, it's common sense that when a pregnant woman says \"I can't do this\" her partner needs to take up the slack.  He contributed to the current situation.  \n\nI don't have kids, but even I know that he's being the AH.", "This comment makes you sound like an AH.", "What you need to do, is have your husband tape a watermelon to his stomach, and then have him do all the things you do every single day. Cleaning, laundry, groceries, showing, driving, going to the bathroom, getting dressed, putting on socks and shoes, getting in and out of bed, siting on the couch and getting up. Everything and I mean everything. \n\nMaybe once he has felt what its like to carry a baby and do everything every single day, then he will stop batching about how you use your pregnancy as an excuse. \n\nBut you need to have some serious discussions with him, if this is how he's treating you now. I can only imagine how much worse it will get when the baby is here and he won't want to do anything, and demand that you do it all, since your the mom. \n\nYou two need to start talking these things through and setting limits to what you can and cant do. Otherwise you need to rethink the relationship.", "He can leave no one is forcing you. Do you expect him to receive an award or something.", "NTA. SHEESH. When I was pregnant I would get short of breath and lightheaded any time I did the stairs so my husband would carry the laundry up and down for me. I did the laundry and put it away. I just didn't carry the baskets. Why couldn't your husband do this? He's making a big deal out of nothing. He sounds like the AH.", "NTA fck your husband", "Nta.\nWooooow. Are you sure he wants this kid? I can\u2019t imagine my husband acting this way when I was pregnant. Especially for the first one.(his first anyway) Hell he wouldn\u2019t let me walk down the 3 front steps without holding my hand. I absolutely DO NOT think you should be doing the laundry but can the 12 and 8 year old not help out? Husband is being a massive AH but you shouldn\u2019t be dealing with this.", "Reading skills are  really important.\nWhen she falls down the stairs because she has an useless husband then you will be happy.\nGreat you don't know how they divided but still assumed she does nothing...what a prize.", "He chose to be involved with a parent. No one forced his dick in there."]}
