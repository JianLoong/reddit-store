Be prepared for him to be full of excuses when you need help with the baby. \n\nHave him come with you to the next OB/Gyn appointment and have the doctor speak to him about what you shouldn\u2019t be doing.

Are you trying to understand where he is coming from as much as you expect from him?  This post makes you sound completely awful.  You actually said that the reason you aren't doing it is because he should.  Have you two discussed that, or did you unilaterally change the division of labor in the home?", "Yta", "Not usually, no. I think it's lack of sleep from us all being sick and just overall stressors with the pregnancy because I've been sick a lot. I think he's just stressed out BUT as I said in the post, any small inconvenience happens and he does make out like it happens all the time when it really doesn't. He can be super pessimistic when stressed.", "Yeah, what an AH taking care of two kids that arent his.", "Or when there's a new, tiny, demanding human with round the clock physical needs. He's been around the younger child since 1, but there's a lot of difference between newborn and 12mo+.", "Or hypertension which can lead to preeclampsia (it did for me)", "I honestly couldn't tell you the exact reason why he feels this way but I do have a general idea that I can lay out for you? So basically when we found out we were expecting he started doting on me to a point where I truly didn't have to do anything. Not because I wasn't capable or even because I asked anything of him but because he jumped in to do everything and would tell me to relax. So for like two weeks straight he was cleaning the house and cooking dinner every day and telling me to just go relax. Again, I didn't ask this of him. It also was at a point where if I said I wanted anything, he would immediately rush to go get it for me, even if it was just a comment in passing. Such as I said I wanted sprite the other day and I went to get my shoes on to go get it for myself from the store and by the time I got my shoes on he was already half way out the door. So I honestly feel like he may be getting a wee bit confused on me being incapable versus him doting on me on his own doing. Again, I haven't asked him for anything but there was a point there when he absolutely 100% wanted to do everything for me. Now he's just getting angry and saying I don't do anything since finding out I'm pregnant when that's truly not the case.", "Feel free to ask for info if you need it. I'm not trying to paint him in a bad light here and will give his side of the story.", "Actually she said the reason she isn't doing it is because he is capable and she does everything else whilst both work full time.\n\nThe fact that she's pregnant if anything only supports her argument. To get an idea, half-fill a basketball with water and a floating but dense rock and stick it under your shirt, then go up several flights of stairs whilst carrying 20+lbs in clothing in a basket.\n\nI say this as a child-less 30 year old bloke.", "Well to be blunt, he absolutely should be doing it. Reason being is because it's his only chore. Something we decided on together long ago. I clean the entire house and do 90% of the cooking, he does the laundry.", "It's going to be a lot more stressful with a baby. You should have a serious talk with him about managing his stress behavior and learning to cope before the baby is born.", "Very true.", "Sounds like you 2 need a heart2heart - ask him why he feels this way.", "Ok after this I guess NTA, but maybe N A H. He thought he could drop everything to wait on you and be a \u201cperfect partner\u201d and not is feeling stressed and probably guilty. Taking that out on you is not okay, but he\u2019s new to this. \n\nYou two need to communicate and he needs to learn being a good partner doesn\u2019t mean doing everything then getting resentful. It means doing what you need him to. \n\nNow what\u2019s concerning is you both work FT and you do everything, that\u2019s why I say NTA. That has to stop. Also I am no Dr but you\u2019re sounds a bit antiquated to say you can\u2019t lift more that 12 lbs? I was okayed for heavy exercise including weights if I was doing it before. (Obviously this could be different if you are high risk, but just saying it sounds odd).  Lastly if you are getting lightheaded you need to bring that up to a DR.  Could be low or high blood pressure, vitamin b12 deficiency, or a bunch of other things that could be super dangerous to your pregnancy!  Bringing husband to doctors is a good idea- even though lifting may be ok, carrying stuff on stairs when you get dizzy IS NOT OKAY.", "I'm going to say NAH then - you just need to communicate with each other. \"I really appreciate everything you've done since I got pregnant, I really don't need x/y/z/sprite but I really struggle with a/b/c/washing because so if you could help with that I'd appreciate it.\" and see where the conversation goes from there.", "So you just can\u2019t bring the laundry from A to B right? Not that you can\u2019t do it at ALL and this seems like it\u2019s also much more than there usually is right?\n\nBecause 6 heavy bags of laundry is a lot for any one person to go through and definitely one of the tougher/annoying chores out there. \n\nAlso how far along are you?", "If you read the OP you will find the information you seek.", "Taking care of two children by doing one chore while his pregnant partner works and parents full time?\n\n\nWhat a sacrifice that he chose to make.\n\nEdit: checked comment history. holy shit do you hate women. You're like 1/3 of \"obviously it's her fault she has a vagina\" comments on this sub single handedly."]}
