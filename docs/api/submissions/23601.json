Not a single one of them still pursues acting. I do during the summers when my university job is out and my side business is somewhat slow. \n\nWhile she is an adult and can ultimately choose to do what she wants, you are not wrong to be worried about her or wanting her to put her education first. I think it was an asshole move of her to say that she basically expects you to pay for her tuition while she uses her savings to pay for her pursuits.

So it's going to be up to you to reign in her expectations. Yes, modeling is dangerous for naive young girls. She will need you on her side. So you need to show her you trust her, or she will not trust you. She needs you for a gut check when she's in over her head, not as an authoritarian. She's an adult, so allow her to make her own choices. But be there for support.\n\nAlso, modeling is not forever. Most people age out quickly.

She needs to be tough enough to take the 95% rejection that comes with go see and tough enough that she won't take that rejection out on her own body. There are also a LOT of predatory men in modeling as well, so if she does go to New York you need to prepare her for every red flag there is and make sure she takes every precaution available plus is also confident enough to send the creeps running.

Give her a specific amount of time, say 6 months or a year, and if she doesn't book a certain amount of gigs or earn a certain amount of money she will agree to follow through with college. No reason she can't model while going to college, I did it for 9 years!\nExplain to her the reasons WHY you are afraid to let her go and try to come to a compromise.", "YTA \n\nShes an adult and she earned that money.

If she wants to take the opportunity, then she clearly enjoys it! Also, it's entirely normal for people to take a 'gap year' and go exploring and working before starting a degree. This is not unreasonable. And again, she seems to be getting paid for this, and it sounds like it could be a world-expanding, creative life experience for her. As someone from the bottom of Australia, I can't imagine just how many opportunities and experiences NYC would offer for an aspiring model with a talent agency backing her up. Let her do this; she might do the year and decide she's happy to go ahead with her degree and keep modelling as a side-job to keep her afloat whilst studying, or she might love it so much she might decide to make a full career out of it, or even study something related- like fashion design or something else creative. Life doesn't always turn out the way we expect; and the things we aspire to be as kids don't always linger into adulthood.

Use YOUR money that you earned how you want. Technically their money is theirs. That being said, I think the money should still be used for her no matter what, but not as a reason for them to have to use the money meant for her + expecting them to pay for her entire education (taking the 100k for her NY stay then expecting them to pay at least that for her schooling).

In some fields of modelling, it's more of an unspoken requirement.", "The British have a tradition of a 'gap year', where the student travels, volunteers or anything instead of going right to more studying. It should be more universal. It is a chance to unwind and maybe find their calling.", "Everyone I know that went straight to college/uni after high school ended up dropping out. They did it because \"it's what you do\" but hadn't figured themselves out yet to know what career to actually pursue.\n\nI took a few years off, went back and got my degree. Ended up not using it at all though! Haha. But still proud I finished. I think making mistakes and living as an adult for a few years gave me more of an appreciation for college,and I worked harder than I would have at 18 and fresh out of high school.", ">Going onto further education straight after high school is not always the best option, plenty of people take a year or two to discover what the really want.\n\nAs someone who teaches university classes, I strongly recommend that anyone who can take a gap year or five. Way too many American students go straight into college at 18 and drop out halfway through because they are in over their heads and not emotionally invested in their studies. THAT is a waste of time and money. \n\nThere is (in general) such a big difference in maturity, focus and ambition between 18-20 year old students and students who are in their mid-20s and beyond. Given how expensive American colleges are, I think it's really wasteful to push students into college when their hearts aren't in it. An extra year or two is not going to make or break their future career.\n\nOP, you mentioned you are partly worried about your daughter's safety.

I don't think we can trust OP to reliably convey what happened between her daughter and the modeling agency.", "IDK, I could see OP being fine with the safety issues while their daughters is living at home because they have the illusion that they have some level of control over her safety and the ability to protect her right now.\n\nIf she moves to NYC all bets are off.", "My concern is that if she\u2019s as stubborn as me, she\u2019ll waste another year sticking it out if she doesn\u2019t like it just because she doesn\u2019t want to go home to a \u201ctold you so\u201d attitude. \n\nAllowing her to try it out and remaining supportive gives her a better framework to make the right decisions.", "A talk about power dynamics and sexual assault would be equally in order if she heads directly to college.", "I wonder if OP traveled with daughter when daughter was modeling abroad\u2026 that could explain it, though OP only mentions safety as an aside towards the end of the post\u2026", "Info: What is the foundation of your concerns?\n\nAs someone who teaches at an undergraduate institution, I can honestly say that I love students who started their education a bit later. To be clear, that wasn\u2019t me: I started getting excited about college when I was 5, and that didn\u2019t change. With that said, I\u2019ve had students from so many backgrounds (had kids earlier than intended, were battling addiction, were caring for a sick family member, were in a different country, or just didn\u2019t feel ready), and by the time they get to my class they have a strong sense of self and they know they want this education.\n\nKids who go right away because it\u2019s their parents\u2019 expectation stand out: even if they still get good grades, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not engaging with the material beyond the bare minimum to get the grades, and they spend half their college years figuring out who they really are / who they want to be. No matter what I do as an instructor, I cannot force them to get the same quality education as a student who genuinely wants to be there and isn\u2019t trying to balance their education with their self-exploration and personal development. \n\nLearning has two parts: being able to demonstrate enough knowledge to pass a test, and engaging with the material in a way that will result in lasting learning, curiosity, and innovative application. An instructor can grade a student on the former, but the latter depends entirely on the student; no parent, teacher, or other authority figure can force that on a student who doesn\u2019t want it yet / isn\u2019t ready. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re worried for your daughter\u2019s safety, I understand that and I think it\u2019s worth finding a way to address that to the best of your ability. Maybe she would be willing to see a doctor every month to confirm her food intake is still healthy? Would you be able to go with her for a year (I don\u2019t know what your employment situation is), as a compromise solution?\n\nBut if you think college has to start at 18, I can\u2019t adequately express what a misconception that is.\n\nAnd if you think college and following in her father\u2019s footsteps are the only acceptable path, please reconsider; this concept that everyone successful went to college is getting old, and it isn\u2019t helping anyone.", ">I used to walk the catwalk in Paris and New York as a model.

Ended up taking a gap year after first year, and branched out in the entertainment industry to management/booking agent, when I went back I paid for my degree in literature/writing and graduated with no debt. Worked as a writer/event planner for 10 years, went back to school at 32 for HR. My parents told me each time I made a choice that it was the wrong choice because THEY wouldn\u2019t have made this choice, but they all turned out fine. Was it hard? Yes, but the experience I got was invaluable. I\u2019ve been consistently employed since 2004 without any gaps aside for my maternity leave.", "Let her do it.

I say let her do it, but with a plan. I would get her to agree on no going into debt. She runs out of money, adventure over.

That\u2019s her choice of course but a parent knows she may really regret that decision in 5 years when she\u2019s scraping by eating ramen and mac and cheese in a tiny run down apartment. Then she resents her parents for not making her do the smart thing because she was immature and didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nThis is the calculus the parents have to look ahead at 5-10 years down the road.

It may be a great experience, it may be a terrible experience, but she won't spend her life resenting that you wouldn't let her have the experience.  She's going to go anyhow.

It\u2019s not what I did and I kick myself all the time. Instead I took my break right in the middle of college to travel and am just now going back in my 30\u2019s to finish. Glad I spent all that money for pre-requisites at a university! (Lol, not!). Taking the year or so BEFORE and working on the prereq\u2019s is the absolute way to go! Smart!", "I agree as well. Speaking from personal experience. I was pressured into going to university straight out of high school by my family. Ended up doing half a degree that I hated and dropped out in my second year. \n\nI worked terrible jobs (learned the value of a degree), travelled, had a baby and then decided I was ready to go back to university to pursue a completely different career path that I wouldn\u2019t have pursued at 18. The main difference is that even though I\u2019m a mother and I had to work to support my family, my grades were significantly better due to the fact that I wanted to study. As a result of that I now have a great job and am looking at doing a post grad research degree. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to have everything mapped out at 18. This is what I\u2019ll be telling my daughters.", "This list is great! And frankly establishing this kind of trust and building up her life skills is important whether she goes to NYC or not -- while the modeling scene is more adult, college isn't exactly risk free either regarding SA, drugs, etc. OP should want her daughter to trust her and feel safe reaching out if she's in trouble -- and right now she's headed down a path where that won't be the case regardless of where the daughter is next year.", "We are not alone, and we have more choices than we did back then.

There is nothing more soul sucking than to live your life with regrets and couldabeens. My father lived that life because of an injury when he was 19, and unfortunately,  I find myself in the same situation because I didn't take opportunities when they presented themselves. OP needs to let her daughter live the life she wants to try, and just be there to support her in whichever way is needed.", "Thats def not the worse.", "Right because modeling totally isn\u2019t based on youth and beauty", "It's one thing about chops and having them fly her out. It's another thing to have to pay for it herself. I agree that she should definitely follow her passions. That being said, she needs to work things out more with this agency before moving to NYC. As someone who lived there for a majority of life, it is NOT easy living in NYC. It's pretty expensive, the general infrastructure of how government runs things is pretty poor, and there's a TON of competition here. If she is intending to do this, she needs to have a long, serious conversation with her agency about how they will ensure her stability. Will they be paying part of her rent? Will they be her guarantors? Will she be receiving a stipend instead? What about benefits over there in NYC, will they take care of her health insurance and find her an in network physician? Is this contracted work or will she be given a salary?\n\nIt's not a bad thing to chase your dreams. But it IS a bad thing to let your dreams cloud reality. I'd say as long as she and her father discuss things with her agency and get it in writing that they will properly support her, she should go for it.", "Yes! If OP is so concerned that her adult daughter is \"too naive\" to go live away from home and work for a year, that's pretty telling.

Also tell her she better figure out her own finances while pursuing it.", "I can't believe I had to scroll so much to see this comment.  Totally agree with you.  There's some bad choices out there especially if going down the hard drug route.   I wonder if the daughter is aware of these risks.  I hope she isn't embracing those dangers, or worse, knee deep in them already.", "That last part, for sure. She should definitely save what she can to eventually pay for school.", "It\u2019s her modelling money, not the mother\u2019s.", "This!! If you force her to go to college, she really will waste a year (or more) of her life because she will feel she isn't where she wants to be, and won't do as well as she would if she chose to be there. \n\nMaybe she wants to do the software degree but really wants the gap year to get that life experience first. You did say she's naive - maybe she knows this and this modelling year will be the year to find herself and grow a little.\n\nMy mum forced me to choose French instead of Systems Engineering as a school subject when I was 13.

It's about the fact that you are saying the parent can ALLOW the girl to do so. The majority of people who do what they are being pressured to do rather than want they wish to end up not only with regrets but with negative side effects also. Parents thinking they get to sway decisions like this are never a good idea. Especially when college will still be there after she gets to do the once in a lifetime experience. In most other countries it is normal to take gap years. There are countless benefits to that. OP trying to push something their daughter doesn't want, and miss out on an opportunity that will not come around again, is not ok. Hell it isn't even good parenting.", "Yes, Wix I think.  She was one of the biggest high fashion models in the world in the 2000s.", "At a similar age I answered \"Christmas tree\" and I'm honestly still disappointed that's not an option.", "I have some friends in particular who are excellent cat parents.
