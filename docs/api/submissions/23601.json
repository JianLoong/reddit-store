I chose to pursue different avenues because I could not afford to move to NYC at that time. \n\nEvery single one of my friends ended up moving back home within two or three years because they could not afford it and there are more actors and models than there are jobs. Not a single one of them still pursues acting. I do during the summers when my university job is out and my side business is somewhat slow. \n\nWhile she is an adult and can ultimately choose to do what she wants, you are not wrong to be worried about her or wanting her to put her education first. I think it was an asshole move of her to say that she basically expects you to pay for her tuition while she uses her savings to pay for her pursuits.

So it's going to be up to you to reign in her expectations. Yes, modeling is dangerous for naive young girls. She will need you on her side. So you need to show her you trust her, or she will not trust you. She needs you for a gut check when she's in over her head, not as an authoritarian. She's an adult, so allow her to make her own choices. But be there for support.\n\nAlso, modeling is not forever. Most people age out quickly.

Make sure she checks how long the train will take to get into Manhattan because no way she would live in Manhattan itself (I lived right by the subway and it still took me 40 min on a good day to get to even the first stop in Manhattan).

She needs to be tough enough to take the 95% rejection that comes with go see and tough enough that she won't take that rejection out on her own body. There are also a LOT of predatory men in modeling as well, so if she does go to New York you need to prepare her for every red flag there is and make sure she takes every precaution available plus is also confident enough to send the creeps running. Most women who are big fish in their town while modeling realize within 3 months that there are 1,000 other models who look exactly like them in New York. I think she may resent you for not allowing her to try to \"make it\", but I would put some limits on her new adventure. Give her a specific amount of time, say 6 months or a year, and if she doesn't book a certain amount of gigs or earn a certain amount of money she will agree to follow through with college. No reason she can't model while going to college, I did it for 9 years!\nExplain to her the reasons WHY you are afraid to let her go and try to come to a compromise.", "YTA \n\nShes an adult and she earned that money.

If she wants to take the opportunity, then she clearly enjoys it! Also, it's entirely normal for people to take a 'gap year' and go exploring and working before starting a degree. This is not unreasonable. And again, she seems to be getting paid for this, and it sounds like it could be a world-expanding, creative life experience for her. As someone from the bottom of Australia, I can't imagine just how many opportunities and experiences NYC would offer for an aspiring model with a talent agency backing her up. Let her do this; she might do the year and decide she's happy to go ahead with her degree and keep modelling as a side-job to keep her afloat whilst studying, or she might love it so much she might decide to make a full career out of it, or even study something related- like fashion design or something else creative. Life doesn't always turn out the way we expect; and the things we aspire to be as kids don't always linger into adulthood.

Use YOUR money that you earned how you want. Technically their money is theirs. That being said, I think the money should still be used for her no matter what, but not as a reason for them to have to use the money meant for her + expecting them to pay for her entire education (taking the 100k for her NY stay then expecting them to pay at least that for her schooling). How that money is spent should be her choice, with the expectation that it's not fun money.
