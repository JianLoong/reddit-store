A few months after the split, my dad introduced my brother and I to my now stepmom, who we'll call \"Mary\".\n\nMy dad never gave Mary any kinds of boundaries when it came to dealing with my brother and I. So growing up she'd often cross the line and my dad wouldn't do anything to stand up for my brother and I and ALWAYS sided with Mary. I endured a lot of emotional and verbal abuse from both my dad and Mary going up. Fast forward years later, my dad and I now have a pretty good relationship and I've forgiven him. I've forgiven Mary but don't have a close relationship with her. We're cordial with each other but not close by any means. (I've never gotten an actual apology from either of them, I've just chosen to forgive and let it go. But never forget).\n\nMy dad and Mary had there wedding in early 2020, right before COVID. I was not involved at all in the wedding. I wasn't in the wedding party and my boyfriend and I were sat at a table with other 4 people in total (including) us. It was essentially like the left over table IMO. My younger brother was in the wedding party, as a groomsmen so he was sat at the head table, the whole situation just made me feel pretty shitty that I wasn't really involved in the wedding at all, besides for a few pictures.\n\nSo now bf (or fianc\u00e9e now) and I have been engaged for a year and the wedding is next month. My dad is going to be walking me down the isle. I sat my mom, dad, brother and both my grandparents in the front row for the ceremony. Mary is sat in the row behind them. My dad asked me why Mary was sat in the row behind him and why she can't sit with him? I told him that the front row is for my IMMEDIATE family only and that's how I want it.\n\nApparently she is unhappy and uncomfortable with this, and feels that she should be more involved in the wedding. I told my dad ok sucks for her? I was unhappy and uncomfortable and her and my dads wedding and I sucked it up for a day.\n\nMy dads financially pitching in to help for the wedding and Mary has threatened to take away the financial help from \"my dad and her\". I told her to do whatever she wants and that I frankly don't really care. She's been bad mouthing me to both my dad and my brother saying how I'm a major AH for doing and after \"all she's done for me\".\n\nMy brother think's I'm in the right and it's my day. My dad is of course, siding with Mary, and understands that it's my day but feels like I should be considerate of her and her feeling's. AITA for not sitting her with my dad and involving her more?\n\nINFO: If I was to sit Mary beside my dad i'd have to move either one of my grandparents, my mom or my brother to the second row.

If I were in your position, I would be tempted to have my brother walk me.  Dad and his new wife can sit together in the second row.  As for the financial assistance, just drop it.

You were jilted at their wedding sitting at a random table for the reception and she probably didnt care at all how you felt.

However, I would echo other commenters here that normally, spouses should be seated together. The best way to handle this may be to just ask your brother to walk you down the aisle or walk down the aisle solo and seat both your dad and Mary in the second row.

You want him to be involved in the wedding. In spite of this, you are very publicly sitting him next to his ex-wife and banishing his current wife to not be allowed to sit next to him. You are totally allowed to do this, but that's a blindingly obvious, extremely petty jab. Is the seating arrangement of the front row vs. the second row really so important to you that you would choose to blow up your dad's participation in your wedding over that? And if the seating arrangement here is that important to you, is your relationship with your dad really strong enough that you want him walking you down the aisle and a major participant in the wedding?\n\nAdditionally, people talk. Sitting your dad next to his ex-wife could very well attract attention, even if both he and Mary don't say anything during the event (and they probably will). Do you think that having to potentially field questions about what you're doing is worth this small moment of pettiness? Will it really improve your wedding, overall, to smirk at your dad sitting next to his ex-wife and then have even a single person ask \"yo, is your dad back with your mom?\" and then have to explain your little seating trick to them?", "I\u2019d sit dad and wife together behind with both grandparents. That ought to shut her up. It never pays to be petty. The ceremony will be over before you know it. She just wants to sit with her husband which is traditional and which I would not deny her.

The only reason I'm not saying YT-only-A is because Mary's response is shitty as well. \n\nSomeone being seated in a front row during a   ceremony is hardly being \"involved\" in a wedding. Like it or not, you may not have a relationship with Mary \u2014 nor do you have to \u2014 but if you consider your dad part of your immediate family, so is his wife, at least when it comes to seating assignments. \n\nIf you care about your relationship with your dad, have his wife sit next to him. This is such a small thing... you're not going to look back at your wedding photos and give any F's about where people were sitting during the ceremony.\n\nEdit: deleted extra words", "NTA. You accept her as your stepmom because she married your dad but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to consider her family.

Dad needs to grow a pair and advocate for you against Mary when she\u2019s pushy. \n\nYou suck for the seating situation. I totally get that you were slighted and rightfully don\u2019t want this entitled person who mistreated you involved in planning or the wedding party. She deserves no part. \n\nBUT let her sit by your dad. Putting her a row back for the ceremony is an intentional slight and basically puts your dad in the position that he has to defend her. I get she pissed you off, but the purposeful insult of not being able to sit by her husband will live on in her memory forever. For the sake of peace at your wedding and maybe in general in the future I would personally make that compromise. Take that gossip point and potential for drama off the table for her. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding though, you gotta follow your convictions if you truly feel that strongly about it. \n\nGood luck and congrats!", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou're knowingly being very petty refusing to let her sit with your Dad because you're mad about their wedding.\n\nAnd if you're accepting financial help from them, then don't act shocked when they cut it off when you exclude her \n\nIt's his wife. It's your day, but there will be consequences", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t right for them to not include you in their wedding, but at least you and your BF were able to sit together. At least give your dad the option of sitting in the second row with his wife. You said he pitched in for your wedding. How much did he pitch in percentage wise? Will they be able to sit together during dinner? Also, you put \u201cmy dad and her\u201d in quotes to insinuate that only your dad is helping financially when they\u2019re married and that money is also hers.

Please state you you have forgiven your dad for his past treatment of you, but have not forgotten, if he messes this up you will be going NC or LC for the foreseeable future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, dad was probably cheating.", "NTA - If it were me they would have been cut off long ago,  \nYou're a better person than me for forgiving them without an apology.  \nBut if you will, maybe they act the way they do because they think your a door mat.   \nOne who folds and accepts it as it is and wont make a fuss.   \nNow that you are kicking up a fuss due to the way you were in the past they are trying to take advantage of it.   \nIf you are inclined just disinvite both your father and step mother, its the only way their actions have consequences.", "NTA. \nIf it were me and my dad kept pushing it I would say fine take ur money back my brother will walk me down and u guys can sit in the 2nd row and u guys will have a seat at a table in the back like u did me.. but I\u2019m petty lol..", "In this case you\u2019re the drama but not the asshole. Dad should sit with his wife in second row. And later ar a random table (am petty too) and leave it at that.", "NTA but I don't get why you're having your dad walk you down the aisle. He sounds like an ass", "NTA. Tell your dad he can be there for you or not be considered family and ruin your relationship even more.", "NTA \n\nIt's your day, your choice.", "The things I would be telling Mary if it were me...", "They split up her and her brother. Only fair.", "In Memoriam: Mary's Decency and Dad's Backbone", "Did you seat them at the leftover table?? \ud83d\ude06 Because I would be really tempted to just because of the fuss Mary is making about the ceremony seating!  NTA", "NTA but weird you having gone nuclear on that ass yet both Mary and your dads.", "NTA. Throw mary and your dad in the back row if they want to sit together so badly.", "NTA", "You are being extremely considerate of her.  You are allowing her to attend.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your dad is clearly not even remotely sorry for his prior actions and still thinks it's ok to treat you like a second class citizen but expect you to treat him and his wife like you would ACTUAL parents which they Aren't.  They've proven it over and over and over and are reinforcing it again.  \"Hey OP you should be fine being stuck in the red headed step child seat at OUR wdding, but your stepmom deserves a place of honor at YOUR wedding.\"  He may not be saying it out loud but he's saying it in his actions.  Frankly I'd uninvite them both, tell them to keep their money and tell dad that he now gets his wish of a family without you, but honestly someone who sides with someone blatantly in the wrong 100% of the time isn't someone I tend to want in my life, dna be damned.", "NTA, Mary doesn't have to come.", "NTA but sit dad in the 2nd row with his wife.  Not sure why your mother would want to sit beside her ex.", "NTA\n\nTell dad if he doesn\u2019t stop pressuring you, you are going to cut him off too and you\u2019ll find someone else to walk you down the aisle.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf your dad's uncomfortable not sitting with Mary, fine. Put them both in the second row and have either your brother or your mother walk you down the aisle. Or walk by yourself because no one needs to \"give you away\".", "NTA\n\nYou could theoretically move your dad back a row to sit with her, just have him sit on the end so he can reach his seat easily.", "NTA. There's been some pretty good ideas put forward here to resolve this. Your father can go sit with her in the second row. Your mother can walk you down the aisle, after all this is the 21st-century. If you feel the need to have testosterone walking beside you, you have a brother and a grandfather. I'd say cutting Dad out of any active role in the wedding and sitting him in the second row with his wife is the way to go considering the relationship you had.", "Nta, just let them know you're treating her how she treated you. Your dad freaking sucks, you're a bigger person than I am", "N T A/ E S H\n\nI dunno. Don\u2019t blame you for not moving your grandparents.\n\nJust sit both your Dad and his wife in the second row together - he deserves it just as much as her because he\u2019s the enabler, and he is the sole reason you weren\u2019t in the wedding party more, not her.\n\nI think you\u2019re mad at the wrong person for not being included in the wedding. You are there as the Grooms guest and on the grooms side - if she and Dad divorced tomorrow you wouldn\u2019t give a damn about her. So your place is unambiguously the grooms side.\n\nThe bridal party isn\u2019t assorted female relatives, it\u2019s women closest to *the bride*. You said yourself you two aren\u2019t particularly close, you aren\u2019t fond of her and don\u2019t have a good relationship, let alone that of bonus mom and daughter. So you wouldn\u2019t be one of the closest people to the bride, that would be her sister and her best friends - the women who love her most, not someone who doesn\u2019t like her much and probably isn\u2019t thrilled to be at this wedding. You had absolutely no reason to expect to be a part of the bridal party, and with all the bad blood between you two be honest: you\u2019d have hated it.\n\nYou should have been more involved on your fathers side however, given a reading or seated with his other family members. He could have made you a best woman. He is the one who should have insisted you sit with the rest of his family when seating plans were discussed. He is the one who should be gunning to have you in all the photos, because you\u2019re his kid, and he let you down on that front. It\u2019s clear from this you and stepmother both tolerate each other for your fathers sake. Let\u2019s be real, even if this wedding issue didn\u2019t come up, would you be pushing to have lots of pictures of her at your wedding? Would you have given  her ANY role in yours except the bare minimum of seating her next to your father at the dinner because they\u2019re a couple and couples tend to sit together regardless of if one\u2019s in the party or not?\n\nYour father excluded you from his wedding, not her. If she did, her role was in abetting your fathers exclusion.\n\nYou can seat her where you want, but usually couples are seated together so this feels like it was chosen specifically to be a jab\u2026 especially since you can\u2019t really snub her by not including her in any role because you\u2019d never have given her one and she\u2019d have never expected one. But it\u2019s your wedding and owe her nothing. So I can\u2019t figure out a judgement.\n\nYour bad history with her is probably the bigger reason to snub her\n\nI just really think you\u2019re mad at the wrong person. Possibly because it\u2019s easier to hate her than admit your fathers the problem.", "Obviously OP YNTA, but I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019re going to be very bitter and put both dad and step-mum on the left over table", "NTA\n\nBut here is the question OP:  Does your father have to walk you down the aisle?  I mean that if she is going to pitch a fit about not being included or seated with your father there would be several solutions:\n\n1)  You will need to refuse all financial help from your father.  That you change your entire wedding plans where his money is no longer part of the equation and thus eliminating any of that say or ability to say anything.  And to prevent them from holding it over your head.\n\n2)  The question still remains, does your father have to walk you down the aisle?  I mean if you are not wanting his financial support, eliminate the father/daughter dance, and that part where he walks and gives you away.  This way he can be seated with his wife, though no longer in the front row.\n\n3)  Now this is going to be unpopular, but refuse/return the money and then just uninvite both of them.  There is no amount of money, no amount of being in good with anyone where it would equate out to the stress that she is going to have.\n\nAnd if she is going to rock the boat to get what she wants, you also should know that eloping and a court house wedding can work just as well, where you invite a few people to witness and avoid alot of that drama.\n\nTalk to your fiance about this and then time to talk to your father,", "NTA, tell your dad she's lucky she got an invite.", "NTA but really just here to say how sorry I am, OP. My dad is this way with his girlfriend, and the verbal abuse I have swallowed for the sake of a relationship with my dad is embarrassing. Don\u2019t let their nonsense spoil your day!", "I'm confused why you're allowing your father to walk you down the aisle after he sat you in the back of his own wedding? I would seat them both in the back just like you were.", "NTA but they are helping you financially and unfortunately she probably has enough sway to get the funds cut off.  Just make sure you have a way to wing it if that does happen.  I am at that point with certain family members with my husbands.  Just a complete \"I don't care!\"", "This. OP this sounds like a great solution and your dad can sit with Mary in the row closest to the back of the room. Just like what Mary did to you.", "Yeah and put dad and Mary at the far left over table at the reception", "Yeah OP is just being vindictive towards Mary for actions that her Dad had a hand in.  I can't understand for the life of me why OP thinks this is acceptable?  Either relegate Dad to Mary's level or realise that Mary should be at Dad's level.\n\n>down the isle\n\nAlso congrats on the beach wedding OP.", "How did she make her feel like crap though? She\u2019s on the grooms side and there for her father. He\u2019s her relative and so HE should be the one making sure she\u2019s included, seated at a good table, given a reading etc. \n\nShe\u2019s her fathers kid, not hers, and by OPs own admission she doesn\u2019t particularly have a great relationship with her, let alone see her as a bonus mum or anything like that. The bridal party are the women who are closest to the *bride*. The women who love her the most and are there through thick and thin. That\u2019s her sister and her dearest friends who actually like her.\n\nAll in all, it would make no sense to have her as part of the bridal party, and as the grooms guest and the father it\u2019s up to him to include her. He should be the one including her and the one she\u2019s mad at.", "Mary hasn't finished being abusive to OP yet.", "> you\u2019re being petty.\n\nAnd?", "Yeah, but isn\u2019t this your Dads fault not Mary\u2019s? Why would you be in her bridal party?\n\nThe bridal party are the women closest to the bride. You admit that you two aren\u2019t close, and she\u2019s the stepmother not your bio mother with whom she doesn\u2019t have a mother/daughter relationship. It makes sense why she would have the women closest to her, her sister and her dearest friends as bridesmaids. \n\nYour father could have made you a best woman or found you something to do, and since you\u2019re his direct family and you would definitely be on the Grooms side and you are more his guest, so seating you should be his duty. You\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.\n\nYou weren\u2019t at the wedding to support her - you would never speak to her again if she divorced your father - you were there to support your father and he\u2019s the one who cast you aside", "You have the comment of the day.", "I disagree. If Mary or OP's dad had any emotional intelligence they would have immediately realized that they were excluding OP. Best case scenario she's clueless. More likely... She just doesn't give a fuck.", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the latter and would also wager that seating OP at the leftover table was a bit of retaliation for OP not accepting her as her \u201cnew mom\u201d.", "Word."]}
