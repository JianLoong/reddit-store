A few months after the split, my dad introduced my brother and I to my now stepmom, who we'll call \"Mary\".\n\nMy dad never gave Mary any kinds of boundaries when it came to dealing with my brother and I. So growing up she'd often cross the line and my dad wouldn't do anything to stand up for my brother and I and ALWAYS sided with Mary. I endured a lot of emotional and verbal abuse from both my dad and Mary going up. Fast forward years later, my dad and I now have a pretty good relationship and I've forgiven him. I've forgiven Mary but don't have a close relationship with her. We're cordial with each other but not close by any means. (I've never gotten an actual apology from either of them, I've just chosen to forgive and let it go. But never forget).\n\nMy dad and Mary had there wedding in early 2020, right before COVID. I was not involved at all in the wedding. I wasn't in the wedding party and my boyfriend and I were sat at a table with other 4 people in total (including) us. It was essentially like the left over table IMO. My younger brother was in the wedding party, as a groomsmen so he was sat at the head table, the whole situation just made me feel pretty shitty that I wasn't really involved in the wedding at all, besides for a few pictures.\n\nSo now bf (or fianc\u00e9e now) and I have been engaged for a year and the wedding is next month. My dad is going to be walking me down the isle. I sat my mom, dad, brother and both my grandparents in the front row for the ceremony. Mary is sat in the row behind them. My dad asked me why Mary was sat in the row behind him and why she can't sit with him? I told him that the front row is for my IMMEDIATE family only and that's how I want it.\n\nApparently she is unhappy and uncomfortable with this, and feels that she should be more involved in the wedding. I told my dad ok sucks for her? I was unhappy and uncomfortable and her and my dads wedding and I sucked it up for a day.\n\nMy dads financially pitching in to help for the wedding and Mary has threatened to take away the financial help from \"my dad and her\". I told her to do whatever she wants and that I frankly don't really care. She's been bad mouthing me to both my dad and my brother saying how I'm a major AH for doing and after \"all she's done for me\".\n\nMy brother think's I'm in the right and it's my day. My dad is of course, siding with Mary, and understands that it's my day but feels like I should be considerate of her and her feeling's. AITA for not sitting her with my dad and involving her more?\n\nINFO: If I was to sit Mary beside my dad i'd have to move either one of my grandparents, my mom or my brother to the second row.

If I were in your position, I would be tempted to have my brother walk me.  Dad and his new wife can sit together in the second row.  As for the financial assistance, just drop it.

You were jilted at their wedding sitting at a random table for the reception and she probably didnt care at all how you felt.

However, I would echo other commenters here that normally, spouses should be seated together. The best way to handle this may be to just ask your brother to walk you down the aisle or walk down the aisle solo and seat both your dad and Mary in the second row.

You want him to be involved in the wedding. In spite of this, you are very publicly sitting him next to his ex-wife and banishing his current wife to not be allowed to sit next to him. You are totally allowed to do this, but that's a blindingly obvious, extremely petty jab. Is the seating arrangement of the front row vs. the second row really so important to you that you would choose to blow up your dad's participation in your wedding over that? And if the seating arrangement here is that important to you, is your relationship with your dad really strong enough that you want him walking you down the aisle and a major participant in the wedding?\n\nAdditionally, people talk. Sitting your dad next to his ex-wife could very well attract attention, even if both he and Mary don't say anything during the event (and they probably will). Do you think that having to potentially field questions about what you're doing is worth this small moment of pettiness? Will it really improve your wedding, overall, to smirk at your dad sitting next to his ex-wife and then have even a single person ask \"yo, is your dad back with your mom?\" and then have to explain your little seating trick to them?", "I\u2019d sit dad and wife together behind with both grandparents. That ought to shut her up. It never pays to be petty. The ceremony will be over before you know it. She just wants to sit with her husband which is traditional and which I would not deny her.

The only reason I'm not saying YT-only-A is because Mary's response is shitty as well. \n\nSomeone being seated in a front row during a   ceremony is hardly being \"involved\" in a wedding. Like it or not, you may not have a relationship with Mary \u2014 nor do you have to \u2014 but if you consider your dad part of your immediate family, so is his wife, at least when it comes to seating assignments. \n\nIf you care about your relationship with your dad, have his wife sit next to him. This is such a small thing... you're not going to look back at your wedding photos and give any F's about where people were sitting during the ceremony.\n\nEdit: deleted extra words", "NTA. You accept her as your stepmom because she married your dad but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to consider her family.

Dad needs to grow a pair and advocate for you against Mary when she\u2019s pushy. \n\nYou suck for the seating situation. I totally get that you were slighted and rightfully don\u2019t want this entitled person who mistreated you involved in planning or the wedding party. She deserves no part. \n\nBUT let her sit by your dad. Putting her a row back for the ceremony is an intentional slight and basically puts your dad in the position that he has to defend her. I get she pissed you off, but the purposeful insult of not being able to sit by her husband will live on in her memory forever. For the sake of peace at your wedding and maybe in general in the future I would personally make that compromise. Take that gossip point and potential for drama off the table for her. \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding though, you gotta follow your convictions if you truly feel that strongly about it. \n\nGood luck and congrats!", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nYou're knowingly being very petty refusing to let her sit with your Dad because you're mad about their wedding.\n\nAnd if you're accepting financial help from them, then don't act shocked when they cut it off when you exclude her \n\nIt's his wife. It's your day, but there will be consequences", "ESH. It wasn\u2019t right for them to not include you in their wedding, but at least you and your BF were able to sit together. At least give your dad the option of sitting in the second row with his wife. You said he pitched in for your wedding. How much did he pitch in percentage wise? Will they be able to sit together during dinner? Also, you put \u201cmy dad and her\u201d in quotes to insinuate that only your dad is helping financially when they\u2019re married and that money is also hers.

You are there as the Grooms guest and on the grooms side - if she and Dad divorced tomorrow you wouldn\u2019t give a damn about her. So your place is unambiguously the grooms side.\n\nThe bridal party isn\u2019t assorted female relatives, it\u2019s women closest to *the bride*. You said yourself you two aren\u2019t particularly close, you aren\u2019t fond of her and don\u2019t have a good relationship, let alone that of bonus mom and daughter. So you wouldn\u2019t be one of the closest people to the bride, that would be her sister and her best friends - the women who love her most, not someone who doesn\u2019t like her much and probably isn\u2019t thrilled to be at this wedding. You had absolutely no reason to expect to be a part of the bridal party, and with all the bad blood between you two be honest: you\u2019d have hated it.\n\nYou should have been more involved on your fathers side however, given a reading or seated with his other family members. He could have made you a best woman. He is the one who should have insisted you sit with the rest of his family when seating plans were discussed. He is the one who should be gunning to have you in all the photos, because you\u2019re his kid, and he let you down on that front. It\u2019s clear from this you and stepmother both tolerate each other for your fathers sake. Let\u2019s be real, even if this wedding issue didn\u2019t come up, would you be pushing to have lots of pictures of her at your wedding? Would you have given  her ANY role in yours except the bare minimum of seating her next to your father at the dinner because they\u2019re a couple and couples tend to sit together regardless of if one\u2019s in the party or not?\n\nYour father excluded you from his wedding, not her. If she did, her role was in abetting your fathers exclusion.\n\nYou can seat her where you want, but usually couples are seated together so this feels like it was chosen specifically to be a jab\u2026 especially since you can\u2019t really snub her by not including her in any role because you\u2019d never have given her one and she\u2019d have never expected one. But it\u2019s your wedding and owe her nothing.

I mean that if she is going to pitch a fit about not being included or seated with your father there would be several solutions:\n\n1)  You will need to refuse all financial help from your father.  That you change your entire wedding plans where his money is no longer part of the equation and thus eliminating any of that say or ability to say anything.  And to prevent them from holding it over your head.\n\n2)  The question still remains, does your father have to walk you down the aisle?  I mean if you are not wanting his financial support, eliminate the father/daughter dance, and that part where he walks and gives you away.  This way he can be seated with his wife, though no longer in the front row.\n\n3)  Now this is going to be unpopular, but refuse/return the money and then just uninvite both of them.  There is no amount of money, no amount of being in good with anyone where it would equate out to the stress that she is going to have.\n\nAnd if she is going to rock the boat to get what she wants, you also should know that eloping and a court house wedding can work just as well, where you invite a few people to witness and avoid alot of that drama.\n\nTalk to your fiance about this and then time to talk to your father,", "NTA, tell your dad she's lucky she got an invite.", "NTA but really just here to say how sorry I am, OP.

You\u2019re taking it out on the wrong person.\n\nYou weren\u2019t at the wedding to support her - you would never speak to her again if she divorced your father - you were there to support your father and he\u2019s the one who cast you aside", "You have the comment of the day.", "I disagree.

I hate being in weddings. I was forced to stand next to my dad when all I wanted was to sit in the back). \n\nAs for seating arrangements it is rude to split up spouses. I understand you don\u2019t consider Mary family and I wouldn\u2019t either but she is your dad\u2019s wife. She should be treated accordingly. That means spouses sit together. Maybe have both of them in the third row instead. For reception it would be in poor taste to split them up as well.
