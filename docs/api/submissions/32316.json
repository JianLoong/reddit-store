There are so many rules I don\u2019t even get that I need to understand before I start non-reving. \n\nI don\u2019t think my dad realizes how much of a responsibility this privilege comes with and he tends to be neglectful of rules and I\u2019m almost certain he and/or his wife (I.e my step-mom) are going to break the cardinal rule you just mentioned.  \n\nMy dad will just claim ignorance like it\u2019s no big deal.", "Dad is saving money by not paying for his own seat.  Instead of being grateful for that, he's demanding twice the amount of free stuff.  OP could want to use that benefit for someone else, for someone who has manners enough to be grateful, someone who doesn't treat OP like shit.", "Currently yes but by the time I start the job, likely no. \n\nWe had a discussion and he said I should probably move out once I graduate from college and start this job because I don\u2019t like her and he doesn\u2019t feel that I respect her enough.", "No I would not but a key concern is that there are a lot of rules and I fear they may break one of them and act like it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nI love and trust my dad more but my step-mom is not someone I am 100% familiar with.", "Not sure to be honest!", "So he can save money.", "Has he heard of the concept \"take it or leave it\"? It's free, he doesn't get to dictate terms.", "My family is also in the airline industry and gets non-rev privileges. The people you put on your list are a reflection of you as an employee, and if anyone acts inappropriately while on a non-rev flight, you can lose your job. Definitely don't add anyone unless you 1. Want them to have the privilege, and 2. Trust that they won't do anything stupid. \n\nDefinitely NTA here.", "He is absolutely being entitled . If his wife doesn't get free flights he doesn't want free flights? Was that a threat ? Negotiating from a very clear position of weakness? \n\nYou're answer should be : ok dad no problem. End of conversation. When he kicks off and he will, act confused . This is what you asked for dad . You said if your wife didn't get free travel then you don't want it either. And since wife is NOT getting free travel I took you at your word . Unless ofc dad you really did want free flights but were trying to manipulate me in to doing what you want? Is that what you were doing dad, manipulating me? That was quite a gamble now wasn't it dad? So to recap dad your wife isn't getting free flights and neither are you.", "Most of my in-laws work for United and get benefits. NTA. My best friend is a supervisor and I don't even have benefits lol. Her sister gets priority. Maybe give her buddy passes?", "Don't. If he or his wife throw a tantrum at the airport, and either one are on your benefits, you could lose your flight benefits, or even your job.\n\nThere's someone close to me that I never put on my benefits because she has a tendency to go off, and I couldn't trust that her temper wouldn't flare if a flight got full and she had to wait for the next one.", "What's the difference if he pays for her flight ? Since she is his wife anyway, just say you offered her the flight and he has to pay for himself. It has nothing to do with her job situation, he seems like a rat too, wanting freebies everywhere", "NTA.  Like you said your dad is entitled.  Those are your benefits.  You get to decide who, if anyone gets to use them.  What is he giving you in return?  She's jobless so he has to pay all her costs.  There's an easy way to fix that, it's called a job.  He's really going to refuse free flights if you don't give your pass to her?  Sure.", "I wouldn't. If your in-laws are kind to you, give it to them instead.", "Go back in time and don't tell him the details of your job privileges", "And he is already saving money, because he only has to pay for her tickets", "Most people would be thrilled with what basically amounts to a \u2018buy-one-get-one-free\u2019 situation with airfare. \n\nNTA\u2026he\u2019s being extremely entitled and ungrateful at this point.", "I was just like, erm dad don\u2019t math gud?", "Sure. Sounds like she's got time.", "This is VITAL information, tbh.", "That is a reasonable concern. If they broke the rules, what would be the consequences? Would they simply lose those privileges or would it have negative repercussions for you? If it is the former, I would simply add them both and let them know what the guidelines are and the consequences for breaking them. If they do, it's on them. If it's the latter, I would have a talk with your dad about the reasons for not adding them. But, really, I don't think you can trust your dad and not her in this specific thing: if they're traveling together, I don't know if there's a situation where he would stick to the guidelines and she wouldn't.", "I\u2019d say attempting and failing lol", "One free ticket isn't good enough? That's fine. Enjoy paying for two.", "I like how your username matches point 2 when masks were required on planes.\n\nYea there are SO many rules that I am almost certain my dad and step-mom won\u2019t handle it and think it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nEven I don\u2019t know all the rules yet (but that\u2019s cuz I haven\u2019t started) and I fear I might break one, though not intentionally.", "Sounds like dad will not pass #2.", "I love him and all and want to give him the privileges because it saves money for \u201cus\u201d so he\u2019s trying to guilt trip me into giving it to her.", "Exactly what I said in another comment.", "I only live at home during breaks. Other than that, I stay on campus.", "It\u2019s potentially both. If you look at other comments and the non revenue travelers community, everyone says I can even face consequences including losing my job. \n\nMy dad is not a very good rule follower and my step mother could be entitled. My dad told me once she got upset when he would not buy her a Louis Vuitton bag because \u201che doesn\u2019t understand women\u201d.", "The father is betting that if he refuses to take the benefit for himself alone his kid will back down and give the benefit to both the father and the SM. \n\nHe thinks the threat of not accepting the benefit will scare his son into extending it to his wife.", "Most airlines have very specific conduct rules for any nonrev travel and all that travel is done on standby. If your father and stepmother are already behaving poorly now when discussing potential options then it seems their behavior might be an issue in the future were you to give them flight privileges. I know several people that lost flight benefits for a year because of how relatives using their benefits behaved towards flight attendants and customer service agents. When I worked for the airlines I chose not to put my sister on my benefits because she was young and I didn\u2019t trust she\u2019d follow all of the rules about when you can bring through security. I wouldn\u2019t even list your dad on the benefits since it seems likely he\u2019d behave poorly.", "Do not risk losing your privileges by adding any people with a sense of entitlement -- such as your father. Airlines are quite strict about free flyers and how they behave, especially since seats can suddenly vanish and they have to be able to adapt politely to change. \n\nIf any of your designated people act up in any way, you can lose your privileges yourself. Dole them out sparingly, and only to those you can trust. This is your job and reputation on the line. Do not be pushed. \n\nNTA", "Maybe he shouldn't have married someone who doesn't work and then she could pay her own way.", "Is he contributing anything at all to college or living expenses?", "Ooof. If that' the case, do you think adding your father would be wise? I think keeping them both out, might be better than adding just your father.", "Exactly. OP should just give the free flights to his bffs. As was said in the post, he can't dictate his dads marriage AND HE can't dictate who gets the free flights. NTA and give it to someone who isn't trying to seeing arm ya OP", "Allllllll of this.\n\nI had these privileges through my mum who was an FA while I was late teens - early 20s. She drilled it into me that I was expected to behave a certain way and that whatever was said, went. \n\nI learned the etiquette required as a stand by passenger and made it a point to be unfailingly polite and courteous. Mum flew me home to visit quite often, and so I got to know quite a few employees during this time whom were always happy to see me and would make sure my trip was smooth as possible. I could show up with my guitar in a soft case and they'd tuck it into their staff coat closet on board with no fuss. Bringing treats also helped a lot.\n\nMum also taught me that when you land, to cross the seat belts back together once everyone leaves. I'd make a point to hang back to do a few rows before deplaning and I can't tell you how happy it makes the FAs to get a little bit of help to do that turnover. \n\nOP, I wouldn't be giving these privileges to your dad and step mum whatsoever because they -will- be abused.", "He is but she\u2019s not. Why does it matter? I\u2019m already willing to offer the privilege to him to help him.\n\nHe choose to marry her and bear the cost of having her as his wife so does that mean I have to help support that? \n\nAlso, any bad behavior falls back on me and I don\u2019t want to risk my job over this!", "I don\u2019t think so but I presume he would get upset if I don\u2019t. \n\nHe\u2019s gonna act like breaking a rule is not a huge deal and claim ignorance.", "Apparently the dad thinks he's holding a .357 when in reality it's one of those rubber-band guns that sting just a bit.", "You're awfully judgemental for someone who's also being supported by him.\n\nI know you don't like her. For all I know she's the absolute worst. You don't have to give her your benefits if you want to do something else with them. But there's a BIG difference between \"step mom isn't my first choice\" and \"I'm not giving this to step mom even though I don't have a different idea just because I want to punish her\". \n\nDad's an adult. He can marry anyone who wants. Your childishness is ultimately not hurting anyone but yourself.", "That's also reasonable, but won't he also get upset if you don't include his wife? If what you want is to appease him, I'm not sure adding only him will cut it, based on what you told us about him.\n\nIf keeping your father happy is your priority, I think you should add them both. If not dealing with possible negative repercussions of his rulebreaking is your priority, then I think you should add neither of them. \n\nIn my opinion, adding just him gives you the worst of both worlds: he'll still be mad because you didn't add his wife AND you might get into trouble because your father doesn't follow the rules.", "Well she does have a bit of entitled behavior too. \n\nIn one of my other comments, she got mad at my dad for not buying her a Louis Vuitton bag. \n\nI can only imagine how she\u2019s going to feel if she doesn\u2019t get the flight or seat she wants and that\u2019s going to cost my job."]}
