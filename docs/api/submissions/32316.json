It's the WHY part that we're here for.\n\nSo. Why, OP?", "NTA, but bear in mind that you're completely hobbling the gift to him by denying it to her. Most married people travel as couples. If they can't afford to pay her air fare, he's hardly ever going to use it.\n\nYou might be better off sharing the passes with a couple of friends who can \"gift\" you some cash in return.", "INFO:\n\nYou get to give this privilege to two parents. If you withhold it from your MIL, can you give it to somebody else instead? Or will it just go unused? Does if go to your friend instead? The wording was a little unclear. \n\nIf you can give it to a friend instead and would prefer to, then that is up to you. It is your job and your benefit to give to who you choose. Your dad should be grateful that future flights as a couple will cost half as much when you could've given it to two friends. \n\nHowever if this category is only for parents and it will just be wasted so you can score points against a MIL you don't like, this may be satisfying in the short-run but is really quite petty and will cause more problems in the future. Is it really worth damaging your relationship with your dad?", "YTA. Sure, they're your privilege to share, or not - but all you're doing is punishing your dad for marrying someone you don't like. That just seems petty and spiteful.\n\nUnless I misunderstand the privilege system and you'd be giving up flight vouchers or discounts for her use; then you might have a point. But if you're just withholding something that costs you nothing because you don't like your stepmom, then yes, you're the AH here.", "I don't think you are TA but I think it was silly of you to get into this, you could have kept quiet about the details of the scheme. \n\nYou dad is also being an AH. IF you give him a free flight and his wife has to pay, then as a couple they are still effectively getting the flight for half price. \n\nIf the actual rules are that you can have 2 people to whom you can give the friends and family offer, then say to your dad that you only have one such 'pass' available, you've already given the second one to someone else , does he want it or not? IF he sys yes, give it to him, and how he and his wife split any other costs is up to them, if he says no, accept his choice and give the privilege's to another friend \n\nYou would be the Ah if you don't have anyone else you want to share with, so you are withholding it purely becasue you don't like her and it is otherwise not going to be used at all, although it was still daft to give your dad all the details , and I don't think you would be wrong to withdraw your offer to him in light of his entitled attitude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
