She had no contact with her biological mother; I am technically her stepmother, but I raised her from the time she was 6, and she called me Mom. I loved her so much, and I'm still reeling from this loss, as is my husband. \n\nWe recently boxed up her things and donated her furniture, but we kept her clothes, shoes, makeup, posters, all of her personal items. They're still in boxes in her room. The main thing is her toy collection; she had an extensive collection of Monster High, Ever After High, Barbie, and Madame Alexander dolls. My husband has displayed her favorite dolls in our living room, and the rest are boxed up. \n\nLast week, my mother spent the weekend with us. She noticed the dolls in the living room, and when my husband wasn't around, told me that one of the Barbies was worth hundreds of dollars. I didn't like the way she said it, so I ignored her, but she kept bringing it up. Eventually, she outright asked if I would sell it, and some other dolls, because my brother \"needs\" the money.\n\nMy brother has always been the golden child. He's also a trainwreck. He's constantly asking for money, can't hold a job, and lives with my parents, who enable him. What does he need the money for? Buying another used car after he wrecked his last one, so he can get to his current job. I refused outright.\n\nMy mother is mad at me, she insists I'm being selfish and refusing to help my brother. She says if he loses this job because he can't get to work, it's my fault for not pitching in to help my \"real\" family. My husband wants to cut my parents off after this request; this isn't the first time they've insulted my family or my daughter's memory, but it's the most outrageous example by far.\n\nMy sister, though, is saying that holding onto the dolls won't bring my daughter back. She says I should help out just this once, because apparently our brother is \"actually trying really hard\" at this job, and it could be what he needs to turn his life around. I will not sell the doll, but I'm not sure if I'm the AH for that.

Right now having these things, these memories is what holds you together. And how long you need them for is up to you and her dad. Maybe you\u2019ll keep a couple forever, maybe all or maybe none.

It's not worth losing your husband over your \"real family\".", "Agreed. OP, please get all the dolls appraised for insurance (I know its not about the money and if anything does happen to those dolls maybe the insurance payout could be donated in your daughters name to a charity she would have approved of).\n\nBefore that gets done, DO NOT LET ANY OF YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOUSE. Your bio family has shown you who they really are, believe them, and do not let them in your house ever, nor should they be around your husband, it is clear your family is seeing dollar signs in his grief and that behaviour is disgusting. \n\nNTA for your question, but you will be one of you let your family back in that house because they can't be trusted.", "I would also recommend getting a locked display case.", "There are locking display cabinets. Maybe worth getting?", "And even if one day, you were to sell why should you give the money to a deadbeat brother? Who will no doubt need more a month later? They were your daughter's and you should do whatever you think her wishes would have been. I'm sorry for your loss.", "And get a camera if feasible\n\nMfs are gonna try to get a mold for a new key", "At this point I'd just rekey the locks if any of OP's family have a key. You have no idea if they've made copies. Change or rekey the locks, and ban these fucking monsters from the house.\n\nPoor OP's daughter passed away 6 MONTHS ago. I cannot believe these ghouls slavering after her treasured possessions."]}
