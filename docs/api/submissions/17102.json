She had no contact with her biological mother; I am technically her stepmother, but I raised her from the time she was 6, and she called me Mom. I loved her so much, and I'm still reeling from this loss, as is my husband. \n\nWe recently boxed up her things and donated her furniture, but we kept her clothes, shoes, makeup, posters, all of her personal items. They're still in boxes in her room. The main thing is her toy collection; she had an extensive collection of Monster High, Ever After High, Barbie, and Madame Alexander dolls. My husband has displayed her favorite dolls in our living room, and the rest are boxed up. \n\nLast week, my mother spent the weekend with us. She noticed the dolls in the living room, and when my husband wasn't around, told me that one of the Barbies was worth hundreds of dollars. I didn't like the way she said it, so I ignored her, but she kept bringing it up. Eventually, she outright asked if I would sell it, and some other dolls, because my brother \"needs\" the money.\n\nMy brother has always been the golden child. He's also a trainwreck. He's constantly asking for money, can't hold a job, and lives with my parents, who enable him. What does he need the money for? Buying another used car after he wrecked his last one, so he can get to his current job. I refused outright.\n\nMy mother is mad at me, she insists I'm being selfish and refusing to help my brother. She says if he loses this job because he can't get to work, it's my fault for not pitching in to help my \"real\" family. My husband wants to cut my parents off after this request; this isn't the first time they've insulted my family or my daughter's memory, but it's the most outrageous example by far.\n\nMy sister, though, is saying that holding onto the dolls won't bring my daughter back. She says I should help out just this once, because apparently our brother is \"actually trying really hard\" at this job, and it could be what he needs to turn his life around. I will not sell the doll, but I'm not sure if I'm the AH for that.

Right now having these things, these memories is what holds you together. And how long you need them for is up to you and her dad. Maybe you\u2019ll keep a couple forever, maybe all or maybe none.

Wow that is incredibly rude! Who walks around a home (grieving or not) looking at the value of things to sell??? \n\nFirst things first....Never make any big decisions in the first year of grief. Even if you find yourself wanting to sell those items it's much too soon to for anyone to suggest such a thing! These dolls are on display in your living room, they obviously hold sentimental value to you. While it's true that the dolls won't bring her back they evoke a powerful memory of what once was. Hold onto them as long as they continue to bring you and your husband joy. You don't owe anyone any explanations or financial support.\n\nIf your brother looses his job it is of his own doing. Nobody is responsible for his actions   outside of himself.", "NTA. It's not your job to fund your brother, and it's frankly disgusting that anyone would even ask.

If the brother is in need of money, would they come and request it outright if they knew nothing of the dolls? I fear not. They see the dolls as an easy way to free up some cash to front the brother this time around. To beat the behaviour - I\u2019d just say I didn\u2019t pay for them, husband did, and he says no.

Pressuring you to sell the dolls for cash, which is for your brother, from the most precious things left you have of your very recently deceased daughter. No sane, moral, ethical person thinks any of those things much less all of them at once. Your birth family is highly dysfunctional to the point I\u2019d absolutely advise siding with your husband and cut them off. He needs to be protected from your family by you! \n\nConsidering how brazenly your mother was eying those dolls I\u2019d go so far as to lock the dolls away. You might be able to get a display case like at the drugstore that displays the dolls behind clear plastic so you can see and enjoy them but has a lock and requires a key to open it. I know it sounds extreme, but your mother is the type of person I wouldn\u2019t put anything past. You should beware.", "NTA and lock those dolls away from her before she steals them", "No, NTA. Your mother and sister however are extremely entitled here and are being incredibly disrespectful and rude. I'd keep the dolls in a safer place if I were you.", "NTA, and make sure they don't have keys to your place so those dolls can't go \"missing\".

We cannot sell what doesn\u2019t belong to us. She was your husbands biological daughter and as her actual parent he should decide what\u2019s done with her things.

You could donate them. You could sell them and use the money for a charitable donation in her memory; you could do something nice for yourself.  You could put it away for your own retirement planning.
