She had no contact with her biological mother; I am technically her stepmother, but I raised her from the time she was 6, and she called me Mom. I loved her so much, and I'm still reeling from this loss, as is my husband. \n\nWe recently boxed up her things and donated her furniture, but we kept her clothes, shoes, makeup, posters, all of her personal items. They're still in boxes in her room. The main thing is her toy collection; she had an extensive collection of Monster High, Ever After High, Barbie, and Madame Alexander dolls. My husband has displayed her favorite dolls in our living room, and the rest are boxed up. \n\nLast week, my mother spent the weekend with us. She noticed the dolls in the living room, and when my husband wasn't around, told me that one of the Barbies was worth hundreds of dollars. I didn't like the way she said it, so I ignored her, but she kept bringing it up. Eventually, she outright asked if I would sell it, and some other dolls, because my brother \"needs\" the money.\n\nMy brother has always been the golden child. He's also a trainwreck. He's constantly asking for money, can't hold a job, and lives with my parents, who enable him. What does he need the money for? Buying another used car after he wrecked his last one, so he can get to his current job. I refused outright.\n\nMy mother is mad at me, she insists I'm being selfish and refusing to help my brother. She says if he loses this job because he can't get to work, it's my fault for not pitching in to help my \"real\" family. My husband wants to cut my parents off after this request; this isn't the first time they've insulted my family or my daughter's memory, but it's the most outrageous example by far.\n\nMy sister, though, is saying that holding onto the dolls won't bring my daughter back. She says I should help out just this once, because apparently our brother is \"actually trying really hard\" at this job, and it could be what he needs to turn his life around. I will not sell the doll, but I'm not sure if I'm the AH for that.
