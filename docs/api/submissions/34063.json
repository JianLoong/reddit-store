You deserve to have a relationship with a sibling without any parental garbage getting between you.", "NTA. It is unfair that your dad\u2019s mess continuously puts you in uncomfortable situations. In all honesty, though, what did you expect? Your two older brothers have nothing to do with the half-sister, and you do, to the point of meeting up. Of course, your mother is going to ask you for additional questions and the guise is as needing closure. You were the one telling her all of this information about connection, communication, meeting up, etc. Hang out with your sibling but don't blabber your mouth.
