Are we talking the flu or hospitalized or terminal or\u2026?\n\nEdit: Good gods, you\u2019re demanding your mother attend your wedding when your sister\u2019s husband just died?!  That\u2019s not \u201cill,\u201d and it\u2019s a perfectly valid reason for people to not feel like celebrating.\n\nMy grandfather died 3 weeks before my wedding.  We decided to continue, because he\u2019d been near death for months.  It was a bit of a surprise, because he had been on the road to recovery - survived the bad surgical infection, and was getting ready to transfer to a rehab facility when he aspirated and developed pneumonia, and he was still so weak from months of battling that infection that he went very quickly.  Got diagnosed with pneumonia and died 2 days later.\n\nWe went ahead partly because it was what my family wanted, including my grandmother.  We\u2019d had a very rough 2 years - my younger cousin died suddenly and unexpectedly before reaching her 30th birthday 2 years prior, and there had been major surgeries and in-law deaths (my cousin\u2019s mother\u2019s family), and my family wanted something good to happen.  A number of us had a few tears here and there that day, missing people who should\u2019ve been there, but on the whole it was still a much-needed celebration.  My grandma said that my husband and I had taken too long getting to the wedding to delay it farther.  My uncle (my dead cousin\u2019s father) wept at my wedding because he was in such desperate need of something good in his life, and my whole family loves my husband and had been waiting for us to finally tie the knot.\n\nYour family is hurting and grieving and not in a place where they are ready to celebrate.  If you want to go ahead, you need to respect that and let people attend or not as it meets their needs.  It would be better to delay until your family is ready, but if you don\u2019t feel like you can do that, you at a bare minimum need to let people do what their grief dictates.", "INFO: is husband's illness terminal? like i feel like this is purposely vague.\n\nEDIT: good job leaving out the fact he LITERALLY DIED in your post. how is this favoring your sister?????

If you do have it, do something special for your dead family member (an empty chair and a speech). Think hard about the ins and out of changing the date (do you have a block of rooms reserved? How menu ppl are invited/coming from out of town? Have you asked your vendors about the possibility?). Maybe meet your mom halfway and ask her if a month is okay or something more.

Supporting a grieving family member is not favoring in ANY way. What a selfish bitch. You're mad that your sister's husband died because it was inconvenient for you? It's an extremely emotional time for everyone but for you to act like that is out of line. You do not deserve family support for the lack of support you've shown during the situation at hand. What if your partner died? You wouldn't be able to even eat, sleep, breathe let alone celebrate a union days after the fact when your other half passed on.

OP is NOT coming off as a sympathetic character.  However\u2026\n\nOP should have been clearer about the situation. I think the Reddit nation is a tad peeved by how OP presented this.  So let\u2019s look at all sides. \n\nBIL died of a heart attack between a week ago and a few days.  Exact timeline is unknown.  Mom is with Kate and grandchild to support them as she should be right now.  It is tragic.  I\u2019m interested in how old BIL was.  It\u2019s all so sad. \n\nWedding is next week.  So\u2026. Wedding is probably ten days or so post death of BIL.  We all know that postponing or canceling a planned wedding has so many layers and complications.  Basically impossible at this late date and could have huge financial implications.  OP could be in a panic about all this and has not quite phrased her position in the best way.  Brides are a bit \u201cmuch\u201d without a family death added in.  \n\nIt is not unrealistic to have a wedding within ten or so days of a family death.  Parents can still attend. A few hours could be spent at the already planned wedding. Kate can still attend or choose not to.  No one could fault her.   A planned wedding - especially with deposits and invitations and other guests involved-  can easily go on ten plus days post death of BIL. Not optimum be any means, but reasonable.  \n \nFuneral could be planned for the next day since family should already be in the area. Being a pragmatic, travel is minimized for out of town relatives. And BIL could be properly honored. \n\nJust some thoughts.  Again - OP is NOT presenting herself in the best light.  Had she phrased It differently, I do think the responses would have been slightly different.  \n\nI\u2019m withholding judgement and hoping OP clarifies some points and shows a bit more humanity.", "I really like that idea. \nPlus I'm sure everyone will be more than understanding. \nShe can still have a winter wedding in January or next year if she wants December.\n\nI wonder what her fiance thinks \ud83e\udd14", "I really want to have your belief in humanity. Given that Op omitted the death even in her edit it is safe to say she knew what she was doing. Faking the text to garner support. \n\nIsn\u2019t there even a rule about posts being truthful? Op is lying through her teeth. Death is not an illness.", "genuinely curious as to what you do for a living that allows you to have this much pragmatism. OPs insane selfishness and deliberate concealment of info has sent me into a blind rage", "I hope you get bed bugs and all your nails fall out.", "Oh my god, wtf. You LIED and said he\u2019s ill in your post when actually he has died. What is wrong with you. Get into therapy.", "YTA. Do you not have a heart?!?!?", "You are disgusting and absolutely heartless.
