One of our daughters, \u201cAmy\u201d (13F), is a big Swiftie. Like everyone else, I\u2019ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get tix to take Amy to the Eras tour.\n\nThe other day, Sam messaged Amy to say that his current wife, \u201cLiz\u201d had a friend on Facebook who was selling tickets. Amy called me very excited asking if we could buy the tickets. A little annoyed he went straight to Amy instead of checking with me first, but never mind. \n\nI asked Amy to check exactly where Liz had seen the tickets for sale because I know there has been a lot of scams. Amy messaged Sam and he said it was all good because the seller wasn\u2019t a random, but an actual friend of Liz\u2019s. I then called Sam and re-iterated that there have been lots of FB scams with Swift tickets so was he sure it was legitimate. He assured me that it was fine because it was a friend of Liz\u2019s from uni who she knew well. Ok, then.\n\nLiz introduced me to the seller via FB messenger, and I sent the seller $1200 by bank transfer. I also booked flights for the show. Now here is where I was admittedly a bit silly. The seller contacted me again and said I needed to transfer another $400, which should\u2019ve been a red flag, but I did it because I thought this was someone Liz and Sam knew personally. \n\nWell, it was a scam. Someone had cloned Liz\u2019s friend\u2019s FB account. Liz messaged me to say she thought it might be dodgy, but it was too late. I later found out that Liz had seen the original post on a FB mum\u2019s group, NOT posted to her friend\u2019s personal page who she\u2019d been connected to for years. This is really frustrating because I\u2019d explicitly said these types of scams were happening. If I\u2019d known, I would\u2019ve double checked that they\u2019d called the friend, not just linked up through FB.\n\nSam and Liz said they felt terrible about it.\n\nLuckily, I was able to get a full refund on the flights, and my bank automatically put a hold on the $1200 because it was a large transfer so I could stop that, but the bank said the additional $400 could not be refunded.\n\nI messaged Sam explaining that in the end, I lost $400 and asked that since I was acting on information from him that it was legitimate, I was wondering if he would compensate me for the loss. (Tbh, I would\u2019ve been happy if he just paid for half of it).\n\nHe replied with. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I know you got scammed and that\u2019s unfortunate, but all we did was put you in touch with someone we thought had tickets.\u201d I\u2019m pretty annoyed that he\u2019s acting like he had no role in this loss, but maybe I\u2019m being unreasonable since maybe I should\u2019ve been more wary?", "created_utc": 1696321081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ym3lq/aita_for_asking_my_ex_to_cover_money_i_lost_in_a/", "score": 1201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely should cover at least some of what you lost.  \nAlso, he really should have spoken to you before Amy if you are the one paying for the tickets \u2013 he put you in a really awkward position where you were pressured to act on it.", "NTA\n\nThis is the fault of Sam and Liz and they should take responsibility for it.\n\n>but all we did was put you in touch with someone we thought had tickets\n\nWell that's a lie. They didn't just put you in touch. They repeatably said it was NOT a scam because it was a good friend of Liz. And Liz lied about how she heard about the tickets in the first place.", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldnt push it further. Sam isnt going to reimburse you, as he feels no responsibility for 'putting you in touch' with a scammer. That sucks tho.\n\nBut I would be extremely wary with Sam in future for EVERYTHING. And if he asks, just tell him that you no longer trust him because of the 'Swift debacle' where he wouldnt even cover half of the loss that was due to him setting you up with a scammer.", "To understand if they played a role in this you simply have to ask yourself one question. Would you have listened to your gut feeling and said no to paying the $400 had he not told your daughter first, getting her all excited? It\u2019s the easiest thing to stand back with hands up and say \u201cnot my problem\u201d. But, in this context, morally absolutely wrong.\nI believe you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.\nHe put you in touch AND assured you it was safe. He is the reason you got scammed. Though, maybe only ask for 200. He might be more willing to pay for it that way.", "So why wasn't he paying for half the tickets in the first place?", "It\u2019s going to be shown in cinemas starting October 13th.", "NTA. He would be liable in a court of law for introducing you to the seller and affirming their legitimacy. And, why isn\u2019t he paying half for his daughters enjoyment to start with?", "NTA, you asked him like 10 times if it was a scam and then Liz lied to you about where she saw the post. Somebody should pay you back something. Try to get half 100 from Sam and 100 from Liz.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty scummy. \n \nEven if this was a FRIEND of mine, and they\u2019d ask me a million times if it was legit, and I\u2019d been the one to convince them I would have offered half. \n\nI probably would have called the contact to help facilitate it - if friend had kept asking me - OR tell them I don\u2019t know this person personally so make sure everything\u2019s legit before handing over money.", "Splitting would have been reasonable.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy din'T LIZ do the transactions herself? Or Sam?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sam and Liz said they felt terrible about it.\" .. just hot air. Bullshit.", "ESH. Other people have already covered why your ex & his partner are TA\u2026 but you are also TA for sending a stranger on Facebook $1,600 without getting any kind of genuine confirmation. Did you even meet them in person, or do a video call first?\n\nAll three of the adults here share the blame of falling for this scam. \n\nWhat kind of message is this sending to your daughters? It would do them well if you sat them down and told them that what you did was wrong, and that they should never give away money if they aren\u2019t 100% confident about it, especially not to a stranger.", "Yeah the bozo should pay the full amount .. he said it was someone he actually knew. What?", "NTA OP. Your Ex or his wife could have sent a text if that friend is really selling the tickets and if they can put a hold on it. That would have cleared up everything rather quickly. You ask multiple times.", "NTA\n\nYou both fell for a scam and I think its only reasonable that he pays half the cost of what you have lost because it was on his suggestion that you tried to buy the tickets.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like he intentionally misled you but Liz could have and should have checked with her friend if the sale was real.", "NTA, and it does sound like he should pay half of the $400, but the bigger lesson is that you need to be much more cautious. I'm somewhat astounded how you ever thought that sending that much money to someone you've only communicated with on fb messenger is remotely sensible in any circumstance. It would have taken about five minutes to get Sam to ask Liz's friend to ring you to finalise it, at which point the scam would have been obvious. Hopefully this prevents you sending someone half your life savings in the future.", "ESH\n\nAnyone with scruples would cover at least half if not all of the $400\n\nbut jeez... the extra $400 was not a good move", "NTA Not only did he vouch for this person being 100% legitimate...he also told your daughter first instead of talking to you.\n\nWhy didn't he and Liz get ahold of her friend privately and ask about the tickets? If this is supposed to be somebody, she knew that well then that shouldn't have been a problem.", "You said yourself it should have been a red flag for the extra money (you just accepted the price going up???) and the extra money is all you are out.  I mean,  bank wire transfer is sketchy anyway but you only lost the part you definitely should have refused.    That was your mistake and YTA", "Esh\n\nSo you knew there were fb scams, but still chose to go through an unverified person and spent 1200 on *concert* tickets, then spent an additional 400 on the unverified thing, you never actually called the person demanding an additional 400 to find out why they needed it, and you weren't given the tickets immediately after the initial 1200?!\n\nYour ex and his wife are ahs for telling daughter about it and not telling you first that it looks like a friend *might* have tickets, and letting you get in contact with them and verify that info yourself, and obviously the hacker/ scammer is a huge ah, but come on, some of this is on you, the 400 was a huge red flag you should have questioned after your already paid 1200 and weren't given anything to show for it when you already knew people were running this exact scam.", "NTA.", "Makes sense why he is your Ex \ud83d\ude04", "ETAH. At the end of the day it\u2019s your money and you can\u2019t expect anyone else to do your due diligence for you.", "YTA. You knew about rampant scams on Facebook and when you got connected to the scammer you didn\u2019t do your due diligence. Like you knew this was coming. Triple check next time.", "Gentle YTA. You are only out the additional $400. Even being super aware of the scams. You STILL sent MORE money, ignoring that huge red flag. That\u2019s on you.", "First. Ex does not need permission from you to contact his daughter. Are you required to do the same? \n\nSecond, the money that would have gone to the tickets, didn\u2019t go through. The 400 you spent was admittedly your own stupidity. \n\nIf you were willing to flush 1200 dollars down the drain to see a concert\u2026. Huge waste of money. Then 400 dollar lesson on your own stupidity should be doable as well. You won\u2019t starve, and you won\u2019t buy stupid things like that online again right? \n\nYTA. Yes. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably an ex wife themselves and bitter lol. \n\n\n\nHe messed up, then you did, now you are out 400. Sucks but I agree with the ex. If it was so obvious then you shouldn\u2019t have sent the extra money.", "YWBTA It's a tough lesson, but ultimately, you made the decision to send the money. Next time, verify everything independently.", "YTA\n\nThe person was cloned", "Nta at least half and half. I totally get why he is an ex", "NTA. He totally vouched for the person, even not being sure himself. He should fully reimburse you. Show him the post so he can aee what an AH he is in this case.", "NTA. They vouched, so now they're on the hook for it.", "He essentially took responsibility for its legitimacy. If you were out the original $1200, I'd absolutely say he was responsible.  However,  you were able to block that.  You chose to send another $400 above the agreed on price, which is a huge red flag that you should have caught. And that's the money you're out. He would be reasonable to say he wasn't paying it for that reason.  But he's being d*ck about it and trying to say he didn't have any part in the situation,  so ESH.", "Nta", "YTA - The only money you are out is the additional money you foolishly sent bogus seller.  That's on you.  Don't blame your ex for your own mistakes.", "All the signs were there, you can't pass the responsibility of due diligence on to someone else. You only loss money on the last transaction which was so obviously dodgy too. YTA", "[removed]", "No wonder you dumped him. You're NTA to ask him to make right the wrong he caused.

No one's fault but your own I'm afraid.", "YTA. Go through a verified ticket reseller if you don't personally know the person for large purchases.

There is a saying, \"trust but verify.\" You knew all the signs yet still 1.) paid by bank transfer instead of venmo or something 2.) sent an additional $400 after recognizing that this was a huge red flag. For someone who claims to know everything about scams, it seems like you really don't. Or, more likely, you ***did*** know but convinced yourself it wasn't because you wanted it to be real against your better judgement.\n\nIMO, there are rare situations where vouching for someone would expose someone to any financial responsibility, so in this case it's hard to really blame them for getting scammed ***especially*** when Liz reached out as soon as she felt something was fishy.\n\nSo I would vote NAH, I'm sure Sam and Liz feel terrible, but it's hard to see why they should owe you $$ (especially when it's the $400 you sent in the second transfer), something they couldn't have even known about and which you admitted was a red flag you ignored.", "At the end of the day, \\*you\\* made the decision to send the money, then send more, regardless of what you were told about the \"seller.\" Everyone knows (even those not on Facebook) that accounts are prone to being hacked and people can be not who they say they are at times. Preying upon the desperate is what they do.\n\nIt'd be the same thing as if you get some shady tax accountant to prepare your return. \\*You\\* as the taxpayer are on the hook for the liability because without vetting the process (much like not vetting it here), you would have signed on the bottom line.\n\nEven legally I'm not sure there's much sympathy for you because again, you made the final decision and now don't want to take accountability for it. If something doesn't feel right, doesn't look right, or you want to follow up and ask questions, it falls on you, the currency holder, to do the due diligence on a verified transaction. Unfortunately $400 is a significant chunk of change to find this out the hard way, yet it could have been worse.

And then I ask about whether or not the guy is reliable, etc and you assure me that the guy is legit and you have known him personally for years.\n\nWhen you vouch for someone, then you are also putting your reputation on the line.", "Because the money she is out is because of her being stupid and sending extra money. Even if you do think it is partly his fault, what she actually lost is 100% on her.\n\nShe says she saw the red flags herself.", "Yes this !!!! Plus I feel like if I were in Liz\u2019s position and this large amount of money is being transferred on my word \u2014 I would be sure to get in touch w my friend personally whether on fb messenger or by call and just speak w them once.", "Of course we know that. But the point is they were tricked. It sucks and it's unfortunate, but they were misled. Are they foolish? Perhaps. Are they assholes? No, I don't think so. \n\nYou're right that there were other ways they should have verified, but it doesn't sound like OP asked them to do that. She asked if it was legit, Sam said it was Liz's friend, and OP was satisfied with that answer. And as far as he knew, he was right. And no, simply asking someone \"are you sure this isn't a scam\" is not due diligence. \n\nIf there were more details about Sam failing to do something that OP asked, then I would change my mind. But as far as I can tell, the only thing Sam and Liz are guilty of is  being fooled. OP had every opportunity to take additional steps to verify (like ask for a phone number or something) but did not, and they were the one that chose to go through with the sale. This is a key part, imo. If instead Sam paid for the tickets and asked for reimbursement from OP, then I would say he was on the hook. \n\nMy vote is still NAH. Everyone got tricked. There is a saying, trust but verify. OP and Sam trusted, but didn't verify.", "I mean, the details of the call matter. \n\nBut simply asking \"hey are you sure this isn't a scam\" is not due diligence. Everyone is saying well Sam should have called the friend or Sam should have done this or that,  but as far as we know OP never asked Sam to do that. As far as Sam knew, he was telling the truth. He was duped and was foolish, but so was OP.", "\\*friend of a friends shop. This is his wifes friend not his. And yes there can very much be a difference.   \n\n\nAnd yeah i did recommend it based on who i thought was the owner. But I hadn't been to she shop in a while and ownership has changed. I still pointed you to a shop I trusted. Is it my fault they sold to new guys that suck and i didn't know yet? He reasonably went by word of mouth on it being the legit account of a person he actually knows.   \n\n\nHe seemingly didn't get anything out of this but a headache. If I were him it'd just teach me to avoid this happening again, by never trying to help again.", "But also if you're transferring that amount of money from your account, wouldn't you ask for that person's phone number to talk to them in person first? Especially if you're so worried about scams?\n\nOP knew those scams are plenty out there, why did she trust a person she never met (Liz)? You could argue that her ex was trustworthy, but still why would you trust Liz just because HE says she's trustworthy, even thought you never met her and have no clue how well he knows her? That's too many what- ifs and OP definitely should have taken extra steps like asking for Lizs friends phone number or meet her in person. \n\nEspecially for the additional 400USD.\n\nIf Liz cannot call her or give OP the phone number... than she isn't actually friends with that person outside of FB, which than means no deal. Too risky for that amount of money.", "Yeah I agree they\u2019re not assholes for being misled \u2014 it\u2019s the refusal to take responsibility for their actions and placing the blame entirely on OP for that, that is where they become AH. \n\nIt sounds like OP verified multiple times to the extent she could without Liz putting her directly in touch with her friend and reiterated multiple times asking them \u201cis this legit\u201d and they took the guarantee on themselves that yes, they did check if it\u2019s legit. OP was definitely not satisfied w that answer but since Liz and Sam were providing that much info as well as their own guarantee \u2014 OP agreed. However they then reneged on their guarantee afterwards when they decided not to pay OP back for their mistake. Also Liz eventually did put OP in touch w the scammer, so she did directly facilitate the transaction as well, she said \u201chere OP this is my friend, purchase from them\u201d. \n\nSam failed to confirm w the friend, speak to them once, check the details of the ticket \u2014 something. Plus he failed to put him his own money for this. \n\nSam and Liz are guilty of giving their guarantee and then reneging. They were the ones who guaranteed this person to OP.", "I agree with NAH.\n\nIf OP would have asked Liz to phone that friend, or better get her phone number to call her herself, and she'd say \"yes, I did\" that would be an AH move.\n\nYou don't know that person, why would you trust them? You don't know how clever or stupid they are. You don't know how carelessness they are... you can't just assume they know how to double check an account for accuracy. That's foolish.", "There wouldn\u2019t have been any misunderstanding if one call had been made, it honestly didn\u2019t matter the details because Liz was portraying (and seemingly under the impression \u2014 if she wasn\u2019t in on the scam herself) that her friend was personally selling the tickets. So one call would have just been \u201chey friend, haven\u2019t spoken to you in a while, hope all is well \u2014 I\u2019d love to buy some of those Taylor swift tickets you\u2019re selling on your profile! but I know how the internet can be these days so wanted to speak to you personally\u201d \u2014 there was no situation of calling the friend and confirming whether or not it was a scam \u2014 the friend itself was the one selling them", "You're right. I think everyone just disagrees on who's responsibility was to call the friend, with most saying it's entirely Sam or Liz's fault for not making a call of some sort. \n\nMy point is that it should have been OP's responsibility to ask for a call or something, since OP was the one who was suspicious of scams. Or maybe some sort of mutual responsibility. In hindsight it's easy to say well Liz should have called her friend, but at the time she had no reason to doubt the profile, which is further exacerbated by the fact that this was communicated through Sam and not Liz.\n\nPart of the problem is this is like a game of telephone where I think the concerns weren't really properly communicated. If Liz had simply shared the original post with the tickets, then I think we would all agree that it would be entirely OPs fault, but because some details got lost in translation, it makes it seem less like her fault. But at the same time, how were Sam and Liz to know exactly what signs to look out for if OP didn't tell them? And are we to overlook the fact that OP also saw several red flags and ignored them herself? \n\nIt's just a really unfortunate situation with a bunch of could've and should'ves, but ultimately there is no malice on Sam's part. Both sides fell victim to a scam, so it's hard to single out Sam as the at-fault party here.", "Buy why is it Liz responsibility to call the friend? It isn't her money that's being in risk of being stolen?\n\nIt's OPs responsibility to make sure it's legit. So she should have asked for Lizs phone number and chat to her, than ask if she called her friend or if she could call her herself. We are talking about 1200USD, not 20USD. (And than another 400USD??? At that point it was completely OPs fault, as she says she knows it was dodgy, but still didn't bother to get either get Liz' or her friends phone number to double check??? Or ask for proof of the tickets? Or you know say \"this wasn't what was agreed? What's going on?\" Like how the F is that Liz' or Sam's fault?)", "Yes I agree there was a dropped ball here where someone needed to make a phone call to Liz\u2019s friend \u2014 now considering it\u2019s HER friend, I personally feel it was Liz\u2019s responsibility to do that, others may feel differently. OP expressed her suspicions but Sam and Liz took on the guarantee themselves by telling OP essentially \u201cdon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s an old friend\u201d \n\nI DEF agree that this whole issue is caused by everyone communicating in a circle and getting nowhere. I don\u2019t think Sam and Liz were expected to look out for specific things, but just in general they could have reached out personally and sent one FB message ? Made one phone call and spoken to this person ? All they had to do was communicate. Instead they portrayed it to OP as they had spoken w this person, when in reality they had just read a general post. \n\nWhere I think the AH part comes in, and where Sam is malicious, is in his intent wherein he wants to be able to get all the credit for these tickets if it had turned out well and not been a scam, but when it didn\u2019t work out he\u2019s placing the entire blame on OP when clearly he dropped the ball, or at least his wife who you can assume is his representative, this is one of OP\u2019s co-parents as well so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much a question of \u201ctrusting this unknown person\u201d, I mean now Liz is in the family if she and Sam are married. Also I think Sam is a dick for not paying for the tickets in the first place, he should have at least split the cost w OP.", "Because it\u2019s Liz\u2019s friend, she is the one with the relationship with this person who is the source of the ticket. If she didn\u2019t have a relationship w them, OP wouldn\u2019t know about these tickets, and if she did she would have thoroughly vetted the source herself and would not be in the situation she is now bc clearly she knows how to tell a scam. Or maybe not, we\u2019ll never know now. \n\nOP and Liz don\u2019t have a relationship, OP and Sam do. As co-parents and former partners, so OP has to trust that Sam will do everything in the best interest of their child. Sam spoke on behalf of himself and Liz since they are married, and he is the one who has the relationship with and therefore communicates with. What if OP and Liz don\u2019t have a relationship? Maybe they don\u2019t talk for whatever reason ?", "You are making a ton of assumptions and judgements based on information we don't have. \n\nBased on the the post, the only thing that Sam confirmed was that this person was Liz's friend. Which was 100% true as far as he knew. It's not clear that OP ever voiced specific concerns beyond that.\n\nI do agree there are other aspects to Sam that aren't very good, like contacting Amy first and not offering to pay for the tickets in the first place, but those are irrelevant imo. Sounds like there was a good reason OP divorced Sam."]}
