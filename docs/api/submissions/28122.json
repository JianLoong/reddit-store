One of our daughters, \u201cAmy\u201d (13F), is a big Swiftie. Like everyone else, I\u2019ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get tix to take Amy to the Eras tour.\n\nThe other day, Sam messaged Amy to say that his current wife, \u201cLiz\u201d had a friend on Facebook who was selling tickets. Amy called me very excited asking if we could buy the tickets. A little annoyed he went straight to Amy instead of checking with me first, but never mind. \n\nI asked Amy to check exactly where Liz had seen the tickets for sale because I know there has been a lot of scams. Amy messaged Sam and he said it was all good because the seller wasn\u2019t a random, but an actual friend of Liz\u2019s. I then called Sam and re-iterated that there have been lots of FB scams with Swift tickets so was he sure it was legitimate. He assured me that it was fine because it was a friend of Liz\u2019s from uni who she knew well. Ok, then.\n\nLiz introduced me to the seller via FB messenger, and I sent the seller $1200 by bank transfer. I also booked flights for the show. Now here is where I was admittedly a bit silly. The seller contacted me again and said I needed to transfer another $400, which should\u2019ve been a red flag, but I did it because I thought this was someone Liz and Sam knew personally. \n\nWell, it was a scam. Someone had cloned Liz\u2019s friend\u2019s FB account. Liz messaged me to say she thought it might be dodgy, but it was too late. I later found out that Liz had seen the original post on a FB mum\u2019s group, NOT posted to her friend\u2019s personal page who she\u2019d been connected to for years. This is really frustrating because I\u2019d explicitly said these types of scams were happening. If I\u2019d known, I would\u2019ve double checked that they\u2019d called the friend, not just linked up through FB.\n\nSam and Liz said they felt terrible about it.\n\nLuckily, I was able to get a full refund on the flights, and my bank automatically put a hold on the $1200 because it was a large transfer so I could stop that, but the bank said the additional $400 could not be refunded.\n\nI messaged Sam explaining that in the end, I lost $400 and asked that since I was acting on information from him that it was legitimate, I was wondering if he would compensate me for the loss. (Tbh, I would\u2019ve been happy if he just paid for half of it).\n\nHe replied with. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I know you got scammed and that\u2019s unfortunate, but all we did was put you in touch with someone we thought had tickets.\u201d I\u2019m pretty annoyed that he\u2019s acting like he had no role in this loss, but maybe I\u2019m being unreasonable since maybe I should\u2019ve been more wary?", "created_utc": 1696321081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ym3lq/aita_for_asking_my_ex_to_cover_money_i_lost_in_a/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely should cover at least some of what you lost.  \nAlso, he really should have spoken to you before Amy if you are the one paying for the tickets \u2013 he put you in a really awkward position where you were pressured to act on it.", "NTA\n\nThis is the fault of Sam and Liz and they should take responsibility for it.\n\n>but all we did was put you in touch with someone we thought had tickets\n\nWell that's a lie. They didn't just put you in touch. They repeatably said it was NOT a scam because it was a good friend of Liz. And Liz lied about how she heard about the tickets in the first place.", "NTA\n\nBut I wouldnt push it further. Sam isnt going to reimburse you, as he feels no responsibility for 'putting you in touch' with a scammer. That sucks tho.\n\nBut I would be extremely wary with Sam in future for EVERYTHING. And if he asks, just tell him that you no longer trust him because of the 'Swift debacle' where he wouldnt even cover half of the loss that was due to him setting you up with a scammer.", "To understand if they played a role in this you simply have to ask yourself one question. Would you have listened to your gut feeling and said no to paying the $400 had he not told your daughter first, getting her all excited? It\u2019s the easiest thing to stand back with hands up and say \u201cnot my problem\u201d. But, in this context, morally absolutely wrong.\nI believe you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.\nHe put you in touch AND assured you it was safe. He is the reason you got scammed. Though, maybe only ask for 200. He might be more willing to pay for it that way.", "So why wasn't he paying for half the tickets in the first place?", "It\u2019s going to be shown in cinemas starting October 13th.", "NTA. He would be liable in a court of law for introducing you to the seller and affirming their legitimacy. And, why isn\u2019t he paying half for his daughters enjoyment to start with?", "NTA, you asked him like 10 times if it was a scam and then Liz lied to you about where she saw the post. Somebody should pay you back something. Try to get half 100 from Sam and 100 from Liz.", "NTA. That\u2019s pretty scummy. \n \nEven if this was a FRIEND of mine, and they\u2019d ask me a million times if it was legit, and I\u2019d been the one to convince them I would have offered half. \n\nI probably would have called the contact to help facilitate it - if friend had kept asking me - OR tell them I don\u2019t know this person personally so make sure everything\u2019s legit before handing over money.", "Splitting would have been reasonable.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy din'T LIZ do the transactions herself? Or Sam?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sam and Liz said they felt terrible about it.\" .. just hot air. Bullshit.", "ESH. Other people have already covered why your ex & his partner are TA\u2026 but you are also TA for sending a stranger on Facebook $1,600 without getting any kind of genuine confirmation. Did you even meet them in person, or do a video call first?\n\nAll three of the adults here share the blame of falling for this scam. \n\nWhat kind of message is this sending to your daughters? It would do them well if you sat them down and told them that what you did was wrong, and that they should never give away money if they aren\u2019t 100% confident about it, especially not to a stranger.", "Yeah the bozo should pay the full amount .. he said it was someone he actually knew. What?", "NTA OP. Your Ex or his wife could have sent a text if that friend is really selling the tickets and if they can put a hold on it. That would have cleared up everything rather quickly. You ask multiple times.", "NTA\n\nYou both fell for a scam and I think its only reasonable that he pays half the cost of what you have lost because it was on his suggestion that you tried to buy the tickets.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like he intentionally misled you but Liz could have and should have checked with her friend if the sale was real.", "NTA, and it does sound like he should pay half of the $400, but the bigger lesson is that you need to be much more cautious. I'm somewhat astounded how you ever thought that sending that much money to someone you've only communicated with on fb messenger is remotely sensible in any circumstance. It would have taken about five minutes to get Sam to ask Liz's friend to ring you to finalise it, at which point the scam would have been obvious. Hopefully this prevents you sending someone half your life savings in the future.", "ESH\n\nAnyone with scruples would cover at least half if not all of the $400\n\nbut jeez... the extra $400 was not a good move", "NTA Not only did he vouch for this person being 100% legitimate...he also told your daughter first instead of talking to you.\n\nWhy didn't he and Liz get ahold of her friend privately and ask about the tickets? If this is supposed to be somebody, she knew that well then that shouldn't have been a problem.", "You said yourself it should have been a red flag for the extra money (you just accepted the price going up???) and the extra money is all you are out.  I mean,  bank wire transfer is sketchy anyway but you only lost the part you definitely should have refused.    That was your mistake and YTA", "Esh\n\nSo you knew there were fb scams, but still chose to go through an unverified person and spent 1200 on *concert* tickets, then spent an additional 400 on the unverified thing, you never actually called the person demanding an additional 400 to find out why they needed it, and you weren't given the tickets immediately after the initial 1200?!\n\nYour ex and his wife are ahs for telling daughter about it and not telling you first that it looks like a friend *might* have tickets, and letting you get in contact with them and verify that info yourself, and obviously the hacker/ scammer is a huge ah, but come on, some of this is on you, the 400 was a huge red flag you should have questioned after your already paid 1200 and weren't given anything to show for it when you already knew people were running this exact scam.", "NTA.", "Makes sense why he is your Ex \ud83d\ude04", "ETAH. At the end of the day it\u2019s your money and you can\u2019t expect anyone else to do your due diligence for you.", "YTA. You knew about rampant scams on Facebook and when you got connected to the scammer you didn\u2019t do your due diligence. Like you knew this was coming. Triple check next time.", "Gentle YTA. You are only out the additional $400. Even being super aware of the scams. You STILL sent MORE money, ignoring that huge red flag. That\u2019s on you.", "First. Ex does not need permission from you to contact his daughter. Are you required to do the same? \n\nSecond, the money that would have gone to the tickets, didn\u2019t go through. The 400 you spent was admittedly your own stupidity. \n\nIf you were willing to flush 1200 dollars down the drain to see a concert\u2026. Huge waste of money. Then 400 dollar lesson on your own stupidity should be doable as well. You won\u2019t starve, and you won\u2019t buy stupid things like that online again right? \n\nYTA. Yes. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably an ex wife themselves and bitter lol. \n\n\n\nHe messed up, then you did, now you are out 400. Sucks but I agree with the ex. If it was so obvious then you shouldn\u2019t have sent the extra money.", "YWBTA It's a tough lesson, but ultimately, you made the decision to send the money. Next time, verify everything independently.", "YTA\n\nThe person was cloned", "Nta at least half and half. I totally get why he is an ex", "NTA. He totally vouched for the person, even not being sure himself. He should fully reimburse you. Show him the post so he can aee what an AH he is in this case.", "NTA. They vouched, so now they're on the hook for it.", "He essentially took responsibility for its legitimacy. If you were out the original $1200, I'd absolutely say he was responsible.  However,  you were able to block that.  You chose to send another $400 above the agreed on price, which is a huge red flag that you should have caught. And that's the money you're out. He would be reasonable to say he wasn't paying it for that reason.  But he's being d*ck about it and trying to say he didn't have any part in the situation,  so ESH.", "Nta", "YTA - The only money you are out is the additional money you foolishly sent bogus seller.  That's on you.  Don't blame your ex for your own mistakes.", "All the signs were there, you can't pass the responsibility of due diligence on to someone else. You only loss money on the last transaction which was so obviously dodgy too. YTA", "[removed]", "No wonder you dumped him. You're NTA to ask him to make right the wrong he caused.
