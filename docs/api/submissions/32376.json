I don\u2019t really mind or care as there\u2019s literally nowhere else for him to go right now but they want me (17f) to share a room with him. \n\nWe have 3 rooms, mom and dad\u2019s room, my room, and a room in the basement. No one uses that room so I assumed that\u2019s where he\u2019d be sleeping. But mom said no because Alex is scared of the dark and that specific room has no light. I told her to buy him a lamp but she got mad and said he\u2019s not sleeping in the basement. \n\nI asked her why, he\u2019s 14, not 4. She just said that I\u2019m being very difficult and he\u2019s just going to sleep in there so I need to get over it. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to share a room with a 14 year old boy and plus I have my boyfriend over a lot. Also I don\u2019t even know him and we\u2019ve never met before either.\n\nIt got really bad the night before Alex came. Mom kept talking about where they\u2019d put the mattress as if it was already decided so I told her again that I really don\u2019t want him sleeping in my room. She looked angrier than usual and told me that she\u2019ll make me sleep in the room in the basement and give him my room if I don\u2019t learn to cooperate. I told her that I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not going to let him into my room. Then I went to my room and locked the door. Some time later her and my dad asked me to open the door so they could put the mattress in but I refused. Mom got really mad again and said I\u2019m being extremely selfish. I told her I didn\u2019t care.\n\nI did the same thing tonight even though Alex was here as well and mom isn\u2019t talking to me anymore. Dad said he\u2019s really disappointed in me as well but I think he\u2019s just mad because they had to put the mattress in their room and that\u2019s where Alex slept. I refuse to budge on this though I do feel a little bad. Still, he can totally sleep in the basement, they\u2019re making it difficult for themselves.
