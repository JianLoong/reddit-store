They deserve better. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear if you\u2019re worried about the ketamine and alcohol mixing leading to an overdose or if you are just ratting her out as revenge for making your life harder. If you\u2019re genuinely concerned about the mixture of meds and alcohol then I would talk to your husband about it. \n\nI dont even know if a doctor\u2019s office would take an anonymous report and the last thing you want is you MIL finding out you\u2019re a rat because then she could tie you to the anonymous call to the ASPCA. \n\nExpect a world of fallout from reporting though since she will have the housing inspector called in and maybe be taken out of the house until she cleans it. Think about if she would land on your doorstep if she has nowhere else to live. \n\nIt takes therapy for these people to change. Therapy takes time. Nothing is going to snap her into taking care of it. Keep all this in mind. \n\nMaybe just tell your husband to go take the cats and give them to the shelter. Tell him that if he doesn\u2019t, you will report because it\u2019s unfair to the animals.", "Nta for reporting the animal abuse but soft YTA for reporting her to her doctor. \nThose cats deserve better and if you can get them to a more hospitable living arrangement, more power to you.\nHowever, your MIL sounds like she struggles with alcohol addiction. You reporting her to her doctor won\u2019t help her recover, it will just make her hide it more or it will cause her to lose access to mental health care. Yes, mixing ketamine and alcohol is not great but your intentions for reporting her seem less about preserving her safety and more about you feeling like she doesn\u2019t deserve treatment because she\u2019s an addict.", "In Italy they say \"do your own dicks\".\n\nIf the cats are in trouble, get them help. But calling the authorities just because you don't approve of wine/pill combos or whatever is for busybody assholes.\n\nSounds like the MIL is in a bad way and you don't have the resources to help. Be honest with yourself about that but don't transform her broken state into an insult against you. That's what an asshole would do.", "EHS, where does your husband stand on all this? Did he grow up in her house? Did he have cats as pets when he was a child? Is he a hoarder too? Your mil has issues that I hope your husband doesn't share. Why not check in on mil regularly and just change the cat box for her? Maybe offer to take a box of junk with you when you leave. You don't have to stay long and you don't have to be the cause of more problems.  Talk to her son and let him take the lead.", "NTA the cats need help.  As far as the ketamine I don't know what interactions there are but if it's dangerous then telling the doctor could help her.  Also, if this is some sort of drug trial it's important to follow the rules or she could skew the results.  For instance if she gets sick or first because of the drug combination with alcohol that could be called linked to the drug alone and it not approved for that reason, making it unavailable to others.

Her drug/alcohol combo is a problem for a few reason, first is that alcohol is a depressive, both mentally as well as being depressive to the nervous system so if she struggles with depressing (likely in part glide to the alcohol) add ketamine to that, it\u2019s a good way to stop breathing, plus if she\u2019s high/drunk and fall or stumbles into a pile she can literally be buried alive which won\u2019t end well.  Which is worse, telling on her and saving her life or letting her live her own life and being liked but have her die?  Seems like a bit of involvement may be in order but that\u2019s just my take.", ">Let her suffer\n\nYTA, where does this vitriol come from?", "No clean littler boxes *does* mean neglect, the cats are forced to live in an unsanitary and stressful environment. The cats deserve better", "It's a given the MIL ain't living healthy. But OP doesn't give a lot of signs they are coming from a good place on this. They sound out of patience and irritated, without a reassuring hint of what compassionate actions they've taken. Resorting to Authority (tm) in this instance MAY help (very long shot in the US where public services are threadbare) but it will take away MIL's autonomy and that's a lot to take on yourself from a place of annoyance.\n\nIf OP could talk with less judgement about the MIL it'd be more reassuring", "YTA for waiting. how long have those poor cats been subjected to that living situation? but suddenly, you want to report her??? wow", "Get help for the cats and call the city fire marshal about her living conditions.  She may be removed from the home until it is clean or it may be condemned.  Where will she go if that is the case.  You had better be prepared for that eventuality.", "NTA for reporting the cats. If she's doing the usual ketamine treatment then she is taking it in a supervised appointment so probably cannot actually drink while on K.", "Call Adult Protective Services as well as the Humane Society. Do not call her doctor.", "WNBTA.  I'm sorry about the hoarding.  I lived with a serious hoarder and when we developed bedbugs there was nothing to be done except a complete clean-out, which he wouldn't do.  We had the same animal problems, the same goat paths.  Eventually it was a large part of me leaving the marriage.\n\nAnimal neglect probably won't do anything.  The local health department may, because the individual may be personally endangered and the neighbors may endangered if a bug infestation occurs.  Unfortunately, hoarders don't respond well to medication or therapy and ordered clean-outs rarely result in the environment staying clean.  They either fill the space again or die.\n\nAs for the medication issue, tell the doctor.  My dad was taking medication for a heart problem but wouldn't tell the doctor he was an alcoholic.  I finally called the doctor, told him, and the doctor had a fit, because that completely affected the treatment.  He thanked me profusely for giving him the information and never told my dad that I had informed him.", "Soft ESH\n\nWould you be TA for calling animal control? No, no animal deserves to live in those conditions. However, reporting the medication is delving into the levels of being petty and reporting out of sheer spite. You can\u2019t force her to get better, in fact the issue is most likely going to make existing issues you have with her even worse. It is a sticky issue that you shouldn\u2019t be touching unless you have a significant reason such as, she\u2019s posing a threat to your child while doing this, she\u2019s attempted harm or theft to you, etc. \n\nOn a side note, after skimming through a few of your past posts, where is hubby in all of this? If he\u2019s not setting boundaries, then all of MIL\u2019s behaviors that are driving you up the wall are going to get worse. And is he onboard with reporting her? If he isn\u2019t and this is linked back to you in any fashion, this could very well spell disaster for your relationship. Maybe it\u2019s time to have a serious talk with him along the lines of \u201chey, MIL is very concerning and I don\u2019t feel safe having her near the LO while this is happening\u201d and start going LC/NC. \n\nIf he\u2019s not on board with boundaries, then your MIL problem is also undeniably an SO problem as well.", "I agree except for the \"soft\" part of YTA. OP is a malicious spiteful AH. \n\nI'm sure MIL is no peach, but OP is actively trying to kick somebody who is already in a horrible place."]}
