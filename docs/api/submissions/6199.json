Op Nta.", "Americans always seem to want to be exerting authority over each other. It\u2019s a weird controlling thing.", "In my ex\u2019s family it\u2019s only done at one house because they didn\u2019t have enough room. They set up a card table that was a little lower so that\u2019s where my kids sat so we didn\u2019t have to use boosters of any kind. My ex had a 30 something cousin in a wheelchair so the card table was just slightly better so that\u2019s where he sat. A teenage nephew and niece started sitting there when I married my ex because they adored my daughter. The card table was just an extension and everyone including the kids and teens were allowed to be a part of the conversation. My daughter was only 2 when I married so at first she was very silent. But after she got into school they purposely included her in the conversations. My youngest was a little more talkative and would say what she did in head start. The other relatives had big enough tables so then the kids sat by the parents for dishing up purposes. The wheelchair bound cousin still sat by my little ones.", "Space and food. Wine only at the adults table, a plate of carrot sticks and cucumber slices instead of the rocket and lamb lettuce salad at the kid's table.", "When my kids and necessary and nephews were toddler age and we had limited seating we set up a toddler table with toddler chairs for the littles with one or 2 adults supervising in rotation. As they got older they graduated to their own table because they wanted to talk about kid stuff and not be around the old people. However, they were always welcome to sit with the adults after toddler age", "For my family it was a space thing (main table didn't have enough seats, so the folding table was coming out anyway) and it allowed like to sit with like. It was never forced, and kids sat at the big table when there was enough space, but being at the kid table allowed us to hang out with the other kids and not be bored with the adults. It was never treated as a negative second-class citizen deal like the aunt in the post does.\n\nAnd yeah NTA, parents should be demanding an apology from the aunt. She treated OP horribly, doesn't matter if OP is 18 or not she'd owe anyone an apology for that.", "Kids table is way more fun than adults table! We never want to talk about the same things. I\u2019m in my 30s and now our parents want to sit at the kids table (aka my generation, the first grandchild won\u2019t be born until summer) but we don\u2019t want to sit with them! It is first and foremost a space issue, but it\u2019s also a more enjoyable way to spend that part of the meal", "The adults dump the babysitting on the oldest kid sitting at the kids table that\u2019s why. Auntie was miffed that OP wouldn\u2019t be the kids table babysitter anymore.", "My family used one when we were younger, but it was because the kids had special food made since we were all picky.", "In our family, the kids' table is shorter and has shorter chairs. So perfect for little ones.", "He needs to learn it's easier in the long run not to enable people like this.\n\nNTA", ">Apparently, she filled the aunts\u2019 group chat with passive aggressive remarks about me as well as calling me disrespectful and claiming I grew up with no discipline.\n\nYou'd nearly be tempted to give in to that request if it weren't for this detail you also added:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Apparently, she filled the aunts\u2019 group chat with passive aggressive remarks about me as well as calling me disrespectful and claiming I grew up with no discipline.\n\nYou should IMHO go back to your dad and tell him that you came home for the holidays to be with family, not get talked shit about in group chat. He can choose: You'll apologize but you're refusing to spend any holidays with them in future because they've shown you who really matters, \n\nor they can tell the Aunt to shove it and not to come back until she's apologized PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.", "No one needs to fight her. Just ignore her. Your dad doesn't need to be involved, he just needs to say \"take it up with OP, he's an adult and can speak for himself.\" \n\nI'm guessing this Aunt regularly stirs  up trouble and is used to people catering to her. The only thing that works with people like that is to ignore them.", "If you apologize then she will see herself as being in the right. You're an adult and can conduct yourself as one if you decide you want to apologize or not. I wouldn't. You're in college and you can drive, you aren't regulated to the kids table. Unless there were other teens/YA at that table too to talk to, you didn't mention if there was, if not then she can fuck off.", "Hell no!! you can\u2019t give insincere apologies for doing nothing wrong. Please don\u2019t set the precedent or you\u2019ll be doing it your whole life. She needs to learn to extend the same respect to you as she would any other adult.", "I understand  and nta  she was out of line does she do this all the time.", "GAH!! I just went to read it because of your comment specifically. Can't believe it. Awesome tho", "honestly my family did the kids table thing and it was great, you could talk about kids things, laugh loudly and tell jokes instead of hearing the adults talk . in my opinion if kids are on the same table the whole table devolves into kiddy talk or if strictly manners are being observed- it is really boring for the kids", "That's great for wherever over here is.  We've done separate tables over here (again primarily due to space,) and generally it isn't as much a problem as everyone seems to make it on this subreddit.", "They might want to call it that among them and get it. On the internet they had to explain it, otherwise we would think they were sitting there with the rest of the five year olds. Doesn't make a lot of sense to call it that among strangers.", "The edit where OP mentions he set the places and made sure there were enough makes me wonder what else OP helped with. Even just handling the place setting is a non-trivial contribution, so aunt basically had a fit on one of the people who prepared her meal. How rude can you be?", "It's funny, the size of my family is quite large on my mom's side, so the kids table was 100% a needed thing. We are now all in late 20s-late 30s, and still all group together and can it the 'kids table'. Which was just all of us sitting on the floor in a circle this year lmfao", "My cousins and siblings and I still sit at the \"kids\" table. The kids table now includes a couple of spouses, and we would have it no other way!", "Even when I entered my 20s, I preferred sitting with my younger cousins. We are super close and have great conversations. These days we don't have parties big enough to need multiple tables, usually. So we all sit together at one table.", "My 30 brother would go back to the kids table in a second if we would bring it back... because the kids table didn't use the nice china and he hates eating off delicate plates.", "We grew up with all adults and kids at the same table for most events like Christmas etc - all the cousins and aunts and uncles and us - and there was never an expectation that we kids were to be quiet.\n\nThen again we didn't do a formal style christmas dinner (must have turkey! Napkins! Fine China! Stem glassware!) - which actually is fine if that is what you want, but might come with extra etiquette requirements.", "I had a lot of cousins my age--we loves the kids table and kept doing it even when we were all in college or graduated!", "Yeesh, 21?! 21 year olds, who can legally drink, sit with the 2 year olds?!", "My brother and I still do this, we're almost 40. We tried to teach his kids to do it when they were younger, and they never cared much.", "If you look at my next comment, I acknowledge people have different experiences. I also said I was an only child so spending dinner with adults only was very common for me.", "Yup. Until someone dies or gets divorced there\u2019s no space in the other room. And it\u2019s too cold to eat outside", "IKR?!  My kid hates olives, I\u2019m like WTF were you switched at birth?"]}
