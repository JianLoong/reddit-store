He still didn't do that now, instead posting that picture  with that caption.   That was intentionally hurtful, and I'm not buying his saying anything otherwise.\n\nYour father being gay didn't make him a bad person.\n\nYour father having an affair made your father a bad person.   \n\nYour father inviting your siblings and not even extending an olive branch made your father a bad person.\n\nYour father posting a photo with him, his AP, their child, and your siblings with the caption he wrote made your father a bad person.\n\nYou don't need toxic people in your life, why add him back?", "YOU hurt HIM first?! You forgot to mention that your dad is amazing at gymnastics in your post. Olympic level.\n\nNTA x 10", "NTA.\n\nYou were an asshole for what you said years ago but you were also a child dealing with the emotional turmoil of a divorce. Holding that over your head for years is the real asshole thing here. Your father could've invited you years ago but didn't because he didn't want to deal with it. You're one of his children too and he's neglected you all this time. \n\nIt's entirely up to you whether you continue NC. Honestly though, I suggest giving him a piece of your mind before you decide though. Tell him how he's really hurt you all these years and let him stew in it. If you get no sympathy/empathy from this man then you're better off without him.", "NTA. 1) regardless of his sexuality, he cheated on your mother and destroyed your family, 2) he taught you to be homophobic, 3) you were 15 when you \u201churt him first.\u201d He was the adult. 4) any parent who would abandon a child because of words is the worst kind of human being and deserves to die with deep regret.", "NTA. That was an incredibly hurtful thing that he did. I would be very hesitant to remotely accept this from him myself. But, hey, free ticket to Europe for you both. Might be worth it just for the chance to travel.  Sounds like you had a really messed up life as a teen because of him, glad you didn't pull the whole \"marry and be phobic\" crap he did.", "Honestly your father as the adult shouldn't have thrown shade like that deliberately to hurt you.  You said the things you did as a child who grew up with a parent instilling those things. He should have given you some time and tried again. You are justified in feeling hurt. And the only reason he reached out was because you have a bf. Not because he missed you so much he wanted to try again and again until you either agreed to try for a new relationship or cut him off completely.  I would have said aren't you proud of the homophob you raised? But I'm petty so. I don't think you were wrong to lash back. But I also believe the hurt is to deep and anger on both sides run to strong at this point. If you want to reconnect with him you will have to make that first move and first apology.", "NTA. Like you said, you were the child and he had raised you to be homophobic\u2026 as hurtful as your words were, how could expect anything different?\n\nHis recent post, years after the incident was just as hurtful and exclusionary and he\u2019s old enough to know better.", "You father needs to take accountability for his mistakes. Yes some might say you were wrong insulting him but those insults were born from his mistakes,mistakes he has yet to fully admit to or take accountability for. Children are impressionable,you said those things because of the influences and teachings you grew up with which was your father's homophobia because his own suppressed sexuality.", "NTA- you were a child. Your dad instilled in you homophobic beliefs. Than became a hypocrite by being gay. Nothing wrong with that but with the way he raised you and his own beliefs is massively hypocritical. NTA OP", "NTA\n\nWas what you said hurtful and bigoted? Yes, and a very AH move. However, that's easily forgivable as:\n\n1. Your father intentionally raised you that way and you didn't know any better; and finally\n2. You were a child who just found out your father was not only cheating on your mother with another man, but he was leaving her for him\n3. You're showing genuine remorse for your actions\n\nYour father used his homophobia to cover up his sexual desires. From what you've said, ***he intentionally taught you to be homophobic!*** I'm also guessing he probably encouraged your homophobia as well. So to me, it's amazing how hurt he got after he raised you to be exactly how you acted all your life.\n\nThat post about how his \"family is complete, no missing piece\" was an AH move by your dad, who has never once tried to reach out to you after he left you, your mom and your siblings to be with this man. He never tried to see if you were still a raging homophobic like **he raised you to be**, or if your views had changed. He didn't do any of that, until he found out you have a boyfriend. So at the time of him posting that, he didn't consider you family, he considered you a stranger.\n\nAnd sorry if this offends you, but your grandma is coming off as an AH, as she's essentially blaming you for something your ***father taught you to be!*** Yes, you should take responsibility for your actions, but ***he*** also needs to take some ***responsibility*** for turning you into a homophobic little AH. Not to mention he also hurt you by cheating and leaving your mother after you learned he was everything ***he taught you to hate***. He's not the one who needs to feel \"safe\", it's you. Because this honestly reeks of him washing his hands of his actions and fully blaming you for what he raised you to be.\n\nSo I don't think your the AH for telling your dad to spend his money on his real family, as up until he decided to reconcile (only after learning you had a boyfriend), he never considered you family.\n\nNow, am I against you reconciling with your father? No, I think you should. But I also don't think you should leave the country and visit him this year. Talk to him on the phone, you need to explain how much he hurt you over the years; how he raised you to be a hateful bigot; how you felt not only betrayed, but also abandoned by him when he divorced your mother; how you were hurt how he never once tried to reach out to you until now; how it really hurt what he posted last year... and anything else you need to get off your chest.\n\n You can also talk to your siblings (if you don't already) and find out about the man your father is now.\n\nDon't leave the country to visit him, even with your boyfriend, until you get to know him a bit more. Just because he's no longer a raging homophobic bigot doesn't mean he's not an AH.", "First of all I am so sorry that you have been dealing with this and the pain that it has caused for so long. \n\nThat being said, I may get downvoted but NTA.\n\nWhat your father should have realized is that while what you said years ago WAS hurtful...*You were just a child,* dealing with a lot of stuff thrown at you.  1) Your Dad cheated on your Mom 2) with a MAN(! shocking b/c he presented himself as very homophobic) 3) He is partly responsible for your reaction due to the fact he always spouted homophobic cr\\*p and he was your example - so it would be difficult for you to switch gears like that.  Again he is blaming a child - children AND adults say stuff in the heat of the moment and anger that we regret later.    But your Dad posting the picture, years later of himself and your siblings saying that this was his \"whole family, no piece missing\" was absolutely a dig on you and on purpose.   He is an adult - and he jabbed at you out of the blue, of course you were hurt.  He announced to the (fb) world that who was pictured there was his ONLY family.  That hurts. \n\nI don't blame you for your outburst during the most recent call - I mean he's been NC with you for years then calls and expects you to come on over after his post of last year? nah. \n\nI would suggest you send him an email explaining to him that while you DO regret and apologize for what you said to him years ago - he shouldn't have just given up on you as HE was the parent and you were a child.  For years he ignored you but still had contact with your siblings. Explain how you felt and what part he played in your response.  Tell him how you feel and how hurt you were about his post last year so him calling you this year to 'talk' seemed disingenuous and while you may not have handled it as well as you could have, he made the distinction of who your family really was and it seemed directed at you and deliberately hurtful so you are at a loss as to why he would want you in his life now. Is it because he has now found out you are bi that you are 'acceptable' or he thinks now you will understand why he did what he did?  \n\nI wish you luck and peace.  I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that you may be able to have some sort of relationship - but there is a long road and hurt and resentment to get through first.  Take care.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get the dad you deserve", "NTA. You were a child when you said those things. Also, he was unfaithful to your mother left your family. Of course you are angry. \n\nRemember, parents aren\u2019t perfect.", "NTA. \n\nBut I have to ask you, what do you want more? Do you want to be 'right' and justified in your anger and have no relationship with your father? Or would you like to build a relationship with him and move forward and reach a point where you can forgive him and be happy? \n\nSometimes it doesn't matter who the arsehole is, or who started what, or who should have done things differently. \n\n\nIf you would like to move past this hurt and anger, then I would suggest you write him an email. Lay out everything you have said here. Tell him how you feel about everything. Tell him the regrets you have in your own actions. Tell him about the hurt and anger you felt from his actions. Tell him about the resentment you harbour because he was the adult, and failing to recognize that you were just a child. And tell him that you would like to be able to move forward from this and actually have some kind of relationship with him. Don't leave out anything.\n\nAnd then give him a little time to process it all and see what happens. \n\nWrite him, rather then call him, so that you can put everything in it, without being distracted by side issues and emotions that may get poked in an actual conversation. \n\nI hope for your sake that you can find peace out of this.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said when your dad revealed that his AP was a man. Your dad had a right to be hurt over that, even if you were just a teenager dealing with the aftermath of a divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, your dad\u2019s remark about his family being \u201ccomplete, no missing piece\u201d was cruel and definitely seemed pointed at you. \n\nI actually don\u2019t see a problem with the \u201cspend your money on your real family\u201d comment you made. But, maybe your dad is really attempting to come to terms with how he hurt you. \n\nI\u2019d say go reconcile with him when YOU feel ready, and let him know that you aren\u2019t ready to do that just yet.", "You both made missteps.

Try from both perspectives. Where did your dad get his previous homophobic attitude?", "Considering the age I'll say NTA for the current situation. He is blaming 15 year old you for the past. He has gone out if his way to make it clear you were excluded from his family. \n\nHe decided to stop parenting you at a difficult time.

If he invites you and you don't want to go, that's totally OK.

You should have allowed your recognition of that  to temper your response, regardless of what way you chose.

You may need more counseling to process your past trauma in a meaningful way.", "He did try to reach out. You either want to make it up with him or you don\u2019t. If you do, the past must be the past", "For grown men who both seemingly have regrets, you\u2019re both seemingly acting pretty defensive and petty still. Your father\u2019s actions now seem to be based solely on the fact that he only wants to reconnect now since you have a boyfriend. Maybe he feels you\u2019d understand him better now, maybe he\u2019s doing it to try to rub it in your face how wrong you\u2019d been as a teenager. But regardless you won\u2019t know unless you talk to him. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for an adult now to behave the way he is, but\u2026 emotions are rarely rational. As a result of that we often behave inappropriately as our emotions get the better of us.  He wasn\u2019t entirely wrong to point out that you said those things first. You did. He\u2019s pointing out the fact. But for a man wanting to reconcile, throwing up the past isn\u2019t the way to make things better.  But, would he have had a reason to do that and call you an AH if you hadn\u2019t thrown shade at him first with \u201cthe give it to your real family\u201d digs?  You came off nasty first when he extended the olive branch to you first. \n\nI think you should honestly start with a FaceTime or zoom or Skype call first and talk one on one alone. Calmly. And with an open mind. Hear him out and at least try to give him a little bit of courtesy. You\u2019ll get answers and resolution from it. And who knows maybe you two will forgive each other, but only if you\u2019re willing to give a little forgiveness and compassion in return.

Not to justify comments that you made, but children learn many thinking patterns, and opinions based on modeling their parents behaviors.  You mentioned that your father was extremely homophobic, when he came out, naturally, you were very upset, and confused, as all this time, he was preaching that being gay is wrong. I think he knows he fucked up by cheating, however, rather than owning up to this, you have somehow become the emotional punching bag, which is bullshit. It is up to you to proceed if you wanna have a relationship or go and NC.  However, based on his comments of \u201c well you hurt me first!\u201d, it sounds likely that this will perpetuate a very toxic relationship between you guys. I mean, he really guilted, and said that you hurt him first?!  Tough shit! Unfortunately, being a parent, unfortunately, sometimes your kids say hurtful things to you, however, often as parents we suck it up and keep moving.  However, the fact that he cheated, then was upset because of your reaction, then continued for years with his petty actions  and still plays the blame game with you, speaks volumes as to the potential future of the relationship between you guys.

Last I checked he wasn't the one who moved across the world and never gave an open door for possible reconciliation. He only decided that he should talk to him because he is now dating a guy so he though the only hurdle of homophobia was passed. But the father had no foresight to see that is wasn't the fact that he was gay that was causing problems, the son just wanted to hurt him so he said the only things he knew that would hurt him. The father still doesn't understand the irreparable damage he did to his family and the unforgiving consequences of his shitty behavior as a husband and a father.", "He made the first move 7 YEARS after what happened, with consistent light jabs (unbeknownst to him or not) over the years. You can't just walk out on someones life on such a poor note and expect it to be all fine and dandy nearly a decade later. Even with the best therapy, this wasn't going to go well. The dad is selfish, through and through, he was when he cheated on his wife, he was when he moved across the world, and he is now, walking into OP's life when it suits him. It would be best for OP to stop looking over the pond as it only leads to hurt, and anything to do with his father would be only to serve his wants and desires, not OP's wellbeing.", "There is no right or right answer here by the way. You need to decide which is best for you. Sometimes the hurt and anger is simply too much and the best decision is to cut them out of your life forever. \n\nBut if you do want him in your life, then it is going to be a lot of hard work from both of you to learn toforgive and move forward. \n\nI reccommend writing the email to him regardless of whether you want him in your life or not. It will give you an oppertunity to express yourself properly and ensure he actually has the opportunity to hear what you have to say, in full. \nWhat happens after that is up to you. Maybe he responds well to it and you can find a path to move forward. Or maybe he responds badly and you do make that final decision that he simply isn't worth it. But either way, it is progress for yourself.", "I don't think I would be so conflicted personally, but of course you gotta take our opinions with a grain of salt. He waited SEVEN YEARS to extend an invite. Why? Well its because he wants you there! Not because he thought YOU wanted to be there. He called and just assumed that you would jump with glee at the oh so generous offer. He should have been inviting you day one, that would have let you know he was willing to work past this, instead, he pretended that you didn't exist, and I don't think that's something I could work past. He doesn't care about your wellbeing, not now, not then. He only cares to serve his own selfish interest.", "From personal perspective, forgiveness CAN be a very good thing because generally holding grudges at best makes both parties miserable.\n\nThat said, this has to be \"for you\" , not him. He very much hurt you first, it's on him to try and make amends for that, on you if you take him up on it. \n\nIf you personally feel that it could help you heal, could be a good thing going forward, than for your own sake try to let go of the past and see it as a chance for yourself. if on the flipside however you feel that all you'll gain is a chance of even more hurt, or are simply at a point where you feel contempt in life and don't think it will be an active gain for yourself than cut your ties and live your best life. \n\nForgiveness foremost should be for the one giving it. the one receiving it is free to feel good if they receive it, but they have no claim to it. it's their own problem if they never receive it, not yours, as you are the wronged party.", "Honestly I have to disagree. It's not about right or wrong. Your father really messed you up. He raised you to be homophobic and also cheated on your mother. I can't comprehend the mental gymnastics he's doing to think any of that is okay. I mean seriously. Not even a proper apology? I can't imagine what it must've been like during the aftermath, the therapy and everything. And discovering your own sexuality on top of that. He doesn't get to waltz in and suddenly want a relationship when he made it clear last year with that post.

Imho don\u2019t let your anger ruin this, find calm ways to express your feelings and let him know it\u2019s 7 years worth and it will take time to adapt your tone to who he is now.\n\nAll the best, I can only imagine how confusing and hard that must be for a young boy at a time in life where you\u2019re growing into yourself and identity and really need that dependable role model.", "You would be the AH if you refuse an honest attempt at reconciliation.

You can of course tell him how much he has hurt you, but you\u2019re going to have to find a way to move forward from that hurt if you want to foster a relationship with him. He probably was very hurt when you were homophobic to him as a kid, and he probably was scared to contact you for a long time because he knew he had raised you to be homophobic. Does that give him the right to treat you the way he has?  No of course not. Seems like there\u2019s a lot of pain in this relationship but he wants to try and make things better.

It meant enough to him that he offered to let your bf come with you when you do so. If you burn this bridge you will need to come to terms with the fact that likely you will have to face more of this exclusion with no chance of communicating your hurt. Is that what you want? If so, entirely understandable and good luck. If not\u2026 you may want to consider that he\u2019s trying to meet you halfway.", "Unbiased view as best I can give is  \nFirstly NTA  \n\n\nAs has been said many times you were a child who was raised with warped hateful views which is extra confusing when you are bisexual yourself (I know that feeling personally as well). You were processing your father being both a cheater and someone he had taught you to hate. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT YOU REACTED AS SUCH  \n\n\nThat said I also understand the guilt that comes with discovering your sexuality and contextualizing it with former harmful beliefs (in your case it must feel awful having said that to your father even though he was a cheater). Even though he should obviously know better since he himself instilled those beliefs (I'm curious if your mother shared those beliefs or ever tried to teach you differently) and did wrong it still probably hurt to hear your own son call you a f\\*g and say you're dead to him. In his mind you may have wanted nothing to do with him anymore and considered that relationship dead, perhaps thinking he was doing you a kindness leaving you alone. But finding out that you had a bf maybe gave him hope that you had changed and there was still something there.   \n\n\nBuuuut he went about it wrong. He didn't think through the implications of how you may have changed, didn't apologize for how his actions/absence affected you, hadn't considered how his not including you would have affected you if you did want to reconnect,  and worst of all had the AUDACITY to fault you for any of this when his actions were entirely to blame. And him not acknowledging these things is a major problem. him undermining the effect they had on you is a major problem. And him wanting to extend an olive branch without humility given what he did to you is a MAJOR problem.   \n\n\nHaving said all that, the move is up to you on whether or not you want to reconnect with him. I may be downvoted to oblivion for saying this but if it's going to happen you need to consider his perspective as well. He probably lived his entire adult life in the closet, and came out in the most harmful way possible. But to him that was also 7 years ago, 7 years in which he has begun to build a new life. Who you look at as his affair partner he just sees as his partner, and he probably doesn't want tension between you both. (not sure if that person knows the full situation though) And as I said before for those 7 years he may have been convinced he raised a bigot who hated him and wanted nothing to do with him anymore. (I'm not sure if that f\\*g comment was the only one or if there were others) You know you've changed and how you've changed but he doesn't.   \n\n\nNow, you could say none of that matters because at the end of the day he did wrong and you shouldn't be compelled to feel sympathy for him. Which is true and in such a case is probably best if you cut ties for good. But as much as it hurts if you do want to reconnect you need to reign in your anger and hurt so you can communicate your feelings clearly and entirely. Neither of you are at a place where you venting your frustrations to him will help. And just as you need to know that you will be heard and have your hurt acknowledged he needs to know there is a possibility you can forgive him if this is going to work. I know you're hurting, hurting a lot, and I know the feeling of being between wanting to just let out all your anger towards him but also destroyed because you really wish things had been different. It's confusing and painful.   \n\n\nOnly you get to decide if you're willing to let him back into your life, and NO ONE would fault you if you didn't. His sexuality didn't excuse his cheating and he was well old enough not to instill hateful values into you because of his own repressed guilt then leave you on your own to undo that damage....but...if you want an objective take then put simply you can't reconnect if he doesn't believe there's a chance you'll forgive him and things can get better. As others have recommended maybe write a letter that you go over a few times till you're sure it clearly conveys what you feel, what you've been through, and what you want. Whether that's to tell him what he needs to do if he wants you in his life or to tell him to fuck off, that is on you.   \n\n\nBest of luck and I'm happy despite your rough upbringing you seem in a better place in life if a bit rocky now.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m saying OP wasn\u2019t TA for saying that.

No. Could he have obtained a divorce, sucked up the fallout, and retained a relationship with all of his children? Absolutely. \n\nDad seems to be a narcissistic ahole.

And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s caused many conflicting emotions and feelings of resentment for your own sexuality at times.\n\nNot only did he break apart his family, he did it by cheating and revealing that he\u2019s a hypocrite. I know sexuality is complex and nuanced, but to teach your kids to be homophobic to mask your sexuality is really messed up.\n\nAs for what you said, you were lashing out as a child. You were angry. I don\u2019t expect children to perfectly regulate their emotions and practice emotional maturity to the extent of an adult. I\u2019m sure you learned your lesson and are able to take a step back now and know not to say hurtful things when you\u2019re feeling hurt. But at the time, who can blame you? Like I said you were a kid whose life was falling apart at the time.\n\nI do understand your dad\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s hard coming out. Maybe he was raised in a homophobic household too and had to do a lot of unpacking there as well. But to hold those words against a child, and punish them for it for 7 years? That\u2019s a pretty horrifying thing to do. What you said was hurtful, but he should have the emotional maturity to recognize where those words were coming from at the time, and that he was responsible for those hurt feelings.\n\nIt seems to me he only reached out because he found out you had a boyfriend, and he probably had an epiphany that he caused you a lot of harm by being homophobic and that was part of the reason why you were so resentful. But he should have been trying to repair that relationship much earlier than this. I\u2019m gay myself and would have also been hurt by what you said, but I also would have recognized that your reaction was a product of the environment you were raised in, which is 100% all on him.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely still hurt and lashing out, but it also seems like you want a relationship with your dad. My best advice, don\u2019t let hurt feelings get in the way of what you want. You seem genuinely remorseful with what you said to your dad all those years ago. Maybe start a conversation with that, explain why you said what you said, that you\u2019re deeply regretful, but at the time that\u2019s all you knew because of what he taught you. And that now you\u2019re growing and learning and realize that it was an awful thing to say and that you\u2019ve wanted to mend things between you two but that you never thought that was an option because of how he\u2019s excluded you. I would explain to him that you still have some resentment over being excluded for what you said as a child, and give him the opportunity to explain his side of things. Maybe he regrets his actions just as much as you do. Give him the opportunity to fix it. It\u2019s gonna be difficult at first but you do deserve some form of closure with how everything went down and I hope that closure allows you to move forward and have very happy and fulfilling relationships throughout the rest of your life, even if you decide one of those relationships shouldn\u2019t be with your father.

Write it all down in a letter as you have put some here. The hurtful things you said as a child were as a child, raised that way by him, he installed that in you and after he left you grew up differently now.\n\nYou recognize the hurt of those words and a larger understanding now especially in your own relationship with your partner. Lay out your feelings on what you said as a child but with the perspective you have now and explain to him that you no longer feel that way, why you did and that he must also accept some blame there. \n\nLay out that as an adult, no longer geeling the way you did as a child and with greater appreciation, the actions he has taken these years with your siblings has hurt you deeply. That as a child it wasn't your responsibility to try open communications again, as an adult/parent it was his responsibility. He did that with your siblings which further hurt you. \n\nThey received preferential treatment for essentially not being influenced by him in his homophobia and how he raised you(granted you were older and thus closer to him than the younger siblings who would have had less of a voice about issues/divorce). \n\nThe only area you could be considered a bit of an AH here is in your reaction to his attempt to reconcile. You can advocate for yourself without going on the attack. You did voice your hurt and let him know you'd seen these posts, but it put him on the defensive and created further distance. But reconciliation is not something that has to happen. \n\nI feel you were blindsided a bit with his request and his attempt to reconcile should have come with a real conversation rather than an invite first.

In person may be too much for a start, phone calls can get heated quickly if people are on edge..email and letters offer a safer more considered way to communicate as there is a separation there, its not direct or immediate, you have time to process and respond in your own time. \n\nThats only if you want to do three things. \n\n1) let him know the damage he's done and let him think on how he feels about that, or what work he'd need to do himself. At least it gives opportunity for him to see things from your view now, not as the past child you were and apologize upon reflection. \n\n2) if you did want to reconcile, it means you're laying it out, cards on the table, coz if you dont and you simply start talking like nothing happened one day, guaranteed there would be some undercurrent of unresolved feelings that would surface. \n\n3) Either way, you're still carrying a lot of hurt that comes through in your post and it may help you deal with it.

By the way, you didn't hurt him first, he hurt you first by teaching you a bunch of homophobic garbage rather than to treat people with decency, then hurt you again when he broke up the family by selfishly having an affair.

In terms of your argument with your father, both of you have said some things that weren't nice toward each other. I understand that you feel like your father turned on you.
