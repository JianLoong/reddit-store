He still didn't do that now, instead posting that picture  with that caption.   That was intentionally hurtful, and I'm not buying his saying anything otherwise.\n\nYour father being gay didn't make him a bad person.\n\nYour father having an affair made your father a bad person.   \n\nYour father inviting your siblings and not even extending an olive branch made your father a bad person.\n\nYour father posting a photo with him, his AP, their child, and your siblings with the caption he wrote made your father a bad person.\n\nYou don't need toxic people in your life, why add him back?", "YOU hurt HIM first?! You forgot to mention that your dad is amazing at gymnastics in your post. Olympic level.\n\nNTA x 10", "NTA.\n\nYou were an asshole for what you said years ago but you were also a child dealing with the emotional turmoil of a divorce. Holding that over your head for years is the real asshole thing here. Your father could've invited you years ago but didn't because he didn't want to deal with it. You're one of his children too and he's neglected you all this time. \n\nIt's entirely up to you whether you continue NC. Honestly though, I suggest giving him a piece of your mind before you decide though. Tell him how he's really hurt you all these years and let him stew in it. If you get no sympathy/empathy from this man then you're better off without him.", "NTA. 1) regardless of his sexuality, he cheated on your mother and destroyed your family, 2) he taught you to be homophobic, 3) you were 15 when you \u201churt him first.\u201d He was the adult. 4) any parent who would abandon a child because of words is the worst kind of human being and deserves to die with deep regret.", "NTA. That was an incredibly hurtful thing that he did. I would be very hesitant to remotely accept this from him myself. But, hey, free ticket to Europe for you both. Might be worth it just for the chance to travel.  Sounds like you had a really messed up life as a teen because of him, glad you didn't pull the whole \"marry and be phobic\" crap he did.", "Honestly your father as the adult shouldn't have thrown shade like that deliberately to hurt you.  You said the things you did as a child who grew up with a parent instilling those things. He should have given you some time and tried again. You are justified in feeling hurt. And the only reason he reached out was because you have a bf. Not because he missed you so much he wanted to try again and again until you either agreed to try for a new relationship or cut him off completely.  I would have said aren't you proud of the homophob you raised? But I'm petty so. I don't think you were wrong to lash back. But I also believe the hurt is to deep and anger on both sides run to strong at this point. If you want to reconnect with him you will have to make that first move and first apology.", "NTA. Like you said, you were the child and he had raised you to be homophobic\u2026 as hurtful as your words were, how could expect anything different?\n\nHis recent post, years after the incident was just as hurtful and exclusionary and he\u2019s old enough to know better.", "You father needs to take accountability for his mistakes. Yes some might say you were wrong insulting him but those insults were born from his mistakes,mistakes he has yet to fully admit to or take accountability for. Children are impressionable,you said those things because of the influences and teachings you grew up with which was your father's homophobia because his own suppressed sexuality.", "NTA- you were a child. Your dad instilled in you homophobic beliefs. Than became a hypocrite by being gay. Nothing wrong with that but with the way he raised you and his own beliefs is massively hypocritical. NTA OP", "NTA\n\nWas what you said hurtful and bigoted? Yes, and a very AH move. However, that's easily forgivable as:\n\n1. Your father intentionally raised you that way and you didn't know any better; and finally\n2. You were a child who just found out your father was not only cheating on your mother with another man, but he was leaving her for him\n3. You're showing genuine remorse for your actions\n\nYour father used his homophobia to cover up his sexual desires. From what you've said, ***he intentionally taught you to be homophobic!*** I'm also guessing he probably encouraged your homophobia as well. So to me, it's amazing how hurt he got after he raised you to be exactly how you acted all your life.\n\nThat post about how his \"family is complete, no missing piece\" was an AH move by your dad, who has never once tried to reach out to you after he left you, your mom and your siblings to be with this man. He never tried to see if you were still a raging homophobic like **he raised you to be**, or if your views had changed. He didn't do any of that, until he found out you have a boyfriend. So at the time of him posting that, he didn't consider you family, he considered you a stranger.\n\nAnd sorry if this offends you, but your grandma is coming off as an AH, as she's essentially blaming you for something your ***father taught you to be!*** Yes, you should take responsibility for your actions, but ***he*** also needs to take some ***responsibility*** for turning you into a homophobic little AH. Not to mention he also hurt you by cheating and leaving your mother after you learned he was everything ***he taught you to hate***. He's not the one who needs to feel \"safe\", it's you. Because this honestly reeks of him washing his hands of his actions and fully blaming you for what he raised you to be.\n\nSo I don't think your the AH for telling your dad to spend his money on his real family, as up until he decided to reconcile (only after learning you had a boyfriend), he never considered you family.\n\nNow, am I against you reconciling with your father? No, I think you should. But I also don't think you should leave the country and visit him this year. Talk to him on the phone, you need to explain how much he hurt you over the years; how he raised you to be a hateful bigot; how you felt not only betrayed, but also abandoned by him when he divorced your mother; how you were hurt how he never once tried to reach out to you until now; how it really hurt what he posted last year... and anything else you need to get off your chest.\n\n You can also talk to your siblings (if you don't already) and find out about the man your father is now.\n\nDon't leave the country to visit him, even with your boyfriend, until you get to know him a bit more. Just because he's no longer a raging homophobic bigot doesn't mean he's not an AH.", "First of all I am so sorry that you have been dealing with this and the pain that it has caused for so long. \n\nThat being said, I may get downvoted but NTA.\n\nWhat your father should have realized is that while what you said years ago WAS hurtful...*You were just a child,* dealing with a lot of stuff thrown at you.  1) Your Dad cheated on your Mom 2) with a MAN(! shocking b/c he presented himself as very homophobic) 3) He is partly responsible for your reaction due to the fact he always spouted homophobic cr\\*p and he was your example - so it would be difficult for you to switch gears like that.  Again he is blaming a child - children AND adults say stuff in the heat of the moment and anger that we regret later.    But your Dad posting the picture, years later of himself and your siblings saying that this was his \"whole family, no piece missing\" was absolutely a dig on you and on purpose.   He is an adult - and he jabbed at you out of the blue, of course you were hurt.  He announced to the (fb) world that who was pictured there was his ONLY family.  That hurts. \n\nI don't blame you for your outburst during the most recent call - I mean he's been NC with you for years then calls and expects you to come on over after his post of last year? nah. \n\nI would suggest you send him an email explaining to him that while you DO regret and apologize for what you said to him years ago - he shouldn't have just given up on you as HE was the parent and you were a child.  For years he ignored you but still had contact with your siblings. Explain how you felt and what part he played in your response.  Tell him how you feel and how hurt you were about his post last year so him calling you this year to 'talk' seemed disingenuous and while you may not have handled it as well as you could have, he made the distinction of who your family really was and it seemed directed at you and deliberately hurtful so you are at a loss as to why he would want you in his life now. Is it because he has now found out you are bi that you are 'acceptable' or he thinks now you will understand why he did what he did?  \n\nI wish you luck and peace.  I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that you may be able to have some sort of relationship - but there is a long road and hurt and resentment to get through first.  Take care.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get the dad you deserve", "NTA. You were a child when you said those things. Also, he was unfaithful to your mother left your family. Of course you are angry. \n\nRemember, parents aren\u2019t perfect.", "NTA. \n\nBut I have to ask you, what do you want more? Do you want to be 'right' and justified in your anger and have no relationship with your father? Or would you like to build a relationship with him and move forward and reach a point where you can forgive him and be happy? \n\nSometimes it doesn't matter who the arsehole is, or who started what, or who should have done things differently. \n\n\nIf you would like to move past this hurt and anger, then I would suggest you write him an email. Lay out everything you have said here. Tell him how you feel about everything. Tell him the regrets you have in your own actions. Tell him about the hurt and anger you felt from his actions. Tell him about the resentment you harbour because he was the adult, and failing to recognize that you were just a child. And tell him that you would like to be able to move forward from this and actually have some kind of relationship with him. Don't leave out anything.\n\nAnd then give him a little time to process it all and see what happens. \n\nWrite him, rather then call him, so that you can put everything in it, without being distracted by side issues and emotions that may get poked in an actual conversation. \n\nI hope for your sake that you can find peace out of this.", "ESH. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said when your dad revealed that his AP was a man. Your dad had a right to be hurt over that, even if you were just a teenager dealing with the aftermath of a divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, your dad\u2019s remark about his family being \u201ccomplete, no missing piece\u201d was cruel and definitely seemed pointed at you. \n\nI actually don\u2019t see a problem with the \u201cspend your money on your real family\u201d comment you made. But, maybe your dad is really attempting to come to terms with how he hurt you. \n\nI\u2019d say go reconcile with him when YOU feel ready, and let him know that you aren\u2019t ready to do that just yet.", "You both made missteps.

I think your dad may have missed that what you said likely came out from his buried in the closet behavior. Take some time to cool off, maybe a nice walk/hike in the woods. Think things through. Try from both perspectives. Where did your dad get his previous homophobic attitude?", "Considering the age I'll say NTA for the current situation. He is blaming 15 year old you for the past. He has gone out if his way to make it clear you were excluded from his family. \n\nHe decided to stop parenting you at a difficult time. He does not get to demand a relationship with you on his terms.", "This is a really tough one, but I'm going to go with NTA since you were young and acting from a place of hurt. But since he is extending an olive branch and it sounds like you have some remorse for what you said, I would recommend just being honest with him instead of trying to hurt him now. If he invites you and you don't want to go, that's totally OK. But maybe try saying something like \"the way you broke our family and the words you said about your new family hurt me, and I can't forgive you yet\" or something like that. I think this will also help you feel better about yourself.", "Posts like this make me sick. Ofc NTA. \u201cHurt him first\u201d.

That was neither of your faults. You both discovered who you were afterwards in your own space and time but hurtful things were said nonetheless. You severed that relationship and he respected your decision. He wants to reconcile but you're still not in a well enough place to do that. I hope at some point you seek some healthy support so you can work all of this out. You both regret how things played out over the years, hopefully you both come to a point in time where there is the opportunity for a positive relationship.", "YTA.\n\nListen, I get that navigating situations like this is hard.  Yes, at the time you were a child and spewed back the homophobia he taught you. But you know better now. \n\nAnd yet you still chose petty. You still chose lashing out. You still want to punish him. \n\nHe made the first move. He wants to reconcile.  This was a good and positive move on his part.  You should have allowed your recognition of that  to temper your response, regardless of what way you chose. If you could not have even done that, you should have deferred the discussion, saying that you\u2019re not ready for it. You may need more counseling to process your past trauma in a meaningful way.", "He did try to reach out. You either want to make it up with him or you don\u2019t. If you do, the past must be the past", "For grown men who both seemingly have regrets, you\u2019re both seemingly acting pretty defensive and petty still. Your father\u2019s actions now seem to be based solely on the fact that he only wants to reconnect now since you have a boyfriend. Maybe he feels you\u2019d understand him better now, maybe he\u2019s doing it to try to rub it in your face how wrong you\u2019d been as a teenager. But regardless you won\u2019t know unless you talk to him. \n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for an adult now to behave the way he is, but\u2026 emotions are rarely rational. As a result of that we often behave inappropriately as our emotions get the better of us.  He wasn\u2019t entirely wrong to point out that you said those things first. You did. He\u2019s pointing out the fact. But for a man wanting to reconcile, throwing up the past isn\u2019t the way to make things better.  But, would he have had a reason to do that and call you an AH if you hadn\u2019t thrown shade at him first with \u201cthe give it to your real family\u201d digs?  You came off nasty first when he extended the olive branch to you first. \n\nI think you should honestly start with a FaceTime or zoom or Skype call first and talk one on one alone. Calmly. And with an open mind. Hear him out and at least try to give him a little bit of courtesy. You\u2019ll get answers and resolution from it. And who knows maybe you two will forgive each other, but only if you\u2019re willing to give a little forgiveness and compassion in return.  One things for certain, holding on to the hurt and anger of the past won\u2019t fix it, won\u2019t change it, and won\u2019t make any difference.

Not to justify comments that you made, but children learn many thinking patterns, and opinions based on modeling their parents behaviors.  You mentioned that your father was extremely homophobic, when he came out, naturally, you were very upset, and confused, as all this time, he was preaching that being gay is wrong. I think he knows he fucked up by cheating, however, rather than owning up to this, you have somehow become the emotional punching bag, which is bullshit. It is up to you to proceed if you wanna have a relationship or go and NC.  However, based on his comments of \u201c well you hurt me first!\u201d, it sounds likely that this will perpetuate a very toxic relationship between you guys. I mean, he really guilted, and said that you hurt him first?!  Tough shit! Unfortunately, being a parent, unfortunately, sometimes your kids say hurtful things to you, however, often as parents we suck it up and keep moving.  However, the fact that he cheated, then was upset because of your reaction, then continued for years with his petty actions  and still plays the blame game with you, speaks volumes as to the potential future of the relationship between you guys. He is already starting on the wrong foot!

Last I checked he wasn't the one who moved across the world and never gave an open door for possible reconciliation. He only decided that he should talk to him because he is now dating a guy so he though the only hurdle of homophobia was passed. But the father had no foresight to see that is wasn't the fact that he was gay that was causing problems, the son just wanted to hurt him so he said the only things he knew that would hurt him. The father still doesn't understand the irreparable damage he did to his family and the unforgiving consequences of his shitty behavior as a husband and a father.", "He made the first move 7 YEARS after what happened, with consistent light jabs (unbeknownst to him or not) over the years. You can't just walk out on someones life on such a poor note and expect it to be all fine and dandy nearly a decade later. Even with the best therapy, this wasn't going to go well. The dad is selfish, through and through, he was when he cheated on his wife, he was when he moved across the world, and he is now, walking into OP's life when it suits him. It would be best for OP to stop looking over the pond as it only leads to hurt, and anything to do with his father would be only to serve his wants and desires, not OP's wellbeing.", "There is no right or right answer here by the way. You need to decide which is best for you. Sometimes the hurt and anger is simply too much and the best decision is to cut them out of your life forever. \n\nBut if you do want him in your life, then it is going to be a lot of hard work from both of you to learn toforgive and move forward. \n\nI reccommend writing the email to him regardless of whether you want him in your life or not. It will give you an oppertunity to express yourself properly and ensure he actually has the opportunity to hear what you have to say, in full. \nWhat happens after that is up to you. Maybe he responds well to it and you can find a path to move forward. Or maybe he responds badly and you do make that final decision that he simply isn't worth it. But either way, it is progress for yourself.", "I don't think I would be so conflicted personally, but of course you gotta take our opinions with a grain of salt. He waited SEVEN YEARS to extend an invite. Why? Well its because he wants you there! Not because he thought YOU wanted to be there. He called and just assumed that you would jump with glee at the oh so generous offer. He should have been inviting you day one, that would have let you know he was willing to work past this, instead, he pretended that you didn't exist, and I don't think that's something I could work past. He doesn't care about your wellbeing, not now, not then. He only cares to serve his own selfish interest.", "From personal perspective, forgiveness CAN be a very good thing because generally holding grudges at best makes both parties miserable.\n\nThat said, this has to be \"for you\" , not him. He very much hurt you first, it's on him to try and make amends for that, on you if you take him up on it. \n\nIf you personally feel that it could help you heal, could be a good thing going forward, than for your own sake try to let go of the past and see it as a chance for yourself. if on the flipside however you feel that all you'll gain is a chance of even more hurt, or are simply at a point where you feel contempt in life and don't think it will be an active gain for yourself than cut your ties and live your best life. \n\nForgiveness foremost should be for the one giving it. the one receiving it is free to feel good if they receive it, but they have no claim to it. it's their own problem if they never receive it, not yours, as you are the wronged party.", "Honestly I have to disagree. It's not about right or wrong. Your father really messed you up. He raised you to be homophobic and also cheated on your mother. I can't comprehend the mental gymnastics he's doing to think any of that is okay. I mean seriously. Not even a proper apology? I can't imagine what it must've been like during the aftermath, the therapy and everything. And discovering your own sexuality on top of that. He doesn't get to waltz in and suddenly want a relationship when he made it clear last year with that post. The best thing to do is keep NC for your own mental health and get rid of him from social media and live your life. I'd suggest therapy to cope with this. You only miss the man he wanted you to see, a projection. He lied to you and your mother and your siblings for years, hiding his real self. I can't imagine your mother's pain, to be used as an incubator basically for his sperm.

He's acting like a baby, when he goes like, I'm hurt first, this isn't a competition and passive aggressively posting shit on Facebook isn't so mature either. Instead he should go into self reflection, where he went wrong in his education for things going down like this after he came out. You on the other hand could overcome your homophobia and can accept yourself which is not a given with this education. Anyone thinking he needs reassurance to be \"save\" with you but you can be save with him in a foreign country in his house with this vengeful petty man is wrong. I'm sorry but your father is crap, you're good, you probably should let go off this man", "One you were a kid. Yes a teen but a kid. So he was hurt He had the affair he doesn\u2019t get to have hurt feelings. That said You should work out your stuff face to face. You can salvage your relationship if he means what he says. But ask your mom for a round trip ticket just in case.", "NTA - But you are making a mistake you'll regret IMO. You want to be a part of your dad's life. Your both going to have to let go of all the pain  from the past if you want that to happen.", "ESH. You first are complaining about him not counting you as a child even though you did say very hurtful things to him, only to finally receive a chance to mend things just to blow it for being petty. Yes, the photo and the caption was a dick move but can you blame him? As far as i read you never tried to apologize for that if you really felt it.\n\nNow onto the father. What kind of flaccid asshole not only leaves his family behind but also leaves to another fucking country on the other side of the world, and not expected a full blown insult for his sons? As a father he is a disgrace for not man up his mistake and face it, for feeling \"hurt\" for his son to bash on him for his actions and for not mending the relationship himself. He is a grown ass adult, so he is not allowed the \"i was hurt first card\", especially againsy his son who was the real victim here.\n\nFuck this situation man, good luck and you dont need a man like him.", "NTA, you were a child that had homophobic ideas inserted into them by their parent. What you said as a child was something he as the grown up dealt with instead of pushing it on you! He is very clearly in the wrong and I'm sorry he is an AH for how he has handled the whole situation!!", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\nYour dad found out his identity can shield him from criticism for being a horrifying human being and is enjoying his newfound immunity while making life harder on every other queer person struggling.", "NTA\n\nHe hurt you first. He brainwashed you into being homophobic, then \"came out\" by cheating and abandoning you. You said hurtful things as a child, things you didn't mean, things he trained you to say, and he never gave you any understanding, empathy or kindness. Even now, years later, he can't admit his actions and abuse of you. Instead he's trying to pretend you were the instigator of the situation.\n\nHe's a selfish, narcissistic asshole who wants to pretend he's a victim when all he has done is abuse you. Burn that bridge. Live your best life.", "NTA. He taught you to be homophobic and then is surprise you hurl his bullshit back at him when you were hurting as a kid. Your dad is a selfish asshole. Being gay doesn't excuse him cheating on your mom and being a homophobic jerk all your lives.", "YTA He probably didn't contact you to give you time and because you didn't reach out either he probably thought, that he lost you completely. It's still not great what he wrote, but he earnestly tried to reconnect with you.", "NTA\n\nYour father was an Adult you were the child. You were in a very rough situation your father had put you in. Your father taught you to be homophobic.\n\nYour father does not get to blame you for your reaction to his actions.\n\nIt was your father's responsibility to come back to you after the situation was calmed down. He doesn't get to behave all hurt, because this situation is his fault. He was unkind and cruel.\n\nSorry this had happened to you. IT WAS Not YOUR FAULT!", "NTA - HOWEVER, I think you need to think about your end game here. It seems like you might be making decisions based on your hurt feelings, and this might not be the best approach (depending on what you want the outcome to be). But, first let me say that your feelings are completely valid and you are absolutely right\u2026you were a child, so it was on your father to be the grown up and try to help you through these life altering changes. Nevertheless, from your post, it sounds like you still might want a relationship with him. The only way you will get to that end is to talk to him. If this is the case, you might want to reconsider his offer and meet with him. Now, if you have decided that you no longer want a relationship with him, that\u2019s a different story. There\u2019s nothing else you need to do except live your life and be happy.", "NTA. Your father punished a literal child while he was breaking up your family with his cheating. HE is the one who taught you to be homophobic, so he has no one to blame but himself for your reaction. He then punished you for years by excluding you from his family while including your siblings. All bc HE made a bunch of mistakes and couldn\u2019t be the bigger person and own up to them. He should have been a father to you and tried to repair your relationship, and instead he punished you. The post about no missing piece was deliberately to hurt you. That\u2019s just cruel and petty and he deserves nothing from you.", "This is so sad. It seems that you\u2019re acceptable now because you\u2019re bi, what happens in a few years if you have an opposite gender partner. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Try to think about your relationship with him from a long term perspective and try not to let him bait you into saying or doing anything strictly in reaction to him, he sounds very immature.", "but OP hUrT hIm FiRsT.", "Your father teaching you to be homophobic because of his own internalised homophobia made him a bad person. Your father only reaching out to you when he knew you had a boyfriend made him a bad person. I'm sure there's more that OP could add.", ">any parent who would abandon a child because of words is the worst kind of human being and deserves to die with deep regret.\n\nAnd to add the insult, words that said parents taught him and uttered AFTER said parents hurt the child. \n\nHE can get lost and disappear. Also show his \"real\" him with the overall behavior, cheating, breaking the family, fleeing to europe, having a new child eventhough he already broke the life of his 3 existing biological children.", ">You were an asshole for what you said years ago but you were also a child dealing with the emotional turmoil of a divorce. \n\nHe was not an asshole, he was a teenager having hiw world turned inside out by one of the key structure of this world, and in the most contradictory and shattering manners. The only asshole here is his \"dad\". \n\nComing out is not a \"free jail card\" to bypass your responsabilities and sheltering you from consequences of your own action.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He crippled OP's social skills by immersing him in a homophobic environment and actively teaching him bigotry, and then he hurt the entire family by cheating on his wife. On any way you look at it, the first injury was dealt by him, not to him. He isn't the victim here.", "\n\nYou don't have to forgive your \"dad\".

Of course it's difficult to open up to him after all that.\n\nBut now comes an opportunity and he is trying sincerely to fix things between you.

Then for years didn't attempt to reach out and reconcile but simply excluded you, again, a child with views of his making, while embracing your siblings. Then as recently as a year ago, publicly posted about how his family is compete with no missing proceeds pieces, without you. Explain how that made you feel, how, I expect, coming to terms with your own sexuality was made more difficult because of his views in your early life.

OP could have had that too. He\u2019s the one who lashed out with a torrent of homophobia. He\u2019s the one who told his father \u201cYou\u2019re dead to me.\u201d He\u2019s the one who kicked his father out of his life.
