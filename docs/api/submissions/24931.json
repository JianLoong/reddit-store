I wouldn't have apologized myself because you're not wrong.", "Insanely soft YTA, you weren\u2019t setting out to be a dick, 9 times out of 10 you wouldn\u2019t have been an AH, you just happened to luck out.\n\nMaybe double check context before making jokes next time, just in case", "Somebody told OP:\n\n\"Here's a tattoo you should see!\"\n\nAnd OP took a look at the pic.\n\nIt was looking like a guy,\n\nSo nobody can say why\n\nOP asked \"is that Shrek\" like a dick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you're an asshole\n\nHow could you have not seen\n\nOP, are you blind lol?\n\nIt was not Shrek- he's green!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my vote- YTA!\n\nWriting this was fun I must say.", "NTA, honest mistake. Hilarious though.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve just asked who it was. The odds of someone having a reverent Shrek tattoo are pretty low compared to tattoos of dead loved ones. You tried to make a joke, and you hurt her feelings.", "You know black and white tattoos are a thing right?", "Yes, and you're still an asshole.", "Nobody is the AH\nFoot in mouth interactions happen and it was clearly a quip made out of context to the situation. It wasn't the nicest quip being it was about a permanent mark on someones body and was probably not in fact so shrek like that your question was sincere. It has a chance to be funny or a chance to land wrong. That's the risk of making quips like that. \n\nHowever, She didn't give you context and portrait tattoos can be bad. It could have been a picture she was showing for humourous reasons. She assumed you knew her intentions and was offended when your reaction wasn't what she expected. \n\nOnce you learned the context, you apologized for the joke in poor taste and it sounds like you were sincere. If she accepts the apology, id say move on. If she doesn't, she's TAH.", "YTA bruh come on you need more sense than this", "YTA, lightly.\n\nI think this is one of those \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person but you were an asshole in this situation.\u201d If you\u2019re not super sure the tattoo is of shrek, or at least some cartoon character, you probably shouldn\u2019t ask if it\u2019s shrek. \n\nBut you apologized, IMO your colleague should forgive you and everyone move on with their lives.", "NTA. It sounds like an honest mistake, not  as though you were trying to be malicious. People get tattoos of cartoon characters all the time. She just shoved a random picture of a tattoo in your face without any context, how were you supposed to know?", "once a friend of mine got a tattoo of the SF skyline on her arm and i told her i thought she had a really cool fraiser tattoo", "I knew a girl in college who was showing her new tattoo to the class. One guy walks over, having not heard her story for getting it. \n\"Whoa, is that Hitler?\"\nIt was Edgar Allan Poe... though after he said that, I couldn't unsee Hitler. She has since gotten it redone.", "That. Is hilarious", "NTA. It was a simple mistake, I'm sure she'll get ogre it", "YTA. Unless the portrait had green skin, I don't know if it's an \"honest mistake\" like some are insinuating. Seems more like you made an insensitive joke that didn't land.", "NTA if you honestly thought that picture looked like Shrek. Then your false guess is the result of a bad tattoo artist.", "YTA. When my sister announced her baby name, my first reaction was \u201cI know a car named that.\u201d She didn\u2019t appreciate it.

Add in factors like gaining or losing weight and the inevitable aging process and it will go wrong sooner than you think.", "They do kinda look alike so I can understand this one happening. But how a person look like Shrek, who has green skin? \ud83d\ude02", "Nope, NTA.  \nI have seen some truly horrendous tattoos, some people seem to be super proud of these too.  \nA woman I know had a portrait of her son on her shoulder, the photo looked like a typical portrait, the tattoo looked like Bart Simpson on drugs, drawn by a 10 year old.", "My friend's husband has a tattoo of her. But not like she looks, like the heavily filtered Instagram version of her. I love them both so much, but god it's a bad tattoo.", "It likely was a black and white tattoo.", "I don\u2019t see your point. If you had gone up to that woman and asked \u201cis that a tattoo of Bart Simpson on drugs drawn by a 10 year old?\u201d you would have also been an asshole."]}
