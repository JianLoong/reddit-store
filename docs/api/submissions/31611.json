So I currently am still childfree and pay about 2k a month in child support which is the maximum amount here. So recently she got into some pretty major health complications that left her unable to care for the kid. She asked me if it was possible for me to take in the kid for the next year which is what her doctors estimated would be required for her to heal from her temporary paralysis.\n\nI refused cause its not like the kid was going into foster care or anything they were just going to go live with their aunt which is a 4 hour drive away. However she insulted me about how i was making a already tough time for the kid even harder by making her have to move away from her friends and the people she knows into a completely new place.\n\nSo AITA", "created_utc": 1700808802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182m2fm/aita_for_refusing_to_take_in_my_daughter_so_that/", "score": 853, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You both wanted to be childfree and were clear about that, it sounds like. She changed her mind when she became pregnant, you didn't. Both fine. She chose to bring up the child as a single parent and you are doing your duty by paying child support. Also both fine. Now she can't take care of her child, through no fault of her own, so it's understandable she's asking you. However, taking in a child you don't want, not far a weekend but a year, possibly longer...  No, as long as there are other options (and I'm really hoping the aunt loves her and wants to take her in), I think it's actually better for both of you if she doesn't move in with you.", "People here happily ignoring that a good family is about *emotional* bonds; blood is only the starting point and in no way an indication of how beneficial the relationships actually are for all involved. \n\nYou\u2019d rather have your kid be with someone who\u2019s clearly expressed they don\u2019t want them there instead of someone who does, just so they can avoid a few hours\u2019 travel? That\u2019s heartless AF. \n\nNTA.", "Easy NAH. You both agreed on an arrangement where your role would be solely monetary. Unfortunately, she is no longer in a position to care for this child herself. That doesn\u2019t mean you are now responsible. She isn\u2019t the asshole for not wanting to uproot the child\u2019s life anymore than you aren\u2019t for not wanting to take on a child you previously stated you didn\u2019t want to have.", "NTA \nYou know you\u2019re not fit for the job. You pay the maximum you can for this child to be taken care of. I think it\u2019s best that you stay completely away as you have. The child needs love and affection and you don\u2019t have it. And that is ok!", "It'd be easy to say YTA here if we ignore the fact that you'd both agreed prior to not wanting children.   \nYou mention you broke up because she wanted to keep it, I take it this means terminating or adoption or something else was in fact an option for her that she did not want to pursue correct?   \nIf so, NTA.   \nThe reality is that had it been the other way around, you wanted it and she didnt people would be shouting at you \"her body her choice!\"   \nThis is also a case of her body and her choice, you are paying child support and fulfilling your legal financial obligations, as much as your outlook towards your own child disgusts me no, you're not ta.   \nKids shouldn't live with people who don't want them, her moving might be difficult but she can make new friends.   \nI'd imagine getting over living with her father who clearly doesn't want her would be harder to get over.", "With the information given I have to say NAH. \n\n1. Both were in agreement to be child free\n2. Unplanned pregnancy occurs and she decides to proceed with the pregnancy and raise the child.\n3. You pay the max amount of child support\n4. There is alternative care available.\n\nJudging by how you are adamant about being child free, I'm going to assume you used protection. \n\nY'all need to remember that birth control is not 100% effective. He could have wrapped up and she could be on the pill, doesn't mean both couldn't have failed. The probabilities go down but unless you're abstaining no method is guaranteed. And before anyone says he could have been snipped, a spontaneous reversal is possible. No information about his birth control practice was stated and that's not what we're asked to make judgment on.\n\nThe issue about it takes 2 to make a baby, her body her choice, and so on. It is her body and it was her choice. She chose to have sex with OP, she made a choice to have the baby. These were her choices. OP chose to pay child support, and he chose to not be an active father figure. She made a choice that he didn't really agree with, and he made a choice that she probably wasn't happy with. But they both made choices and had to live with what the other person decided. \n\nAnd honestly if she had gone the sperm donor route in order to have a child you would say she is being unreasonable for expecting the donor to step up and be a parent.\n\nThe thing is depending on where they live, OP could have signed away his parental rights in order to not pay child support. He is at least taking financial responsibility for his child. While a child requires more than financial support, OP has recognized that he doesn't have it in him to provide it. This could be a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand he isn't around his child actively resenting her or other negative actions, on the other hand the child will get to a point where they know they weren't wanted.\n\nAs for housing the child for a year, honestly it's better that she goes to the aunt. If all OP has done is pay child support, she has no relationship with her sperm donor. She'll basically be living with a stranger whom she knows didn't want her.\n\nThe biggest victim is the child, both parents were selfish, albeit in different ways.", "nta, there was a similar post where a woman who didn't want to have children had been convinced to have the child on the understanding she would not be part of its life. the father was moaning that she wasn't beyou d paying child maintenance, I think she over paid even.  everyone told him he made his choices so he could deal with it. this is the same you were clear you take care of the child from a responsibility perspective but the child will be better off somewhere she is loved. \n\nthe child is not necessarily better with het father just because he is her father, a loving aunt would be better. \n\nop don't forget to change who the maintinace goes to.", "NAH. \n\nWould I want to stay with a strange man or my aunty. Probably going to choose my aunty on that one", "NTA. 2 types of protection failed, and your ex changed her mind on keeping it.

Shame.", "NAH, but also you're practically a stranger to this child?", "NTA! The Reddit bias is coming through HARD in this one. There is zero mention of what measures you were using for BC yet somehow it\u2019s all your fault. \n\nYou may have been a willing participant in the act that ended up creating this child but you were a completely unwilling participant in the birth of said child. Your ex is fully responsible for the birth and is trying once again to make you a parent instead of a sperm donor.", "Poor kid", "NTA\n\nYou agreed you both wanted to be child free and you were practicing safe sex. \n\nShe made the choice to keep the baby regardless and you are doing the financially responsible thing and paying child support. You don\u2019t owe anyone an emotional relationship, and in this case the mother is 100% to blame for the child\u2019s future issues around this. It sucks but it is what it is.\n\nI know you can\u2019t travel back in time but have you considered a vasectomy now?", "You're obviously not capable of taking care of your daughter. Whether or not that makes you an AH or not doesn't matter.\n\nYou are NTA for not taking on this responsibility you clearly aren't able to carry. \nYour kid would be miserable with you, unfortunately.\n\nI feel for your ex and your child, but the kid isn't better off with a parent who isn't even capable of seeing her as his daughter, not really anyway. It's good you contribute to her life in a monetary way, it is your responsibility since you participated in making her.\n\nI think you're being the best dad you can be, even if that's not a very good dad at all.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't want the kid.\n\nShe did.\n\nAnd you're paying top dollars for it EVERY MONTH.\n\nAnd now she also wants you to take the kid in.\n\nLIVING WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE THE FATHER IS NOT BENEFICIAL FOR THE KID\n\nThe mother is selfish for pushing that option only 'cause she doesn't want the kid to be living 4 hours away with the aunt.", "NTA - sounds absolutely fair considering the circumstances", "NTA, largely because it seems like you would hold no love or affection for this child, and it would be far worse for her mental health in the long run. Especially if she was to lose her mom due to the health complications. Instead she just has to grow up with a dad that detests her.\n\nFor future reference though, you are not \u201cstill childfree\u201d. You have a child, whether you like it or not, regardless of if you choose to be involved in their life. People also don\u2019t just \u201cget\u201d pregnant. If you were choosing to be childfree, I sure as shit hope you were using protection every single time you have sex (and still are). Even better, get a vasectomy. They aren\u2019t 100% guarantees, but the chances are pretty minuscule.", "NTA.  You broke up when the kid happened, why on Ao's green earth would she think you'd be willing to take her for a whole year?", "I go with NTA\n\nIf i understand it correct you do not have any relationship with your child and only pay childsupport. Living with you (wo she doesn't really know) in her old town vs. living with her mom in a new town - both is shitty for the kid, but i would say having her primary person around is more important at that age. Ppl move, thats life, she will make new friends.\n\nDid her mom consider that if your daughter lives with you she wouldn't get childsupport anymore?", "INFO: were you both using every precaution you could to insure she didn\u2019t get pregnant when she did? Ex: condoms, birth control etc.", "NTA the kids better off without you", "Maybe from this post some people will realise telling us adamant childfree folks \u2018you would be a great parent\u2019 or \u2018it is different when it is your own\u2019 is a bad bad idea since we are not \u2018all words\u2019", "NTA it better for the kid this way.

Don\u2019t open the can of worms if you don\u2019t plan for her to be permanently in your life. \n\nAll these people claiming you\u2019re an AH for choosing not to go through an elective surgery when you were in a relationship with someone who also claimed to be CF, and also decided sex with you was fine as is, are quite frankly ridiculous. I say this as a CF woman who would abort at the earliest opportunity if it came to it. \n\nYour body, your choice too.

Instead of someone (the aunt) that the child presumably is already familiar with? Seriously???\n\nOP has no relationship with this child, has no experience how to handle this child at all.

But you both agreed that you wanted to be child free. She wanted the kid over you so she has to deal with the consequences. \n\nYou had no contact with your kid. You are a stranger to the kid.

Like why would he have to go to any surgery or anything if both the partner agree to a child free intercourse! And still she got pregnant! How??\nSecondly he didn't wanted a child and both agreed on that, yet she chose to be pregnant and give birth to the child, so why does he have to pay any financial aid to her or take any kind of responsibility of the child when it was totally her decision and her alone!!\nNow many might get triggered and attack me in the comments but before that just answer this, do Single Mothers (by choice) expect financial aid physical aid from the sperm donor? Isn't their marital situation similar to it!!", "You have a child, you are not childfree.  \n\nYTA get a vasectomy.", "NTA. The way you laid out this story is shockingly callous and offputting, which I think is why people are calling you TA. But looking at the facts you\u2019ve laid out, I do think you\u2019re NTA.

I just really feel for the child, who didn\u2019t ask for any of this.", "Usually \"childfree\" means you take responsible measures to avoid having children, but you've decided it means get someone pregnant and then pretend you don't have a kid.\n\nYTA of the worst sort. Stop harming the child you created.", "I get that you both agreed to be child free, but it appears you did not take any concrete steps from your end to ensure that. That being said it's better for the child to be somewhere were it will be treated with some amount of love and caring rather than with a person who doesn't feel anything for it. It's a tough time for the child, you are not going to be a good caretaker for her emotional needs.\n\n\nI don't really have a verdict.", "For multiple reasons, this one is pretty easy.  NTA.", "NTA you both made a choice to be child free. She changed her mind. You're paying child support. Anything beyond that is her issue.", "NTA. A lot of people here are glossing over the fact that \u201cstepping up\u201d isn\u2019t always the right thing. There are plenty of people who willfully had kids (planned or wanted them) that are absolutely not fit to be parents. Someone who likely resents the child\u2019s circumstances if not the child itself and is adamantly childfree is NOT someone who should be responsible for the kid. \n\nShe agreed to raise that child alone. She knew what the consequences of her keeping her child would be. She can\u2019t change that now and she should be grateful you\u2019re paying so much in support.", "So, to summarise:\n\n1. You and your ex-wife both agreed to be child free, and yet you (OP) participated in unprotected sex and then divorced her when she became pregnant and chose not to have an abortion or put the child up for adoption;\n2. Your ex-wife has experienced such major health complications that she has been left *temporarily paralysed* and currently unable to care for the child you have together;\n3. The other option for your child's care is to move 4 hours away, removing her from her friends and sent to an entirely new place for about a **year**, only to then (at some point) have to leave *that* new place and return home when their mother (hopefully) gets better;\n4. You've decided that you can't offer to care for your child.\n\nYou are *absolutely* the asshole.\n\nI fully accept and understand that you wish to be childfree (so do I), and for whichever reason you wilfully had unprotected sex (even if she was on birth control, which is by no means a 100% effective method of preventing pregnancy) with your wife which lead to her becoming pregnant, but from the very beginning, you've refused any degree of responsibility for the child you share with your ex.\n\nThe reason I say this is because your ex has been dealing with *major health complications*, to the degree where she is **currently paralysed** (temporarily or no), and yet up until now you've seemingly offered zero assistance or support with your child. And no, I'm not referring to the child support you seem to be paying (which is genuinely good to hear), but to the fact that she has already experienced this complication and she is still the primary caregiver for your child.\n\nFurther, you've decided that its not your responsibility to take care of her while your ex hopefully heals from this complication, because its seemingly not a big deal. I fully understand, again, the desire to be childfree, but is the idea of caring for your 6(ish) year old so horrendous for you that you couldn't do this favour for a *year*? Your child's age is a very formative and impressionable one; by moving away for a year, they're missing out on forming important friendships and connections which will carry them through primary school (and possibly even secondary education, depending on your area and school zones) and then eventually having to leave behind the friendships and connections they *do* make once they move back in with their mother.\n\nI'm not saying that you need to have a relationship with your child if you don't want one. But for you to not be willing to make such a short-term compromise in light of the situation *absolutely* makes you the asshole here and I don't even remotely blame your ex. She's correctly pointed out the impact your actions will have on your child, and you've taken it as an insult because, what, she's right and you don't want to admit it?\n\n**EDIT:** A couple commenters have let me know that you mentioned using condoms in a reply to another comment, which is great info to have. However, others have made an excellent point that I glossed over initially; if you were so insistent on being childfree, was having a vasectomy not under consideration? If you knew you never wanted children, this would have certainly been the most responsible and fool-proof option, rather than putting such a degree of responsibility on your wife to ensure she was taking her birth control routinely when BC already doesn't have 100% success rates.\n\nRegardless, as I already stated, it isn't only this original lack of forethought that leads me to believe YTA, it's the following lack of responsibility. Not in regards to the existing arrangement, because from what you've said it's worked fine up until now, but in regards to the fact that your ex is now *severely* medically impacted and you don't seem to understand that you still bear responsibilities, whether you originally wanted to or not, and not only refuse to show any degree of care or compassion for said responsibilities but then try to claim your ex \"insulted\" you when all she did, from what we know, is rightfully point out the truth of the matter.", "YTA. This is your kid, whether you wanted her or not. How can anyone be so callous?\n\nThen again, it's probably better for her to end up in a loving environment four hours away rather than be stuck with an unfeeling prick like you.", "I'm gonna go for NTA.\n\nYour personal reasons asides, I think it's pretty fair. You guys agreed to go child-free. She got pregnant, accident or not, and wanted to keep the child, so you guys broke up. You DO pay child support at the maximum amount, therefore you have fulfilled your responsibility as an involuntary sperm donator. You're basically a stranger to your daughter, so you can do whatever you want. Charity is good, people praise you when you do it, but you not doing it doesn't mean you're an AH.", "NTA- if she decided to keep the child and you pay child support you have fulfilled your obligations. And really, as a mom, why would I send my child to someone they don't know that doesn't want them? I would consider myself TA for putting my kid in that situation instead of with family they know and have a bond with. She made her decision to keep the baby and not have an abortion or doing an adoption. Children don't just go away because of health issues. I raised 2 while battling cancer. Was it hard? yes. Would I send them to someone they didn't have a relationship with just to make things a easier on me? Hell no.", "There is a HUGE hole here.\n\nDoes \"the kid\" know you?

It doesn't matter that you agreed on not having children, because the child is here and you are her father. I cannot imagine how much you are hurting her with your attitude or why you don't care.

Poor child, my heart goes out to her.", "Well, you're defintely coming off as cold-hearted unempathetic bastard who doesn't have a shred of warmth or decency towards people who were once your family, but technically I guess it's NAH. \n\nYour ex is *temporarily paralyzed*, and *YOUR* child is going to end up struggling immensely and since she/he is going to end up being shipped away 4 hours away and will be unable to visit the only parent who actually *wanted* them,  and they will be cut off from their entire social support network during an extreme time of need, which will definitely be psychologically damaging to them. Its not unreasonable for your ex to want what's best for your kid. She sounds like a good parent. But I guess that's not your responsibility? You're not legally obligated, even if it would be decent thing to do.\n\nPersonally, I would provide room, food, and board to a distant relatives child, but that's just me. So NAH.", "NTA about refusing to take in \"the kid\" as you clearly don't care about your daughter and you'll only neglect her anyway so she's better off with her aunt but YTA regarding your attitude towards an innocent child whose only crime was to be born", "Gotta go with NTA here. Now, don't get me wrong, your lack of empathy is alarming, and you come across as a self riotous p***k, but that doesn't make you TA in this situation. You both agreed to be child free and took precautions to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, but it happened anyway. Your ex changed her mind, which she is allowed to do, but you didn't, also allowed. You pay the maximum child support to make sure the child doesn't go without but play no part in the child's life, which was agreed upon when the child was born. \nThe situation your ex finds herself in is unfortunate but its not your problem and you taking in a child that you don't know and don't care for is not in the best interests of the child, staying with loving family is the best option here for everyone, it's not like the child is going into foster care she is staying with family and its only for a year tops so the social aspect of moving 4 hours away isn't going to be as big a deal as people are making out after all she's 6 not 16. \nAlso to touch on the child free aspect if the roles were reversed and you wanted to keep the child but your ex didn't then you would have had no say in the matter, she could have ended the pregnancy or put the baby up for adoption and you wouldn't have been able to stop her so why is it women can decide to walk away from an unwanted pregnancy and its all about her body her choice but if a man walks away then he is the bad guy even if he pays child support. And before anyone says anything, I'm a mother who's ex's walked away before her children were born and never received a penny in child support. \n1 last thing stop saying you are child free because you're not, like it or not you have a daughter you just refuse to acknowledge her existence other than the 2k you pay each month.
