Often times they\u2019ll try to set me up with men they know or ask me if I want children. \n\nRecently my wife and I were talking about how she  wants to enrol our daughters in the school I teach at when they are old enough. I then explained how that would create an awkward situation because my coworkers don\u2019t know about our family.

It's also not good for your kids in the long run, as they may also feel that you're ashamed of them.\n\nThere probably are LGBT families or even LGBT kids at your school, and you could be a role model for them. But, otoh, you have good reason to fear for your job. I don't know what the employment opportunities are in your area. I know where I am, good teachers are hard to find. If you don't think you can stand up and be proud of your family at your current school, I think you need to find a job at a school where you can do that. \n\nNAH.", "N T A for not telling the people at work, but your wife just finding out about this now makes YTA. You should\u2019ve been open with her about your decision and concerns from the beginning.", "This is a rough one and i can see both sides. I live in a fairly conservative state and have heard stories of teachers being canned shortly after coming out as gay. I guess NAH.", "I have to go with NAH.\n\nYou say you work in a private school, so I assume that it is a pretty conservative environment.  I can understand that you may feel there could be repercussions in the workplace if what happens in your personal life becomes public.  These are not your friends. You are there to do a job.  Honestly, it isn't any of their business and it shouldn't be.  But you are the best person to decide how you handle your personal information because it is your personal situation.  \n\nI also see how your wife could come to the conclusion she did, but you need to explain that you are not ashamed of your family. You are ashamed of your workplace-or at least, you should be.\n\nMy question (and my worry) for you is-how are you going to handle it when you are out with your family and you run into a co-worker?  As the kids get older and more involved with the world, this is almost inevitable.  Are you going to lie to your co-worker to protect your privacy (which will teach your children the absolute wrong message), or are you going to introduce your family and face the consequences at work?", "I would hate to be my wife's secret.", "This is a very difficult decision for you, and I can appreciate that there are risks associated with coming out in a professional environment. At the same time, I am sure your wife wants you to be open and proud of who you are and of your relationship with her. So you both have valid points and there is no easy solution. \n\nHowever, I will say that I think the issue is not your keeping your personal life to yourself from your colleagues, but your not sharing with your wife that you were doing so. Has this issue never been raised in the 4 years you have been married? I would have thought this would be something you would discuss and make decisions about together.", "NAH.  You\u2019re both right.  If you\u2019re in the U.S., depending on where you are and whether or not your school has a religious affiliation, you could open yourself up for termination because private schools don\u2019t have union protection.  That will land your family in a bad economic situation with little warning. You could also open yourself up to harassment from parents.  The behavior out there is practically feral right now.  You\u2019d need to know for sure your school admin would have your back if you were to come out at work.  If you have any doubts, do nothing.  It\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not fair, but you have to protect your ability to provide for your family and keep them safe.\n\nOn the other hand, she\u2019s not wrong about her feelings regarding your not being out at school.\n\nYou may need to sweat out this school year and then look into moving into the public school sector in a larger city next year so you can openly be who you are.  That may be the necessary compromise.  Your wife may need to be willing to move if you get a job in a different city.\n\nI say this as a retired teacher.  I\u2019ve seen it all, and it\u2019s way too easy to get fired from a private school, and it can happen on the flimsiest of pretexts.  You and your wife need to really consider all possible ramifications and how you\u2019ll manage them if you decide to come out.", "YTA, *not* because you're not to your colleagues, but because you didn't let your wife know that you're keeping her and your children a secret. It's horrible that you feel like you need to, and that's really hard to deal with. But your wife 1) has just found out that you have studiously avoided letting anyone know about her existence and 2) has just found out that you've gone through this difficult thing without telling her.\n\nIt's a reasonable expectation that when you're married, you know what's going on in your spouse's life. She must be feeling pretty alarmed by this compartmentalization. Right now she feels like your dirty little secret and she feels like you didn't trust her enough to confide in her.", "NAH I think you both have valid opinions.", "INFO: is the private school you work at religious based?", "NTA. These aren't your friends you have chosen, they are a bunch of strangers you spend time with because you get paid to. They don't get to form any sort of opinion about you, personal and professional separation to me is different than if you were hiding it from your friends and family.", "nta. i dont tell my coworkers anything about me", "INFO are your coworkers openly homophobic? Is the area you live in more conservative? Would you have gotten more time off for leave if you had used maternity leave?", "NAH, although this is really a major issue about how your family relate to the world that would best have been discussed with your wife long before now. Ultimately would have been your decision to make because it\u2019s you at work with these people but wife deserved to know and provide her thoughts and feelings. \n\nJust want to point out separately that your approach to keeping this secret, while maybe the right decision for you and not one I want to second-guess, is exactly what the anti-LGBTQ contingent wants for all non-hetero couples when they say things like \u2018just don\u2019t shove your sexual orientation down our throats,\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t sexual use the classroom by discussing your orientation with students.\u2019 Straight teachers have the unquestioned privilege of not feeling any pressure to hide their marriages families from their classrooms and colleagues. It creates a lot of mental anguish and pressure to feel the need to hide such a fundamentally important and also very normal part of your life from those you work with.", "OP, it was wrong to keep it a secret from your wife, but I can see how it would just kind of... not come up in a conversation, so I hesitate to call you an AH.\n\nThat said, please don't send your kids to school where you teach - your kids will guaranteed to be treated differently by students and colleagues alike, please don't do that to them.", "Why would you want your child to go to a school where she has to lie about her parents?", "NTA. I am straight and my co-workers no nothing about my relationship and home life. You don't have to tell your co-workers anything.", "I think YTA right now.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping your privacy. I don't think you own your coworker your personal info. So n t a in that aspect.\n\nBut, letting it affect your life to a point where you don't want to enroll your kids in your school makes you the ash. \n\nThat crosses the line over - I am a private person- to: I keep my family a secret.\n\nAlso, I feel like you don't have to make a big deal out of it. Couldn't you have said \"oh yes I'm married\" or something over the last 8 years? That part about them trying to introduce to someone doesn't sit right with me. \n\nThe whole situation makes me wonder. What's the problem? Are your coworkers overbearing?  Or you're overprotective of your personal life?", ">Often times they\u2019ll try to set me up with men they know or ask me if I want children\n\nThat is when you became YTA. If the conversation never came up it's fine to never mention it, but that is definitely a scenario where it's time to set the record straight. At least a \"actually, I'm married.\"", "Soooooo\u2026\u2026. 8 years is a LONG time to work someplace and maintain a solid wall between \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d. \n\nAs others have said, I wouldn\u2019t want to be kept a secret.  And based on your post, your wife assumed she wasn\u2019t a secret\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019ve been married for 4 years-  you say that your socialize \u201csomewhat regularly\u201d with your co-workers.   I don\u2019t know\u2026.. it just seems \u201coff\u201d to me.     Your co-workers are comfortable enough to try to set you up on dates and ask if you want kids.  Yet you\u2019ve never once felt safe enough to be forthcoming?  \n\nBack to the time span again.   After dating and marrying, you went thru a challenging IVF experience, into a twin pregnancy, and now at this point you have two toddlers ( just under 2).  DAMN that\u2019s  A LOT of life changing / happy/ ecstatic / sad / stressful  / exhausting / scary / irritating / joyful ( I\u2019m running out of emotions here) moments.  And you\u2019ve kept them ALL bottled up?  Never once boiled over and confided in a co-worker?  Talked about how scared you were when the babies were i\u2019ll?  Or how overjoyed you were with their first smiles and first steps?  \n\nNot only that - but how have you not had to explain a last minute, unplanned or extended absence?  ( I\u2019m just thinking medical/baby/toddler/sick spouse related absences\u2026\u2026)\n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say.  My heart goes out to you, that\u2019s for sure.   Your wife being \u201cextremely angry\u201d with you leads me to believe that you probably don\u2019t live in an ultra conservative region.  (If you did, your wife wouldn\u2019t have been shocked you kept your family life on the down-low. \n\nWhat i absolutely don\u2019t get is how  this topic has never come up before between you and your wife.  This can\u2019t possibly be the first time you\u2019ve talked about schools.  Damn my teacher friends started talking shiny that before their kids were even conceived!  Has unit wife  ever questioned why there aren\u2019t any work social events ( weddings, dinners, holiday gatherings)  or anything like that?  Do you ever talk with her about work stuff, your coworkers, etc at home?  Or do you keep it separate both ways?  I don\u2019t know - I\u2019m really perplexed by this\u2026\u2026.", "Sorry but YTA. Not telling your co-workers is fine; not telling your wife no one at your job knows her and your kids exist is not.", "YTA. How private you are at work about your sexuality and relationships is normally your business. Except now it\u2019s impacting your wife and daughters. But for your fear (rational or not) over the response you\u2019d receive to coming out, you\u2019d no doubt enroll your daughters in your school without any reservations. You\u2019re asking your wife and daughters to endure unnecessary burdens because of your fear. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to put on your big girl panties and just do the right thing. And if you live in the US, there\u2019s a robust set of state and federal laws protecting you from retaliation in your job based on your sexuality. Listen to your wife.", "YTA - not for deciding to not tell your coworkers youre married and have kids, but for deciding to not tell your wife about this choice.", "YTA for not telling your wife you were keeping her and your family a secret from your coworkers for so long.", "YTA but only because of your wife not knowing this. Your coworkers don't have the right to know about anything about you beyond what you choose to share, but keeping this from your wife wasn't a smart decision.", "Right in the middle on this one, cause yes I get not advertising your home life, there's no need to at work. I also get that shit might happen if you say something.\n\nBut at the same time, I would've been honest when people tried to set me up. That way they know why you're saying no and not to do it again.\n\nAnd I truly do get it, I'm a bi woman with a lesbian wife, so yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. I don't advertise at work but some people know because I'm not going to lie about something like that.", "NAH. Your wife has a point but you aren't required to be a standard bearer and setting lines between private and work life is a viable survival strategy. The situation, however, stinks.", "I get being afraid of being Out in that setting. Especially if you\u2019re in the states. But!!! \n\nYou\u2019ve worked there long enough that this should not have surprised your wife - so YTA for that. This should not have surprised her at all. Not come as a shock. This should have been discussed openly between the two of you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not sure specifically where you live, and in 2023, it's understandable that since the pride community has been so aggressively and unfairly attacked and targeted that it's OK you have felt the need to be protective.\n\nEspecially in schools! Teachers have lost their jobs or experience massive bigotry from parents and kids. \n\nLike, you cannot feel as safe and free as straight people.", "I can see where your wife is coming from but NTA as long as you never lied to her about being out. \n\nIf it\u2019s a religious school it\u2019s really important to be careful, they can be weird about such things. But then, we\u2019re apparently banning books now, so being a teacher is scary just in general. \n\nThat said, what happens if the kids get sick? If your wife gets sick? One day you will likely have to tell someone at work that you have a family thing. It\u2019s worth considering. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal of it, but it\u2019s going to come up.", "NTA for wanting to have kept it private in the past, because there are so many potential repercussions. Depending where you are, you could lose your job. And harassment (physical and otherwise) is a legit concern.\n\nBut. When you have children, isn't this going to be hard to do, going forward, as they get older? Seems to me it's going to be increasingly impractical to not be out. And if someone else finds out, and decides to out you first, you lose the chance to define the narrative. \n\nI think you'll have to bite the bullet and come out.", "YTA for not telling her about this a long time ago. However, I totally relate to the reasons why. Things are becoming more hostile out there for our community.", "NTA  Your coworkers do not need to know your personal life. For one thing, you don't know how they will react. Is it really  idea for any kid to go to school where a parent works? Other kids think they might be getting special treatment.", "YTA I get not getting friendly with coworkers - I don\u2019t engage much beyond professional- but you\u2019re going above and beyond and it\u2019ll be detrimental to your children.", "YTA. It's unreasonable.  Enroll them and treat it as it is, no big deal. If anyone asks just say \"Oh, I didn't tell you? I'm sure I did. Huh. no big deal, right?\"", "You're NTA for not telling your coworkers about your private life. They aren't entitled to know whether you're married, have kids, are gay or straight or whatever. This is doubly true because you work for a private school and those are typically religious, conservative, and bigoted toward the LGBT+ community.\n\nYTA for not telling your wife from the get-go that you weren't going to mention that your marital and familial status to your coworkers. Because that can very easily come across as trying to hide her, stay closeted, etc.\n\nI'm a private person. I don't tell my coworkers my business or life story. I'm also single. If I started dating someone and didn't want my coworkers to know for some reason, I'd mention it to my partner so they weren't surprised down the road and thought it was a reflection on them.", "YTA\n\nI understand your fears, but I strongly believe there is nothing more important to be true to your family and to be proud and thankful for having them.\n\nSo don\u2019t hide them from the others. Be proud of them.", "NAH. \n\nFind a teacher friend you really connect with and trust and come out to them first as a test run.", "You know what? NTA, and I say this because I (a \"B\" in the LBGT community) live in FL and it's not pleasant and often dangerous for the LGBT community here.

Actually, I don't think you're hiding it, but you're choosing to keep your private life and your career separate. All it would take to ruin your career is for a small group of parents to say that they are 'fearful of any LGBQTIA+ rhetoric that you would expose their children to' and you'll find yourself ostracized to an insane degree that would see you having to leave your current school (especially if you live in a 'red' state) and eventually see you drummed out of the profession altogether.\n\nShould you have the ability to share your life as much or as little as you want without fear of reprisal?

I thought I was doing so well \u2026 until I happened to move elsewhere after many years. The new place was very different and I felt freer to be all of myself. I\u2019m still tripping over hang ups and fears and like weird internal reactions traceable back to being on-guard all the time, and marveling at how comfortable I am. \n\nWhat I thought was just a small sacrifice to keep the peace was quietly eroding my sense of safety and self. \n\nI know it\u2019s easy to suggest others make big life changes like moving or finding a new job, but I urge you to at least think it through as an option. You and you wife and your twins deserve to be 100% confident that you are surrounded by support. I know that\u2019s hard to find (especially these days and especially for LGBTQ+ folks), but it\u2019s worth it if you can swing it. \n\nI wish you and your family peace and harmony whatever decision you ultimately make. You deserve that.", "Nta", "This should have been an ongoing discussion with your wife. If there was a death in the family and calling your work would out you and maybe cost you your job, should you not have communicated with her? \n\nI completely support people in coming out when they're ready, but massive YTA for not using your grown up words and being honest with your wife.", "You should have told your wife before now. You definitely have some valid emotion around this. I empathize with you as a lesbian myself. When I worked in Indiana I didn\u2019t talk about my sexuality at all. But I did confide in my partner about that and we came to an agreement together. \n\nNo one should ever have to come out and your safety and livelihood are important.", "I think it\u2019s very reasonable and rational to keep your personal life as far from your professional life as you can, especially when prejudice is so rampant. You\u2019re not ashamed, you\u2019re protecting yourself and your family. When tempers cool another conversation is in order. NTA", "Mild YTA for not telling your wife sooner. I've been there...where I'm from there are a lot of religious people and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments, to the point where it's very ingrained in the culture. I kept my long distance girlfriend secret in some circumstances until I either left said place, or I was absolutely sure that it would be okay to tell people. But I was honest with her about it. While it was upsetting to both of us that this was even necessary (until I moved to her country), she understood why I did it. Communication is important, and I think you should apologise to your wife for not making the situation clear to her earlier.", "Your not wrong, 8 out of 10 ppl are judgemental\u2026 ppl\nTry to act all high and mighty that they are not. I\u2019m fact they are and most of the time hypocrites! It\u2019s none of there fucking business! Stay to your self and keep away from ppl, they will only hate!", "NAH. My mom taught at my high school. It sucked lol. \n\nI\u2019m straight and I don\u2019t discuss my personal life with coworkers.", "Do you really think you can keep all this a secret . . . forever?\n\nOnly you know if your safety would be affected if you came out.  Just know that to reduce one stress (coworkers *possibly* being homophobic) you have taken on the stress of keeping your spouse and family a secret.  Eventually you will have to flat out lie to keep that secret.\n\nFor me, personally, the lying and secrecy was never worth it, because being deceptive about *who one is,* is damaging to yourself and the relationship to your spouse and children.\n\nAgain, you know what is safe in your area, or not.  For me, being publicly \"out\" means I know who has my back and who doesn't.  That is valuable information to have.  Plus, I would never deny my marriage to a wonderful woman!  Or having beautiful twins!", "NAH. This is so hard. I understand her feelings entirely, but I also get being worried in today's climate. Depending on where you live, your career as a teacher could even be in jeopardy, or at least in danger of being scrutinized in a scary way. There's no easy answer here unfortunately. I hope you're able to talk this out with her and figure out something you can both be comfortable with.", "NAH, you have the right to disclose or keep aspects of your life a secret from your coworkers. Your wife also has the right to feel angry and that you must be ashamed of her and your kids. I feel also obligated to mention that, at this point, there is no way you not telling your coworkers about your situation doesnt blow up in your face unless you leave pretty quick. Personally I would feel very hurt if i found out that one of my coworkers had a family that they purposefully kept hidden for fear of reprisal.", "Nta i really do not get why your wive is so offended by that. Its none of your coworkers business how you live your life and its not like you'd hide the fact from people that actually matter like family and friends", "So as a woman(35F) married to my wife(39F), here is what I do. I use gender neutral terms referring to my spouse (my other half, my spouse, my partner) and let ppl assume whatever gender they want. It's a need to know bases and they don't need to know. If they ask, I won't deny it.", ">otoh, you have good reason to fear for your job\n\nAnd possibly their safety. Attitudes towards ~~hay~~ gay couples have gone backwards at an alarming rate in some areas.\n\nMy coworkers daughter is a childminder (daycare). When one of the mums saw her out with her wife, she turned up at their house next day. Screaming about them being perverts, including threats that their partner would come and kick both their heads in. She did this *in front of the other children*.\n\nThis is an average, middle class woman who had previously been very friendly. Nothing to indicate she was like this. Didn't fit any of the LGBTI hating stereotypes. Some homophobes hide it really well until they explode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for correction. OP is not a horse.", "It's especially tricky bc it's a private school. That means no union to protect OP from retaliation.  If it's a religious school, forget about it.", "This. This is the response. Your co-workers, especially at a private school (that have as organizations been known to release LGBTQIA people for that reason), is fine. I mean, particularly if they never really inquired deeply enough to figure it out.\n\nYour wife having no idea, though?! That's not cool.", "This is 100% it.  I hate the concept of being a secret, so to be blindsided by that after 8 years would be rough...I'm just imagining having heard about all of these co-workers for years and knowing names or certain things about them and then all of a sudden realizing they don't even think/know I exist.  That's a gut punch.\n\nI'm in healthcare and while I'm open with my coworkers, I am intentionally not with patients.  Either no mention of an SO, or I use the word \"partner\" and don't correct them if they use the wrong pronouns.  So I totally understand OP on that front.  Sometimes you need to be safe to protect your job.\n\nHide whatever from your coworkers, but don't hide from your wife.", "That's horribly  sad", "It is also entirely legal in some US states to fire someone for their sexual orientation. NAH but OP should have a conversation with their partner about how they\u2019ll navigate this together going forward.", "That\u2019s horrible, aren\u2019t there anti discriminatory laws in the US which prevents the employer to fire on the basis of your sexuality", "Yea, it sucks that in the US there have been more than 550 bills just this year attacking and criminalizing the gay community, including laws to make it easier for them to lose their jobs. \n\nNo one should have to live like that.", "yeah, I sorta feel like that's the bigger issue. I understand where OP is coming from but still...", "That seems like such a huge burden to carry by yourself.", "I don't see how OP's position is unreasonable. With the backlash against the LGBTQ community over the last couple years, you have to be careful about who you trust. Teachers have absolutely been fired for being gay, and if this is a private school, coming out may end her employment.\n\nI'd say soft YTA to OP for not discussing with her wife first.", "teachers in general get so much shit for just being human, i can\u2019t blame op for not letting her work life in on her private life. but i also get why wifey\u2019s mad! like, i would want to at least be told that was happening. nah.", "Indeed.\n\nI can't imagine working in this kind of environment, and sending my kids there?!? If OP can find a new job, I think that would be the best for everyone involved.", "A union could just as well protect co-workers treating OP poorly as it would protect OP and she still has the same legal rights against retaliation with or sithout a union.", "I went to a private liberal arts college in a very liberal area. Three of my favorite professors were part of a class-action lawsuit because the school systemically was denying tenure to all of the lesbian and women of color professors regardless of how strong their tenure portfolios were. And that's for college. Homophobic people go insane when they realize that their small children have been 'exposed' to gay people who are just living their lives and doing their jobs like everyone else.", "The issue is a lot of conservative states have \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws that are basically designed to allow right-wing conservatives to discriminate against the LGBTQIA+ community.", "Yes but you\u2019d still have to prove it and go to court. Proving it is really hard, they usually just come up with an excuse as to why you\u2019re fired and a judge has a hard time proving otherwise.", "Why can't people just mind their own  business and treat everyone equally?", "I think the bigger issue is that being openly LGBTQ is dangerous in the USA, and what ever progress we had made in that department in the last 20 years has been rolled back.    \n\nHeck, being straight and having a pride flag in your shop as a show of support will get you shot and killed by random bigots.\n\nI don't blame the OP at all.    LGBTQ are the new GOP punching bags in their culture wars, and it can literally get you killed.    Not to mention fired from your work, kicked out of your rental (in some states), harassed and threatened, etc.", "I remember when I was going to school to be a teacher (before I realized it wasn\u2019t for me) and it was strongly recommended to dress modestly for everyone because that public image could get ruined so easily. Social media was recommended to be on private and we should really consider what we posted. We were told so many horror stories of people who had their careers ruined because of how they acted, what the posted, how they dressed. Someone had their career put on hold for a year cause they were drinking wine in the background of someone else\u2019s picture and they got tagged and the school they were going to get hired at saw and withdrew the offer letter. \n\nIt\u2019s truly horrifying what teachers need to do to not get fired and have their career trajectory changed forever.", "Unions protect all Members by being certain that the proper steps are followed to terminate any member. There is a misperception about unions at the local level.\n\nThink of it like insurance. If you get in trouble on the job you get representation from stewards or building reps for minor issues, to the local president for more serious ones, to legal teams for the worst issues.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you did, we have to represent you until the process plays out or you resign.\n\nI was a local president for a teacher's union for about fifteen years and have had to represent teachers who fought each other and both had their jobs on the line. I wasn't defending what either did, I was monitoring the process. They did both keep their jobs after a week unpaid.", "It's wild the existence of other humans is legislated in such a nasty and targted way...", "yeah, I'm not sure OP's solution is the best solution- because as others have pointed out, she's relying on never running into her coworkers when she's out with her wife and child.\n\nBut at the same time, I understand the stance she's taken and beyond her family moving to an area where she can get a job at a school- with a more liberal parent population so this isn't a concern- it's always going to be an unfair balancing act.", "Please cite a story where somebody was shot just for displaying a flag, otherwise just mention real examples there are more than enough", "[here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/storeowner-shot-dead-dispute-lgbtq-pride-flag/)", "It just happened recently: https://www.advocate.com/crime/lauri-carleton-killed-pride-flag", "It happened in Southern California last week. The store owner who was shot and killed was named Laura Ann Carlton.", "Just google California Pride flag shooting - it happened last week.   The victim was 66, named Laura Anne Carleton.  She was shot by 27 year old Travis Ikeguchi.    He was pissed because she had a pride flag up at her shop, and he shot and killed her."]}
