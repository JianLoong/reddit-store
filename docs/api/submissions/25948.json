Often times they\u2019ll try to set me up with men they know or ask me if I want children. \n\nRecently my wife and I were talking about how she  wants to enrol our daughters in the school I teach at when they are old enough. I then explained how that would create an awkward situation because my coworkers don\u2019t know about our family.

It's also not good for your kids in the long run, as they may also feel that you're ashamed of them.\n\nThere probably are LGBT families or even LGBT kids at your school, and you could be a role model for them. But, otoh, you have good reason to fear for your job. I don't know what the employment opportunities are in your area. I know where I am, good teachers are hard to find. If you don't think you can stand up and be proud of your family at your current school, I think you need to find a job at a school where you can do that. \n\nNAH.", "N T A for not telling the people at work, but your wife just finding out about this now makes YTA. You should\u2019ve been open with her about your decision and concerns from the beginning.", "This is a rough one and i can see both sides. I live in a fairly conservative state and have heard stories of teachers being canned shortly after coming out as gay. I guess NAH.", "I have to go with NAH.\n\nYou say you work in a private school, so I assume that it is a pretty conservative environment.  I can understand that you may feel there could be repercussions in the workplace if what happens in your personal life becomes public.  These are not your friends. You are there to do a job.  Honestly, it isn't any of their business and it shouldn't be.  But you are the best person to decide how you handle your personal information because it is your personal situation.  \n\nI also see how your wife could come to the conclusion she did, but you need to explain that you are not ashamed of your family. You are ashamed of your workplace-or at least, you should be.\n\nMy question (and my worry) for you is-how are you going to handle it when you are out with your family and you run into a co-worker?  As the kids get older and more involved with the world, this is almost inevitable.  Are you going to lie to your co-worker to protect your privacy (which will teach your children the absolute wrong message), or are you going to introduce your family and face the consequences at work?", "I would hate to be my wife's secret.", "This is a very difficult decision for you, and I can appreciate that there are risks associated with coming out in a professional environment. At the same time, I am sure your wife wants you to be open and proud of who you are and of your relationship with her. So you both have valid points and there is no easy solution. \n\nHowever, I will say that I think the issue is not your keeping your personal life to yourself from your colleagues, but your not sharing with your wife that you were doing so. Has this issue never been raised in the 4 years you have been married? I would have thought this would be something you would discuss and make decisions about together.", "NAH.  You\u2019re both right.  If you\u2019re in the U.S., depending on where you are and whether or not your school has a religious affiliation, you could open yourself up for termination because private schools don\u2019t have union protection.  That will land your family in a bad economic situation with little warning. You could also open yourself up to harassment from parents.  The behavior out there is practically feral right now.  You\u2019d need to know for sure your school admin would have your back if you were to come out at work.  If you have any doubts, do nothing.  It\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s not fair, but you have to protect your ability to provide for your family and keep them safe.\n\nOn the other hand, she\u2019s not wrong about her feelings regarding your not being out at school.\n\nYou may need to sweat out this school year and then look into moving into the public school sector in a larger city next year so you can openly be who you are.  That may be the necessary compromise.  Your wife may need to be willing to move if you get a job in a different city.\n\nI say this as a retired teacher.  I\u2019ve seen it all, and it\u2019s way too easy to get fired from a private school, and it can happen on the flimsiest of pretexts.  You and your wife need to really consider all possible ramifications and how you\u2019ll manage them if you decide to come out.", "YTA, *not* because you're not to your colleagues, but because you didn't let your wife know that you're keeping her and your children a secret. It's horrible that you feel like you need to, and that's really hard to deal with. But your wife 1) has just found out that you have studiously avoided letting anyone know about her existence and 2) has just found out that you've gone through this difficult thing without telling her.\n\nIt's a reasonable expectation that when you're married, you know what's going on in your spouse's life. She must be feeling pretty alarmed by this compartmentalization. Right now she feels like your dirty little secret and she feels like you didn't trust her enough to confide in her.", "NAH I think you both have valid opinions.", "INFO: is the private school you work at religious based?", "NTA. These aren't your friends you have chosen, they are a bunch of strangers you spend time with because you get paid to. They don't get to form any sort of opinion about you, personal and professional separation to me is different than if you were hiding it from your friends and family.", "nta. i dont tell my coworkers anything about me", "INFO are your coworkers openly homophobic? Is the area you live in more conservative? Would you have gotten more time off for leave if you had used maternity leave?", "NAH, although this is really a major issue about how your family relate to the world that would best have been discussed with your wife long before now. Ultimately would have been your decision to make because it\u2019s you at work with these people but wife deserved to know and provide her thoughts and feelings. \n\nJust want to point out separately that your approach to keeping this secret, while maybe the right decision for you and not one I want to second-guess, is exactly what the anti-LGBTQ contingent wants for all non-hetero couples when they say things like \u2018just don\u2019t shove your sexual orientation down our throats,\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t sexual use the classroom by discussing your orientation with students.\u2019 Straight teachers have the unquestioned privilege of not feeling any pressure to hide their marriages families from their classrooms and colleagues. It creates a lot of mental anguish and pressure to feel the need to hide such a fundamentally important and also very normal part of your life from those you work with.", "OP, it was wrong to keep it a secret from your wife, but I can see how it would just kind of... not come up in a conversation, so I hesitate to call you an AH.\n\nThat said, please don't send your kids to school where you teach - your kids will guaranteed to be treated differently by students and colleagues alike, please don't do that to them.", "Why would you want your child to go to a school where she has to lie about her parents?", "NTA. I am straight and my co-workers no nothing about my relationship and home life. You don't have to tell your co-workers anything.", "I think YTA right now.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with keeping your privacy. I don't think you own your coworker your personal info. So n t a in that aspect.\n\nBut, letting it affect your life to a point where you don't want to enroll your kids in your school makes you the ash. \n\nThat crosses the line over - I am a private person- to: I keep my family a secret.\n\nAlso, I feel like you don't have to make a big deal out of it. Couldn't you have said \"oh yes I'm married\" or something over the last 8 years? That part about them trying to introduce to someone doesn't sit right with me. \n\nThe whole situation makes me wonder. What's the problem? Are your coworkers overbearing?  Or you're overprotective of your personal life?", ">Often times they\u2019ll try to set me up with men they know or ask me if I want children\n\nThat is when you became YTA. If the conversation never came up it's fine to never mention it, but that is definitely a scenario where it's time to set the record straight. At least a \"actually, I'm married.\"", "Soooooo\u2026\u2026. 8 years is a LONG time to work someplace and maintain a solid wall between \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d. \n\nAs others have said, I wouldn\u2019t want to be kept a secret.  And based on your post, your wife assumed she wasn\u2019t a secret\u2026.\n\nYou\u2019ve been married for 4 years-  you say that your socialize \u201csomewhat regularly\u201d with your co-workers.   I don\u2019t know\u2026.. it just seems \u201coff\u201d to me.     Your co-workers are comfortable enough to try to set you up on dates and ask if you want kids.  Yet you\u2019ve never once felt safe enough to be forthcoming?  \n\nBack to the time span again.   After dating and marrying, you went thru a challenging IVF experience, into a twin pregnancy, and now at this point you have two toddlers ( just under 2).  DAMN that\u2019s  A LOT of life changing / happy/ ecstatic / sad / stressful  / exhausting / scary / irritating / joyful ( I\u2019m running out of emotions here) moments.  And you\u2019ve kept them ALL bottled up?  Never once boiled over and confided in a co-worker?  Talked about how scared you were when the babies were i\u2019ll?  Or how overjoyed you were with their first smiles and first steps?  \n\nNot only that - but how have you not had to explain a last minute, unplanned or extended absence?  ( I\u2019m just thinking medical/baby/toddler/sick spouse related absences\u2026\u2026)\n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say.  My heart goes out to you, that\u2019s for sure.   Your wife being \u201cextremely angry\u201d with you leads me to believe that you probably don\u2019t live in an ultra conservative region.  (If you did, your wife wouldn\u2019t have been shocked you kept your family life on the down-low. \n\nWhat i absolutely don\u2019t get is how  this topic has never come up before between you and your wife.  This can\u2019t possibly be the first time you\u2019ve talked about schools.  Damn my teacher friends started talking shiny that before their kids were even conceived!  Has unit wife  ever questioned why there aren\u2019t any work social events ( weddings, dinners, holiday gatherings)  or anything like that?  Do you ever talk with her about work stuff, your coworkers, etc at home?  Or do you keep it separate both ways?  I don\u2019t know - I\u2019m really perplexed by this\u2026\u2026.", "Sorry but YTA. Not telling your co-workers is fine; not telling your wife no one at your job knows her and your kids exist is not.", "YTA. How private you are at work about your sexuality and relationships is normally your business. Except now it\u2019s impacting your wife and daughters. But for your fear (rational or not) over the response you\u2019d receive to coming out, you\u2019d no doubt enroll your daughters in your school without any reservations. You\u2019re asking your wife and daughters to endure unnecessary burdens because of your fear. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to put on your big girl panties and just do the right thing. And if you live in the US, there\u2019s a robust set of state and federal laws protecting you from retaliation in your job based on your sexuality. Listen to your wife.", "YTA - not for deciding to not tell your coworkers youre married and have kids, but for deciding to not tell your wife about this choice.", "YTA for not telling your wife you were keeping her and your family a secret from your coworkers for so long.", "YTA but only because of your wife not knowing this. Your coworkers don't have the right to know about anything about you beyond what you choose to share, but keeping this from your wife wasn't a smart decision.", "Right in the middle on this one, cause yes I get not advertising your home life, there's no need to at work. I also get that shit might happen if you say something.\n\nBut at the same time, I would've been honest when people tried to set me up. That way they know why you're saying no and not to do it again.\n\nAnd I truly do get it, I'm a bi woman with a lesbian wife, so yeah, I totally get where you're coming from. I don't advertise at work but some people know because I'm not going to lie about something like that.", "NAH. Your wife has a point but you aren't required to be a standard bearer and setting lines between private and work life is a viable survival strategy. The situation, however, stinks.", "I get being afraid of being Out in that setting. Especially if you\u2019re in the states. But!!! \n\nYou\u2019ve worked there long enough that this should not have surprised your wife - so YTA for that. This should not have surprised her at all. Not come as a shock. This should have been discussed openly between the two of you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not sure specifically where you live, and in 2023, it's understandable that since the pride community has been so aggressively and unfairly attacked and targeted that it's OK you have felt the need to be protective.\n\nEspecially in schools! Teachers have lost their jobs or experience massive bigotry from parents and kids. \n\nLike, you cannot feel as safe and free as straight people.", "I can see where your wife is coming from but NTA as long as you never lied to her about being out. \n\nIf it\u2019s a religious school it\u2019s really important to be careful, they can be weird about such things. But then, we\u2019re apparently banning books now, so being a teacher is scary just in general. \n\nThat said, what happens if the kids get sick? If your wife gets sick? One day you will likely have to tell someone at work that you have a family thing. It\u2019s worth considering. You don\u2019t have to make a big deal of it, but it\u2019s going to come up.", "NTA for wanting to have kept it private in the past, because there are so many potential repercussions. Depending where you are, you could lose your job. And harassment (physical and otherwise) is a legit concern.\n\nBut. When you have children, isn't this going to be hard to do, going forward, as they get older? Seems to me it's going to be increasingly impractical to not be out. And if someone else finds out, and decides to out you first, you lose the chance to define the narrative. \n\nI think you'll have to bite the bullet and come out.", "YTA for not telling her about this a long time ago. However, I totally relate to the reasons why. Things are becoming more hostile out there for our community.", "NTA  Your coworkers do not need to know your personal life. For one thing, you don't know how they will react. Is it really  idea for any kid to go to school where a parent works? Other kids think they might be getting special treatment.", "YTA I get not getting friendly with coworkers - I don\u2019t engage much beyond professional- but you\u2019re going above and beyond and it\u2019ll be detrimental to your children.", "YTA. It's unreasonable.  Enroll them and treat it as it is, no big deal. If anyone asks just say \"Oh, I didn't tell you? I'm sure I did. Huh. no big deal, right?\"", "You're NTA for not telling your coworkers about your private life. They aren't entitled to know whether you're married, have kids, are gay or straight or whatever. This is doubly true because you work for a private school and those are typically religious, conservative, and bigoted toward the LGBT+ community.\n\nYTA for not telling your wife from the get-go that you weren't going to mention that your marital and familial status to your coworkers. Because that can very easily come across as trying to hide her, stay closeted, etc.\n\nI'm a private person. I don't tell my coworkers my business or life story. I'm also single. If I started dating someone and didn't want my coworkers to know for some reason, I'd mention it to my partner so they weren't surprised down the road and thought it was a reflection on them.", "YTA\n\nI understand your fears, but I strongly believe there is nothing more important to be true to your family and to be proud and thankful for having them.\n\nSo don\u2019t hide them from the others. Be proud of them.", "NAH. \n\nFind a teacher friend you really connect with and trust and come out to them first as a test run.", "You know what? NTA, and I say this because I (a \"B\" in the LBGT community) live in FL and it's not pleasant and often dangerous for the LGBT community here.

Actually, I don't think you're hiding it, but you're choosing to keep your private life and your career separate. All it would take to ruin your career is for a small group of parents to say that they are 'fearful of any LGBQTIA+ rhetoric that you would expose their children to' and you'll find yourself ostracized to an insane degree that would see you having to leave your current school (especially if you live in a 'red' state) and eventually see you drummed out of the profession altogether.\n\nShould you have the ability to share your life as much or as little as you want without fear of reprisal?

You are the foremost expert on who you come out to and how much of your personal life you share with your coworkers.   \n\n\nThat said, I do think this is a conversation you shouldve had with your partner like...4 years and one month ago, or like 28 months ago.", "ZazaZ", "YTA \n\nI'm assuming your child is around 5 or 6 since that is when a lot of kids start school. So you kept this secret from your wife for around 5 years??? Obviously she's going to be upset. You should have told her and not waited years before saying this.", "Do you wear a wedding ring?  That should stop them from trying to set you up.", "I mean I don\u2019t tell everyone I work with I have a wife and kids. I\u2019m 27M. But I also try to keep my personal life out of my work life. Granted I work construction so there\u2019s not much time to chit chat about life while on a job site but NTA in my book. Although your wife does have a right to feel the way she does.", "YTA.\n\nYou are entitled to privacy.  Your wife also has a right to know that she is being kept as a secret from people you spend 1/3 of your life with.   There is \"I don't share a lot at work\", but you went beyond that to actively hiding your partner.   I get why she would be upset.\n\nAlso, do you consider any of your coworkers \"friends\"?  I don't just mean work friends that you get coffee with, but do any of them tell you things about their life and have an expectation that you are sharing things about your life?  Because if I worked with someone for 8 years, and they knew things about me, and I was grabbing after work drinks, and hanging with them at holiday parties, etc.  And I found out they hid a whole ass family from me, I'd question our relationship.  There is being private, and there is actively hiding things.  You did the latter.\n\nIt's your choice, but you don't get to control how other people feel about it.  And if they are upset, you need to accept that.\n\nETA:  the 2nd part about the coworkers isn't really contributing to the YTA answer from me, its more about keeping this from the wife.  But, I think the coworkers, if any of them felt close to her, would have a right to feel misled as well.", "This is hard but I\u2019m going to say ESH. Your wife has such a strong point and has every right to feel anger that you are hiding her and the children. You really should have discussed this prior to getting married and having kids, you messed up big! On the other hand, does she not realize your job is in serious danger because of it being a private school. You have no protection, and most likely will be fired on the spot. It only takes one parent who doesn\u2019t agree with your \u201clifestyle\u201d gathers people with pitchforks to tell the principal/dean they think you are going to indoctrinate their child to be gay? Private school= parents pay tuition, they threaten to pull their kid= $$ loss. Then what? Time for a sit down and work this out.", "> I think it is possible I will be ostracized by my coworker and the parents of my students.\n\nINFO. How reasonable is this concern? \n\nIf you live somewhere where that is a likely possibility, then you are taking appropriate precautions, but also you should move somewhere less insanely bigoted. And you definitely should not have hidden what you're doing from your wife. \n\nIf you *don't* live somewhere where this a likely possibility, then yeah, you're just...being closeted and hiding *that* from your wife.", "Dude you\u2019re doing a good job to keep your personal life and work SEPARATE. \n\nToo many ppl share way too much and get burned for it. And making their lives much more complicated.\n\nSame thing on Facebook you share too much and malicious ppl will go on the hunt to find anything to use against you and cost you your job. Potentially. So ya you\u2019re wise to keep to yourself there no real obligation to share your personal life with coworkers.", "Tell me you live down south without telling me you live down south, lol.", "Well, if OP is in Florida, she could be fired for simply mentioning the existence of her wife, so I can understand her desire to keep her personal life private.  NAH", "If the result of her actions are the same as if she was discriminating against LGBT people, then she is just continuing to support anti-LGBT rhetoric by omission.", "There is absolutely no reason for her to not inform her wife what she was doing.", "Yeah, and the fact the coworkers are trying to set OP up with men\u2026 the post doesn\u2019t make it sound like that\u2019s a one time thing. If you don\u2019t want to be out, that\u2019s fine (but your wife should know) and you can shut down the matchmaking coworkers by saying \u201cI\u2019m married\u201d and when the push say \u201cI prefer to keep my personal life separate from work\u201d", "I would absolutely have gone with N A H had OP had this discussion with her wife a long time ago. Teachers are notoriously under extra and often face reactionary scrutiny for their personal lives, unfairly so. Private schools moreso, with not even a union to protect OP's job. *However*, OP has presumably dated, married, and had children with her wife with this never coming up...? Who is OP's emergency contact? What if something had happened with her daughters and her wife needed to get a hold of her? Or they simply ran into one of her co-workers outside of work? We still live in a world where lesbian and generally queer parents in particular face extra scrutiny due to homophobic paranoia around children, so I absolutely understand OP's caution, but I absolutely do understand or empathize with how she hid this from her own wife and jeopardized their family by deliberately not telling her.", "I 100% agree with this assessment. \n\nI\u2019ll also add that so far as coming out is concerned, there was someone last year who had posted about how she hid that she had a baby during covid and how to now tell her coworkers/boss, and the advice was to casually throw in a \u2018yeah my baby did blah blah blah\u2019 and if someone acted surprised to gaslight them and be like \u2018what, you didn\u2019t know I had a baby? I definitely told you!\u2019. This would be a pretty solid strategy imo.", "Yeah, this is the correct response. It\u2019s one thing to (understandably) lie about this for self-protection; it\u2019s another to also hide the fact that you\u2019re lying from your spouse. You also made it harder for yourself, because you could have been less alone in this situation. I wonder if you have other stuff you hide from your spouse, or if you are hyper-independent.", "I agree, I made a comment and didn\u2019t put this, but 100% should have been a discussion before dropping it on her several years later.", "Oh that\u2019s a great point she could have talked to her wife about it up front", "That's where secrecy gets us  --  not being open even with people we love.", "Do you know how easily OP could have lost her job if she came out?", "Did you not hear about the \"religious freedom\" laws several states have passed lately? These laws *allow* for discrimination based on sexual preferences. If OP does live in one of these states, she could be fired just for being a lesbian with no legal recourse. \n\nIf OP does not live in a state with these laws, then she would have to prove she was fired/retaliated against because of her sexuality. FYI, discrimination lawsuits are very often hard to prove, and they can be very expensive and time-consuming.\n\nAlso \"do the right thing?\" I wouldn't consider possibly putting my family at risk of harassment or worse the right thing to do. \n\nOP is NTA for keeping her personal life out of her job. (That's actually a very smart thing to do, for the very simple reason that your personal life *can* and very well could be used against you at work. Don't ask how I know.)", "I agree with what you say, except your last sentence.  There are plenty of LGBT+ who feel safe and free, just like straight people.  They are very conscious of where they choose to live and also kept a mental attitude of *being* free.", "Please don't pretend that bigotry no longer exists for OP's community. It's a massive problem in several states right now. OP's coworkers *could* be tolerant, but they could also be extremely intolerant towards her community.", "Regardless of the state one lives in, it is *always* best to keep ones' personal life out of their workplace.", "Im LGBT and just got a job at a Catholic school. It\u2019s literally in my contract that I can\u2019t be openly LGBT or openly support LGBT anything", "This was my thought too. Majority of private schools in America are religious based and have strict policies about who they'll hire. It's absolute bullshit, but it happens. OP could easily lose her job. Even if it's not a religious private school, if enough parents have a problem with OP's sexual orientation, she could be fired anyway.", ">OP is not a horse\n\nNow I want to know what the typo was lol", "Sorta, but the thing is you have to be able to prove it. Unless they actually say to your face \"I'm firing you because you're a [homophobic slur]\" that can be pretty difficult to do.", "Only for small employers (<15) who are exempt from these protections in general. As of 2020, the protections of the Civil Rights Act are extended to LGBT individuals. States can't overrule that. Not saying it doesn't happen but it's not legal.", "It isn't legal anywhere in the US because there are federal protections. State laws can't override that", "I'd also add that the wife should also know about this as a financial issue. She was under the impression that OP was out and that the school community was completely accepting. It seems that it's *not* the case that OP is sure she will maintain her job if outed. \n\nThe reality is that any of could be outed against our will at any time, no matter how hard we try to control it. In that case, OP's job might be in danger. OP's wife deserves to know that her partner's job could in theory be lost in the future, since they are raising a family using this income. \n\nI completely understand why OP isn't out at school. But her wife deserves to know.", "What laws have been passed making it easier to fire members of the gay community and in what states?  I'm surprised to hear this, considering the Supreme Court ruled in June of 2020 that firing anyone due to their sexual or gender identity is discrimination that violates federal law. Their ruling literally states that LGBTQ people are \"protected from employment discrimination from coast to coast, including in states and cities that have no express protection for LGBTQ people in their own laws\". Source: ACLU website \n\nIf you're referring to religious schools, they have the right to hire employees that share their beliefs and teachings. People may disagree with those beliefs and teachings (I do), but they still have the right to not employee people that have identities that directly contradict those beliefs.", "She doesn't have to go into details.", "Sorry you misunderstood my comment. \n\n\"You\" - in my last sentence - was directed to OP. Clearly, OP doesn't your narrative of \"plenty of LGBT+ who feel safe.\" Because they have indicated they don't.", "Yes, this exactly! Fired, being forced back into the closed by staff, harassed both in person and online - it's dangerous to be out of the closet right now, especially within school settings. There are tons and tons of examples of these things happening to LGBT teachers.", "I'm so sorry. Were there no other jobs available? I would have really, really had to be desperate to take a job with those caveats.", "That\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry", "Hay couples instead of gay couples lol", "*Hay,* that's asking a lot.", "There is religious exemption to Bostock though, so if it\u2019s a private school OP can absolutely be *legally* fired. Some state laws are more nuanced and prevent this, others aren\u2019t or don\u2019t exist at all.", "You\u2019d think it would be easier to do that. And yet some people just can\u2019t get over the hate the have for other people and it just sucks:(", "Conservatives realized it improves voter turn out to hate the lgbtq community", "First, there are places is the US that are safe for LGBT+ folk, so let's not give the haters more power in our minds than they really have.  I appreciate you seeing the injustice done to LGBT+ and being a supporter, but living an authentic life in this world, no matter what sexuality or gender we are, takes courage.\n\nLGBT+ have only gained strength and acceptance since coming out of the closet.  People can see that we are grandmothers, teachers, parents, athletes, etc.  I recommend OP find a safe place to live (New England and the West Coast are as safe as it gets for *anybody)* and be a family, openly.  Her marriage will be healthier, and her children can live without shame.  I've been out since the 70's, so while I  live in a safe, accepting state, I really *know* what it was like way back when.  Let's not go back to living like that as a society.", "Are they in the USA?", "I know a teacher, and she told me about another woman who was fired months before she got tenure because a picture of her having champagne with friends on New Year's Eve went out on the internet, and she was let go. They just didn't tell her until she finished the year. Bastards.", "People should just stay in their lane and worry about themselves.", "I am so sick and tired of those racists cultists!!"]}
