I already had 3 kids from a previous marriage and I didn\u2019t want anymore, and he adopted mine. He wanted a child and my love for him made me want one with him, so we started trying. For about 9 months we had back to back miscarriages/chemical pregnancies- the longest we made it was 10 weeks. Because I had no rest between pregnancies and cycles, my hormones were crazy, my body was so broken down I was virtually bedridden, and I began developing other health problems simultaneously as a result, including syncope (fainting due to spontaneous low heart rate). Through all of this he was so supportive and loving and always made sure I was taken care of. Right after a 6th miscarriage/chem preg, I got pregnant with our son. I had HG, a hematoma, and was high risk. Back to back kidney stones, 8 months of severe morning sickness, constant hospitalizations, and an infection that nearly killed me later, he tells me he wants to push my scheduled c section date back 2 weeks so we can have the baby close to his birthday. Didn\u2019t matter, our baby was born premature via emergency c section. I had my tubes removed as well which made recovery especially difficult. I had a successful business I spent 10 years building that ultimately died due to my health through these pregnancies. Because of all this I ended up with horrible post partum depression as well. Fast forward, baby is 7 months old and I\u2019ve been almost fully recovered for about 3 months.\n\nHe tells me that in the last two years I\u2019ve given him nothing tangible besides my company and personality and contributed nothing to our marriage and \u201cmade no sacrifices\u201d, and the only thing he has to show for being married to me \u201cbesides great sex and enjoying my company\u201d are the kids. (I sought clarity, and he\u2019s specifically referring to the outcome of having the baby itself- the issue is what I went through to produce him rendered me incapable of doing anything but taking care of my body). In this time I still planned dates, trips, did his work for him while he was at the office many times, cooked as often as I could, designed and decorated our new home, and supported him while he went on multiple tours. \n\nI\u2019m utterly heartbroken. I had no idea he had so little respect and reverence for what women go through trying for babies and having them, and I\u2019m honestly disgusted and crushed. I cry all the time. I don\u2019t feel the same way about him at all. Had I known he didn\u2019t have any appreciation for what women experience in pregnancy and childbirth, I never would have married him, so I told him that. \n\nAm I the asshole for invalidating his feelings and taking it that far? He's always shown me he cares which is why this caught me off guard. Am I wrong for withdrawing because of how he felt behind his actions?", "created_utc": 1702438901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18h7oeg/aita_for_telling_my_husband_marrying_him_was_a/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m really confused what tangibles or contributions he expects out of marriage besides your company, personality, taking care of your home, cooking, great sex and children.

I can't believe he said you haven't made any sacrifices or that he wanted you to delay your c-section so that the baby could be born close to his birthday. I think you're right that he does not appreciate what women put their bodies through in order to give birth although the evidence seems to be right under his nose so I'm not sure how he missed it.", "Girl he is all up in here invalidating all the time you spent pregnancy, the destruction it caused on your body, your mental health and your business, and you're worries about invalidating his absolute disrespect of you? That's outrageous. NTA at all. I really hope that you are in some sort of therapy to work through all of this. I'm so sorry your husband is such as ass.", "Wow the hide of him. I wouldn't be able to look at him after saying something like that. How dare he not give value to what you have been through. Did you actually ask him what his expectations were/are? I'm not sure I could stay with someone who values me so little.", "NTA. He let you down and your feelings are valid.

Or do I suck it up and move on since we\u2019re done having kids anyway? I do agree with counseling. We\u2019re both in therapy individually so this couldn\u2019t hurt.", "I was wondering about that aspect. I\u2019m surprised at how firm he is on this stance honestly. \n\nAlso- We\u2019re both in therapy separately and have been for years just as general good practice. Marriage counseling is on the table for sure.", "Yeah, what more did he want? Money?", "NTA work isn't the word I have in mind. Honey. I am so sorry.", "This. ESH. You destroyed your family in your search to give this man a biological child. Your business is in ruins, your health was shot for years, and where were your kids in all this? Where were they while you were bedridden, hospitalized, depressed, and on and on?\n\nYou have so much to do to make it up to your kids. Forget your husband, make it up to your kids.", "I thought the same thing. Who puts the kids they have through this? She talks about losing her health and business. She doesn\u2019t even mention missing out on being present for the kids she already had.", "Your opinion is", "Kids do *not* benefit when their parents are in an unhappy relationship. They model their own future expectations on what they grow up with, and your children deserve so much better than to eventually settle for a partner who neither appreciates nor respects them. \n\nIt's worth looking up the sunk cost fallacy, where the more effort you've put into something, the more likely you are to stick with it, even though you know it's a failure. I think that's what's happening here. Cut your losses and cut him loose.", "Sometimes these things develop anew rather than lurk and then become latent. Maybe he succumbed to weakness in a tiring time. Maybe he\u2019s just an AH, blood and bone. Hope counseling can answer those and allow you to decide.", "No sucking up, this isn\u2019t just about the kids this is about a pattern of behavior in how he treats you.", ">We\u2019re both in therapy individually so this couldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nAbusers do use therapy as a crutch according to \"Why Does He Do That\", so it can be the wrong decision.\nNot saying he is an abuser, because there is not enough info but he is an asshole and therapy is not as clear cut a decision as people make it out to be.", "I know this will be an unpopular contribution, but... it's worth saying that [men can experience postpartum depression as well](https://www.unitypoint.org/news-and-articles/male-postpartum-depression--unitypoint-health#:~:text=1%20in%2010%20men%20experience,loss%20of%20interest%20and%20guilt) (although it's much rarer and the symptoms tend to be much different). \n\nI want to be clear, **I am not trying to excuse his words/actions in any way**. But the contradictions in his statements are puzzling. He's acknowledged that he enjoys your company, your personality, and your sex life, and appreciates the children you have brought into his life. What he's really critisizing is your lack of financial contributions while you were physically disabled due to continuous miscarriage/pregnancy complications. \n\nI'm not trying to reddit psychoanalyze your husband. But if he's *truly* \"always shown \\[you\\] that he cares\" in the past, and has never expressed any frustration/stress/anger over such things before... then that would make this a dramatic and sudden change in his outlook/personality, which could very well be indicative of a deeper psychological/medical issue.", "I think your reaction to his statement was completely valid. He doesn't get to invalidate the magnitude of your sacrifices to push blame for his own frustrations. He's allowed to feel upset. He might be feeling some caregiver fatigue or emotional burnout from how he's been supporting the family, but you would be a better judge on the validity of that. Sometimes that manifests in a lack of empathy or resentment. It isnt an excuse to be cruel. It sounds like you guys are at least trying to vocalize some issues and I hope the counseling leads to a better understanding on both sides.", "You are"]}
