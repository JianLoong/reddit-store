You are upset about this and you disagree with these actions.\n\nSo why is your wife going forward with these plans?  Why don't you and your daughter's feelings matter in this situation?  Why do they have final say in taking over this space that belongs to your daughter.  \n\nIf you let this happen - your daughter is never going to feel like \"coming home\" is coming home.

SD has not proven to be able to be responsible in caring for her OWN living space, she does not get to demand the space of others. \n\nWhen daughter has moved out completely into her own space as an adult, re-evaluate the situation later. Do the other steps take care of their living space much better than her? Offer THEM the room, on the basis of their ability to keep it clean consistently.

You guys are the adults who pay the bills make her clean her bathroom.  Wake her butt up early on Saturday's to clean her bathroom.

But family has to tend to everyone\u2019s needs. Your bio daughter got the benefit of the space (not only extra space but actual distance from everyone else) which makes sense for a teen. Why wouldn\u2019t you give that to your step kids in their own turn? \n\nComing home from college doesn\u2019t require her to have the same room.

I get your compaint but the rule in our house was aways that the oldest got the biggest room until they went away to college and the room got passed on the next oldest. The child living in the house full all year long should get priority over someone who is only using it during holidays and the summer vacation. This way all kids get time with the best bedroom. Your not displacing your daughter she will get your step-daughters old bedroom. A perk of being the oldest is you get the best bedroom, but the downside is you have to accept that the room passes when you go away to school. It is the way of the world, and it happened in my full blooded sibiling house and I'd imagine you would be less recitent to the idea and more pragmatic were they full sisters but because this is your step-daughter you are choosing to view it as her moving into your daughters territory rather then a time honoured tradition amongst sibilings.
