How on earth does your wife think rewarding her for being a slob is a good idea?", "NTA - Step-mom and step-sister are stepping in to \"erase\" traces of your daughter and her space in your home.  You are upset about this and you disagree with these actions.\n\nSo why is your wife going forward with these plans?  Why don't you and your daughter's feelings matter in this situation?  Why do they have final say in taking over this space that belongs to your daughter.  \n\nIf you let this happen - your daughter is never going to feel like \"coming home\" is coming home.  She's always and forever more going to feel like she's a guest in your home.    \n\n\nThis is just me, but I would die on this hill.

She's fine with the basement bathroom being a pigsty because guests won't see it. So rather than doing her job to make sure her child is actually responsible for her space, she's just gonna sweep the mess into the basement. \n\nSo yeah stand your ground on this.", "NTA\n\nIt seems your wife's entire basis for this argument is: I don't want to clean the bathroom, I don't want my daughter to clean it, I'd rather HIDE TEH FILTH in your daughter's room. Then she'll see how filthy the entire basement has become and not want to stay there any more.\n\nThis is bullshit. SD has not proven to be able to be responsible in caring for her OWN living space, she does not get to demand the space of others. \n\nWhen daughter has moved out completely into her own space as an adult, re-evaluate the situation later. Do the other steps take care of their living space much better than her? Offer THEM the room, on the basis of their ability to keep it clean consistently. Then maybe SD can take THEIR room?\n\nRecommending family therapy. Hopefully an impartial, unbiased opinion can help your wife start to see straight again.", "NTA provided college daughter plans to come home when given opportunity.

Especially if she lives in dorms and has to pack in and pack out every year. \n\nI\u2019d have a conversation about moving during the next summer. That way she has time come home to her secure/known space during her first year. Then, she can have time to move and set up her room the way she wants it.

I don\u2019t think her standards of clean are ridiculously high or anything.

Why should stepdaughter be rewarded for her messiness by getting to move to the preferred room?", "Fingers crossed for you, best of luck.", "NTA.  It's your daughter room. Does your  wife think your daughter won't come back home for holidays and breaks? I would maybe understand if this was an issue about space, but it isn't.  If the issue is that your stepdaughter won't keep her current bathroom clean than why reward her by giving her the basement if that is what she wants. You guys are the adults who pay the bills make her clean her bathroom.  Wake her butt up early on Saturday's to clean her bathroom.  If she won't clean her bathroom than she can't go hangout with friends.  These are the type of chores I had to do growing up. You don't get to hangout with friends or do anything fun until your chores are finished.", "And why did your daughter get the premium room over her stepsisters?", "Is your stepdaughter the only one of the kids who has to share her bathroom with everyone? Is she expected to keep her bathroom cleaner than the other kids because it is used by other people?", "ESH. You\u2019re both making unilateral decisions about something that is important to the other. Why not compromise? Say that step-daughter can move down there if she can prove she\u2019s able to take care of her current space for a year? \n\nI understand wanting to respect your bio daughters space. But family has to tend to everyone\u2019s needs. Your bio daughter got the benefit of the space (not only extra space but actual distance from everyone else) which makes sense for a teen. Why wouldn\u2019t you give that to your step kids in their own turn? \n\nComing home from college doesn\u2019t require her to have the same room. Bio daughter can help move rooms and handle her things. It\u2019d be a good chance to go through everything and clear away things she no longer wants. \n\nThe fact is bio daughter might not like this, but regardless, she\u2019s not there the majority of the year. And if she needs to move back for whatever reason, why does everyone else\u2019s life have to revolve around that? It\u2019s not like she won\u2019t have a room. A room that you\u2019re saying is good enough for your step kids. What kind of message does that send to them about favoritism?", "So I'm slightly leaning towards ESH (not the kids) with your wife as more assholish for not talking to you about this before ever mentioning it to the kids. \n\nBut if your wife says that she feels like the bathroom is the issue then I don't think it is fair to dismiss that concern, especially when she offered a compromise that gives you what you want: your daughter staying in the basement room in exchange for you occasionally cleaning a bathroom that you and guests use. \n\nAre there other compromises that would make you happy? For example:\n\nCould your stepdaughter use the basement bathroom for showering/teeth brushing without taking over the room? \n\nCould you change the storage in your stepdaughter's bathroom to make it more guest presentable?", "I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I said \u201cif\u201d", "Or teach the step daughter responsibility."]}
