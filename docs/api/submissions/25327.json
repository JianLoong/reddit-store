You are not a museum. Grandma is dead, the couches don't matter. Did you promise Grandma you'd look after them? If not, ditch them. \n\nWhen my grandpa passed away a lot of the family wanted to keep a lot of his stuff. At the time I had a big basement and they thought they would fill it up, I realized this could turn me into the family history curator and mean I'm lugging around stuff I don't care about. I acknowledge that his surprisingly extensive nail-trimmer kit was cool, but I don't need it. I told the family I'm not keeping random crap on their behalf. Everyone take what they want, I'll keep a bit more than others, but they can't just dump his stuff on me. \n\nThe exception is the Lee-Enfield, goose-call and hunting knife. My grandpa made me promise to never sell them or give them away, but keep them in the family. He was old-school, he felt like every family needs the ability to survive off the land. So I keep them.", "NTA. You live there now. It's your house. I wouldn't even put the couches in storage. Either your mom can take 'm herself, or you just get rid of it.", "NTA, I have my grandparents wedding gift furniture in my living room. I inherited them and I like them therefore I keep them. Other old furniture I've gotten rid of. Only keep them if you want them. The old couch I flat out refused, it was both ugly and uncomfortable. End of discussion.\n\nTell your mother that either she'll take them or you will sell/donate them.", "NTA it's your house. If she loves them so much give her the opportunity to put them in her house before you put them into storage. \n\nCould be she views it as a family home rather than yours since it was Grandma's first, maybe you need to have a talk about it.", "NTA. If the couches are that important to her, she can pay someone to come get them from you and deliver them to her. \n\nI understand how she feels but ultimately they\u2019re your property and if you want to replace them, it\u2019s your prerogative and yours alone. Again, if they\u2019re that important to her she should show it by shouldering the cost it would entail for her to have them herself.\n\nShe sounds like a hoarder who always has some sort of reason junk shouldn\u2019t be thrown away.", "NTA!\n\nResearch, find, and wrap them in the best type of couch preserver before storage. This will let your mom know that you care about the well being and preservation of whatever attachment she has to the furniture, while also getting them the hell out of your way to put up whatever you want instead.", "Your grandmother's house is not a shrine to forever preserve in her memory.

Then you might know if perhaps they are so structurally sound that reupholstering them might be a better option. Or if they're worth so much that you could just sell them.\n\nIt's pretty important that you don't sell to the person that gives you the value though and make it clear that you're looking for a valuation for insurance purposes or something."]}
