Boyfriend currently pays nothing. No rent, car, food, etc. I\u2019ve been the sole earned for more than a year. I\u2019m definitely not in the financial place and am begging him to find employment anywhere at this point. The excuse was I don\u2019t have a degree first, then I don\u2019t have resume after I pointed out other ways to be successful. So I made a resume for him. He\u2019s actively applying for jobs (we have a joint email where I see application confirmations) but hasn\u2019t landed one yet. \n\nI asked several times for us to talk about it and establish expectations about the kids gaming. He declined saying this needs to be a man to man convo. The kid games 8am to 2am\u2026 DAILY\u2026 and has no responsibilities. Decent kid, good grade, but passive aggressive and downright sassy lately. Dad brings him food, sodas, etc. It\u2019s only been a week since they\u2019ve been with us. \n\nMy energy provider sends me weekly usage reports. Nothing else had changed. AC usage has been high since May when the weather reached 95. It\u2019s gone from about $200 peak summer heat to an estimated $350-400 with the gaming. I can\u2019t afford it. Period. I\u2019ve told him that. (We\u2019re getting Solar soon, but until it\u2019s installed, I\u2019ve got to pay for electricity) He still *tried* sneakily to allow his kid to game after I went to bed around 9:30 pm and I lost it when I left the room around 10pm for water. He accused me of trying to take away the one thing that makes his kid happy. He said I don\u2019t understand and literally put cash in my purse for paying the difference. (Then later took it back) I declined the money because it doesn\u2019t fix the problem AND he didn\u2019t talk to me first. My name is on the energy contract and I said if he has cash to share he should give it to contribute then he should just give it willingly for bills, period\u2026 not just now. He\u2019s offered to pay for things but truly can\u2019t be consistent in helping right now. He defied me again about the gaming and I told him to kick him off the game or leave. He left and accused me of kicking him and his kids out. He said he can\u2019t be in a place where he and his kids aren\u2019t allowed to be comfortable. (This has been my only ask) I asked about my financial discomfort and asked if it\u2019s more important than eating? cus we can\u2019t afford more bills. I only make about $55k and it just can\u2019t support 6 people. \n\nHe\u2019s painting a picture of me being a bitch for not baking down and taking the cash to toward the bill (again he also took it back) It was a few twenties and if a week causes the estimate to jump that high why would I endure a month or two and risk an even higher bill that I can\u2019t afford. He\u2019s also claiming streaming/gaming wouldn\u2019t cause a spike that large but nothing else has changed usage-wise.

You need to end this relationship and prioritize yourself.  You are providing for a household of people you have 0 obligations to and who have 0 respect for you.

He clearly isn\u2019t taking you seriously, even though he is allowing his kid to cost you hundreds of dollars. The amount of disrespect is startling and I\u2019d seriously reconsider this entire relationship- this is over gaming, but what happens when a car breaks down or someone has thousands of dollars in medical bills? He\u2019s absolutely comfortable letting you carry him- stop allowing him to use you.", "ESH. \n\nIt's not a binary thing, this gamingm instead of all out no, you could comprimise by letting him game a few hours each day. \n\nBut you say nothing else has changed, and that isn't true. More people will always lead to increased electricity useage. More washing and drying machine runs. More dishes to wash. Fridge and freezer opening and closing more. Ac working harder. More tv being watched. \n\nThere are little devices that can measure how much electricity is used. You plug them in a socket and and then plug the machine into them. \n\nBuy a couple and check how much each set of devices uses. \n\nAnd discuss finances with your partner not from a place of accusation, but create a budget and figure out how to pay for everything.
