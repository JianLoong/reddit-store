My daughter has been diagnosed with ADHD and currently attends a private school on a scholarship. She met a friend there who also has ADHD, let's call her Leslie. \n\nI picked her up for the day a few weeks ago to have a girl's day. She complained a lot about how hard her parents are on her and how much she cries because of it. I tried to empathize without judging either side. Later, I brought them back to my house and as soon as we got home, my daughter took out the trash. Leslie said, \"my parents NEVER make me do that.\" I just said that I understand and we have our own system here that works. Then she saw the chore board we have for our daughter and she was horrified. \n\nEvery day of the week (minus weekends) my daughter has three chores per day. It is usually one lengthy chore with two easy ones. Like do the dishes, wipe the counters, take out the trash. It usually takes 30-60 minutes to complete. Then at the end of the week she gets $20. Sometimes she might not want to do dishes so I will do them that day and she can pick a different chore. If she ends up doing more than we asked, she gets double. We write them on the board because with her adhd she has a hard time remembering. But she is going to be an adult in 4 years and I need to be sure that she can manage household responsibilities on her own. I still do the bulk of the housework but her chores really help me out. My son has chores too, but it's usually small things like picking up his toys, and he gets $5 at the end of the week since he doesn't do nearly as much as her. \n\nLater that day, her mother called me and told me how uncalled for it is that I have my developmentally disabled daughter doing so many chores and that I was working her to death. I just responded that I feel like I'm doing the right thing by making sure she can keep up with her responsibilities and take care of herself because I won't always be around. And she doesn't have to do chores, but she must if she wants an allowance. I asked some friends and they mostly seem divided. My family supports my current system. I asked my daughter how she felt and she said that sometimes she doesn't feel like doing chores but she likes getting an allowance and wants to keep the current system.", "created_utc": 1670880058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkbvwg/aita_for_working_my_teenage_child_to_death_with/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that she even gets a say in what chores she does is pretty awesome beyond that. \n\nYour daughter's friend is likely to grow up EXTREMELY entitled", "NTA - Check out the difference in 5  years between your daughter and hers, and then you can sit back a relax knowing that you better prepared your daughter for the real world.", "NTA.  Let's rephrase the story.  My daughters friends interfering mother called me to tell me she doesn't like how I raise my kids.  I checked in with everyone and they are fine so no need to change anything.  AITA?\n\nThis other woman should get her nose out of other peoples business - just because she is raising a lazy entitled kid doesn't mean everyone else has to.", "NTA. But that mom calling you and butting into your lives is TA big time.  What business is it of hers? BTW, as someone with ADHD, I've never been called development disabled and never heard it called that before. Learning challenged, yes. Disabled, no.  But maybe it's called that nowadays, idk. But either way, your daughter is functioning just fine with your list and her allowance, and good for you to help prepare her for adulthood. She's going to be a step ahead if she's already used to using lists to remember.", "NTA.  That doesn't sound like too many chores.  You also let her switch chores sometimes if she wants to.  It sounds like this friend is being raised to have no (or very few) life skills.  I think you're doing great honestly.", "NTA, you aren't treating her like Cinderella.  She has chores, just like everyone else in the house does.  She earns money and learns some life skills as well.  Oh the horror!  She might be able to not burn spaghetti when she goes out on her own!", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re offering compromises and don\u2018t punish her, but rather do something nice when she does it.\n\nSo she doesn\u2019t lose anything \u2014 she can only win.", "NTA.  You are teaching your daughter how to be responsible within the confines of her ADHD.  This is a skill that she will eventually have to learn.  You are there to guide her through it.  This is called 'Parenting'.  You are teaching her that ADHD does not define her and who she is.  You are teaching her that despite this disability, she can still lead a normal life and take care of herself.  You are NTA, you are an amazing mother.  You are doing what works for you and your family, what is best for your daughter, and she agrees.  Not feeling like doing chores is not an ADHD thing, it is a teenager thing.", "NTA-real life is hard.  The other girl cries over how hard her life is but doesn't do chores?  I would probably cut her involvement with the other girl.  Doesn't sound like the kind of friendship that would be good.  And, who the heck did the mother think she was calling you????  The gall of people!", "NTA. That mom is out of line.  My children (14, 16) do not have ADHD but have chores that are similar to what your daughter has. Do what works for your family and if you have concerns, take them up with whatever professionals are helping with the ADHD diagnosis for guidance. Some rando mom's opinion does not matter.", ">Later that day, her mother called me and told me how uncalled for it is that I have my developmentally disabled daughter doing so many chores and that I was working her to death. \n\nWow. That is super not her business.\n\n>I just responded that I feel like I'm doing the right thing by making sure she can keep up with her responsibilities and take care of herself because I won't always be around. \n\nYou're absolutely correct. But you had no obligation to justify your parenting to her.\n\nNTA and your system seems fair.", "NTA. That other lady is an AH for criticizing your parenting when there is no issue of neglect, abuse, etc. Also ADHD = \"developmentally disabled\"... come on. Mental illness is a disability, but it doesn't mean that when she moves out on her own she won't have dishes to do. Treating your daughter like she's incompetent would make things worse, not better.  It also sounds like you have some flexibility (choosing to do other chores, or to skip chores and opt out of the allowance), which seems to be working for everyone who is actually involved (i.e. your family, not this girl's nosy mom).", "NTA. i've had ADHD my whole life (diagnosed, but heavily untreated) and your system sounds fine, if not helpful to her adhd in the long run. you're teaching her quite well how to cope and manage her disability imo", "NTA. It's not like you're asking your daughter to clean the gutters, resurface the driveway or trim the shrubbery into a delightful topiary. You're asking her to perform age appropriate tasks, normal everyday tasks. \n\nNo feels like doing chores (I type this as I gaze at the dust on the TV stand) but  it's a part of life. And I think it's great that not only are you flexible enough to swap tasks on occasions, but that if she goes above and beyond, you compensate her for it. \n\nThe other girl's mom, needs to stay in her lane and MHOB.", "NTA \n\nYour system sounds perfectly fine.\n\nThe appropriate response to busybodies like this is to tell them that their opinion was not asked for and to keep it to themselves, before hanging up.", "NTA - there is nothing wrong with teaching your child to take care of herself and her home when she is older. You are not overloading her with chores", "NTA. It works for you and when you live in a house, you do the work in the house. If she's not having to stay up late to do homework, it's not a problem. Clearly she already has a social life. And you know that Leslie isn't happy with her home life anyways yet her mom is criticizing you? Chores are NORMAL. You aren't making her take care of the house on her own, she's putting in her share of work to maintain it. If you had her making dinner, vacuuming, dusting, cleaning the bathrooms, doing laundry, folding and putting away clothes, and cleaning the kitchen and dishes while you watched soap operas, sure. As it is? Leslie will be in college with no idea how to do her laundry or manage money, and then in an apartment as the loathed roommate who never cleans. And your kid will be ready to go as an adult and take on an adult level of chores.", "Oh, wow. NTA but Leslie's mom sure is. She needs to stay in her lane. Maybe if she taught her daughter some structure and respect, Leslie wouldn't cry to strangers about how much she dislikes her own parents. \n\nPlease do not change your system in the slightest. You are preparing your daughter for adult life in a very low impact way. These are all necessary life skills. Leslie's mom just wants to bring you down because she is embarrassed of herself in comparison.", "Your daughter has ADHD and this woman called her *developmentally disabled?*\n\nNTA and I admire your restraint.", "NTA and the mom with the child who has ADHD is very ableist. it\u2019s very difficult to stay organized when you have ADHD and it\u2019s great that she has a routine now and it will prepare her to be self-sufficient. every parent should have a form of this otherwise you\u2019ll end up with adults who can\u2019t cook or clean and will struggle outside of the house. adding rewards is a great system too because it will help her remember the feeling of rewards which is also hard for the ADHD brain. don\u2019t listen to them, and that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s also neurodivergent", "NTA. One day your daughter will live alone and she needs to know how to do the dishes and take out the trash\u2026 that\u2019s basic things we all need to do", "First of all, your daughter is neurodivergent, not developmentally disabled. Secondly, your household sounds organized and authoritative, not overly relaxed or rigid, which is something that my neurodivergent brain would have done really well with as a young teenager.", "NTA. Your daughter is learning to be responsible and how to earn money. The other mother is not teaching her child those lessons.", "NTA", "Ahhh *sigh*... NTA OP.\n\nI'm sorry that people \n1. Give unsolicited and very uncalled for opinion\n2. Think you're daughter difference absolves her from everything. \n\nYou sound like a terrific mother and those things IS CRUCIAL. SPECIALLY for her. Knowing how to organise and how to do chores will greatly help her when she'll be on her own.\n\nSomedays none wants to do chores. What we do? We do them anyways because we have to. That's simply life. And that's the way it's gonna be when she'll be out of your house. Keep doing your good parenting!", "NTA... Your daughter will be a functioning member of society. Her friend not so much.   It sounds like you are doing the right thing.  The other mom isn't encouraging  growth.   And did she use those words?    If she keeps saying that to her daughter well your DD you can't do that. It's not going to enable that child to grow up.", "I have ADHD, I had no idea until 23. Learning what ADHD actually is was a revelation to me because it explained so much about me growing up. I wasn't just a lazy asshole. I was an overwhelmed, disorganized kid with a rebellious attitude. ADHD is not, however, a developmental disability.\n\nNTA, you're already more than generous paying your daughter and giving her the option to forego chores if she doesn't feel like it. I had to drop whatever I was doing, even if I had friends over, to go do whatever I was told to do. Homework was the only excuse and even that didn't work everytime. I have to say this, it touched a nerve with me, CHORES ARE NOT CHILD ABUSE. I may not have wanted to do chores, but my parents didn't abuse me by having me do my fair share in the household.", "NTA \n\nBut\u2026.. this girl complained to her mum that you made your teenager do 3 chores for money and this woman phoned you to TELL YOU OFF ABOUT YOUR KID when your kid wasn\u2019t even complaining. \n\nHo ho ho! I would hang up on that woman so fast before I said things that would get me in trouble. \n\nWhat a nerve! \n\nNo, you have a good system. \n\nPlus your job is to train kids for adulthood!", "Nta, and is it just me or, while recognizing that adhd truly is a form of neuroatypicality and can be a severe disability, did it rub you wrong to have her qualify the reasoning as your daughter's being developmentally disabled? I'm curious if your daughter has been to her house and how she was recieved as this could either be fine, cottonwool, or quite patronizing?", "NTA, wow both the friend and her mother are incredibly out of line and need to learn to mind their own business.", "NTA. People are naturally lazy, myself included. It\u2019s easier to not do hard things. Good for you for teacher your kids early on that life isn\u2019t easy, and that you need to work hard to be rewarded.", "as long as your daughter doesn't mind the system, NTA. the setup you have for the system now seems completely fair. just because the friend's mom doesn't make her daughter do chores for an allowance doesn't mean that it's inhumane. ADHD is a learning disability, so it's super important to practice good & healthy habits (like doing the dishes, wiping the counters, and taking out the trash) so that it all becomes a part of her daily schedule. because the alternative is that things don't get done and the dirty dishes/trash overflows and she gets overwhelmed by how much there is to take care of. by taking it one day at a time, the chores are manageable and just part of her routine.", "An hour of chores a day? That's quite a bit, but at least you pay her. Can she choose to not do them and not get paid?", "I'm going with NTA, but an hour a day 5 nights a week seems like a lot - I don't think I could've managed that with extracurriculars + homework during high school and kept my sanity in check (I also have ADHD, but wasn't diagnosed until my mid-20s, so maybe she's just got better tools than I did at that age lol). \n\nThat said, if your daughter is doing fine in school and isn't complaining, I don't see why another parent felt the need to get involved. ADHD does not equal incapable. I'd just keep an eye out, it's easy to burn yourself out by accident at that age. But all seems perfectly reasonable to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even then, after I got into junior high my parents fell on hard times and I just stopped getting allowance", "Yeah \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d is absolutely the wrong term. While ADHD is a disability (under the ADA we\u2019re covered), something tells me that this mother was saying it in THAT way. \n\nYou know. That condescending way that people talk about those poor r-words I MEAN developmentally disabled people who need to be babied and coddled and oh don\u2019t you know they can\u2019t do ANYTHING for themselves\u2026. Lord forbid someone with ADHD have to do CHORES!!! The HORROR! As if OP expects her daughter to be self-sufficient and know how to clean a counter! Everyone knows people with ADHD can\u2019t do those things! /s\n\nThat really ticked me off.", "Especially 'Developmentally' - absolute misunderstanding of ADHD. Our minds arnt underdeveloped, we are wired differently from neurological people, and societies standards are geared towards them.", "Seriously.  I'm 42 and a walking shitshow without my Adderall but I'm not developmentally disabled. I've got a couple degrees, a great job, a spouse, a kid, a bunch of lists, a closet full of doom boxes, an Alexa in every room that nags me with constant reminders, a smart watch that beeps at me to do crap so I don't forget, a huge list of half finished projects and hobbies I loved until I didn't and a life I generally love. I'm not neurotypical but I'm for sure not developmentally disabled.", "And there's  bonus money for extra chores\nNTA", "exactly she can skip out on homework or miss a day of school to catch up on chores if needed", "Exactly! I wish that this is how chores worked in my house. I have ADHD and dishes are a nightmare. I wish growing up I had the option of skipping for a night", "*Especially* with ADHD, this kind of structure is so important. It will be a big help later to not have to struggle learning how to do these tasks which have become automatic.", "She did use those words. I don't ever use that type of terminology when speaking to my daughter about her adhd. In my opinion, she is very capable and responsible in general, not just in spite of the adhd. She just needs a little extra help in some areas.", "It did bother me, because it felt that she was saying that my child couldn't do these things because of her adhd. My daughter has been to her house and she previously said she was a joy to be around. \n\nI have a feeling she gets overwhelmed with Leslie. Last time I took her for the day, her mom said she was thankful for the break. Even Leslie told me she thought her parents were happy she was gone that day. It made me feel bad for her because I'd never send that kind of message to my child.", "She does not have to do chores if she does not want to. But she does have to do them if she wants an allowance. Depending upon the chores, the time varies. Some days are really quick. Like last Friday, she had dishes as a chore, but there were five dishes in the sink and we went out to eat so she only spent 10-15 minutes on chores that day. But usually it's 30-60 minutes. Some things, like folding her clothes, can be done while she watches TV.", "She does not have any homework at her current school. She manages to finish all of her work early and has worked ahead in most of her classes. We might have to reassess when she gets into high school because things may change. I do not want to overwhelm her.", "I may adopt one day when my oldest is an adult! :)", "As an ADHD woman who struggles hard with housework, I can confirm that you're setting your daughter up for success. Please don't change how you're doing things! I wish I had the same support growing up.", "Wait, what?  I hope you limbered up to make that stretch", "She doesn't have any homework at this school. She does all of her work at school and is ahead in all of her classes. She usually ends up having 1-2 hours of free time at school when she finishes her work to draw, play on her laptop or talk to her other friends who finish early.", "Hell I don't have ADHD and the structure helps me lol\n\nOP, NTA.  I always say people should learn how to function as best they can to their abilities.  And frankly nothing you've mention sounds outside the norm for the ages involved.", "I have ADHD, and your system sounds fine.  The other girl and her mother are wrong.", "Yeah, definitely NTA.", "That actually feels like a really relevant detail - very much NTA. She doesn't even have homework, these are her only responsibilities when she gets home."]}
