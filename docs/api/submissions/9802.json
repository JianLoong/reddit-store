Sounds like they have a clothing bias. As long as you're dressed in clean, comfortable clothes, decently suited to the situation and your needs, it doesn't matter what they want. You're pregnant and it entails a certain level of discomfort. If you can find a way to be comfortable then why should it matter? Also, your spouse is being unsupportive by attempting to bribe you. You already made your feelings known and it should end there. After all, it's just dinner. Why spend money solely to keep up appearances for others?! It should be for yourself.", "NTA - If husband wants you to stop wearing his clothes but you find them comfortable then just buy some mens clothes similar to them for yourself. Problem solved.", "NTA. You're making a smart financial choice, and if your husband doesn't care, I don't see why anyone else would. If you're going out to a ritzier place for dinner wearing sweatpants and a stained up t shirt, that might be a problem. But I'm assuming you're a normal adult and can figure when that wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nFor the record, I bought no maternity clothes with my second. I got bigger clothes and wore leggings and giant shirts at home.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is out of line. I just can't imagine the level of rudeness to tell one of my house guests that their attire is inappropriate (unless it was a racist t-shirt or something).

I get why you're doing it, makes financial sense actually. I get why he may be annoyed that his clothes are being used by you. He shouldn't have gotten his sister involved.

If you absolutely must, you could consider buying one (1) nice maternity shirt and wear that same exact shirt every single time you meet his family. They wanted suitable, well, that's suitable right there, isn't it?\n\nThat said, you are growing a whole entire person right now.

You're not a ah for wearing his clothes but the way you acted when you read the messages kind of reminds me of a tantrum. There needs to be a middle ground here so everyone is happy. Get some leggings and pretty tunics. They even have jeggings and maternity jeans that are comfortable. Get one or two dresses and that way at events or special dinners, no one is talking about the man's sweatpants and sweaters you're wearing. Wear them anytime except events and dinners.

I find Junior's cuts more likely to use XXL than swap to plus sizes like 2XL.\n\nFrustratingly, every brand also makes up their own sizes and scales things differently. So one label doesn't necessarily correspond to the same size in another brand or cut. So two clothing items that fit the same in a size 10 won't necessarily have the same size increase to the size 12 or same decrease to a size 8. Or you may have a size 8 that fits similarly to another brands size 12.\n\nAlso, if you're still reading, in the US the average size adult women is a 14, yet starting around sizes 16-18 a lot of stores and brands stop making clothes. It's a huge issue, because then only \"skinny\" people get options. It's also problematic that most models are single digit clothes sizes. It hurts self esteem and creates body image issues as well as not actually showing how clothes fit or drape on a huge part of the population. Even if 14 isn't the healthiest average, stores should still be catering to the larger half of the population and that they don't really design for half the people here is an issue."]}
