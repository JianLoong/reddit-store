You're pregnant and it entails a certain level of discomfort. If you can find a way to be comfortable then why should it matter? Also, your spouse is being unsupportive by attempting to bribe you. You already made your feelings known and it should end there. After all, it's just dinner. Why spend money solely to keep up appearances for others?! It should be for yourself.", "NTA - If husband wants you to stop wearing his clothes but you find them comfortable then just buy some mens clothes similar to them for yourself. Problem solved.", "NTA. You're making a smart financial choice, and if your husband doesn't care, I don't see why anyone else would. If you're going out to a ritzier place for dinner wearing sweatpants and a stained up t shirt, that might be a problem. But I'm assuming you're a normal adult and can figure when that wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nFor the record, I bought no maternity clothes with my second. I got bigger clothes and wore leggings and giant shirts at home.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is out of line. I just can't imagine the level of rudeness to tell one of my house guests that their attire is inappropriate (unless it was a racist t-shirt or something).

I get why you're doing it, makes financial sense actually. I get why he may be annoyed that his clothes are being used by you. He shouldn't have gotten his sister involved.

If you absolutely must, you could consider buying one (1) nice maternity shirt and wear that same exact shirt every single time you meet his family. They wanted suitable, well, that's suitable right there, isn't it?\n\nThat said, you are growing a whole entire person right now.

It\u2019s purely to piss her off so that in itself isn\u2019t a healthy way to think towards your family.

You'll get through these things together.\n\nAbout your sister in law.. she's an ass. First of all she's telling this to him instead of you, like wtf. At least say it to your face. And she's upset about you wearing male clothes? If you were in some classy establishment I could understand. But outside of that, what year does she think we live in? 1950?\n\nHonestly I would've shown her the door. but keeping the peace with your husband's family is kind of important.

And it was lovely and supportive of you to give your friend your maternity clothes :)", "NTA!!! I wore a lot of my hubby\u2019s clothes my last pregnancy, two reasons, financial and lack of availability to maternity clothes where we live. I even took over a coat I bought him for Christmas, no one batted and eye. I did purchase a couple maternity shirts and pants for the times I did need something more suitable. Do what works for you!
