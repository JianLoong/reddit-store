You're pregnant and it entails a certain level of discomfort. If you can find a way to be comfortable then why should it matter? Also, your spouse is being unsupportive by attempting to bribe you. You already made your feelings known and it should end there. After all, it's just dinner. Why spend money solely to keep up appearances for others?! It should be for yourself.", "NTA - If husband wants you to stop wearing his clothes but you find them comfortable then just buy some mens clothes similar to them for yourself. Problem solved.", "NTA. You're making a smart financial choice, and if your husband doesn't care, I don't see why anyone else would. If you're going out to a ritzier place for dinner wearing sweatpants and a stained up t shirt, that might be a problem. But I'm assuming you're a normal adult and can figure when that wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nFor the record, I bought no maternity clothes with my second. I got bigger clothes and wore leggings and giant shirts at home.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is out of line. I just can't imagine the level of rudeness to tell one of my house guests that their attire is inappropriate (unless it was a racist t-shirt or something).

I get why you're doing it, makes financial sense actually. I get why he may be annoyed that his clothes are being used by you. He shouldn't have gotten his sister involved.

If you absolutely must, you could consider buying one (1) nice maternity shirt and wear that same exact shirt every single time you meet his family. They wanted suitable, well, that's suitable right there, isn't it?\n\nThat said, you are growing a whole entire person right now.
