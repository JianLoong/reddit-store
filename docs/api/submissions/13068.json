My \u201cstep\u201d dad raised me and I\u2019ll fight ANYWHO who says he\u2019s NoT mY dAd because that man raised me and was there for me when my own mother/father were trash. We\u2019ve never used the word STEP in our relationship. I am his daughter. And I miss him so much every day. (He passed in 2017). \n\nMy bio dad started dating this woman around the time my dad passed and I had a giant hole in my heart and life that they decided to fill. And I was grieving and kinda let them\u2026 for awhile. \n\nThat was UNTIL bio dad \u201ctook\u201d over my dad\u2019s phone instead of me cancelling it because he had been on prepaid. He insisted on downgrading the plan to just local calling, proceeded in getting hundreds of dollars of long distance fees and tried to fight me over a gift card he felt owed because I gave him a phone. I didn\u2019t activate a new phone for him. I had a friend give me a brand new phone. And I gave it to bio dad. Bio dad felt entitled to the gift card that came when activating a phone. Like, okay. And the fight? Yeah he was in my face SCREAMING AT ME while drunk/high and would have hit me if I hadn\u2019t pushed him back from me (not aggressively\u2026 just a little nudge to back him the F up). I should mention that I\u2019m a 5\u20193 woman under 100 lbs (then 29) who can\u2019t use their one arm at all with debilitating pain. If he wanted to hit me, he could have caused damage. Well after I left with the phone, he told her \u201cI put my hands on him\u201d and she wanted to call the police. I dared her to because they were wasted and I had a sober witness to it as well as myself because sober, so like okay? Go for it. \n\nWell they didn\u2019t call the police but wonder why I went no contact with them by the following February and haven\u2019t spoken to them since. She shows up at my former work places demanding to know where I am these days but not only so these people don\u2019t know but they don\u2019t tell people they knew where harassing me while working there where I am if they did know. \n\nPoint of the story? NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO ANY KIND OF CLOSENESS TO YOU JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILY\u2026. My bio dad\u2019s girlfriend feels as though she\u2019s my step mother (I was turning 30 when we met\u2026) and my bio dad was the definition of a dead beat dad when I was growing up. He had a $50 support payment that was rarely paid. He now has to work under the table because they with garnish his wages for it and take all his income tax or anything. And I\u2019m 35. He has no drivers license because again he can\u2019t get that without paying the support he owes. He ALSO never showed up for visitation that was for like 4-5 hours during the day every other Saturday. I went no contact after a scary incident when I was 14 and my \u201cmother\u201d made me reinitiate contact when she wanted his money for a trip when I was 17. So I guess he contributed to that because she told him if he didn\u2019t step up, he\u2019d never hear from me again. Which probably wouldn\u2019t have been true\u2026  I went no contact again after aggressive behaviour in my late teens/early twenties and WE HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK INTO TOUCH when all this started. Why should I give them even an inch? \n\nI don\u2019t want to sound like a monster but if he died tomorrow, I\u2019d have zero regrets and only relief.
