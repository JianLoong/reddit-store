If they haven't completely ruined things, they may be, at best, in occasional dinner/outing territory. Maybe.

I do think if half sister feels like she's close enough to be included, the idea that you're not family might be one-sided on your part, though.

You have a long-standing relationship with your step sister and a strong connection with your step dad, and it's understandable that you would want to honor that bond. However, your comment about your half sister being just a \"sperm donor's daughter\" was harsh and unnecessary.\n\nIt's important to remember that blood relations aren't the only determining factor in who is considered family. You have the right to choose who you consider to be family and who you want to have close relationships with. That being said, it may be worth having a conversation with your half sister and bio father to explain your perspective and try to find a way to move forward. Ultimately, it's up to them to decide whether or not they can accept your decision.

It's your body and you are more than free to do with it as you please.

People are allowed to have opposing feelings without it canceling the other person's feeling out.

Also, she may not have any other siblings, and she may long for a closer relationship. So I can understand why she\u2019d feel a bit left out. But that doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong, and she needs to learn that just because you\u2019re related doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be close.

My sister kind of excuses the past for him so thats why i keep distance from her. Even my bio father doesnt excuse his past so its frustrating that she does.", "Well, duh, there is a reason OP grew up without his biodad participating.

Well done !", "That's all valid! It definitely explains some of the distance in your relationship. Regardless, if you don't want her name tattoo'd onto you, that alone is valid.

He left when i was 2 months old.", "yeah, we're saying the same things.

I'd your dad hadn't been a deadbeat, the two of you could have been close too.", "NTA for many reasons. First and foremost are the ones you mentioned, you\u2019re not close to them. That is all on your bio father for abandoning you as a small child! Once you met your bio half sister, your half sister could have made an effort to actually get to know you. She didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on her. And your sister is only your stepsister-not a stepsister to your half sister.

I wasn\u2019t close enough to warrant matching tattoos with Stepsister 2, and it wasn\u2019t even my relative who had passed \ud83d\ude02. \n\nI will tell you that over the last 10 years we are all now closer than we ever thought possible and got matching sister tattoos recently.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame you\u2019re getting this reaction from your family because it\u2019s removing the possibility for the relationship to grow into more than it is today.", "NTA, your (step) sister has been in your life for at least 15 years, you were friends first and then siblings later.
