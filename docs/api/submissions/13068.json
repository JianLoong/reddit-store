She can go pound sand.", "NTA\n\nMatching tattoos are between people who are extremely close and love each other very much. While not related by blood, you ARE siblings and best friends.\n\nI don't think what you told them was harsh, it's the truth and the sooner those two realize that biology doesn't make you family, being there does.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to get a tattoo with my half sister  either, if I were you. NTA, no reason to permanently alter your body just so some person you kinda know doesn\u2019t feel left out", "NTA, and it sounds like you were better off for not having known them honestly", "NTA, \nYou\u2019ve known your stepsister as your stepsister for 14 years, and grew up together, leant on eachother and were friends.\n\nYou\u2019ve known your half sister 4 years.", "NTA - You got a matching tattoo with your best friend.  Who just happens to also be your sister.  You don't feel that same connection with your half-sister.  While you hope that you can eventually forge that bond with her, it isn't currently that strong.", "NTA. They are a long, long way away from matching tattoo territory. If they haven't completely ruined things, they may be, at best, in occasional dinner/outing territory. Maybe. You don't get to skip the line all the way up to a matching tattoo, especially one involving another person's name (infamous for being one of the most covered up tattoo types of all time).\n\nETA: just saw in another comment that OP's bio dad and half-sister live on the other side of the country, so not even in occasional outing territory. They have a literal and figurative long way to go to build a relationship. I suggest half-sister starts by texting/calling every once in a while.", "NTA - it sounds like this is far bigger than a tattoo. I do think if half sister feels like she's close enough to be included, the idea that you're not family might be one-sided on your part, though. I can see how this would've put that in a different perspective for her and been jarring to realize, but it doesn't make her entitled to be part of this with you and your step-sister. I get the feeling there's a bigger reason why you don't feel connected to bio-dad and half-sis than just not seeing them that often.", "Considering she's virtually a stranger to you, it's kind of weird that she's getting weird about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nAfter all, you told them the truth. There is a family by blood and a family by choice, and it's obvious that your step-dad and stepsister are your family by choice.", "NTA!\nAre your dad and half sister under the impression that you are close to your half sister or do they think any sibling is entitled to a tattoo?", "You're not \"family\" just cause your dad shot genetic material at 2 different women.   \nNTA", "NTA - however the half-sister\u2019s reaction tells me she would absolutely be up for improving the relationship and (since you also voiced it here) maybe you could reach out to her individually and meet up more? Maybe it\u2019s worth it / maybe not but at least it might help in the future?", "NTA. You don\u2019t include people on matching tattoos unless you\u2019re wicked close\nTo them", "NTA at all- why anyone would expect to be included in matching tattoo with someone they barely know is beyond me. You're better off with out bio Dad and half sister in your life IMO. Especially if they're going to react this way over a tattoo that doesn't concern them in any way", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have a long-standing relationship with your step sister and a strong connection with your step dad, and it's understandable that you would want to honor that bond. However, your comment about your half sister being just a \"sperm donor's daughter\" was harsh and unnecessary.\n\nIt's important to remember that blood relations aren't the only determining factor in who is considered family. You have the right to choose who you consider to be family and who you want to have close relationships with. That being said, it may be worth having a conversation with your half sister and bio father to explain your perspective and try to find a way to move forward. Ultimately, it's up to them to decide whether or not they can accept your decision. So, in this situation, it's a bit of a gray area, but overall, you're not necessarily the asshole.", "NTA...why includ someone you dont know in getting matching tattoos", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI would get matching tattoos with my best friends from college before I got one with my full-blooded brother whom I grew up with, and I like him just fine\n\nBlood doesn't equal closeness, and your body, your choice", "You're NTA here, but I'm not sure they are either? It's your body and you are more than free to do with it as you please. But your half sister is also allowed to be hurt that you do not have a close relationship and feel closer with someone who isn't a blood relation. People are allowed to have opposing feelings without it canceling the other person's feeling out. They shouldn't have hounded you about it, but considering her age, I'd chalk it up to immaturity.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is young and still maturing. Also, she may not have any other siblings, and she may long for a closer relationship. So I can understand why she\u2019d feel a bit left out. But that doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong, and she needs to learn that just because you\u2019re related doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be close. Your dad on the other hand is an AH. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to read a Reddit post where people get along with their step parent/siblings. I\u2019m glad you have a good relationship with them.", "Yeah probably but my mum being the saint that she is encouraged me to give it a shot.", "Well bio dad was in and out of prison, abusive to my mum and an alcoholic. Mum was a homeless teen at the time when she was pregnant with me and bio dad was 23. Thats why i keep my distance from him, mum encouraged me to meet him when he reached out since she belives he has changed (mum is a fucking saint), i belive that to but i still keep that distance. My sister kind of excuses the past for him so thats why i keep distance from her. Even my bio father doesnt excuse his past so its frustrating that she does.", "Well, duh, there is a reason OP grew up without his biodad participating. If biodad wanted to get involved, he should have kept in contact when OP was 7.", "They live on the other side if the country so its not exactly doable. I go there once or twice a year and its not always to spend time with them since other family lives there too.", "Nothing stops your half sister getting the dame tattoo with both your names on it...but that doesn't mean you'll update yours lol", "Sounds like you have an awesome mum and step family! Well done !", "That's all valid! It definitely explains some of the distance in your relationship. Regardless, if you don't want her name tattoo'd onto you, that alone is valid. I think she will get over it, and obviously you have reason to feel that distance and it's fair that you shared that.", "For clarification he didnt leave when i was 7. He left when i was 2 months old.", "yeah, we're saying the same things. I'm just pointing that out, as you said, there's probably a reason they're not close which adds to this situation and the animosity.", "Meh ok .. well defo NTA .. and wish you well for the future"]}
