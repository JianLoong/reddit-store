My aunt  is over once to twice a month (max) to pickup and drive to doctor visits as I also work full time. It's important to note that my aunt and I have a tense relationship and we often clash. I would have gone no contact a long while ago if not for Grandma being a link between us. So I'll admit I am bias when it comes to situations with my aunt.\n\nLast time my aunt was over she took issue with what she says is a lack of cleaning standards. I keep a clean house for us, picked up during the week and deep cleans on weekends. I will admit it was messy but not unsanitary or unclean. \n\nInstead of talking to me about her concerns she decided to text my dad (her brother) that the house was \"disgusting \" And \" the toilet was covered in black mold\". Also, that \"she'd rather drive to the old gas station and to use the bathroom.\" My dad not wanting to be a middle man, in his words, just screenshot the texts and sent it to me. \n\nI was very upset, as I know there is no mold and that my aunt was blowing things out of proportion. I was also hurt that she's complaining and gossiping behind my back.\n\n I didn't call my aunt or say anything about the texts she sent dad. I just kept doing the daily routine. Except for the day I knew she was coming over again. On the next day she visited I had tapped a hazardous material warning sign to the inside lid of the toilet seat. So if she does decide to use the guest bath or checks up on things she would see it. That done I finished morning routine and went to work.\n\nWhelp.. surprise surprise, she checked and was very offended by the sign. Once again however she didn't message or call me. She messaged my dad who laughed at the situation thinking it was funny.\n\n As she didn't get the the response she wanted my aunt has finally reached out to me to tell me she was \"just concerned for healthy and safety\" and that I didn't need to \"mock her for caring\". I told her that I saw a full screenhot of her messages with my dad and what she said was not from a place of concern. I did not apologize despite the repeated amounts of times she asked for one. I don't feel a need to apologize. \n\nI know it was petty of me and passive aggressive but I don't think it makes me the a**hole.
