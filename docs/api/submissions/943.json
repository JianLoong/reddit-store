Fabric can be ordered, online.  Or bought at a fabric store.  Books that will explain every fabric out there, and what they can (or can't do with it).  Sewing is a talent, an art form, a craft to be learned and honed through effort and ambition!  Let them be envious.  Jealous.  Ticked off that you won't give in to their unfathomable demands.
