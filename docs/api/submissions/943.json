I told them that I was very busy and that the fabric wasn't available anymore (that's true). \n\nThey've become increasingly hostile and said, that I owe it to them, for burdening them with my depression.

Meds, exercise whatever. You gotta stick to the plan. But their bullshit about wanting free stuff because you were depressed? Bah!", "NTA. You could charge them as customers, but I suspect they would be AWFUL customers. Literally, who tries to shame someone into doing something for them based on mental health issues?

I guarantee that, even if you did make something for them, they'd be toxic about it.", "They are not your friends. You owe them nothing, as other commenters have already said.

They were never true friends to begin with and they are not true friends, now.  \n\nYou have depression......you are far from alone, my friend.  I have battled the condition since my late teens.  Has it affected relationships with people around me?  At times, I'm sure it has.  Like any other mental or physical health condition, it can often go beyond the person afflicted with it.  We ALL have something that we have little to no control over, and that includes your \"friends\".  Those who truly love and care about us support us in life just as we support them.  That is part of love for others.\n\nYou have made wonderful progress in getting to a better place in life!  Learning new skills and engaging in hobbies, and widening your circle of friends in the process is awesome!  You should be very proud of yourself!  I'm proud of you, because I know how hard it can be to turn depression around.  I also learned to sew over the years, and found so much joy in creating and designing wonderful articles of clothing or gifts for myself, my children, my family!  Happy for you to have found new interests as well!\n\nYour former friends?  Consider yourself fortunate, and leave them in the past, where they belong.  Stop contact, stop negative messages and ludicrous demands.  Close that door to the past, and never look back.  You have new interests, new friends, new acquaintances, and so much to look forward to.\n\nIf your old pals want nice dresses like you made, there are many online and other resources that they can use to teach themselves how to sew.  Fabric can be ordered, online.  Or bought at a fabric store.  Books that will explain every fabric out there, and what they can (or can't do with it).  Sewing is a talent, an art form, a craft to be learned and honed through effort and ambition!  Let them be envious.  Jealous.  Ticked off that you won't give in to their unfathomable demands.  And move on to the next fabulous creation that you shall create with pride!  You go and conquer the fashion world!!", "NTA... you should have given them you price us materials", "NTA\n\nGiven how atrociously they are behaving right now, I think you're probably being too hard on yourself by saying you were a 'bad friend' and a major reason why you guys drifted apart. \n\nYou need to block and cut these people out of your life completely. They know full well your mental health struggles and are taking advantage of it, fully in the knowledge that you probably feel guilty for how the friendship ended and think that if they keep on you'll give in. Decent people don't act like this towards strangers, let alone acquaintances.", "NTA tell those leeches to f*ck off!! You were depressed and a bad friend. They decided they didn't want to deal with you anymore. Both parties made decisions and moved on. Why do they get to reap benefits from your new found peace? If they want a dress so bad either 1. Find the fabric and quote a price for both the fabric and labor costs or 2. Tell them where to get the fabric and quote them on labor costs for the dress.", "NTA - seriously? You owe them for burdening them? Ridiculous. They have no right to your time and skill. \n\nI hope you draw a line to how they are allowed to affect you. (Either them stopping or if you find you can remove yourself from their verbal assault.)", "NTA. \n\nYou don't owe them a thing. You were depressed, and even if you were just a shitty friend without a health issue, you still don't owe them anything. Your friendship ended, and it doesn't matter why, because no one owes anyone friendship. They didn't like the friendship, the friendship is over. There isn't a debt to be paid from that outcome. \n\nI think you never had good friends, if this is how they act to you now. I have ditched friends in my life for a host of reasons, I would never reach out to any of them- even the one that stole my boyfriend- and say I am owed a dress. \n\nYou are not a human waste. But I am tempted to say these people are. Unless you injured them, stole from them, or kicked their pet, you did nothing to warrant this response from them. Block them and keep making cool stuff, you are doing great!", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe them anything.  They are acting entitled and using your depression as justification.  That's a bunch of baloney.  Depression sucks.  Unfortunately, the friendship didn't survive the depression.\n\nIf they really want the dress, offer to make it for whatever price you think time and materials are worth.  Don't undervalue your time!  They won't pay though.", "NTA. I think they were fine for initial ask but throwing your depression back at you with deeply shitty and I would throw a block at them", "NTA and please block them", "NTA this isn\u2019t a business if you do it for free so you\u2019re allowed to refuse service to anyone regardless of whether or not he\u2019s a protected class", "NTA.  They aren\u2019t your friends, they are just unsupportive assholes you used to know.", "NTA. If they weren't able to cope with being your friend through your depression, that's human - sad, sure, but everybody has their baggage and whether through time or personality or whatever, not everyone is equipped to take on someone else's mental health. But. It absolutely no way does that give them the right to feel entitled to your time and labour. They asked, you said no (in what sounds like a perfectly gracious manner), and that should absolutely be the end of it. They don't have a right to make you feel bad about it, and at this point are just treating you very poorly. (edited for typo)", "No. Oh hellll no. Friends don\u2019t weaponize your struggles and mental health in order to force you to do things for them. Not only is it a waste of your time and money, but if you make the dress then there\u2019s only two possible outcomes:\n\n1) They get what they want and go back to ghosting you.\n\n2) They have found your weak points and will easily extort you for future garments and they will keep you feeling down so they can control you.\n\nIf you noticed, none of those possibilities end with all of you suddenly becoming the best, happiest friends ever. That\u2019s because they\u2019re NOT your friends, as you stated and as they made it clear to you. A real friend will never harass you to the point of destroying your mental health. A real friend will NEVER see you as a burden.\n\nBlock all of them and don\u2019t give them a minute more of your time. Release that toxicity.

You\u2019re better off without them OP, congrats on finding a passion that you enjoy. NTA", "These people were never your friends. Blocks them and move forward with your life with people who make you feel you are worth something. Which is more than your old \"friends\" have ever done by the sounds of it.", "NTA, you owe them nothing.  You may have missed an opportunity,  though. If people are liking your dresses and you have time to make  them, there is a potential side gig here,  if you are inclined to take it. Just be sure and charge a price that is fair to you.", "You are absolutely NTA! They can suck it! You owe them nothing!

Also, I find joining with reading groups and other local library offerings of social events to help tremendously!\n\nFor me, depression and anxiety disorders are part of me, and how I'm wired.  They don't define us!  Over the years, various antidepressants and therapy have helped to keep them fairly well balanced, but it never truly goes away for some of us.

I see depression the same way, like a pattern that established itself at some point and that I need to actively break from time to time. It'll stay but it'll also get easier to manage, I'm sure.\n\nI taught most of my sewing skills myself from youtube really, and I had to help from my mum. I might pick up knitting at some point, because I'm so envious of those cozy sweaters you're talking about. For now I'm however focusing on sewing pants that finally fit properly :)\n\nThank you and I hope you have a a fantastic week!", "Those are some good points.
