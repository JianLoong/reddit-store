It isn\u2019t strange that I pick them up and take them out. I\u2019m pretty trusted with the kids so as long as I let their parents know, it\u2019s never a problem. \n\nThe issue: some of my siblings\u2019 kids behave better than others and I tend not to invite badly behaved kids. I\u2019m a one man band and I just don\u2019t have the time to keep saying the same things over and over and being talked back to and disrespected. \n\nYesterday, I decided to take the kids to a water park. I called a couple siblings and got the ok to take their kids. 6 kids total between the ages of 8 and 13. Ages are important here because it\u2019s important to me to bring kids that meet the height requirements for all the rides. If I take smaller kids, they\u2019d be relegated to the kiddie section making it impossible for me to keep an eye on the older ones. \n\nSo we go and it\u2019s great. All the kids got along and played well together. I get to the house and my sister in law was there talking to my other sister in law and was waiting for me to get back. \n\nShe asked why I don\u2019t ever call to take her kids (4M, 7M) out and I reminded her that I did. In April I took them to a splash pad and the 4yo was horrible. He was pushing kids out of the way, he bit a child, he hits both kids and adults, he slapped a plate of pizza out of my hand because he didn\u2019t want to take a break and eat. He curses, he spits, he pees himself on purpose. I could go on and on. I decided that I just wasn\u2019t taking him out again without one of his parents. I told them both this and they understood but hasn\u2019t been available to join us the last couple times I suggested something. \n\nI explained that behavior matters to me and is a deciding factor in who and how many I take out. Im told this isn\u2019t fair and I am picking favorites. I said \u201cmy favorites are the kids with manners who can behave\u201d. I was called intolerable and reminded that their son is 4 so \u201cof course he isn\u2019t going to be an angel\u201d. I agreed, but insisted I still have the right to choose who I can go out with. \n\nThe conversation didn\u2019t quite have an ending as it was almost 2 am and I was tired from a long ass day. Now this morning, I get a freakin Group FaceTime by the SIL from last night and a couple others wondering why I never take their kids out. \n\nI explained and it\u2019s now a war. They\u2019re pissed \u2018cause they insist I shouldn\u2019t have favorites and my brother said that he\u2019s going to reach out to my parents because it\u2019s unfair to punish their kids because they don\u2019t behave all the time.\n\nAnother thing mentioned was that I punish well behaved kids for the actions of their siblings. The 4 year old has a 7 year old brother who behaves. But I knew that if I asked to take one and not the other, it would raise hell so I invite neither. \n\nPlease tell me if I\u2019m the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1685897328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140iri6/aita_for_only_taking_my_well_behaved_nieces_and/", "score": 1103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I *do* understand their point though, that regardless of your reason, you are showing favoritism. That's hard for a kid. Why not do something low key with the kids who don't behave as well?

She\u2019s younger and still potty training and a bit of a flight risk, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable being responsible for her on a ship.

NTA.", "I get that. Of course, on reddit everyone loves clapbacks, but you do want to maintain a relationship with them.\n\nHowever, I think the way they ambushed you was unfair. I think making it a group call showed that their motivation was to frame you as the bad guy to others and pressure you, rather than to actually have a discussion and gain an understanding to the reason behind your decision. That alone would have burned all the future trips for that kid if I were you.\n\nAnd not clapping back didn't prevent a war from starting out anyway. Problem is, you're always playing defence against their assertions of \"favoritism\", when you, realistically, have nothing you need to defend. You've laid out your very reasonable explanation to why he wasn't invited.\n\nAnd on that point: why is it unfair to have favorites? They're not your kids, and your \"favoritism\" seems to be on the very reasonable criteria of whether that kid is a complete nightmare or not.\n\nLet's face it: on some level, they're just mad they can't offload their nightmare kid onto someone else for an afternoon. That kid's behavior is clearly more than just normal 4 year-old unruliness. They know it. Normal 4 year-olds don't weaponize urine or bite other kids.", "Maybe a compromise would be to do a low key outing (think movie?) but with the parents present. They can't deny that their kids have behavioral issues to work through, but as long as you're giving their kid equal attention as your well-behaved nieces and nephews, then they don't really have an argument about favoritism anymore. \n\nSounds like you're a good uncle either way, I hope it works out!", "Sounds like they just want free babysitting.

You\u2019ve given them options that include one of the parents being with you on outings, if that can\u2019t be arranged that is not your fault. No one could possibly have enough time to take them out individually and I\u2019d bet if you attempted a one on one outing with the 4 YO he\u2019d still be a jerk you don\u2019t want to spend time with. \n\nIt\u2019s up to parents to give their child manners.

And now everyone wants to involve your parents?  No wonder those kids are horribly behaved.  Look who their role models are.  As for the water park, you are right.  Taking the four year old changes the dynamic in many ways.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe sometimes invite the seven year old along.  If the parents say no without taking the four year old, say sorry.  That will not work for me.  And because if this, I will not ask again. Try taking the four year old out for a short event.  Maybe an hour or two, three tops.  Could be just to a playground.  Do not be afraid to be assertive.  Tell the child no when doing wrong and if they keep it up, you will leave. Say this is not how we behave.  He starts up again, you take him home and show him you mean business.  If you want to put in the effort, try this method two or three times.  The child will know you mean what you say and should start to listen to you.  But, if they continue as such, tell the parents you are done.  You have tried.

It'll give him a chance to earn the privilege of hanging out with you/ the cousins as well as teaching him basic manners that his parents are lacking to teach.

Ugh", "Exactly..would they let the 12 year old drive when 15 yo gets permit?", "K and when he never gets his turn for a trip? What do they tell him then?", "From my experience with my own son, I have to agree. He wouldn't have survived long enough to be diagnosed.", "Very possible. It just feels, as you said, like there\u2019s more going on here.", ">I would not jump to blaming the parents\u2026\n\nWhy not? Either it's bad parenting, or the four year old *does* have some disorder and they're just being willfully obtuse by continuing to push OP into trying to get them to take their child on outings. Sure, maybe they don't have the money or the waitlist for a diagnosis takes years, but they're actions with OP at least shows bad parenting.", "No, but it ruins the movie for everyone in the theater.  The kid can\u2019t behave at a splash pad. The movies is another place for them to act up.", "I think it\u2019s because the ODD isn\u2019t coming from an inherent hatred of authority, but from a lack of understanding and self control. As they get older they learn to logic these things out and self-control improves, which improves behavior and interaction with authority overall. At least, that\u2019s my theory.", "It's called \"lazy parenting\". Parents don't want to take the effort into keeping the younger one occupied, so they let the younger one tag along with the older one. Usually, both children end up resenting this, because the younger one feels left out of activities the older one does, and the older one feels restricted by the younger one and cannot freely enjoy whatever they are doing.\n\nIt's a super huge pet peeve of mine - if you can't be bothered to actually take care of your children actively, don't have them. It's much better having one kid and actively being a part of their lives, than having a handful and letting the older siblings manage the younger ones.", "My mistake. Thank you for correcting me.", "If they've made it clear that the trip is a reward for good behaviour and the kid gets to 7 and is still a holy terror then he gets told he doesn't get to go because of his behaviour. It really isn't complicated.", "The better question is - why do you think it's not okay for a four year old to be disappointed? Just because he may not fully understand and be a little sad doesn't mean he always gets what he wants. That's how we got here in the first place.", "That he would get to go too if he was a **good** boy.", "By all means, he doesn't have to take them to a movie. It was just an idea. The point is he should still be trying to do something with them with the parents present, so that he's not showing favoritism to his other nieces and nephews but frees him from the accountability for poor behavior.", "Very true! Though, as a parent, I\u2019ve noticed that my kids often prefer to play with each other than with me, lol!\n\nBut I don\u2019t make them; they have permission to lock their siblings out of their personal rooms whenever they want. And I think allowing them to not have to spend time together has actually encouraged them to play together more. Which I\u2019m super happy about and was an unexpected boon. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re close.", "If he behaves appropriately. I would not use expression good or bad boy.", "Exactly. If parents don't actively force them on to each other, kids will naturally form a bonding with their siblings due to proximity in age. However, when parents actively try pushing them towards each other, they naturally develop a resentment which hurts them in the long run.\n\nSpending time with siblings should always be a choice, and when it is, it naturally facilitates a closer bond between them."]}
