It isn\u2019t strange that I pick them up and take them out. I\u2019m pretty trusted with the kids so as long as I let their parents know, it\u2019s never a problem. \n\nThe issue: some of my siblings\u2019 kids behave better than others and I tend not to invite badly behaved kids. I\u2019m a one man band and I just don\u2019t have the time to keep saying the same things over and over and being talked back to and disrespected. \n\nYesterday, I decided to take the kids to a water park. I called a couple siblings and got the ok to take their kids. 6 kids total between the ages of 8 and 13. Ages are important here because it\u2019s important to me to bring kids that meet the height requirements for all the rides. If I take smaller kids, they\u2019d be relegated to the kiddie section making it impossible for me to keep an eye on the older ones. \n\nSo we go and it\u2019s great. All the kids got along and played well together. I get to the house and my sister in law was there talking to my other sister in law and was waiting for me to get back. \n\nShe asked why I don\u2019t ever call to take her kids (4M, 7M) out and I reminded her that I did. In April I took them to a splash pad and the 4yo was horrible. He was pushing kids out of the way, he bit a child, he hits both kids and adults, he slapped a plate of pizza out of my hand because he didn\u2019t want to take a break and eat. He curses, he spits, he pees himself on purpose. I could go on and on. I decided that I just wasn\u2019t taking him out again without one of his parents. I told them both this and they understood but hasn\u2019t been available to join us the last couple times I suggested something. \n\nI explained that behavior matters to me and is a deciding factor in who and how many I take out. Im told this isn\u2019t fair and I am picking favorites. I said \u201cmy favorites are the kids with manners who can behave\u201d. I was called intolerable and reminded that their son is 4 so \u201cof course he isn\u2019t going to be an angel\u201d. I agreed, but insisted I still have the right to choose who I can go out with. \n\nThe conversation didn\u2019t quite have an ending as it was almost 2 am and I was tired from a long ass day. Now this morning, I get a freakin Group FaceTime by the SIL from last night and a couple others wondering why I never take their kids out. \n\nI explained and it\u2019s now a war. They\u2019re pissed \u2018cause they insist I shouldn\u2019t have favorites and my brother said that he\u2019s going to reach out to my parents because it\u2019s unfair to punish their kids because they don\u2019t behave all the time.\n\nAnother thing mentioned was that I punish well behaved kids for the actions of their siblings. The 4 year old has a 7 year old brother who behaves. But I knew that if I asked to take one and not the other, it would raise hell so I invite neither. \n\nPlease tell me if I\u2019m the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1685897328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140iri6/aita_for_only_taking_my_well_behaved_nieces_and/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the 7 year old is mature enough, next time, ask to take the 7 year old along with the other 8-9 year old cousins.  Just flat refuse to take the 4 year old.

I *do* understand their point though, that regardless of your reason, you are showing favoritism. That's hard for a kid. Why not do something low key with the kids who don't behave as well?

How they have bombarded you & attacked makes them the AH here.", "NTA, but you definitely could have treated the situation better.

He quit his attitude *real* quick because he knows auntie doesn't play.", "NTA.

No one expects them to be perfect. If there are behavioral issues, all the more reason for parents to work with him and understand why you don\u2019t want to be responsible for him in a chaotic, public setting. \n\nBottom line folks, no one owes it to you to be understanding if your kid is acting like a jerk in public and you can\u2019t be bothered.

If they say no unless you take both,  that's on them.", "I hope he will reconsider that. It\u2019s not fair to the older sibling to be tethered to the younger like that (and vice versa). I\u2019m taking my nephew on a Disney cruise and not my niece. She\u2019s younger and still potty training and a bit of a flight risk, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable being responsible for her on a ship. Luckily, their parents realize the kids can have separate experiences and this is good for both of them to have that independence.", "Then your brother is the one punishing the 7 year old for his sibling\u2019s behavior, not you.", "It's implied by the fact of the child's violent behavior that they are deficient parents, and I think they are mad because they understand that implication. NTA.", "I get that. Of course, on reddit everyone loves clapbacks, but you do want to maintain a relationship with them.\n\nHowever, I think the way they ambushed you was unfair. I think making it a group call showed that their motivation was to frame you as the bad guy to others and pressure you, rather than to actually have a discussion and gain an understanding to the reason behind your decision. That alone would have burned all the future trips for that kid if I were you.\n\nAnd not clapping back didn't prevent a war from starting out anyway. Problem is, you're always playing defence against their assertions of \"favoritism\", when you, realistically, have nothing you need to defend. You've laid out your very reasonable explanation to why he wasn't invited.\n\nAnd on that point: why is it unfair to have favorites? They're not your kids, and your \"favoritism\" seems to be on the very reasonable criteria of whether that kid is a complete nightmare or not.\n\nLet's face it: on some level, they're just mad they can't offload their nightmare kid onto someone else for an afternoon. That kid's behavior is clearly more than just normal 4 year-old unruliness. They know it. Normal 4 year-olds don't weaponize urine or bite other kids.", "Maybe a compromise would be to do a low key outing (think movie?) but with the parents present. They can't deny that their kids have behavioral issues to work through, but as long as you're giving their kid equal attention as your well-behaved nieces and nephews, then they don't really have an argument about favoritism anymore. \n\nSounds like you're a good uncle either way, I hope it works out!", "Sounds like they just want free babysitting.
