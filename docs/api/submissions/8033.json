Ever since I started professional theater training two years ago, the comments have really ramped up. They usually have three things they comment on- my hair, my skin, and my weight. They know I\u2019m very proud of having very thick, black curly hair, so they often make comments about it being \u201cnot really black,\u201d and compare it unfavorably to my little sister\u2019s by saying hers is darker and \u201cless bushy.\u201d I also have a condition that makes my circulation very poor, so I\u2019m very pale, don\u2019t tan well, and have a lot of red in my skin tone, particularly my face, so it\u2019s a running \u201cjoke\u201d that I look like a vampire. The last one, and the one that does the most damage, is the comments on my weight. At my heaviest a year ago, I weighed around 133, but I\u2019m only 5\u20193\u201d, so it looked like more weight than it was. My older sister, who\u2019s very small and petite, describes me as \u201cheavy,\u201d and talks about how she wishes I could \u201cshare a few of my pounds\u201d with her.\n\nI decided earlier this year that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and after I got accepted to drama school, I committed to fixing the things I don\u2019t like about myself. I\u2019ve started taking care of my hair and learning how to use makeup to work with the red in my skin instead of against it. They didn\u2019t notice these changes, but they did notice when I started losing weight. I\u2019ve been calorie counting, and I\u2019ve lost six or seven pounds since the start of the year. \n\nLast night, after I refused a second bowl of pasta at a family dinner because I didn\u2019t have the calories for it, my mom commented on the fact that I\u2019d been losing weight, and asked why I felt like I needed to because I don\u2019t look bad the way I am. I was honest, and briefly described the last time I got called \u201cheavy\u201d by my sisters. I said that it really got to me and I wanted to make sure I really liked myself before I get to drama school, so that I\u2019m not battling as much insecurity while I\u2019m there. Everyone was kind of quiet afterwards, and my older sister left the table not long after and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Later that night my mom pulled me aside and said that I could do what I wanted with my body, but I shouldn\u2019t blame my sisters for the way I felt about myself. She said it had really hurt my sisters, particularly my older sister, that I had made them feel \u201cguilty\u201d about my choice to lose weight, and even if I\u2019m losing weight because of their comments, I should keep that to myself. My other two sisters have since told me that making my weight loss about them was inappropriate and asked me to apologize for \u201cputting that on them,\u201d because even if they did comment on my weight, they\u2019ve never told me I should lose any, so I have no right to try and make it their responsibility.

Do not lose weight because of insecurity alone.  There will ALWAYS be people who will find fault in the way you look or act.  If someone says there is a problem with you, listen, but decide for yourself if it is valid.  \n\nThere is a big difference between worth and value.  Your worth is the same as everyone else's.  It will never increase or decrease.  You are ALWAYS worthy of love and kindness.  Your value, however, will change from person to person, moment to moment.

Everyone is your equal.  \n\nIf you try to change yourself based on the opinion of others, regardless of its validity, then you will never stop, you will never be enough.

It's not starvation mode as people like to claim, rather, it's the body doing exactly what it's programmed to do from our early hunter/gatherer days to help us keep moving even when we can't find enough resources to support ourselves. \n\nAnyone who has actually tried to lose weight with a community has seen this in their forums before the research became more widely cited - People post they've been in a heavy diet for months and they get stuck in a plateau for a long time and can't get their numbers to move lower.

That's the recommended caloric intake of a 4-8 year old in the US, and 500 calories below their BMR.\n\nA more achievable and healthy weight loss rate would be between .5-1lb per week, which would put them between 2000-1750 calories per day.", "Sorry but consuming collagen does dick all for your skin or health", "What is collagen called?
