Ever since I started professional theater training two years ago, the comments have really ramped up. They usually have three things they comment on- my hair, my skin, and my weight. They know I\u2019m very proud of having very thick, black curly hair, so they often make comments about it being \u201cnot really black,\u201d and compare it unfavorably to my little sister\u2019s by saying hers is darker and \u201cless bushy.\u201d I also have a condition that makes my circulation very poor, so I\u2019m very pale, don\u2019t tan well, and have a lot of red in my skin tone, particularly my face, so it\u2019s a running \u201cjoke\u201d that I look like a vampire. The last one, and the one that does the most damage, is the comments on my weight. At my heaviest a year ago, I weighed around 133, but I\u2019m only 5\u20193\u201d, so it looked like more weight than it was. My older sister, who\u2019s very small and petite, describes me as \u201cheavy,\u201d and talks about how she wishes I could \u201cshare a few of my pounds\u201d with her.\n\nI decided earlier this year that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and after I got accepted to drama school, I committed to fixing the things I don\u2019t like about myself. I\u2019ve started taking care of my hair and learning how to use makeup to work with the red in my skin instead of against it. They didn\u2019t notice these changes, but they did notice when I started losing weight.

I was honest, and briefly described the last time I got called \u201cheavy\u201d by my sisters. I said that it really got to me and I wanted to make sure I really liked myself before I get to drama school, so that I\u2019m not battling as much insecurity while I\u2019m there. Everyone was kind of quiet afterwards, and my older sister left the table not long after and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Later that night my mom pulled me aside and said that I could do what I wanted with my body, but I shouldn\u2019t blame my sisters for the way I felt about myself. She said it had really hurt my sisters, particularly my older sister, that I had made them feel \u201cguilty\u201d about my choice to lose weight, and even if I\u2019m losing weight because of their comments, I should keep that to myself. My other two sisters have since told me that making my weight loss about them was inappropriate and asked me to apologize for \u201cputting that on them,\u201d because even if they did comment on my weight, they\u2019ve never told me I should lose any, so I have no right to try and make it their responsibility.

The first is a good, green-tinted primer.  The second is clay-based masks.  The third is hydrolized collagen protein powder.  I am a gramma now, and my husband tells me all the time how good my skin looks.  And it really does.  The powder is a godsend.  Plus, that collagen helps skin bounce back after weight loss.\n\nYou do you, and tell your mother and sisters that the feeling they have is shame, and it is their feeling to deal with:  you are not their emotional caregiver.", "That sounds like a really good attempt at boundary setting, especially for someone who is conflict avoidant! You should be proud of yourself for that. For the next time they say they're just offering their opinion or that they're allowed to have an opinion, you could try something like \"of course you're entitled to your opinion, just as I'm entitled to ask that you don't share your opinions about my body/appearance with me\"\n\nAnd the realization that you can't change other people and can only control yourself is a very mature one that not many people get to by the age of 20. Keep on doing what you're doing, OP!", "Don't apologize.  Instead ask for an apology from them for bullying you.\n\nNTA", "NTA tell them to wear the shoe that fits so well!", "NTA, but you're sisters are mom definitely are. I have two children, and I always try to make sure that they both treat each other with kindness. If one of them came to me and said the other one made a disparaging comment about their way or made them feel self-conscious about their weight, you can definitely know that I would approach that sibling to see what's going on. The fact that your mom felt the need to take you aside instead of your sister, speaks volumes to the type of parent she is. I'm very sorry that you have a far less than supporting mother. If I were you, I would direct her to this page so maybe she can see that what she did wasn't right, what your sisters did wasn't right, and that they owe you an apology, not the other way around. This is why people have issues with their weight, because those around them make nasty comments. Your sisters sound like jerks and your mom does too. The only reason they felt bad, is because they got embarrassed for being called out for their disgusting behavior towards you. And by the way, 133 pounds is perfectly fine for your height. I'm sure you look beautiful!", "They may not have directly told you to lose weight but they made you feel bad about it repeatedly. Your mother is wrong to scold you for that while she stood back and did nothing while your sisters bullied you. I bet even if you become thinner than them, they'll still attack your looks. They're assholes. And they're wrong. NTA", "NTA. They just don\u2019t want to admit they are bullies.", "NTA. Tell them this wouldn\u2019t have happened if they minded their own business in the first place! Do not apologize!!!", "So basically your mother said you shouldn't let your sisters know how the incredibly rude things they said to you hurt you, because letting everyone know how rude they were hurt their feelings.  Sorry, that's stupid.  And if that hurts her feelings,  too bad.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but your sisters are, as well as your mom for enabling them. Good luck in acting school, & congrats on the weight loss, if that is what YOU wanted!", "So NTA. But your mom and your sisters are.  I'm sorry that your mom didn't have your back. Hugs for you, op.", "NTA  The real solution was for them to apologize for their negativity and for your mother to not step in and make their feelings more valid then yours. And honestly wtg on losing the weight in a  healthy way.", "Nta you don't owe them anything. They feel guilty because they know they were wrong. Your mom sucks by enabling your bullies, I mean sisters. Tell them to shove it and keep moving. These people are toxic and deserve each other.", "Gosh I'm sorry you are going through this.  Family has been bullying you for years.  Will likely help in acting.  Forgive them and move on, can't change family, but you don't have to let them hurt you.  Water on a ducks back.  Their opinions are theirs.  NTA", "NTA. Your sisters should feel guilty. I'm willing to bet that they just don't like being called out on their behaviour. \n\nYour mom is just as bad. She probably either knew what was happening or felt she should have known. Either way, sounds like she's also trying to deflect blame, and try and put it on you. \n\nTheir behaviour is not your fault. No matter what weight you are or where you are in life you dont deserve to be treated like this. Ever. Go have a great time in acting school and make the most out of this new chapter in your life.", "NTA\n\nThey should feel remorse that their flippant comments had that impact on you. It's a valuable lesson for them to carry into other facets of their lives. \n\nIt's sad to read that your mother seemed more concerned with their wellbeing than yours. She's probably  projecting her own guilt.", "NTA. Look. your sisters have been making comments for years, of course it\u2019s hurt and impacted your perception of yourself. It\u2019s probably jealousy on their part. They sound awful. But regardless you have to do stuff for you. And it\u2019s ok to call a spade a spade. And you\u2019re not alone.\n\nYou\u2019re sufficient sis. And you sound healthy. Talk to your doctor before making any significant decisions about your weight please\u2026", "If people can\u2019t live with the truth of what they said, maybe they should watch out what they are saying?\n\nI know that feeling well, and it would be healthy to let go of the past. But sometimes a single event just engraves in you. And you can\u2019t decide why and if that happens.\n\nYou can have a talk with her and try to put it past, and also try to not bring it up forever.\n\nBut else NTA imo.", "NTA!\nFor someone who for years have been body shamed by my family (I have blocked them out), I wish I had told them sooner that they were the reason for my endless weightloss regime", "NTA", "NTA. Your sisters are though and your mom. They are being cruel and critical and your mom is essentially going along with it by not sayin anything to them. You take care of yourself and ignore them.", "This is all BS. 'I didn't actually say those very exact words, so you can't blame me for being a b\\*\\*\\*h.' Yeah, right. NTA.\n\nYou know what you heard and what tone of voice it was said in.\n\nI'm diagnosing jealousy on the part of the other two. Don't get sucked in by diet culture, though. Be healthy, but exercise is better than calorie counting for long term health.", "NTA\n\n1200kcal is NOT ENOUGH. Please stop starving yourself.\n\nRemember that great skin starts with skincare, not make-up. Makeup makes your skin look worse long-term.\n\nWhile it's good that you taught yourself the curly hair method for your hair, please stop punishing your body. It's good that you're committed to be a healthy weight, but crash diets is not the way. Losing almost 10lbs in a month is too much, cut that goal in half.\n\n\nI'd recommend going LC with your family, they sound like fucking assholes. Consider therapy to try and heal from the shit they put you through over the years.", "But they don\u2019t feel guilty, because if they did they would apologize.  They are angry that sis told mom and they look bad.  They only care about themselves.", "This. Do not, under any circumstances, apologize to them. You haven't done a thing wrong. If the truth about their actions makes them feel bad/guilty, that means they have done something that warrants feeling guilty about.", "As someone I used to know liked to say:\n\nDon't start none, won't be none.", "r/nothingeverhappens\n\nThere is nothing about this that is implausible at all, my guy. Families can suck. The only part that raises my eyebrows a little is that OP doesn\u2019t seem to realize she\u2019s not \u201cheavy\u201d at all. And even with that, short people do tend to have thicker builds, so she could easily look heavier than she actually is, and unfortunately a lot of eating disorders start with a distorted view of how big you really are. I don\u2019t see anything fake about this, just someone who\u2019s become very insecure because of the criticism she\u2019s received, whether or not that criticism is accurate.", "At your age, it\u2019s absolutely fine to lose weight at that rate.", "NTA at all. They want an apology from you for being hurt by their hurtful words. You deserve much better.", "It\u2019s the line of events and the outcome. Why would they ask for an apology on this? It\u2019s somewhat believable the mom would talk like that, but it\u2019s still a bit ridiculous with the information given. The details just seem completely off versus the normal dynamic of being bullied by siblings\n\nI need to add that ALL 3 felt this way. Like it\u2019s actually goofy as hell\n\nOh and one more thing. This person lost 6-7 pounds at that weight. That takes dedication in diet and there\u2019s no way her mom as the person who feeds her could not see this earlier.", "They\u2019re asking for an apology because they feel guilty. If OP apologizes, they get to go on pretending they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And it doesn\u2019t seem odd at all that all three would be doing this; OP has already mentioned being very conflict-avoidant, so if one sister starts picking on her and the other two learn that she won\u2019t stand up for herself, it\u2019s not at ALL impossible that the other two would join in on the bullying. Especially if, as I strongly suspect, OP is nowhere near as ugly as her sisters have painted her, and jealousy is the motivator here. An acting career is not easy work, and OP is already much farther along towards achieving that dream than most people will ever get. Envy could definitely be a factor.\n\nRegardless, if you think it\u2019s fake, just go read another post."]}
