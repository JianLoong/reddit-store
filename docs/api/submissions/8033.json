{"id": 8033, "submission_id": "10izv1p", "title": "AITA for being honest about why I\u2019m losing weight?", "selftext": "I (20F) have always had issues with my family, particularly my three sisters, making comments about my body, partially because I\u2019m going into a \u201clooks-based\u201d field, acting, even though I\u2019m probably not what would be considered conventionally attractive. Ever since I started professional theater training two years ago, the comments have really ramped up. They usually have three things they comment on- my hair, my skin, and my weight. They know I\u2019m very proud of having very thick, black curly hair, so they often make comments about it being \u201cnot really black,\u201d and compare it unfavorably to my little sister\u2019s by saying hers is darker and \u201cless bushy.\u201d I also have a condition that makes my circulation very poor, so I\u2019m very pale, don\u2019t tan well, and have a lot of red in my skin tone, particularly my face, so it\u2019s a running \u201cjoke\u201d that I look like a vampire. The last one, and the one that does the most damage, is the comments on my weight. At my heaviest a year ago, I weighed around 133, but I\u2019m only 5\u20193\u201d, so it looked like more weight than it was. My older sister, who\u2019s very small and petite, describes me as \u201cheavy,\u201d and talks about how she wishes I could \u201cshare a few of my pounds\u201d with her.\n\nI decided earlier this year that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and after I got accepted to drama school, I committed to fixing the things I don\u2019t like about myself. I\u2019ve started taking care of my hair and learning how to use makeup to work with the red in my skin instead of against it. They didn\u2019t notice these changes, but they did notice when I started losing weight. I\u2019ve been calorie counting, and I\u2019ve lost six or seven pounds since the start of the year. \n\nLast night, after I refused a second bowl of pasta at a family dinner because I didn\u2019t have the calories for it, my mom commented on the fact that I\u2019d been losing weight, and asked why I felt like I needed to because I don\u2019t look bad the way I am. I was honest, and briefly described the last time I got called \u201cheavy\u201d by my sisters. I said that it really got to me and I wanted to make sure I really liked myself before I get to drama school, so that I\u2019m not battling as much insecurity while I\u2019m there. Everyone was kind of quiet afterwards, and my older sister left the table not long after and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Later that night my mom pulled me aside and said that I could do what I wanted with my body, but I shouldn\u2019t blame my sisters for the way I felt about myself. She said it had really hurt my sisters, particularly my older sister, that I had made them feel \u201cguilty\u201d about my choice to lose weight, and even if I\u2019m losing weight because of their comments, I should keep that to myself. My other two sisters have since told me that making my weight loss about them was inappropriate and asked me to apologize for \u201cputting that on them,\u201d because even if they did comment on my weight, they\u2019ve never told me I should lose any, so I have no right to try and make it their responsibility.

I had a similar experience growing up- my dad would make veiled (and sometimes just rude) comments about my weight (I was about your size but two inches shorter.) In college I dropped some weight and long story short, the comments didn\u2019t stop, they just became digs about me being too small and not eating enough. I was 36 years old when I finally realized that for some people, even the ones you love, nothing you do will ever be \u201cenough\u201d, or \u201ccorrect\u201d, or whatever. Just do what makes you feel happy and healthy and don\u2019t worry about what anyone says, whether it\u2019s a stranger or a much-loved family member.", "NTA. Why should you lie to protect their feelings when they said things that hurt your feelings?", "NTA\n\nThey started out comparing you to others and assumed it would have no impact? Insanity.", "NTA. They said things that hurt you. They might not have intended to, but they did. Instead of breaking down, you used those as a starting point to do what you could to try to improve yourself, so that those things wouldn't be true anymore.\n\nThey're upset that you were hurt by what they said, but intend to take no ownership of the fact that they upset YOU. They want you to apologize for being hurt by what they said to hurt you? That's NOT how that works.", "NTA - they were bullying you for years and you let them know, nothing wrong with that at all.

It doesn't sound like you've told them not to speak to you that way before, or even how it makes you feel, so I could see them wishing you not to say that first time in front of the family but they need to take responsibility for what they said.

I ended up with disordered eating and even today, 20 years later, I have a difficult relationship with food and my body weight, my hair and my ears, all things they loved to comment on. Their words really left some damage on me. Please, I really think you should see a GP and get some therapy. It's the one thing I wish I had done earlier in my life.\n\nOP, your family will likely be harder and meaner to you than anyone else in life, just going by what you have described.
