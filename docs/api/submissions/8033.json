Ever since I started professional theater training two years ago, the comments have really ramped up. They usually have three things they comment on- my hair, my skin, and my weight. They know I\u2019m very proud of having very thick, black curly hair, so they often make comments about it being \u201cnot really black,\u201d and compare it unfavorably to my little sister\u2019s by saying hers is darker and \u201cless bushy.\u201d I also have a condition that makes my circulation very poor, so I\u2019m very pale, don\u2019t tan well, and have a lot of red in my skin tone, particularly my face, so it\u2019s a running \u201cjoke\u201d that I look like a vampire. The last one, and the one that does the most damage, is the comments on my weight. At my heaviest a year ago, I weighed around 133, but I\u2019m only 5\u20193\u201d, so it looked like more weight than it was. My older sister, who\u2019s very small and petite, describes me as \u201cheavy,\u201d and talks about how she wishes I could \u201cshare a few of my pounds\u201d with her.\n\nI decided earlier this year that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and after I got accepted to drama school, I committed to fixing the things I don\u2019t like about myself. I\u2019ve started taking care of my hair and learning how to use makeup to work with the red in my skin instead of against it. They didn\u2019t notice these changes, but they did notice when I started losing weight. I\u2019ve been calorie counting, and I\u2019ve lost six or seven pounds since the start of the year. \n\nLast night, after I refused a second bowl of pasta at a family dinner because I didn\u2019t have the calories for it, my mom commented on the fact that I\u2019d been losing weight, and asked why I felt like I needed to because I don\u2019t look bad the way I am. I was honest, and briefly described the last time I got called \u201cheavy\u201d by my sisters. I said that it really got to me and I wanted to make sure I really liked myself before I get to drama school, so that I\u2019m not battling as much insecurity while I\u2019m there. Everyone was kind of quiet afterwards, and my older sister left the table not long after and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Later that night my mom pulled me aside and said that I could do what I wanted with my body, but I shouldn\u2019t blame my sisters for the way I felt about myself. She said it had really hurt my sisters, particularly my older sister, that I had made them feel \u201cguilty\u201d about my choice to lose weight, and even if I\u2019m losing weight because of their comments, I should keep that to myself. My other two sisters have since told me that making my weight loss about them was inappropriate and asked me to apologize for \u201cputting that on them,\u201d because even if they did comment on my weight, they\u2019ve never told me I should lose any, so I have no right to try and make it their responsibility.

They sound like haters tbh or jealous of your figure tell them keep their opinions to themselves specially sin e uour gonna be looking better than them in no time keep working on yourself \ud83d\ude09 NTA", "Oh brother!!! NTA, not one doubt.\n\n1. It is a fact that your sisters made those comments.\n2. It is a fact that those comments are a part of your motivation to lose weight.\n3. If your sisters made those comments with good intentions and influenced you to do something they thought you needed to do, then why should it bother them that you acknowledge their influence in your life? If they think it is a negative that you link your motivation to lose weight to their comments, then why were they making those comments in the first place?\n4. They seem like folks who just like to have something to judge/complain about. I wouldn't worry about their perspectives too much. (Although, I imagine it is probably helping toughen you up for the cruel comments that can come in the acting profession.)\n5. Truth is, you made your choices to address your hair, skin, and weight. You own your choices and are happy with them. You are not blaming anyone for anything (at least from the tone of your post). You are only acknowledging their influence in your decision.", "NTA but there's no way you'll ever keep any weight off by losing weight from self-loathing.", "NTA in my opinion, good luck & keep up the good work.", "NTA. If they want to comment on somebody else's body they should face the consequences of the impact that has in a person, especially if it's family.\n\nThe mom is also wrong here since she cannot see that the one who's been really hurting was you and not them.", "Nta. Im sorry but your family sounds toxic & cruel. Its ok for them to comment on your weight, to give you body issues but how dare you repeat what they said or make them be accountable for it?! I can't even wrap my head around this! I hope you don't take their comments to heart or your moms reaction to it. I am same height, weight as you. I know ppl can carry it differently  but i am not big at all. Don't let them in your head & good luck", "NTA If they didn't want to know the truth about how they've been crappy sisters then maybe nobody should have asked you in front of them. Strange how it's okay for them to pick on you but it's not okay for you to be honest.", "NTA\n\nAnd frankly their concern that they're feeling guilty as a result of their YEARS of throwing unfavorable opinionated feedback about your looks is horrific..\n\nThey SHOULD feel guilty.. Maybe they'll think twice on how their \"WeLL I WaS jUsT BeInG HonEst!!\" *\"Opinions'* affect other people. \n\nTheir comments made you question your sense of self worth.. And that shit can stick with you for a fekin lifetime..\n\nIt's like blaming a victim because the clothes she wore made her look attractive enough to attack.. abhorrent logic.\n\nYou are beautiful.. you are valued.. they can suck up that feeling of guilt and shame as a penance for making you feel you NEED to change.\n\nSending you huge supportive hugs.. good luck with wherever your ventures take you X x", "\u201cI\u2019m being made to feel guilty over nasty comments I said, so you need to apologise.\u201d\n\nThey have some balls to pin this back onto you. \n\nHuge NTA\n\nThey\u2019re all a bunch of muppets", "Oh em gee. \u201cI have been hurtful and now people are calling me out on that?!?!\u201d\n\nNTA. Remind them all the time. They were mean. They should apologize TO YOU.", "Hahahaha NTA your family is really trying to make you the villain. Get therapy to get the tools to deal with them. You called out their bullying and how it had consequences and your own mother asked you to keep it to yourself because your upsetting you sisters. Tell me your the family scapegoat without telling me your the family scapegoat.", "Also, I would consider going LC with them all. Make them understand how it feels to be put on the back burner and ignored.", "NTY: Your sisters are gaslighting you. They have verbally and emotionally abused you. Your mother was either oblivious to the abuse or ignored it. FYI: 133 is a perfectly healthy weight for your height!", "Its really depressing that you think 133 and 5\u20193\u201d is heavy?? Society just wants women to waste away and keep us hungry. :(", "NTA\n\nWow, they are bullying you about your reaction to their bullying. They\u2019ve unlocked a whole new level of bullying.", "Well that\u2019s a bunch of BS! Your mom and sisters are being jerks! Why do you have to apologize for \u201cmaking them feel guilty\u201d when I\u2019ll bet they NEVER ONCE said they were sorry for the shitty things they said? I do not care if they say \u201cwe weren\u2019t trying to hurt your feelings\u201d! That\u2019s BS too! They feel guilty because they are guilty! Please keep working in your health and do it for you! It\u2019s fine if their negativity got you in the path to wellness but all the work and end results are for you! Good luck from one picked on sister to another!", "NTA I have 2 sisters. I weigh significantly more than both of them. Neither of them have ever mentioned my weight. Not once. Because they are not A Hs. There is nothing wrong with telling them their insults hurt you and you wish for them to stop. I would double down and if they want an apology, just repeat that over and over. Your insults hurt me and I want them to stop. It was insults, it was them trying to tear you down to make themselves feel superior. They are not. Know and see your own beauty. And that does not rest on your weight or your hair", "NTA and your family absolutely sucks. I hope you\u2019re planning to invest in some therapy to heal from the harm they cause you \ud83d\udc9c", "Good, I\u2019m glad they feel guilty. They are literally at fault. Doesn\u2019t matter how confident someone is with their body, being constantly insulted by people who are supposed to treat you kindly will destroy your self esteem.\n\nNTA", "Hmmm. Why does your mom & sisters think it's okay for them to comment on your weight, but when it comes to how you feel about that while explaining why you want to lose weight, you should keep that to yourself?\n\nNTA. They're feeling guilty because they should. Tell mom you're allowed to feel how you feel & they need to apologize for commenting on your body in the first place.", "NTA. You tell everyone there that those are your feelings, and you have a right to vocalize them. They had no problem time and again calling you out about your weight, so it is on them that your super- sensitive about it. They owe you an apology, and if they can't own up to their share in making you feel insecure maybe going LC would be a good idea for awhile. Time to ignore the toxic people! Good luck OP!!", "NTA - the reason why your sisters feel guity is because their past actions have been pointed out to them as actions which should induce guilt. So, the natural human response is to feel guilt. That response is there as the mind's internal teaching mechanism to do better in the future, and to not do actions which would induce guilt in the future.\n\nYour mom is aware of this in her heart and is wanting you to apologise, so that it makes it your fault and that makes it (in her head) that she didn't ignore bullying of one daughter by the others and that means she wasn't a bad parent (because there was plenty of bullying here not just about weight but also about your hair and skin and I'm sure lots else).\n\nDon't apologise.\n\nIf you do, because you can't resist, say that you're \"sorry that they feel guilty about the things they said to you in the past which has made you ashamed of your weight\" - a non-apology in other words - but, I repeat, don't apologise if you can at all avoid it because it's important for them to learn this lesson.", "NTA, your mom, however, is TA. I can see where your sisters get it from.", "They should be supportive of your efforts, not being so unconstructive and making it all about their supposedly hurt feelings. YOU have every right to feel hurt that they are not supporting you in your goals.  What kind of good sister does not have her sister\u2019s back?  And what kind of mother plays her kids off against each other and takes sides?", "NTA. You were asked why and told her, for her to then say to keep it to yourself is very hypocritical. If they can\u2019t handle feeling guilty then they shouldn\u2019t say things like that to you", "Op has said they\u2019re working together with a doctor on this, so I\u2019m not worried about that. Her mental health is probably what needs to be focused on\u2026", "60 kilos is like a perfectly normal weight wtf", "And mom agreed with them.  How fucked up is that?", "Sheesh, your family's giving you grief about weight loss and now you're getting it here too.  Keep up the great work that you're doing for yourself.  You and your doctor know your body more than anyone else here.", "What plan do you use?", "Having your own opinions: \ud83d\udc4d\n\nHaving an opinion and constantly badgering someone to follow through with their expectations, to the point where that persons confidence is significantly lower: \ud83d\udc4e", "Ah, that\u2018s good, thanks for sharing. \n\nYes, mental health is definitely worrisome, I agree. Hopefully all will turn out well for OP.", "Nooo the heck it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve lost weight that fast only once and it was because I was in boot camp, and I was ordered to stuff my pockets with as many fattening snacks out of the mess as possible because my Sgt noticed I was going hollow, and I\u2019m much taller than OP. I wasn\u2019t skinny either, so", "Well said and important point. \n\nThe long-term lesson for OP is body automy.\n\nGiven their description, they are going to meet criticism, double speak, denial, and sabotage. \n\nSister's are going to bully and then blame OP when the results of their bullying come back to haunt them.\n\nMom is going to guilt OP for not eating - for listening to their own body cues, for positive behavior al adjustments when it means other siblings awful behavior had a light shined on it.\n\nIt's double speak, denial, and pure bs that is about themselves not OP. But they'll sure as heck make it OPs problem whenever they can.\n\nSo the change is OP finding new measures of their own behavior & how that feels and taking the stance that no one else except themselves and their health care person (with OPs permission) get to comment, have a say or tell OP how to do or be - staking out your body automy now will give them the personal power to ignore family bs.\n\nP.S. sisters are only mad bc they got called out on their bad behavior and that OP is improving herself as a by-product of their bullying instead of you letting them keep up the bullying.  This is about a dysfunctional family dynamic not OPs choices or success.", "As a 5'0 woman who weighs 122 lbs currently. I have easily lost and gained 10 lbs in a week. From water weight alone i fluctuate 3-5 lbs a day. Its possible for some people even when they are making healthy choices.", "Consumption", "Not to mention how a woman's cycle can effect weight. I know women who fluctuate upwards of 15 lbs between periods."]}
