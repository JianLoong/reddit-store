Do you not see what kind of a monster that would make her? That's what you are expressing that you think of her when you let your insecurities get the best of you here.\n\nThe dude likely has PTSD and needs the grounding, he's not competition, he's a suffering relative that she is trying to reassure so he can join family lunches without freaking out that someone's going to hurt him.", "He's her damn cousin, it's normal to have physical contact. You're the only one making it weird. Stop watching incest porn.", "Oh, mate. You draw the line at being jealous because your fianc\u00e9 comforted her cousin by putting her hand on his shoulder. \n\nJust wait until you find out she hugs her friends.", "\u2018You\u2019 don\u2019t get to draw the line. Your fianc\u00e9 is a grown woman who can decide for herself what she is comfortable with.", "It\u2019s. A. Shoulder. And her cousin you nasty. YTA", "Stop with the whataboutism, it has nothing to do with your situation.", "Stop saying you're not the jealous type. That's obviously a lie. This is her cousin and she was touching his shoulder. Any man who has a problem with that is a jealous weirdo.", "\u201cWould it be different if the entire situation was different?\u201d \n\nYou sound like a total dingdong", "YTA if you don't trust your girlfriend to be faithful with you with her adopted cousin you should just tell her that", "Yes, because it's basic human contact. Why don't you trust your fianc\u00e9e? Has she given you a reason? Do you look at other women with lust? Because you're either projecting or you really need therapy. If she kept touching him what was going to happen? Were they going to bump uglies on the table in front of everyone? You sound controlling and like a massive headache tbh.", "Yea it would have been.", "Unless your fianc\u00e9 is Ross Geller, you have nothing to worry about \n\nStay away from PH for awhile, yeesh", "Why did it make you uncomfortable?  If not jealously. \n\nYou keep asking how to improve your behavior.  Are you really that dense?", "Therapy.", "Why do you find her touching his shoulder so sexual and threatening?", "You improve your behavior by not asking her to remove her hand from his shoulder in the first place. And if you're struggling to do that, maybe talk to a therapist about why this bothers you do much. Your fiance is your partner, not your possession.", "Touch releases oxytocin. It's not about affection for affections sake. If you feel uncomfortable, try understanding first. \n\n\"I am uncomfortable therefore you must change your behavior to accommodate me.\"\n\nHow does this sound to you? It's what you do.", "Demonstrating affection can be done in multiple ways.\n\nI haven't asked my fiancee to stop demonstrating affection towards her cousin. I have asked her not to touch him for the whole lunch.", "Do you have a comment about OP?  Is it easier to criticize my opinion than to develop your own?", "not the point here", "adopted family, but that aside, she knew the boy had a crush on her and a hand on your shoulder might be comforting, but fot the entirety of the meal? that's just to much\n\nit feels more like she wanted to make sure he still has that crush. it is just not appropriate behaviour", "I agree, I\u2019m just pointing out that she is gaslighting him.", "Oh I think I got it. He's feeling guilty about *his* inappropriate boundaries so is projecting onto her! Good catch!", "This needs to be higher up!", "How does that have anything to do with this?", "Adopted cousin. Ive seen adopted family members get married before so that isn't a block. Ive seen people get attached to engaged or married people. None of what you said refutes what I said.", "Man, I guess schools are right, and shoulders are just too distracting.", "Touch is a form of affection - so yes you did ask her to stop being affectionate to someone she most likely sees as a little brother.", "Looks like a mistake to me. That comment doesnt have much, if anything, to do with what you said", "Adopted family IS STILL FAMILY you fucking asshole. My sister adopted from Guatemala, 5 years younger than me, and a POC(with my pasty white ass over here) IS MY SISTER. You\u2019re an asshole for even thinking being adopted makes a difference here. Please never adopt a child if you think this, because adopted children/family deserve just as much as a bio children/family and by this comment it shows you think otherwise", "But she\u2019s not. You think she\u2019s gaslighting him because she didn\u2019t \u201cjust say something like she didn\u2019t think it was inappropriate\u201d and I\u2019m saying it was beyond obvious she didn\u2019t think it was inappropriate and therefore didn\u2019t need saying. That\u2019s not gaslighting.", "There is a Jung quote \u2018prudish is a cover for brutishness\u2019 that always always ends up being true in my experience.\n\nThe pearl clutcher is either a closet foot fetishist who seemed to be wanting non consensual foot pics or they are the person who just likes to be cruel somehow.\n\nJung is flawed but this quote is solid gold in my experience.", "Because you\u2019re getting jealous over an innocent action like your wife placing an arm on her cousins shoulder, yet you want to sexualize peoples feet in a Yoga setting in order to sate your fetish - which is sexual in nature. \n\n\u201cIn order to reach an higher focus on my practice, I would like to try and have my foot fetish sated during an online class for example\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, is there a better way to include \"feet poses\" in a Zoom class without sounding like a perv?\u201d Edit: We\u2019re you planning on doing this non consensually by the way?", "All things are connected, my brother, and your past posts give vital context to your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and attitude.", "Just imagine if cousin had been wearing a tank top?! The audacity! /s", "I know adopted family is still family, dont act like you know me or that you know what i think or believe. because you don't, you just want to fuss. \n\ndon't start calling me names that is uncalled for\n\n the fact is he has had a crush on her and they are not blood related, so the feeling might be slightly different for that boy.", "This is not a valid point as I do not sexualize people's feet although I understand why you are thinking that based on my history. \n\nAs I said, there is no correlation between the two posts.", "Unfortunately this is not the case, brother. There is no correlation between the two posts.", "You sure sexualized your wife placing an *arm* over her cousins shoulder so it actually is relevant. \n\nAnd foot fetishes are sexual and you wanted people to show you their feet on zoom\u2026 During *yoga* classes which is highly inappropriate.", "You feel guilty about your lack of sexual boundaries and are projecting them onto your fianc\u00e9e. You need to explore that and work on yourself. This is a you problem, not a 'them' problem. You've been deflecting and projecting all over this post and you need to stop. I can't make this any clearer.", "But you do sexualize shoulders?", "You literally call it a fetish. Fetishes are sexual *by definition*.", "Then why where you uncomfortable when you\u2019re wife was placing her hand on her cousin shoulder. AND adding that he had a crush on her in the past.", "Sexualizing feet and sexualizing a shoulder. You you\u2019re right, completely unrelated", "When you realize that your actions all stem from the same root, you will achieve self-awareness. Blessings of the all-father upon you.", "I am not sure you are reading my replies or understanding them.\n\nI have already explained that I do NOT want people to show me their feet on Zoom (despite what your investigation work as dug out!)", "I\u2019m understanding it the same way all the other commenters did over on the Yoga Sub. The problem is you.", "You're a creep.", "Creep"]}
