They walked to the path that is signposted with the name of our house, and started to walk down it. I called out and asked if they were lost and if we could help them as that path only leads to our house. They said that they were staying in one of the houses nearby and considering renting this one in future so they wanted to go and have a look but if we were staying there they wouldn't go.
