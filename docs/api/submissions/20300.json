It's not worth calling someone an A because it's a very minor thing but I do think I'd side with your husband on principle. Unless the entire area was marked as private property and they would be trespassing there's really no harm in them just having a look. People do that all the time.

Everyone is saying there's no real harm done and op wasn't being generous etc but I can't fathom having the audacity to walk up to a rental property that I have *no way* of knowing whether or not it's currently occupied to \"have a look around\". Like what if OPs husband had gone out to pick up some breakfast to surprise OP and she was just chilling in bed? There would be no car to see (and indicate someone was there) and suddenly there would be two random strangers looking in through their windows! \n\nLike we need to back tf up and think about what it means to have privacy. As OP said there are pictures on the website if they are truly curious and want to rent it one day. There is NO reason they should just be popping by to have a look. Imagine if this were a hotel room, it wouldn't be okay for me to just \"pop in\" to check out the room without permission! And they weren't asking for permission first they only asked when OP approached them. Had OP not seen them they would've walked their merry way up to the building and had their look. \n\nMaybe it's because OP is a woman that she's immediately thinking about safety concerns (as she should! People are crazy). It's not appropriate to walk up to someone's rental without at least calling the owners to confirm it's unoccupied (if that's an option). Just walking up puts OP in a precarious situation. *This* time it was just some old couple without social awareness (because again ITS NOT OKAY TO JUST WALK UP AND TAKE A LOOKSEE AT SOMEONES RENTAL!) but what if next time it's some random dude claiming he's thinking of taking his family on vacation there? Would Ops husband still admonish her for not letting him have a look around without any prior warning or permission? \n\nOP rented the place, and as such has every reason to expect the same level of privacy as her own home provides (aka no one should be walking up and looking around unannounced and uninvited unless for emergency reasons). It's down right creepy and OP is NTA for feeling as such", "I think trespass is a bit of a stretch", "I understand what you're saying and it's a good point however as a card-carrying people-pleaser I don't think my tone would have been too aggressive.

This elderly couple just wanted to have a nosey. Maybe OP could have been a bit more polite, but they also have a right to privacy whilst staying there. - NAH", "Pictures and Google maps are really not at all as accurate as looking in person.", "Geez down voted for sounding like an ACTUAL reasonable person.. take a like bro", ">You don\u2019t own the property. It\u2019s not your house. And they can walk anywhere they want. Do you not understand how property ownership works. \n\nNeat, didn't know that I can go walk around other people's yards if they are only renting!", "This. If I go to a hotel I'm not expecting other guests to peer into my room just because I personally don't own the room.", "They are all in an area of vacation rentals. It\u2019s a vacation/tourist area. There was no malice intended here. They just asked to look around & were told no. End of story. \n\nOur family owns a ocean front private vacation home. People will innocently use our cut through path to get to the beach. Not realizing it\u2019s private property. If we are outside they will stop to ask about the house or enquirer if it\u2019s a rental. At best it\u2019s occasionally annoying but there\u2019s no principle involved. \n\nAnd yes.... we are often outside in our pajamas enjoying coffee or in bathing suits when people walk by. Just give a wave... Howdy neighbor!", "And everyone has their own expectations. Might be rude to OP but not others.", "Or better yet\u2026 chill the fuck out.", "No one here was being nasty.  Actually everyone here was quite polite.", "This posted twice just so you know", "Ah, you've met my sister in law, I see", "Sam? Dean?", "How would they arrange a viewing with the owners while they are staying nearby if you are in the home currently? Would you be okay with the owner kicking you out for a bit so they could show someone around?", "They'd have to walk to the house to ask.... somebody walking up to knock on the door is not out of order. Thinking absolutely no one should ever come up to your door without prior permission is pretty ludicrous.", "I\u2019m not even sure you had a right to do that. Surely outside is accessible to the public?", "But it sounds like they were on vacation too, so they probably don\u2019t live in the area. That would make it pretty hard to \u201carrange to view it with the owners\u201d before actually committing to staying there.\n\nI agree with most other top comments at this point. NAH, but I would have sided with your husband. I like spreading joy and sharing whenever possible.", "It\u2019s crazy how many people in the comments are low key throwing shade at you for putting up a reasonable boundary with an entitled couple.", "Yes, absolutely true. You *should* do that. But it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to try and sneak a peak.", "What was your objection, since you were leaving anyway?\n\nEdit:  After thinking about it more, I agree with you.  It\u2019s weird and intrusive.  Let them make arrangements with the leasing office if they want a tour.", "It\u2019s a vacation house in what sounds like an area full of vacation houses, exactly how much of the time do you think the owner hopes to have it standing empty? All the ones I\u2019ve ever been to or considered are always booked as solid as they possibly can be, there really isn\u2019t a lot of time when someone could be shown around without someone being there.", "They didn\u2019t just stroll up invited. They didn\u2019t know you were there and they went away when they did. \n\nYour husband would\u2019ve been more generous and probably hoped you\u2019d have the same generosity in spirit. That\u2019s fine. \n\nI was in a meeting today and had to let contractors out. My husband was on his way to a funeral and said \u201cthey came late so you can let them out when you\u2019re done\u201d and I was like why make their lives suck if I can just be in my meeting and still let them out. He would\u2019ve waited until his meeting ended because his focus requirements are different. They\u2019re the ones who came late but if you can do something to make someone\u2019s life momentarily better, why not.", "It\u2019s a vacation house, it wasn\u2019t designed for honeymoons. They happen to be on their honeymoon while staying in it but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is too. I\u2019m sure there are people on their honeymoon occasionally at campgrounds when we go camping but the campgrounds aren\u2019t explicitly designed for honeymooners.", "People don't see a vacation rental and think oooh I hope people aren't fucking in there.", "Who fucks with the blinds open lol", "Please reread my comment.", "If you leave the curtain open to your hotel room. Dont get angry when someone looks in from the street and accidentally sees you getting dressed.", "Agreed. Yeah, they can ask. They knew it was an intrusion. They knew better than to look without asking. Asking does not entitle them to get the response they want. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to say yes to every request.", "She did chill out.  She said no, politely.  The question was, is she T A for doing so, and the answer is no.  Husband thinks she is; he may not be wrong about thinking it wasn't a big deal to let them look, but he's wrong in thinking that there's something wrong with her for not letting them look.  Husband's the one who needs to chill the fuck out.", "Your comment doesn\u2019t seem very chill.", "Right.  It's one of those rare situations where everyone involved was being absolutely civil.", "I'd argue walking up to a private home(which any rental is) surrounded by shrubs and looking in the windows and the like is... A different definition of nasty. Either way, it's completely oblivious to social norms and depending where you live, dangerous.", "They said, they stayed at a similar vacation home, so they probably knew about the huge windows. Some people are weird and old people can be very shameless/perverted.", "Thanks, bud!", "Bobby?", "No need to kick out, but the owner could contact OP and husband to ask if they were amenable to let them and their visitors have a look.\n\nThe owner escorting the couple would be a guarantee that they were indeed prospective clientes and not someone scouting for nefarious reasons.", "not op\u2019s problem \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\nnah", "I don't know man, maybe call them and see if they could check it out during their stay. Maybe their trips didn't completely overlap. She's basically questioning why they didn't reach out to the owners first rather than just saunter in.", "Is that how you feel about your own backyard? As long as it\u2019s not literally inside your house, it\u2019s accessible to the public?", "OP referenced, \"it's the principle that you can't just go wandering up to someone's holiday house to 'have a look'.\" so she does seem to think that simply walking up to a house is illegal and \"wrong\" for some reason. Though she does specifically reference holiday house so maybe she thinks she's entitled to some special rules because it's a holiday house and not just a house? Either way this is pretty funny to me.", "So you ignored the \u201cfloor to ceiling windows\u201d and \u201cbuilt in an isolated manner, just like all the nearby properties\u201d. \n\nThere\u2019s a reasonable expectation of not having random people come & spy in your windows.", "But apparently \u201cmost people\u201d look at an isolated property that they don\u2019t own, and think \u201cwho could possibly mind if I walk right up & spy in the windows\u201d. \n\nY\u2019all have very weird ideas of reasonable boundaries.", "There's a difference here. The house is in a secluded part of the woods. Someone would have to go out of their way to see the house. A hotel is probably located in an urban area. People can't help but see the building.", "You're right. OP should have closed the curtain on their floor to ceiling windows \ud83d\ude44", "that isnt the same. if someone walks up to your hotel window and starts trying to peer through the cracks in the blinds/curtains, then you\u2019d be mad and creeped out.", "You sound creepy. When I pay to stay somewhere, I expect the same level of privacy and safety I have in my own home. That\u2019s the point of paying to stay somewhere. If someone looked into my holiday house or wandered around it I would call the police.", "This is between husband & wife. The couple just asked the question. It appears they had no issue with the response.", "Oh dw, It\u2019s perfectly chill. I\u2019m using \u201cfuck\u201d for emphasis, not out of anger :)", "Everything you\u2019re saying here is a non-issue because no where in the post does it say anything like that. You\u2019re jumping to some very large conclusions based on nothing", "Ah reddit, when in doubt assume the worst as fact.", "Cas?", "My backyard has a gate and a 6ft wall\u2026 the lane behind it is accessible though. As is the pavement outside my house.", "They were on the *pathway* to the house though, not the backyard.", "Backyard, no. Front yard, sure, pass through but don\u2019t loiter.", "Perhaps if there were no solicitation signs or no trespassing signs posted. Otherwise its perfectly legal to walk up to any house and knock on the door. Its annoying but legal", "Unless it's literally on a cliffside I really disagree that \"floor to ceiling\" windows are ever built with the expectation nobody would ever peer into them. Good grief.", "Who the hell walked right up to the windows? They were down the dirt path leading up to the house. They then ASKED to look at the property they were interested in renting in the future. \n\nThey didn't have their faces pressed up against the windows\n\nY'all have weird ways of being able to look at things from someone else's perspective.", "In the woods.", "Have you ever said \u201cchill the fuck out\u201c to someone and they took it as a chill comment? It\u2019s a harsh and aggressive comment.", "Garth?", "Crowley?", "\"CHILL THE FUCK OUT.\" Dumbledore said CALMLY.", "Yes. I have?", "Dave?", "Rowena?", "Rosdower?", "Still not chill.
