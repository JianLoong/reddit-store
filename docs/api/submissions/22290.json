I know my partner would be heartbroken to know my twin didn't come\n\nWell, clearly your twin does not love your late partner enough not to pull this petty bullshit, nor give him the respect he deserves by attending his funeral. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, and your brother trying to emotionally blackmail you is appalling. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm sorry for you loss. And you shouldn't be having to deal with this narcisstic bullshit from your brother.\n\nPeople go funerals to mourn the people they loved. \n\nNot to win one-upmanship contests with grieving family. Your brother didn't love your partner or you enough to have the decency to support you instead of, whatever this is. And this isn't an autism thing.\n\nYou're not preventing him from coming. He's choosing not to.\n\nNTA", "\u201cI know my partner would be heartbroken to know my twin didn\u2019t come, and it\u2019d be because of me.\u201d\n\nIt would be because of your twin. Your twin is making the choice not to attend the funeral. More accurately, your twin is using his (non) attendance at the funeral as leverage to get you to do something.\n\nNTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "All the stuff you mentioned sounds like pretty normal sibling hassling. It's possible he sees your actions as much more heinous than you (and so, we) do. But if he felt that strongly about it, it seems like he would just refuse to come entirely. It sucks that he's chosen this time to extort you and you would be justified in calling his bluff and letting him stay home. I think that's what I'd do in your situation. But, you also really want him to be there. Only you can say whether it would be worth it to let him push you into this. \n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. Nothing in his list of demands seems to have any connection to attending the funeral. If he's this petty, it doesn't seem like he'd be much of a supportive presence for you. Let him stay home and nurse his childish grievances.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. Things must be hard.\n\nBut also INFO... what am I missing? If your twin was close to your partner, why would he not want to come to the funeral for himself to say goodbye? What has happened more recently? Is your relationship utterly broken more broadly? ...or is he just a really clueless AH in general?\n\nIf you were in the wrong in all those past instances and you do want your brother there maybe do just offer a brief general apology (I regret that stuff that happened when we were kids?) and let him know he is welcome to come if he'd like but it's up to him? ... only because it is all petty, and you must have so much else going on right now to organise without rehashing old sibling dramas. \n\nBut your brother withholding his attendance based on this is messed up, and he clearly has no sense of proportion or scale here. He's the AH.", "NTA. This is a completely inappropriate time for your brother to be giving you an ultimatum like this. What an incredibly insensitive thing for him to do. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Technically, you are not preventing him from anything; HE made the ultimatum, so HE is preventing himself from attending. The list he has looks like a standard list of crap that siblings fo to each other; using it as a bludgeon while you just list your mate to suicide is not only petty, but cruel.\nThe only AH here is your twin. Tell him he can attend or not at his discretion, but keep petty childhood disputes in their own space.", "NTA In so sorry for your loss. You really need to stop engaging with your brother when you are this vulnerable. All you are doing now is piling onto your grief. That puts your mental health at risk.  Wouldn't your partner would be more heartbroken by the torture your brother is putting your thru?", "NTA. You\u2019re preventing nothing. This is an inappropriate time to hash out sibling issues. Making an ultimatum about a funeral is an AH move.\n\nMaybe you do owe him apologies (Reddit isn\u2019t qualified to answer this, especially without details). He should decide whether or not to go to the funeral, and leave you out of the decision process.", "Something is mentally wrong with your brother and he needs help.  That said...you need grieve and inch forward with your own life.", "NTA  \nI am sorry for your loss. Your brother is an adult who if choosing not to pay his respects at the funeral, that is 100% on him. He is a selfish prick who is adding to your pain and showing that he had no respect for your partner by using his funeral as a bargaining chip to rehash petty slights. His actions are disgusting and all your energy should be focused on just getting through this. Not sure I would stay in close contact with a person like this.", "NTA.......so he waited until your partner died, to give you  a list of things you bullied him about  and demand an apology?  Your brother is and AH", "NTA", "So he wants to take advantage of your current loss and resulting vulnerability, to settle some really petty perceived slights? How would your partner feel about this side of him? NTA. It\u2019s not your fault if he isn\u2019t there, it\u2019s his decision and he decided to be petty.", "NTA. There are clearly some unresolved issues between yourselves, however this demand is just blackmail. If you were to apologise, I would ask an apology in return for the pain caused to you by his timing. \nSo sorry for your loss \ud83d\ude14", "NTA. The f? \n\nAlso with how petty and manipulative he is I think it\u2019s a Very good call to not count on him driving you to the airport as it sounds entirely within his nature you leave you hanging and potentially miss your flight.", "NTA. Your twin is making this all about him -- how callous and self-centered! I'm so very sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry you have a family member making things even more difficult for you. Hugs.", "NTA. What you need during the funeral is support and your brother (even if present) would not only not give you the support but would probably make things worse. \nYou are better off without him there.

OP, I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m also sorry that your sibling chose the worst possible time to air his grievances. That\u2019s not okay of him.\n\nHowever, based on your post, you did bully your brother. You insulted his interests, insulted his tastes, used a personal detail about him for your own benefit without his permission, and mocked him. Your brother is wrong for bringing this up now, but he is not wrong for still being upset about these things and wanting an apology and change in behavior. You make think those things are too small for him to care about, but small things add up. \n\nI have autism, and grew up with neurotypical siblings, and I can fully understand why your twin is upset about these things. Just because you see it as \u201ctypical sibling bickering\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he does. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were a good sibling growing up.", "NTA you not prevent him from going to funeral he just don't want to go.", "NTA I would be tempted to apologize for everything on the list, because who cares.  Apologies are free and all that is in the past.  When I'm done I would ask him if he forgives me.  If no, he is a child.  Hopefully, a sincere apology leads to forgiveness.  Make him say it.", "NTA - \"You're trying to blackmail me at a time like this?  I won't hear another word about it.   \n If you don't show up, you're dead to me going forward.

Not for the dead.\n\n>  I know my partner would be heartbroken to know my twin didn't come,\n\nYTA.  He doesn't want to go.  Let him grieve in his own way.  \n\nThere is an argument he should be there to support you - but you clearly don't have that type of relationship.  So just let him stay away, and do his own thing.\n\nAgain - funerals are *not* for the dead.  The dead don't care.  Funerals are for the living.", "ESH - Soft Y T A for you (mostly Y T A to yourself for not just doing it and moving on) and Strong Y T A for your brother.\n\nWhat possible reason could you have for not offering a sincere apology to your brother for a short list of things you've done that hurt his feelings? This is the shortest distance between two points and should have been a no brainer. You're playing into whatever mental game he's playing by not just doing it and moving on. It's strange that your brother felt he had to catch you a vulnerable time and demand it. Has he never asked for and received an apology for these things before?\n\nOn the other hand, your brother is also a huge AH for acting out during a traumatic time in your life. You've got enough on your plate and are in the process of grieving your partner's death. Why can't he leave you grieve and just be supportive instead of causing more chaos and making this about him and his unresolved feelings?\n\nTo be honest, when someone close us to takes their own life, it hits us in very profound and unforeseen ways. It's weird that your brother was close to your partner and used his death to hurt you. I'm certain there is more going on in his head than meets the eye.", "Sucde?", "Info: Has the subject of your \u2018abuse\u2019 ever come up between the two of you before? Was this out of the clear blue sky? And did *he* ever do anything to you in return?", "YTA And clearly this issue between you two has been going on gar longer than the time of your partners death. You expect someone to come to funeral and be there for you emotionally while you continue to deny your their own hurts and pain? It costs you absolutely nothing to apologize to him.
