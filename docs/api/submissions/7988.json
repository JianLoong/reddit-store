Obviously I don't know what the laws are like where you are.\n\nAlso did you make your landlord / leasing agency aware of when you moved out so they could scrub your name from the record? If you signed the paperwork to say you live there, I think you have a basic responsibility to let them know when you leave\n\nNTA for being upset about the situation, because obviously it is worrying to have an unknown debt land on you, and not being sure how it's going to affect you, but I do think you should research your situation a bit more, if nothing else then it's handy to know for future referencd", "NTA she should have taken you off the rental agreement when you moved out. You have every right to be angry when it's affecting your ability to get future credit or affecting any further money issues that may arise.", "NTA but you should have had made sure that she took you of the lease. And don\u2019t all the tenants that are on the lease have to sign? Did she forge your signature?", "NTA\n\nHowever, it is your responsibility to make sure you were taken off the lease.\n\nYour mom is the AH.  Your mom may have used you because her credit was not good enough.  You mom may have left you on it because she didn't have good enough credit to stay without you on it.  It sucks that she messed your credit up.\n\nyou can try to dispute it.  Maybe they will not respond and the credit companies will remove it.\n\nETA, if it is collections they may come after you", "NTA. I would ask the landlord for copies of all of the paperwork regarding the lease renewals. It is very suspicious that you are still on the hook years after you moved out. Your mom sounds like a deadbeat, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she had pulled some shenanigans here.", "NAH. People sign stuff without reading it all the time. Your mom says she didn't know you would be on the hook for her debt, so unless you think she is a liar you should believe her. Credit repairs itself over time.

Your mother should have done her research or ensured that your name was removed from the lease before renewing it.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider that you were also partially responsible for signing the lease as a tenant and not fully understanding the consequences of that decision. It would be understandable if you were angry when you found out about the debt, but it is important to have a calm and open conversation with your mother about the situation to understand her perspective and find a solution.\n\nIn this situation, it is not fair to blame one person entirely as it is a shared responsibility. Therefore, you are not the asshole (NTA) for confronting your mother about the situation, but it is important to handle the conversation in a mature and understanding manner.", "If you have proof of other residency after you left the apartment with your mom, you may be able to challenge the debt legally with the apartment complex but it would be wise to talk with a real estate attorney who deals with deliquint renters & knows your state's laws. Definitely challenge it with the credit reporting agencies to see if you can get it removed from your credit report.", "NTA and yeah as others have said you should be able to get this scrubbed from your credit history if you never personally signed the second year of the lease. Look up how to file paperwork with the credit bureaus.", "NTA You weren't living there, it's not your debt. I also vote for looking into how you had a lease renewed without your consent.", "I also have this question - OP, you should contact the leasing office and dispute the debt. Ask for a copy of that lease.", "Leases can renew automatically if not terminatedin writing.", "In many rental agreements, the lease automatically converts to month to month upon expiration of the terms. So unless OP gave notice of termination she could be on it indefinitely.", "She might have asked, and the leasing agent was lazy and never made the change too. Still her fault for not getting it fixed when she got the doc", "They\u2019ll probably be probing OP for info they can use for collections, so hopefully he can be careful while doing so.", "Still worth checking.", "NTA. But it sounds like both you and your mother were ignorant of the financial obligation of being named on a lease. You cannot excuse your ignorance of the ramifications while holding your mother fully accountable. And credit isn't \"ruined.\" It's a ding on your credit history that can, over time, be recovered from. You could get in touch with the company that filed the derogatory trade line. See if you can work out an arrangement to pay something towards the debt and have it removed from your credit history. Or you could wait the standard seven years and the item will drop off of its own accord.", "ESH.\n\nYou say your mom could have researched it. To be fair, so could you. You signed the original lease admitting that you knew nothing about how to do that or what it means. You could have done your own research. Your age and ignorance is not an excuse.", "Take it to small claims court, sounds like a slam dunk.", "There's being a co-signer on the lease and then there's being a tenant. Tenants over 18 may have to sign for occupancy but that does not make them liable to the landlord.", "Yeah where I am leases just automatically renew.\n\nFor anything over a year long lease it's actually a fairly involved process to terminate.", "No, in most places all tenants over 18 are on the lease as tenants and that makes them responsible for all of the lease provisions.", "In my state occupants don't sign anything, so that would not be the case here. If you sign on the lease as a tenant you are financially responsible.", "I would need to see the paperwork."]}
