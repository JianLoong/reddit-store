I posted this when I was at work, before I knew if Beth was gone. I felt guilty for putting my roommate in that position, but I feel better after reading the comments. \n\nThis whole issue for this post occurred last night, and I left for work at 8 am. I did not know if Beth was gone until I got home at 5. My roommate kicked Beth out. Idk where she went, but she is gone. My roommate and I had a talk. Apparently, Beth is adopted, and, ever since she found out last year, she has been acting this way. It does not justify her behavior. However, I have worked with adopted children, so I understand where the behavior comes from. \n\nMy roommate was scared that kicking her out would make Beth feel like she was less of her family. Also, my roommate\u2019s parents and grandparents pay her rent so she feared being cut off financially. I do not hold this against her bc I understand that situation. \n\nUltimately, my roommate says that I am more of a sister than a best friend and that trumps cousin any day of the week. If her family cuts her off, then they cut her off. She would rather that than me not be around anymore, which honestly makes me feel great.", "Anyone with a barely functioning moral compass would label you NTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe already broke the terms of the agreement by letting her extend her stay. Family or not, you get as much of a say on who lives there as she does. If your roommate cannot grow a backbone and kick this miserable person out, then you need to step up and do so. If your roommate cannot accept this, then tell her to get her own place with her cousin.", "NTA. Beth sucks and should be committed to an institution.", "NTA, sounds like a reasonable ultimatum to me.", "Info: Why is Beth staying with you? \n\nI think you need go google the definition of the word guest and show it to her.", "NTA choice should be easy seeing as your roommate admitting to wanting her gone too. Beth is HER family not yours so you are under no obligation to put up with her and unless your roommate owns the house, she has no right to force this on you past the agreed upon time period. If she doesn't want to make the choice, the landlord can.", "NTA. Throwing a drink at someone is considered assault. Beth is an exploiter. she is mooching of you and your roommate. Don't let Beth force you out your own apartment. If you can escalate this issue to the landlord, tell them that Beth assaulted you, and tell a fib that Beth been staying rent free in your apartment for weeks to landlord. If Zaya won't kick her out, then landlord will for sure.", "NTA. Time for Beth to pack up and get out. I\u2019d pack her bags for her and set them on the lawn. Sayonara.", "The question of house guests requires 2 yeses but only 1 no. NTA", "NTA. Beth has gone far beyond just overstaying her welcome. Family or not, treating your home and your other guests like garbage is definitely grounds for getting kicked out. Your roommate's expectation for you to keep dealing with Beth's disrespect just because she's family is unreasonable.", "Based on what you've told us, definitely you are NTA. I just wonder if there's more context. Did Zaya do anything? I see no redeeming qualities to this Beth person.  \n\n\nAlso, about the end.. You said your roomate said having Beth there was awful. Was that a typo?", "NTA. This person sounds absolutely awful.", "Easy NTA from me. That sounds like a truly awful situation to be in.", "You should get a say here too. And you can \u201cvote\u201d with your feet. Your roommate doesn\u2019t  have to like it. But she can deal with it if you decide to GTFO. NTA", "NTA. She sounds awful.", "Her cousin needs to go. She isn't on the lease, nor is she welcomed. She has overstayed. Roommate needs to tell her she needs to go. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Stand your ground.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
