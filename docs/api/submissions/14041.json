We were together briefly, she got pregnant, and we tried to make things \u201cwork\u201d but\u2026 well, it just didn\u2019t.  We didn\u2019t love each other like that. We\u2019d known each other for 10 years and had mutual friends, and got along well as FRIENDS but made the \u201cmistake\u201d of a fling for a few months.  Anyways, we lived together early on in our daughters life and it worked well but eventually needed our own places.  This was incredibly difficult for our daughter to understand but I think we did an OK job of explaining it to a 3 year old.  Hell, it was hard for us too.   We don\u2019t hate each other, nor do we have animosity for each other. In fact, we\u2019re super close and our daughter now understands the situation much better.  She\u2019s so bright. Did I mention how awesome she is?  Anyways\u2026 so I have a fianc\u00e9 I met near the end of my living with the ex.  I was transparent with my situation completely and she has always been cool with it. I celebrate holidays together often with the ex (and fianc\u00e9) and our kiddo, have gone there to help with things if needed, and recently even stayed there overnight and half a day while my daughter was incredibly sick for 4 days.  My ex needed sleep, had been off two days and had a huge presentation to give.  My fianc\u00e9 was invited but declined and was okay with it.  She said now that once we get married, boundaries need to be set and we need very specific arrangements for when my daughter will be at my place and when we  have her under our care.  We have rough outlines, but early on made an agreement to do what we felt was right - if she calls and my daughter wants to come over for a few days or even the night, totally fine.  Goes both ways.  We have nearly zero co parenting issues.  My fianc\u00e9 also says that having her \u201cas much as we do\u201d is a lot and one full weekend a month is enough.  She says that spending holidays together is too much, and they need to be separate.  She knew we did that early on, and I told her that early on it\u2019s how we did things. She has always been okay with it.  Her and my daughter get along great and she does with my ex as well so this is kind of out of left field - but she has made it clear things will change. Some of it I get, other stuff (certain things especially) I won\u2019t budge on.  She says I\u2019m choosing my ex( I think I\u2019m choosing my daughter).  Am I the AH?

Dear OP, your fiancee wants you without any children.

I didn\u2019t want to \u201cwing it\u201d when there are kids involved. I came to the conclusion that I really wanted this (have always loved children in general so why wouldn\u2019t I love the child of the man I love?). He is with us a few days a week. In the beginning I had a hard time. Not because I wanted him gone, but when he was gone I was missing him like crazy and it was sooooo quiet in our house. If he wants to stay extra days with us I am so happy. I don\u2019t think I could be with someone who has a child and I wouldn\u2019t want the child to be around. And my spouse was also very clear that he was a package deal (I never wanted otherwise). I think this is important for you as well OP. You need to be with someone who doesn\u2019t see your child as a burden but as a child that makes life better. If she doesn\u2019t want a life with you AND your child, do you want to be with her? We can\u2019t answer that question for you.\n\nI also think you and your ex are amazing coparents with a great situation. Keep up the good work!

I get that. Totally understand and when she brought it up I said no problem - but honestly it\u2019s not THAT often my daughter will ask to come over randomly.

It\u2019s just so weird because this JUST came out.  I think a huge part of it actually stems from last month she had mentally made plans without telling me and got home from work and my daughter was there wanting a movie night.
