We were together briefly, she got pregnant, and we tried to make things \u201cwork\u201d but\u2026 well, it just didn\u2019t.  We didn\u2019t love each other like that. We\u2019d known each other for 10 years and had mutual friends, and got along well as FRIENDS but made the \u201cmistake\u201d of a fling for a few months.  Anyways, we lived together early on in our daughters life and it worked well but eventually needed our own places.  This was incredibly difficult for our daughter to understand but I think we did an OK job of explaining it to a 3 year old.  Hell, it was hard for us too.   We don\u2019t hate each other, nor do we have animosity for each other. In fact, we\u2019re super close and our daughter now understands the situation much better.  She\u2019s so bright. Did I mention how awesome she is?  Anyways\u2026 so I have a fianc\u00e9 I met near the end of my living with the ex.  I was transparent with my situation completely and she has always been cool with it. I celebrate holidays together often with the ex (and fianc\u00e9) and our kiddo, have gone there to help with things if needed, and recently even stayed there overnight and half a day while my daughter was incredibly sick for 4 days.  My ex needed sleep, had been off two days and had a huge presentation to give.  My fianc\u00e9 was invited but declined and was okay with it.  She said now that once we get married, boundaries need to be set and we need very specific arrangements for when my daughter will be at my place and when we  have her under our care.  We have rough outlines, but early on made an agreement to do what we felt was right - if she calls and my daughter wants to come over for a few days or even the night, totally fine.  Goes both ways.  We have nearly zero co parenting issues.  My fianc\u00e9 also says that having her \u201cas much as we do\u201d is a lot and one full weekend a month is enough.  She says that spending holidays together is too much, and they need to be separate.  She knew we did that early on, and I told her that early on it\u2019s how we did things. She has always been okay with it.  Her and my daughter get along great and she does with my ex as well so this is kind of out of left field - but she has made it clear things will change. Some of it I get, other stuff (certain things especially) I won\u2019t budge on.  She says I\u2019m choosing my ex( I think I\u2019m choosing my daughter).  Am I the AH?

I\u2019m friends with her stepmom, my other kids are friends with her kid(daughter\u2019s half sister) \n\nSpeaking of her stepmom, she\u2019s got a great one. She embraced my daughter as her own. She has always been incredibly supportive of my ex\u2019s relationship with our daughter. I\u2019m so grateful for that. It would have been deeply hurtful to my daughter if her dads new wife had decided that one weekend was fine and cut off their relationship. \n\nI can\u2019t express to you how much you should not marry this woman. She\u2019s already showing her ass. It will only get worse.", "Adding here OP to please use protection. Do not believe her saying she is on BC. You have a great thing going with your daughter.. don\u2019t ruin that. There are other partners out there that would never ask to reduce seeing your daughter once a month. That\u2019s really shameful.", "She\u2019s been playing nice. She\u2019s has these feeling since the beginning but chose to hide them to rope you in figuring you\u2019d be to hooked on her and you\u2019d happily make changes. Dump this woman like yesterday. You marry her your relationship with your kid will suffer and you will end up resenting your soon to be ex fianc\u00e9e and your kid wil resent you.   Your kid should come first. You\u2019re a package deal and if she can\u2019t accept it then she\u2019s not your person.  There was a just a post a few days ago where someone all of a sudden got full custody because the mom could no longer take care of the kid. What if anything happens to kids mom and you get full custody? These things do happen. But you should stick with as much time as you have with her (which  anymore should be 50/50 in most cases). Don\u2019t sacrifice your time with your kid for a shitty fianc\u00e9e\nAlso would you want to have kids with someone who expects you to really limit contact with your kid just because she\u2019s not her bio kid? There are so many red flags here I\u2019d not just walk away but tun.", "Shave a little here, a little there, missed visits \"because . . . \" It has begun.\n\n**OPEN. YOUR. EYES.**", "When you have children you have never off. She doesnt see her as family but as s chore.. you wouldnt give away your own children to have every week off. \nShe sees her as your exes child and wants you without your child... do not marry her or have any children with her. She will always treat them differently", "Ah yes only 3/4 days out of 30/31 days. That totally makes it sound better and not at all like she's trying to cut the contact between you and your child.", "I mean\u2026 most parents don\u2019t get a day \u201coff\u201d. What if your ex has an emergency and you need to keep your daughter on a Friday? What if she becomes incapable of caring for her in some way and you need to take full custody? Your fianc\u00e9e has unrealistic expectations.", "She is still cutting time. It will get worse not better. OP I get it you want a personal live and that\u2019s great. It should not come at the expense of your child.  I saw my brother do this where he found a woman and neglected his children. They\u2019re adults now and are pretty much train wrecks. Don\u2019t do this to your daughter. Keep gf if you must but do not marry her.", "But still only once a month?!?!", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a Friday date night, just the two of you. There IS something wrong with asking you to see your daughter one weekend a month. There are 4 Fridays. Pick one for date night.", "Dude she wants your daughter to be in her life (and therefore yours) as little as possible. \n\nLeave her before you waste a ton of money on a wedding and a divorce.", "I wouldn\u2019t even celebrate Christmas if I didn\u2019t have my kids. Christmas morning would just be weird/lonely if were just me and my husband. Lol\n\nNTA. I would ~at least~ cancel the engagement until this is sorted out because if she\u2019s saying these little things here and there now, imagine what she\u2019ll be demanding when you\u2019re married.", "When you have kids you don\u2019t get to just make last minute plans, and plans always need to remain flexible in the event of sickness/emergency. \n\nEven if there aren\u2019t kids, she can\u2019t just on whim make plans without any notice, most people aren\u2019t okay with that. \n\nShe needs to understand this, or she\u2019s not ready to marry a man with a child.", "She\u2019s trying to squeeze your daughter out. If you get married it will only get worse.", "Never marry someone who makes demands of your time with the ones you love be it parents, kids, grandparents.", "She let you see that that's what she wants. She wants it just the two of you. Is that what you want, because if you stay that's hpw it will end up.", "NTA. I get that some bounderies would be needed. She doesn't want to be the third wheel on the wagon. However the boundaries she suggested are ridiculous. It's perfectly normal to split the holidays for instance. But tell her that when bounderies will be set it's going to be much closer to 50/50 custody. Holidays can be split. Plenty of people do it. I get you don't want your So's ex over at every holiday. But those can be divided between households as so many divorced parents do.\n\nIf she can't accept that, she needs to go.", "Please don't listen to the above comment.\n\nMy parents had a horrible divorce, but the time we spent with them was very flexible and shifted based on needs of everyone. My sister and I were not confused by a \"lack of home base\" and it is helpful to say \"look I really need help with my science project, can I stay with dad for a few days\" or \"my English essay is really rough, I'd like to be with mom for a bit.\" I don't remember them ever saying no and it helped what was otherwise a rough situation.", "THIS X 1000. \n\nBest comment award goes to PrizeMix! This is so spot on.", "This! I would not be with a man who didn\u2019t put his children first. I\u2019m childless and when my partner\u2019s kids were younger they came first. We celebrated holidays around his scheduled time with his kids. If it conflicted with my family\u2019s celebrations he did his thing and I did mine. \n\nI\u2019ve seen so many parents and stepparents put their needs and wants above what\u2019s best for the kids. (My brother was one of those). Kids come first, period.", " There are other partners out there that would never ask to reduce seeing your daughter once a month.", "I think she\u2019s jealous as well. It\u2019s troubling TBH. My partner and his ex were in constant contact because of their kids and I admired how they coparented as a team. OP should be concerned as this isn\u2019t a good sign.  His Ex will always be in his life to some extent because of the kid.", "Best phrase ever: \"once someone shows you who they are, believe them\". \n\nEven if the fiance is not a narcissist. She clearly shows signs of someone who thought that once engaged and definitely once married she would have the ability to dictate OP's life. Her saying one weekend a month is enough is far different than wanting a handful of guaranteed nights off, which is how she is pretending to frame it. \nBut the fact is she does not want to be a step-mother and wants OP the choose her over their daughter. \n\nOP is a lucky man to have such a great co-parenting set up and having an healthy relationship with the mother. I am part of the Fathers Rights Movement and cannot tell you how much other dad's in the world would give to have what OP has. \nI hope OP certainly reevaluates if he wants this lady has his life partner.", "Exactly. \n\nHe should tank his fiance, really, for playing her hand too early when he can walk away.", "Exactly, she played the 'practice round' and passed, now its time for her 'real' family, without the 'practice kid'.\n\nI'd run without looking back.", "I don't know why but I was particularly hit by this.  I have seen so many bad breakups, births where people isolate their partner, manipulate, play games.\n\nThis guy wont the fucking jackpot.  Yet, he is teetering and edging himself towards the biggest mistake of his life.", "Then she needs to marry someone that doesn't have children.", "If she wants guaranteed days off she can take those Fridays off alone. Why does she expect you to not have your daughter those days? She is not ready to be a stepparent.", "OP, i had a step-mom similar to your fianc\u00e9e. she was happy with being a \u201cweekend parent\u201d, but the situation changed and i had to move in with my dad full time. \n\nshe kicked me out at 16 because she resented parenting a child that wasnt hers. \n\nim telling you, as someone who has *been* your daughter, that you need to do whats best for **her**. when someone shows you who they are, believe them. my dad didnt believe my stepmom, and now he doesnt have a son anymore. dont do something you\u2019ll regret", "See the king in every fairytale who always seems to pick the worst possible woman for wife #2.
