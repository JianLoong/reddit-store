We were together briefly, she got pregnant, and we tried to make things \u201cwork\u201d but\u2026 well, it just didn\u2019t.  We didn\u2019t love each other like that. We\u2019d known each other for 10 years and had mutual friends, and got along well as FRIENDS but made the \u201cmistake\u201d of a fling for a few months.  Anyways, we lived together early on in our daughters life and it worked well but eventually needed our own places.  This was incredibly difficult for our daughter to understand but I think we did an OK job of explaining it to a 3 year old.  Hell, it was hard for us too.   We don\u2019t hate each other, nor do we have animosity for each other. In fact, we\u2019re super close and our daughter now understands the situation much better.  She\u2019s so bright. Did I mention how awesome she is?  Anyways\u2026 so I have a fianc\u00e9 I met near the end of my living with the ex.  I was transparent with my situation completely and she has always been cool with it. I celebrate holidays together often with the ex (and fianc\u00e9) and our kiddo, have gone there to help with things if needed, and recently even stayed there overnight and half a day while my daughter was incredibly sick for 4 days.  My ex needed sleep, had been off two days and had a huge presentation to give.  My fianc\u00e9 was invited but declined and was okay with it.  She said now that once we get married, boundaries need to be set and we need very specific arrangements for when my daughter will be at my place and when we  have her under our care.  We have rough outlines, but early on made an agreement to do what we felt was right - if she calls and my daughter wants to come over for a few days or even the night, totally fine.  Goes both ways.  We have nearly zero co parenting issues.  My fianc\u00e9 also says that having her \u201cas much as we do\u201d is a lot and one full weekend a month is enough.  She says that spending holidays together is too much, and they need to be separate.  She knew we did that early on, and I told her that early on it\u2019s how we did things. She has always been okay with it.  Her and my daughter get along great and she does with my ex as well so this is kind of out of left field - but she has made it clear things will change. Some of it I get, other stuff (certain things especially) I won\u2019t budge on.  She says I\u2019m choosing my ex( I think I\u2019m choosing my daughter).  Am I the AH?

I actually don\u2019t know how reasonable this one is. You don\u2019t go into how frequently you see your daughter currently. You say a few days or even a night, so it sounds sporadic.

It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re currently doing 50/50 custody, so really this might just be your fianc\u00e9 asking for a schedule for your random couple of days a month.

I don\u2019t agree that one weekend a month is enough time with a child, but some changes would have to happen if dad gets remarried. If he doesn\u2019t want anything to change, he should not get married or date. If things change, it is DADs fault for choosing a new partner, not the new partners fault. He should stay single if he doesn\u2019t want to impact the kid.", "Run away before she ruins your relationship with your daughter. NTA.

Please put your child first. Your gf\u2019s issues with your kid and her demands for limitations on your ability to actually parent will only grow especially if two have have kids.  Over time her issues will almost assuredly become a serious barrier to you being an involved father and this will have huge impact on your daughter.", "I've got an amicable 50/50 (but flexible) arrangement with my ex, and my fiancee is not only 100% on board with it, but comments during our \"off\" time on how much they miss the kids, and my kids adore my fiancee and often ask to spend time with them without me (and both kids enthusiastically took part in proposing, which made my fiancee cry). You and your daughter deserve someone who wants both of you.", "if your ex had anything happen to her, youd suddenly have the child full time. dont date a parent if you're not prepared to possibly be around a child 24/7, you are a package deal and absolutely right about putting your daughter first.", "You want your child to be with you more than she is now, and your fianc\u00e9e wants the complete opposite.

Very happy and secure in the co-parenting relationship you have worked out with your ex.  And very much in love with your daughter.  But you also seem alarmingly chill with your fiance's requests.  Not in agreement.  But not horrified she made them.  I understand this came out of left field.  But honestly, the second someone asks you not simply to prioritize a date night, but to reduce your entire RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR CHILD.... Do you really think if your ex was dating a new guy right now, and he asked her to take her daughter only one weekend a month, she would have hesitated to flip the fuck out on him??", "See, honestly, that's not an issue nor is the concern about holidays. The issue is her saying 'one weekend is enough'. That's a GIANT glaring red flag. \n\nBut, this is reddit, so I doubt many will say this, but after you dump the fiancee you really should set up a better visitation schedule because what's going to happen when your ex or you meet another person (or in your case, again).

They can make claims about abuse or drug-use. Whether that's true or not, it has to be investigated so CPS is involved. They can go after you for child support and claim arrears. You could lose decision making responsibility in your child's life. If the matter goes to court, both parties will waste all their savings on lawyers and ultimately the child is the one to suffer. It may take years to clear up in court and by that time the child is grown, they will resent you for putting them through it.\n\nPlease speak to a family law lawyer ASAP.
