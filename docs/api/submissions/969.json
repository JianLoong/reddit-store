What a waste of tuition and of a seat that could be occupied by someone who wants to learn something.  There are others in this room who clearly want to be here.  \n\nThe professor is also a bit of an AH for not exerting any control and to where a student has to speak up and do his job.

This is college - you are paying to be there to learn, not to hear a group of disrespectful students purposely being loud in class.", "Nta, and just bc most pple dnt pay attention doesn't mean that there isn't someone paying attention.

If no one pays attention in that class, then everyone is being disrespectful. \n\nGood on you for standing up for the prof and everyone who wants to learn.", "NTA. Though that prof needs to grow a spine.", "NTA, but it wasn't your responsibility; the professor should have acted, not you.", "NTA. It was the three girls talking through a lecture that were being rude.

Why? \n\n*  That group of girls for being disruptive and disrespectful\n\n*  The professor for not having the moxie to deal with the girls himself.

Them for talking in class and disrupting it, you for going to class high and only going to get the assignment. Your prof is r a kindergarten teacher, he\u2019s expected to teach adults.
