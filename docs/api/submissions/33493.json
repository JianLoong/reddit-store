I think many others in this post have made the same point about labor laws, owner may be justified but its easier for everyone if they follow the law.", "\"Cali-\"F you over\"-ornia\" took me an embarrassingly long time to decode because I was reading it as three different words \ud83d\ude06", "You should also look into your states employment laws, depending on the state as someone else said, PTO can be seen earned income and need to be paid out. The vacation time you will also need to pay out as it is seen as compensation. \n\nI highly recommend you contact a business attorney for your state and pay them to draft an employment contract so that you can be reimbursed for training you pay for, as well as so you can keep offering the benefits you do without being taken to the cleaners of someone uses you like this again. This is why most businesses have you accrue vacation time instead of giving it out.", "TBH, it feels above Reddit's pay grade for this one. \n\nThat said, take this as a learning experience to change things for the future. Add a clause, like others said, to keep people there if paying for certs, don't give PTO until after probation period, etc. \n\nAs scummy as some may think it is for your employee to do that, we also need to keep in mind that businesses don't have a sense of loyalty or obligation - outside the laws requirements - that most employees feel or are expected to feel toward a company. Not all places are this way, and you may be one of those owners that does reciprocate the loyalty, but it is a reality we can never forget.", ">Yes, thank you! This is definitely on the to do list over this break and before I re-hire for this position.\n\nOh man. How did you avoid getting scammed like this before? Because, let me tell you, you are extremely generous.", "Your system would better benefit from either basing the amount of pto provided on how long they\u2019ve been employed ( like their full amount of possible pto becomes available after 1 year of employment. So that you still aren\u2019t obligated to pay out when they quit since it isn\u2019t earned.) I\u2019d still let new employees take unpaid TO up to the amount of max pto days if they wanted/needed.", "We had an employee who did the exact same thing and they fired her for not giving proper notice so she couldn\u2019t take her vacation days. Apparently in the handbook they had a clause that you couldn\u2019t quit on PTO or PTO didn\u2019t count towards the two week notice and you had to give two weeks notice to get paid out for your PTO.", "Do check because these may not qualify as \"earned\" - Georgia is not as employee friendly as many states (and in this case I do not think you owe them morally if you don't owe them legally).", "Sounds like OP paid for them to gain vocational skills and then didn't pay for the classes or stay long enough for OP to get any value for the investment. Technically, in the legal matter, you are correct. The employee didn't take advantage of him since OP didn't want to be like every other employer, but thanks to being a shitty employee, now hopeful OP will protect himself.", "Agree with this", "Yes.  Perhaps you don't understand what \"take advantage\" means.  They absolutely took advantage of the law that protects the employee.  Fire this lazy, good for nothin freeloader, and needs to deal with the consequences.  The small business owners take the hit for this behavior.  They don't \"make money\" off of people like this.  They lose money.  It costs them.  If you have never had a company of any size, then you will defend the employee. Sure. But being on the side of the person who took all of his PTO...  seriously? says more about ... well.  nuff said.", "Yeah. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, in GA, the most you can say is \u201cno I would not hire this employee again.\u201d  Don\u2019t think we\u2019re allowed to trash them. Could be wrong. \n\nBut good on ya for being the bigger man. Good luck filling the role.", "Of course, they didn't intend to work the next two weeks. Nobody was working the next two weeks.", "Except they were. The employee put in their two weeks notice, meaning they were going to be an employee the next two weeks. OP decided they didn't want to treat them like an employee for the next two weeks. If your boss decides you're no longer an employee, that means you're fired.", "Then the worker should be eligible for unemployment benefits, on top of the 2 week vacation pay", "Thank you. I did pay them for the few days of vacation they took before giving their notice of course, but the two weeks of pay while not having to work at all seems like a reach.", "I would say it's morally wrong to cut someone who has given notice. If I saw a company do that? They are getting blindsided at the worst possible time when i leave. No notice", "This situation is slightly different, bit I digress.", "too bad you don't understand labor law and I do.", "Yes, thank you. It\u2019s definitely time to have to set some firmer rules.", "If the employer was stupid enough, as appears to be here, to not have a clause in the employment contract about needing to reimburse recent for company-paid training or supplies if they resign within x number of months, that's on the employer.\n\n> Technically, in the legal matter, you are correct. \n\nWhich, in this case, is the only 'correct' that matters.  Labour law trumps 'but that's not nice.'", "All states, you are only allowed to say if they are eligible to be rehired, while you can say more, say anything negative can put you in legal trouble. Technically saying good things could too but who is going to sue you for praising them?", "No this is called mutual termination. The employee giving two weeks notice doesn\u2019t have to be accepted by the employer. The employee is actually quitting on the day they turn in their two week notice. The option is with the employer if they want the employee to work those two weeks. If not, then it\u2019s considered mutual termination.", "Check the labor laws, you may be legally required to pay the remaining days. This why most employers do not give PTO right away. Some will after 90 days, some 6 months, and where I am, it's a full year before any paid time off is available.", "It's different in Canada but you here you have to work the day before and after a paid holiday to actually get paid for it. Some employers are lenient about it but it's up to them.\n\nPaid vacation is earned as well, base starting @ 4% of your pay witch works out to 2 weeks/year. So you can still request/take vacations but you don't get paid unless you've earned it. If you leave before taking your vacations you get paid out. Most places don't let you accrue too much either because people will save up and take 6 month vacations", "Usually if it's because the office is closed you'll be fine not paying them for those two weeks. If the office was open and it was accured time then it would definitely be wise to check labor laws, and I would double check this to be safe but since it's an office closure and you declined the two weeks notice and let them go that day my bet is you're fine.", "Kudos to you, what you think you know does not concern me. If you're willing to be legal representation for OP in case of backlash, feel free to message them! Unless you're a labor attorney with valid information, best advice is for OP to be safe and do their own research.", "An employee handbook is what you need for the future if you want to go that route. But based on the size of your business you probably don\u2019t need that. You\u2019ve got a similar vacation policy to mine it looks like, where employees have x amount of vacation days to use each year and it\u2019s a use it or lose it situation, they don\u2019t earn pto based off of hours worked and it doesn\u2019t roll over. \n\nBe mindful that putting things like this in writing solidifies them legally and would likely make you legally obligated to follow them in the future, to your benefit or detriment.", "The question was how did they take advantage, nothing wrong with what I said. If you look at it legal, no, they didn't. If you look at it like a normal human being, yes, they did.", "wrong.  you are not \"only allowed to say if they are eligible.\"", "He is allowed to speak all about his responsibilities and if he did them.  His performance, whether or not he was professional or not.  The reasons he left. you are so wrong.", "You're misunderstanding mutual termination. \n\nA mutual termination, as the name suggests, has to be mutual. It's a mutual understanding that has to be discussed between the two. \n\nOP makes no mention of the employee discussing and agreeing to this, they're also posting in AITA about it and the employee seems to have meticulously chosen when their two weeks notice would be. \n\nThis leads me all to believe this doesn't count as a mutual termination.", "Depends if it's allocated or accrued.  If you accrue you're liable for anything you haven't earned if you use a bunch up front, but unused gets paid out.", "I already did. Law says no, he doesn't have to.", "A whole year, would that mean if I started on the 1st Jan 2024 then I couldn't take a holiday for the 2024 Christmas season?\n\nThat seems horrible tbh.", "How does one 'take advantage' of something they've been given?  Their terms of employment included PTO and paid vacation days.  It's not 'taking advantage' to expect an agreement to be finalized.\n\nAgain, we're not talking about a friendship, we're talking about an employment contract.", "When it comes to employment reference, not personal reference, yeah, you are only allowed to say if they are eligible for rehire. Saying more gets you into the possibility of getting sued.", "You are wrong"]}
