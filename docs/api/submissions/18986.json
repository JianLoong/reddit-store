Your girlfriend's mother could've talked to her own daughter and worked out whatever is going on between them. Instead she chose to be sneaky and send you a text asking for images.

Which is your mutual child, and your relationship, before you join her mother in non contact land, where you see your child only at the weekend.", "Sorry YTA\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here.\n\n1. When you share a child with someone you should _always_ make sure you're on the same page. How would you feel if she signed your kid up for some religion you don't believe in, or a dangerous activity. Maybe a major surgery. Do you want to be left out of decisions for your child? Neither does she.\n\n2. There seems to be missing info here about the MIL. Why does your gf not get along with her mother to the point she doesn't want to send pictures? Either the MIL is someone your whole family should keep their distance from or your gf needs help. It's in your new families best interest to figure out which one.\n\n3. If the MIL is indeed not someone yall should be spending time with take that \"it's her grandchild she has a right\" out of your mouth right now. I'm not sure where you live but some US states there's grandparents rights- most of the time they have to prove either the child is unsafe or there is a pre-existing relationship. If you want to pull this nonsense a d have your child spend time with this person and then you change your mind later- she might be able to _sue for visitation_ and successfully get it.

Do you have any fear that that woman is going to do something nasty with those pictures? Sell them? Distribute them?\n\nI don't know what she did to your gf, maybe you do, which makes it worse.\n\nIt's better to be single than to have partner who believes you're garbage, and looks down on your feelings and opinions. It's okay to admit you messed up. It's not okay to ignore all the YTA judgments here and pretend you're still right. You're a father now.

A family dinner absolutely is, but they still do these dinners.  So its murky. Point is, OP isn\u2019t an asshole for seeing the photos as okay.
