We've been engaged and planning the wedding for about two years now. Part of the reason we've had such a long engagement is that he's Irish Catholic and I'm English protestant (Anglican). He's not remotely religious (I am though), but his family are very devout. His grandma (who he is extremely close to) in particular really wanted him to get married in their local church.\n\nAnyway, we went to speak to the priest about it and he told us it's possible for us to marry without me converting, you just need to ask the bishop for permission, however, at the same time he asked if I'd be interested in converting. My family history is that my dad's family is Catholic (from Liverpool), but my mum's family is Anglican.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I thought about it and decided to do the conversion course and convert. It started a year and a half ago and I finished it this April.\n\nA few months ago I was at home for a big family BBQ and a cousin on my dad's side (who was never Christened or baptised) was telling me she was thinking about starting to go to church etc. I started telling her about this course I'd done (which is also for people new to the church) and my experience of it etc.\n\nI have two aunts on my mum's side, and one of them (who was hammered at this point), overheard and said, \"You're a catholic now? Isn't it bad enough you're marrying one?\"\n\nI was totally speechless for a second, and my dad's very much a conflict-resolution sort of person so he tried to make a joke out of things by saying, \"Like mother like daughter\", but I'm not a conflict-resolution sort of person so I asked her what the hell she meant by that.\n\nShe started ranting about the 70s and my mum had to almost physically pull her inside. It's worth noting that her husband, her other sister, her husband and their kids were all there (all adults), but not one of them said anything to shut her up. In fact they were actively excusing her by saying things like \"She's just had too much to drink.\" And my other aunt even asked me again why I'd converted in quite a harsh voice.\n\nI didn't answer but I did say that if they felt so strongly about it then they can just not come to the wedding. My dad managed to change the conversation at that point (again with a joke, bless him), and the subject didn't come up again)\n\nThe day after I was talking to my mum about it, who was also trying to keep the peace by saying that it's just a touchy subject for them (it fucking isn't, they're just dicks). I told her I didn't care if it was touchy, they couldn't say that sort of thing and I was uninviting that side of the family from the wedding.\n\nI think they thought I was joking but the invites went out last week and they're furious that I've cut them out of the wedding over \"a bit of banter.\"\n\nAITA? It was maybe a bit severe not to invite any of them, but not one of them stood up to my aunt and disagreed.", "created_utc": 1695819460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tjvic/aita_for_uninviting_half_my_family_from_my_wedding/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was Episcopalian (people sometimes call it English Catholic here) Married back in 85 wife is Lutheran. Married in a Lutheran Church never found the time change over. Attend Lutheran Church services about 99 percent. About 3 times a year attend Episcopal mass. NTA. Edit. Becareful what you say. A friend years ago was Methodist and marrying a gal who was Catholic. Friends mother said she will never see any of her children get married in a Catholic church. She died a week before friends wedding of a Heart Attack .", "NTA\n\nYou can invite or not invite whoever who want to your own wedding\n\nThough I do think its a little bit excessive to also disinvite the family members who didn't say anything. Maybe they just didn't see the point of arguing with a drunk person, that's just spewing hate and can't be reasoned with? Just a thought ..", "NTA.\n\n>It's bad enough you're marrying one of them.\n\n**Let's just imagine your aunt had been referring to your black/Muslim/Jewish fianc\u00e9 here.

You should have people at your wedding who support you and your future husband.\n\nObviously your aunts don't.  That said, I'm curious as to why you converted.  You say your husband isn't religious so you being a religious protestant doesn't sound problematic for him.  Do you feel a stronger affinity to Catholicism?  If this is too nosy or too personal I apologize.", "Send it via mail too.

But unhealthy, I don't think so.", "I can't see it changing any time soon, there's war in some parts every year but it's not really about religion", "It's also unhelpful.   \n\n\nI know that Dawkinites have very simpleminded beliefs and a very hard time understanding the cultural and personal significance of religion, but there are FAR more interesting questions about a faith than \"is it literal, measurable truth?\"   \n\n\nA conflict based on OP's desire to convert and historical conflicts involving her family of origin and the family into which she is marrying can't be meaningfully reduced to \"imaginary friends\".   \n\n\nIf you can't be bothered to understand the topic well enough to be helpful, then do us all a favor and be quiet."]}
