They arrest sometimes for suspended license, meaning the person did something bad with a car or has a very long history of not doing something they are supposed to. So what did the guy do to get his license suspended? Did he drive drunk? Flee the scene of an accident? Run someone over? Or does he just have a history of not taking care of the things he is supposed to, like having insurance, renewing his license on time, paying child support, or? If it was for one of the former reasons, I would say N T A. People who drive drunk or leave the scene of an accident or hurt someone with a car deserve what happens to them. If it was a paperwork issue, maybe not so much. \n\nThe guy was clearly on his way to work. That says to me that he is trying to pull himself out of a hole.

I\u2019m a former public defender and I represented so many people who were caught driving without a license or on a suspended license. They get caught in a cycle. That becomes nearly impossible to break free from. \n\nFirst, they get a traffic ticket for a minor violation like having a broken tail light. They live in poverty and are unable to pay the fine. They get their license suspended for failing to pay the ticket. They live in a city with a poor public transportation system and have no way to work unless they drive. \n\nBecause they live in poverty they also live in a high crime area where the local police tend to make a disproportionately high number of traffic stops looking for drugs and people with active warrants all under the guise of a legitimate traffic stop. Therefore, they get pulled over again because the cops ran their plate at a traffic light and see they have a suspended license. They are arrested and have a charge for driving on a suspended license with comes with the possibility of six months in jail and a hefty fine. \n\nThe court rarely sends people to jail for driving without/on a suspended license, but have no problem dishing out the big fines. They can\u2019t get their license reinstated until they pay all their fines and pay a large \u201creinstatement fee\u201d to the BMV. They also have to carry expensive high risk insurance. If they ever want to get their license back they have to work. But to get to work they have to drive\u2026\u2026..and it just goes on and on.

Where I am, if there is more than $500 worth of damage, the police should be contacted. It doesn't take much to rack up $500 worth of damage", "It depends on where you live. Where we live, the first thing that insurance is going to ask about when you go to file a claim is \u201ccan we have a copy of the police report\u201d as the police report often determines who is at fault.

However (having worked in insurance), I can tell you that any person on a policy that does not have a valid license is typically not covered in the event of an accident. So a claim can be denied if the driver does not have a license with the exception of a permit with a licensed driver in the front passenger seat. So OP would need the police report (more than likely depending on her adjuster) to use her own policy to cover damages if the claim was denied.", "Again, that depends entirely on where you live.
