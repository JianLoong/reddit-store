If he's driving without a driver's license, he's most likely uninsured and may have given you false information. He's the reason laws are made in the first place. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.", "NTA. That insurance card was fake. Insurance companies do NOT write policies for unlicensed drivers. And if the policy was someone else's, all that person has to do is say the dude didn't have permission to be driving it and the insurance wouldn't cover it.", "NTA. I'd like to believe he would have done the right thing and paid for your damages. But, if he's already breaking the law by driving without a license, chances are doing the right thing is not his thing.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, you're supposed to file a police report in any sort of car accident. You weren't in the wrong, you were rear-ended. Despite how lightly it might've been, it's still an accident. You did a good thing. He tried to guilt you into letting him go. Yes, it might've been true all that he says, but you have to make sure to cover all bases.\n\nAnd yeah, apparently he's not even supposed to be driving lol. Anyone who's not supposed to be driving should not be driving for a reason. You did yourself a fair one and saved other people from possibly getting injured/screwed over.", "NTA - But you're gonna live with that. Technically you were right, technically he had no business being on the road. But depending on what happens to him that is indeed going to be the cost of what you describe as \"very limited surface damage\" \n\nBut he was playing a losing game, all it would take is expired tags, a poor lane change, a California stop, what have you, any traffic infraction would land this guy in the same place. \n\nThat's a hard one bud.", "NTA\n\nIf he is driving without a license that means one of two things. He either couldn't pass the test to get one, or he had it taken away. Also I don't know where you live, but in a lot of places you cannot get any kind of insurance other than parking insurance without a license. \n\nIn most cases licenses are taken for dangerous driving infractions. Things like DUIs, or excessive moving violations. In some cases it is revoked or suspended due to failure to make child support payments, but that is extremely uncommon. Though the fact that he rear ended you strongly suggests that it was most likely revoked due to unsafe driving.\n\nBottom line is that this person didn't have a license for a reason, and should not have been driving. Period.", "NTA.  He doesn't have a license for a good reason and should be arrested.", "NTA - You followed your instinct and the law.  It's not up to you to cover that guy.", "NTA.   Driving without a license...he got what he deserved", "NTA. They just take your license for giggles. They take it for thinks like reckless endangerment and DUI... which means he should not have been driving.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not sure how likely it is that he has valid insurance and no driver's license.\n\nRegardless, it is not your job to decide which lawbreakers get to skate on which laws.", "NTA.

Carriers run driving record reports and whatnot. If someone doesn't have a license, then nobody is going to issue them an Auto policy. He was probably going to give you bogus information. I've seen it happen many times.\nNTA.", "Lol NTA, that sounds like his own problem not yours", "NTA, although if it was solely your husband\u2019s advice and not something you wanted to do then there\u2019s definitely something you want to think about there.", "ESH\n\nIt is possible to be insured without a valid license.

Former Police Officer and have seen too many people wind up with having to pay for their own damage when the \"nice guy\" fails to pay for the damage they caused or wants to argue that the $3000 repaid should only be $1000. \n\nAs far as filing a police report, insurance companies will all want a report number. Police may respond to any crash call, even on private property depending on any local laws and department policy.", "Tough to make a valid ruling here. Police dont arrest for no license. They arrest sometimes for suspended license, meaning the person did something bad with a car or has a very long history of not doing something they are supposed to. So what did the guy do to get his license suspended? Did he drive drunk? Flee the scene of an accident? Run someone over? Or does he just have a history of not taking care of the things he is supposed to, like having insurance, renewing his license on time, paying child support, or? If it was for one of the former reasons, I would say N T A. People who drive drunk or leave the scene of an accident or hurt someone with a car deserve what happens to them. If it was a paperwork issue, maybe not so much. \n\nThe guy was clearly on his way to work. That says to me that he is trying to pull himself out of a hole. Maybe he dug that hole himself with his own two hands, but nevertheless he is trying. He also made no attempt to get away, but waited for the police knowing he would be arrested when they arrived. I don't think he was an evil person trying to take advantage of you. So you may have sabotaged his efforts to improve his life, just because you wanted to involve the police in a minor fender bender that could easily have been resolved with an information exchange. And if so, that would mean that Y T A. \n\nI'll let you decide which one you feel like as more info comes in.", "wait a sec?! driver doesnt have a license but has insurance?! downfall of murica. no wonder we cant make it great again. NTA.", "YTA purely because you say the damage was minimal. \n\nIf he'd totalled the car you gotta do what you gotta do.

I don't know about everywhere, but in one state I lived in, you have to report an accident to the police if there is damage over $x. I think it was $1,000 at the time? Anyway, if you aren't a mechanic or car buff, you might not realize that just a couple of dents in the right place can easily cost >$1,000. \n\nReporting it, even if the damage seems minor, is best. CYA people! I've been in a few minor accidents over the years, mostly fender benders. Call #1- police *non-emergency* line unless there are injuries or a traffic hazard, then use 911 or your country's equivalent.  Call #2- insurance.\n\nI had someone come flying out of a blind driveway and hit the side of my truck. Crumpled in a large portion of the passenger side, cab and truck bed. He not only didn't want me to call the police he didn't want me to call my insurance. He'd just pay for the repairs. Yeah, no. Not happening.\n\nNTA. He chose to drive without a license, now he has to deal with the consequences.", "I don't think \"very limited surface damage\" is worth potentially blowing someone's life up, so I'm going with the unpopular take that yeah, YTA. Worst case scenario if he was indeed scamming you is you have some unsightly scrapes on your bumper until you can afford to have it repaired. Sounds like his worst case scenario is a hell of a lot worse, with much more far-reaching consequences.", "switching information invludes drivers \u00f1icense and identity. taking photo of plate and driver and damage", "You absolutely can get insurance without a license, and in fact if your license gets suspended you typically need to prove that you have insurance in order to get it reinstated.  Also, if you finance a car your lender may require it to be insured as a condition of the note whether or not you maintain a valid driver's license.  An unlicensed driver may not be able to get a policy from one of the big companies, but there are plenty of smaller (typically crappier) insurance companies that will write those policies.", "you do not need to file a police report in minor traffic accidents.", "The police won\u2019t come if the accident occurred on private property.

OP is definitely NTA, but the whole system is fucked considering it's entirely possible Mr. No license's license was revoked due to a clerical error or an overzealous cop who saw he was in jail in the past during a traffic stop.\n\nThe US is brutal for ex-cons and the rest of it is brutal for anyone poor or minority. IMO this whole situation is going to end up needlessly hurting Mr. No license WAAAAAY more than is appropriate for what he did.\n\nI really wish our justice system was focused on rehabilitation and stopping recidivism instead of the hard-on for \"an eye for an eye\" mentality of punishment we currently have.", "Its not true at all that you cant get insurance without a license.", "He said he has insurance.", "This is actually not true.

I hit a car 2 yrs ago and we took photos of eCh other license plate, sent each other photo of dl and insurance info.
