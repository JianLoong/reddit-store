They arrest sometimes for suspended license, meaning the person did something bad with a car or has a very long history of not doing something they are supposed to. So what did the guy do to get his license suspended? Did he drive drunk? Flee the scene of an accident? Run someone over? Or does he just have a history of not taking care of the things he is supposed to, like having insurance, renewing his license on time, paying child support, or? If it was for one of the former reasons, I would say N T A. People who drive drunk or leave the scene of an accident or hurt someone with a car deserve what happens to them. If it was a paperwork issue, maybe not so much. \n\nThe guy was clearly on his way to work. That says to me that he is trying to pull himself out of a hole.

I\u2019m a former public defender and I represented so many people who were caught driving without a license or on a suspended license. They get caught in a cycle. That becomes nearly impossible to break free from. \n\nFirst, they get a traffic ticket for a minor violation like having a broken tail light. They live in poverty and are unable to pay the fine. They get their license suspended for failing to pay the ticket. They live in a city with a poor public transportation system and have no way to work unless they drive. \n\nBecause they live in poverty they also live in a high crime area where the local police tend to make a disproportionately high number of traffic stops looking for drugs and people with active warrants all under the guise of a legitimate traffic stop. Therefore, they get pulled over again because the cops ran their plate at a traffic light and see they have a suspended license. They are arrested and have a charge for driving on a suspended license with comes with the possibility of six months in jail and a hefty fine. \n\nThe court rarely sends people to jail for driving without/on a suspended license, but have no problem dishing out the big fines. They can\u2019t get their license reinstated until they pay all their fines and pay a large \u201creinstatement fee\u201d to the BMV. They also have to carry expensive high risk insurance. If they ever want to get their license back they have to work. But to get to work they have to drive\u2026\u2026..and it just goes on and on.

When I got it fixed, the other driver\u2019s insurance told me that had it been slightly more money, the car would have been considered a total loss.\n\nIt\u2019s often not that the car isn\u2019t fixable, but that the cost is higher than insurance wants to pay.", "Depends on where you are. Where I am, if there is more than $500 worth of damage, the police should be contacted. It doesn't take much to rack up $500 worth of damage", "It depends on where you live. Where we live, the first thing that insurance is going to ask about when you go to file a claim is \u201ccan we have a copy of the police report\u201d as the police report often determines who is at fault.

I was hit on private property. The police came. They won't do an official report here, but will do a receipt of accident I think it was called? Like a report.", "You\u2019re right, you can get insurance without a valid driver\u2019s license. However (having worked in insurance), I can tell you that any person on a policy that does not have a valid license is typically not covered in the event of an accident. So a claim can be denied if the driver does not have a license with the exception of a permit with a licensed driver in the front passenger seat. So OP would need the police report (more than likely depending on her adjuster) to use her own policy to cover damages if the claim was denied.", "Again, that depends entirely on where you live. Which is why I explicitly said that. I also didn't say that you can't get insurance. I said that without a valid driver's license, in many places you are only eligible for parking insurance that covers things like theft, and fire. It usually doesn't cover driving collision insurance.", "If you're going to make that kind of claim, then please provide evidence of it being common to lose your license for a \"minor traffic fine\". \n\nAs where I live the only way they will take your license for outstanding fines, is if your fines total at *least* $2000-3000, which is in no way \"minor\". Even in the instance of a DUI, they usually won't take your license for a first time infraction.", "Ok or he got a parking ticket that he couldn\u2019t pay and that got his license suspended. We cannot know why this person didn\u2019t have a license, a lot of what I\u2019ve been reading on this post has boiled down to \u201cWell he\u2019s poor so he deserves it.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re claiming but do you really trust the courts cause I sure as hell don\u2019t.", "If OP says the damage is minimal, the car isn\u2019t totaled. Do you know what that means? Doesn\u2019t seem like you do.", "arnt you heartless.\n\nThe joy that ozzes from your reply at the thought of some guy is in jail is revolting.", "not true...", "My blind uncle had his own car and car insurance. He often hired college kids to dive him around for work or whatever, and they often didn't have cars of their own.", "They're not saying driving without a license is legal - they're saying you can buy insurance on a vehicle without having a valid license.", "Yeah I'm a lawyer and do coverage work, among other things.  It's so funny how confidently wrong people can be.", "I doubt it says that.", "That's just not true.", "That's typically not true.", "Lack of a valid driver's license is not a typical exclusion for liability coverage in an auto policy, nor is breaking the law (with the exception of intentionally causing injury with your car, that is excluded).", "Not having a license is typically not grounds for denying liability coverage on an auto policy.\n\nEdit: also committing a crime is also not typically grounds for denial unless you are intentionally trying to injure someone with the car.  Hitting someone while dui or fleeing from the police, for example, are covered.", "true.... everything i said has an assumption that it took place in usa.\n\nIn colombia they have a rule that every accident needs to have police come and write a report,..cant even move cars from blocking the street for simple fender benders.", "This is wrong.", "OP isn't a mechanic. The only way to ensure the damage was minimal is by taking it to one.", "What's minimal?\n\nWhat about hidden damages?\n\nThere are lots of ways for a car to be totalled", ">arnt\n\nWhat?\n\n>ozzes\n\nWhat?", "I dunno how it is elsewhere, but where I live, the government website outright states that you cannot purchase vehicle insurance for road usage without a valid driver\u2019s license. I can\u2019t imagine this isn\u2019t the case in most places, honestly\u2026.\n\nYou may be able to get parked car insurance, otherwise called storage insurance, or whatever it\u2019s called where you live. But it is what it sounds like - it only covers parked cars. Seeing as the car was not parked, the insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it in this situation.\n\nWhere I live, even if you have obtained insurance while you had a valid license, and your license has been revoked, your insurance company can refuse to cover the damages incurred while your license was invalid, and you can be held personally liable.\n\nIn OP\u2019s case, since it\u2019s quite likely there will be insurance issues, if they want to seek damages, they\u2019re going to *need* a police report from the incident. And it is far better to get one immediately and not give the other driver a chance to go home and cook up a baloney story about what happened.\n\nBottom line, 90% of the time if a driver hit you, it\u2019s because they were being negligent. You can\u2019t waste time worrying how they\u2019re going to get themselves through a situation they put themselves in. Always file a police report in a motor vehicle accident. Always.", "Because the driver in this instance was unlicensed, and the policy likely would not have covered this unlicensed driver?", "dont worry about it.\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "If your license is suspended for not having car insurance, how are you supposed to get your license back without buying insurance?\n\nWorked for the DMV in Florida for years - you have to show proof of insurance to clear license suspensions all the time.", "not true,.. but even if it is.. the process of claims does not change. your insurance handles it the way they want to handle it...getting the guy arrested is probably a disadvantage to anyone seeking to get any payment from the guy.", "Bingo. Driving without a license voided his policy, he would absolutely not be covered.", "You at the DMV receive their insurance. You\u2019re not on the end where they purchase it. \n\nIn that case, they would likely have to go through extra steps with their insurance company in order to obtain insurance based on the assumption that they will immediately reinstate their license upon proof of insurance. Some companies may require them to provide the dated license and proof of the reason it was suspended, and they would likely require the driver to follow up within a certain period of time to confirm that the license is valid. OR, like I said, they could simply choose not to follow up and then just not cover damages should the still-unlicensed driver get in an accident (ie for the purposes of damages like the ones OP obtained, they don\u2019t actually have valid insurance coverage so long as their license isn\u2019t valid, even if they\u2019re paying for it).", "look it up... just not true\n\nquote:\nWhile your car insurance won't be canceled automatically just because your license is suspended, you still can't drive legally. Your car is insured.\n\nSome states suspend your license without warning for parling tickets... i found out my license was suspended when i got pulled over for registration being late. Still insured the whole time.", "I never once said it was easy.\n\nYou said you cannot buy insurance without a valid license. I, as a DMV clerk, routinely took insurance purchased by unlicensed drivers to reinstate their license.\n\nEdit - lol did you seriously block me over civil disagreement about *car insurance*?", "Let me be clearer. It is policy where I LIVE is that a valid driver\u2019s license be provided for auto insurance to be obtained. I\u2019m not assuming that, it is literally stated on the government\u2019s website. Obviously it is subject to interpretation in extremely specific circumstances like the ones I have already clearly outlined. \n\nA driver\u2019s license suspended for *not having insurance* would be considered, in this context, to the insurance company, to be valid as it can be validated immediately upon purchasing the insurance.\n\nThere\u2019s always someone in the comments who wants to be pedantic. \n\nThe point is clear that if this guy is DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE, it is not a good bet to rely on his having insurance, or his insurance covering damages.\n\n*Edit in response to your edit:*\n\n*\u2026.. no, I didn\u2019t? Wtf? Feel free to reply?*", "Look up sr-22 insurance"]}
