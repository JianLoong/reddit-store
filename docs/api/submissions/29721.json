We\u2019ve been living together for two years. She is a single mom of a toddler. When we first moved in together the apartment was only in her name and she let me live with her. I was finishing dental assisting school and couldn\u2019t qualify for an apartment on my own. I still paid half the rent and utilities. After graduating and getting a job I became an official added roommate to the lease last year.  \n\n\nI make a lot of money for my age so when my sister was struggling to pay her half of the rent when her job cut her hours significantly it was a no brainer to start paying more. I could easily afford all the rent so covering another 25% is nothing. Plus I love her and my niece. My sister has no help whatsoever from the father so I help her as much as I can. He works under the table so he doesnt get his wages garnished for child support. I have watched her struggle to afford daycare and food for her baby so I also help her with that.  \n\n\nTwo days ago my sister sits me down and tells me she has news. She\u2019s pregnant. My jaw dropped. I ask who the dad is and she starts crying. I didn\u2019t expect her to say her deadbeat baby daddy\u2026  \n\n\nI was shocked and she continued on her \u201cexplanation\u201d: she saw a girl commenting under his posts and she went on her page and saw they had taken pictures at the same place at the same time. The girl also posted him for his birthday weeks later saying \u201chappy birthday to my fiance\u201d. She messaged her letting her know hes a deadbeat and got blocked. Then her baby daddy called her saying shes a crazy bitch and that led to them getting a hotel room and they slept with each other\u2026 all to prove some point to his fiance that hes not loyal and she can have him whenever she wants because she sent her proof after they slept together but the fiance stayed with him\u2026  \n\n\nAs she\u2019s telling me this story I just sit there upset. I started asking her if she went to the doctor and how far along is she. She said she did stop by PP and got a scan, shes nine weeks. We live in a blue state so abortion is legal here. I told my sister that I wasnt going to be resigning the lease unless she got an abortion. She looked at me with so much disgust and started crying harder. She called me an evil bitch and said Im a horrible person for making her choose between her baby or having housing. I told her with her hours now she cant afford even half the rent let alone the daycare she splits between me, our dad, and aunt so to understand the position she\u2019s putting me in since the responsibility is falling on me.   \n\n\nShe told our family and they\u2019re pissed saying Im being heartless to even ask her that and that I shouldn\u2019t punish her and if I should sign at least 6 months so she can get her shit together since 5 weeks isnt alot of time. I said no, she\u2019s ungrateful for all the help Ive done so Im out. They\u2019re saying Im an asshole since when I didn\u2019t qualify she let me live with her (even though I paid half).", "created_utc": 1698354281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h6mrq/aita_for_refusing_to_resign_a_lease_weeks_before/", "score": 5283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hate when family tries to spend other family members money.  Tell your family that they can co-sign for your sister and pitch in on the rent since they are so adamant about it.\n\nYou aren't forcing your sister to get an abortion, you just aren't going to live with her if she has another kid.   The kids are not your responsibility and you should not have to take care of them.\n\nDead beat dad's future wife should know that if he cannot afford child support, they will get it out of her wages.  When they get married, the courts take into consideration the household income, so she will be on the hook for both kids (if in the US).", "NTA\n\nShe gets to choose to sleep with a deadbeat and raise his baby.\n\nYou get to choose to move out.\n\nSeems fair.\n\nYour family who think she needs support can jump in at any time and pay her rent.", "NTA, the family can support and house her since they are so concerned. There is no need for you to carry on supporting someone who is taking an advantage of you and has no intention of becoming independent.", "Nta\n\n\"I can have your deadbeat fiance cum in me any time i want\" is NOT a flex.", "NTA\n\nShe's literally FAFO.   She can't support herself but wants you to be her financial slave.  Run, do not walk.   She's never going to learn and it's not your responsibility to support her crazy level of stupid/stupid level of crazy. \n\nGood luck!", "Your sister has a kid with someone that doesn't support the kid and went and got knocked up by the same loser? Holy shit. Leave. \n\nNTA", "Well, this is messy.\n\nMy first thought is that a lot of people have to choose between housing and having a baby. Most of us do it before pregnancy but that doesn't matter here. What really bothers me is that your sister is not emotionally stable enough to raise children by herself: she had unprotected sex with a man to prove a point, and he happens to be the same man who refuses to support a child he already has.\n\nYou may have been a bit harsh, but so is reality. I'm going to suggest that you point her to counseling ASAP, and then to court to get court-order child support. If he works under the table, they can still order him to pay. \n\nAnd ask her plainly, how does she plan to support two children? As any parent will tell you, they get more expensive later on.\n\nYou've been a good sister. You didn't have the right to issue an ultimatum, but you do have the right to decide where and how you live. You're well within your rights to say, \"I do not want to live in a house with another baby, and I cannot spend more on you than I am already.\" I have a feeling that with all this going on in your life, you aren't saving as much as you should, and that will make you less secure later on. Don't compromise on that. You're the only one who can do it.\n\nThe way you handled this was flawed, but you're not the one bringing a child into the world that you cannot afford to feed. The cause of this mess is your sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA!  My sister has a shitty baby daddy too. We all helped her. She ended up sleeping with him one time and got pregnant again. We helped with the second baby. She then got with a different shit bag and got pregnant again. She refused to abort or adopt out even though she can\u2019t take care of the two she has. \n\nAt that point I stepped back the amount I helped as she clearly wasn\u2019t going to stop.  Honestly she got pregnant a fourth time with the same shit bag. \n\nSome people never learn and while \u201cabort or I won\u2019t sign the lease\u201d is super harsh\u2026 she needs to see now that you won\u2019t sacrifice your life for her choices.", "Thank you for refusing to fund this train wreck.  NTA", "NTA.  Your message might have gone down a little easier if you just said you would not continue to support rather than abort or no support (even if it is essentially the same message), but you are under no obligation to support someone who repeatedly makes poor choices and bad decisions.  If she has this baby whose to say she won\u2019t stupidly sleep  bc with the jerk again in a couple of years and make baby #3.  She doesn\u2019t sound intelligent enough to be a good mother.", "NTA- your sister banged a dead beat and has a toddler with him, then gets jealous that he\u2019s with someone else and inserts herself into his life to show how scummy she really is, then gets knocked up again to prove a point that the deadbeat baby daddy isn\u2019t worth anything to his fianc\u00e9? OP, move out and stop supporting your sister. She\u2019s obsessed with her baby daddy and needs some therapy. Like damn reading this reminded me of an episode of Jerry Springer", "NTA \n\ntbh, its a reach, but it sounds like your sister was mad that he was willing to propose to someone else and purposely got pregnant just to sabotage. Why else would you meet up and go at it unprotected again with a deadbeat? Either she expected you to take up the baggage or she has zero self-control. \n\nThe abortion comment was kind of a AH move, but it\u2019s understandable why you made the suggestion. Finally, the other family members should pay if it\u2019s so cruel to leave her in the dust", "NTA. She\u2019s not really getting her shit together at this stage enough to get back on her feet on her own with having a toddler, and now being pregnant.   You would be footing the bill for most of her costs, and you\u2019re not even the father.", "Nta- your family is welcome to step up and financially support and house her.", "Run. You are NTA, start running. Because if you are there when that second child arrives you can say goodbye to ever getting out again. You think the emotional blackmail is bad now?", "NTA. Abortion or housing is an easy choice. If she chooses to have another baby she can live with one of the relatives that was mad at you.\n\nNTA for telling her to get an abortion. It is the only thing your sister should consider and you bringing it up was the right thing to do.", "NTA. If she\u2019s mature enough to put herself in a situationship, she\u2019s mature enough to handle the consequences. One \u201coops\u201d is something, but two? Come on. Living in fairyland", "Your sister went through all that, to get revenge on this guy, or to try to get him back, or to break up his engagement.  \n\nYou might want to consider moving out early, and packing up things you can't replace easily early.  **If she will go through this kind of scheming, to try to break up her ex's new relationship, she might consider some schemes to hurt you,** when you won't keep on paying for her support.", "If she's hinging on you giving her free housing so she can raise a kid, NTA. Don't bring a child into poverty. Don't have children unless you can provide for them, and raise them. I might be downvoted for this but I don't care.", "NTA move out and stop giving her any money. Tell your sister you love her but you can\u2019t keep putting your life on hold for her & her children. Tell her you will always be their aunt & she needs to get child support from the  baby daddy. \n\nTell any family member who complains you are abandoning her, that  she can move in with them!", "NTA.  You are not required to support her dumb decisions.\n\nYou need to protect yourself though.  Remember to give written notice to your landlord if required in your lease.  This may be more than the 5 weeks you have left, so double check.\n\nAlso, be prepared for the worst outcome.  If you leave but your sister holds over, and does not sign a lease on her own and pay rent, your landlord may have to name both of you in the eviction.  This is because you are both on the lease.  \"Joint and severable liability,\" is the legal term.  You need to have a new lease signed before that happens, as just being named in an eviction proceeding can get you on a hidden blacklist you have no right to correct.\n\nAlso, since you are joint tenants, the landlord will be able to sue both of you for the damages and lost rent.  And your sister has no assets, while you do.  So you are going to be the main target.  It is in your best interest to get her moved out before she discovers this.  \n\nFor some reason, Deadbeats all seem to have some secret network where they share information about how to screw over the non-deadbeats in their lives.  You are going to have to hope she is not motivated to milk the situation for everything she can and leave you on the hook for her actions.", "I just don\u2019t understand how she even got in the mood to bang the dude who doesn\u2019t take care of her kid. NTA", "Tell your family they can support her, since they seem so anxious for you to do it.\n\nShe's choosing to have a second baby with the deadbeat dad of her first baby. That is HER choice, not yours. You are not obligated to continue subsidizing her.\n\nAs to what she did for you, you paid half and it was as much for her own benefit as it was for yours. And even if it wasn't, you've made up for it since then.\n\nNTA. Stand your ground.", "NTA. It's tough for her to hear but an abortion is the most practical thing for her situation. She's setting herself and her other child up for failure with her selfish decisions.", "NTA and ask all those people that are calling you an asshole to pay her rent and her utilities and her daycare for not 1 but 2 babies that her sorry ass baby daddy won't help with. Suggesting abortion may not have been the best thing to do, but you have every right to be pissed and every right to move out and stop paying anything for your sister.", "To all the people commenting that she should at least re-sign the lease for six months.... yeah sure just re-sign the lease and THEN force your 8 month pregnant sister to move and find new accommodations, this totally makes sense   /s.... Get out while you still can and definitely NTA!", "NTA. \n\nThis is your sister's mess due to her poor decision-making. You're not responsible or obligated to keep providing for her. Other family members are more than free to open their homes up to her or subsidize her living costs.\n\nYou were harsh, but not an ahole.", "NTA. If you can't house yourself, you have no business having more children. Abort the pregnancy , or live with the consequences. Geez. The people here acting like suggesting abortion is evil\u2026", "NTA.  You've been paying 75% of the rent and she got cozy enough to get pregnant again, assuming you'd keep it up.  And you're not going to.", "NTA. She's an idiot with no common sense. You have no obligation or responsibility to finance her ridiculous life choices.", "Shes stupid", "Info: what the fuck is an Irish twin?", "NTA\n\nI see this sort of tale repeated again and again - people get with the wrong people, repeat the mistake with same or similar, children keep popping out, and yet - they expect everybody else to help them handle the problems they create.\n\nDo understand this is cutting ties with her and rest of family, or you'll be constantly be guilted and pressured for cash.", "NTA - your sister played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.\nI do feel bad for your niece .", "NTA\n\nYour sister needs to understand the reality of the poor life decisions she's making. Her baby daddy does absolutely nothing to help with her current child, which she cannot afford, and she decided to get pregnant by him again knowing he's engaged. \n\nImo the fact that she doesn't have to take responsibility for her life because everyone is bailing her out is part of the problem. If your parents and other family members are so concerned, they should take her in or start paying her bills instead of shaming you for putting your needs first.\n\nYou deserve to prioritize your own needs and should definitely live on your own to protect your peace. Moving forward, help on your own terms, you're not obligated to take on your sister's problems just because she's family.", "NTA. The delivery needed a lot of work, but you were still spot on in terms of your observations. Let the family bitching at you take her if if they care so much!", "NTA.  Your sister cannot make decisions (like the one to make another baby) and then expect you to be responsible for supporting her, no matter what.  You have always paid your way, lease or no lease, so there is nothing she actually did for you.  She agreed to have you to move in to pay half the rent to serve herself, not you.  You are NOT indebted to her for anything there.  She needs to move in with one of your relatives who is criticizing you for not supporting her choices -- your dad or your aunt who are also apparently helping her along with you paying most of the rent.  \n\nAs for her choice to continue the pregnancy or not, that is her decision alone.  She just needs to be prepared, like an adult, to figure out how to support two babies soon.  Her decision is NOT your responsibility.  You should accept NO blame for her choices.  Let others criticize you.  They need to put their money where their mouths are, not try to guilt you into committing yours.", "NTA\nLet her move in with your family.", "NTA\n\nTell your family that your sister will surely appreciate them offering their support. Sounds like plenty of people are offering to co-sign and give money!\n\nWhat\u2019s that? They don\u2019t want to be responsible? Then tell them to shush it.", "NTA. I'm shocked at the response from your family. I'd move and block the lot of them. You are in no way responsible for your sister's horrible choices. For her to get pregnant a second time by the same man who is already a deadbeat ... I don't even have the words for how angry I'd be. I'm sorry, your family absolutely sucks.", "NTA - All those family members who can\u2019t believe how you are treating her are all lining up to pay her rent themselves, I presume?", "NTA MOve and find your own placed and start living your life.  She needs to deal with her own life.  You have done more than enough.", "NTA.\n\nYou had the right intentions, although you expressed them in a way that wasn't apt. I mean, you played the biggest card you were holding in your hand. When we do something for our loved ones, we shouldn't hold that as a way to control them or their decisions.\n\nI can understand where you are coming from - she definitely shouldn't have this baby, rationally speaking. But it's not for us, or for you to decide. I can understand that the responsibility will fall over you eventually. So you could have told her that she should reconsider, and that you wouldn't be able to support that second baby. But using the \"Lease\" card was like using a Bazooka for killing a spider. So you might have been wrong there.\n\nYou should play it positively going forward. Like encourage (and even somewhat push) your sister to get a job, make a life for herself. She can't be dependent on you and others for all her life. She needs to sort out her life by herself. You guys are there for her to count on and to support her, but she shouldn't take it granted.", "She had UNprotected sex to \u201cprove a point\u201d? Yikes", "NTA and your sister has serious issues if she willingly went along with this outlandish situation", "NTA. For not wanting to resign the lease but a bit an AH for telling her to get an abortion. I hope we all learned that this choice always lies with the person who is pregnant.\n\nHOWEVER, before everyone comes at me, what the actual fuck. Thats some childish shit. I feel so sad that a baby will come out of such a loveless and horrible act. Both parents are incredibly immature and they are not fit for having children. You are definitely not obligated to take care of her and her children. Just dont make it an ultimatum. If you dont want to resign, I would support that.", "NTA. - holy shit she's bad at decision making\n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep others warm", "NTA she needs to apply for welfare and go after her child's father for support. They have ways. \n\nYou are not her parent and she made her own stupid choices. You do not exist to clean up after her choices.", "NTA;  You mean well but this is a hard ultimatum on your part.  Your sister is a colossal moron for even going down this road at all;  Sleeping with a deadbeat to prove he will cheat and ruin his new relationship is absurd and insane.  Your ultimatum strikes me as cruel and heartless in forcing her choice but given the circumstances, absolutely needed given your sister's exceptional poor judgement.", "Nta", "Nta. It\u2019s good to know these people calling you heartless are volunteering to let them live with them or start over or paying for her things. She is being extremely unresponsible but it\u2019s her life. If she wants to have more kids she can\u2019t afford then she is allowed too just like your allowed to leave and spend your money on yourself", "NTA, even if she was to abort you should not renew your lease. The family who wants to enable her can pick up the financial burden instead. This is not your responsibility. You've been generously helping her and instead of trying to get on her feet she gets pregnant by the same deadbeat again and not for something else, but to spite his fianc\u00e9e and break them up. I'm sorry, but if you continue to finance her she will just keep on drowning and dragging you deeper. She needs a reality check like yesterday", "I'm pro choice. She chose to have a relationship with a deadbeat, she chose to have baby 1, she chose to get with deadbeat again, she chose to want to keep baby 2, and you choose to move on. What's the problem.", "*<She told our family and they\u2019re pissed saying Im being heartless>*\n\nWhich means THEY aren't heartless? \n\nSo THEY are going to take care of sis and her kids?\n\nExcellent solution for everybody.\n\nNTA", "Spoiler alert, she\u2019s probably been hooking up with the Deadbeat for awhile.", "NTA-You did the right thing. Any family who give you any shit need to take her in themselves. Your sister doesn\u2019t sound too smart and I say this with peace and love.", "NTA. Leave them to suffer the consequences of their actions. They sound like an awful person by ignorantly bringing yet another child into the messed up situation she's placed herself in.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure this is weighing heavily on your conscience but it does not need to. your sister is the one who made a crappy decision that is going to affect everyone\u2019s lives, including the life that is going to be brought into this world & didn\u2019t ask to be here. I wouldn\u2019t continue living with her even if she got an abortion at this point. She\u2019ll use you as her scapegoat & blame you. I hope your living niece is okay. how incredibly selfish of your sister", "NTA. She made her bed she can sleep in it. Like that's some childish and disgusting behavior. Idk how people think that someone else's burden is their responsibility. Like tf?", "NTA. Your sis getting her shit together after a story like that is hilarious. Run. Run like hell. She is the queen of manipulation.", "NTA. You are allowed to have your boundaries. You are not making her homeless, it is her decision. Anyone who is calling you unfair should offer their support instead.", "NTA - In 6 months, she'll be even more pregnant than she was before but yet she's going to be able to support herself in that time? Don't be ridiculous, if you sign for  another 6 months in 6 months they'll want you to resign for another 6 months to help your very pregnant sister because she can't do anything and after that, it'll be more guilt trips to help support your sister who has a newborn and a toddler. Get away while you can.", "NTA. You were a bit harsh with suggesting abortion and making that line, but it really is something that should get mentioned to her when she is already struggling with her 1 child and then went ahead to have unprotected sex again with a deadbeat to make a point. Sometimes we get blind in our emotions and someone needs to bring the facts to the table. *She cant afford the life she has now, she cant afford another child added to it. An abortion could stop it from getting worse for you all.* You put a boundary since ultimately, you will be the one who will have to take even *more* of the financial burden if she continues the pregnancy. \n\nShe is already living off you so you and you put a boundary. You could give her more time but let her know that she will be on her own after those 6 months your family mentioned. But as she had shown, she is a horrible decision-maker and might try and continue to live with you beyond the time set and guilt trip you about how she will be 6+ months along and need help. \n\nIf she really wants the baby she can live with the rest of your family right? The ones who are trying to lump all the responsibility on you? They can have her live with them until the baby is born and then after since they have such strong opinions about right and wrong in this situation.", "NTA and anyone saying you are can pay for her! Tell them you financially can't any more and the rest of the family needs to help out. Walk away, she'll never learn to take care of herself while you baby her.", "NTA. \n\nIn six months you\u2019ll be pressured to sign another lease \u201cbecause you wouldn\u2019t leave a heavily pregnant family member homeless\u201c  \nIn a year you\u2019ll be pressured to sign another lease \u201cbecause you wouldn\u2019t leave your sister with two babies homeless\u201d  \nand so on.   \n\n\nThank your family for their concern, and indicate that it\u2019s clear that your sister needs support whether she decides to abort or not\u2026 and that you feel unqualified to help. You are meant to be having a fun 20s, but you are parenting your sister and that\u2019s causing issues. Thank them for stepping up to help her, and then move out.

NTA - you are actually thinking about the child and her ability to afford another child when she clearly can\u2019t afford her own life & the father has proven to be nothing but a sperm donor. She needs to grow TF up & stop thinking that your purpose in life is to care for her and her kids. She probably should go to the same school you went to and get a career too. But no instead she decided let\u2019s troll my baby daddy and compete with his \u201cfinance\u201d over who can have him. Make sure once those two get married y\u2019all head right into child support court and use the wife\u2019s income to pay for child support ASAP - perfect wedding gift!

Perhaps she can broach the subject of moving home to your dad's in order to save money and sort out her living situation. Adoption is an option.

We\u2019ve been living together for two years. She is a single mom of a toddler. When we first moved in together the apartment was only in her name and she let me live with her. I was finishing dental assisting school and couldn\u2019t qualify for an apartment on my own. I still paid half the rent and utilities. After graduating and getting a job I became an official added roommate to the lease last year.  \nI make a lot of money for my age so when my sister was struggling to pay her half of the rent when her job cut her hours significantly it was a no brainer to start paying more. I could easily afford all the rent so covering another 25%. Plus I love her and my niece. My sister has no help whatsoever from the father so I help her as much as I can. He works under the table so he doesnt get his wages garnished for child support. I have watched her struggle to afford daycare and food for her baby so I also help her with that.  \nTwo days ago my sister sits me down and tells me she has news. She\u2019s pregnant. My jaw dropped. I ask who the dad is and she starts crying. I didn\u2019t expect her to say her deadbeat baby daddy\u2026  \nI was shocked and she continued on her \u201cexplanation\u201d: she saw a girl commenting under his posts and she went on her page and saw they had taken pictures at the same place at the same time. The girl also posted him for his birthday weeks later saying \u201chappy birthday to my fiance\u201d. She messaged her letting her know hes a deadbeat and got blocked. Then her baby daddy called her saying shes a crazy bitch and that led to them getting a hotel room and they slept with each other\u2026 all to prove some point to his fiance that hes not loyal and she can have him whenever she wants because she sent her proof after they slept together but the fiance stayed with him\u2026  \nAs she\u2019s telling me this story I just sit there upset. I started asking her if she went to the doctor and how far along is she. She said she did stop by PP and got a scan, shes nine weeks. We live in a blue state so abortion is legal here. I told my sister that I wasnt going to be resigning the lease unless she got an abortion. She looked at me with so much disgust and started crying harder. She called me an evil bitch and said Im a horrible person for making her choose between her baby or having housing. I told her with her hours now she cant afford even half the rent let alone the daycare she splits between me, our dad, and aunt so to understand the position she\u2019s putting me in since the responsibility is falling on me.   \nShe told our family and they\u2019re pissed saying Im being heartless to even ask her that and that I shouldn\u2019t punish her and if I should sign at least 6 months so she can get her shit together since 5 weeks isnt alot of time. I said no, she\u2019s ungrateful for all the help Ive done so Im out. They\u2019re saying Im an asshole since when I didn\u2019t qualify she let me live with her (even though I paid half).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was 28 when I met him, I was 17. I'm 39 now and am fairly sure he lives his life free from consequences like these.
