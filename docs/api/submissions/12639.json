He\u2019s literally sobbed in distress before when he had too much physical/verbal interaction. \n\nLuke got a male dominated job that involves a lot of manual labor and time at work. He works for 9 months and he gets 3 months off. He\u2019s sweet and even looks cherubic so he\u2019s the baby of his coworkers. They do baby him a lot and show him and each other a lot of affection. \n\nWhen he comes home, he\u2019s too tired and touched out to do anything. In the first few weeks, several times he cried and felt awful because I initiated physical touch and he was touched out. It was my fault. As the months went on, I made a life routine that didn\u2019t involve touching him or overwhelming him verbally so life would be easier for him. I have ADHD and strict external routines help me a lot.\n\nHe\u2019s now on his break. To celebrate he and a few coworkers threw a small celebration. It was fun meeting his coworkers\u2019 wives and hanging out with them. \n\nI noticed he was being more and more low energy through the day so I brought him snacks and asked him if he wanted to go home and he said no. \n\nLater, we were playing a game of Catan and I was paired up with another wife. Through a bit of luck, we managed to win after what felt like hours of play and in my excitement, I hugged her. \n\nThis set off my husband and he pulled me aside and started to cry. I tried to comfort him but he pouted and said I treated him like a disease the entire night when I was willing to hug someone I barely knew. We were in a corner of the house and whispering. I defended myself and said I just hadn\u2019t gotten used to interacting with him yet and it wasn\u2019t my fault. My husband got even more upset and then I got a message from his coworker that implied it was my fault. I feel bad that I caused them to be upset too.

They do baby him a lot and show him and each other a lot of affection.\n\n....interesting job.\n\nWhen I read this, it gave me the vibe of a child throwing a tantrum because they aren\u2019t getting attention. Your husband needs to seek a therpaist", "NTA\n\nHim being touched out and not wanting hugs... Ok. \n\nHim not wanting you to hug others (in a purely platonic way) is a completely different issue. \n\nYou respected his typical need for you to hold off on physical touch, and you checked in with him when you noticed he was down. It seems these things were done lovingly.\n\nRespectfully, has your husband been to therapy? It sounds like some assistance from a professional might not be a bad idea.", "NTA\n\nYour husband seriously needs to consider medication and/or therapy though because this is not sustainable.", "It's fine for him to not want to be touched, but you seem to be taking it as your responsibility to manage him and his emotions even during social events because he isn't doing it himself. The snacks, asking him if he needs to leave - you're putting yourself in charge of him.\n\nEdit: And I ask you, he takes his breakdowns out on you emotionally, doesn't he? Because you seem focused on *fault.* Whether or not it's justified for you to be blamed...And you'd have accepted blame if he needed a snack, but not for the hug. You list the things you did to avoid him assigning *fault.*\n\nCan you not see that, from the start, this is just a negotiation about what he can blame you for? You guessed some things, and he didn't clarify, then he took it out on you for guessing the wrong thing. He assigned *fault* and had his friend assign *fault.*\n\nThat's not reasonable - he needs to learn how to manage his need for affection through communication, which he didn't. It's also unacceptable for him to put this on you and try to control who you're allowed to platonically hug in a social situation where hugging is completely normal. This is not *fault* because nothing wrong was done. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA. You gave her a platonic hug, that is what friends (new and old) do. \n\nYour husband needs to seek some kind of treatment, you are not a mind reader.  You seem like you have to walk on eggshells when it comes to physical affection and that isn't healthy. \n\nAffection goes both ways. If he wanted a hug, he could have initiated it as well.

Treating him like he's their mascot, or whatever you want to call it (which most often not complimentary).\n\nWhatever is going on, you're NTA. Your husband needs help, or this is going to end in a train wreck. You cannot be expected to constantly modify your behaviors to suit his needs. What about your own?

Your husband needs to look into therapy. I understand you're trying your best here and I know this will get too much for you in the future. You'll burn out and start to resent him.

You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, don\u2019t guilt trip yourself. It seems more like your husband needs some help from an expert regarding the touching thing. I understand his feelings to an extent but I don\u2019t see why it would make him cry and melt down.

You to realize that you have value and are not responsible for you husband's emotional abuse.", "NTA. Married or not, you are an autonomous adult who can make decisions for herself and you do not belong to your husband. A hug, especially in the context you gave, is a completely innocent gesture. He does not get to determine who you interact with and how. He seems to be demanding of what he needs but completely disregards what you need.\n\nAlso, your husband seems to expect you to read his mind. It seems at some points he is demanding physical contact and at others he breaks down when you touch him. *He* needs to communicate his needs at a particular time to *you*, you shouldn't be guessing what he wants. He seems to be putting the entire burden of figuring out what is too much and what isn't on you, and that isn't fair to you.", "So he doesn't want you touching him but when you touch someone else, he is upset that you didn't touch him. Do you hear how ridiculous and unsustainable that sounds? You can touch whoever you like, always, as long as they are cool with that.  You bend over backwards to meet his demands, but it is unreasonable for him to try and extend his boundaries to everyone else you meet.", "I\u2019m not sure I even understand what is happening. He\u2019s touched out until you go to touch someone else and then he cries and his coworker emails you saying you were wrong? What?? None of it makes sense and none of it sounds healthy.

NTA..", "NTA. Um... what is going on here? I thought he was going to get jealous over you touching another man, but he's mad you hugged a woman? Something weird is going on here. It's one thing for him to have a touch limit, but for it always to be done by the time he's with you and for him to start crying over you hugging someone else is beyond okay. And this flying monkey bullshit with his coworkers has me thinking that he's telling them things about you that arent' true.\n\nBTW, it's not your fault that he's acting like this. It's his. Something is up with him either without his knowledge and mental health, or he's gaslighting you. You might want to look at taking a break from your marriage, because it doesn't sound like much of one.", "NTA. The heck did I just read. \n\nAlso, your husband needs to get some professional help. This isn\u2019t reasonable behaviour on his part and it definitely isn\u2019t portraying your relationship in a positive light. \n\nYTA to yourself. Just because you are like a weed and can grow anywhere, doesn\u2019t mean you should. You should be thriving in your relationship, not surviving. You\u2019re both the arseholes in your relationship, neither of you seem to want to find an effective system, you just pander to his issues and he lets it boil over and emotes. This ends with him crying, you feeling guilty and nothing moves forward.\n\nHe needs to take some responsibility for himself as a person and as your husband. You need to take responsibility for yourself as a person and his wife. His wife, not his mother. He\u2019s a grown ass man, childish behaviour isn\u2019t cute. \n\nIf you won\u2019t consider therapy, and he still doesn\u2019t want to open his mouth and say something, then go the basic route.

This requires therapy as soon as possible.  If he comes home and rejects you almost every day because it upsets him but you're also not even allowed a friendly hug with another human being without upsetting him, then whatever is going on with him is spiralling out of control and you're watching it happen because you think his behavior is \"cute\".\n\nHe -needs- to be able to function as a married adult human being, but instead he is further regressing into breakdowns and tantrums and thinking only of himself.  If you love him, then you need to start caring more about his mental health and less about not rocking the boat.  He needs a therapist to help him figure out what's going on and trying to find HEALTHY ways to cope with it.  What he's doing right now is not healthy for either of you.  He is in a marriage with a woman he refuses to touch and expects you to spend the rest of your life as, essentially, a platonic life partner without any discussion.  Every time you cater to these increasingly unfair demands because he refuses to treat his own issues, you are doing him a disservice and normalizing behavior in your relationship that isn't okay.\n\nAlso, his coworker needs to mind his own damn business.

Also using retreat as a way out, going and reading in my room, spending time alone. So I interact then take down time.  My husband likes to sit quietly and read so we often sit quietly together or go for walks while neither of us talk. He lost his hearing to covid, so even more now we spend time quietly together. We live by the sea and conversation is impossible when the tide roars and even that I can find the crashing waves just too much. I cannot bare the radio on in the car, I have never got used to that. The reason I am thinking so much about it is because my grandaughter spins and hums when my daughter vacuums and sings constantly and screams and covers her ears at the sound of hand dryers in public bathrooms. I thought SPD two years before she was officially diagnosed. She is such a mini me. She is obviously using her own sound to cover up outside stimulants and noise. She is also autistic and will not wear headphones etc as yet. She is for sure using the same copying mechanisms as I did. She has a light that makes rain noises, white noise etc and she uses that in her room. She retreats to her room a lot for down time and in noisy environments makes her own sound.", "Honey.

I'm not suggesting that he is a bad person, but rather a deeply troubled individual. Gay men do not find women to be suitable partners in an ongoing intimate relationship. So they will throw up barriers to that intimacy. A gay man in the closet can have sex with a woman. His physical body can actually function, particularly if he sees it as his duty as a husband. But that doesn't mean he wants an intimate relationship with his wife. It just means he is willing to fulfill a role. Nothing more. This is just a theory.

For example, my wife and I have fond memories of watching the movie Serenity and drinking Cherry Coke on our first date.  So if we were using this system, I\u2019d say \u201ccherry\u201d if I wanted more physical touch, or \u201cserenity\u201d if I needed less.\n\nNow I have a system to express myself clearly that feels less awkward *and* reinforces good memories.\n\nYou got this.

It sounds like he's got some kinda sensory processing thing or autism (or both!) and while I totally get why you've been avoiding touching him so you don't overwhelm him that's also neither sustainable nor fair to you and I'm not sure how you would know that hugging someone else would be triggering necessarily. It does sound like he's probably placed a lot of emotional significance to that and is struggling with the fact that you easily gave physical affection to someone you don't know but are currently avoiding touch with him because you don't want to trigger him. That's not your fault but you two need to work together on your needs and maybe trying to find a signal or something where he can indicate when he might be amenable to touch so you're not guessing  and just avoiding it entirely, which I totally get because triggering people is really upsetting and exhausting for you as well, especially if you also have ADHD, so it is definitely not down to you to take on the entire task of predicting and managing his emotions and reactions, and he needs to seriously work on communicating with you when he is happier to have touch and when he isn't. My partner also gets sensory overwhelm sometimes and she'll just say to me when I get in that she's over stimulated and needs quiet/space/no touching, but crucially, when she's ready for it again she comes and gives me cuddles so I know physical affection is back on the table rather than expecting me to psychically divine it. Sometimes she's fine initially and then hits that point midway through the evening and starts to withdraw a bit, so it might not always be possible for your husband to give you a heads up but like, he does need to take ownership of his feelings as well instead of leaving all the work of figuring it out to you. And in the meantime also needs to work on that emotional response to you hugging other people, it isn't fair to expect you not to hug other people platonically.

When he gets home he does his best to unmask but after a whole day of work, that sadly means he needs time to reduce his overstimulation.\n- Loss of energy at the event - Being in a social setting is extremely taxing and uses up one's battery very fast. Your description seems to cover this perfectly. Autistic persons want company but also can't handle socialising for too long before... \u2b07\ufe0f\n- Meltdowns - When reaching enough overstimulation an autistic person might break down. It has many forms that can look like temper tantrums, uncontrolled sobbing, going catatonic... This again seems to match your description.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that neurodivergent persons tend to group together. You having ADHD might increase the chances of my unhinged diagnosis being accurate.\n\nIf anything I said holds water then I also suspect he may not be aware of his neurodivergence. Might help to start looking into it.\nIf this triggers a 1-2 week hyperfixation for your ADHD, great. Please just remember he may need it breaking to him slowly and with his own involvement and exploration. It may badly backfire of you present him with a ready-to-go full explanation with references.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you might want to sit your husband down and explain to him that he needs therapy if he wants the relationship to last.

NTA op but you may wanna look into getting your husband evaluated.", "I think he's in the wrong but I wouldn't say toxic, this sounds like a major miscommunication to me.\n\nIn his mind, he was ready for touch and wanted it, and felt like she was ignoring him and got hurt. He didn't realize that she was trying to respect his needs by giving him space, so he took it personally.\n\nSometimes I think a common mistake we autistic people make is to assume other people can read our moods, because to us, the mood is so obvious, it *must* be clear to everyone. And we forget that other people especially NT people can't read us that way. So I might be triggered and hurt and on the verge of tears and my husband wants to know why I'm mad.\n\nI do think they need to have a talk about it, she needs to make it clear that he has to communicate his needs to her + receptivity to touch, and he needs to see a psychologist about an autism diagnosis if he doesn't have one.", "Yeah, autistic person here, seconding this. There's nothing wrong with him nor wanting touch at certain times, but it is toxic to control her platonic interactions with other people, and demand that she do all of the emotional regulation in the relationship.", "If you have autism then you should know that autism is a spectrum. Just because you don't have the problems he's having doesn't mean that nobody can have those problems.\n\nSure you might be right but you could also be wrong.", "I feel like he needs to communicate with his coworkers too so he can save up some physical connection with his wife.", "man I get stuck in this situation so often. thing is i love helping, giving, loving, etc, just in my nature im that kind of friend/gf/relative lmao but as soon as i express my needs and prioritise myself or refuse to (continue) be(ing) a doormat, they turn on me so fast. ive been called names and told awful things by people who were supposedly my friends. i feel OP so much. being a \"weed\" comment/joke is basically being resilient and im tired of it. weeds need care, too, but people are all too comfortable with dumping toxic waste on it and acting surprised when it mutates into a carnivorous plant. \n\nanyway, sorey rambling my audhd thoughts lol. i don't call it being \"selfish\" to recognise and communicate your own needs. you're simply asking for an equal, balanced relationship. i hope you find people who appreciate you and treat you how you treat them <3", "Is he a therapy dog in a children\u2019s hospital?", "https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Professional-Cuddler", "OP used the word \"affection\". That's not just simple close quarters", "I CAN'T KNOW HOW TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT TABLES", "I am lucky that everyone I talk to regularly understand and we have developed a code phrase for when words are pain. I also find I can listen to an audiobook, or something else where I am not needing to reply, it is usually just communication that needs me to think and repond that really hurts.", "Do you communicate over text much? I am much better able to communicate over text/chat than having out-loud conversations. It's easier to share personal thoughts & feelings, it's easier to phrase things carefully, and it's less stressful because it's silent and there's no eye contact.\n\nAnother option is maybe try to set some regular time aside to hang out together in a low-sensory environment and just have a conversation. Like take a walk in a quiet park together, or even just sit in the living room without any music/TV on and no other people around and have a conversation.\n\nAlso, I find the concept of Fork Theory super helpful in explaining how I feel: http://jenrose.com/fork-theory/"]}
