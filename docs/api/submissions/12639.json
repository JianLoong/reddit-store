He\u2019s literally sobbed in distress before when he had too much physical/verbal interaction. \n\nLuke got a male dominated job that involves a lot of manual labor and time at work. He works for 9 months and he gets 3 months off. He\u2019s sweet and even looks cherubic so he\u2019s the baby of his coworkers. They do baby him a lot and show him and each other a lot of affection. \n\nWhen he comes home, he\u2019s too tired and touched out to do anything. In the first few weeks, several times he cried and felt awful because I initiated physical touch and he was touched out. It was my fault. As the months went on, I made a life routine that didn\u2019t involve touching him or overwhelming him verbally so life would be easier for him. I have ADHD and strict external routines help me a lot.\n\nHe\u2019s now on his break. To celebrate he and a few coworkers threw a small celebration. It was fun meeting his coworkers\u2019 wives and hanging out with them. \n\nI noticed he was being more and more low energy through the day so I brought him snacks and asked him if he wanted to go home and he said no. \n\nLater, we were playing a game of Catan and I was paired up with another wife. Through a bit of luck, we managed to win after what felt like hours of play and in my excitement, I hugged her. \n\nThis set off my husband and he pulled me aside and started to cry. I tried to comfort him but he pouted and said I treated him like a disease the entire night when I was willing to hug someone I barely knew. We were in a corner of the house and whispering. I defended myself and said I just hadn\u2019t gotten used to interacting with him yet and it wasn\u2019t my fault. My husband got even more upset and then I got a message from his coworker that implied it was my fault. I feel bad that I caused them to be upset too.

Your husband needs to seek a therpaist", "NTA\n\nHim being touched out and not wanting hugs... Ok. \n\nHim not wanting you to hug others (in a purely platonic way) is a completely different issue. \n\nYou respected his typical need for you to hold off on physical touch, and you checked in with him when you noticed he was down. It seems these things were done lovingly.\n\nRespectfully, has your husband been to therapy? It sounds like some assistance from a professional might not be a bad idea.", "NTA\n\nYour husband seriously needs to consider medication and/or therapy though because this is not sustainable.", "It's fine for him to not want to be touched, but you seem to be taking it as your responsibility to manage him and his emotions even during social events because he isn't doing it himself. The snacks, asking him if he needs to leave - you're putting yourself in charge of him.\n\nEdit: And I ask you, he takes his breakdowns out on you emotionally, doesn't he? Because you seem focused on *fault.* Whether or not it's justified for you to be blamed...And you'd have accepted blame if he needed a snack, but not for the hug. You list the things you did to avoid him assigning *fault.*\n\nCan you not see that, from the start, this is just a negotiation about what he can blame you for? You guessed some things, and he didn't clarify, then he took it out on you for guessing the wrong thing. He assigned *fault* and had his friend assign *fault.*\n\nThat's not reasonable - he needs to learn how to manage his need for affection through communication, which he didn't. It's also unacceptable for him to put this on you and try to control who you're allowed to platonically hug in a social situation where hugging is completely normal. This is not *fault* because nothing wrong was done. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA. You gave her a platonic hug, that is what friends (new and old) do. \n\nYour husband needs to seek some kind of treatment, you are not a mind reader.  You seem like you have to walk on eggshells when it comes to physical affection and that isn't healthy. \n\nAffection goes both ways. If he wanted a hug, he could have initiated it as well.

Treating him like he's their mascot, or whatever you want to call it (which most often not complimentary).\n\nWhatever is going on, you're NTA. Your husband needs help, or this is going to end in a train wreck. You cannot be expected to constantly modify your behaviors to suit his needs. What about your own? They need taken care of as well, and you can't do that if you're constantly trying to be a mind reader and take care of his uncommunicated needs.", "NTA and your husband should consider therapy if he hasn\u2019t.

You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, don\u2019t guilt trip yourself. It seems more like your husband needs some help from an expert regarding the touching thing. I understand his feelings to an extent but I don\u2019t see why it would make him cry and melt down.

You to realize that you have value and are not responsible for you husband's emotional abuse.", "NTA. Married or not, you are an autonomous adult who can make decisions for herself and you do not belong to your husband. A hug, especially in the context you gave, is a completely innocent gesture. He does not get to determine who you interact with and how. He seems to be demanding of what he needs but completely disregards what you need.\n\nAlso, your husband seems to expect you to read his mind. It seems at some points he is demanding physical contact and at others he breaks down when you touch him. *He* needs to communicate his needs at a particular time to *you*, you shouldn't be guessing what he wants. He seems to be putting the entire burden of figuring out what is too much and what isn't on you, and that isn't fair to you.", "So he doesn't want you touching him but when you touch someone else, he is upset that you didn't touch him. Do you hear how ridiculous and unsustainable that sounds? You can touch whoever you like, always, as long as they are cool with that.  You bend over backwards to meet his demands, but it is unreasonable for him to try and extend his boundaries to everyone else you meet.", "I\u2019m not sure I even understand what is happening. He\u2019s touched out until you go to touch someone else and then he cries and his coworker emails you saying you were wrong? What?? None of it makes sense and none of it sounds healthy.

NTA..", "NTA. Um... what is going on here? I thought he was going to get jealous over you touching another man, but he's mad you hugged a woman? Something weird is going on here. It's one thing for him to have a touch limit, but for it always to be done by the time he's with you and for him to start crying over you hugging someone else is beyond okay. And this flying monkey bullshit with his coworkers has me thinking that he's telling them things about you that arent' true.\n\nBTW, it's not your fault that he's acting like this. It's his. Something is up with him either without his knowledge and mental health, or he's gaslighting you. You might want to look at taking a break from your marriage, because it doesn't sound like much of one.", "NTA. The heck did I just read. \n\nAlso, your husband needs to get some professional help. This isn\u2019t reasonable behaviour on his part and it definitely isn\u2019t portraying your relationship in a positive light. \n\nYTA to yourself. Just because you are like a weed and can grow anywhere, doesn\u2019t mean you should. You should be thriving in your relationship, not surviving. You\u2019re both the arseholes in your relationship, neither of you seem to want to find an effective system, you just pander to his issues and he lets it boil over and emotes. This ends with him crying, you feeling guilty and nothing moves forward.\n\nHe needs to take some responsibility for himself as a person and as your husband. You need to take responsibility for yourself as a person and his wife. His wife, not his mother. He\u2019s a grown ass man, childish behaviour isn\u2019t cute. \n\nIf you won\u2019t consider therapy, and he still doesn\u2019t want to open his mouth and say something, then go the basic route.

This requires therapy as soon as possible.  If he comes home and rejects you almost every day because it upsets him but you're also not even allowed a friendly hug with another human being without upsetting him, then whatever is going on with him is spiralling out of control and you're watching it happen because you think his behavior is \"cute\".\n\nHe -needs- to be able to function as a married adult human being, but instead he is further regressing into breakdowns and tantrums and thinking only of himself.  If you love him, then you need to start caring more about his mental health and less about not rocking the boat.  He needs a therapist to help him figure out what's going on and trying to find HEALTHY ways to cope with it.  What he's doing right now is not healthy for either of you.  He is in a marriage with a woman he refuses to touch and expects you to spend the rest of your life as, essentially, a platonic life partner without any discussion.  Every time you cater to these increasingly unfair demands because he refuses to treat his own issues, you are doing him a disservice and normalizing behavior in your relationship that isn't okay.\n\nAlso, his coworker needs to mind his own damn business.
