She sits right in front of me, so we interact daily. If exhaustion were a person, it would be her. Let me explain: throughout the year, I have always been very polite to May, as I am with everyone else. I like giving people positive affirmations and consider myself to be a high-energy person.\n\nBut then there\u2019s May. She just sucks the energy right out of me. She is difficult, to say the least, and seems to dislike me for whatever reason. We are often placed in the same small group to work on in-class assignments. In these conversations, she regularly disregards whatever I say or rolls her eyes whenever I make a point. The most irritating thing she does is interrupt me while looking me straight in the eye. I can confidently say I\u2019ve ignored all of this and have remained polite to May.\n\nActual things that I\u2019ve said to her include \u201cThat\u2019s a really smart idea, May,\u201d and then her literal response was \u201cIt\u2019s called being competent; do you know what that means?\u201d Another time, I said something like \u201cHi, May! You look really nice today,\u201d and she said, \u201cThanks, you almost look average today.\u201d On top of this, like 40% of the jokes she tells end with me being the butt of them. These instances are on a good day; on a bad day, she\u2019s snappy as hell, and I avoid conversation.\n\nSo yesterday, after biology, one of May\u2019s friends, Susan (F16), came up to me and asked if I wanted to go with her and May and chill at a nearby caf\u00e9. Despite Susan being good friends with May, I like Susan; she\u2019s cool. However, for obvious reasons, I declined. Susan accepted this, and I saw her walk up to May, but I didn\u2019t stick around since the bell rang.\n\nWhen I was at my locker, May and Susan walked up to me. May then told me that she wanted me to go with her and Susan to a caf\u00e9. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with her, so I kind of just laughed and said something along the lines of, \u201cLOL, why would I wanna do that?\u201d I\u2019m deadass not lying when I say this girl started pouting and almost begging me to come along. I then said something like \u201cI don\u2019t think being with you for longer than 80 min would be good for my health.\u201d I said it sarcastically, but it worked since she then stopped bugging me.\n\nThat evening, I was texting Susan, and she happened to mention that May was pretty upset that I didn\u2019t go with them. I just responded with the \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f emoji, and Susan then sent the \ud83d\ude2c one. She then suggested that I apologize to May since she was very disappointed. She even suggested that I make up some excuse for why I didn\u2019t come along, but I declined all this.\n\nLater, on my friend\u2019s group chat, one of them mentioned how word of May being upset about me not wanting to go had reached him. This one friend also said I should apologize since she was apparently really upset (according to his gf), but I refused and said that I\u2019d just act like nothing happened.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704404374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yoqte/aita_for_telling_my_classmate_hanging_out_with/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She treats you like shit and then doesn't understand why you don't want to hang out with her...  You owe her nothing imo and stick to your guns.  If she asks you should probably explain all this stuff you told us here though.", "Saying \"no\" isn't something you need to apologize for, especially to someone as self-obsessed as May. \n\nNTA", "NTA But she\u2019s so obviously a Helga Pataki.", "NTA. Someone wanting a friend does not overturn someone's health. Especially an insensible someone.", "NTA. If people press you, it\u2019s fair to say that May has repeatedly been rude and sarcastic to you and it was your impression she doesn\u2019t like you, so you prefer not to spend recreational time with her.\n\nIt\u2019s possible she has very poor social skills and thought she was being funny, but that seems unlikely. If she was genuinely disappointed that\u2019s too bad, but nothing about your interactions would suggest she wanted to be your friend.", "NTA. Point out to people saying you should apologize that she has been saying rude things to you and making jokes at your expense since you met her. She sounds like a bully. You tried to just say no thank you and she pressed you to come. If she didn't want the truth she shouldn't have pushed.", "NTA. I'd also be bring up real examples of things that she says to you to other people who ask, or even her if she asks. Exact quotes. Then express that it hurts your feelings and it's hard to remain positive/upbeat with the way she consistently treats you.", "NTA. She's bullying you and spreading rumors about you, you have no obligation to be polite to her. If you don\u2019t want to be next to her in class, you should tell your teacher about the situation and her comments towards you, and ask to switch seats.", "May sounds like a kid who has watched too many anime shows and is trying to copy a plot where the mean girl gets fallen in love with by a boy who tolerates her bullying and finally sees through it to her gentle inner self. Which would make her about the millionth teenager to make that mistake lol.", "NAH. May's into you bruh, she's not trying to be mean to you, she's pulling your pigtails on the playground \u2013\u00a0it clearly took her a long time to work up the courage to ask you out (albeit through an intermediary).\n\nBut you're not the AH because that's an easy thing to miss at 16. Apologize if you think she's cute \u2013 the teasing will calm down.", "NTA, but you weren't polite. I'm sure you needed to do it for mental health reasons.  It's okay to put your mental health first, rather than risk offending someone who really might need a reality check. I had to \"break up\" with a friend back in high school because being around them made me feel dark, uncomfortable, and they were never positive about anything. I still feel a bit of shame from the \"break up\" note (yes, 20 years later), but it ultimately was such a healthy decision for me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She may not ever figure it out if someone doesn't point it out.", "Check her closet for shrines.", ">but nothing about your interactions would suggest she wanted to be your friend\n\nI never got that feeling either. Also, its kinda a running joke that she hates \ud83d\ude42", "I'm tired. I don't normally pay to much attention to genders but I saw some people are saying maybe she's into you. I don't think it's cool when boys (or teen boys) bully girls because they like them and I don't think it excuses the behavior just because it's a girl. Maybe she'll learn you can't be TA to someone you want to like you back.", "A lot of people are familiar with how we interact, its low-key a running joke in our class now \ud83e\udd72", "Being mean to someone shouldn't be a sign someone likes you and you shouldn't be with someone's who's idea of flirting is to put you down. She can use his rejection to work on herself so she can express herself in an emotionally healthy way. Maybe with her next crush, she won't make them feel emotionally drained.", "I completely agree that she has a crush on him, but she\u2019s still an AH. She\u2019s old enough to realize that being nasty and rude is not a great flirting technique, and to then go gossip about him behind his back when he declined the invitation is deeply uncool", "Yup", "Idk, all my friends think she hates me as well for whatever reason. I've been very nice to her, so I honestly don't know what her problem is.\n\nThat being said, I do feel a little bad about it...", "Dude, I've been so nice to her all semester despite her rudeness. Idk what she wants \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I would stop being 'affirmative' with May in any way, shape or form.  Clearly, she's taking that and your 'acceptance' of her treatment of you as acceptable by you.  IT IS NOT.  And she should know that up front without any way to 'misunderstand' that.\n\nIf anyone else asks, clearly state what you have told us about her treatment of you and ask those same if they would even tolerate it the way you have.  Sometimes people need to be put in the place of the person they are criticizing to understand the situation in its entirety.", "Putting those things into words can really help frame it for other people, even your friends, who A, might not understand the extent of the things she says to you. or B, the level of wear and tear emotionally on you.   \n\n\nClear concise communication is a remarkable skill. Not just the happy or easy conversations, but the tough ugly or messy conversations.", "Pretty lofty expectations for teenagers, IMO.", "If everyone who's bad at flirting at 16 is an AH then \\[fill in the blank\\].", "I would have recommended instead of trying to make a joke like \"it's not good for my health\" say something like \"why do you want me to go? You pick on me constantly\". Or when Susan said she was really disappointed instead of an awkward emoji say, \"You know May is always rude to me. I try not to let it get to me in school, but I'd rather not get picked on outside of school too\" or something to that effect. May might be into you but either way I don't think they recognize consciously May is being mean. I wouldn't apologize but I also wouldn't hide why you're not hanging out with her.", "I stand by my assessment and my prescription. If she's cute, apologize. This would be a great meet cute.", "Sometimes rudeness is the only thing that gets through, as long as you know that things likely won't be friendly for awhile.", "It's one thing to say teenagers can be immature, it's another to say op should accept her terrible treatment and excuse her behavior.", "We SHOULD expect more from teenagers, not less.", "Ahaha, I would go so far as to say most 16 y/o are AHs at least a little bit! Certainly not the worst thing in this sub, and I\u2019m sure the kid didn\u2019t mean anything by it. But a bit of an AH anyway, imo :)", "I did mention to Susan that I was surprised May was so disappointed since I thought she hated me, Susan's exact text was: \"She definitely does **NOT** hate you\"", "Wow no it's not. Nothing is cute about feeling picked on.", "Wrong advice. May will learn that she can treat men like crap but they will still be with her because she is pretty. She needs to learn to treat people with respect if she wants a relationship with them.", "As if homie being her punching bag was a friendly relationship for him anyway.", "Seriously, teenagers aren't little babies. They're perfectly capable of understanding why you shouldn't be mean to people.", "Fair enough. I'm gonna cut her slack. Young love is hard.", "Ah, with that context and emphasis... May definitely likes you and if you ask Susan in person (when You're alone) she will probably admit to it and can pass along feedback of \"don't be so mean\" or something", "I can't help but think that the \"they're mean to you because they like you\" is in the same camp as \"boys will be boys\". Are you wrong? probably not. But do I personally like it or think it's acceptable? Nooooo wayyy.", "Welp, the many millions of happy couples throughout history who started this way probably think it's more nuanced than that.", "Damn and who am I to argue with millions of people at once aye? :p"]}
