Plus, if it were my kid who was that sick and having night terrors, I would want the child in my own room to monitor them. ~~NAH,~~ things didn't work out and communication isn't great, it seems, but if your stepsis needs that much assistance at night, she should be with her parent, not you. (Second edit-- okay, reading your attitude directed at other posters, OP, I've gotta go with YTA. I gave you more credit than I probably should have.

THEN, they decided to punt your stepsister over to your room after night 1, KNOWING that she has all of these issues.  \n\nAs you age, you will likely find more diplomatic ways to solve problems other than locking the door and removing luggage but since you're 15, I'm going to go with the assumption that you did one of the least confrontational, least dramatic ways you knew to resolve the situation.  \\[for instance, at 46, if I could not sleep with a roommate's \\*antics\\*, I would likely couch it in the living room with no one else around - stepsister may deserve a bed, true, but if she's interfering with your sleep, you sometimes do what you gotta do\\]", "YTA.

You weren't chipping in for the extra bedroom to rent. It was only a week, you could suck it up. You woke her up by being on FaceTime, then proceed to take her thing and shove her out of the room and lock the door. You couldn't take FaceTime to the living room or sleep in the living room?

Why couldn't you leave the room and facetime your friends. Why did you throw her and all of her things out of the room? How do you think that made her feel. It wouldn't hurt you to learn a little empathy you don't have to be cruel to a little girl with issues over not wanting to share a room with your step sister and realistically you are on a trip sharing a room you don't have to live with her and share a room always, maybe your parents couldn't afford another room.

Parents are Ahs for putting you in that situation", "NTA. This trip was for a competition, only made into a vacation because it was during spring break. Your dad and stepmom could have easily allowed you to stay with the rest of the team, but instead insisted in putting you in a situation they knew would not be unattainable, and then claimed that you could have sucked it up for a few days.\n\nIt's evident that you have issues with your stepsister and stepmother, and those need to be dealt with in a more professional setting, since you're unable to convey your feelings about the issues in a productive manner. Then again, considering how long your stepsister's behaviors and symptoms have been going on, your stepmother may not be willing to seek additional professional help (I'm making an assumption that the child (9) is already in therapy. If not, that's neglectful on the mother's part).", "you facetimed a friend. woke her up. threw her stuff out and have the audacity to act like a victim? you're 15. stop being a brat. YTA.", "YTA. I wish I had the unlimited funds that all of these commenters have for palatial vacation homes.", "NTA If it was a regular family vacation, it would have made a bit more sense for you to have to suck it up and share with your siblings. But the purpose of this travel was for you to participate in the game, so you clearly needed your sleep. If they could\u2019ve had the kid in your dad and stepmother\u2019s room the first day, they could\u2019ve done it the rest of the days. Other comments suggested other room arrangements that didn\u2019t require your sleep to be interrupted before your game or for you to essentially sleep at 7/8 PM. What gets me is that your stepmother ended up skipping your game anyway when that was the point of the trip. Why did they even decide to bring a sick child on a trip? I will say just remember to show a bit more compassion to your stepsister since this isn\u2019t her fault but your parents\u2019 poor planning.", "NTA - The whole trip is supposed to be about your capacity to play soccer. That requires that you get a decent nights sleep.   \n\n\nThere are three bedrooms. Dad and brother in one, mum and sick child with constant high needs and dependencies who wakes up regularly and screams in the middle of the night and who would undoubtedly prevent you from being able to sleep or perform your sport well in another and you in the third.  There  - problem solved!", "YTA. And a big one.  You can leave the room to FaceTime. And imagine how it must have felt for your stepsister to find all her stuff outside of the room?  You would have been livid. \n\nSleep on the couch, let your stepsister have the room if you can't be bothered", "NTA - They wanted to have their time and not having her around. And you\u2019ve been the one who NEEDED your sleep. They\u2019ve been there BECAUSE OF YOU. You had to perform the best you could, which is simply not possible when you have to deal with that. Plus it\u2019s not your business, she\u2019s not your child. Not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA\n\nAs a mother, if my child suffered from night terrors wetting the bed and waking up screaming i would not put them in a room with somebody else. It's my job to deal with that. Not everybody else's if anyone's getting disrupted sleep because of it. It will be me, the mother or my partner, the father.\n\nYour dad could have slept on the sofa and your step sister could have slept in the same bed as your stepmom. You make sacrifices for your children. Your children don't make sacrifices for you.", "So this is going to be hard but, I think YTA. Here is why: You did not pay for the rental. So you really don't have a say in how the room arrangements are. Since they rented a whole 3 bedroom house, I would have slept on the couch instead of bothering a sick 9 y/o. Which sucks because it makes you feel like you're less important. You're not. But as a kid, she can't help what's going on with herself and you have more control and should have more maturity.  Now, if you stepped out of the room and left her alone all night, and they STILL get mad at you - Then NTA. Unless they specifically asked you to babysit your sister all night.", "ESH", "NTA, you didn\u2019t give birth to her you are not responsible for her.

This is lazy parents at its best.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting with the sleep issues, the screaming, the backrubbing and lying down with a NINE YEAR OLD, that stepsis is either autistic, or some other disability that hasn't been diagnosed yet. \n\nOP is there for a SPORTING event, NOT a vacation. OP, next time go with just your dad and brother. Stepmom can have more one on one time with her daughter, and since she didn't go to the event, what was the point of her even being there? She skipped it to take her daughter shopping for shit that she should have gotten BEFORE the event, because she knows how her child is.\n\nYou dad and bro can share the room, since they are the same gender and behaves, and you can get your own room, stepsister can stay home and scream with her mom all night, everyone's happy.\n\nI do hope your sister is getting the therapy she needs, as a parent of 2 autistic children, this needs to be addressed, sleep schedules are one of the hardest issues for these children.", "NTA. But I'm worried about your sister. Nightmares that wake her up screaming and bedwetting at age nine? What the hell has happened to her?", "NTA  but is the child high maintenance or just spoiled?

I have five siblings and I basically played soccer my entire life. I\u2019m also the second oldest, but I\u2019ve always had to be the \u2018adult in the group\u2019 \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t always the best. \n\nSiblings can be annoying and always finding a way to push your buttons, even the ones you never knew you had \u2014 but you can\u2019t treat them poorly. I would be upset too if I had to share bed with a nine year old when I was fifteen, who wets the bed, has sleep terrors, and had to go to bed earlier than I should. \n\nFun story: I slept in a tent with my mom and one of my younger sisters. We were only allowed to sleep in tents (it was for Girl Scouts), and my sister wet the bed. It was disgusting, but I don\u2019t remember doing anything. It was more complaining to my mom when I woke up wet and warm. I may have teased her about it, but I think I was more focus not sleeping in a tent that was wet and smelled like pee.\n\nThe thing is, my sister didn\u2019t purposely pee the bed \u2014 but she did when she bit me when I let her share my seat before. Siblings are weird, and guess what, you\u2019re a sister (so you\u2019re weird too; remember that). She\u2019s doing the best she can in a situation she has no control over. \n\nWith her coughing and being sick, I can\u2019t help you there. Your family shouldn\u2019t have done a trip with her being sick; however, it\u2019s ok to do a family trip during a soccer tournament. My family did it all the time, and it is a way to save money since you already planned on going out there. One of my sisters and I, we both played soccer, so we usually had to go to the same tournaments. There have been times her team went further than mine, and I had to sleep in a chair or on the floor. It\u2019s not like I wanted to sleep on the floor, probably gave my parents a fight, but I did. You got to adjust, and I don\u2019t know why your family decided to do that, but maybe talk to your father about why that was happening, nicely \u2014 attitude will get you know where.\n\nJust find him when he\u2019s alone and not busy and go, \u201cHey dad, can we talk about the living space for my soccer tournament? I know I didn\u2019t exactly treat my step-sister as nicely as I could. I was upset about everything, and I know that\u2019s not an excuse, but I would like an explanation from you for the setup.\u201d\n\nThere were times when my sister actually surprised me when she made a choice \u2014 because she put me first. When I had to quit my club, another fun story which I won\u2019t tell, my sister quit her team too. She came up to my dad, and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I should be playing with this club if [I] wasn\u2019t there.\u201d I know that my relationship with my sister and you with your stepsister aren\u2019t going to identical. From my perspective, when you are young and you have siblings, you want nothing to do with them, but when you get older, you are so thankful for them. When your youngest sibling comes to pick you up at the airport with your parents, and she jumps at you when you see here. Your relationship grows when you grow, and I will never truly understand a family like yours; I never had one, but I think you should get to know your stepmom and sister (which is easier said than done). You don\u2019t have to, but it\u2019s a choice you have to make, and unfortunately, it\u2019s an adult choice, which means it has adult consequences. You sounded hurt when you stepmom skipped on your game. Your stepsister may have been hurt \u2014 you never know who is looking up to you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that your upset that they didn\u2019t come to your game when you didn\u2019t want them there in the first place. \n\nWith the early bed time, my parents have sent me to bed on these trips \u2014 much earlier than I usually would. You have multiple games per day for a couple of days; you might not realize how tired you actually are. That early bed time would only help your performance, and eating good food. \n\nLocking your step-sister out is a classic move. Anyone who has siblings has either been you or your step-sister. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but my sister and I have teased my youngest sister to the point where she was crying because she would constantly talk at night when we were trying to sleep and it was a school night. When we saw her crying, we felt really guilty because I goal was just to get her to stop talking, and we had to tell her we were sorry and that werewolves weren\u2019t going to come through the window and eat her if she keeps talking \u2014 and yet, she still is a chatterbox, and I hope that never changes. As you grow, you learn better ways to handle it, and sometimes you have to remove yourself from the problem. This is a learning lesson. You don\u2019t have to accept them in your family, but you do have to treat them correctly. \n\nINFO:\n- How did you tell your step-sister to go her mom?\n- How were you on FaceTime (because there have been times I made something seem like an accident but got the result I wanted)?\n- How did you and your stepmom communicate?\n- How did you talk to your dad with your concerns with sharing a room?", "NTA - you're 15.

You are just as obtuse as the parents", "Yea because a 15 yr old blessed enough to be invited for a tournament whose family turned it into a family trip has to abide by the needs of a 9 yr old.\n\nIt isnt about the 9 year old.

Most teams of high schoolers don't request your family to pay for an house, they rent hotel rooms for the whole team and go together in a bus or something.", "Actually no.

OP's parent decided to turn the game into the opportunity for a family vacation, forcing OP to stay with her family rather than her friends and teammates. \n\n>WOW I agree with your decision to not have children.\n\nHope you come to the same conclusion - you seem pretty closed minded. For the record, most people think I should have kids, because I am great with them and have an understanding that they are human and prone to making stupid mistakes. I came to the conclusion I shouldn't because my very white mother had no understanding of how to raise a multiracial child and left me super fucked up emotionally and mentally. It takes a lot of courage to admit you don't have what it takes to raise a well-adjusted child who won't hate you too much when they are an adult, and I wish more people thought having kids through before having them,  and even more people thought joining families together without proper counceling to make sure the family can peacefully coexist.\n\nWas OP wrong kicking her step-sister out, yeah. But she's still young and prone to doing stupid things, and it's not like she locked her stepsister outside in the cold with nowhere to go. Having suffered multiple lung ailments as a child, being forced to sleep with parents who are more equipped to deal with a sick child than a mildly self absorbed teenager is not the end of the world.

The tubes become.swollen and inflamed and then make breathing more difficult. \n\nIf it's acute (or sudden onset and likely temporary) then it may be viral and therefore probably contagious. If it's chronic (meaning consistently reoccurring) then it probably is a symptom of an allergy or other non-contagious ailment.  Tuberculosis is a contagious disease that can cause  chronic bronchitis, but I doubt that is the case here.  \n\nIn either case, technically bronchitis is the symptom of an illness not the illness itself.
