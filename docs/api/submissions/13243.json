Poor kid, getting dragged around while she feels like crap and needs to rest. It sounds like there are other issues that need to be addressed as well in regard to her health and behavior. I think you could have handled it better than just throwing your step-sister's (edit-- stepsister's belongings) out of your room and into the hall, however, you are there to play soccer and need your sleep to compete. Plus, if it were my kid who was that sick and having night terrors, I would want the child in my own room to monitor them. ~~NAH,~~ things didn't work out and communication isn't great, it seems, but if your stepsis needs that much assistance at night, she should be with her parent, not you. (Second edit-- okay, reading your attitude directed at other posters, OP, I've gotta go with YTA. I gave you more credit than I probably should have. I just know that when my kid had croup, I slept in his room to be there for him. But your attitude directed at your sister is terrible, and I didn't fully understand that you just hustled her out and locked her out. )", "YNTA. You should not have to sleep with any one who is sick, and anyone who has accidents at night if you don\u2019t want to. But you could\u2019ve been a bit nicer about getting her out of your room. I totally see your point, you should not have to deal with that.", "YTA for how you handled it but they are the AH for not taking your sleep seriously.\n\nTravel soccer is a big deal - you need rest. Sleeping in a room with someone having nightmares and coughing all night means you won't perform at your best.\n\nThat said, all of the travel teams I know of expect the team to bunk together. So, why aren't you rooming with a team mate?\n\nAfter your games are over, you should be bunking with your step sister. If you don't like the sleeping arrangements, go sleep on the couch in the living room.", "Obviously you are an asshole for how you behaved but your parents are assholes for setting the situation up.\n\nEsh.", "ESH, except the other kids.\n Your dad and step-mom shouldn't have put this task on you, as you're a kid yourself and your stepsister is not your kid.\nBut you punished your stepsister for being a kid. She already has a hard time with sleeping, she must feel terrible every night. And you lock her out of the room, making it worse?", "YTA - the kid sounds like she has issues. Why don\u2019t you make your face time calls in another room rather than waking her up.", "YTA and extremely immature. You woke up your sister, threw her out of the room, threw her stuff out, locked the door and you really don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong?\n\nYou\u2019re 15 acting like a five year old, you need to grow up, fast.", "YTA for facetiming and waking her up then kicking her out.", "YTA for being mad at your sister over things she can\u2019t control, and locking her out of her room was *way* over the line.", "Info:  Since this was a house, I assume it had a living room.  Why didn't you just go sleep on the couch?\n\nEdit to YTA based on the response.", "YTA.  You really think your 9 yo stepsister is having nightmares, waking up screaming and wetting the bed because she just feels like annoying you?  She very likely has special needs that you are not aware of or have chosen not to share here. \n\nI get that it is very disruptive to have a sibling with those kinds of needs, but you acted like a total brat.", "YTA.\n\nRather than locking her out of the room and throwing all of her stuff out into the hall, couldn't you have simply talked to your father and stepmother and explaining the situation to them? I understand why you would want to have a room to yourself, and if you just told them that, they might have agreed to it in the first place.", "YTA\n\n\nIt is not babysitting to share a hotel room. \n\n\nIt is not your room. You had no right to put her stuff outside.", "YTA kicking her out of the room with her stuff?? Obviously she has issues going on. Probably deeper rooted problems there. You're the one that acted like a little kid not her. Grown up You're a young adult not a kid.\n\nEdit: Teenager might be a better description than young adult.", "YTA not for not sharing the room but for locking your stepsister out in the middle of the night! She isn't doing all those things because she likes it. She is suffering too and while I understand that you don't want to be constantly on edge at night and want to rest before your game but all you needed to do was talk to your dad and stepmom regarding this. I am sure they would have understood this.", "YTA", "Wyd step sis", "NTA", "I brought up that it\u2019s not fair my brother gets his own room and I don\u2019t but they said it\u2019s because me and my stepsister are girls and that if one of us were a boy we would\u2019ve had to share with him", "They\u2019re saying she wouldn\u2019t have woken me up if she needed anything but I don\u2019t believe them", "I told my dad I didn\u2019t want to share with her. He said I can suck it up for a week and that she\u2019ll leave me alone", "Right?! She\u2019s a rotten and spoiled 15 yo.", "Usually I\u2019m with a teammate but since my family decided to turn this into a vacation I have to stay at the rental house with them.", "Wouldn't it make it ESH then?", "This! Everyone is missing the point. Stepsister didn't keep anyone awake, she was woken up and kicked out. OP IS TA HERE!!!", "OP needed to sleep well to play well. The sofa doesn't sound as comfortable, and I don't see why the stepsister couldn't have taken that.", "I\u2019m not gonna sleep on the couch just because my stepmom won\u2019t watch her kid at night", "Honestly it isn\u2019t the nightmares and stuff that would piss ne off, but the bronchitis, she should not have to sleep with a sick little kid who probably doesn\u2019t know how to cough into their sleeve.", "I told them I didn\u2019t want to share a room with her when we booked the house. They told me to suck it up.", "when did 15 years old became young adult", "I told them I don\u2019t want to share a room with her but they said I can suck it up for a week", "NTA. It's not fair that you don't get to sleep at night because of your stepsister's issues. The trip is for your soccer game so it makes sense that you would be need to be able to sleep at night. They should have got enough rooms for everyone to have their own space. Or since it is her daughter that has issues that cause her not to sleep than your stepmother and father should be the ones that have to deal with not getting any rest at night. It is unfair of them to try to put that responsibility on you.", "Of course, if you share a room and someone wakes up on that room, everyone wakes up.", "I don't think she's rotten and spoiled. Likely, she's just fifteen and wants to be with her friends, not taking care of a younger sib. This isn't outlier behavior here and I don't think we need to verbally abuse her for making a mistake. Teens are selfish by nature. I have one myself. They have less than stellar moments, but often it's something going on with them that we might not be clued in on, as they do have their own lives and brains. It sounds like everyone was just fed up. And when I was teen, I hated getting dragged on vacation when I was sick; I can only imagine how the nine year old feels too. Not really fun for anyone.", "She could have hung out and FaceTimed from the living room then quietly snuck in when it was time to go to sleep. There\u2019s still a chance the child would have had one of those screaming fits but at least OP wouldn\u2019t have woken her up and wouldn\u2019t have had to sit there in silence since 7:00. \n\nIt makes more sense for her to share with the brother. They\u2019re on more of the same schedule and neither is sick or has night terrors. I am two years older than my brother and we always shared a room in vacation just got changed in the bathroom.", "Stepsister was asleep and OP woke her up by using FaceTime, then kicked her out of the room. OP YTA!", "You\u2019re a spoiled brat.", "This is what being part of a family is, you don't always get your way and sometimes need to make compromises. Did you tell your father or did you ask your father? Right now you're coming across as very immature.\n\nYTA for throwing your sister stuff out and for locking the door, I don't blame your stepmother for taking her out shopping and skipping your game, you were really rude", "Would teenage be  better.", "Which you easily could have\u2026YTA", "You suck.", "i just think it\u2019s ridiculous to tell a 15 years old they\u2019re \u00ab\u00a0a young adult not a kid\u00a0\u00bb.", "Well she is not a kid. I had books in my head when I said she was a young adult. Maybe be a few years away from that. Still a teenager and not a kid. A teenager shouldn't act like that."]}
