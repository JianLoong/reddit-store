Plus, if it were my kid who was that sick and having night terrors, I would want the child in my own room to monitor them. ~~NAH,~~ things didn't work out and communication isn't great, it seems, but if your stepsis needs that much assistance at night, she should be with her parent, not you. (Second edit-- okay, reading your attitude directed at other posters, OP, I've gotta go with YTA. I gave you more credit than I probably should have.

Also putting all her stuff outside and locking the room is super rude. \n\nWhen your stepsister had trouble sleeping the night before her mom kept her in her bed so clearly no one, at any point, made you \"babysit the kid all night\".

THEN, they decided to punt your stepsister over to your room after night 1, KNOWING that she has all of these issues.  \n\nAs you age, you will likely find more diplomatic ways to solve problems other than locking the door and removing luggage but since you're 15, I'm going to go with the assumption that you did one of the least confrontational, least dramatic ways you knew to resolve the situation.  \\[for instance, at 46, if I could not sleep with a roommate's \\*antics\\*, I would likely couch it in the living room with no one else around - stepsister may deserve a bed, true, but if she's interfering with your sleep, you sometimes do what you gotta do\\]", "YTA.

You weren't chipping in for the extra bedroom to rent. It was only a week, you could suck it up. You woke her up by being on FaceTime, then proceed to take her thing and shove her out of the room and lock the door. You couldn't take FaceTime to the living room or sleep in the living room?

Why couldn't you leave the room and facetime your friends. Why did you throw her and all of her things out of the room? How do you think that made her feel. It wouldn't hurt you to learn a little empathy you don't have to be cruel to a little girl with issues over not wanting to share a room with your step sister and realistically you are on a trip sharing a room you don't have to live with her and share a room always, maybe your parents couldn't afford another room. It would be inappropriate to room a 9 year old girl and a 13 year old adolescent boy together. Yes your spoiled and entitled and YTA.

Parents are Ahs for putting you in that situation", "NTA. This trip was for a competition, only made into a vacation because it was during spring break. Your dad and stepmom could have easily allowed you to stay with the rest of the team, but instead insisted in putting you in a situation they knew would not be unattainable, and then claimed that you could have sucked it up for a few days.\n\nIt's evident that you have issues with your stepsister and stepmother, and those need to be dealt with in a more professional setting, since you're unable to convey your feelings about the issues in a productive manner. Then again, considering how long your stepsister's behaviors and symptoms have been going on, your stepmother may not be willing to seek additional professional help (I'm making an assumption that the child (9) is already in therapy. If not, that's neglectful on the mother's part).", "you facetimed a friend. woke her up. threw her stuff out and have the audacity to act like a victim? you're 15. stop being a brat. YTA.", "YTA. I wish I had the unlimited funds that all of these commenters have for palatial vacation homes.", "NTA If it was a regular family vacation, it would have made a bit more sense for you to have to suck it up and share with your siblings. But the purpose of this travel was for you to participate in the game, so you clearly needed your sleep. If they could\u2019ve had the kid in your dad and stepmother\u2019s room the first day, they could\u2019ve done it the rest of the days. Other comments suggested other room arrangements that didn\u2019t require your sleep to be interrupted before your game or for you to essentially sleep at 7/8 PM. What gets me is that your stepmother ended up skipping your game anyway when that was the point of the trip. Why did they even decide to bring a sick child on a trip? I will say just remember to show a bit more compassion to your stepsister since this isn\u2019t her fault but your parents\u2019 poor planning.", "NTA - The whole trip is supposed to be about your capacity to play soccer. That requires that you get a decent nights sleep.   \n\n\nThere are three bedrooms. Dad and brother in one, mum and sick child with constant high needs and dependencies who wakes up regularly and screams in the middle of the night and who would undoubtedly prevent you from being able to sleep or perform your sport well in another and you in the third.  There  - problem solved!", "YTA. And a big one.  You can leave the room to FaceTime. And imagine how it must have felt for your stepsister to find all her stuff outside of the room?  You would have been livid. \n\nSleep on the couch, let your stepsister have the room if you can't be bothered", "NTA - They wanted to have their time and not having her around. And you\u2019ve been the one who NEEDED your sleep. They\u2019ve been there BECAUSE OF YOU. You had to perform the best you could, which is simply not possible when you have to deal with that. Plus it\u2019s not your business, she\u2019s not your child. Not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA\n\nAs a mother, if my child suffered from night terrors wetting the bed and waking up screaming i would not put them in a room with somebody else. It's my job to deal with that. Not everybody else's if anyone's getting disrupted sleep because of it. It will be me, the mother or my partner, the father.\n\nYour dad could have slept on the sofa and your step sister could have slept in the same bed as your stepmom. You make sacrifices for your children. Your children don't make sacrifices for you.", "So this is going to be hard but, I think YTA. Here is why: You did not pay for the rental. So you really don't have a say in how the room arrangements are. Since they rented a whole 3 bedroom house, I would have slept on the couch instead of bothering a sick 9 y/o. Which sucks because it makes you feel like you're less important. You're not. But as a kid, she can't help what's going on with herself and you have more control and should have more maturity.  Now, if you stepped out of the room and left her alone all night, and they STILL get mad at you - Then NTA. Unless they specifically asked you to babysit your sister all night.", "ESH", "NTA, you didn\u2019t give birth to her you are not responsible for her.

This is lazy parents at its best.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting with the sleep issues, the screaming, the backrubbing and lying down with a NINE YEAR OLD, that stepsis is either autistic, or some other disability that hasn't been diagnosed yet. \n\nOP is there for a SPORTING event, NOT a vacation. OP, next time go with just your dad and brother. Stepmom can have more one on one time with her daughter, and since she didn't go to the event, what was the point of her even being there? She skipped it to take her daughter shopping for shit that she should have gotten BEFORE the event, because she knows how her child is.\n\nYou dad and bro can share the room, since they are the same gender and behaves, and you can get your own room, stepsister can stay home and scream with her mom all night, everyone's happy.\n\nI do hope your sister is getting the therapy she needs, as a parent of 2 autistic children, this needs to be addressed, sleep schedules are one of the hardest issues for these children.", "NTA. But I'm worried about your sister. Nightmares that wake her up screaming and bedwetting at age nine? What the hell has happened to her?", "NTA  but is the child high maintenance or just spoiled?
