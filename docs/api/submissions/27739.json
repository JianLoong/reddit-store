You are correct in believing that preparation for college begins now. Programs like engineering weed out those who would not succeed. If your daughter waits for college to take the hard classes then she's already behind and her dream dies anyway.", "Nta as someone who is an engineer you need to have a really solid math background. You can\u2019t go into that program with weak basics you will fail. The first circuits class is usually a weed out class also.\n\nIt\u2019s a ton of hard work, so yes taking all the easy classes in highschool is not the way to go. She should take some extra math or at least try workshops. \n\nShe is going to be so unprepared and that major doesn\u2019t let you fuck up. If you fail a class you are basically a year behind. Most program start you in calculus.\n\nIt\u2019s hard as fuck", "you aren\u2019t for being honest about it, engineering is a hard field so it\u2019s important you\u2019re doing courses that will help the ease into the actual career. as long as you didn\u2019t make it seem like it was possible for her to achieve there\u2019s nothing wrong with stating her need to step up in her subjects.", "NTA. She\u2019s not going to be able to complete this study if this is her approach to studying. It may have sounded a little harsh, but you\u2019re saving her from setting herself up for failure.", "I'd say NTA. I'm surprised that her HS guidance counselor didn't already have this discussion with her.", "Probably controversial, but NTA. I wish I had someone tell me to step up. I'd be a totally different career if I would've listened/had someone tell me to challenge myself. Nothing wrong with taking fun classes, but to prepare for college (if that is the route being taken) taking classes now would be ideal.", "NTA. She is not actually interested in being an engineer. She\u2019s feeling social pressure for either or both of: 1) school and community deeming your announced career choice \u201cworthy\u201d, or 2) honouring  and aligning with an admired aunt. \n\nTeens often announce *something* because they get blasted with the question everywhere they go during high school. Often, they have limited exposure to the variety of career options available to them. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s out-of-joint because she realized that her prior pronouncement might be sounding foolish to some, based on the mismatch to her current studies.", "Your wife is pissed at you for being realistic?\nNTA", "INFO - Doesn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s school have guidance counselors?  They should be meeting with her and telling her what classes she will need to get into an engineering program in college.", "NTA you're her father, you can't let her believe that she will have what she wants without working for it, it would be nice to her in the short run but a disaster in the long run. You explained it gently, it's understandable she's upset because she's a child, maybe talk to her about it again with more enthusiasm and promise you'll help ? Try and boost her confidence but you were right and your wife should back you...", "NTA - the idea of something is usually different than the reality of it. That\u2019s where I believe job shadowing and seeing what\u2019s actually involved, including schooling is important for kids, to figure out what they want to do with their life. You\u2019re actually helping her, she\u2019ll either refocus her energies on what she needs to do to prep for engineering or she\u2019ll find something that may be more suited to her, not a bad thing.", "NTA OP and you handled this REALLY well. You took the time to show her the realities and maybe try and instil a bit of work ethic into her. \n\nShe is going to struggle in real life which, as we all know, is NOT a cruise", "Nope, better to get a reality check now. My son  says he wants to be an engineer but hes not great at math and not real interested in it either. Why would I pump him up with bullshit? Knowing how much math is required, and how little he cares for it, thats pertinent info for him to have now while hes thinking about these choices that are still a couple years away that he csn plan for", "NTA. You gave her a reality check because if you're an engineer you need to know math, you need to know basic physics, etc. I'm a software engineer and I took TONS of math (linear algebra, calculus 1 & 2, etc). I'm in a great, lucrative career, but college definitely wasn't easy.\n\nShe could at least try though...I mean come on. Life isn't easy and you can't just float by.", "I'm gonna go with NTA because if just the idea of taking classes related to engineering made her not want to do it at all, I don't think she was all that passionate about the field itself.", "NTA - my son is at a STEM focused university in an engineering program. He and all his roommates were high achieving high school kids who came in with lots of credits, high test scores, etc. And they still say it is difficult, especially as they get into discipline specific physics, chem and other courses. They all have a good work ethic (and gpas) and it is still a challenge to keep up. If she's not willing to put in the effort in high school, the chances that she would learn to do so in college is quite low. If she shifts focus and attitude, she could do it, but it is better to be clear with her upfront about what an engineering degree looks like.", "NTA. I just graduated with an engineering degree a couple months ago. I\u2019m currently working as an engineer. I would not have survived college if I didn\u2019t want this with everything in me. Engineering classes are brutal. Especially as a woman because a lot of professors will still actively single out the women to try and wash them out. I was failed on projects and given to explanation beyond \u201cI just didn\u2019t like it.\u201d I was given lower grades than my male classmates on exams that I made fewer mistakes on. She was going to get a reality check either way. Better for it to come now so she has more time to figure out a plan b", "NTA. I needed this talk when I was a kid who wanted to be a physicist, but I never got it. Guess what happened when I went to college? Flunked out of Chem, scraped through Trig, couldn't pass the Calc entry exam. One of the main reasons kids need to take hard classes in high school is to learn how to study and get their brains used to grinding. No matter how hard you try, you can't learn that on the fly while you're in college. I fell behind my peers, got depressed, and switched majors. Hard lessons learned too late.\n\nYou might want to have a talk with your wife about getting on your side on this one. It'd be a good idea for your daughter to take at least one hard class in a subject she finds interesting. She'll need actual study skills if she eventually changes her mind, runs into a tough class, or heaven forbid runs afoul of legal bureaucracy in her later adult life. This is about more than just her chosen major.", "NTA. Im an engineer and id say over 60% of our freshman class either dropped out of college or switched majors.  \n\nThey thought it would be an easy ride to a high salary but the entry level math kicked their ass.\n\nNot even talking about the upper level STEM classes that thinned the ranks to an even higher degree once we got to junior/senior year", "NTA. If she isn't building study habits and challenging herself in high school, engineering will eat her alive.  My wife is absolutely brilliant, graduated top 5 in a class of 600 kids, took 18 credits of college math in high school, and she still got Cs in several engineering classes in college.  \n\nThe work load is crazy, even if you have the math and science foundation, engineering is a very demanding major that requires lots of discipline.  Someone skating through easy high school classes will be at serious risk for failing classes and risking scholarships if they major in engineering.  \n\nYou are 100% right to tell her that her academic priorities need to change if that's her career goal. \n\nThe only question is how gently or helpfully you did so.", "NTA!\n\nShe was not thinking, you simply told her the truth.  \n\nAlgebra as a Sophomore is way behind for engineering.  Even my non engineer children took Algebra in 8th grade.  There are lots of honorable careers out there, just maybe this was not the one for her.   If she does want to start focusing on this as her career, she will need to take extra math before she enters the coursework.", "NTA omg your actually awesome for being honest, I wish people would be more honest about careers and tell the harsh realities to teens. Its already hard cuz all the careers sugarcoat what they do and dont say how hard it was to get there or to be there. It will be easier for her to find a career she wants now that she has marked off one. Its not like you said she wasnt capable, you just said what she would have to do for it.\n    All that said, you still need to encourage her of course, like be honest with how hard it will be or how much goes into things but also tell her she is capable and would do well as long as she applies herself. Tell your wife she is growing up and while yall are still obviously going to be supportive to her, yall also need to help her realize reality so the rig isnt yanked from under her in the real world.", "NTA. If your kid doesn't like math and wants to be in a math focused career that's not going to work out well. Better that they learn it now than they learn it when they're paying college rates.\n\nIf she is good at math, likes math, and just wanted to enjoy the easy life before going to college though I'd say pushing her is unnecessary. But even then NTA. Nothing wrong with some coast classes before you hit the ground running if you're capable of doing it.\n\nShe might be mad now. But she'll get over it and she'll not be as poor later.", "Admission to good to solid engineering programs has become much more selective over the past 10-15 years. 85% of top 50 programs applicants took AP Calculus and AP Chemistry, to give one example. This is causing angst at top schools since less than half of HS students even have access to AP Calc meaning it is playing a gatekeeper role the schools did not plan for. Stanford recently removed the AP Calc requirement, for instance.\n\nThat said, you might have briefed the aunt first and let her give some advice first. Sometimes, the obvious comes better from a respected/admired non-parent. NTA", "What did she think an engineer was? In the world we live in, there are NO jobs that don't require some level of education or training. But your daughter needs more direction that just the dose of reality you gave her. She needs to get some aptitude questions, and needs to consider what really interests her and is also something she's willing to actually study for. I've noticed that whenever I admire an actor, they've always had formal training at performance colleges; even acting needs study. As does brick laying or farming.\nYou're NTA, but your daughter needs to think about her life.", "NTA. I don't know where all these other commenters live, saying \"high school classes don't matter\". I'm in Ontario, Canada, and every single accredited undergraduate engineering program lists senior Physics, Chemistry, English, and at least one (usually two) Grade 12 (senior) math credits as mandatory prerequisites for admission.\n\nFrom my own personal experience as an engineering grad, who had very very good marks in high school, I can tell you that even with all the high school STEM courses I did I still felt underprepared for parts of the first year curriculum, compared to some of my classmates who had graduated from private schools with better quality instruction. I cannot imagine starting an undergraduate engineering degree without as much high school math and physics background as I could possibly get.", "NTA - you're doing her a service by being honest with her and helping her prepare now. You also did it in the nicest, most effective way possible.", "NTA she was not being realistic about the career path she wanted to go into. You would have been a bigger asshole if you didn't let her know now, before she jumped into the deep end and was struggling.", "Info: How old is your daughter?", "My entire paternal side of my family are engineers. Dad and great grandpa chemical, uncle and grandpa civil, extended family were mechanical, electrical, aeronotical, It basically goes back 5 generations of engineers. \n\nI took high school chemistry in 5th grade and told my dad I wanted to be a chemical engineer too.  When I got to high school my dad told me I coldn't be an engineer. My brain just didn't work like that and I would be miserable.  He encouraged me to persue the sciences and become a labrat or something similar but he just saw in my I would not enjoy that course of action.\n\nI am so thankful he did that.  I would have been miserable but love science.", "Maybe she thought her aunt drove trains?    \nNTA", "If someone had told me that being a teacher was 90% Shitty administrative politics 5% abusive parents 3% abusive kids and only 2% actually helping kids learn and grow I never would have buried myself in debt for a degree half my former colleagues didnt have because they just needed bodies.", "NTA you were speaking truth.", "NTA.  I have a daughter who just started an Environmental Health degree.  She took all kinds of chemistry & biology classes in high school.  She knew that would be important for her to have a head start on college-level classes, but had no idea just how important.  She is breezing through her 1st year biology course.  You were just giving your daughter a reality check.", "The reality is that high school won't prepare her for it either way. She's better off solidifying her mathematics basics. NTA. Engineering is a lot of math and science. You'd think she would want to know that before choosing it. If she decides on architecture she's looking at a lot of late nights and a ton of work to only avoid some of it. Another thing to warn her about for engineering is how thick her skin will have to be and for her whole life. It is exhausting working in a culture that doesn't respect you. That's what is making it hardest for me when I consider I need to go back in the field. Always being treated like I'm stupid because I'm a woman. Always having clients double checking with my male coworkers about if what I said was what they need to do. Always having my boss make me be secretary and make it clear that the men on the team get the best projects.", "NTA. \nYou are right in pointing  out that maths is an integral part of any engineering stream, unless it's agriculture engineering. And you need your fundamentals clear for that. If she thinks , she can just learn it when the time comes, she's in for a hell of a ride.\n\nA lot of the foundational level math is covered from grade 5 until High School. She should definitely take some maths classes right now , it would help her in two ways 1. Figure out if really likes math and in turn would be up for an engineering degree 2. If she likes it and is up for an undergraduate in engineering, she would have her basics covered .\n\nYou should ask her to rethink her decision if she really wants to be an engineer or was she just fascinated by her aunt being an engineer and thought it would cool if i become one.", "You open3d her eyes.

Life isn't handed to you. Not a good life anyway.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m an engineer, I\u2019m also a woman. It is NOT easy, and I like it. School can be rough, your first year or two chew you up and spit you out.\n\nIn HS my boyfriend said he wanted to be an engineer. He was wonderfully gifted in mechanical understanding. He would do well as a mechanic or manufacturing. But, he hated math. I thought it was a bad idea because of that. I convinced him to take physics our senior year to prepare.\n\n2 weeks in he realized his mistake. He did in fact hate math, and physics. He did great on the application in our labs, but horrible on the \u201ctheoretical\u201d or \u201cacademic\u201d aspect.\n\nAnd thank goodness he realized before he spent thousands of dollars on it.\n\nYour daughter is realizing now that she needs to re-evaluate. That\u2019s a good thing!", "You must definitely take math classes getting up to a minimum of pre-Calc, but hopefully calculus and it also is good to take the three science biology, chemistry and physics and an AP version of one of those.  Also, computer science if available. Other than that she can choose easier courses", "NTA\n\nYou saved yourself thousands of dollars and possibly completely dropping out of college in frustration with one gentle nudge towards reality.  You didn\u2019t berate her, put her down or exaggerate.

He is not in those programs but his roommates are positively buried in coursework every single day.", "NTA. it was a conversation she needed to have and you where straight with her. I was an A student for Technical Drawing at school and a D- for Maths with aspirations to be an Architect till a good teacher gave me a reality check. Mr. Burt, I think of him often because he picked me up after he burst my bubble.", "NTA Part of your job is applying reality to children's fantasy. You did well.", "NTA. I did nothing in HS. Went to University late. Looked into Engineering. I would have had to take 3 semesters of math and basic science just to meet the prerequisite for the real classes. Maybe show her that.", "NTA.

She was going to waste a bunch of time and money going to school for engineering when she didn't want to do what it takes to be an engineer.", "I think the age of the kid is relevant here. If she's in 6th grade that was maybe a bit over the top. If she's in 11th, needed reality check.", "NTA. I had a scholarship for engineering and I failed extremely badly. It's a hard field, and even though I did calculus, physics, and chemistry in high school, I was still woefully unprepared.\n\nIf somebody like you had explained just what I was getting into, I wouldn't have lost several years to failing engineering and then rebuilding my grades (via community college) and finances to get into subjects that I was actually good at (biology and history).", "NTA. I maxed out the required math classes in my school my sophomore year. You had to take math ask through high school or get to a certain level. \n\nDidn't know what I wanted to do in college & took a while to figure it out. By the time I decided on a career path (which still seems like it would have been a great choice), I needed one math class as a prerequisite before starting. I failed spectacularly. It'd been too long. It would have taken a couple extra years before I could even start the program. \n\nReality isn't always kind. Did you support her dreams? YES! Dreams in this context are meant to translate to the real world. She wasn't interested in just dreaming and wanted to actually be an engineer. To do that, reality has to intrude and literally the sooner the easier. \n\nNTA NTA NTA", "NTA\n\nShe thought she would just blink her eyes and suddenly become an engineer.

A healthy dose of reality isn't a bad thing. I do think you should have a follow-up conversation with her, though, about what she does want to do. I saw you say she's in yearbook, if she really likes it, maybe something in communications or graphics?", "NTA we don't do you g girls any good by selling them this lie that they NEED to do a STEM subject.\n\n\nIf she doesn't enjoy STEM subjects and she doesn't have any talent in STEM subjects, then somebody needs to point out that she can do something else.", "She just doing a tantrum like a young child. IMHO you had played in her best interest NTA ;)", "INFO: Does she need to have these extra STEM classes *in high school* to even be admitted to these programs? Or does she just need to take them once she's *at* college? Because there's an argument for just getting the best grades possible to get admitted, then taking the math once she's there. It depends on what the programs are looking for, and I don't know.", "I had to take pre-calculus during the summer between my junior and senior years to get the calculus course I needed to even be accepted into any engineering program.  (It was so much harder as an accelerated course.) You are correct (and a good parent) to show your daughter the route needed to achieve her dreams.\n\n(The reason I needed to do summer school and take calculus at a different high school? Because the girls' school I went to back in the 1970's could not conceive of a girl wanting to take calculus.)\n\nHopefully you did not really kill your daughter's dream, but you may have done some damage by \"warning\" her rather than \"encouraging\" her.  Maybe tell her some stories about how girls were never encouraged to go into stem fields until just shortly before she was born.  Maybe it will make her want to try harder just to stick it to the patriarchy.", "INFO Do you know why she wanted to be an engineer? What type of engineering had her attention? Or was she just looking up to her aunt?", "Right now companies are all about diversity , she\u2019ll get the job no matter how shit she is as they need to \u201cdiversify\u201d the workforce", "YTA/NTA depends entirely on the tone of voice and amount of support during the discussion. Letting her know that she needs to take stem classes is fine. Try to think over the conversation to see if how you approached her was condescending or if it could be interpreted that you felt she was simply too lazy or too stupid to succeed in that field. I have seen some very smart kids that take the easy route until they see a goal they want, and they pass those courses with flying colours.", "YTA. Way to crush her enthusiasm without giving her room to grow or change her habits. Your method was more confrontational than supportive. People don't adjust their goals or work ethic overnight, especially not teenagers. Instead of offering to help her improve, you basically gave her an ultimatum: get serious or quit. Maybe you've discouraged her from STEM altogether now.", "YTA. It's high school. It literally does not matter at all. As long as she passes her classes and is able to get into college, she is perfectly fine. Burning herself out now by taking needlessly hard classes to prove herself is genuinely a waste of her time and effort.", "YTA I\u2019m an engineering major and in highschool I did fuck all and got by with the bare minimum. Let her have her fun easy classes while she can, especially if none of the harder ones are necessary to graduate, when she goes to college she can experience the stem classes and decide if she wants to switch majors herself without someone right now scaring the living daylights out of her telling her how hard it\u2019s going to be. Maybe she\u2019ll even excel at it while she\u2019s there. Only downside I see to this is maybe ap credits saving her some time and money in college.", "YTA.  She can major in whatever she wants in college, even if she needs remedial math.  Colleges these days don't accept you to majors, they accept you to the school and you determine your major during or after your first year.  And, and I say this with experience, you need to step back and let her succeed or fail on her own merits and efforts.  She's about to be completely out of your control, and you need to work on accepting that.", "YTA for apparently ignoring her schooling until you can dash her future hopes with \"tough love\" which is, as too often, more \"tough\" than \"love\". If she's interested in engineering, the time to talk about it with her is during source-selection for the upcoming year. Point out that if she wants to get into a competitive engineering program it would make sense to take more math and science classes.  \n\n\noverall, it's a good idea to take as challenging a course load in High School as you're comfortable handling if you have aspirations to a top-tier university program afterwards; that will not only help prepare you but also help you get in. Again, you and your wife have should been working with her on this throughout HS, rather than throw it at her like this.", "YTA - its highschool. Nothing you learn there is gping to be valuable as an engineer. If you want to point out she may want to focis on developing good study habits to succeed once she goes to college sure, and to be realistic to a degree that it can be a tough program but also reassure her your sure she can do it if she works hard.", "Hello, I\u2019m a mechanical engineering major, currently 3rd year. What is circuits? Do you mean electrical fundamentals? Genuine question", "I have mixed feelings here, because I know SO MANY engineers who skate by and do the minimum.  Sometimes that's why they are great engineers!\n\nI'm going to say YTA, not because you showed her the prerequisites to join the engineering programs at the university level, but because you are passing judgment on her and communicating this poorly.\n\nImagine your father or mother saying \"you'll never amount to anything unless you apply yourself!\" I know you're not trying to communicate that, but that is the message being received.\n\nYou could also have had her set up an appointment with a college counselor or advisor and let her come to this conclusion herself.", "You are n.t.a for pointing out the reality to her now, but I'm still going YTA overall for the following reasons:\n\n1. Catching up in math is horrifically difficult, even for a smart kid. If she's wanted to be an engineer for years, the time to point this out to her was back in 7-8th grade when she entered the HS grad track instead of the collegiate/AP track. Telling her now that she will need to take Algebra, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calc and potentially Calc in the next two years is understandably daunting and a bit of a slap in the face that no one told her before now. Either you as a parent, or the school really should have spoken to her about how the easy track didn't line up with her life goals. At this point she's not really *choosing* the easy class, so much as it's the next one in the series she's in. Whatever order her state/school does math classes in, they assume you have had the ones prior in the series or you'll be super lost.\n2. You seem to have approached this from the perspective of \"you've fucked up your chances to be an engineer\" instead of the perspective of asking what she actually enjoys and wants to do for a career. It's true if she doesn't enjoy math she won't enjoy engineering, but the next step in that discussion is to help her figure out what does suit her interest, not just crush her dream and move on.\n3. She can always take more math in college, but it will likely mean delays in her degree. If she still wants to be an engineer, she should finish the series in high school, and plan to go to community college for a year to get caught up to the collegiate/AP track. It sucks to pay for education she could've gotten for free, but again that's a choice that was made in 7-8th grade, and you probably should've counciled her better then. You seem to be saying that engineering is impossible now, which it very much isn't. I know people in my graduating class from the school of engineering who came into university with only the basic track classes in high school and they managed. It took them longer to get through, and they spent a lot more money, but it's not impossible.\n\nI'm glad you're giving her the dose of reality, but I really wish you had done so at a time where she had more control to make changes. Where were you every other time she picked \"easy\" math classes? Did you not know they build on each other?", "YTA don\u2019t kill her confidence before she\u2019s had the chance to even start . I am a woman in electrical engineering. I came in with zero knowledge and nothing fancy in high school and I\u2019m doing great. It was a learning curve for sure but its been so rewarding. At least encourage her to purchase electronic kits to play around with before deciding on a major, don\u2019t shut her down. Tell her it will be hard but that you are so proud of her for attempting this, not \u201cyou can\u2019t it\u2019s too much\u201d", "YTA. I had a great time in high school and got a smattering of A's, B's and C's.

If the aunt calls herself an engineer but it a software engineer, and not one who works with circuit design or complex mathematics - but instead writes apps for the phone or such - then that aunt most likely is _not_ using any of her math, and computer science classes in all but the most select schools require only the initial mathematics courses.

My mom just automatically assumed that because I'm smart I should go into STEM even though I had no interest. On a technical level I did well because I had the book smarts for all the classes, but I was miserable because I didn't enjoy it.

It's just a lot of work.  And some people start out uni without calc background.  It's just harder to get really good scores on ACT or SAT without that high school background.  If she's smart and determined, she can definitely be an engineer.  Talk to her again and be more encouraging that she's capable of doing this.  It's tough being a woman in math though.

I was probably like your daughter... 'gifted', but seemingly didn't apply myself at all. What wasn't understood (even by me at the time) was that I was actually just looking for ways to not fail completely while navigating around a lot of executive function difficulties. It makes weird stuff hard... literally just deciding to start your homework and sitting down and doing it is weirdly challenging. Meds helped me enormously, but there's a lot of other ways to get a leg up too (CBT, good sleep hygiene and so on).\n\nIf she's just not actually interested in the reality of studying STEM, that's fine and it's good for her to accept that instead of wasting a bunch of money for an unfinished degree. That can be catastrophic. But if she might actually enjoy it and literally can't because of personal struggles neither of you has even recognized, then that's a real shame. Why not get her tested? Might be that she's less 'lazy' than she looks from the outside.\n\nADHD and intelligence have very low correlation by the way. Your daughter can be more than 'smart enough' while still having bad executive function difficulties. In fact, it even makes it much more likely for it to go undiagnosed if you're 'smart', since you can use the intelligence to figure out how to survive even with the disability, since you might be able to get away with 20% of the effort where someone less 'smart' can't. I remember a math test I passed after not studying at all. I spent the first 30 minutes under a lot of stress trying to derive a way to solve problems with the Chinese remainder theorem without actually knowing anything about it beforehand, haha. Ended up pulling it off. Might be your daughter taking the 'easy' way is a functional coping strategy, not a cop-out.\n\nNTA, but get your daughter tested.

To be honest you pretty much can, and a lot of self taught people do ignore the math aspect, but the colleges *force* you to take higher level math. I think the only real world situations where I've used higher level math  for my job is where I write software for physics equations.\n\nThat being said, I truly believe that mathematics is SUPER important because it puts your brain into a different mindset than you're normally in, and this mindset seems to help me out with software engineering. \n\nMath is a very procedural, logical system of rules that allows you to solve an equation. That's literally what programming is. You have to think logically, and procedurally to solve a problem. So math really puts you into the same mindset, and I think this is why colleges force students to take math. This is also why I agree that all CS students should take higher level math.", "I haven\u2019t looked up the numbers but based on people I met in college I\u2019d bet money it\u2019s a similar story for pre-med and pre-law.

I guess my question is...does she really want to be an engineer? Engineering does require some creativity, but I wonder if there are other courses she'd get more out of.", "That's only three classes. Surely she's taking other things as well.\n\nI get the vibe she's very visually creative. Maybe something like graphic design would be more her style.", "Are you in the US? If not disregard this you would know your college process better than me.\n\nWhile I do highly recommend that she takes some courses related to engineering now while it's free to see if it really interests here, and I recommend taking calc in high school, so she has a good solid math base, she doesn't absolutely need those classes to major in engineering.  She will likely have to take Calc again in college regardless for her math perquisites. \n\nThe thing with math in high school is that the path you are in gets determined early on, so plenty of smart people end up not talking higher level math because they weren't high achievers in like 8th grade. They just end taking some extra prereq classes in college if they decide to do a program that requires higher level math. Like my college has an exam you take before your first semester that decides where you are math wise - if you are not ready for engineering calc you aren't kicked out of the program, you just have to take Algebra II, Trig, or whatever first. You can also prep before the exam by using something like Kahn Academy (used that myself when I returned to school after 10 years). I went to a well-respected state school that has great engineering programs - while the people applying directly to the engineering program likely would need the advanced classes, plenty of people apply as undecided, prove themselves in their prereq classes, and then become official engineering majors.\n\nThat being said, definitely NTA. I don't recommend that she overloads her schedule and burns herself out, but right now is the perfect time for her to test the waters to see not only if she actually likes engineering, but what type of engineering she wants to get in. Maybe it would help if you framed it that way - it's hard to succeed with just a general engineering job, she will need to have some sort of specialty, so the courses she takes now can help her explore that? I honestly don't think high school science classes really prepare someone for majoring in engineering, but they can help her decide if she wants to do computer engineering, data engineering, bio-engineering, etc.", "The classes you take in high school have no bearing on what degree path you can enter in college. Yes, it'd be smarter for her to take higher level math in high school to have a better foundation, but all math heavy degree programs offer all the math that you would need for those programs. Her decision to not take overly difficult classes in high school has no bearing on her ability to do well in an engineering program in higher education.", "It\u2019s different here.
