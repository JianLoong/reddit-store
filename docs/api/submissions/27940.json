I told my fiancee she could tell her mom that we will bring her over the weekends instead. While my fiancee agreed and told her mom that, her mom was insistent on following. My fiancee broke down and cried as she felt caught between the both of us. \n\nThe reason why I refused to allow her mother to come along was because she has a tendency of being controlling and overstepping our boundaries. For example, when I met with her to ask for her blessings to propose to my fiancee last year, she outright told me that she expects me to follow all her traditions and told me she hates my religion (I'm Christian) and I'm not allowed to have a church wedding. Even during the actual proposal last year, her mother actually ruined my proposal plan which I've shared with her. As my actual plan was ruined, I had to come up with an impromptu proposal at another location which her mother didn't follow. However, when my fiancee happily showed the ring to her mom, her mom got angry and said \"why didn't you do it in front of me\". That ended up ruining our happy mood and my fiancee became disappointed due to her mom's reaction. \n\nThese are just some examples of how her mother tends to overstep our boundaries and how she likes to make my fiancee and I significant events all about her. It felt this way when she forcefully tried to come along with us on our first day of seeing our house. However, I couldn't bear seeing my fiancee cry and I felt like the villain of the story for making things difficult for her. Therefore, I decided to compromise and allow her mother to follow. \n\nHowever, what I feared came true. At our new house, her mother started doing her traditions and rituals to bless the house without consulting me. (my fiancee doesn't exactly follow her mother's beliefs). And she even started commenting how we need to follow the fengshui layout and stuff. I respectfully told her that we won't be following it as we do not practice it. \n\nI regretted letting her mother come along but I didn't want my fiancee to be caught in between as well.

She has obviously grown up under this woman's thumb and doesn't realise how overbearing and unpleasant her mothers behaviour is. But that's not acceptable anymore.\n\nYour marriage and your home are yours and your fianc\u00e9es alone. Your MIL has no say about any of it. But until your fianc\u00e9e realises that, you are going to have a pretty horrible life where your MIL steamrolls over everything, and your fianc\u00e9e does nothing to stop her and becomes upset. That is going to become resentment, of you. Because why won't you just knuckle under and submit? And you will start to resent your fianc\u00e9e, for putting you in these awful situations.\n\nExcept, no. Your fianc\u00e9e needs to be on *your* side and shut her mother down. She is putting herself between you, when the truth is that she should be telling her mother no and thats that. Her silence encourages her mothers behaviour. When you say no, your mother paints you as the enemy, and has even more control over your relationship.\n\nDo NOT get married until this issue is sorted. I recommend therapy for your fianc\u00e9e to unpick some of the emotional damage of having a mother like this, and to teach her strategies to manage the changes that need to take place to stop her mothers terrible behaviour from destroying your relationship.\n\nFair warning, though. Most people with parents like this are never able to shut them down. Your MIL is going to continue to be insulting, demanding, controlling and nasty to you no matter what, and your fianc\u00e9e has already shown she's not going to protect you or your relationship from her.

Congrats on all your progress and overcoming the challenges you've faced. This random internet stranger is proud of you \ud83d\ude0a", "Like it or not, OP, you marry the family, not just the fiancee. So I would start setting boundaries now, working with your fiancee, of course, but she needs to be firmer with her mother. Perhaps you can do some counseling together to facilitate?  Otherwise, I'd rethink everything --your life with that MIL will always have strife.", "> How is this story different from all of those?\n\nthe genders, obviously", "I agree 100%. This one falls under \"Not my circus, not my monkeys.\" \ud83d\ude4a\n\nOP doesn't have a MIL problem as much as a SO problem; if they don't set and enforce boundaries, they'll continue to be stuck in r/JustNoMIL territory. u/ris3rr1 may find helpful resources in r/JustNoSO (which was made for this very scenario) and r/Relationship_Advice. \n\nThis MIL stomps boundaries, to be sure, but wouldn't have the opportunity to if given an information diet and the implementation of the [Grey Rock Method](https://outofthefog.website/what-to-do-2/grey-rock-safe-detachment). It's a mild ESH until further work is done and there's a safe therapeutic space to discuss these dynamics and set clear boundaries in place with consequences to match. \n\nI'd love to see a happy update from OP in the future, and I wish them all the best.", "This dude\u2019s going to be paying his MIL rent to live in his own house inside of 12 months.", "Yep. I am getting that she is of a culture that will expect to live with daughter and family", "OP is a therapist! And still enables his MIL. Yikes.", "Oh she probably already does. She'll be redecorating as soon as they leave for work on Monday.", "Time to change to locks to only allow fingerprints, and the type of magical lock that your fianc\u00e9 can't add without your super secret password.\n\nJoking aside, this is not a MIL problem, this is a your future wife is not taking responsibility and setting boundaries with her own mother problem. She may need therapy, and a lot of support from you on navigating this.\n\nWhat if she breaks down and cries about it all? What's next? MIL moving on, MIL taking away your child? Telling you and your fianc\u00e9 what to wear, eat, where to work? The list goes on.\n\nI hope you can resolve this now, and set a tone for a healthy relationship between all of you. Boundaries are part of any healthy relationship.\n\nSorry you're going through this, OP. NTA\n\nEdit: Typo and soften my take on fianc\u00e9. My knee jerk reaction was too strong!", "While she indoctrinates his future children as his wife just cries in the bedroom wondering why they\u2019re headed to divorce.", "OP is a therapist!! \ud83d\ude02, dear lord. If can\u2019t enforce boundaries nobody can in this family!"]}
