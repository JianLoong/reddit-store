I told my fiancee she could tell her mom that we will bring her over the weekends instead. While my fiancee agreed and told her mom that, her mom was insistent on following. My fiancee broke down and cried as she felt caught between the both of us. \n\nThe reason why I refused to allow her mother to come along was because she has a tendency of being controlling and overstepping our boundaries. For example, when I met with her to ask for her blessings to propose to my fiancee last year, she outright told me that she expects me to follow all her traditions and told me she hates my religion (I'm Christian) and I'm not allowed to have a church wedding. Even during the actual proposal last year, her mother actually ruined my proposal plan which I've shared with her. As my actual plan was ruined, I had to come up with an impromptu proposal at another location which her mother didn't follow. However, when my fiancee happily showed the ring to her mom, her mom got angry and said \"why didn't you do it in front of me\". That ended up ruining our happy mood and my fiancee became disappointed due to her mom's reaction. \n\nThese are just some examples of how her mother tends to overstep our boundaries and how she likes to make my fiancee and I significant events all about her. It felt this way when she forcefully tried to come along with us on our first day of seeing our house.

And she even started commenting how we need to follow the fengshui layout and stuff. I respectfully told her that we won't be following it as we do not practice it. \n\nI regretted letting her mother come along but I didn't want my fiancee to be caught in between as well.

It's her mother who's making her cry by not respecting your boundaries.  \n\nNext time, stay firm. Every time her mother invites herself, refuse to let her come.

She has obviously grown up under this woman's thumb and doesn't realise how overbearing and unpleasant her mothers behaviour is. But that's not acceptable anymore.\n\nYour marriage and your home are yours and your fianc\u00e9es alone. Your MIL has no say about any of it. But until your fianc\u00e9e realises that, you are going to have a pretty horrible life where your MIL steamrolls over everything, and your fianc\u00e9e does nothing to stop her and becomes upset. That is going to become resentment, of you. Because why won't you just knuckle under and submit? And you will start to resent your fianc\u00e9e, for putting you in these awful situations.\n\nExcept, no. Your fianc\u00e9e needs to be on *your* side and shut her mother down. She is putting herself between you, when the truth is that she should be telling her mother no and thats that. Her silence encourages her mothers behaviour. When you say no, your mother paints you as the enemy, and has even more control over your relationship.\n\nDo NOT get married until this issue is sorted. I recommend therapy for your fianc\u00e9e to unpick some of the emotional damage of having a mother like this, and to teach her strategies to manage the changes that need to take place to stop her mothers terrible behaviour from destroying your relationship.\n\nFair warning, though. Most people with parents like this are never able to shut them down. Your MIL is going to continue to be insulting, demanding, controlling and nasty to you no matter what, and your fianc\u00e9e has already shown she's not going to protect you or your relationship from her. You may need to just accept that this is how your relationship will always be ... or that this isn't the relationship you want.", "Good luck OP. You gonna need it. \n\nYour MIL will be raising your kids, choosing schools, teaching them aaaaallll about her beliefs, poisoning the kids and your future wife against everything and anything YOU want. \nWhere do your new family traditions start?

It won\u2019t get better without some heavy intervention.\n\nTry to find some way to help your fianc\u00e9e find her backbone. Set clear, firm boundaries for Mil, you can do that kind,y, and show fianc\u00e9e how they are being trampled on because Mil has no chill but needs to control everything, at the cost of ruining your special memories ( What will you look back on fondly in future years? ) \n\nIt sounds like she sucks the joy out of every5hing, maybe tell her \u201c your actions are pushing us away. We don\u2019t want to spend time with you when it leaves us feeling sad and disrespected. Keep it up and we\u2019ll see less of you until we see nothing if you if you can\u2019t behave better\u201d.

To the point where, after 15 years of being together, we have never been formally married\n\nMIL was mad at us for getting engaged at night, and not being able to tell her until the next morning. We were nowhere near her when my husband proposed, and he did it spur-of-the-moment during an intimate conversation.  But, y'know, we still should have involved *her.*\n\nMIL desperately wanted to plan our wedding. My husband had a location in mind that he'd thought about for years. Since it would be my second wedding (don't worry, I'd been divorced for several years before we met), I was thrilled that he even wanted to have input! But MIL immediately tried to shut that down by bringing up costs, lodging, and alcohol. Mind you, we weren't planning a destination wedding, but she worked very hard to plant the seeds of \"we can't afford that,\" in his head.  Even though she wasn't going to be paying for it.  Husband finally got so stressed out and anxious about the wedding that we just dropped the whole thing. We never even settled on a date because of her meddling.\n\nMIL firmly believed that my husband (her own son) was the man of her house.  Despite having a husband (who sadly passed away about 10 years ago), and a fiance of her own several years later, Husband was at her house working on her projects or property several nights a week, every week. We were expected to spend most of our weekends there doing stuff for her. When he finally started saying no and drawing boundaries, which happened over a birthday party I threw with our adult friends, and was graciously hosted by one of them in their own home, she had a two-day meltdown about how much she's sacrificed and given up for him. She then decided to give him the silent treatment, which actually ended up being a relief, albeit temporary.\n\nMIL decided she wanted to move to a different U.S. State, and begged us for *years* to go with her. We finally let her talk us into going on a road trip to the state she was currently obsessed with (it changed every few months). So we spent 40 of 72 hours in the car with her one weekend.  It was exactly as hellish as it sounds.  She brought a real estate agent into the madness, and dragged us around the northern half of this state looking at different houses. None of which she ended up liking. But, at every one, she'd tell us how we could buy a mobile home to live on the property with her, and wouldn't that be great? Neither of us were having it.  But we ended up really liking that State.\n\nWe found a house we loved and moved to the different U.S. State. Before and without MIL.  We set up our house exactly how we wanted it, which didn't include a guest room.  MIL complained bitterly about how her son abandoned her and left her all alone, and didn't even consider her in our new home.\n\nAt this point, 12 years since we'd been together, he was finally able to draw boundaries.  He ended up getting into a fight with her over the phone, and she hung up on him.  He knew he was in trouble, and that she was giving him the silent treatment, but he let her. He never called back, he didn't apologize, and finally drew that hard boundary by going full no-contact.  There has been one call to her since, to inform her that my son passed away. But she literally didn't care, and immediately wanted to \"solve whatever this is between us.\" He ended the call.\n\nOP, this is what you're signing up for.

My husband and I kept choosing each other, despite his mother's utter dismay and attempts to disrupt that. And we have had a number of fights that we may not have had if she wasn't like this.  Her being out of our lives for the past three years has been a massive relief, and we've been able to grow together in ways that just weren't possible before. But it was a very long time coming, and it's not at all guaranteed.  My husband has also been left with severe anxiety, very low self-esteem, and anger issues.

It's part of his culture, and he believes strongly that his actions are protecting his child. That's precious. Learn some cultural tolerance on your end as well because from your MIL's POV, you brought an outside religion and practice into her household, and brainwashed her daughter with it. From her actions it sounds like you've been denying your fiancee her cultural practices ingrained in her family since young, thus the MIL demanding to follow you guys everywhere.\n\nDo your thing, and let your MIL do her thing. Everyone's happy. If she suggests some way of fengshui-ing the house, just nod in agreement, or say \"we will consider\", and then not do it later. The way you responded by telling her that you don't believe in it and will therefore not do it, is viewed as extremely arrogant from her POV, and is some low tier EQ by any standard. Wait till you find out about the tea ceremony where you have to kneel before your MIL. You said your fiancee doesn't really believe in Fengshui? Haha, you are so naive. Yes, most younger generations don't believe in it, but there's still a tinge of trust in the system. You can easily test this by asking your partner if she's okay with sleeping with her feet facing the bedroom door (like a dead person ready to be carried out to be buried).\n\nPeople in this thread labelling your fiancee as \"groomed\" and brainwashed by her mum are living in a bubble. This is clearly a classic case of mismatch of cultures, and a lack of cultural acceptance from both sides. From a totally objective POV as a counterpoint, it is super weird to be hanging a figure of a tortured, shrivelled man pinned to a cross. It means the holy sacrifice and God's love to you, but it's super violent without context. To your MIL, you're the one grooming her baby daughter with a barbaric (based on the decor of a tortured man bleeding from his abdomen) belief system that actively denies her own beliefs (something something false god) while cutting her off from her daughter.\n\nPut yourself in your MIL's shoes, and imagine your future daughter marrying a Muslim/Hindu/Taoist/Buddhist, and her partner denouncing Christianity while not allowing you to visit your daughter as and when you like. Then telling you you can't have a church wedding if he/she ever proposed to your daughter, while still asking you for your blessing to do so. When you try give thanks to your God during family meals, they stop you and tell you \"we don't do that in this household because we don't believe in your god.\" Doesn't feel too good does it? You're not just marrying the girl, you're marrying her family. My advice is to let both sides do their thing. I had 2 weddings to appease both families.   \nBecause at the end of the day none of it matters.

Blaming everything you don\u2019t like on \u201cincels\u201d is just as harmful as sexism.\n\nIt is not an incel narrative when it has a factual history of happening. This sub is very well documented to give different judgements based on gender.\n\nThere are posts with the same situations as this with the genders reversed and the people on here are MUCH more rude about it and call the offending men \u201cmummas boys\u201d, \u201cmumma\u2019s puppets\u201d, \u201cmummy\u2019s boy\u201d and much more. I\u2019m not seeing any rudeness of the kind here towards the fianc\u00e9e.\n\nYou\u2019re as bad as the incels you speak of if you acknowledge sexist responses in only one way. Feminism was founded on equality and equity.", "It\u2019s actually common for therapists to need therapy themselves. Many therapists have a lot of personal experience with mental illness, grief, complicated and toxic relationships, etc and that perspective makes them have genuine empathy for their patients/clients. Versus just sympathy."]}
