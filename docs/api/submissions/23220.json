Your house. You get to set the boundaries of who is there and when. My in-laws are awesome but they don't get to just drop by whenever.

Even if you give someone a key they should still ask before letting themselves in otherwise it is creepy. In the mean time I suggest changing the locks (it's very simple you and do it yourself) and not giving your father in law a key.

It's normal enough to give a spare key to parents who live nearby in case of emergencies, but in most families, it is not normal for a parent or other relative just to go round and make themselves at home.\n\nBut you say your FIL doesn't have boundaries, and thinks it's normal for him to just come round when you're out and get on with some tasks around the house, or borrow your husband's tools or something.  And some people do live like that, and it's not wrong to choose to live that way, but everyone has to agree.\n\nAnd for him to keep a key without telling you is completely unreasonable. How sure are you that he didn't tell your husband?", "Nta if you don't get the key back change the locks.  It's not expensive and easy to install. Dad will never respect your boundaries. He proved that by making a key for himself without getting permission.", "NTA This is your house. No one else has any rights to it. There reaction is proof that you were right.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting the key back will not cut it ... you need to change the locks.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your house, you pay the bills and the mortgage. He has no right to have a spare key, even if he is doing some work on the house. Would you give a key to a random construction company that comes to work on your roof? No, you would not. \n\nCall a locksmith and have every single lock changed. Make sure you are at home when this happens. Most good locksmiths will not give a key to anyone else besides the person who pays them.", "There be more than one key in FIL\u2019s possession. \n\nTo make bold: two * at the start of bold, right against the first letter.

You don't want a bully in your life.\n\nHowever, know that bullies never give up in the end. He'll be back.", "NTA. He had no right to have a key and less right to enter your home without permission.
