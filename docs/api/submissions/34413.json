My SIL and her boyfriend have never contributed financially to this vacation however my husband and I do. \n\nSIL and boyfriend missed this past year because they welcomed a new baby to their family and they have 2 very untrained bully breed dogs. The dogs have yet to be allowed to come on vacation so prior to this past year, they have sot out someone to watch the dogs. \n\nI want to mention, these dogs are very untrained. They have bit me, tried to attack my son which led to him being terrified of them (thankfully they were in crates at the time so it was just loud barking) and they uncontrollably jump at you when excited if not in the cages. SIL has made it clear they are her first babies and since their actual baby was born, she says the dogs have calmed down\u2026 we won\u2019t risk going over there after previous encounters.\n\nWe are currently planning our next annual trip, I am due with our next child so we will be expanding our trip two additional children.\n\nMy MIL suggested that we rent a bigger house with 3 bedrooms and a walk out basement so my SIL and BF could come with the dogs and their child. The problem being is that MIL and FIL always get the biggest room and ensuit which for them has been a non negotiable, SIL with her dogs, bf and baby will get the entire downstairs, so my husband and I with 2 kids under 2YO will get whatever room is left for the 4 of us to cram in to.\n\nWhen this was brought up, I was shocked at the suggestion especially considering my husband and I have been the ones to contribute in the past financially.\n\nI made the suggestion that our portion of the family (hubs and kids) will find our own place to stay because we don\u2019t want to vacation with the dogs or be crammed in a small room. Well\u2026 MIL was not happy about that and said SIL has had to compromise and miss out before and the dogs shouldn\u2019t be a problem or reason for us not to stay together. That what\u2019s the point of even planning it if we won\u2019t stay with them? She is pissed at me and thinks I\u2019m being a judgemental jerk to my SIL.\n\nMy husband supports my reasons thank goodness but I know he is concerned the vacation won\u2019t happen unless I cave.\n\nAITA for suggesting we stay in separate accommodations?", "created_utc": 1704485137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zg4e2/aita_for_suggesting_alternative_housing/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the dogs have bitten you and attacked your kid in the past, do not go near them again.  Make it clear that you and your family will not go if the dogs will be there.  Your SIL can love her dogs all she wants.  She doesn't get to force you into being around them.  And your husband should be on board with the possible conclusion that you just don't go on these vacations anymore.  He should also realize that this isn't your fault.", "Hey, *you* are paying for this upcoming vacation. And since you are autonomous adults with very small children, you want to *see to it* that you are not stuck in the least desirable room of the rental, and have to face untrained and possibly aggressive dogs as soon as you leave your room. Oh, hell no, why would you sign up for that little slice of hell?\n\nYou need a separate rental.\n\nAnd if your in-laws can\u2019t afford a rental without your contribution, then they can downsize - or not go. \n\nAnd if the vacation just \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen\u201d because somebody pitches a little hissy fit-well! So be it! I am sure your nuclear family can manage a few days to get away without all the extra baggage and drama the extended family brings. NTA", "NTA. Hold firm. Fuck taking a vacation with those dogs. Your suggested compromise is more than reasonable.", "NTA. Why do some people insist on sharing living accommodations on vacation? I would want to relax, not have an extra 5 people to constantly be around.", "NTA at all. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to give the dogs a second chance, one fuck up with them was enough. \n\nDon\u2019t be guilted by your MIL or SIL. Maybe last year was the last time you vacation with them, and it\u2019s time to start vacationing with your household family only.", ">SIL has made it clear they are her first babies and since their actual baby was born, she says the dogs have calmed down\n\nNope, I don't believe that. Having adopted several dogs with aggression issues, introducing a newborn into the equation does NOT improve things. You've been bitten by them in the past and are pregnant - what could possibly go wrong? /s\n\nNTA. Your families are growing and you require more comfortable accomodations.", "NTA. Take that money and go on vacation with your children. It's just downright dumb to put your children in danger unnecessarily. I think this might be the proverbial hill.", "NTA\n\nstick to your guns. The safety of your kids come first, and also why should you pay and get the worst part of the deal.\n\nJust cancel and take a holiday with just you, your husband and your children, it will be much less stress.", "NTA\n\nAnd don\u2019t do this. Those dogs will probably cause damage and you\u2019ll end up having to pay a damage waiver.\n\nIf MIL wants her child to come then she can pay for that family. \n\nTBH it sounds like it\u2019s time for this tradition  to end and your nuclear family can create your own vacation plans moving forward.", "Given you're paying for the additional rental, NTA at all. Totally reasonable not to want stay with them under those circumstances.", "Nta. \n\nTo MIL. \n\nThe fact you somehow think it's ok to subject myself who was bitten and my child almost bitten to dogs he is now terrified of is insane. That is not accommodation. That is outright showing you care nothing for either of us or our safety.\n\nThe fact you find it ok to make my family stay in one room while sil get an entire downstairs and we are putting money into this when she is not is insane.\n\nYou have shown your true colors. You have shown who the golden child is. You have shown that the safety of my family means nothing to what she wants. You have shown that unless we bow down to your rules, we are in the wrong for protecting our child and not forcing him to be around the dogs he fears. Unless we stay with you, what's the point, right?\n\nAs such, my family will no longer be doing vacations with you. We will now be planning a vacation with just us. I refuse to allow you to think you can manipulate me into placing my children in danger. Into paying for a vacation that we will hate and stress us to no end. So because it won't be one with us staying elsewhere, we have chosen not to attend any of them, and at any point from now on, sil has the dogs we will no longer attend. Any tantrums. Manipulation. Guilt trips will result in a time out from my family having any contact, including updates and pictures. \n\nI will not have my children around people family or not who place the wants of one person over the safety of others. Especially a child. You made this choice, and this is the consequences of your choice. My children's safety will never be up for debate. How much interaction you all have with my children will depend on your choices. \n\n\nEnjoy your vacation as this is no longer up for debate or to be discussed.\n\n\nSend and inform hubby you are done. That the moment they placed sil wants ovr the kids, safety was the moment they lost any right to you or the kids. How long that lasts is up to how much they change but at this point no apology or them making changes will ever make you go on vacation with then again as they have proven to be untrustworthy with your children's safety. Period. \n\nThis is a hill to die on.", "NTA, it\u2019s for sure the hill to make a stand on, that way you can come and go as you like. Book it regardless of what they end up planning, find exactly what you want.", "NTA ask your husband what the point of the vacation would be if his family - as in his wife and children - are cramped, miserable and scared the whole time? This is not decision with only two options, you going with the dogs in the left over room vs you not going at all. They are just trying to make it seem like that so they get what they want.  There are lots of compromises, including what you suggested - \n\n1) you get your own place nearby\n2) you pick a place with a layout and rooms that would make you comfortable and feel safe (might not exist)\n3) SIL doesn\u2019t bring her dogs\n4) SIL gets another place for her family to stay at with her dogs \n5) your family stays home but MIL and SIL get a vacation together (not unlike you had last year)\n6) everybody stays home because apparently if they can\u2019t have everything their way, they want nothing.", "NTA.

The poor kid is your responsibility, and you can not sacrifice his sense of security to appease the ILs. What an awful thought, what the ILs want a toddler to endure for them.\n\nI think it's also weird that so many families are in the habit of booking insufficient accommodations. They make sure that one or two special couples are happy and then nobody else matters- they get stuffed into tiny spaces or on couches and are supposed to be happy with it, instead of getting enough space for everyone. \n\nThe MIL and FIL have a non-negotiable condition of getting the big room. It's time for the OP and DH to also have a non-negotiable of a safe environment and enough space. Getting a separate rental is an excellent way to ensure this.", "*< Well\u2026 MIL was not happy about that >*\n\nOd course she wasn't.\n\nBecause with your monetary participation being spend on your own rental (good for you), she'll have to pay the full price herself.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You too can have an ensuite.", "NTA\n\nUnder no circumstances would I stay with dogs that have already bitten someone and showed other aggressive behaviour, especially if I had children.\n\nThe fact your in-laws considered it ok to take the largest bedroom with en-suite but expect you and your husband and two kids two share what I imagine is a double bedroom with 2 cots is disgusting. They are two people that are demanding the largest bedroom with en-suite and you have to be two adults and two little ones in one bedroom, especially considering you contribute, whilst SIL and husband, who don't contribute, get a much largest space so their family (including their dangerous dogs) have space?\n\nF that noise. Don't go. Just the fact that they are bringing aggressive dogs to a trip is a good-enough reason to pull out from this. If you already paid your contribution, see if you can get that charged/deposited back by your bank. Just don't go on this trip. FIL and MIL don't care about you at all because you got the 'scraps' of the accommodation. They are prioritising people who do not pay and who bring their dangerous dogs to a family vacation over you guys (who are paying and are not bringing dangerous dogs). It's clear who is the favourite and it isn't you/your partner. Why even go on a holiday with people who don't care about your needs/safety/comfort?\n\nPut your kids first: avoid being around these dogs at all cost.\n\nPS: It's not just the danger these dogs pose to you and your kids. It's also the lack of comfort of having to always be vigilant (even if somehow, the dogs do not attack anyone on this holiday). And I assume they intend to bring the dogs to whatever activities you have planned for the day, or will they crate these dogs in a house that isn't their home for the whole day (which would be stressful and cruel towards the dogs)? When the dogs come out on your daily activities, be prepared for the dogs to be refused entry to places, for the dogs to be difficult, and for other people avoiding you. I love dogs but even if you have a well-behaved (small) dog, there's a lot of places you can't bring your dog to like most shops and restaurants. Dogs aren't allowed on many beaches or not off leash. Your holiday is going to center around catering to these dogs. And what if these dogs attack a member of the public? Do you want to be around for that or to be caught up in the chaos? If you are in England/Wales (you might need to check if you are in Scotland or NI what the law is there) and these dogs may fit the description for any of the five banned breeds (the XL bully was very recently added), you could consider taking action if you fear for the safety of your SIL's kids or members of the public.", "NTA.  Fuck the entire we NEEEEEED to vacation together bs.  Go on a vacation with your immediate family and screw all that drama", "Going to be blunt?  Next time they bite, report to animal control and sue for damages.  Maybe that will teach SIL to control and train her hounds.", "Bc OP and her family are subsidizing the trip for the rest of the family.  If they stay somewhere else, MIL will have to pay for all of SIL's vacation.", "Because OP and her family are helping pay for the accommodations.", "She is definitely NTA for several reasons however I just took my two sons, daughter in law and 4 and 5 year old on a vacation that was wonderful for all. Dogs were boarded or left with other relatives. These can be great experiences for all if people are considerate of each other.", "My thoughts go to the bully dogs.  Since they are aggressive and were there first, I would worry about the safety of SiL's infant.  They could develop a jealousy of the attention the baby is getting and that could lead to disaster.", ">Those dogs will probably cause damage and you\u2019ll end up having to pay a damage waiver.\n\nFor me this would be the best case scenario... I'm concerned about a person getting hurt. But this is also a pretty big issue. My cousin had a German Shepherd that got into the house while they were out (very untrained dog so not really it's fault) and destroyed the sofa utterly and completely. Does OP and/or MIL have the money to pay for something the dogs damage?", "We have always contributed financially to the trip, particularly towards accommodations. She would not be expected to pay for us to have a separate place.", "I get that in this instance, I was speaking more generally. I know or hear about so many people that do this, but I just think it sucks. I just like to be left alone on vacation.", "Why will the vacation not happen if there\u2019s two places?  It seems that would be the most healthy arrangement.", "Because without OP subsidizing the family rental, MIL and company don't/can't afford it.", "Ah. I missed this. I thought MIL was paying the most, and OP and husband helping."]}
