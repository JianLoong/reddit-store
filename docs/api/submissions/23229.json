Not her wedding, not her spotlight, not her place to blow shit up. Please tell her to arrange another appropriate time to come out to your grandparents. She is not limited to only your wedding to meet them right?", "Ok general rule you don\u2019t go to a wedding as a guest and try to make any kind of announcement unless the bride and groom are both cool about it. It\u2019s about your marriage not her need to express her sexuality. It would be the same level of self centered behavior as announcing an engagement, a pregnancy, etc. It has nothing to do with what she\u2019s trying to say. It\u2019s that she\u2019s using your wedding to draw attention to herself. Basically if it\u2019s not your wedding you are a BACK UP CHARACTER lol *edit to add NTA", "Why can't she inform them she is queer prior to your wedding if she wants them to know?\n\nI'm gonna go with NTA. It's your wedding day, you don't want family drama taking away from the day and that is understandable. I think you should talk to your sister about telling your grandparents about it all before the wedding so there isn't a scene or fight during your reception. The fact that your sister WANTS to tell them at your wedding knowing it will upset them, would make me rethink having her at the wedding if it were my sibling.", "NTA\n\nYou (and your partner?) want to have good memories of your wedding. Everyone else already knows, and sis's partner won't be there.\n\n It's puzzling that your sis would have to lie anyway. She'd just be asked not to announce her partner's gender to the grands. Is that right?\n\nSis says she doesn't care if her announcement becomes the main object of negative attention at your wedding? In that case, tell her not to come if that's how she feels.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding isn't a appropriate time for this. She's forty years old, she should know better. The fact she doesn't would be enough for me to uninvited her because I wouldn't be able to trust them.", "Nope NTA. In fact, considering that you very much support her when the rest of the family doesn\u2019t, it makes me angry on your behalf that she refuses to not cause a big scene at your wedding, in fact it almost seems like she wants to use your wedding occasion to get on her soapbox and sing her queerness to the masses.\n\nThe problem is, your wedding is about you and your (soon to be) husband, not about her and she needs to understand this. There\u2019s nothing bigoted about wanting your wedding day not to be about the public affirmation your sister\u2019s sexuality. If she really wants your grandparents to know, she should go to see them and tell them beforehand, not use your wedding to make a statement. There\u2019s a time and a place for everything and your wedding is not the occasion.\n\nGood luck and I hope she doesn\u2019t ruin your day.\n\nP.S. Apparently, according to my gay children, queer relationships move at quadruple speed in comparison to straight relationships, so it\u2019s not uncommon to move towards getting engaged or married in double quick time, so please don\u2019t worry about the speed of her relationship\u2019s progression.", "NTA.

She knows how your family is, but unfortunately it seems like no matter what you say she intends to announce it at the wedding meaning that more than likely the festivities will turn into bickering and arguments. She realizes this and yet she still insists on it. She could tell your grandparents at some earlier date, but is choosing your wedding to do it. You on the other hand have a choice to make, you can\n1. Uninvite all family that would have an issue with your sister's sexuality so no fights will begin about it\n2. Uninvite your sister so she cannot mention it and prevent fighting about it\n3. Keep everyone on the invite list and just deal with the fighting \n4.

Your sister is TA; that's about as much of a dick move as people announcing pregnancies or proposing at your wedding.  It will steal the spotlight from you in the same exact way.  Why do they have to know she's gay?  Clearly her being gay has hogged up countless family conversations and even your personal conversations with them being your defense of your sister.\n\nNTA; people like her are why people are getting tired of LGBT people.

Then YTA.", "Yta for asking her to lie.  Of course she shouldn't turn your wedding into get coming out party, but you asking her to hide until after your wedding is a real jerk move.

Mennonites....conservative Mennonites. Know what they did when I came out as gay at age 30? In their homes, in private, they prayed for my soul. In public, they surrounded me with love and acceptance of me, as their sister who they love. One of my nephews who was in highschool used it as a pickup line, I recently found out.. he would go up to a girl and say, \"hey, my Aunt is a lesbian, let's talk about that\",  and off they'd go. They also accepted my partner. I am single now and will probably always be that, but I never had to lie about who I was. Tolerating and being complacent about bigotry IS being a bigot.

If coming out to them was something she deeply feels a need to do than she could have done it anytime before your wedding. She was willing to agree to your mother's request that she not say anything to them until now. So what has change. My guess is your sister  has probably always been a bit of an attention hog. However, I also think it is naive of you to think that you could invite your sister to your wedding with all of your SCARY conservative relatives who have already made their feelings clear about her coming out and there not be any drama. Even if your sister doesn't say anything do you really think your relatives won't make negative comments to her that will make her upset and possibly lead to an argument at your wedding.", "No, if it\u2019s that important to her to come out to them, then it\u2019s on her to figure out how to do it before your wedding.

Like, with the setup it does seem inevitable that it will come out SOMEHOW at SOME family gathering.\n\nAnyway, this all seems toxic and weird -- idk how she can even enjoy herself in this environment. I feel MAYBE like a mild yta because I can't imagine hanging out with so many homophobic people (regardless of how attention-seeking their target may be) who would act so ostracizing about someone's sexuality.That said, I'm sure the situation is nuanced and there's something to be said for meeting people where they're at. And being able to have control over your own wedding.  \n\nI honestly don't know if there is a path forward that lets you have a relationship with your sister, though. If you're sure she will cause a scene, I feel you are within your right to disinvite her but that decision is tied up with her identity whether you want it to be or not. Honestly from her perspective, I have no idea why she wants to associate with this extended family at all and if she were asking for advice I'd tell her to skip this wedding entirely.\n\nMy advice is to tell her she has to tell your grandparents ahead of time and that if she feels she will be confrontational, she will need to stay home. If she does attend, recruit an usher or neutral person to be in charge of ushering her out if she causes a scene. And if any of your family try to be weird/confrontational about her identity to you, shut it down asap. Pull a bride power move of saying it's your wedding and you get to decide who is invited and there are much more interesting and fun things to talk about.\n\nEDIT: Just saw your comment about how she is insisting the wedding has to be where she tells the grandparents due to it being in person. I would say it is absolutely non-negotiable she tells them ahead of time. Over Zoom, on a phone call, even maybe during some family get-together in the days before the wedding [at least in weddings I've been to there have been lots of people staying in the same hotel rooms, hanging out with each other during the days before the wedding, picking various people up from the airport, etc.] I think it's still a bit weird of you to have so many homophobic people in your life, but in this situation the person actively and intentionally causing conflict is your sister.", "NTA\n\nSimple question I would actually pose to her: why does she need to wait until the wedding? It\u2019s not crazy that she\u2019s tired of waiting for this, but kinda sounds like she\u2019s looking to make a scene. I would totally understand if this were about bringing her partner, but that is not the case so it\u2019s moot. If you ask her why she doesn\u2019t tell them in advance of the wedding and get the drama out of the way first, it defuses her accusation that you\u2019re asking her to delay. Best case scenario, maybe it forces her to reflect on why she wants to handle it like this.", "NTA.\n\nWhat's stopping her from picking up the phone and telling them NOW?

She spent so long hiding in the closet that stepping back into it in anyway (especially for the approval / comfort of those who kept her in) would feel like a massive regression and deeply in conflict with where she is in her journey. I fully understand how tired you must be and how you want just one drama-free day where you aren't shoved between a rock and a hard place... but I don't really think that's possible.

You deserve to have the weekend be about you!\n\nAs for coming out to your grandparents, with what you have said about them & the frequency your sister sees them, why is she so insistent in telling them right then and there? Why can\u2019t she just let it be and if it comes up then it comes up. If not, life continues status quo. I say this with zero intent on shamming for being queer. It is more about not causing drama.

Let alone people who are into guns and just have to let you know. \n\nStop being in your feelings so much and accept that gay people are people, which means they are annoying too.", "You mean like the countless posts about mothers who only talk about their kids (and bore the heck out of their single friends). Or girls who only want to talk about their boyfriends. Like that?", "There wouldn't be an issue in either community if bad behaviors were quelled. That's all I'm trying to say.", "No one is not blaming the family for being homophobic. They are blaming the sister for pretending phones don't exist so that she must come out at the most dramatic time possible.", "And saying \u201cthey\u201d will really be noticed by some incredibly old conservative grandparents who would never accept that for one of their grandkids? And you\u2019re thinking about/preparing for an 0.0001% chance scenario of something that wouldn\u2019t be the sister\u2019s fault, when the whole point of the post is the the sister not to try to draw attention to herself on OP\u2019s wedding day.", "Not true. I agree it isn\u2019t appropriate to expect the sister to outright lie but she could say she doesn\u2019t want to discuss it and sometimes straight people also need to say this\u2026like when I left my abusive husband and became single again everyone left me alone for like a year and then started asking about my dating life. And I didn\u2019t want to discuss that with them then.", "\"You shouldn't care that you've realized something really important about yourself, just do whatever and don't make a big deal out of it\" isn't really any better than \"you should be closeted.\"\n\nLet people feel their joy, dude. Shaming queer folx for being proud because you don't think it matters isn't really any better than doing it because you think it's gross.", "I didn\u2019t either!", "The biggest issue is that this 40yo woman let her mother dictate her relationships with other adults, and now she's running out of time to stand up for herself.\n\nESH.  Yeah, sister shouldn't announce at the wedding, but she shouldn't be asked to be dishonest, either.  If the bigots \"find out\" and make a scene, have venue security or the groom escort them out.  Problem removed, on with the party and celebration of love!", "If you don't understand the wildly vast difference between an intrinsic part of someone's being and liking trucks then you are legitimately too stupid to have any kind of productive conversation on this subject. If we held straight people to the same standard you held us, we'd be puking our fucking guts out 24/7 from how much heterosexuality is shoved in our faces", "I'm talking more about how (hetero)sexuality is so ingrained in our society. Heterosexuality is so celebrated and we're inundated with it 24/7, to the point where so many people can't even conceive the possibility they're queer until well into adulthood. Now **that's** shoving sexuality down people's throats", "My spouse is non-binary, so I know what it's like to try to try to play the pronoun game with extended family. It's hard and stressful, and if the sister doesn't want to do it I don't blame her.\n\nNone of this is this sister's fault.", "You can\u2019t know that. You literally cannot. And look at the post, the point is for the sister not to draw attention to herself on OP\u2019s wedding day. Let\u2019s consider both scenarios:\n\n1. Tell their grandparents before: the entire wedding is guaranteed to be extremely awkward between them creating a tense atmosphere\n\n2. Don\u2019t tell their grandparents: there\u2019s a *tiny* chance it comes out without her wanting to in which case it creates an awkward and tense atmosphere\n\nSo basically we have a scenario guaranteeing disaster, and a scenario that has a tiny chance to result in disaster. How can you possibly advocate for it? Also no they won\u2019t fucking say that since they don\u2019t accept her for that. They won\u2019t bring it up, because they don\u2019t support it. \u201cDon\u2019t be coy\u201d my ass.", "Is it because they\u2019re little Q\u2019s? I wanna know where that comes from!", "Holy fuck you are so emotional. It's not about seeing a gay couple hold hands, kiss, or appear in a fucking soup commercial. It is having a personality that revolves solely on one aspect of your being that gets annoying. \n\nBut I love how you picked the truck one to fit your ever present persecution narrative instead of the other two examples. It's not about some standard only for gay people but for everyone that is hyper obsessive of one thing to the exclusion of everything else.", "Maybe our definitions of thuggish are different, but I mean it to be violent or criminal behavior. So anybody can be thuggish, not just black people. It's an unfortunate reality that every time I see ring camera footage of people cherry picking cars in my neighborhood they are always black, but it's you who has already connected the word thug to black folks so maybe take a look at your own racism.", "Riots are never ok. Protests are and voicing your opinion is though.", "You might want to tell them to print the letters as they. No longer teach cursive in many schools. My MIL wrote my daughter a long letter and she couldn\u2019t read it herself because she never learned cursive.", "OP states that her immediate family and aunts and uncles know, that \u201calmost every convo I have with them\u201d turns into a discussion of the sister\u2019s sexuality. It\u2019s been six months and OP is planning a wedding and still this is the trending topic. Since the best indicator of future behavior is the past, there\u2019s no reason to think they won\u2019t be talking about it at the wedding.\n\nOP states that it isn\u2019t simply a reception, but a whole weekend. This is a whole weekend that she needs every single person that knows to keep it a secret\u2026including her two niblings. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s realistic to expect children not to bring up mom and (gf name) through an entire weekend of family time. It doesn\u2019t sound like mom is raising them to keep it a secret, nor would it be healthy to. \n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, sister has warned OP that if she is asked about her love life, she will not lie. \n\nMaybe OP gets lucky and it doesn\u2019t come out, gparents never ask, every single person who knows avoids even mentioning the gf but it seems like there\u2019s a good chance that the gparents learn and the initial reaction is at OPs wedding weekend. Let them have their meltdown in the comfort of their own home and compose themselves with etiquette when attending OP\u2019s wedding day.", "Did you miss the part where OP said almost every conversation in the last 6 months has led back to the sister being gay, even if sister isn't present?", "The product was originally called \u2019Q-tips baby gays\u2019. They were marketed for baby care and, apparently, they made the founders baby laugh when tickled (hence the gay part).", ">It's not about seeing a gay couple hold hands, kiss, or appear in a fucking soup commercial.\n\nYeah I got some bad news for you on that front: for a shitload of people it is", "I am still confused, because YOU are the one who mentioned the word thuggish in the context of labeling black people, not me. You are the one who said being thuggish is a stereotype of black people. I am not connecting anything. I am saying labeling black people as \"thuggish\" comes across as racist.", "How do you feel about the Revolutionary War? It is essentially one big riot to be free from UK. lol. I bet you support that, huh?", "What does this comment have to do with the fact that Aldean filmed this specific music video where a notorious lynching occurred?", "I was actually thinking as I typed that that my dad\u2019s handwriting is atrocious. He does print though and I bet he put extra care into writing it legibly. My mom writes in beautiful calligraphy, like she\u2019s been paid to address wedding invitations lots of times. It\u2019s sort of hybrid cursive/print but I imagine it\u2019ll be easy enough. If not I guess my sister can help.", "because it\u2019s with her fucking sister and everybody knows OP is the only person who supports her", "I made it very clear what my definition of thuggish is. Now apply that definition to my very first statement. It's not racist to call out bad behavior within your community so that it doesn't look bad", "Not wanting to pay an unjust tax to a government is a bit different from throwing a hissy fit because someone who puts guns up to women's pregnant bellies got killed by a police officer.", "Are people not allowed to do anything on the land where a horrible tragedy took place. Most of the world would be off limits by that logic?", "So you don't think at the wedding, where the sister will literally be, that the conversation won't go to that at some point? Even if the sister doesn't bring it up at all herself?\n\nAlso, maybe the sister would've told the grandparents awhile ago when she came out to everyone, but as OP said, \n\n>\" My mother\u2019s one request when my sister came out to them was that she not share this part of herself with my grandparents \"\n\nThey are now in this situation because the family was trying to control who the sister could be out to. Is she expected to hide this part of her life during every family even to keep the peace? I know this is just the wedding itself, but she could've already been out to everyone if the mother didn't force her to stay not out to the grandparents. \n\nIt doesn't sound like the sister is using the wedding as a coming out party. It sounds like she isn't willing to lie about her life anymore if she is asked. It wouldn't be a problem for her to talk about her new partner if the partner was a guy.", "Nice strawman. I am not talking to you anymore. lol."]}
