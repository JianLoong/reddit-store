I (F36) met my husband (M45) when I was 21 and he was 31. He had just arrived in my country, and started working as head chef at the restaurant where I was a waitress.\n\nWe flirted heavily and had some great conversations about things I couldn't really talk to my peers about, like religion used as a political tool, cultural differences across Europe, classical vs current literature, historical views on women's and children's rights etc.\n\nI made the first move. He hadn't because he felt the age difference might be inappropriate. Once the ball got rolling he was all in though. We met in July 2009, he proposed in October 2009. In April 2010 I got pregnant, and we got married in June 2010 (unrelated to the pregnancy).\n\nAs all couples do, we've had ups and downs. Ups are the two children we have. Downs mainly being discovering the brain tumor I have. It's beneign-ish, but messes with my hormones a lot, it gives me frequent migraines, I have memory issues, cognitive functions are sometimes messed up and I have an increased need for sleep. On top of that, we also found out that I'm bipolar and I have PTSD. I am fully medicated, and have been stable for many years now, and the PTSD has minimal influence on our daily lives. I do stay at home though, and get disability due to the tumor.\n\nTo make up for me having a lower income, my husband works a lot. He changed careers and is now working in a very demanding field in another city which means that he's staying at a hotel from Sunday to Thursday, working 12-13 hour shifts. It's tough without him here, but I manage. When he's at home, we share household chores and childcare 50/50.\n\nMy friend's husband is a pos. He has cheated on her multiple times in the 4 years they've been together, he does nothing around the house, and she rarely gets out because he refuses to do childcare. She has left him many times but keeps going back for reasons unknown. \n\nShe does love to complain about him though, and is frustrated that I don't complain about my husband. Last weekend, she kept digging into things, calling him a cradle robber, insinuating that he was grooming and abusing me because I was so young when we met, and because I'm disabled, but the last drop was her accusing him of cheating on me when he's away from home.\n\nI lost it a bit and told her that just because her husband and her marriage sucks, she doesn't get to talk shit about mine to make herself feel better and that if she hates her marriage, she should just end it instead of using it as bitching material. Also, 14 fucking years later is a bit late to be showing concern.

You wouldn\u2019t have as much relationship experience so you wouldn\u2019t recognize red flags as easily and fall into toxic relationships easier.

They mostly say that because the older you get the more relationship experience you get and you know what red flags to look out for.\n\nBut while a 10 year age difference being a red flag is a rule there are exceptions to every rule.

(I know exactly when maturity landed on me - I was 22, and hosting a dinner party where some stuff occurred that even the day before would have sent me into a rage, but I realized in that exact moment that no one was being intentionally cruel - they were just focused on their own selves and feelings, and meant zero disrespect to me. It was just that everyone was the star of their own movie, and weren't thinking about the effect it would have on the hostess.)  \n\n\nSo NTA, because it's not your fault she pushed your buttons till she got a negative reaction, and then was surprised that there was a reaction.

Nta, but your friend is.", "This post is such obvious bait about the age gap issue.", "NTA. Your husband sounds like a loving, kind, supportive man. There aren't too many of them. Misery loves company and I'd get rid of the friend trying to poison your marriage. She has shown disgusting disrespect to your husband and has malevolent intentions to drag you down with her. \n\nCut, block and go tell your husband how much you love and appreciate him.", "NTA - she\u2019s projecting her unhappiness onto you to try and make herself feel better by dragging you down to her level so she\u2019s not alone.", "NTA. If you were 16 when your husband was 26 when you met, I\u2019d be concerned. But you were 21 and met organically, there\u2019s no reason to claim you were groomed. \n\nAs for her seeming to be upset that you don\u2019t have reason to complain. It sounds like she might be in an abusive situation. I was like that- had a SO that I often complained about for things like I couldn\u2019t ask him to buy toilet paper or he\u2019d steal the industrial stuff from his work. I didn\u2019t tell my friends about the actually abusive shit he did, not even when he punched my jaw while I was driving. My friends didn\u2019t like him because they knew he was a POS, they just didn\u2019t know the full of extent of it. So maybe instead of just snapping at her, encourage her to leave and stay gone. Ask her why she won\u2019t leave. Ask her if she needs help leaving. Her behavior towards you is unacceptable, but if you value her and the friendship I encourage you to encourage her to leave.", "NTA!

She is transferring her frustrations and unhappiness to you.  It's not necessarily that she wants your marriage to fail, but she probably has no one to talk to or have anyone that relates to her.

Otherwise, you don't need to keep negativity in your life.", "From your story you initiated the relationship, you have helped evolve the dynamic of the relationship and you are happy.

She pushed and pushed for a reaction, and then gave shocked Pikachu face when she got it. Misery loves company, and she's projecting the issues with her relationship to try and make herself feel better that other people are just as miserable, instead of taking stock of her situation and deciding what to do. It makes sense - it probably feels more comfortable to tell yourself that everyone else's relationship is just as dysfunctional so you don't have to hold that mirror too close, but it's not doing her any favors.\n\nA lot of people see large age gaps as a red flag, so it's easy shot to take, but her comments were pretty hideous. What if you had experienced grooming or abuse in your current situation or another one, or were being cheated on? What if you needed help? How would that kind of judgment and nastiness be helpful? If she wanted to talk about how unhappy she is, she needs to grow up and talk about \\*her\\* situation without casting assumptions about other people's relationships. It doesn't sound like she's a great friend at all. She's the one who crossed a line. Consider if this is someone you really want as a friend. It sounds like she's deeply unhappy, but that doesn't mean she gets to take it out on you. If she wants support, she needs to talk about her feelings rather than lashing out. If you do want to fight for the friendship, you could say that you're concerned she's feeling unhappy and ask if she wants to talk, but I'd suggest also putting up a clear boundary and saying that you want to listen and help but not if she says hurtful things about your relationship.", "NTA. She\u2019s probably jealous and wants someone to share in her misery. \n\nBut I do find it amusing that you justified the age gap by saying you were different from your peers because you wanted to have deep salient discussions.
