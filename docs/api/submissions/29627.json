{"id": 29627, "submission_id": "17g29c6", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that just because her marriage sucks, mine doesn't have to?", "selftext": "Okay, I know that from the outside, my marriage looks kinda dubious, at least the start of it does. I (F36) met my husband (M45) when I was 21 and he was 31. He had just arrived in my country, and started working as head chef at the restaurant where I was a waitress.\n\nWe flirted heavily and had some great conversations about things I couldn't really talk to my peers about, like religion used as a political tool, cultural differences across Europe, classical vs current literature, historical views on women's and children's rights etc.\n\nI made the first move. He hadn't because he felt the age difference might be inappropriate. Once the ball got rolling he was all in though. We met in July 2009, he proposed in October 2009. In April 2010 I got pregnant, and we got married in June 2010 (unrelated to the pregnancy).\n\nAs all couples do, we've had ups and downs. Ups are the two children we have. Downs mainly being discovering the brain tumor I have. It's beneign-ish, but messes with my hormones a lot, it gives me frequent migraines, I have memory issues, cognitive functions are sometimes messed up and I have an increased need for sleep. On top of that, we also found out that I'm bipolar and I have PTSD. I am fully medicated, and have been stable for many years now, and the PTSD has minimal influence on our daily lives. I do stay at home though, and get disability due to the tumor.\n\nTo make up for me having a lower income, my husband works a lot. He changed careers and is now working in a very demanding field in another city which means that he's staying at a hotel from Sunday to Thursday, working 12-13 hour shifts. It's tough without him here, but I manage. When he's at home, we share household chores and childcare 50/50.\n\nMy friend's husband is a pos. He has cheated on her multiple times in the 4 years they've been together, he does nothing around the house, and she rarely gets out because he refuses to do childcare. She has left him many times but keeps going back for reasons unknown. \n\nShe does love to complain about him though, and is frustrated that I don't complain about my husband. Last weekend, she kept digging into things, calling him a cradle robber, insinuating that he was grooming and abusing me because I was so young when we met, and because I'm disabled, but the last drop was her accusing him of cheating on me when he's away from home.\n\nI lost it a bit and told her that just because her husband and her marriage sucks, she doesn't get to talk shit about mine to make herself feel better and that if she hates her marriage, she should just end it instead of using it as bitching material. Also, 14 fucking years later is a bit late to be showing concern. Then I left.\n\nI'm pretty sure I crossed a line as she isn't currently speaking to me.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698232163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g29c6/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_just_because_her/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But 21 and 31 would usually have an unbalanced power dynamic.\n\nAt 21 you are just starting out, you might even be in college still. You wouldn\u2019t have as much relationship experience so you wouldn\u2019t recognize red flags as easily and fall into toxic relationships easier.

I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say they won\u2019t anyone under that age because there is a noticeable maturity difference.\n\n31 you would be already established in a career, so you usually would be making more. You would be more settled in life with savings and an established home. And people like to say that if you\u2019re older and dating someone that much younger than you it\u2019s because you can\u2019t get anyone your age to date you. They mostly say that because the older you get the more relationship experience you get and you know what red flags to look out for.\n\nBut while a 10 year age difference being a red flag is a rule there are exceptions to every rule.
