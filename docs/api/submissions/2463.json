She had surgery scheduled for two days before my due date, husband asked who was driving her she laughed and said you of course. He said he needed to be available in case I went into labor & suggested she try to find someone else. She screamed at him that he is all she has & if he can\u2019t take her she has no way to get there and home. I ended up getting induced the day of her surgery, husband called his uncle (MILs brother) who was more than happy to drive her.

Question, why do you not feel any guilt or remorse about my holidays being ruined?\u201d", "NTA. Hell no. Your husband needs a date with a marriage counselor. I'd be crystal clear with him that this is a hill you're marriage is going to die on.

He was raised by a manipulative bully and he's got a long way to go in terms of separation.", "NTA. This is the hill to die on. There has to be a compromise where she can come over for dinner on Christmas afternoon or something, but to try to get an open invitation to spend every Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day with your family until the end of time is a hard no.

Don\u2019t give it up.", "NTA\n\nYou guys are your own unit now and should actually take precedence over MIL.

She can come over the afternoon of christmas and spend the rest of christmas day with your family but the morning belongs to you and the family.", "NTA- and I would respond to husband, No, you clearly do not understand because you are very deliberately going against my explicit wishes here. so let's be clear... you are unable to set any sort of boundaries with your mother and therefore your solution is to enable her to steamroll me with her barrage of inconsiderate and disrespectful behavior. The answer is \"no\", she will not be spending the night and you will be the one to deal with her on this basis. If you are able to condition her behavior throughout the year, then next year we can reconsider based on an actual history of modified behavior. Otherwise, I will just put the kids in the car and drive to my parents. She has no-one to blame but herself for her lack of manners and you, her son, for failing to set reasonable boundaries. I will no longer be paying the price for this.", "NTA. Your husband needs to listen to you and MIL needs to be shown what boundaries are. You seem to be asking for very little and he isn't even prepared to make an effort for that. This can't go on.", "NTA. Your husband asked what you thought and you told him. Holidays with divorced parents can be really hard. But ultimately you and your husband aren\u2019t responsible for making up for what your MIL feels she lacks. I know it\u2019s hard to have that conversation, but you need to spell it out that simply. You\u2019re entitled to this time with your family. Eventually your own kiddos are going to grow and so will their obligations. What\u2019s ironic to me is that, by her own actions, MIL is the reason nobody wants to have her around. And that\u2019s on her to fix.\n\nYour husband needs to back you on this and enforce healthy boundaries. His priorities should be his wife, his children, and THEN his mom. And where his mom fits shouldn\u2019t supersede YOUR parents but be equal.", "NTA\n\nThe answer is No. Absolutely No.\n\nMy MIL is similar to yours. She also invited herself over to spend Christmas Eve/Day overnight. It was awful - the kids were up at 5am, she told us to \"hold them off until she got up\" - which ended up being 2 hours later. It just ruined Christmas morning for all of us. After that, we let her know she could come after present opening, because this was about the children, not about her.\n\nYour husband is so used to MIL that to him this is \"normal\". But it's not normal - you decide the Christmas celebration your family has. Your MIL had her family moments when her husband was a child, now it's your turn, and she can come for lunch or brunch. It is not your husband's job to make sure his mother doesn't \"wake up alone\" - it IS his job to make Christmas for those few magical years your kids believe in Santa to be happy ones for you and them. YOU'RE his family - remember that whole \"*leave and cleave\"* thing.\n\nThis was a hill of mine to die on, and my husband needed to learn that MIL's \"requests\" were not commands I had to fulfill. She can come for Christmas lunch or dinner. She won't be \"alone\" that day - she is perfectly capable of waiting a few hours.\n\nI would also insist on counseling if your husband refuses to do this.", "NTA. Husband needs to understand moments like Christmas morning/Eve should be reserved for just you 4 to spend that special quality time together.

Invite her to come over after breakfast but be firm with your husband. Also, you need to speak up for your own family. They deserve holiday time with you as well.

It sounds like she's too much.  \n\nLots of people wake up alone on Christmas, particularly if they're spending it with people close by.

You should have insisted from back when you and your husband got serious enough to spend holidays together that you would alternate holidays between your family and his.  Part of the trade off of getting Grandkids is that you have to expect you're only going to get them half the holidays, because there are other Grandparents or other relatives involved.  That's if you're nearby.  If not, like us, you might not get them at all once the Grandkids are older and have part-time job commitments when they're off school.

Die on this Hill OP.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019ll ruin your holiday. \nAsk your husband why that\u2019s ok with him. \n\nIf she stays go somewhere else with the kids.", "Your husband needs to grow a spine and stop prioritizing his first family over his new nuclear family. He also needs to recognize that he is being manipulated by his mother, and that his mother is not treating you with the respect you deserve.  This is a nice clear boundary and he (guessing it was her idea) is not recognizing how important it is for you. NTA", "NTA", "You see her EVERY DAMNED WEEK.", "NTA...  How about she stays over and YOU take the kids and spend it with your family.  Win win\n\nThe answer is no... She is a guest in your house and needs to be more respectful, because she can't do that, then there's no reason to have her spend more time then is absolutely necessary.  Also as a family and because it's important to YOU to have your own family traditions, you will continue to do it, as you have been..  \n\nSay NO", "I suggest you post over at r/JUSTNOMIL ,  you\u2019ll  find  experience  &  support  there.  Oh  and  for  the  love  of  dog  put  some  paragraphs  in  please!", "OP, your MIL needs to get her own life, her own friends, her own interests that don\u2019t include your husband.  You say it\u2019s as if she\u2019s pushing you aside and taking your place - there\u2019s no \u201cseems\u201d about it, that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing.  She needs to get her own life and stop pushing into yours.  There needs to be a reckoning with her.  I feel for your husband, this will be hard for him but it has to be done.  This behavior of hers isn\u2019t sustainable.", "NTA your husband doesn\u2019t get to steal these precious Christmases from you to give to his mom OP.", "NTA, I agree with you completely. However, consider this compromise. You have Christmas Eve and Christmas morning with the kids, do presents and pictures and all that, then maybe invite MIL over for coffee/lunch for an hour or two? Everyone gets what they want and everyone\u2019s happy.", "NTA\n\nPlease show this post and replies to your husband.", "Christmas morning in my house is a HARD NO. No one is allowed. That is our family time, it's one of the few boundaries I've set. There was one year I did invite my parents over for Christmas dinner, and they wanted to stay Christmas eve and I said no. It's one of the few times I had a backbone to my parents and my goodness was it a shitshow! That is family time. You already give up so much of your own family during the holidays and your husband wants it to be every year? HARD pass. NTA.", "NTA\nOp, your Mil's emotional issues are not your responsibility. Read that again, please, Your mother in law's emotions are NOT your responsibility.  Stop feeling guilty for saying \"NO!\"  \n\nTell your husband he needs to to keep \"NO!\" in his back pocket too. If MIL can't be respectful,  then she doesn't need to be around. Now is a really good time to lessen contact and let her know it doesn't matter the season,  your house your rules. \nBest of luck going forward.", "Nta. Nope. Nope. Nope. She can see you for lunch Christmas day.", "NTA She is at your house every week. I think you are being tolerant enough with MIL. Stand your ground. Your husband needs to support you. His mother lives the way she does because your husband enables her. Adn yes, she is trying to usurp your position in your own family. She is an adult and needs to act like one. I'm not saying don't see her on the holiday but stop by her home after your private family gathering. No need for every Christmas for you has to be miserable.", "NTA. Tell him you are going to start having your family for a week, after all they are your family. Let him go stay Christmas Eve with her and she doesn't need to be there for opening presents.", "NTA and you should take this over to r/JustNoMIL.", "You are NTA. Your husband sounds as though he's very enmeshed with her. She's a grownup. Of course she can wake up alone on Christmas morning and then get all excited to come and see you guys. \n\nHold the line if you can. It sounds as though unless you do, you can expect to see him moving her in with you some day.", "If you allow this once, it becomes a \"tradition\" and you'll have to fight this battle every year. Put your foot down HARD. It's not fun for the kids either - they know when you aren't happy.", "Why are you subjecting your children to someone who treats people you love like this? Does having your mother around make you that happy?\n\n NTA\nr/motherinlawsfromhell\nr/JustNoMIL", "Also take a peek at r/JUSTNOMIL see if anything sounds familiar there.", "Thanks for the award, kind redditor!", "This \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb!", "I like this.", "Yes!  All of this is reasonable and appropriate.  You and  your family's interests need to be given priority.", "Perhaps you could offer to set aside one gift for each of the children \\[or maybe the stockings\\] to open with MIL when she arrives later in the morning. That way, she can have the pleasure of opening gifts with the kids without it taking over your pleasure in doing so.", "No.  You want time with your family that is not consumed by your MIL's needs.  This isn't just about holidays and how they are experienced.  This is about you being the door mat on which your MIL and your husband are living their best life with complete disregard for your feelings.", "What is stopping your husband from planning for and hosting his mother?\n\nETA: You don\u2019t need his permission to take a break. Simply refuse to play hostess this year.", "She can choose to be a nice person and make friends, not be so hateful that she\u2019s driven off her entire family and has no friends.", "I might be missing something but I don\u2019t see how he\u2019s good at enforcing boundaries with her. It seems like his method of enforcing boundaries is guilting you into doing what she wants so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with it.", "What his mother is going to do is up to her as an independent adult with a variety of options and plenty of resources.", "How exactly is he getting out of hosting these holidays? Are you okay with it being foisted on you, especially since it's his mother who is the reason...\n\nif you were free to come and go, you could potentially spend part of the day with your family and get the kids out from underfoot, and come back to celebrate since he's insistent on hosting.", "Time to get confrontational. If you do not stop this now, it will continue to for the rest of your life, or until she really pushes a boundary and you snap. I would straight up ask him if he is married to his mom or me. She can be included in the holidays, but she doesn't get to dictate the holidays. You should not miss out seeing your family because hubby can't cut the cord. \n\nI agree with others- counseling, pronto. If he refuses, then pack up the kids, go stay with your folks for the holidays and let him see what he's pushing you to. \n\nNTA", "Honestly it sounds like you should do a 3 year rotation schedule; \n\nExample: \n\nYear one: Easter just you 4, Thanksgiving with your family, Christmas with his mother \n\nYear two: Easter with your family, Thanksgiving with his mother,  Christmas just you 4\n\nYear three: Easter with his mother, Thanksgiving just you 4, Christmas with your family \n\nIf the kids like holidays with your MIL it might be the fairest compromise", "Yeah, that was kinda hard to read and I hope OP's okay- seeking permission to spend time with your own family with whom you're on good terms because your husband is such a big vote and determining factor of what your family of two adults and children decides? Ouch", "Especially with OP saying she has another option, her own siblings ... she just *chooses* not to. Given her behavior, I wonder if they also *choose* if she's invited.", "I was actually wondering the same thing.  If it were me, I would make arrangements to go to my parents (and see if I could spend the night) with the kids and leave him and mummy dearest to figure it out themselves.  Sometimes the best defense is a good offense!", "This is great advice. He wants to be with his mother so much, he can. Op can take the kids and see her family that she misses so much. Sounds like a good compromise. He can host, she can see family."]}
