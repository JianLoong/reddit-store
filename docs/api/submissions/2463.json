She had surgery scheduled for two days before my due date, husband asked who was driving her she laughed and said you of course. He said he needed to be available in case I went into labor & suggested she try to find someone else. She screamed at him that he is all she has & if he can\u2019t take her she has no way to get there and home. I ended up getting induced the day of her surgery, husband called his uncle (MILs brother) who was more than happy to drive her. Just a little insight into how difficult she can be.\nI always host the holidays because MIL wants us to spend them all with her so I end up missing out on seeing my family a lot in order to be home to host.

Question, why do you not feel any guilt or remorse about my holidays being ruined?\u201d", "NTA. Hell no. Your husband needs a date with a marriage counselor. I'd be crystal clear with him that this is a hill you're marriage is going to die on. You're already sacrificing too much of your own family time and she clearly has plenty of close sibling options for xmas eve. \n\nThe new rule is even years, she gets xmas day only, 12-5 and you do xmas eve at home.

He was raised by a manipulative bully and he's got a long way to go in terms of separation.", "NTA. This is the hill to die on. There has to be a compromise where she can come over for dinner on Christmas afternoon or something, but to try to get an open invitation to spend every Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day with your family until the end of time is a hard no.

Nobody should be all alone all of Christmas but she doesn\u2019t need to be there the whole time.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely deserve quiet time with your family on Christmas. Put your foot down hard.

Don\u2019t give it up.", "NTA\n\nYou guys are your own unit now and should actually take precedence over MIL. She IS trying to horn in on your Christmas morning and if you don't stop this now, all your Christmas mornings will be ruined. It's MIL s fault that she can't do mornings with yall. She doesn't play well with others ant that's not your problem.", "NTA.  If it is a choice between your happiness or your MIL's happiness your husband should be picking you 10 times out of 10.

She can come over the afternoon of christmas and spend the rest of christmas day with your family but the morning belongs to you and the family.", "NTA- and I would respond to husband, No, you clearly do not understand because you are very deliberately going against my explicit wishes here. so let's be clear... you are unable to set any sort of boundaries with your mother and therefore your solution is to enable her to steamroll me with her barrage of inconsiderate and disrespectful behavior. The answer is \"no\", she will not be spending the night and you will be the one to deal with her on this basis. If you are able to condition her behavior throughout the year, then next year we can reconsider based on an actual history of modified behavior. Otherwise, I will just put the kids in the car and drive to my parents. She has no-one to blame but herself for her lack of manners and you, her son, for failing to set reasonable boundaries. I will no longer be paying the price for this.", "NTA. Your husband needs to listen to you and MIL needs to be shown what boundaries are. You seem to be asking for very little and he isn't even prepared to make an effort for that. This can't go on.", "NTA. Your husband asked what you thought and you told him. Holidays with divorced parents can be really hard. But ultimately you and your husband aren\u2019t responsible for making up for what your MIL feels she lacks. I know it\u2019s hard to have that conversation, but you need to spell it out that simply. You\u2019re entitled to this time with your family. Eventually your own kiddos are going to grow and so will their obligations. What\u2019s ironic to me is that, by her own actions, MIL is the reason nobody wants to have her around. And that\u2019s on her to fix.\n\nYour husband needs to back you on this and enforce healthy boundaries. His priorities should be his wife, his children, and THEN his mom. And where his mom fits shouldn\u2019t supersede YOUR parents but be equal.", "NTA\n\nThe answer is No. Absolutely No.\n\nMy MIL is similar to yours. She also invited herself over to spend Christmas Eve/Day overnight. It was awful - the kids were up at 5am, she told us to \"hold them off until she got up\" - which ended up being 2 hours later. It just ruined Christmas morning for all of us. After that, we let her know she could come after present opening, because this was about the children, not about her.\n\nYour husband is so used to MIL that to him this is \"normal\". But it's not normal - you decide the Christmas celebration your family has. Your MIL had her family moments when her husband was a child, now it's your turn, and she can come for lunch or brunch. It is not your husband's job to make sure his mother doesn't \"wake up alone\" - it IS his job to make Christmas for those few magical years your kids believe in Santa to be happy ones for you and them. YOU'RE his family - remember that whole \"*leave and cleave\"* thing.\n\nThis was a hill of mine to die on, and my husband needed to learn that MIL's \"requests\" were not commands I had to fulfill. She can come for Christmas lunch or dinner. She won't be \"alone\" that day - she is perfectly capable of waiting a few hours.\n\nI would also insist on counseling if your husband refuses to do this.", "NTA. Husband needs to understand moments like Christmas morning/Eve should be reserved for just you 4 to spend that special quality time together.

Invite her to come over after breakfast but be firm with your husband. Also, you need to speak up for your own family. They deserve holiday time with you as well.

It sounds like she's too much.  \n\nLots of people wake up alone on Christmas, particularly if they're spending it with people close by.  Most couples want alone time with their children in the final hours of waiting for Santa on Christmas Eve after early religious service and when they all first wake up Christmas morning.

You should have insisted from back when you and your husband got serious enough to spend holidays together that you would alternate holidays between your family and his.  Part of the trade off of getting Grandkids is that you have to expect you're only going to get them half the holidays, because there are other Grandparents or other relatives involved.  That's if you're nearby.  If not, like us, you might not get them at all once the Grandkids are older and have part-time job commitments when they're off school.
