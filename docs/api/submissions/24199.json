I was kinda annoyed he didn\u2019t asked me first but whatever, I said okay, next time,ask me if I\u2019m okay with it first.\n\nAfter coming home from work the same day, he tells me that he invited two of his colleagues and that they\u2019ll come with their wives and kids. They have one kid each so that\u2019ll make 2 more children. \n\nI got upset when he told me this because 1. He invited 6 more people without asking me first, again, and 2. He told me that I needed to make a different dish for his colleagues\u2019s kids because they won\u2019t like what I\u2019m planning to cook. \n\nI told my boyfriend that he needed to be the one cooking because I didn\u2019t want to anymore. He asks me why as I initially agreed to cook. \n\nI said I initially agreed to cook for 4 people not 15. I added that it\u2019ll be easier for him to cook for 15 people anyways because he has his whole afternoon free while I\u2019d be working until 4pm. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t agree tho and thinks it\u2019s unfair of me to have agreed to cook just to take it back last minute. \n\nI said I\u2019d be okay to help with the kids\u2019 food once I come back from work but he needed to do the rest.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to and even threatened to cancel the whole thing if I wasn\u2019t cooking. \n\nAm I the AH there?
