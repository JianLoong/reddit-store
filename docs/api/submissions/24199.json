I was kinda annoyed he didn\u2019t asked me first but whatever, I said okay, next time,ask me if I\u2019m okay with it first.\n\nAfter coming home from work the same day, he tells me that he invited two of his colleagues and that they\u2019ll come with their wives and kids. They have one kid each so that\u2019ll make 2 more children. \n\nI got upset when he told me this because 1. He invited 6 more people without asking me first, again, and 2. He told me that I needed to make a different dish for his colleagues\u2019s kids because they won\u2019t like what I\u2019m planning to cook. \n\nI told my boyfriend that he needed to be the one cooking because I didn\u2019t want to anymore. He asks me why as I initially agreed to cook. \n\nI said I initially agreed to cook for 4 people not 15. I added that it\u2019ll be easier for him to cook for 15 people anyways because he has his whole afternoon free while I\u2019d be working until 4pm. \n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t agree tho and thinks it\u2019s unfair of me to have agreed to cook just to take it back last minute. \n\nI said I\u2019d be okay to help with the kids\u2019 food once I come back from work but he needed to do the rest.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to and even threatened to cancel the whole thing if I wasn\u2019t cooking. \n\nAm I the AH there?

Or, he can uninvite people. Or, he can call people and cancel.", "He changed the conditions of the agreement,  so you did too.", "NTA. He is", "Just go out to dinner with that original couple. Leave BF and others to fend for themselves. NTA", "This isn\u2019t an advice sub.", "NTA.  He can help cook and/OR order takeout.", "NTA, he sucks", "NTA\n\nIf he cancels, that's on him.\n\nTell him to order food for the dinner party if he isn't up to cooking at least 6 different dishes, if not more, based on all the kids who are now coming.\n\nBetter yet, just go to a restaurant because that is clearly what he has in mind if he thinks making each child a separate meal is a reasonable request to make of you.", "You should be the one cancelling the whole thing. NTA. Your boutfriend sucks too hard.", "NTA, that\u2019s super rude and something the he needs to ask about beforehand if he\u2019s not the one cooking. Also does the other couple know that it\u2019s no longer a dinner of 4? Because if somebody invited me/partner to eat, I would expect it to be a nice chill dinner for 4 and would be pretty annoyed at there being like 15 people altogether, like I need headcount for things lol", "NTA. I\u2019d be experiencing \u2018sudden\u2019 work emergency that requires overtime that night. \n\nAnd then I\u2019d be having a Serious conversation with him about the relationship, boundaries and basic respect.", "NTA. Judging from your comments, you need to cool it on this relationship - stop living together, stop hosting parties together.", "NTA. You cook for yourself and the original couple invited. Tell your bf since he invited the additional 11 people without asking you first, he is in charge of dealing with food for them and himself along with dining arrangements. He can cook, order take-out or take them out to eat. If he cooks or orders take out, he needs to figure out where in the  house/apartment they will eat since you and the original couple will be eating in the dining room. Whatever he does, he needs to be out of the kitchen by the time you get home so you can finish preparations for you and your guests.", "nta on top of springing it on you the day before when you said not to invite more\u2026. what about the vacation couple. why did he invite neighbors w kids to a dinner w them???   they don\u2019t have kids or at least aren\u2019t bringing them.  they agreed to dinner w u 2 not another couple they never met and their kids.  that\u2019s rude as fuck", "NTA literally no one thinks this is ok. \ud83d\ude02", "get dinner catered", "NTA.  Time for him to handle everything he just tried to volunteer you for.", "Your boyfriend is a massive asshole. He is happy to put a burden on you and then have a tantrum when asked to deal with the 5hit show he created.\n\nTell him to postpone the colleagues and neighbours and revert to the first plan. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Great! let him cancel. Problem Solved.", "NTA- let him cancel it. One less thing you have to worry about besides an unsupportive & inconsiderate BF", "NTA. Let him cancel the big get together he planned and expected you to do all the labor for. Or maybe go out to dinner someplace with the vacation friends while he entertains his guests.", "How is this even a question????? Wtf is wrong your bf? Was he raised in a barn? Is he helpless? And you specifically said don't invite people without asking and he did it multiple times anyway??\n\nNah F that and F him \n\nNTA but your bf is", "Right? \"You mean I don't get to cook for 15 people and their high maintenance kids? Oh what a punishment.\"", "Don't threaten me with a good time.", "This is perfect. Have him cancel everyone he invited, and you tell the couple you agreed to dinner is still on.", "This is what is referred to as a \"win-win\"", "I mean I wouldn\u2019t mind the cancellation that much but our friends already cleared their schedules for us and I wouldn\u2019t want to seem disrespectful", "NTA,, OP.\n\nVery good point. I would be pissed thinking it's a nice couples dinner with friends, then all of a sudden an entire daycare shows up.", "That's actually an excellent point. Even if it was all adults, if I was expecting a nice evening of dinner and conversation with ONE couple, and showed up to see half a dozen more people there, I think I'd go home and order takeout.", "Agree \ud83d\udcaf. Personally I wouldn\u2019t even come home that evening. \n\nAlso, OP tell the guest couple, they also think they are coming to a child free meal for four, not a party of 15 with 6 kids. \n\nNTA.", "I think he does realize that it\u2019s a lot of work but he doesn\u2019t care as long as he\u2019s not the one cooking and that\u2019s why he\u2019s upset I want him to cook", "Love this!!!", "He realizes it. He probably didn\u2019t like her setting boundaries after the first additional invites and is doing this to \u201cput her in her place\u201d.", "It's actually cooking for 15, since he also invited two coworkers and their spouses and kids - 4 more adults and two more children.", "Something, something, woman is my guess.", "No, not really. \nHe has a calendar so he writes everything down. He does sometimes asks me if it\u2019s really that day when he\u2019s not sure of himself but otherwise no. \n\nWe did but he argues that it\u2019s whoever agree to cook first that has to stick to it", "Or have the original couple meet her at the restaurant - without OP going home first.", "Sadly, he will say she didn't want to cook and forget the sort about adding more people without letting her know, not once but twice. \ud83d\ude12", "Oh no, that would be horrible. /s", "What?", "\"Oh no! Anyway...\"", "Thinking the same thing! \u201cOh no! I.am.

You and original company of 2 goes out to a nice restaurant while BF stews alone in anger at home. He is either really dense or really brave to try to a stunt like this. Its not even funny. Cooking for 15 people with out notice or preparation. No thanks.", "So? How is that YOUR problem. You're gonna set yourself on fire for him until you're just ash if you keep this up.", "You aren't the disrespectful one.\n\nEdit to add: \nIf he doesn't want to cxl, let him know you are perfectly willing to contact the neighbors and his coworker to let them know that your BF asked them w/o discussing w/ you first and that you would love to see them, but that on that day you won't have enough time to cook for all the extra invitees and that your boyfriend isn't willing to cook for them.\n\nYou are more than happy to schedule for another time when you can do something when you have more time to plan so you can manage the larger group and the different dietary accommodations.\n\n\nThen ask yourself why you are with a man who treats  you like this.", "That\u2019s fine. Personally I would tell the original friends there was a change in plan and meet them at a restaurant and catch up with them. Your bf can stay home cook, entertain and clean up after his guest. It\u2019s a win win.", "Does he normally treat you like this? You do know he\u2019s showing you that you don\u2019t get to tell him what to do after you asked him not to invite people to dinner without running it by you first? This is totally a power play on his part, he\u2019s telling you that he\u2019s the boss in your relationship and you\u2019ll do what he says. Don\u2019t let him disrespect you like this. I agree with the others saying you should take the original couple to a restaurant and leave him to deal with his guests alone. If he chooses to cancel then that\u2019s on him, you can still take the couple out for a meal, the rest isn\u2019t your problem. What you do about your relationship going forward is up to you, but remember you don\u2019t need to put up with his bs.\n\nETA obviously NTA but your partner is way out of line.", "Let him be the one to cancel, then. If he doesn't, don't do any of the cooking or food prep until you get back from work that day. \n\nHe made this mess, it's on him to clean it up.", "Cancel the home dinner and go out to eat with the friends who were the original people invited. Your boyfriend can stay home and cook for all the people he offered to host without consulting you.", "You can go with your friends out to dinner. Leave the incosiderate dude at home", "As someone else said maybe take your friends out to dinner that were originally invited? Let your husband deal with the rest.", "Maybe go out for dinner with the couple you actually invited & he can stay home & cook for all his invited guests\u2026 NTA", "The disrespect isn\u2019t on you. That\u2019s on your husband. He has the opportunity right now to fix his mistake (if you can call it that- who invites that many people without asking??) and he is actively choosing not to and being mad at you for not doing what he wants. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, your husband is.", "You're not the one being disrespectful.  your SO is.  Just make sure he doesn't throw you under the bus while he's making those uncomfortable calls/texts...  he sounds like the kind of guy that would do that.", "Go out with the one couple to a restaurant to spend time together.", "Tell your friends that  you found reservations at a restaurant that you thought they will like and go there and cancel the other 11.\n\nJeez, your husband sounds like my very Soth Asian family lol", "NTA.  Let him cancel, but tell the truth as why he's canceling.  This is on him, not on you.  You agreed to four people, he changed it, why should this fall on you?  You get to cook for all these people, and he does what?", "Maybe explain the situation to the original couple and ask them to join you at a restaurant? Then BF can either cook for the rest or cancel.\n\nIn any case, NTA. Even making the exact same thing, prepping ingredients for 15 will take 3 times as long as prepping the same ingredients for 4.\n\nPlus you now have to add a picky kids meal? No way.", "You were not disrespectful.  He was.", "Go to a restaurant with your friends you invited.\nNTA he can cook for the rest", ">I wouldn\u2019t want to seem disrespectful\n\nYou're kidding, right?  HE is disrespecting YOU and HIS friends.\n\nThe \"inviting more people after he agreed not to\" would be it for me.  I have an extremely low bullsh\\*t tolerance and this is a dumptruck of bullsh\\*t he is trying to unload on you. \n\nNTA but you are dating a MASSIVE one.", "Cancel the dinner and then just go out with the friends you originally invited WITHOUT your husband.", "Then let him live with the consequences of his own actions.", "He's using you.", "That\u2019s the point. That is an AH move. This gives he wants 1950s wifey vibes. If that\u2019s not the dynamic you want (sounds like you don\u2019t), tell him so. These little squabbles are the ones that actually help you evaluate what kind of relationship you have and what kind of relationship you want. \n\nSit him down, talk about this. Tell him that you do not wish to be the one doing all the hosting/cooking/mental load. That he can\u2019t make unilateral decisions in a partnership. That if that\u2019s what he wants, he needs to find someone else. If it\u2019s a dealbreaker for either one of you, better to find out now. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about canceling the party if you can\u2019t resolve this. I\u2019d rather not come to a dinner party that had underlying bad vibes. Been there, done that. As soon as alcohol flowed, it became a shitshow.", "Well that's even worse!", "I mean\u2026 yeah. He doesn\u2019t care because his plan all along was that you would do the work and he would reap the benefit. Is that a thing you feel good about in a relationship?", "Send everyone a group email and tell them that you are moving the dinner to your local Chinese. No need to consult your boyfriend about it.", "Why do you put up with this?", "... You realize that makes him a bad partner, right? Right?\n\nIf I were you, I'd make up a family emergency, go out with a friend, and treat myself to a nice restaurant while he deals with this mess.", "Then your boyfriend sucks. He can either cook or order out for the people he invited while he also has the afternoon free", "The fact that he doesn't care and is putting this on you is a real issue", "That all sounds like his problem and his issue. Why is he using you like this?", "Oooh good point!", "This is a total BS rule he pulled out of his ass.\n\nRelatedly, he is showing absolutely no respect for you or your original guests.", "So, unilaterally change the rule. He invites more people that's him agreeing to do the cooking. Play the same stupid game he is. Let him walk away.  You'll be better off.", "Yeah well, the issue is that you agreed to cook for four people, not 15. That's a whole different beast.\n\nIf I want, I can cook for four people in half an hour. For 15? I wouldn't be able to unless most of them don't mind food that's already mostly cold. At that point I'd just order in probably.", "You didn't agree to cook for that many people. When he changed the guest list, he changed the deal. He's twisting the rule to take advantage of you.", "He argues that because it allows him to invite a dozen people you didn\u2019t know about and not have to do the cooking. Tell him you agreed to cook for four people total and that is the amount of food you\u2019ll make. If he wants there to be good for anyone else, he either has to make it or order it. If that doesn\u2019t work for him, tell him to cancel. You can take the original two friends to dinner without your bf.", "Okay - that thinking is fair HOWEVER he changed the rules after the plan was set which then makes him a jerk and an unreasonable turd.  I posted elsewhere and if he won't relent - make a large salad and get takeout pizza and/subs?  Someone else mentioned burgers and hotdogs.  Use the KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) and never offer to cook for anyone outside of him again.", "You already explained this to him.  You agreed to cook for 4.  Tell him he can:\n\n1. Cook for everyone, or,\n2. Explain to the guests that he has to cancel because he did not discuss it with you. They will understand and explain to him that he is the AH here.", "So? Who cares what he says.", "Leave him with the other 11 guests he invited and take the vacation couple with you out to dinner. You are absolutely NTA here.", "Meh, why should OP have to go to all that trouble and deal with the extras herself?  OPs SO invited them, he needs to deal with the fallout.  Just my .2.", "This", "You agreed to cook for four people. The agreement to cook is null and void when he changes that number (drastically).", "That's the point. He's going to try to turn it around on her and that's not cool, because she may lose friends or be treated differently or negatively. You know how people can be \ud83d\ude29", "I like this!", "He should, but if he won\u2019t somebody\u2019s got to", "His cancellation will be: \"my girlfriend is being a pain and is making me cancel.\"   It will be OP's fault if he does it.", "Oh I know. I just wouldn't give a shit."]}
