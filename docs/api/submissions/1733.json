And when it snowed our neighbors would ask us if we want to come over and play with him. He fuckin LOVED it. They ended up building him a insulated dog house that he stayed in during the winter. Once it got to 40\u00b0f outside he never went back inside.

Oh hell no. She should have apologized at the grocery store but decided to up the ante. NTA and your husband should be on your side not his buddy the asshole-enabler.

As a dog lover with zero experience with huskies, I could see potentially making this mistake with a stranger, if I didn't feel it was safe to approach. But this woman was your neighbor AND had your phone number? Nah, she's a whiney asshole.", "NTA. I grew up with a huskies. Ours did the same. Our neighbor called animal welfare when he was lying on top of the insulated doghouse he refused to go inside. They laughed and told her to get stuffed, because it's a small northern town, and they knew what was up.  Especially if your husbands are friends, there is no reason for her to go that route instead of talking to you. If her feelings are hurt by you saying something about the person who called she should have just been upfront instead of trying to start drama.", "This is the problem with blanketed pet laws.

If you can you should always ask.\n I stopped", "NTA. She was ignorant about the situation and trying to do the right thing in her mind. She should\u2019ve eaten crow and apologized once she realized she was in the wrong but you had every right to be pissed.
