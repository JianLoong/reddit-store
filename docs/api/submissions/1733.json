I only ever had to reduce the greyhound's food for a couple of weeks, and we had to monitor her weight after she had a hind leg amputated, but the dobermann was soooo overweight. I had him on such a strict diet but my mother fed him while I was out. \n\nIn the end, after a routine vet visit, I decided to lay it on thick and told her they'd said he'd be dead within 6 months if he didn't lose weight. He wasn't that fat but it did the trick. We got him back down to a nice healthy weight and I only had to remind her once more about a year later.\n\nFat pets just break my heart.

But you, NTA", "My husky mix comes in better now that she is an old girl, but most of her life when the cold and/or snow came, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get her back in for hours on end.  Literally every winter I wondered if I would ever get that knock on the door.  NTA.  Nicely done calling her that without calling her that.", "I knew op was a true and good husky owner when she called them \"the two dipshits\" lol", "Exactly hahahah NTA", "NTa. THIS. Neighbor thought of herself as the heroic dog savior, but instead she proved herself to be a clueless, nosy, asshole. And entitled also for demanding an apology for OP calling her an asshole (which she did, but only indirectly). lol", "Yuuup, and also if she's such a kind and caring neighbor, why did she call the cops on you rather than communicate with you, and then come up to you in the grocery store trying to find out what kind of trouble she got you into?\n\nWhy the hell is your husband on her side?", "This, and she especially shouldn't play a game of having her husband be a messenger, when her husband doesn't have her back", "Yuuuup, she really just wanted to see that she made you sweat. What an asshole. \n\nI think you should question why she has such a fucking issue with you, and yeah I know I've already messaged this to you, but you should question why your husband is on her side when she is harassing you and now bismirching your good name", "My parents had an American Eskimo - small dog, but not like, a toy dog - and when it snowed she was in heaven. We got something like 16\u201d one year, and she started hop-running over someone\u2019s tracks in the yard, because she was too short to just run! she eventually ended up digging a short tunnel through the snow beside the little path\u2026I have a video of her being ridiculously excited, hopping through the tracks on the path and then turning and running through her tunnel to skip some of the path, running towards the house, jumping and turning in circles, then going again. I hope that description makes sense, lol. She was a great doggo.", "Omg! My first dog when I was a kid was the same mix. \n\nPound pup definitely had features of both. She was a very sweet girl.", "Reminds me of my childhood dog. She was a german shepherd that loved watching cars. She taught herself how to unlock the front door and open it so that she could let herself out. But thankfully she never want far because she was also notoriously lazy, lol. So she would just walk to the end of the driveway and lay down in the grass to watch the cars passing by. Then when she had enough she'd walk right back inside. Thankfully the neighbors all knew her and loved her, so it never caused any problems. Eventually she outgrew the behavior when she got older and became even more lazy, and was content to just watch the cars from her bed by the window. Some dogs just have funny quirks and like odd stuff.", "I googled and got:\n\n\"Siberian Huskies can handle temperatures as cold as -75 degrees Fahrenheit (-60 degrees Celsius). The unique coat of the Husky enables this breed to live in both cold and warm climates\"", "My pomchi is currently pitching fits because I won't let him go out for the tenth time today to play in the snow that's half his height.\n\nI swear I'll never keep this little shit from doing himself in.", "Insemination? We have a husky/pomeranian cross, the husky is the mother, and were told that it was an artificial insemination. Our little princess sniffs the air when I open the back door for her in the morning, and if it is raining refuses to go out unless she really needs to. I keep telling her she is a half husky and is not supposed to be afraid of little rain, she licks me in response", "Sounds just like my boy Argo \ud83d\ude02 he was a rescue we raised from 3 weeks on, sooooooo sassy and mouthy. He\u2019s smart and knows commands, but you can see him decide if he wants go actually listen or not!", "Grew up with a Shepard/husky mix as well, the only time he wanted in the house is if the entire family was in the house or there was a thunderstorm. And boy howdy if there was a thunder storm, he would get so scared that he would bolt up the stairs to the bedrooms. For context it was a spiral staircase made by the previous owners out of scrap metal, steep AF because the spot wasn\u2019t actually big enough for a spiral staircase, this dog could not get up or down them in any other circumstances. \n\nSo many memories of my stepdad cursing at/coaxing the dog back down the stairs, followed by praise and love when 30minutes later he\u2019d accomplished getting the dog back to the ground level. \n\nHe was such a good puppy.", "I have a shepherd/husky mix and he will bake outside in 40C weather until I force him to come inside so my neighbours don\u2019t call animal control \ud83d\ude02 he loves the heat and the cold.", "Pur part dalmatian hates rain and snow. We have to put booties and a coat on her in the winter.", "We tried to convince her she could just jump back in as we were in the apartment in the center of the building. (I do laugh about it a bit, now.)", "My current German Shepherd is the biggest baby during thunderstorms, it\u2019s a guessing game of where he\u2019ll be. Under the bed? In the tub? In my lap? Those are his top choices. He\u2019s 112 pounds, I greatly prefer he not choose my lap lol", "Holy shit you're not wrong. Like, at all. Bork is part bull terrier and staffy.", "\u2026 by their throats", "Just be ready for the shedding! My brother said my mom's house was the only place he knew that he could walk in with a sweater and walk out with a fur coat.", "Kind of sounds like their fur is the canine equivalent of duck feathers. Water resistant on the outside with natural oil, but soft and insulating on the inside. Which I suppose makes sense since ducks evolved to be water birds, and Chesapeake bay retrievers were developed by breeders to be water dogs. I just think that the overlap in similar features in totally different species is cool.", "This is why I tell my friends they need to set up a grooming visits account and start acclimating them asap if they want a husky (or any double-coated dog). You basically *need* to have them professionally groomed to get alllll the undercoat out or it never ends."]}
