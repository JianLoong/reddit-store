This situation also happened 2 weeks ago. Sorry for the long post in advance!  \n\n\nBackground: So I ( 21 F) decided way back in December that for my 22nd bday(July) I wanted to have a family trip with my immediate family (siblings & parents) and one of my really close cousins. I planned for us to go to destin florida & where we are staying costs us $4000 in total for the week. That did not include the gas for us to drive, restaurant costs, events, shopping, etc, it only is for the condo.\n\n\nSo on to the story:  my cousin agreed to all the plans and everyone was on board to go and made sure their schedules were aligned with the trip. Apparently, my cousin had got a gf last November but told no one about her until April of this year. 2 weeks ago, after the trip is planned and set, my cousin asked if his FIANC\u00c9 could come with us!? First I asked when did he even get a fianc\u00e9 because he only told us in April that he had a gf? He said it was a spontaneous thing and they got engaged the beginning of June but wanted to enjoy the engagement for a while before telling everyone. It honestly didn\u2019t make sense to me but I eventually told him no. \n\n\nHe asked me why & I said 1. This is my birthday trip 2. I only wanted my family to go 3. I do not know her and we\u2019ve never met before & 4. If that was the case then my brothers gf who\u2019s he\u2019s been dating for 2 months would come . He told me he understood but he just had to ask because she wanted to go and I said no problem. \n\n\nThe next day I get some texts from her off of his phone basically saying that I am an ugly petty b*tch for saying no, she is his fianc\u00e9 and should be invited to everything he\u2019s invited to, I have no respect for their relationship,  that she will make sure he doesn\u2019t get to go, and some other things. So I screenshot the messages and sent it to my family gc that just has my parents and siblings in it. Then I texted her back and said she was an irrelevant girl that no one in our family knew about and that she should take it up with him bc he\u2019s known of the trip since December and hasn\u2019t mentioned it to her up until now.\n\n I didn\u2019t get a text back but later he called me and apologized for what she said but was irritated that I engaged and made her so mad. I apologized too because I really should not have said those things but I didn\u2019t like how she expected to be added to the trip last minute when everything was booked and especially since I do not know her & it is my birthday trip. He said he knows and agrees but I should not have argued back but just waited later to call him and I told him he was right. \n\n\nI told him I would understand if he didn\u2019t want to go to have peace in his relationship and make his fianc\u00e9 happy but he said he is still going. He\u2019s told me his fianc\u00e9 is still mad about it. \n\n\nAITA for what I said and do you think it\u2019s not fair for her to not go?", "created_utc": 1688420017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pvlck/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_fianc\u00e9_off_not/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin's fianc\u00e9e was completely out of line. She sounds like an entitled and spoiled brat. You need to tell your cousin plainly that if his fianc\u00e9e doesn't respect you or another member of your family, you will not tolerate it. . Why did you apologize in the first place?", "I think the family should tell your cousin to run and run fast.\n\nNTA.\n\nI would have had some choice words also.", "NTA.  The girl immediately confirmed she is giant bag of drama that OP was better off not inviting.  Even before that, plans and arrangements were in place.  If she was that important, it was on the cousin to say something sooner to get her introduced/invited.  Her texting via cousin's phone was tacky AF.\n\nInfo: When is due date?  I'd wager a virtual beverage she's pregnant and feels like she hit the lottery with the baby.  Keep an eye on her.", "NTA Can you imagine putting up with that extreme entitlement for a week? Hell no, she can't go!", "NTA. At least you learned what this girl is like before you have to spend time with her.", "The only thing you did wrong here was to apologize when no apology was due.\n\nYour poor cousin!  Marrying this woman when he actually knows who she is.  What is he thinking?  \n\nThat screen-shot he must have seen -- he might just as well have received a red flag big enough to engulf his whole house.\n\nNTA", "NTA but here's another angle, is she possibly trying to isolate him from your family? The swiftness of their engagement and how she acts kinda makes me think she might be trying to burn his bridges.", "NTA\n\nFrankly his GF/fiance or whatever the hell she is today sounds unhinged to expect to be invited when she's never met a single member of the family, and then when she isn't she goes nuclear on a complete stranger", "Here's my 2 cents: it sounds like your relationship with your cousin is pretty important to you. He's got this maybe-crazy-maybe-just-insecure fianc\u00e9. She should not be going on your trip. It's booked and paid for, she's not on that list. You know that you were wrong with some things that you said, and you should be willing to apologize for that. She should also be willing to apologize for what she said as well. Hopefully your cousin can get her to understand why she isn't invited on his cousin's birthday trip. \n\nHowever, when you have the opportunity you need to make some peace with her. It's not about being friends with her, it's about finding the ability to maintain peace so that you don't hurt the relationship that you have with your cousin. Who knows if their relationship is the real deal, going to last a while, or just going to fall apart. But regardless, you need to make sure that your cousin doesn't get ripped apart from the family due to disagreements with this woman. \n\nIn my experience, kill 'em with kindness is the best approach. Be friendly, cordial, but continue to stand your ground where it is important to you. Keep your relationship with your cousin in mind and be civil with his fianc\u00e9.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I did ask him if I could apologize to her personally bc I really do feel bad for calling her irrelevant but she said she didn\u2019t want to talk to me.", "Thank you! I really feel bad bc after I sent it to my family gc, they all went OFF on my cousin ab her. They told him if she stepped out of line again she would regret the day she said yes to him, etc.  We have a habit of going off and being quick at the mouth when someone disrespects anyone in our family. We\u2019re all very protective of one another. Even tho she said those things, me sending that made the situation worst. I should have handled it on my own.", "That was kind of my point.. like I understand she is now your fianc\u00e9 but why is she only knowing ab the trip now if she was so important for you to propose to!? Their whole situation feels rushed and weird to me.", "He has a tendency to date very entitled women who have no friends. This is why I think he took so long to introduce her to the family bc we all are always honest ab how we feel about his gfs. He gets very annoyed and says we are too harsh, judgmental, and sometimes jealous! I genuinely think she is trying to separate him from us bc of how quick everything is happening but she is going to have a rude awakening if she does anything else. I am trying to keep the peace but some of my cousins plus my siblings STILL want to cuss her out but I\u2019ve held them off.", "\u201c or whatever she is today\u201d \ud83d\ude2dI had to go back and change gf to fianc\u00e9 twice before posting bc i still forget lol.", "You are right and I agree with everything you said. I did apologize to him and asked him if I could apologize to her face to face but she declined. He\u2019s truly like another brother to me which is why I was so apologetic but I still told him what she did was very disrespectful and he should understand why my family was so irritated. He told me he understood and he talked to her ab why she was wrong. I also told my family that it is done with and either way, we\u2019re not here to be liked by her but since she\u2019s in our cousins life we HAVE to think ab him before we do anything when it comes to her. \n\nThey were really annoyed bc of his history of dating entitled women and are just tired of how he lets them kind of do whatever. \n\nSometimes he doesn\u2019t communicate things well so I doubt he told her it\u2019s my bday trip and not just a regular family trip that I organized. So I will ask him if she understands why she\u2019s not invited to the trip \n\nThanks for your input, I really appreciate the advice!", "I would not apologize to that lady.. You didn't say anything that was really rude or offensive, what she said was so out of left field and had zero respect. I applaud you for being so kind about the situation, but people like that are just plain toxic.", "That's thoughtful of you to try, and perhaps once a bit of time passes and some emotion has dissipated she will change her mind. \n\nHer comments to you were uncalled for, rude and immature. It was stupid of her to do that as her introduction to you, so please know you are being kind by wanting to try when she was immature from the go. \n\nYeesh, those 2 communicate so poorly they are going to have some big relationship issues!", "Your family was right to blast your cousin. His fianc\u00e9e had no right to behave so badly. In fact, I think that sharing her inappropriate texts with your family has shown her true colors on what kind of a person she is. You sound like you have a really awesome family, because you all care about one another. OP, how old is your cousin and his fianc\u00e9e? And how old are you?", "Glad I wasn't entirely shooting in the dark there. With that in mind, make sure to keep contact with your cousin. No matter how hard she tries to scare everyone off, stand your ground and be there for him.", "I mean 7 months of not meeting her and 6 months and supposedly they're engaged honestly seems pretty weird. It almost makes you wonder if, with the damn near shotgun engagement and her being quick to anger, she isn't knocked up", "Thanks so much", "I\u2019m 21 and they are both 23.", "Thank you, I will. Him and I are so close that he tells people I\u2019m his sister.
