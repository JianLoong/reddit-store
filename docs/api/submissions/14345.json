Think tall and thin with one or two (small) rooms on each floor.\n\nAfter buying the house, they didn't move in for a while but had builders doing a fair amount of remodelling and redesign. We didn't think too much of this until they moved in and it became clear that they had changed up how the rooms in the house are used. The room next to our bedroom on the top floor has become a man cave/gaming room for the husband and they then having a living room below and the bedrooms below that.\n\nI cannot fully explain the amount of noise that this man makes while gaming, some of the noises I am not entirely sure it is possible for a man to make. He screams, shouts, cries, wails, bangs and everything else between the hours of 10pm and 2/3am most nights. After the first night I went round and spoke to both of them with a recording of what we heard. He wouldn't apologise and his wife said she just \"sleeps with a white noise machine and it doesn't bother her\" and therefore this nightmare has continued for the last 2/3months. We've spoken to them upwards of 15 times and they just don't care.\n\nRecently, after being woken up, I went downstairs in our house to get my headphones and drown out the noise. I knocked something over next to the adjoining wall, making a loud-ish bang, and then heard a baby crying through the wall. I'm not entirely sure what happened but when I went back upstairs a minute later the shouting had completely stopped. The next night when he started shouting again, I went back downstairs and banged on the wall and the baby cried again, then the shouting stopped again.\n\nMy wife bumped into the neighbour wife a couple of days ago and she mentioned that their baby kept crying during the night so her husband was having to stop gaming/making noise. I took this as a sign to continue doing it and its meant I am getting full nights sleep for the first time in months. At the first shout, I go and knock on the wall until I hear a cry and then go back to bed. \n\nIt's working an absolute treat but my wife says sleep patterns are very important to babies and this could be bad for them.
