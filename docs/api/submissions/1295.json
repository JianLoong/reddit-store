You are wrong to lie and sneak and your mom is correct that your brother is also an AH for sneaking and taking you away from school activities. I can understand why you want to see your brother but unfortunately you are a minor and you are not entitled to do it without your mom\u2019s permission. This is one of the lousy parts of living with divorce.", "I have two answers.\n\nI\u2019m gonna give you a gentle YTA for lying to your mom. I understand that you wanted to see your brother and that was always going to be against your mom\u2019s wishes, from what I understand. I can\u2019t blame your mom for being upset at this situation. \n\nHowever, you are *not* an asshole for wanting to see your brother. Your mom doesn\u2019t have any right to tell you that you\u2019re not allowed to see your sibling. That\u2019s not fair, even a little bit. Expecting you to wait until you\u2019re 18 to see your brother is insane and very controlling.", "nta what is your moms problem?

She doesn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for you. She wants what is best for her. She\u2019s willing to destroy your bonds to stick it to your father. She\u2019s being small and petty.\n\nKeep this in mind whenever she tries to guilt you, punish you or say that she\u2019s doing the best for you.\n\nTry to get your dad to fight for custody again.", "You\u2019re not the AH sweetie- but you have to work this out with your mom. Do you have an aunt , grandma or family friend who could help you talk to her about this. I think you should be able to talk to your brother.", "INFO:  What was the reason the Court let your mom remove you from your dad's house?  Because they don't do that without a serious reason.\n\nETA:  I don't think you are an ahole for wanting to spend time some innocent time with your brother.  He's your family too.  Maybe you can try to talk to your mom again.  Tell her that it is important to you to be able to see your brother.  Ask her how you can spend time together that she would approve.  And if she says never, then I would just tell her flat out that you will never forgive her for that.\n\nNTA", "INFO - How old are you?", "Unfortunately, ESH.\n\nThat suck is not evenly distributed, though. You really shouldn't be lying and sneaking out of the house. Those are bad moves and will reflect badly on you with your mom. She's right that it's irresponsible, and it will erode her future trust in you very badly. Please don't.\n\nBut! Your mom also sucks here, for cutting you off from your brother. That's a bad parenting move on her part and I'm not surprised it's blowing up on her like this.", "No, my brother is older. He was already there when they got married.", "He dropped out of school and works a minimum wage job.", "My mom's family all agree with her that my brother is no good.", "He was always late for pickup/dropoff and kept letting her know last minute that he needed to move dates around because of work or personal stuff.

No offense man, but at that age I\u2019m not sure you have enough context for us to fully understand the dynamics at play here.\n\nI understand how it feels through your eyes, and I\u2019m completely empathetic to that. But it\u2019s possible that this situation may be more complicated than that.\n\nI have divorced parents and half siblings too. It\u2019s really, really tough. Growing up there was always so much animosity and so many grudges that I didn\u2019t even care about. I just wanted a part of in family - my *whole* family* - and it felt like I was constantly being pulled in directs I didn\u2019t want to go. I totally understand the types of things you\u2019re dealing with.\n\nAnd you might be completely right about this for all I know. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable saying who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong without knowing the full picture.", "Would a teacher do that?
