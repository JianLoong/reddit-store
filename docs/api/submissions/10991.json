This is bothering me because I know that she isn\u2019t allergic and seafood won\u2019t make her sick or anything, she just \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it\u201d. I\u2019ve seen her eat it before but that is a very rare occurrence. This has been ok in her family growing up which is foreign to me. Her father doesn\u2019t like seafood, and to accommodate him on Christmas, her grandfather makes her dad steak while the rest of the family eats seafood. \nFor me and my family, if you \u201cdidn\u2019t like something\u201d it more so meant that you wouldn\u2019t order it if you went out to eat, but you\u2019d still eat it if someone served it to you. For her and her family it means that you never ever have to eat anything that you don\u2019t thoroughly enjoy eating. \n\nAITA for thinking that she is being childish?\n\nEdit: the seafood I\u2019m making isn\u2019t like a filet of flounder or shellfish or something like that. I\u2019m making crawfish etouffee which is a dish with a lot of ingredients mixed together. You wouldn\u2019t know there was seafood in it by looking at it or if you were eating it for the first time\n\nEdit 2: This has been eye opening for me. Thank you for all of you that have replied.

Some people just don't like some things. I have people that I've cooked for that hate mushrooms. Not an allergy. They can eat them minced in a sauce, but they dislike the texture of them whole or sliced, so I don't use them when I cooked for them. Dude, you know your gf doesn't like seafood. She just doesn't. So either don't make things with seafood, or expect her to find her own alternative. It's not even like she demanded you make her something new. She did her own thing. You're insulted she doesn't want to eat your cooking. She won't like it. Your \"it's not like she'd know\" doesn't magically remove seafood. \n\nIf someone doesn't like a thing, they shouldn't have to be allergic for someone to take that seriously.

So who is the childish one?", "YTA- why the heck should she have to eat something she doesn't like?  And crawfish no thanks. Seafood isn't for everyone- myself included.

And then to find out its crawfish etouffee....I mean even die hard seafood eaters sometime have a hard time with that one.", "YTA - I absolutely HATE seafood--the taste, the smell, I just do.

Are you serious?", "YTA. I have a literal word document which is just a table of members of my family and which foods they won't eat and sometimes it's exhausting trying to make sure everyone enjoys when I cook and if I want to cook some things I have to wait for specific combinations of people but if I am cooking for people I feel a responsibility to provide them with a meal they will enjoy. If she doesn't like seafood she doesn't like seafood and forcing her to eat it will just make her dislike it more.", "Obviously it can\u2019t be a universal thing, but most women I know dislike seafood.

You could have made it for yourself at any point that you wanted because you can in fact eat something without her. \n\nMy partner isn't big on seafood. You know what happens when I want seafood and he doesn't? I make him a separate main and go about my day. No fuss.

You picked something you KNEW she wouldn\u2019t like and have the audacity to say she\u2019s the one being childish.

If she says she doesn't like it, you need to accept it and shut up.", "First of all crawfish etouffee is visibly seafood...idk how you're making it.

I\u2019m someone who loves food and cooking, my whole family does! And my husband and his family just\u2026 don\u2019t. He often says that if there was a pill he could take to get all his daily required nutrients he would take it. They all eat very practically and plainly. And as someone who just genuinely loves food it does get me down. Seafood is a big one for me too, I grew up eating it, and my husband won\u2019t touch it (no allergies etc.) \n\nHowever, if you do just enjoy cooking, instead of trying to force your GF to eat something you know she won\u2019t like, try to find out what she does like and absolutely BLOW HER MIND with an awesome meal made up of foods she does like :) that is one massive bonus ive found with husband and in laws fam. It really doesn\u2019t take much effort from me to make something that they all think is amazing and the best food they\u2019ve ever eaten. I just have to stick within their safe food. \n\nI should point out too, that dietary related anxieties are more common than you might think. My husbands issues definitely come from a bit of body insecurity from having been over weight when he was younger.

In the future, before cooking, tell her what you want to make until you know and understand your food preferences better. And she should do the same for you.", "Obviously at this point you know YTA. I feel your frustration, truly; nothing has quite the same sting as making a nice meal for someone you love and they scorn it.\n\nBut hey, more for you. Leftovers to take to work, and such.

You make a seafood dish. You get mad she won\u2019t eat it.\nYTA", "YTA- One of the best things about being an adult is you can do as you like. If you don't want to stay out at night, you can go home.  If you don't like bowling, you don't have to. If you don't like the taste of fish, you don't have to eat it. It sounds like she set a boundary you didn't like, so you are trying to force her. Rude.", "YTA\nShe gets to like what she likes.  Skipping seafood is not the most unusual food choice.

The fuck are you thinking, dude?? Unless you live in parts of the world with ready access to crawfish and are exposed to them and to foods with them in it all the time, crawfish is very much for many people an exotic, intimidating, and particularly gross crustacean.

My partner thinks I don't have a very sophisticated palate, and he's 100% correct, but he constantly calls me obstinate for not eating seafood because it's healthy. I have a very healthy diet and my doctors have never suggested I eat seafood to enhance my health.   And just a piece of advice since you already sound like an AH... if you ever try to sneak shit into her food, that broken trust will ripple into all aspects of your relationship.

I know some people don\u2019t like the flaky-ness of a filet of fish or the mental hurdle of eating a bite of 100% seafood. I thought since it was mixed together with other things it might make a difference. Clearly I was wrong", "I resent that accusation actually. I have apologized to her and stated that I was wrong.", "Both of my parents will 100% think everybody in this thread is crazy and raised by bad parents. I think that is the problem. They have very old and dated values", "Bravo to you for taking people's (rather harshly worded) advice and recognizing that what you're requesting your gf to do is not a normal request.  People often don't realize things that were \"normal\" in their family are outside of the societal norms until they come in conflict with someone about it later in life.  Just take this a learning moment, apologize to your gf, and move on.", "Is she the only person in your entire life that you can get seafood with? Why can\u2019t you go with a friend? Or, it\u2019s totally fine of you to cook a meal for yourself that she doesn\u2019t like - sometimes my husband choose to eat different meals so we can have something the other doesn\u2019t like. She solved the problem with 0 issue by eating nuggets.", "Going to a seafood restaurant seems like something there should be a compromise on.  Most seafood restaurants do have other things.  My husband doesn't like seafood but occasionally we will go and he'll get chicken or pasta.", "Seafood is seafood. Very disrespectful", "So next time you're going to believe her and not need a bunch of strangers to tell you you're wrong right?", "They sound like AHs to be honest.", "So YTA and so is your family.", "Just because that\u2019s what you were taught doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s one thing to try something you\u2019re not a fan of when you go over someone\u2019s house and they have NO clue that you don\u2019t like it. To be polite, some people will eat some bites or all of a meal anyway even if they hate it. And some won\u2019t and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nBUT those people aren\u2019t romantic partners that KNOW that their partner doesn\u2019t like the food. That\u2019s a completely different situation. \n\nWhy would you knowingly make something that you know she doesn\u2019t like? That\u2019s so unbelievably rude. And to top it all off, you\u2019re mad that she won\u2019t eat it anyway!"]}
