{"id": 10991, "submission_id": "11ct6ej", "title": "AITA for being ticked off my gf won\u2019t eat seafood?", "selftext": "I am making a nice Sunday dinner tonight that has seafood in it and my gf has informed me that she won\u2019t be eating it because it has seafood in it and that instead she will be having chicken nuggets from the freezer. This is bothering me because I know that she isn\u2019t allergic and seafood won\u2019t make her sick or anything, she just \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it\u201d. I\u2019ve seen her eat it before but that is a very rare occurrence. This has been ok in her family growing up which is foreign to me. Her father doesn\u2019t like seafood, and to accommodate him on Christmas, her grandfather makes her dad steak while the rest of the family eats seafood. \nFor me and my family, if you \u201cdidn\u2019t like something\u201d it more so meant that you wouldn\u2019t order it if you went out to eat, but you\u2019d still eat it if someone served it to you. For her and her family it means that you never ever have to eat anything that you don\u2019t thoroughly enjoy eating. \n\nAITA for thinking that she is being childish?\n\nEdit: the seafood I\u2019m making isn\u2019t like a filet of flounder or shellfish or something like that. I\u2019m making crawfish etouffee which is a dish with a lot of ingredients mixed together. You wouldn\u2019t know there was seafood in it by looking at it or if you were eating it for the first time\n\nEdit 2: This has been eye opening for me. Thank you for all of you that have replied. I AM THE ASSHOLE. I have since apologized and will change the way I view this topic going forward.\n\nEdit 3: just wanted to summarize a lot of my replies in one place. I told her that I wanted to make this for Sunday dinner earlier in the week. We haven\u2019t had seafood for dinner in the few years we\u2019ve lived together and we do not go out to seafood restaurants, so yes, I made this selfishly for myself. I was hoping that she would eat it/try it but that was something I shouldn\u2019t have done. I\u2019d also like to share that we are not arguing about this. I brought my feelings to this subreddit to see if I was being an asshole and I was. I\u2019m not throwing crawfish across the room in a seafood fueled rage because she won\u2019t eat my etouffee. We talked about it and we are ok.\n\nEdit 4: for a post where hundreds of people are calling me an asshole, this has been a pretty therapeutic experience to get feedback/constructive criticism from so many people. If I had one wish for this sub, it would be that we all tried to comment level-headed things so OP/asshole will take the constructive criticism instead of getting defensive. For the most part all comments here have been respectful and level-headed, but there have been a few that were particularly harsh that I could imagine would make AH\u2019s dig their heels in with their opinion. I\u2019m not asking for y\u2019all to be nicer to me lol just an observation for the future. Again, thank you to all that have read and given me your opinion. I AM THE ASSHOLE\n\nEdit 5: for those of you still reading - I think a MAJOR disconnect with this whole thing is that there isn\u2019t a food that I\u2019d refuse to eat. I eat everything. There are just different levels of how much I like food: \n1)love it,\n2)every now and then, \n3)last resort (but still like!)\n\nSo when someone used to tell me that they don\u2019t like a food, in my mind it just meant that they\u2019d prefer to eat something higher on the \u201clike\u201d scale. I never knew there were such strong *negative* opinions towards food. Things like getting nauseous just thinking about a certain type of food was never even something I considered as a possibility.", "created_utc": 1677446692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ct6ej/aita_for_being_ticked_off_my_gf_wont_eat_seafood/", "score": 3099, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So either don't make things with seafood, or expect her to find her own alternative. It's not even like she demanded you make her something new. She did her own thing. You're insulted she doesn't want to eat your cooking. She won't like it. Your \"it's not like she'd know\" doesn't magically remove seafood. \n\nIf someone doesn't like a thing, they shouldn't have to be allergic for someone to take that seriously.

And as someone who just genuinely loves food it does get me down.

It really doesn\u2019t take much effort from me to make something that they all think is amazing and the best food they\u2019ve ever eaten. I just have to stick within their safe food. \n\nI should point out too, that dietary related anxieties are more common than you might think. My husbands issues definitely come from a bit of body insecurity from having been over weight when he was younger.

The fuck are you thinking, dude?? Unless you live in parts of the world with ready access to crawfish and are exposed to them and to foods with them in it all the time, crawfish is very much for many people an exotic, intimidating, and particularly gross crustacean.

That's kind of like trying to trick her in a way. If she doesn't like or worse gets grossed out by the thought of seafood and especially by crustaceans, like many people do, I feel like if she were to eat it and then, if she wasn't familiar with crawfish, find out what they were, that could be an especially distressing experience for her.\n\nAlso, why are you trying to push your theoretically very delicious meal on somebody who won't even be able to properly appreciate it?

She solely wanted to exercise power over me by making me eat something that disgusted me.\n\nOur relationship ended when I tried to kick her out of my apartment and she stabbed me with a kitchen knife. Moral of the story? People who do wild and wacky shit like my ex and OP do it for a reason.", "You\u2019re not the only person to mention the mustard guy. I can assure you that this situation is nothing like that one (thankfully). Please read my edits", "Nobody is dieing on any hills today", "And it smells so fishy! Tastes so fishy!", "i agree, its really quite shrimple. whether or not he was conchscious of his girlfriends feelings towards seafood beforehand, his tunacity in trying to force it on her must be quite grueeling for her. its a fluke they managed to work together for this long without floundering", "My niece was in her twenties when she found out apples weren't supposed to be spicy. \n\nUnfortunately, in my 30s i found that strawberries and kiwis both began to taste like burning. I used to love chocolate covered strawberries.", "Same, the amount of people who get so upset over this baffles me.", "I think it's because the smell of fish is just so overwhelmingly...thick? I don't know how to describe it. Other smells don't seem so inescapable like fish is. Most other smells, good or bad, are like \"here is a smell, but also air so it feels like you can breathe\" whereas fish is like \"fishfishfishfishfish\"", "There are dishes that I would rather be hit hard in the face than eat. I would prefer a decent amount of pain to the taste of some things. People who don\u2019t really dislike any food usually find this surprising.", "Yo yo yo yo yo, he might be a BLIND asshole lol.", "I don\u2019t know where in Louisiana you\u2019ve been, but I guarantee no one from BR, Lafayette, or NO call them crawdads", "I am not autistic but I have sensory issues, and seafood is one of the things that makes me gag. I also can't tolerate a lot of fruit textures. I can eat a wide variety of things generally, but seafood in particular will send me right over the edge. I have to hold my breath to go past the fish counter at the local market it's so bad.", "I think it's some sort of generic defect that makes my brain interpret the smell of seafood as \"yuck, dude, spoiled, run away!\"  My father was the same way.  It's not just a bad smell but a get away smell.  Those who have it know it and those who don't can't understand.  (Weird fact, I have trouble telling if milk is spoiled by smell.  No idea if this is related to the fish thing.)", "I had noorovirus hit me when I was 4, the first bout of BAD vomiting was mac n' cheese. I am 40 now and still cannot eat macaroni and cheese, no matter how it is prepared. I just can't.  My family was stand in government food lines, eat what's in front of you or fall asleep in it level poor and that was the food they never even put in front of me or tried to force me to eat. Vomiting every time I tried it wasn't worth it to me or my parents.", "This. All it takes is *one* time getting sick, and you might never be able to eat that food again. Because sometimes your brain immediately tags it as a \"Danger\" food. Because it made you sick, so clearly you shouldn't be eating it.", "When I was 5, I ate pancakes while I had the flu.  Never again did I eat cake from a frying pan \ud83d\ude2d", "I didn't say it was. I'm saying that by the way it's made, one would think the texture would be similar to a custard or firm cream pie. It, however, has a weird mouth feel that overpowers the taste for me. The closest I can come to describing is the texture of a custard not tempered correctly, so the eggs scramble.", "I have dealt with a kid that will not eat shells and cheese because he got sick on it once from his momma. He would eat anything but pasta shells and cheese regardless if the sauce was from scratch. Store bought macaroni and cheese was okay but for the love of god, I could not get this child to eat pasta shaped in a different form.  \n\nI am a stepmom and every time my stepdaughter gets sick, yet another food is eliminated from the meal plan every time she is over. Hotdogs and chicken are now off the menu when she is over. Her mom cooks with chicken a lot and she cannot stand it anymore unless I introduce a new recipe. Her mom loves pizza, guess what? Now I have to make sure when she is here to rarely have pizza because my stepkid has it multiple times in a week. \n\nEvery time my stepkid gets sick, she cannot stomach the meals that she remembers being sick on. so I plan meals around her aversions. Sucks ass every time a new food is eliminated. The latest thing is mozzarella cheese sticks.", "Is their a chance she has food allergies? Seems like a lot of getting sick, even for a kid. Most of those things seem to include dairy, has that been looked into.", "Sooooo much this, I am so tired of people trying to convince me on the notion of seafood. Like, I live in a good place to experience seafood, it's not for a lack of options, guys. People do it to me with beer, too. There's not going to be a version of beer that doesn't make me gag from the bitterness, I can't help that my taste buds have bitter sensitivity turned up to 11. \n\nI will not join in with the type of people that say \"have you tried X\" because I empathize. But to share an unexpected experience of mine, and hopefully it doesn't seem like I'm invalidating you: the ONE time that I enjoyed a meal with fish in it was when I was in Hawaii last year and I had absurdly fresh and very good quality tuna poke. I was willing to give it a shot because Hawaii seems like a good place to try, and my SO said he'd eat it for me if I hated it. Raw fish feels like the absolute least likely option for me to enjoy, so I was definitely expecting to take a single bite and push it his direction. But I gotta say, tuna is...well, I'd probably eat it again someday. It was surprisingly \"land meat-y.\" But I'll keep that to myself so I don't encourage the pesterers lol"]}
