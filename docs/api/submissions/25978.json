Generally, things have been rocky. Rocky because he is unemployed, lives with his parents, and has a history of defensiveness that can make him uncomfortable to be around (this is related to his non-employment). I have a lot of empathy for him, because he recently went through a life altering illness, and because, at the core of it, I think he does have a good heart.\n\nBut recently my empathy ran out. \n\nHe often stays at my house for days at a time and enjoys my cooking. I made a from scratch lasagna, all the way down to pulling the tomatoes out of the garden. We had a spoken agreement that he would tidy up after. After I ate, I went upstairs, and had a bath and fell asleep in bed. \n\nSide note, I work in epidemiology and often talk about food safety as something I'm very meticulous about because I see the stats. \n\nI woke up the next morning after the lasagna and went to the kitchen to see it out on the counter, left out all night, spoiled. I winced, and before dealing with it, went to take my dog out and run her around before breakfast. When I got back in, he had woken up, clearly saw that he left the lasagna out and put it in the fridge. I discovered this when I went back to the kitchen to get a glass of water. He was willing to risk getting me sick and save face by putting it in the fridge after it sat out 14 hours. If I didn't know any better, I would have potentially eaten it. \n\nKnowing he's a bit fragile, I tried to talk to him about it. I didn't expect him to respond the way he did. When I asked him if he knew that eating food left out is unsafe he said he didn't. After 2 years together and me setting boundaries around food safety, that didn't make sense to me. So I paused and looked at him confused. He screamed as loud as he could an inch from my face \"I DIDN'T KNOW, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M FUCKING STUPID!\" And then continued to go on, very agitated that I always make assumptions that he knows what he doesn't. \n\nI responded with \"get out.\" Repeatedly. Calmly. I know how much I give and bring to the table, I wasn't about to be yelled at andhave to deal with a mad-at-me-for-being-mad scenario. \n\nHe gathered his things and left. It's been almost a week and I have heard nothing from him. I really think it's over because of lasagna.

Even if the house was not boiling hot, cooked food in general is not fine. No cooked food (which has already cooled down), should be left outside of fridge more than 1h. Bacteria multiplies as time passes and the risk of food poisoning increases. 14h is too long\nOnly a fool would eat food left out that long.\nBTW, I used to have to do annual F&B certification (it included a knowledge test), when working in hotels as I dealt with H&S.", "I would gladly have still eaten it.  But I have very low health and safety standards.  Which is probably why I never get sick.", "I agree. This was standard practice in our house if it wasn\u2019t super hot, the dish wasn\u2019t chicken or fish, and we weren\u2019t putting licked spoons back in the dish. Decades of this and no food poisoning.", "You are all missing the point. It doesn't matter if the food was safe or not. Op made a perfectly normal request and rather than say he didn't know or apologize that he forgot, the ah screamed in her face.\n\nThat would be a dealbreaker for me", "To quote my favorite clown, \"Mustard? How about Mustard gas!\"", "Maybe you\u2019ve counted him out too soon", "Ask your professor the next time you see them. And visit some countries in Europe and Africa. We leave food overnight in the oven or on the counter, and it's fine.", "It's funny because I've had the same scenario. Accidently left a lasagna out overnight. Because of how labor intensive it was, I didn't want to throw it away, also didn't want to get sick.  I called my BIL, who was professionally trained in food safety.  He said not to risk it.  Rip lasagna!!", "Technically they are. But no one wants to eat ashes.", "Good to know", "I am European, and something being the done thing doesn't make it safe, right, or good. Some foods can be left out if covered, high risk ones cannot, it's not worth the risk. On average, 420,000 people die annually from food poisoning, and many more (100's of millions) are very sick.", "Archer has entered the chat\n\n\n\u201cDanger zone\u201d"]}
