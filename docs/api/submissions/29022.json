Parents favoring one child over another created misery for years until now (and in to far future). If they do not understand what they have caused, the problematic behaviour will not stop.\n2. Your behaviour very likely hurt every emotionally aware person in that room. You are still growing and your emotions boiled over- it is a miracle you held on until now. It is good that you showed your view of the situation. The way you did it was unnecessarily cruel/explosive. It likely came so suddenly that the parents only see it as a sudden event- and not as a camel's back breaking point. \n3. Youngest child has grown in a bubble and has not learned emotional ques. Adults gave your sister constant attention for years and fed her a view of a world where she is the world and everyone else is satellites working around her. Maybe she doesn't have friends of her own age? It seems that she doesn't understand where the lines of appropriateness go- even among family. \nWhole situation is messed up and everyone needs councelling help or group therapy. \nParents are still living in their old world view where the fear of loss,  uncertainty of the future, monetary difficulties, over vigilance on the sister, and hiding depression were their Rules of Their world. If love creayes pink glasses, then pain and fear give dark shutters that blind you from everything else. Taking them off is difficult. Your act might have cracked those glasses open OR shook them more shut. Either way, you need to talk with your parents and verbalize your hurt. Write things down beforehand and if they do not listen to you- give them the written list. It is only a back-up measure because written words cannot always carry emotions out the right way. Please talk.\n! Your sister might not yet be available for the deepness of the talk you need to have with your parents. Instead of the long version, keep it short with her for now. Explain to her that you used your own money to buy the computer and it is also a gift to you /from your friends/. It is not something you can give away- but you can loan it to her occasionally /when you are not planning to use it yourself/. Keep your boundaries clear- she needs to understand that you are safe person who keeps to their word and not a handmaid.  Tell in small words that you were hurt when you were her current age when your parents forgot your important events, and that you still love her and your parents very much. Give her examples that she can relate to- has she brought home exam papers where she succeeded? Ask then how she would feel if the parents only said ok and kept making the dinner. Keep things simple- you know how a kid her age understands the world.\nYour parents should love their children as equally as possible.\nYour feelings are yours.
