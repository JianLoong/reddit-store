Your behaviour very likely hurt every emotionally aware person in that room. You are still growing and your emotions boiled over- it is a miracle you held on until now. It is good that you showed your view of the situation. The way you did it was unnecessarily cruel/explosive. It likely came so suddenly that the parents only see it as a sudden event- and not as a camel's back breaking point. \n3. Youngest child has grown in a bubble and has not learned emotional ques. Adults gave your sister constant attention for years and fed her a view of a world where she is the world and everyone else is satellites working around her. Maybe she doesn't have friends of her own age? It seems that she doesn't understand where the lines of appropriateness go- even among family. \nWhole situation is messed up and everyone needs councelling help or group therapy. \nParents are still living in their old world view where the fear of loss,  uncertainty of the future, monetary difficulties, over vigilance on the sister, and hiding depression were their Rules of Their world. If love creayes pink glasses, then pain and fear give dark shutters that blind you from everything else. Taking them off is difficult. Your act might have cracked those glasses open OR shook them more shut. Either way, you need to talk with your parents and verbalize your hurt. Write things down beforehand and if they do not listen to you- give them the written list. It is only a back-up measure because written words cannot always carry emotions out the right way. Please talk.\n! Your sister might not yet be available for the deepness of the talk you need to have with your parents. Instead of the long version, keep it short with her for now. Explain to her that you used your own money to buy the computer and it is also a gift to you /from your friends/. It is not something you can give away- but you can loan it to her occasionally /when you are not planning to use it yourself/. Keep your boundaries clear- she needs to understand that you are safe person who keeps to their word and not a handmaid.  Tell in small words that you were hurt when you were her current age when your parents forgot your important events, and that you still love her and your parents very much. Give her examples that she can relate to- has she brought home exam papers where she succeeded? Ask then how she would feel if the parents only said ok and kept making the dinner. Keep things simple- you know how a kid her age understands the world.\nYour parents should love their children as equally as possible.\nYour feelings are yours.

I\u2019m so sorry, honey. You\u2019re just a kid and you deserve to be treated like one. \n\n\nI remember being 16 and how angry I was all the time. Be angry, you\u2019ve earned it. I think it\u2019s important to let yourself feel that anger so you can let your feelings flow instead of just having it build up. NTA, they\u2019re supposed to be your parents.", "Sweetheart, you are NTA - you are the outsider. Your parents ARE the AHs though for always putting you nowhere. I completely empathise with how you are feeling and I wonder if you have any grandparents/close friends that maybe you could stay with for a little bit? You (and your folks) need time away from each other in order to process what happened.\n\nPlease never think you are less, you are not. In fact you are more because you have morals & values. You have a job and you save your money in order to buy something that matters to you. You folks don't give a crap what things you have. All they want is everything that stops sister having a meltdown. They also want you to be the same as them. Don't, stay strong, stay focused and remain determined. God bless you.", "NTA  but this is above reddits paygrade. You might want to find a place to hide your laptop for now since it might just be given to your sister. Go to the school nurse or guidance counselor and talk to them- you really need an adult in your corner for this. They can hopefully get you therapy services to help you navigate and support you. Having a child that has cancer is very difficult to navigate as a parent, but you can't do all of that at the expense of another child. Focus on the future, start saving your money to get out at 18, you can also double up and start applying  for college. I'm sorry your parents are so awful to you.", "I feel like children\u2019s hospitals have a LOT of amazing resources. There should have been a family counselor or social worker that was utilized to help the family navigate exactly this situation. I know it happens, so much attention gets focused on the sick kid, the other sibling(s) kind of get brushed aside. I mean, if Op had her own thing going on- sports, drama club, choir, band, etc- would the parents have just never gone to anything??? They need a family counselor.", "NTA\n\nIt is unfortunate that your sister got sick, but that is not your fault. It is not your responsibility to make her happy. Your parents dropped the ball on this BIG time. While trying to make sure one daughter was ok, they completely forgot they had another daughter. Of course it would make you angry that they expect you to give up one more thing--something you bought with your own money--to your sister. \n\nAND it is problematic that they STILL don't see what they've done and why you would have a negative reaction to it. In my state, 16 year olds can get therapy without their parents' permission. I would look into that because you need some confirmation that you are not a second class citizen, and you deserve than to be treated like this. I would save more money so I could move out when I turned 18.", "NTA\n\nYou're 16, depending on the rules of your country and what the age of your majority is; you could go to the courts and ask to be emancipated from them. Courts are more willing to hear out someone closer to the age of majority on this and grant it. You already have a job and the government would put you on subsidized housing and stuff until you were out of school. This is an extreme to be sure, but it is an option.\n\nWhat you should do is go to guidance counselors at school. Tell them what's going on and tell them you need to talk to someone. The school will get in contact with a school therapist for now and they can help you get in touch with a \"real\" one. If money is an issue, there are programs for young people such as yourself to get help depending on where you live. I say school vs real because school counselors and therapists aren't equip to deal with certain things in detail like the others are, they are meant to be there to start the process and get you in touch with another that can work with you in detail. Make sure you tell them what your home life is exactly like and that speaking to these people is not an option as they seem to either ignore your needs or they think you are \"over reacting\", that way therapy will be focused on how to help you without having a support system  within the family. Do this as soon as possible, because the long-term effects of this type of situation are astronomical. Sure, you can say that you don't feel this way or that way right now, but later on in your 30's and 40's this shit will start to manifest in ways that you don't understand and ways that will make life a lot harder. I've seen it happen and it's not good for the person.\n\nAfter all this, you can talk to your therapist about emancipation and if it's a good idea. If they say it's not for whatever reason, then what I would do is start saving every penny, nickel, and dime I could. Start busting your ass for a scholarship to a university you want, or any university rather; anything that will get you away from them. If you have to, start taking summer courses or night classes to boost grades from years past that matter. Most of the time from grades K-7 they don't really care about mainly look at your grades from 8 and up. The work you put into your grades now and into boosting your grades from past years also shows that you are willing to put in the work and that you are a contender for that scholarship. If you can trust your boss and if your boss is cool, tell them what's going on, tell them what you plan to do and if there is a way they can help. I had a boss like this at your age. It was the best thing that happened to a lot of us that worked for her. Who knows, they might be able to give you more shifts, give you a raise if you can't take any more shifts, maybe even give you a place to get away while being paid for it. I know not every single boss is like that and they are very rare these days, but who knows. If you feel comfortable telling them and they can help, you should try and at least get some sort of support there too.\n\nNow, I know you say your parents absolutely don't give a shit about you, and from what you put they don't. What you need to look out for is them suddenly taking an interest in your social media, schooling, and anything else, because they sound like the type that would immediately take an interest only to be snooping in your private business and trying to use it against you. They will \"want to know what's going on in your life\" but not to actually care but more so to see how badly you plan to burn them or whatever and try to stop that from happening. If you have to, get rid of all your social media, or make a new one that they don't know about. Use a completely different user name, birthday, whatever, but if you use social to keep in touch with friends and talk, it's best to have one they know nothing about so you have people to still talk to and have a support system. make sure you keep any valuables close to you and make sure your ID and whatnot is yours and only you have access to it. \n\nI know all this sounds over the top for something so simple as a parent-child disagreement, but parents like this sometimes swing completely in the reverse direction with the worst intent possible as a punishment for the seemingly obedient and controlled child to put them back in-line. They don't know any other way to do it because they are in shock about the sudden disobedience. Some swing back in the other direction hard because they now feel extremely guilty and want to try and correct it all at once and do damage control for you, while the intent is good it's not the best way to go about it. First step, talk to your school counselor and ask for help. If you feel you can, talk to you parents about it and if not, continue to just talk to the counselor and therapist until you can get help in getting to a \"real\" one. This is the first step that you need to take for yourself and your future.", "NTA but if I were you, I'd ask friends to keep the computer at their house when you are not around because I'm pretty sure that your parents and your sister will put their nasty hands on it.\nGood luck !", "Keep the laptop with you at all times, or at a trusted friends' place.

Something like : The moment our son turned 18, he stopped talking to us and moved out. NTA OP but you do need to address this with your parents. Their either not realising what they\u2019re doing or are extremely ignorant. Do you not have grandparents you could talk to?

They have made this their lifestyle for a decade. \n\nWhat do you need to finish high school and get to your next step? Why not ask them for that? \n\nIf it was me, I'd be asking them what they planned to cover vis a vis college and then plan accordingly. Are they planning to pay tuition? What are their thoughts about your ability to continue living in the house. Do they consider you an equal member of the family? Do they consider you a tenant? A housekeeper? What are you to them? Would it be better (and I would offer this with sincerity) for you to move in with another family member?\n\nI'm sorry they are like this, but don't expect or believe they will change significantly. Don't give your sister anything else unless you feel like it.

Is there another family member you can go live with, so that you can be treated as a valued child for a change?", "NTA.\n\n\"Let's clear the air. You have ignored and neglected me for years and loot what I own to give to her. You feel entitled to steal from me to gift her things. Am I not your child too? Is this seriously what you think good parenting looks like? Ignoring one child to favor the other their entire life? I saved and bought that laptop myself, why do you feel entitled to take it from me? Why does your mind automatically favor her in everything? Do you just plan to favor her forever, while stealing from me, forgetting my birthdays, and acting like I don't matter? She's been healthy three years, if she covets my laptop, tough, she can deal, but she won't be playing with it, I can promise you that.\"\n\nJust make sure it isn't home when you confront them.", "NTA\n\nI truly hope it got through to them a little.

As long as they aren\u2019t just terrible people they probably don\u2019t even think what they are doing is that wrong. One choice is to accept they are bad parents and aren\u2019t equipped emotionally, but are trying to do the best they could at the time, meaning that it\u2019s not about you and it\u2019s not personal.

You need to get out of there if you can. Do you have grandparents or other relatives you can stay with? Then go stay with them. These people are never going to give you your full value no matter what happens. It also sounds like they are living far above their means if they have to steal from you to give to her. They probably have a lot of medical debt, or maybe they\u2019re just totally irresponsible. You should be able to buy basics like a mattress and some electronic devices for all your kids.

There was no TV, all of the other kids were too ill to talk, and she\u2019d get  super behind in class. When she was out of hospital though, all she wanted to do was race up the street and play with the neighbourhood kids; she\u2019d drag me away from my books and force me to socialise! \n\n\nMy friend, whilst never bullied, really struggled to make a lot of friends at school - she was off like half the year!

There was a bit of an age gap and he\u2019d be expected to share all of his electronics with her and let her (along with me) into his room.

They\u2019re civil, but it\u2019s so sad to me that she considers me more a sister than he a brother. She also has to contend with her crushingly overprotective parents.

We are the only person guaranteed to be with us until the day our souls move on to their next adventures. In this way, we are very precious, precious commodities that need and DESERVE to be nurtured, protected, and revered.\n\nWe should all have the opportunity to learn to love ourselves more than everybody else put together. Not in self-centered or egocentric ways but in self-care, self-acceptance, and self-preservation kinds of ways.

You need to seek a counsellor or therapist. Your parents perhaps need to as well. Your sister is just in it. She has grown up used to it so she won't even think anything of taking things from you but perhaps this might be an eye opener for her. Hopefully. Depends on your parents next move. They could reinforce her entitlement or they can realise the pain you are feeling and talk to you. I hope it's the latter.\n\nGood luck OP. You've made it this far.

This physically made my heart hurt reading this due to similar experiences\u2026\nYou should be proud of yourself for using your voice and standing up for yourself, especially since it seems no one else in your family has your back.\nYou were cheated repeatedly out of a normal childhood, out of love, and out of basic respect.\n\nObviously a child with an illness as serious as cancer is devastating, and it\u2019s easy to get tunnel vision. Any parent should want to do everything possible to make what may be a short life as beautiful and special as they can\u2026 but not at the expense of their other child. They failed you, OP, not the other way around.\n\nWhile I think it\u2019s worth a shot, I don\u2019t imagine that your parents can be reasoned with about this\u2026 \nMy only advice to you is to start looking to friends for emotional support, finding a guidance counselor or something that can advise you about \u201cadulting,\u201d and start saving up to get the heck out of there and put some distance between you and this toxicity as soon as possible.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to struggle with this, OP. You deserve better and I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA. I am so sorry you experienced this. It is not uncommon for the sibling of a sick child to feel left out and resentful. My cousin was very ill as a child and her brother, whilst he was loving to her, did feel left out at times (all good now and they're best of friends). My younger son was having medical tests for seizures when he was seven, and his older brother got resentful at the attention, too (never behaved badly, but I could tell he felt left out). \n\nYour parents went through terrible stress when your sister was ill, but they unwittingly made you feel second best and neglected your needs and feelings. \n\nI think your blow-up needed to happen and will hopefully shock your parents into realising how it has been for you over the years.\n\nDo you have a sympathetic relative or family friend who could help you and speak to your parents on your behalf.\n\nWould you be willing to share the laptop with your sister and her friends on just one occasion?

I waited until mid 20s and wish I had started sooner. If you can\u2019t until you\u2019re 18, that\u2019s okay. But this shit is painful, traumatizing, and long lasting. Try and get the support you can when and where you can get it. You\u2019re gonna be okay.", "The way I see it is your parents treated your sister with extra attention because they were afraid of losing her too early, while their actions likely will cause them to lose the other child because of their neglect. You need to make it clear they are losing you, and they can't put a pin in your relationship and expect you to be there for them later.", "NTA \n\nHonestly, I'd make sure you take the laptop with you to school.

Hopefully your parents see the error of their ways, but... That rarely happens.", "Not the asshole at all.  I can understand that sometimes in that situation one sibling would fall on the back burner, but making it a way of life is incredibly damaging to you.  It sounds like they have gone totally overboard and you are really lacking the love and respect you deserve from your parents.  I'm sorry you've been living in a shadow that forces you to resent the situation and likely also your sister to a degree.  You matter.

You'll need it for your education. AND you bought it with your own money and gift money from your friends. Your parents gave nothing towards it. \n\nI'm furious on your behalf that your parents even mentioned buying your sister a gaming laptop. Why not buy you one?  Why did you have to get a job to buy it yourself?  The audacity to think they had any right to your laptop \n\nYour parents are raising a spoiled entitled brat. She's 14, who she is may already be ingrained. Did she say sorry or apologize?  Or apologize on behalf of her parents? I think the answer is \"no\" . I think no one apologized for anything but they expect you to.  The only thing you could apologize for is the cursing yet this was bottled up for so long its to be expected. \n\nIt sucks that got younger sister was seriously sick. But your parents had two children, you had needs as well. Instead resources that should have gone to you,  went to your sister. You were an afterthought.\n\nDidn't help that your home environment wasn't stable by being tossed around to live with someone's else's home. You lose your sense of safety and security  \n\nTheir behavior has been going on for years.  Yet your sister has been \"normal\", guessing you mean in remission,  for the last 3 years.  She's been healthy,  going to school, making friends, etc. She is not bedridden. She can have friends over,  she is no longer isolated. \n\nYour parents' response leads me to believe they think they did nothing wrong. They give you food, bed, clothes and think their job is done. Far from it.\n\nThey do not recognize the emotional and mental abuse they have put you through and continue to put you through.\n\nIf you want,  write a list. Grab paper, draw line down the middle top to bottom. On the top left side write your name and other side your sister's.\n\nStart from this year and work your way back through your gift history for Christmas and birthdays. What you got,  what she got.  If something you received went to your sister, draw an arrow \u27a1\ufe0f from your gift towards your sister's side. If you receive a gift that was not a guy gift (jewelry kit) circle the item since it obviously was never meant for you and draw the arrow. Take a photo of it.  Did they ever get you a phone or only your sister? \n\nThis may or may not do anything in how your parents treat you (or just keep it for yourself) .  Maybe seeing in written down will help them see how unfairly they have been treating both of their children (one deprived,  one spoiled). If may make no difference,  but they can't say they didn't know. If by some chance your parents go overboard in the reverse and ignore your sister, you need to stop them in their tracks. Don't be them.\n\nWhen wrapping gifts I think they realized they'd gotten nothing for you or not enough and stores were closed so gave one of her gifts went to you so you'd have something to open. They may even have said something along the line so you could play together. \n\nAre you in the US?\n\nYour 16. Not much you can do about anything at this time regarding family. You can control yourself and your decisions and your future. \n\nYou've demonstrated hard work, drive/focus, and self control. \n\nYou wanted a gaming laptop, that was your focus  You then got a job on top of school to get it, hard work. There were other things you wanted, but you didn't,  you continued to save until you could afford the laptop, that was self control. \n\nYou have a gaming laptop. That's pretty poweful equipment. You like gaming, have you ever thought about making your own game? Or learning anything online with your laptop to help you build a future?\n\nThere are tons of free courses online. Also certificates (some might be free or little cost). Learn different softwares and build portfolios of your work.\n\nAlso if you decide to go to college/university you can test out of entry level  courses and earn the credits towards your degree.  It's called credit by exam and CLEP. You can test out of your first year, meaning you'll get done faster. Not all colleges accept them,  so see which will when the time comes.   Look into it and start learning now.   \n\nExamples of courses: algebra,  calculus, biology, microeconomics, information systems, marketing,  languages \n\nTech schools you'll get done faster and can start a career. No tech school offers all the same ptograms: air traffic controller,  radiologist,  aviation maintenance, dental assistant, cyber security,  accounting, welding, paralegal,  etc.\n\nYou're smart and driven. Use that to build a better future for yourself. \n\nNTA", "You are not TA. If I could hug you through the screen I would give you a big mama hug so hard and for so long. Your parents have created a habit because they lived in fear of losing your sister for years and had a lot of responsibilities associated with her treatments, and it's hard to let that go and create a new normal and not live in fear. In the meantime, you must have adapted so well and showed so much patience and bravery that they also got used to a pattern there as well. I grew up the same way, vastly different expectations, vastly different discipline, and it felt very much like I wasn't loved as much, very often. I wish I wound have done something about it back then, but when i tried and they did nothing, \ni have up. It's easier to look back and be able to put it into words as an adult, and I was scared to push it. Your parents shouldn't be mad at you, in fact, unless they're extremely dense, your words have run through their heads over and over and they're upset with themselves. They have a responsibility as parents to come to you and listen to how you feel. If they don't come to you soon, I urge you to sit them down. In either scenario, before you begin, ask that they listen and fully hear you out without interrupting, ask them to acknowledge your request before you begin. Then it's your turn. Be respectful by not raising your voice, if you feel like crying, cry. This is your opportunity to share with them how you feel forgotten, less important, and want to feel like an equal priority and that these feelings have been building over many years. If they can't listen, then write them a letter. As a mom of boys, it breaks my heart to imagine one of my guys feeling the way you do. Once you get out how you feel, consider what your \"ask\" is. Maybe you ask them to respect your boundaries with your belongings, that gifts are equal and thoughtful, that they spend equal quality time with YOU, etc. You have less than 2 years left before you are 18. They lost a lot of time in hospitals and you will soon go on to live your own life. All you can do is try to be heard and ask for what you want. At least that way, you won't live with regrets like I do. I have had to hide things from people outside of family that I went through due to my parents lack of action for over 40 years and I wish things go differently for you. I'll keep you in my thoughts. You matter, you are important, and you are special.", "NTA. Sounds like you finally hit your breaking point, and it was completely justified.", "Dad here.  I lost a cousin to leukemia when I was 21 and she was 14, and lost my own son to leukemia 3 years ago when he was 22.\n\nHaving a child with leukemia is one of the most dramatically awful and heartbreaking things I can imagine.  You don't know if that child is going to live or die.  The chemotherapy treatment, for my cousin and my son, were brutal.  Both of my family members would have died without a stem cell transplant, and the high intensity chemo to prepare the body for a stem cell transplant will also kill you if the transplant doesn't arrive in a timely manner.  My family members were completely dependent on blood donors to keep them alive, as their bodies lose there ability to make red blood cells and platelets (cells that allow your blood to clot).\n\nAnd even when the treatment is successful, the patient is immunocompromised.  Simple stuff that people shrug off can kill a leukemia patient, and this condition goes on for years.  Oh, and if none of those things kill you, the transplant can kill you.  The body can reject a stem cell transplant, leading to a painful and tortuous death.\n\nMy family was very fortunate in that we were surrounded by friends and family who made every wish for our boy come true.  Gaming systems, hotels stays, Cameo messages, luxurious meals, streaming service subscriptions, groceries, housecleaning services, you name it.  \n\nAll this to say, your parents have been through some shit.  I'm sure I still don't know the many ways I overlooked, forgot about or took for granted my beautiful daughter while my son was sick.  \n\nI don't blame you at all for what you're feeling or what you said.  Your response is perfectly natural.  While you may not have been as aware of the dire condition your sister was in, your suffered considerably in your own way.  I'm sorry this happened to your family and for how it has impacted your life.  It doesn't sound like your family had the fortune of generous (aka wealthy) supporters.  I'm sorry your family didn't get the same.  \n\nGive your parents a chance to respond to this.  Ask them about seeing a therapist to help deal with this resentment.  Ask them about having the whole family see a family therapist.  You've all been through a lot and deserve to chance to openly and honestly heal with the guidance of a professional.", "My heart hurts for you. The positive thing is you are resilient and independent. Meanwhile your sister will struggle with those things. She may grow up  resenting your parents for this so they aren't doing either of you any favours. You need an advocate to speak for you. Don't you have a school counselor you can go to, or someone from the hospital who counsels family members of cancer patients? If so, please go to them. Sometimes people will listen more willingly to a third party and you need this. This will affect you long term. My ex had a similar experience and grew up to be a narcissist and he (36) is probably too old to change. Not saying you will become a narcissist, but the sooner you deal with it, the better the emotional outcome.\nAll the best to you!", "Nta but it\u2019s not about the laptop or the clothes.

Make them realise that they feared to lose a child but you lose your family and that you want this to change.", "NTA \n\nAbusers don\u2019t get to cry victim as soon as their victim fights back. They deserved every bit of what you did and so much more. I wish I could tell you that they\u2019ll change, but I think they\u2019re too far gone. Even if they weren\u2019t the damage is irreparable at this point. If I were you I\u2019d try to minimize contact with them as much as possible, however if they try to ask or demand you \u201cshare\u201d anything of yours again; especially anything you bought with your own money don\u2019t. Tell them that you refuse and if they attempt to take it anyway against your will or give it to her tell them you\u2019ll be filing a police report for theft. Regardless of the fact that they\u2019re your parents you bought the item with your own money, and have proof of purchase. \n\nYou have a couple options as far as getting yourself out of this situation. Look up rooms for rent and try to find the cheapest one that you can afford, or see if a friends family would let you stay there for a token rent amount. If so you could file for emancipation, you\u2019d just need to prove that you\u2019ll have a way to earn income, have a place to stay, and that your education won\u2019t be affected. Outside of that you could always ask if a family member would let you stay there until you turn 18, I know it won\u2019t be much better emotionally but atleast your items will be safe. Lastly and the most painful, stick it out until you\u2019re 18. \n\nTry to raise your grades as much as possible, see if you\u2019re eligible for scholarships and/or grants. If you\u2019re not then you can take out a loan for school, those loans can also be used to pay for board and food during the duration of your education. If you want to do a trade you can take a lot of manual jobs without trade school, you\u2019ll eventually have to further your education; but you can be hired as an apprentice electrician for example with zero training before hand, then you can do schooling to get your journeyman\u2019s or masters down the line. A lot of employers will actually pay for that if you stay for a certain period of time (ex. 2 years). You have options don\u2019t feel like you have to stay, and don\u2019t let yourself believe you can\u2019t become independent and get away from it all. \n\nYou won\u2019t start healing until you\u2019re away from them all, you need distance. You need boundaries, (that\u2019s of course if you even want contact with them at all). They probably won\u2019t ever come to the realization that they fucked you over until they can\u2019t get ahold of you anymore. Until they\u2019re stuck realizing that their actions are the reason they\u2019ve lost you entirely. As far as your sister, while I feel bad that she was sick she\u2019s every bit as culpable. She knows that it\u2019s wrong to take every single thing away from you, she knows it\u2019s wrong that you\u2019re treated significantly differently. She just doesn\u2019t care because the dynamic favors her. She\u2019s been led to believe that it\u2019s okay to act the way she does, that it\u2019s okay to steal from you. She followed your parents lead. \n\nYou two could probably come together down the line, but she has a lot of growing up to do. I wouldn\u2019t even consider it until she can verbally admit herself that what was going on is wrong. If she can\u2019t do that any relationship you attempt to have is going to be filled with resentment. You also need to be independent and have your own life so that you can event attempt to start a relationship on equal footing. By that I mean that the relationships genuine, not that you\u2019re interacting because you\u2019re scared of what your parents might take away otherwise. The only way to regain power and stop feeling helpless is to stand on your own two feet away from them. To have a life they can\u2019t ruin, steal, or take advantage of. That if they start to cross boundaries again, you have a safe haven and can afford to cut contact with zero lifestyle repercussions to you. I hope you\u2019re able to heal, I hope you get out of there, I hope you continue to hold your ground and refuse to let them take anymore, I hope you find happiness and find people that actually treat you like a human worthy of the love and respect you absolutely deserve.\n\nEDIT: Start carrying that laptop with you. Bring it with you to school, work, etc. DO NOT leave it at the house unattended. They\u2019ve shown over and over again that they don\u2019t care about your autonomy, wishes, or personal affects. I don\u2019t care if you have to look funny carrying a backpack with you everywhere you go, or if disconnecting it is a headache. Better that you have to lug around a backpack, or take 15 min to get everything together every morning, then to come home from work today to find out it\u2019s gone. Or that they\u2019ve \u201ctaken it away as punishement\u201d and gave it to your sister \u201cbecause she deserves it\u201d. I\u2019d still make it known that if they try you\u2019ll be filing charges, but I still wouldn\u2019t risk that they won\u2019t call your bluff and try it anyway. So protect it.\n\nEDIT 2: If they signed on for your bank account, and you can\u2019t open a new one on your own; start withdrawing everything you have and keep it on you.

And considering them you can either treat them hostile, indifferent or pretend everything is good. \n\nThe first one will waste a lot of emotional energy, because it will just create additional friction during the time you should invest in preparing your exit. On the offsite blowing off the steam might feel good in the moment, but I chose this option with my father and it is one of the reasons I am in depression since nearly 10 years. \n\nThe indifference option is propably the one that will cost the least emotional stress, because you just treat everything like you dont care. And since they already dont care you can achive that by just doing the chores that are expected quietly and avoiding contact as much as possible. \n\nThe last one would propably give you most freedom, since they wont expect it if you pretend everything is good. I mean you already described how unaware they are. \n\nFor now plan your exit in a safe way (having your own bank account where they cant access it as soon as possible, knowing where your important documents are in the house, so you can get them at that day, talking with teachers and counselors about scolarships, paid apprenitceship programms or even the military etc and what you need for that, developing skillsets you can use to progress in jobs like excell, programming or handy work, earning and saving up money and getting good grades.)\n\nBesides that and for your own mental heath find something where you can get rid of the accumulated frustrations. A trusted friend or even teacher where you can vent, an activity where you can put all your anger and frustration into a physical acitvity or even poetry or art if they help you. Dont let it linger in you for years, because supressing emotions in that way becomes a habbit and once it is, its hard to get rid of. (Believe me I tried, my brain supresses my emotion so strong, that even when my body would be on the brink of breakdown from stress, anger or sadness it will just shut them down and prevent me from letting them out.) \n\nAnd if you want to be petty on your exit day, leave them the link to this post so they know why you dont want contact.", "She really didn't do anything, she's young,  been very sick and doesn't know aby better. it's the parents that have screwed it up", "Suspect they won\u2019t listen to OP, they\u2019ve shown that for too many years.

For her, for your parents, and also for you. Your parents made grave mistakes, and for years.

One day I hope you can talk openly about what you both went through and share a loving, supportive bond, although neither of you may be ready for that for a very long time. With your parents, you can express yourself with less anger and tell them what you experienced and how you feel about it. If they can\u2019t hear you without invalidating you, that really sucks.

One is that the parents are supposedly totally shocked and unaware that they\u2019ve favored one kid and one kid gets all the treats while the other is continually shortchanged. There are a lot of people that have one sick kid and they are aware that the other kid is being neglected. They usually make some effort to make things more equitable or tell the child they\u2019re loved at least. Not here. \n\nIt\u2019s been years since the sick sister has recovered. Most of the time with cancer patients, once treatment is over and they\u2019re recovered, that person is pretty much able to do whatever they want. This situation should have resolved literally years ago. But the parents have fallen into the pattern of \u201cone kid is going to be more important forever\u201d and it\u2019s not stopping. \n\nIf you read between the lines, it sounds like there\u2019s not a lot of money in the family. Could be financial mismanagement or medical bills, but either way, not OP\u2019s fault and at his age, not his problem. Whatever resources are available should be shared equally among all children. \n\nRead about about the Golden Child syndrome. That is when narcissistic parents have one child that is their favorite and can do nothing wrong, the other kids can\u2019t get away with the things Golden Child does and they are frequently neglected or abused in favor of the Golden Child. This is actually a thing. I\u2019m not making it up.\n\nThe Golden Child is usually thought to be smarter, prettier, more worthy etc than the other children. Sometimes another child is the Scapegoat Child that can do nothing right. These are signs of a narcissistic family dynamic. \n\nWe also had a sick Golden Child in the family.  My older sibling was sent away for years and went through a lot of trauma when they returned, because there was no emotional room in the family for them. They were just in the way. They ended up leaving home at seventeen because they felt there was just no place for them. It didn\u2019t work out well. \n\nSounds like OP is living the same thing.

It\u2019s their parents\u2019 personalities that are the issue, not OP, and he can\u2019t control their personalities.  It\u2019s way past the time the parents made an effort and they haven\u2019t. I hate to see a young person like this feel inferior when there are things they can read that will shed light on the situation. I think if OP read the stories at the link, they would recognize some things. Just because you had a sick child, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a great parent.", "You are deliberately misreading what I posted. I didn\u2019t say they didn\u2019t care about their daughter. I said they are using her illness as an excuse for why it\u2019s ok to be a shitty parent to the other kid. \n\nOP was literally sent away to live with relatives. Normally most people would say this was necessary because of circumstances, but when the daughter recovered and OP returned, that should have been the end of the favoritism. There is no excuse for this continuing. It is narcissistic to favor the child that makes other people feel sorry for you. OP\u2019s parents used this child to get sympathy and pity, 24/7 child care and who knows what other financial and other benefits from family and friends. Guess what, she\u2019s recovered now and everybody else has moved on except them. \n\nNow they are responsible for raising both children equally, just like anybody else would be. But in their minds, Go Fund Me Child is more worthy because that\u2019s where the sympathy comes from. That\u2019s a narcissistic trait. It has nothing to do with the illness of the child, the child isn\u2019t ill any more. The child has recovered and from the point of view of everyone else, it\u2019s time to go back to normalcy. If they can\u2019t do that, therapy exists for a reason. At least OP should have had access to therapy, because this is a horrible situation to be in. If the parents are continuing to do this years later, they need it too. \n\nI am skeptical of people with this level of family trauma who are obviously failing, but refuse to acknowledge or fix the problem. It\u2019s not up to the child to fix this, the parents are the adults and they should take the responsibility. But they refuse to admit their failure. That\u2019s where the narcissism comes in. Normal people know this is a big deal and they need to fix it. But if all your family problems are the fault of somebody else, a kid at that, that\u2019s narcissism.", "You're wrong.

They're totally invested in focusing on the sister.", "This comment was well said. There are a lot of very good suggestions and advice posted here. But if OP's parents were able to be reasoned with, they should have responded with remorse the moment OP let loose his hurt and laid open his broken heart to them. They should have put him back together and no amount of apologies could undo every hurt they gave, but the least they could do is try to mend the terrible damage they did to their OWN CHILD. Sadly, the only way these kind of people wake up is if they receive the treatment they deserve. The same treatment they've been giving, if they get it back from someone like OP who has so far been allowing them to walk all over him, they will at first treat him like a bunny who grew fangs. If OP stands his ground, the beginnings of self doubt will grow and make them wonder what they did to deserve this? At first they will shamelessly defend themselves and may try to distort the truth. But eventually if they have even a shred of humanity, they won't be able to deny what they did at the very least.", "I\u2019m like a million years older than you, kiddo, so I get my perspective is going to be different\u2026 still.

But kids who don't have exceptional needs still have needs.\n\nIt's also probably hard for parents to admit that they've fucked up so badly. All parents make mistakes, but this has been going on for years and years, and since no one called them out on it, they assumed everything was fine.
