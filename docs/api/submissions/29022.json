Parents favoring one child over another created misery for years until now (and in to far future). If they do not understand what they have caused, the problematic behaviour will not stop.\n2. Your behaviour very likely hurt every emotionally aware person in that room. You are still growing and your emotions boiled over- it is a miracle you held on until now. It is good that you showed your view of the situation. The way you did it was unnecessarily cruel/explosive. It likely came so suddenly that the parents only see it as a sudden event- and not as a camel's back breaking point. \n3. Youngest child has grown in a bubble and has not learned emotional ques. Adults gave your sister constant attention for years and fed her a view of a world where she is the world and everyone else is satellites working around her. Maybe she doesn't have friends of her own age? It seems that she doesn't understand where the lines of appropriateness go- even among family. \nWhole situation is messed up and everyone needs councelling help or group therapy. \nParents are still living in their old world view where the fear of loss,  uncertainty of the future, monetary difficulties, over vigilance on the sister, and hiding depression were their Rules of Their world. If love creayes pink glasses, then pain and fear give dark shutters that blind you from everything else. Taking them off is difficult. Your act might have cracked those glasses open OR shook them more shut. Either way, you need to talk with your parents and verbalize your hurt. Write things down beforehand and if they do not listen to you- give them the written list. It is only a back-up measure because written words cannot always carry emotions out the right way. Please talk.\n! Your sister might not yet be available for the deepness of the talk you need to have with your parents. Instead of the long version, keep it short with her for now. Explain to her that you used your own money to buy the computer and it is also a gift to you /from your friends/. It is not something you can give away- but you can loan it to her occasionally /when you are not planning to use it yourself/. Keep your boundaries clear- she needs to understand that you are safe person who keeps to their word and not a handmaid.  Tell in small words that you were hurt when you were her current age when your parents forgot your important events, and that you still love her and your parents very much. Give her examples that she can relate to- has she brought home exam papers where she succeeded? Ask then how she would feel if the parents only said ok and kept making the dinner. Keep things simple- you know how a kid her age understands the world.\nYour parents should love their children as equally as possible.\nYour feelings are yours.

I\u2019m so sorry, honey. You\u2019re just a kid and you deserve to be treated like one. \n\n\nI remember being 16 and how angry I was all the time. Be angry, you\u2019ve earned it. I think it\u2019s important to let yourself feel that anger so you can let your feelings flow instead of just having it build up. NTA, they\u2019re supposed to be your parents.", "Sweetheart, you are NTA - you are the outsider. Your parents ARE the AHs though for always putting you nowhere. I completely empathise with how you are feeling and I wonder if you have any grandparents/close friends that maybe you could stay with for a little bit? You (and your folks) need time away from each other in order to process what happened.\n\nPlease never think you are less, you are not. In fact you are more because you have morals & values. You have a job and you save your money in order to buy something that matters to you. You folks don't give a crap what things you have. All they want is everything that stops sister having a meltdown. They also want you to be the same as them. Don't, stay strong, stay focused and remain determined. God bless you.", "NTA  but this is above reddits paygrade. You might want to find a place to hide your laptop for now since it might just be given to your sister. Go to the school nurse or guidance counselor and talk to them- you really need an adult in your corner for this. They can hopefully get you therapy services to help you navigate and support you. Having a child that has cancer is very difficult to navigate as a parent, but you can't do all of that at the expense of another child. Focus on the future, start saving your money to get out at 18, you can also double up and start applying  for college. I'm sorry your parents are so awful to you.", "I feel like children\u2019s hospitals have a LOT of amazing resources. There should have been a family counselor or social worker that was utilized to help the family navigate exactly this situation. I know it happens, so much attention gets focused on the sick kid, the other sibling(s) kind of get brushed aside. I mean, if Op had her own thing going on- sports, drama club, choir, band, etc- would the parents have just never gone to anything??? They need a family counselor.", "NTA\n\nIt is unfortunate that your sister got sick, but that is not your fault. It is not your responsibility to make her happy. Your parents dropped the ball on this BIG time. While trying to make sure one daughter was ok, they completely forgot they had another daughter. Of course it would make you angry that they expect you to give up one more thing--something you bought with your own money--to your sister. \n\nAND it is problematic that they STILL don't see what they've done and why you would have a negative reaction to it. In my state, 16 year olds can get therapy without their parents' permission. I would look into that because you need some confirmation that you are not a second class citizen, and you deserve than to be treated like this. I would save more money so I could move out when I turned 18.", "NTA\n\nYou're 16, depending on the rules of your country and what the age of your majority is; you could go to the courts and ask to be emancipated from them. Courts are more willing to hear out someone closer to the age of majority on this and grant it. You already have a job and the government would put you on subsidized housing and stuff until you were out of school. This is an extreme to be sure, but it is an option.\n\nWhat you should do is go to guidance counselors at school. Tell them what's going on and tell them you need to talk to someone. The school will get in contact with a school therapist for now and they can help you get in touch with a \"real\" one. If money is an issue, there are programs for young people such as yourself to get help depending on where you live. I say school vs real because school counselors and therapists aren't equip to deal with certain things in detail like the others are, they are meant to be there to start the process and get you in touch with another that can work with you in detail. Make sure you tell them what your home life is exactly like and that speaking to these people is not an option as they seem to either ignore your needs or they think you are \"over reacting\", that way therapy will be focused on how to help you without having a support system  within the family. Do this as soon as possible, because the long-term effects of this type of situation are astronomical. Sure, you can say that you don't feel this way or that way right now, but later on in your 30's and 40's this shit will start to manifest in ways that you don't understand and ways that will make life a lot harder. I've seen it happen and it's not good for the person.\n\nAfter all this, you can talk to your therapist about emancipation and if it's a good idea. If they say it's not for whatever reason, then what I would do is start saving every penny, nickel, and dime I could. Start busting your ass for a scholarship to a university you want, or any university rather; anything that will get you away from them. If you have to, start taking summer courses or night classes to boost grades from years past that matter. Most of the time from grades K-7 they don't really care about mainly look at your grades from 8 and up. The work you put into your grades now and into boosting your grades from past years also shows that you are willing to put in the work and that you are a contender for that scholarship. If you can trust your boss and if your boss is cool, tell them what's going on, tell them what you plan to do and if there is a way they can help. I had a boss like this at your age. It was the best thing that happened to a lot of us that worked for her. Who knows, they might be able to give you more shifts, give you a raise if you can't take any more shifts, maybe even give you a place to get away while being paid for it. I know not every single boss is like that and they are very rare these days, but who knows. If you feel comfortable telling them and they can help, you should try and at least get some sort of support there too.\n\nNow, I know you say your parents absolutely don't give a shit about you, and from what you put they don't. What you need to look out for is them suddenly taking an interest in your social media, schooling, and anything else, because they sound like the type that would immediately take an interest only to be snooping in your private business and trying to use it against you. They will \"want to know what's going on in your life\" but not to actually care but more so to see how badly you plan to burn them or whatever and try to stop that from happening. If you have to, get rid of all your social media, or make a new one that they don't know about. Use a completely different user name, birthday, whatever, but if you use social to keep in touch with friends and talk, it's best to have one they know nothing about so you have people to still talk to and have a support system. make sure you keep any valuables close to you and make sure your ID and whatnot is yours and only you have access to it. \n\nI know all this sounds over the top for something so simple as a parent-child disagreement, but parents like this sometimes swing completely in the reverse direction with the worst intent possible as a punishment for the seemingly obedient and controlled child to put them back in-line. They don't know any other way to do it because they are in shock about the sudden disobedience. Some swing back in the other direction hard because they now feel extremely guilty and want to try and correct it all at once and do damage control for you, while the intent is good it's not the best way to go about it. First step, talk to your school counselor and ask for help. If you feel you can, talk to you parents about it and if not, continue to just talk to the counselor and therapist until you can get help in getting to a \"real\" one. This is the first step that you need to take for yourself and your future.", "NTA but if I were you, I'd ask friends to keep the computer at their house when you are not around because I'm pretty sure that your parents and your sister will put their nasty hands on it.\nGood luck !", "Keep the laptop with you at all times, or at a trusted friends' place.

Something like : The moment our son turned 18, he stopped talking to us and moved out. NTA OP but you do need to address this with your parents. Their either not realising what they\u2019re doing or are extremely ignorant. Do you not have grandparents you could talk to?

They have made this their lifestyle for a decade. \n\nWhat do you need to finish high school and get to your next step? Why not ask them for that? \n\nIf it was me, I'd be asking them what they planned to cover vis a vis college and then plan accordingly. Are they planning to pay tuition? What are their thoughts about your ability to continue living in the house. Do they consider you an equal member of the family? Do they consider you a tenant? A housekeeper? What are you to them? Would it be better (and I would offer this with sincerity) for you to move in with another family member?\n\nI'm sorry they are like this, but don't expect or believe they will change significantly. Don't give your sister anything else unless you feel like it.

Is there another family member you can go live with, so that you can be treated as a valued child for a change?", "NTA.\n\n\"Let's clear the air. You have ignored and neglected me for years and loot what I own to give to her. You feel entitled to steal from me to gift her things. Am I not your child too? Is this seriously what you think good parenting looks like? Ignoring one child to favor the other their entire life? I saved and bought that laptop myself, why do you feel entitled to take it from me? Why does your mind automatically favor her in everything? Do you just plan to favor her forever, while stealing from me, forgetting my birthdays, and acting like I don't matter? She's been healthy three years, if she covets my laptop, tough, she can deal, but she won't be playing with it, I can promise you that.\"\n\nJust make sure it isn't home when you confront them.", "NTA\n\nI truly hope it got through to them a little.

As long as they aren\u2019t just terrible people they probably don\u2019t even think what they are doing is that wrong. One choice is to accept they are bad parents and aren\u2019t equipped emotionally, but are trying to do the best they could at the time, meaning that it\u2019s not about you and it\u2019s not personal.

You need to get out of there if you can. Do you have grandparents or other relatives you can stay with? Then go stay with them. These people are never going to give you your full value no matter what happens. It also sounds like they are living far above their means if they have to steal from you to give to her. They probably have a lot of medical debt, or maybe they\u2019re just totally irresponsible. You should be able to buy basics like a mattress and some electronic devices for all your kids.

There was no TV, all of the other kids were too ill to talk, and she\u2019d get  super behind in class. When she was out of hospital though, all she wanted to do was race up the street and play with the neighbourhood kids; she\u2019d drag me away from my books and force me to socialise! \n\n\nMy friend, whilst never bullied, really struggled to make a lot of friends at school - she was off like half the year!

There was a bit of an age gap and he\u2019d be expected to share all of his electronics with her and let her (along with me) into his room.

They\u2019re civil, but it\u2019s so sad to me that she considers me more a sister than he a brother. She also has to contend with her crushingly overprotective parents.

The only thing that is of immense consequence to you is that you do your best to seek healing in whatever way you see fit.\n\nWhether it was through neglect or abuse, or just plain old shitty parenting, they didn't do their job. But that doesn't mean you can't step in where they egregiously failed. You can, and you are undeniably worth that.\n\nWe are all worth whatever resources are available to us and all that aren't, and whatever effort it takes on our own parts to seek and find healing. Nobody can take care of us as well as we are capable of taking care of ourselves. Nobody can love us as much as we are capable of loving ourselves.\n\nThink of it this way. We are the only person guaranteed to be with us until the day our souls move on to their next adventures. In this way, we are very precious, precious commodities that need and DESERVE to be nurtured, protected, and revered.\n\nWe should all have the opportunity to learn to love ourselves more than everybody else put together. Not in self-centered or egocentric ways but in self-care, self-acceptance, and self-preservation kinds of ways. Then we are able to love others in sincere, non-codependent, unconditional, and non-toxic ways.\n\nOP - If the fan stopped working on that new gaming laptop, you'd make sure to call the place you got it from and find out how to get it fixed, right?
