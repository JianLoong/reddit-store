{"id": 29786, "submission_id": "17hwni7", "title": "AITA for canceling my brother\u2019s baby shower after he made a hurtful joke about my miscarriage?", "selftext": "I am the oldest sibling out of four and my brothers have always been rough on me because I\u2019m a girl. By the way I\u2019m the only girl my parents had and all of my brothers are 1 year younger than me, they were triplets. I\u2019ve always been the one to be a second mom to my brothers because whenever our parents couldn\u2019t get it I would. One of my brothers had found a wife and they\u2019ve had a baby girl. I am very close to my brother and his wife and even his wife was excited to have me as the babies aunt. I love this baby with all of my heart being that this is my first niece and I plan on spoiling her because I\u2019m financially stable and even though I\u2019m not wealthy I still have a good amount of spending money. I also had a miscarriage about 2 years ago that was really hard on me so having a baby that I would be close with was extremely emotional and exciting for me. On the other hand my brother is not, he\u2019s very traditional and wants to be the breadwinner/ provider of his family. He and his wife want to have a baby shower but it would mean they would loose a great sum of money they can\u2019t afford. I\u2019ve offered to pay for the whole thing because I love them and the baby, plus it would be a beautiful moment for both sides of their family. My husband and I coordinated with them and payed for anything they wanted for the baby shower. A few weeks before the baby shower my brother, his wife, my husband, and my other brothers were at our parents house for a football game. The topic of babies and the baby shower they planned came up and my brother made a joke saying \u201c I\u2019m glad my wife is in working condition so we could be the first ones to have a baby, it feels good to be the first sibling for something.\u201d That really hurt because I was so excited to be having a baby but when me and my husband got the news it devastated us and it took us a while to become better. I went home crying and I blocked my brother on everything. I couldn\u2019t believe how inconsiderate and insensitive he was especially after I gave him everything. I texted him one time saying \u201cWe won\u2019t be paying for your baby shower anymore, what you did was horrible and I don\u2019t want to speak to you again.\u201d He told our family and now they\u2019re all trying to contact me but I don\u2019t want to hear it. So Reddit am I the asshole?\n\nUpdate\n\nIve been reading a lot of the comments and I would like to thank everyone who gave their support and opinion. I will be answering some common questions I\u2019ve been hearing \n\n1. What was the S. I. L. and families reaction?\nEveryone did not agree with this comment and the sister in law was pissed he even said something so rude. She texted me how sorry she was in his behalf and she says she totally understands why I made my decision.\n\n2. Did he apologize? \nHe believes he did nothing wrong so he\u2019s standing on his action. While I am upset by his blindness to how this could be hurtful I\u2019m not the kind to argue until I get an apology. \n\nI have made the decision to try to still give my sister in law a baby shower because she deserves it. I don\u2019t want to ruin my relationship with her or my niece so I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to give her a baby shower and still hold my grounds with my brother.

He literally said he\u2019s glad and happy your baby died, and there\u2019s no way in hell to turn this around. And no one should come to you with a \u201ethat\u2019s not what he meant\u201c - bc that\u2019s exactly what he meant.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting he's spinning the story, to make himself look good.

They were rough on you because they were bullies and it sounds as though this brother still is.  I also have three brothers and they would never, ever have said something so cruel and mean spirited.  Your brother can't have it both ways. He can't be an asshole to you and then expect that you to still pay for a baby shower.  Your family are probably trying to contact you so they don't get stuck with the bill.", "NTA. Please cut him off.

I'd love to think he said this by accident but when he said his wife is in \"working condition\"...that was so gross, I puked in my mouth a little.\n\nGeez, so sorry he had to hear that from someone you love.

I wouldn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life with someone capable of having such vile thoughts.", "Stop paying for your asshole family. They only see you as an ATM", "NTA. Your brother is a major AH though. He can pay for the baby shower himself. I hope his wife and the rest of your family really give him a hard time.", "NTA. You should ask him how he\u2019d feel if you were to comment about how grateful you are that you and your husband are in a financial stable working condition that you can be generous enough to extend financial assistance since he\u2019s unable to do it adequately for his growing family", "I think I\u2019m understanding this correctly. He\u2019s \u2018traditional\u2019 and feels he should be the provider. However, he couldn\u2019t afford the shower so you kindly stepped in to pay so everyone could celebrate. He\u2019s (incorrectly) perceived this lovely gesture as something emasculating and decided to knock you down a peg or too. While at the same time, showing his true misogynistic colours by talking about women like a good secondhand car. It\u2019s also very telling he wants to be the \u2018first at something\u2019. \n\nNTA what a mess. I\u2019m so sorry you had to hear that from someone you thought you were close to.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA, that was unbelievably horrible of him to say. And the fact that he doesn\u2019t realize how terrible it was is even worse. He is not owed a baby shower, especially when his actions are so callous. I feel bad for his wife but she must have known what he was like.", "NTA. I am so sorry op. Just reading this is devastating. Hugs. You deserve better. NC until he apologizes", "NTA NTA NTA everything else I have to say about your brother is unprintable.", "That was not a joke. That was a targeted, purposeful attack on you. Which is crazy, considering the fact that you were being so generous and loving. Please, please do not pay for their baby shower. He has to learn that he cannot speak to people that way.", "NTA.  You need to get away from every one of those assholes.\n\nAlso, it shouldn't be HIS baby shower.   It is for his wife and the baby...     \n\n  \n\"he's very traditional\"?  If he were, he wouldn't even be involved in the shower.  I'm not sure when men started attending these things, but I know it's been for a little while now.  All my life, this was a \"WOMEN ONLY\" gathering...  it should stay that way.", "NTA. His comment was not only incredibly insensitive but also really ignorant. Miscarriages aren't anyone's fault and it could have easily happened to his own wife/child. He should be counting his lucky stars every day.

Don\u2019t support this nonsense. It may feel sense to be the \u201cbigger\u201d person but no. Don\u2019t do it. This is unacceptable. He may resent you in some underlaying ways, hence why he said what he said. It\u2019s about power. He probably has a struggle finding power (being one of three) and then growing up underneath the power of an older sister (not insinuating anything about you but sometimes there is a classic power struggle between men and women) so just at least shake this off and do not take it personal. Everything he said is a reflection of him. Not of you. I am so sorry for your miscarriage. This must be immense pain and it is truly nuts for him to say something like this but it happens.", "NTA.  No reason to talk to any of them.", "NTA. Your brother is just awful.", "NTA. There is a way to say that he is happy to be able to be the first to provide Grandchildren without referring to woman as objects that are \"In working condition\" Truly a disgusting comment.", "NTA\nThat was beyond cruel to say and deeply misogynistic on top of that. Even if your NC is temporary, I suggest making it permanent. Anyone who can make a joke like that isn't someone you need in your life at all.\n\nI know there will be comments saying NTA while saying you shouldn't cut him off entirely, but if someone can say something like that, especially to someone who has done nothing but give and get nothing in return, they don't love you nor do they deserve you. \n\nAnd I am so sorry for your loss. I've never dealt with a miscarriage, but I did lose my ovaries due to ovarian cysts. Even for a woman like me who didn't really want children, we live in a society where our value and worth is so heavily tied to our reproductive capabilities. It isn't just that you miscarried, its that someone you love could call you damaged goods that makes it so painful and I understand that all too well. I really hope the best for you and again, I am so sorry you had to deal with those kinds of hurt.", "That\u2019s not a \u201cjoke\u201d you make.", "NTA. There\u2019s no expiration date on the pain of child loss. \n\n(She says 25 years later.)\n\nThe intensity changes. But that\u2019s all", "NTA, however, anyone in your family that tries to say it was just a joke and not take it so hard is an asshole and you should probably go low to no contact with them. \n\nAlso, any apology will feel not genuine because they still want that big first child bash-unless they apologize and say nothing about the bill they\u2019re willing to pay for. That was a horrifically fucked up thing to say to you, OP. And I\u2019m sorry that happened.", "ok this depends, was he always the last kid for stuff ? cause i feel like it can have a deeper meaning and why would stuff have to be directed to you? why do you think you\u2019re the most important?", "NTA. And there is a world in which your brother is so wrapped up in being a triplet that he absolutely was not thinking when he said what he said. And what he said was next level hurtful.

It's an unfortunate quirk of human genetics and development. In those cases, nothing you did or could have done would have made a difference either way.", "We lost our first decades ago, had 3 since. I feel a little bit guilty because way back then I was in a job I hated, in a town I hated having moved away from friends. I felt depressed and anxious and the thought of having a kid made everything worse. It was an ectopic pregnancy so it had to be aborted. My wife took it bad, but I was sort of relieved. After we moved, I liked my job, was feeling good and was really happy to become a father 3 times over. \n\nNTA. What's weird to me is maybe bro was trying to make a self-deprecating joke \"at least I'm first at something\" that blew up, but he didn't write to apologize, he went to the family to try to get you to pay up. Shizzle, man up dude and apologize. Of course, he sounds immature enough to try to maybe not have you see the baby etc.\n\nAs for baby shower -- I thought that was a woman thing? I didn't go to my wife's, I was out biking when they were oooh-ing and ahhh-ing at my sister's place. Not my kind of party anyhow. Spending lots on baby crap is financially foolish. We were flooded with useless toys and lots of hand-me-downs. The useful things were good strollers, Baby Bjorns. Save your money and invest it in index funds. When our babies were worn, our BIL bought them a couple thousand in Microsoft Stock. Each gift is worth almost $30K today. We started the kids saving and investing early. The kids loved Tesla early, so my oldest went all in on that. She's mid 20s, her portfolio is worth over $250K now. The \"poorest kid\" is worth $160K. Yeah, take that lavish party money and invest it and get a costco sheet cake and a few beers. You really accumulate tooooo much plastic junk with kids and how many fricking fast to grow out of outfits do you need?? Stock", "My Southern Baptist Pastor said the same thing to our congregation after I had my miscarriage. He said that happens to all babies who are miscarried. My (ex) husband and I walked out of that church. That was over 20 years ago and I haven\u2019t stepped foot in a church since. I cry if someone even mentions me attending church.", "Wow.  At our old Baptist church,  the pastor and I kind of got into an argument during Sunday school about how he felt babies don't have a soul until they breathe their first breath.  I not only just had a 2nd trimester loss a few months back, but I was about 7 months pregnant.   \n\nThat evening, he decided to get nasty while \"preaching.\" I got up, told my dad I was done and leaving.  He grabbed my daughter for me, the pastor then said something implying that I was in the wrong and couldn't handle it.  My dad was so red and screaming in his face.  If he wasn't holding my daughter,  I am pretty sure he would have beat the shit out of an elderly man, lol.  \n\nI am by all means still a Christian,  but we certainly don't go there anymore.   I have since been excluded, lol.", "Omg I love that revenge lmao that minister deserved all of that", "FAFO. Perfect.", "What kind of vicious god do those ministers believe in? I'm not religious and these attitudes are why I'm not. That's just beyond cruel", "I\u2019m not Baptist, but is this a common belief of that denomination? That\u2019s disgusting!", "And that pastor was wrong and stupid. if he is a Christian then he knows only God can say who is or isn\u2019t in heaven. what a mean spirited evil thing to say.", "My grandma was in her 80\u2019s and still mentioned her sadness over miscarried babies. I painted her a 5x7 water color black silhouette of a lady with string floating up to the sky tethered to two baby silhouettes. She asked to have that in her casket. I don\u2019t understand how people can be so cruel to people over this.", "That pain is woven into the fabric of your being and shapes your being and life forever.", "I was the twin that survived.

Big hugs to you.", "But, but....the breadwinner!! /s", "Since the brother is traditional and wants to be the bread winner, he needs to be the one paying for it anyway. The pregnant wife shouldn't even be working.", "Oh no - she\u2019s in \u2018working order\u2019 so she should be able to work until the day her labor starts.  \n\nWhat OP\u2019s brother said was so out of line it boggles the mind.  The majority of people in this world would not say anything like that to a person they disliked/hated - brother said it to a sister and her husband he supposedly loves and respects.\n\nLet the brother who IMO nuked the relationship with OP get other family members to pay for the baby shower.  And let other family members provide support when the baby arrives. \n\nI hope OP deals straight forwardly with anyone who tells her she overreacted.  One warning only she will not discuss the situation with anyone and if they bring it up again cut them off as well at least for a time.", "Yep, and not just that his sister is defective but summing his whole wife up as \u201cin working condition\u201d. How disgusting. I would be embarrassed as his wife hearing him say that even if it wasn\u2019t a dig at someone who\u2019d miscarried.", "Yes, it could.  By tradition, Baby Showers were never held before the child was actually born for that exact reason.  I will never forget my very kind friend Timmy, holding a surprise baby shower for a teacher, and getting blasted because he did not  have permission, and might have been getting gifts for a child that might never materialize.  I would rather have made his mistake than the one your evil brother did.", "I thought this too but didn\u2019t want to say it. I had a friend lose her baby the week the baby was due. It was shattering for her and her partner. He shouldn\u2019t be so stupid to think that they are out of the woods. Pregnancy and childbirth are a big ordeal and so many of my friends have experienced difficulties and traumas. Wtf is wrong with OPs brother?", "This. My BIL was a premie who died a few days after he was born. Birth is not \u201ceasy\u201d for Mom or Baby, and unfortunately bad things happen every day\u2026even in the Western world with top of the line modern medicine.", "Haha! Spot on!", "Tradicktional", "Like we are in the fucking 1900s!!!", "Right?  Who even conceives of that as something acceptable to say, to anyone, much less to a family member who has apparently shown nothing but care to them?", "Correct and that makes it even worse if the family is contacting OP to pressure her to forgive him, because \u201che didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded\u201d. I hope, I\u2019m wrong, and that\u2019s not their intent.", "I'm sorry for yours too. I was lucky enough to have a baby after those losses and that helped heal a lot of the pain but I still think of those babies and wonder who they might have been. It's weird missing someone you never met and who never existed outside your body.", "Good for you OP.  His ass should not be rewarded for his cruelty.", "Wow that makes it even worse, how could he not see how awful that would be to say. I\u2019m so sorry OP! NTA at all", "I suggested this somewhere else but I don't know how comments work / if you'd see it when I replied to someone else's comment.\n\nBut you wanted ideas how to have a shower for SIL but stand your ground with your ahole brother. I'm guessing you don't want to have a shower to which your brother isn't invited because that would put SIL in a horrible position.\n\nInstead, how about something like a ladies spa day that isn't technically a baby shower but where SIL gets pampered and it somehow is about celebrating your nibling? Or something else you know your brother wouldn't want to attend. Idk. It's a tough and shitty situation. You sound lovely and your brother is a tool.", "I\u2019m even more confused now- a gender reveal happens before the birth also? I mean, nothing much left to surprise people with when the baby is in the room! It sounds like a presents and attention grab for the parents, and nothing to do with the child at all. Tiny babies don\u2019t need or want parties. They want consistency and quiet love. I hope you get to spend lots of time with her and counteract the influence of her parents a bit.", "Ha! That\u2019s a hilarious tradition!", "I am Jewish but my husband is not. I joked that we could get 1/2 the stuff before the baby was born. But yes, it\u2019s traditional not to even bring any baby stuff into the house before the birth,", "Not until you calm down - until he apologizes.", "The fact that he foesnt even see how wrong it was for him to say that is disgusting", "INFO: please tell me they\u2019re not trying to get in contact because they, or at least the AH brother. expect you to apologize and feel guilty for what you did? \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, if being NC and then remaining LC is what\u2019s best for you, then do that. There is no \u201cjoke\u201d no matter how he tries to paint it. I\u2019m fact, if I were his wife/friend/other sibling, I\u2019d force him to tell me why it was funny just to watch him shrink as he realizes that you don\u2019t get a pass for saying shitty things when you paint it as a \u201cjoke.\u201d I would be so hurt and so angry and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re dealing with some of the grief all over again. So often women are made to feel broken for a variety of reasons especially when it comes to miscarriages even though they are unfortunately quite common. You are in no way the AH and unless and until he apologizes and admits he fucked up, along with an apology from anyone else who defends him, I\u2019d avoid contact.", "Honestly don\u2019t understand how your husband was able not to pop him in the mouth! That\u2019s some self control there. \n\nI read your update where you don\u2019t want to hurt your sil by cancelling. I\u2019d be less concerned with her and more about how this is going to affect your husband. \nI\u2019d be NC for life tbh", "Agree 100%. If you pay for the shower, he will continue to mistreat you. If you feel like you have to pay in order to have a relationship with SIL and baby, then it\u2019s a messed up relationship where they don\u2019t deserve you. Please don\u2019t pay for this shower. Help baby in other ways. Not this. Let him \u201cman up\u201d and do it himself.", "Right?? He also says that it feels good to be first for once. OP is the first born and the first to be pregnant. Her child would've been the first grandchild. He absolutely meant it as a shot against OP.", "Dont listen to them OP. They can do one on the cheap. It doesn\u2019t need to cost anything and they can stay within their means. I would not get involved.", "The baby shower does not need to be cancelled, your brother just needs to step up and pay for it \u2026 after all, doesn\u2019t he want to be the traditional bread winner for the family and be responsible for paying for things?", "What if you just made it a girls only baby shower? Or a shower for the mother to be and pamper her with a maternity massage or something like that?", "You owe that man nothing OP. HE was disrespectful. And I\u2019m guessing no one (including his wife) called him out on it. They see you as something they can use, not as a real person", "Another vote for \"cancel that shit\" but if you cannot/will no, scale it WAY back and find another way to spoil your SIL and the baby that doesn't benefit your AH brother.", "Still cancel. Everything else is giving doormat vibes. Stand up for yourself. \n\nI'm sorry you were treated that way. And believe ne, cancelling will not destroyed your relationship with the Baby or baby's momma.", "Right??? In working condition? Wtactualf! \n\nThat\u2019s a man who sees a woman as an object that he owns. He isn\u2019t just traditional in wanting to be a breadwinner. He sees his wife as breeding stock.\n\nNTA OP.", "[removed]", "I agree with this. Give your SIL something but not a baby shower.", "I like this. I\u2019ll add where I\u2019m from (Ireland) baby showers tend to be ladies only events.

And he does  not deserve any wins .\nNTA OP .\nMy condolences OP.\nMay joy surround you all of your days .", "They are, but hopefully at least some of her family are calling to see if she\u2019s OK.

My husband wasn't home but I invited them in for tea. I assumed they were there to pray for me or offer comfort. \n\nThey told me God was killing my babies because I wasn't a good enough Christian.
