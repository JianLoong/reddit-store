His dad has recently passed, and the home has to be split between him and his sister. This being their home for so many years, have opted to buy out the sisters cut so they can keep the home. There's only one problem, they supposedly can't get a loan to do so. \n\nHis mom was injured by her work and is currently waiting on a lawsuit. Her expected pay out is around 1 mil. Since she isn't working, she cannot get a loan. His step dad apparently has an issue where his job reported false income leading him to owe a large sum to the irs, unable to get a loan. His sister recently got her car repossessed, again unable to get a loan. \n\nHis mom wants him to take out a loan for them, and said she plans on paying it every month. His step dad has a large amount of money saved, and said they will pay off 4k my husband has in debt. I have 7k, but they haven't offered any help towards that. \n\nAs his wife I'm completely uncomfortable with the entire situation. We just had a baby and have a young child as well. In this economy any loans we get should be used to keep our own heads afloat. His mom told us when she gets her money she will gift him $100,000. Which I think is also why he feels compelled to help. But his mom opened a credit card unknowingly under his name 10 years ago. Her sister died and she had no money for her services. So she opened a card without my husband knowing, AND LET $7,000 GO TO COLLECTIONS. My husband paid off around $2,500 to get this debt off collections without her help. \n\nHe feels pressure to help his mom, but I say his own family comes first. When we were at her house and she first mentioned this, she even mentioned using our first time home buyer benefits, and even my husbands military va benefits. all it takes is his step dad losing his job, or for her to not win her settlement, and suddenly that payment is on my own family. There is no legal document binding them to paying back the loan. I feel like they are grown, and their problems are not MY families problems. I find it extremely inappropriate to ask your own child to do something like this when he has his own young family to care for and don't think my family should be pressured into doing something so serious.

Explain to him that he has been financially abused by his mother before, using emotionally manipulative behaviour to excuse it, (a funeral). Remind him that she never paid back the debt on it, leaving him to deal with it. Tell him that you support him as a wife, yet you need the same back - doing this would show that he does not value the security of his family with you and your child. You understand that it is hard to say no but he must stand firm, that it would not just be him suffering from their false promises.

And what happens when they can't pay the home loan?  His mom already committed fraud in his name and he was kind enough by repaying the debt.  I see a horrifying future where he has to pay their home loan because they can't/won't and then you and your husband will not have any way to purchase your own home.\n\nEven if his name is the only name on the title until they've repaid him in full, it's still problematic because he won't be able to evict them for non-payment as it's FAAAMily.\n\nIf they want to buy a home they can wait until the lawsuit is settled and they've built up a good credit score.  They are financially irresponsible and you shouldn't have to bear the burden of their bad choices.

I can't stress this enough: DO NOT DO THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.\nAlso I would lock down the credit for you, your husband and both kids and take every precaution to make sure that nobody other than yourselves can obtain debt in your name", "NTA, she is counting on money she does not and maybe will not have, what will happen ot you than.

Maybe they should have saved some  money during the 15 years they lived  rent free.\nMom is not guaranteed  a big win from the lawsuit. And it could take years\n\nIt would be a huge mistake  to take out this loan.", "NTA\u2026no, no and no.   As a previous mortgage loan processor, I have seen this situation go wrong more ways than it ever goes right.  There are so many legal issues in this scenario that I could not even mention them all.  Number one is this would affect your husbands credit and his debt to income ratio if you ever purchase a home.  (Do you pay a mortgage now or rent?).  Number two, if they do not pay, your husband will be responsible.  Plus, technically, they would be living in a home your husband legally owns.  Stay firm.  There is so much that could go wrong.

It's a good bet they didn't pay all the things they told you they paid for while living there.  They might have paid some utilities and possibly taxes here and there, but from your description of them it sounds more like they exaggerated their contributions. Having known people just like that I see the signs.  You and your husband are being gullible here. I think you see some red flags, but for some reason you believe a lot of what they say.  Do not ever believe their hard luck stories. Seriously. \n\nIf you didn't hear your MIL's attorney say these things about the suit, then I would take everything she says about money with a huge grain of salt.

Your husband did after it went to collections. \n\n I feel sorry for your husband, but he's being used.  It's not his job to take care of his mom and sister. They are adults.

Others have said that any money loaned to family or friends should be considered a gift. In this case, that would definitely be true, given their previous track record.

Identity theft?\n\nYeah, she is evil and it should be personal.", "I'm going to disagree with you here. Anyone who fraudulently opens a CC in their child's name and let's the charges go to collections trashing the child's credit, and the child has to pay it off without her help, that's evil. She may act nice, but she's morally corrupt.  All the best grifters are charming, kind. That's how they hoodwink people.  \n\nIn the years in between she never paid him back did she?\n\nShe's dishonest, a criminal.  She did this to her own child for pitys sake.  It's a hard truth your husband needs to face.  He can care for her and still  know she's not perfect and not allow himself to fall victim to her hard luck stories and dreams of riches. \n\nDo not allow this.  The only home loan you should apply for is for your own home. Do not get your finances entangled with theirs.  They have options.

The house itself is worth probably $450,000-480,000. So their payout to the sister would be around half of that! Mil is claiming she is waiting on her million dollars which is why she wants my husband to take out the loan to pay him back since no one in the household can get one.

We want to purchase our own home within a couple years, and this would affect it greatly :( it\u2019s a bold ask in my opinion!", "The only problem with this idea is that in the end it will be an expensive eviction of the parents.  Because they will never pay.  Better to just be a side-car to the eviction.", "It's a bad ask. \n\nI suppose your husband could agree to a loan if he was on the deed alone- which most mortgage providers would require that he at least be on the deed. And he could require Mom, Stepdad and sister to sign a lease that would cover mortgage, taxes, insurance with the property as a rental, and maintenance with an agreement that they can buy the house at any for the balance of the mortgage plus closing costs.\n\nAnd with a really clear- they have to pay the rent to you guys every month and if they don't, you guys would have no choice but to evict them- relatives or not. This is about you and your husband long term financial health.\n\nBut there is a reason everyone says don't rent to family. It rarely ends well.", "Cuz yeah, they've lived there 15 years rent free- they should be in a better place.\n\nAnd the idea that they're suddenly going to go from not paying rent to changing their spending habits enough to cover a mortgage plus all of the hidden costs associated with the house is crazy to me."]}
