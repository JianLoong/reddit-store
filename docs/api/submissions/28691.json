His dad has recently passed, and the home has to be split between him and his sister. This being their home for so many years, have opted to buy out the sisters cut so they can keep the home. There's only one problem, they supposedly can't get a loan to do so. \n\nHis mom was injured by her work and is currently waiting on a lawsuit. Her expected pay out is around 1 mil. Since she isn't working, she cannot get a loan. His step dad apparently has an issue where his job reported false income leading him to owe a large sum to the irs, unable to get a loan. His sister recently got her car repossessed, again unable to get a loan. \n\nHis mom wants him to take out a loan for them, and said she plans on paying it every month. His step dad has a large amount of money saved, and said they will pay off 4k my husband has in debt. I have 7k, but they haven't offered any help towards that. \n\nAs his wife I'm completely uncomfortable with the entire situation. We just had a baby and have a young child as well. In this economy any loans we get should be used to keep our own heads afloat. His mom told us when she gets her money she will gift him $100,000. Which I think is also why he feels compelled to help. But his mom opened a credit card unknowingly under his name 10 years ago. Her sister died and she had no money for her services. So she opened a card without my husband knowing, AND LET $7,000 GO TO COLLECTIONS. My husband paid off around $2,500 to get this debt off collections without her help. \n\nHe feels pressure to help his mom, but I say his own family comes first. When we were at her house and she first mentioned this, she even mentioned using our first time home buyer benefits, and even my husbands military va benefits. all it takes is his step dad losing his job, or for her to not win her settlement, and suddenly that payment is on my own family. There is no legal document binding them to paying back the loan. I feel like they are grown, and their problems are not MY families problems. I find it extremely inappropriate to ask your own child to do something like this when he has his own young family to care for and don't think my family should be pressured into doing something so serious.

Plus that no financial issue is ever THEIR fault (the stepdads IRS excuse made me laugh, tragic as it is)\n\nAs a lawyer, ANYTHING can happen with suits, nothing is guaranteed and that sort of payout is pretty rare (in my country anyway) this all sounds pretty fantastical\n\nIt\u2019s really easy to promise and give away money that doesn\u2019t actually exist. \n\nHold really strong here OP but also support your husband who is obviously conditioned to accept this kind of fuckery: it is you and him against this problem. \n\nHold strong, and keep vigilant so they don\u2019t try and pull moves against your property/finances. Make it clear you will not be responsible for their irresponsibility and you will press charges if they try it.\n\nEdit - NTA", "NTA - If they are just buying out the sisters half is there any reason why they need to do it so quickly? Is the sister trying to force the sale? It seems like if there isn't that sort of rush to just wait until her settlement and then buy her out", "NTA.   \n\n\nI have no idea whose tea his family peed in\u2026 but that\u2019s a LOT of financial woes across a LOT of adults all at once. And not just all at once\u2026 over decades they have had financial woes. Where was their saving of 15 years of rent? What is this nonsense about a credit card in your 19yr old son\u2019s name?   \n\n\nWhen she gets her payout\u2026 has the lawsuit even been settled yet? Or is it even in court? What about it is guaranteed to get $1m? Who says that? Is that before, or after the lawyers fees? Is she truthful? Well\u2026 her lying to get a credit card shows she isn\u2019t honest when she\u2019s desperate!\n\n  \nFalse reporting of income and a tax debt? Come on\u2026 step dad has seen his pay slip year on year on year\u2026 how much tax has he avoided paying and how long did he think this was going to go on for? He\u2019s a cheat.   \n\n\nSister can\u2019t keep up car payments.  \n\n\nClearly they have no money, and no ability to manage it when they do. \n\nThey\u2019ve completely effed over your husband\u2019s credit in the not distant enough past, and have zero credit capability of their own. Of course you shouldn\u2019t trust them.   \n\n\nIf you are outvoted somehow by your husband at least make it REALLY legally water tight. If the loan is in your name the land title is too. And if they are making payments there\u2019s a lease agreement and an impartial real estate agent managing the property. And the rent is market value, not some sweet heart deal. A $2m house is worth what in rent? Can they afford it?", "NTA. If he does it consider the money gone. I'd be willing to bet they wouldn't even make the first payment.", "NTA. Don't believe anything that she says. You are responsible for the safety and security of your children: make him understand that.", "NTA - he would be joining his family by doing so, as he would be risking the future of you and your child. It is also not his home to take a loan out on, it is *your shared home*, it is not his decision to solely make. Explain to him that he has been financially abused by his mother before, using emotionally manipulative behaviour to excuse it, (a funeral). Remind him that she never paid back the debt on it, leaving him to deal with it. Tell him that you support him as a wife, yet you need the same back - doing this would show that he does not value the security of his family with you and your child. You understand that it is hard to say no but he must stand firm, that it would not just be him suffering from their false promises. You already know the legal worthlessness of their \"promises\" for money to tell him. Your poor husband sounds like he has been conditioned to be mistreated by them, however, your empathy for this does not override your need to protect your family, (including him).", "NTA - but you need to die on this hill.  \nIf his mother doesn\u2019t pay the mortgage it won\u2019t only be his debt it will probably also be yours.  \nYou could lose everything.  \nYour family could end up homeless", "Don't do it. Don't give up his first time homebuyer status for them. Don't use up his VA entitlement for them... which would potentially be fraud anyway, he has to sign that he or his children or spouse would occupy the property.\n\nThree full grown adults have themselves in the situation. If she's so certain of the pending payout, it won't hurt them to rent somewhere else for a while until it comes in. \n\nIt is not a reasonable ask.", "NTA.  Goodness gracious. And what happens when they can't pay the home loan?  His mom already committed fraud in his name and he was kind enough by repaying the debt.  I see a horrifying future where he has to pay their home loan because they can't/won't and then you and your husband will not have any way to purchase your own home.\n\nEven if his name is the only name on the title until they've repaid him in full, it's still problematic because he won't be able to evict them for non-payment as it's FAAAMily.\n\nIf they want to buy a home they can wait until the lawsuit is settled and they've built up a good credit score.  They are financially irresponsible and you shouldn't have to bear the burden of their bad choices. They're going to continue being irresponsible because they get what they want without having to work for it. Again - NTA.", "\"When she gets the money she will repay OP\"  I very much doubt it, she will come up with some excuse not to pay.  Do not under any circumstances pay that loan.", "is written often in this sub: only lend as much as you are comfortable losing. and never give money to family for the same reason. NTA\n\nwhy dont they make that deal with the sisters? noone needs to take a loan if the stutter the money to the siblings instead of paying full. but i bet they know their brother to well for that", "NTA", "Do not back down, this is absolutely your hill to die on!\nI can only see all the ways this can go wrong and the dire consequences that will have for you and your husband. I can't stress this enough: DO NOT DO THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.\nAlso I would lock down the credit for you, your husband and both kids and take every precaution to make sure that nobody other than yourselves can obtain debt in your name", "NTA, she is counting on money she does not and maybe will not have, what will happen ot you than. With your debt who knows if you can get a loan, and you certainly cannot get a loan on a house that is not yours. They have shown they cannot manage money and do not pay things back, don't do it.", "NTA.    Maybe they should have saved some  money during the 15 years they lived  rent free.\nMom is not guaranteed  a big win from the lawsuit. And it could take years\n\nIt would be a huge mistake  to take out this loan.", "NTA\u2026no, no and no.   As a previous mortgage loan processor, I have seen this situation go wrong more ways than it ever goes right.  There are so many legal issues in this scenario that I could not even mention them all.  Number one is this would affect your husbands credit and his debt to income ratio if you ever purchase a home.  (Do you pay a mortgage now or rent?).  Number two, if they do not pay, your husband will be responsible.  Plus, technically, they would be living in a home your husband legally owns.  Stay firm.  There is so much that could go wrong.  His mother has already proven to be I trust worthy.  And she might never get a settlement t and if she ever dies, it could take years to do so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
