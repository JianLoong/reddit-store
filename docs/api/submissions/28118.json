It's just my tone had given off a vibe that was asking her to fuck off.\n\nI (18 M) was traveling on a train. There was hardly space for anyone to sit. A few stations later, when a couple of people had dropped off, there was breathing space, but there were no vacant seats left anyway. \n\nA pregnant woman entered the compartment and was apparently looking for a seat. Mine was the one which was immediately visible when she entered, and the people who had adjacent seats next to me were much older. \n\nI wasn't sure whether I should offer mine or not. I was just thinking through it when an old woman who was seated a little ahead asked her to take mine. She told the woman as in \"Take his seat there, there's enough space for you to sit.\"\n\nI didn't like that she was directly asking the woman to walk over and claim my seat, and I protested. I told her \"Hey, you can't just ask tell someone else to claim my seat. It's mine, I get to decide.\"\n\nShe asked me whether I couldn't see that she was pregnant, and that as a young man I had the ability to stand. Everyone was eyeing me as if I had said something wrong, but I got pissed off. I wasn't having that nonsense.\n\nI told her that I am not doing it, and she began to accuse me of not having respect for elders, etc. A few others asked me to give up mine too, but I didn't listen. I told the old woman that she has to mind her own business, to not interfere in my affairs, and that I have every right to remain there. She looked extremely cross and I probably came out with a bad impression on everyone, but I didn't like her attitude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696326044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ynd0f/aita_for_refusing_to_offer_my_seat_to_a_pregnant/", "score": 8809, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
