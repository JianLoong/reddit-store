It's just my tone had given off a vibe that was asking her to fuck off.\n\nI (18 M) was traveling on a train. There was hardly space for anyone to sit. A few stations later, when a couple of people had dropped off, there was breathing space, but there were no vacant seats left anyway. \n\nA pregnant woman entered the compartment and was apparently looking for a seat. Mine was the one which was immediately visible when she entered, and the people who had adjacent seats next to me were much older. \n\nI wasn't sure whether I should offer mine or not. I was just thinking through it when an old woman who was seated a little ahead asked her to take mine. She told the woman as in \"Take his seat there, there's enough space for you to sit.\"\n\nI didn't like that she was directly asking the woman to walk over and claim my seat, and I protested. I told her \"Hey, you can't just ask tell someone else to claim my seat. It's mine, I get to decide.\"\n\nShe asked me whether I couldn't see that she was pregnant, and that as a young man I had the ability to stand. Everyone was eyeing me as if I had said something wrong, but I got pissed off. I wasn't having that nonsense.\n\nI told her that I am not doing it, and she began to accuse me of not having respect for elders, etc. A few others asked me to give up mine too, but I didn't listen. I told the old woman that she has to mind her own business, to not interfere in my affairs, and that I have every right to remain there. She looked extremely cross and I probably came out with a bad impression on everyone, but I didn't like her attitude. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696326044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ynd0f/aita_for_refusing_to_offer_my_seat_to_a_pregnant/", "score": 1273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why're we assuming bad faith of this person?? There is no point in looking for something that isn't there, sometimes it is okay to take a comment at face value without tacking on the what ifs of other scenarios.", "It\u2019s not OP responsibility to give up his seat, it\u2019s a polite thing to do but he\u2019s no more of an AH than anyone else who didn\u2019t move. The only AH in this scenario was the demanding old woman.", "It would have been polite to move, but not moving isn\u2019t a AH move when nobody else is doing the same (especially when you specifically had been the only one to be called out). \n\nIf the elderly woman wasn\u2019t so entitled, I feel the OP would have moved out of courtesy", "Cons of keeping my account from middle school as an adult", "Doesn\u2019t mean she has to be a dick. I think you\u2019re missing that part.", "It's not only about needing a seat or not, it's about the damage potential of falling or hitting something of a pregnant woman or an elderly person. The worst that could happen to me is probably breaking a bone; the worst that could happen to a pregnant woman is miscarrying and dying.", "They don\u2019t have to say why, they could just say they have a disability and leave it at that. I\u2019m saying this as someone with a disability that is fully invisible, I\u2019ve sat on the floor in trains because I couldn\u2019t stand. I\u2019d rather let people know I have a medical issue than look like an asshole personally.", "I didn't say it was his responsibility. He can remain seated and be an AH just like any other able-bodied people who didn't offer. My issue is that he seemed to not give the seat to the pregnant woman to spite the old lady.", "Not being polite makes you an AH", "Other passengers requested for the OP specifically to move, they are the AHs. OP could have just verbally castigated the entitled woman while moving for the pregnant woman, but he\u2019s less of an AH than those who asked him to move while not doing so themselves.", "It would have been polite prior to the demands to move, OP was considering that. Once the demand was made, it becomes a matter of being a push over rather than one of politeness. \n\nThat being said, I do feel sorry for the pregnant woman, I\u2019m sure that she wouldn\u2019t have wanted any hostilities and arguments made on her behalf"]}
