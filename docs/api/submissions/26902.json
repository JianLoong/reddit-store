I was tired of being controlled by them for my entire life. For context, I've lived with my parents for my whole life but have never stood up to their rules. They've treated me like a child for my entire life. Before I moved out, at 17 I still had a bedtime, time limits on my phone and all technology confiscated at the end of every night, wasn't allowed anything with sugar in it unless I hid it in my room, stuff like that. A few years ago too, I had my first relationship ever when I was 16. We did long distance for the most part and only saw each other in summer. My parents hated him for no reason. They say it's because he didn't introduce himself to them but he only didn't because he was scared to say something wrong. For the next 2 years, my parents tried their damned hardest to make me end it with him. I loved him very much and he made me feel so happy. It crushed me that my parents were so hellbent on breaking us up. At one point, they took all my technology for a month so we couldn't talk at all. It made me so sad but we got through it. Most nights I would talk to them I'd end up calling him crying because my parents were yelling about how stupid I was and how much of a loser my boyfriend was. I tried to visit him twice but my parents shot down all attempts. \n\nWhen it came to finally be my 18th birthday, I hopped on a plane and went to see my boyfriend who I hadn't seen in months. Fast forward a few months and I moved in with him and his family. His mom is very caring and is helping me adult and figure out the things my parents didn't care to teach me about being an adult. I love all his siblings and we spend a lot of time together. I'm really happy here. My family on my dad's side supports me. My grandma told me how she saw how controlling my parents were but never said anything. My dad yells at her for having a relationship with me. Right now, I won't talk to them unless they admit to the hurt they've caused me. I know they were just trying to parent me the only way they knew how but it hurts they won't admit they've done anything wrong.

I have known so many parents like this and they tend to fail their children in multiple aspects to keep them dependent.", "There is likely some information missing but also there is enough to know the parents weren't good parents. \n\nBedtimes at 17 are incredibly unusual, at some point they should have removed the bedtimes and let their kid work out how to manage their own sleep. One of many lessons that should be learnt as a kid, not an adult. If a kid can't manage their own sleep by the age of 18 then the parents have done something wrong.", "Eh, I disagree. Bedtime at 17 is not unusual, in my experience. Dependent on when it is.\n\nWhen I was 17, I had to be in bed by 11. If my parents didn't enforce that, I'd probably end up staying up till like 2am every night. That's not my parents having done anything wrong, that's just me being a typical teenager and not caring about school and would rather play video games, etc.", "I think there is a lot of information missing.  You talk about cutting off the family on your moms side but don\u2019t say anything at all about your relationship and history with any of them.

Stay where you are.  Don't let them guilt you into coming back.", "There are 2 sides to every story and something tells me parents story may be way different.  That being said.  I hope you are not expecting your current situation to remain like this forever.  You are 18.  This is your first relationship.  Very likely it will not last.  I hope you have a plan b in place such as a job and higher education.  You may need it if you suddenly find yourself without a place to live.  I\u2019ve seen it happen, the family is so welcoming until something upsets their little boy and suddenly you are satans spawn.  Have a plan.", "I think you made the right choice. Your parents yelling at you and calling you stupid and your boyfriend a loser are definitely being abusive. You need time away to heal and learn to take care of yourself. Part of that is learning to stand up to people like your parents. There's lots out in the world so you'll get plenty of practice.\n\nI would also like to suggest you consider seeing a therapist to work through all that you grew up with. They can help you learn how to stand up for yourself and see yourself in a healthy way.", "The rules you describe are not so strange, at least not for me (at 17 I had a bedtime, rules about phone, Internet, candy, alcohol etc, they all disappearedat 18. Accordingto my mom, now was the time to show I learned from their parenting). It is your parents behaviour that makes you NTA. My mom always said to me, when you disagree with a boyfriend welcome them with open arms. It is the fastest way of getting them out of your child's live when they are bad news. Because only when people are welcoming to bad influences will you see the truth as fast as lightning. Your boyfriend was not bad news though, your parents were controlling in a different way.", "NTA.  Congratulations on your escape from Hell.", "nta, but theyre never going to realize they treated wrong. you will never get that magical moment where the person who fucked you over realizes it, feels remorse, and begs for forgiveness... and even if they did, what would it fix? \n\nit would be a good idea to cut them off. they cant control you or hurt you anymore. youre free now.", ">I know they were just trying to parent me the only way they knew how\n\n>My grandma told me how she saw how controlling my parents were but never said anything.\n\nNo?

Even your grandma knew they were controlling. They most likely knew of other ways but wanted to feel in control.", "NTA for cutting off controlling parents! I am so glad you are safe and in a good place with adultier adults who can help you figure out things. Maybe one day you can reestablish a relationship with them, with boundaries, IF you want. My partner and I both came from homes with big issues (mine were controlling, weirdo religious; theirs simply... didn't like them). We don't speak to either set of parents any more and just a few relatives who are supportive.

If I had parents like this I\u2019d make sure their elderly phase was equally restrictive and infantilizing.", "NTA. \n\nOne of the things that you will learn as you grow is that impact matters over intent.

I am just playing devil's advocate because you are 18 and in your first relationship and with your mindset, anything would seem better than being at your parent's home. I hate to say this, you sound like every girl who ended up pregnant right after high school and eventually single. Your parents may not be perfect, but at 18 you do not know best either. \n\nWhile you are living your best life with your boyfriend (who I would never let my underage kid get on a plane and visit someone and I think that is just a reasonable approach most parents have), maybe use the distance between you and your parents to attempt to repair the relationship and understand their POV, so at least you can be cordial with them. You may need them soon enough.", "Info: how old is your boyfriend and how old was he when he started talking to you. If same age as you NTA.

Definitely NTA. And I'm happy you found support. Wishing you the best going forward.", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately your parents probably won't ever admit fault. You gotta either learn to forgive and be ok with that or, be okay with the fact you will probably be LC or NC with them for the rest of your life.\n\nWaiting on them to change is just gonna hurt you more in the long run. So make plans and act with that in mind.\n\nI am sorry, that is a rotten position to be in, and I hope against the odds they do learn, change and, apologize for your sake.
