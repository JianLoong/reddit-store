She thinks I'm the coolest person on earth or something like that. She is always copying me. When we go out she wants to twin with me. She is also very similar to me in every way, both in looks and taste. She likes the same music and tv shows that I do, has the same hobbies etc.\n\nSo I've been back home for summer for a few days now and Karina has so many activities planned for the both of us and she is so excited to do them with me. From going to restaurants and cafes together to binge watching our favorite tv shows and cooking together.\n\nThe problem is none of these activities involve Melody as Karina doesn't like her that much.\n\nAlso Melody doesn't have the same taste as us so every time we take her somewhere with us, we have nothing to talk about.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are insisting that we should involve Melody and they think I'm an asshole for only doing things with Karina and excluding Melody like this.\n\nHowever I think I should be allowed to spend time with my sister without Melody. I know she is my stepsister but I was never really close to her and don't really see her as my sister and Karina doesn't want Melody to come with us but now I feel bad because I feel like maybe I'm being a bit mean to a little kid but this is the only time of year that I get to spend time with my baby sister and I want us to enjoy it", "created_utc": 1688741663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t9j2o/aita_for_excluding_my_stepsister/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course having a special relationship with Karina should be allowable - you can bond and spend time doing certain things you share. But honestly doing this repeatedly or as a rule and routinely excluding Melody is unfair and harmful. Honestly like, I get that you have sooo much in common with Karina but frankly, you're an adult and can make conversation with someone you don't have as much in common with - like learn about her interests, see what makes her tick. I know family dynamics, especially in a step / half situation, is complex but I don't see why Melody should get the short end of the stick here.  \n\n\nEdit: So yes, YWBTA if you proceed with this plan. Be the mature one.", "Soft YTA - Unfortunately, you're the grown up here and your siblings are not. As such, you're kinda the one who needs to try and help include both of them. Maybe let Melody suggest an activity or two for you to all do together. You may even enjoy yourself, but at the very least it will be clear that you are making an effort to include both of them.", "Info: Is Karina also Melody's half sister? If she is, I'm assuming that mean's Melody has been around for a minimum of 10 years (given Karina's age). If not, how long has she been in the picture? You do say you were never really close to her, so it gives the impression of her being in the picture for a while.\n\nI think YTA either way but the answer to my request for info changes the degree.\n\nIn the case that Melody is also Karina's half sister and has been around for 10+ years, you're a massive asshole. That girl would know no other family than what you guys have (depending on the whole which parent she's tied to and if the other is in the picture or not). And You are excluding her and it's not fair. Being the child on the outside and left out is so extremely hard. And you're causing emotional/mental trauma by actively excluding her. She's your family whether you like it or not. And you should make more of an effort AND set an example for your younger sister. You don't have to do EVERYTHING with her. But you could at least make an effort.\n\nIn the case that it's not a shared half sister thing, the reason you're still an asshole is what you pointed out. She's just a kid. And for all the same reasons I pointed out previously, you're alienating her in her own family. You should be trying to make an effort and encourage them to find ways to bond since they have to live together. And again, she's part of your family now whether you like it or not. That girl is a kid, and doesn't deserve to be treated like a pariah. \n\nAll in all, regardless, she's a kid. Who likely ask to be in this situation anymore than you and your little sister did. But she doesn't deserve to be alienated. You and your sister are being exceedingly selfish. You don't care about her at all. And while your sister is a child who gets only a minor pass because you're encouraging the behavior, you are an adult. You know better. Everything you've said says you know better.", "YTA for excluding a thirteen year old from family activities. You're the adult here. If the angsty teen seems withdrawn and standoffish, utlize the social skills that you've developed over the past 10 years to draw them out of their shell.  As long as you keep excluding her from activities, you will continue to have nothing to talk about with her.", "NTA", "NTA. But are they okay with you doing some things that include her and others that don't? Also, does Melody even want to go everywhere with you? That could sway my judgement.", "Yta So much for leading by example", "YTA\n\nIt would be considerate to make some time for your stepsister. You're allowing Karina to be your excuse to not do that because you like being the hero.", "YTA - look you can do activities with just Karina but at least do some stuff with just melody too rather than completely excluding her", "YTA. She's 13 and is VERY LIKELY picking up on the energy of both of you not wanting her around. I am also sure she knows she doesn't have anything in common with you both either. Nonetheless, she IS a part of the very same family you all are. Excluding her intentionally is mean girl behavior & just not cool at all. You're supposed to be the adult here, but you're behaving like the 'little kid'. Smh. I cannot imagine mistreating a child because we have nothing in common. Find common ground, ask her what she likes, make room for your stepsister, go to a movie you all can agree on - like how hard is that (?), get to know her, show her you can compromise as an adult woman. Yes, spend time with your little sister, but also be a decent human being and don't intentionally exclude children from outings under the very fake guise of needing quality time. Do you want your little sister to grow up following your example of excluding people for their difference??", "INFO: do you make any effort to spend to spend one on one time with your stepsister?", "NTA. Until the day you both feel the relationship and call each other sister then Melody is nothing more than your mother\u2019s husband\u2019s child and Not your sister.

And when she\u2019s made suggestions it not something you and Karina have any interest in or would find worth doing. That\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, you are simply not compatible people.\n\nHonestly from how much your mom is pushing it, it sounds like the reason Karina hero worships you is because you put Her first and Not forcing her to either constantly compromise or simply have to take a backseat.", "YTA\n\nFind some way to include them both. They are both your sisters.\n\nI love my step brother but that took a lot of work and willingness to sacrifice on both parties.", "NTA. Maybe include her on one outing. But, ultimately it\u2019s your choice. I don\u2019t know why people are trying to force you to have a relationship with her. \n\nMy guess is there\u2019s a much larger backstory going on.", "YTA\n\nShe is a 13 year old girl. If you were 10 like your half-sister, then I would understand your reasons. However, you're 23, and obviously, your half-sister will follow whatever behaviors you exhibit. If you don't include Melanie, then it just sets a precedent for Karina to ignore her. I don't think it will be torture if you attempt to include her in activities. Show some compassion for a little girl who just wants to fit in with her family.", "YTA - you can have different relationships with them but youre the adult here. If Karina is feeling left out you should probably find some way to include her in somethings or somehow. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest it kind of sounds like you just want the attention from Melody because saying you dont view one of the two as a step sister is a little cold.", "NTA", "YTA - she is a child. Maybe try to get to know her. You don't have to do everything with her but fully excluding her? no.", "YTA. You don\u2019t use a sisterly relationship with her, but you could if you wanted to. She\u2019s 13, make an effort, it\u2019ll probably pay off for both of you if you do.", "INFO: does Melody even want to be included? Sounds like she has gone with you guys before. I think it would be good if you included her sometimes, but parents forcing it isn't the way..", "NTA. You should be able to spend time with just your own sister.", "NTA. You and your sister want to spend time with each other and have a right to do so.", "NTA.    You are \ud83d\udcaf right in this.  Melody is not your sibling and you have nothing in common.  So sad your mom cares more about keeping hubby and SD happy than caring for your relationship.   Melody has the fall, winter and spring to make a relationship with Karina and apparently doesn\u2019t do so.  That is on them and their parents.", "YTA and acting like a child.", "NAH? I can totally understand your point of view because your stepsister isn't even really your family member and if Karina dislikes her, it'll ruin the vibe, but I can also understand how Melody may feel because when people don't invite me anywhere just bcz they think I won't like it, I feel a little sad that they didn't even attempt to ask.\n\nEdit: From reading your comments, it seems like you don't like Melody either... Like turning down her suggestions and stuff because it's boring to you. So, I'm leaning a little towards YTA.", "Of course you can spend time with Karina without Melody. But that doesn't have to and shouldn't be all the time. You can do things Melody likes sometimes, too, even if it's not exactly to your tastes.
