She thinks I'm the coolest person on earth or something like that. She is always copying me. When we go out she wants to twin with me. She is also very similar to me in every way, both in looks and taste. She likes the same music and tv shows that I do, has the same hobbies etc.\n\nSo I've been back home for summer for a few days now and Karina has so many activities planned for the both of us and she is so excited to do them with me. From going to restaurants and cafes together to binge watching our favorite tv shows and cooking together.\n\nThe problem is none of these activities involve Melody as Karina doesn't like her that much.\n\nAlso Melody doesn't have the same taste as us so every time we take her somewhere with us, we have nothing to talk about.\n\nMy mom and stepdad are insisting that we should involve Melody and they think I'm an asshole for only doing things with Karina and excluding Melody like this.\n\nHowever I think I should be allowed to spend time with my sister without Melody. I know she is my stepsister but I was never really close to her and don't really see her as my sister and Karina doesn't want Melody to come with us but now I feel bad because I feel like maybe I'm being a bit mean to a little kid but this is the only time of year that I get to spend time with my baby sister and I want us to enjoy it", "created_utc": 1688741663, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t9j2o/aita_for_excluding_my_stepsister/", "score": 522, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course having a special relationship with Karina should be allowable - you can bond and spend time doing certain things you share. But honestly doing this repeatedly or as a rule and routinely excluding Melody is unfair and harmful. Honestly like, I get that you have sooo much in common with Karina but frankly, you're an adult and can make conversation with someone you don't have as much in common with - like learn about her interests, see what makes her tick. I know family dynamics, especially in a step / half situation, is complex but I don't see why Melody should get the short end of the stick here.  \n\n\nEdit: So yes, YWBTA if you proceed with this plan. Be the mature one.", "Soft YTA - Unfortunately, you're the grown up here and your siblings are not. As such, you're kinda the one who needs to try and help include both of them. Maybe let Melody suggest an activity or two for you to all do together. You may even enjoy yourself, but at the very least it will be clear that you are making an effort to include both of them.", "Info: Is Karina also Melody's half sister? If she is, I'm assuming that mean's Melody has been around for a minimum of 10 years (given Karina's age). If not, how long has she been in the picture? You do say you were never really close to her, so it gives the impression of her being in the picture for a while.\n\nI think YTA either way but the answer to my request for info changes the degree.\n\nIn the case that Melody is also Karina's half sister and has been around for 10+ years, you're a massive asshole. That girl would know no other family than what you guys have (depending on the whole which parent she's tied to and if the other is in the picture or not). And You are excluding her and it's not fair. Being the child on the outside and left out is so extremely hard. And you're causing emotional/mental trauma by actively excluding her. She's your family whether you like it or not. And you should make more of an effort AND set an example for your younger sister. You don't have to do EVERYTHING with her. But you could at least make an effort.\n\nIn the case that it's not a shared half sister thing, the reason you're still an asshole is what you pointed out. She's just a kid. And for all the same reasons I pointed out previously, you're alienating her in her own family. You should be trying to make an effort and encourage them to find ways to bond since they have to live together. And again, she's part of your family now whether you like it or not. That girl is a kid, and doesn't deserve to be treated like a pariah. \n\nAll in all, regardless, she's a kid. Who likely ask to be in this situation anymore than you and your little sister did. But she doesn't deserve to be alienated. You and your sister are being exceedingly selfish. You don't care about her at all. And while your sister is a child who gets only a minor pass because you're encouraging the behavior, you are an adult. You know better. Everything you've said says you know better.", "YTA for excluding a thirteen year old from family activities. You're the adult here. If the angsty teen seems withdrawn and standoffish, utlize the social skills that you've developed over the past 10 years to draw them out of their shell.  As long as you keep excluding her from activities, you will continue to have nothing to talk about with her.", "NTA", "NTA. But are they okay with you doing some things that include her and others that don't? Also, does Melody even want to go everywhere with you? That could sway my judgement.", "Yta So much for leading by example", "YTA\n\nIt would be considerate to make some time for your stepsister. You're allowing Karina to be your excuse to not do that because you like being the hero.", "YTA - look you can do activities with just Karina but at least do some stuff with just melody too rather than completely excluding her", "YTA. She's 13 and is VERY LIKELY picking up on the energy of both of you not wanting her around. I am also sure she knows she doesn't have anything in common with you both either. Nonetheless, she IS a part of the very same family you all are. Excluding her intentionally is mean girl behavior & just not cool at all. You're supposed to be the adult here, but you're behaving like the 'little kid'. Smh. I cannot imagine mistreating a child because we have nothing in common. Find common ground, ask her what she likes, make room for your stepsister, go to a movie you all can agree on - like how hard is that (?), get to know her, show her you can compromise as an adult woman. Yes, spend time with your little sister, but also be a decent human being and don't intentionally exclude children from outings under the very fake guise of needing quality time. Do you want your little sister to grow up following your example of excluding people for their difference??", "INFO: do you make any effort to spend to spend one on one time with your stepsister?", "NTA. Until the day you both feel the relationship and call each other sister then Melody is nothing more than your mother\u2019s husband\u2019s child and Not your sister.

And when she\u2019s made suggestions it not something you and Karina have any interest in or would find worth doing. That\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, you are simply not compatible people.\n\nHonestly from how much your mom is pushing it, it sounds like the reason Karina hero worships you is because you put Her first and Not forcing her to either constantly compromise or simply have to take a backseat.", "YTA\n\nFind some way to include them both. They are both your sisters.\n\nI love my step brother but that took a lot of work and willingness to sacrifice on both parties.", "NTA. Maybe include her on one outing. But, ultimately it\u2019s your choice. I don\u2019t know why people are trying to force you to have a relationship with her. \n\nMy guess is there\u2019s a much larger backstory going on.", "YTA\n\nShe is a 13 year old girl. If you were 10 like your half-sister, then I would understand your reasons. However, you're 23, and obviously, your half-sister will follow whatever behaviors you exhibit. If you don't include Melanie, then it just sets a precedent for Karina to ignore her. I don't think it will be torture if you attempt to include her in activities. Show some compassion for a little girl who just wants to fit in with her family.", "YTA - you can have different relationships with them but youre the adult here. If Karina is feeling left out you should probably find some way to include her in somethings or somehow. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest it kind of sounds like you just want the attention from Melody because saying you dont view one of the two as a step sister is a little cold.", "NTA", "YTA - she is a child. Maybe try to get to know her. You don't have to do everything with her but fully excluding her? no.", "YTA. You don\u2019t use a sisterly relationship with her, but you could if you wanted to. She\u2019s 13, make an effort, it\u2019ll probably pay off for both of you if you do.", "INFO: does Melody even want to be included? Sounds like she has gone with you guys before. I think it would be good if you included her sometimes, but parents forcing it isn't the way..", "NTA. You should be able to spend time with just your own sister.", "NTA. You and your sister want to spend time with each other and have a right to do so.", "NTA.    You are \ud83d\udcaf right in this.  Melody is not your sibling and you have nothing in common.  So sad your mom cares more about keeping hubby and SD happy than caring for your relationship.   Melody has the fall, winter and spring to make a relationship with Karina and apparently doesn\u2019t do so.  That is on them and their parents.", "YTA and acting like a child.", "NAH? I can totally understand your point of view because your stepsister isn't even really your family member and if Karina dislikes her, it'll ruin the vibe, but I can also understand how Melody may feel because when people don't invite me anywhere just bcz they think I won't like it, I feel a little sad that they didn't even attempt to ask.\n\nEdit: From reading your comments, it seems like you don't like Melody either... Like turning down her suggestions and stuff because it's boring to you. So, I'm leaning a little towards YTA.", "Of course you can spend time with Karina without Melody. But that doesn't have to and shouldn't be all the time. You can do things Melody likes sometimes, too, even if it's not exactly to your tastes.

Was in a somewhat similar situation to you. Three siblings (me, step sibling and youngest half sibling) all of the same gender with an altogether age difference of 8 years. Due to a toxic sitution with my custodial parent I moved in full time in my late teens. Me and my YS looked a lot alike as well but while I was the somewhat cool sibling I did my fair share of care. Both me and middle sibling when Step and actual parent were at work would keep a general eye on YS, MS on Saturdays and me on Sundays. SP once tried to hold an intervention feeling that I was favoring YS too much but that was cut short by MS who insisted that Sundays (if there were no family plans) were her day to not be at college or be in charge of YS.  I worked Saturdays so on Sundays would often take YS to either early morning swim sessions or to the early Sunday cinema viewings giving everyone else a chance of a late lazy morning. Would never dreamed of freezing out MS like Melody has been. Both SP and AP would of never of allowed it to happen. While me and MS rarely got one on one bonding time we would still hang out and make time for all of us.  A family is a unit so your parents might want some actual bonding time as well. You can get craft sets rather cheaply and craft books from the library are free (ie origami). Make up some popcorn, cheesy nachos, mix up some drinks (lemonade with fruit juice/squash) and watch some family favorite films together. I fondly recall visits to the park and impromptu picnics (rotisserie chicken, baguette, crisps and soft drinks). Fingers were used. Wet wipes used to clean hands before and after. Napkins were plates. Go to the free local museums together. Have either of your siblings put together an afternoon tea or had scones with clotted cream and jam. Wooden model kits are a fantastic person bonding activity. Ask Melody is there anything she would really like to do. You are a grown adult.

You are the adult, use your fucking brain and think of how shitty that must feel inside.", "It\u2019s easy to have the same taste as a 10 yr old when your post is fake lol", "That\u2019s your fault. Everything here reads like you were a a pissed off child when your parent brought in a step parent with a child. You have been her family as long as she can remember and you are being the \u201cdifficult step sister\u201d in this relationship.", "this would be enough to justify not taking them out together, but i still think you should spend at least a little bit of one on one time with melody, even if it\u2019s sitting through a show you think is boring for a couple hours", "op isn't melodies sister just because her mom married her dad. legally yes but thatv doesn't meann she has to have. a relationship with melody. she does t view her as a sister which is her right.", "Do we know when stepsister entered OPs life tho? I don\u2019t find the halfsister\u2019s age relevant to that question. The half sister can be 10 and the stepsister could\u2019ve shown up a year ago. We don\u2019t know", "from context provided in OPs comments, it sounds as if she's known and grown up around her since she was a toddler... so she's not just some random girl. She has been apart of the family for a long time. \n\nYTA, please reconsider how you perceive your relationships with family, and think about how you would feel if roles were reversed and karina adored melody as her big sister...", "They\u2019ve been a family for 10 fucking years. OP isn\u2019t 15 she\u2019s 23. I also have step siblings and half siblings but I know better than to exclude them. In fact, we have a very good relationship now just because we treated each other like FAMILY", "I mean, without any further explanation, half-sister would suppose that the stepdad is the father, and thus he and the mom would have been together for at least the time of conception of the half-sister. Of course, that could not be the case, but it\u2019s a fair assumption. \n\nThat means at least 10 years of stepsister. (However, with the difference in relationship, one could also think that the half-sister isn\u2019t a child of the stepdad.)", "I think it's pretty clear that the parents ensure that both Melody and Karina are treated equally at home and both are very much part of the family, which is why they don't want OP coming in and lavishing love and attention on 1 of their children whilst very pointedly excluding the other one. Behaviour like that directed towards a child can do long term psychological damage and I 100% agree with the parents that what OP is doing is unacceptable.", "I mean, if you would like to be mean and delusional, that's your business. But I would pick a struggle.", "Melody is Karina\u2019s half sister too.", "its the other way around", "God forbid the 10 year old suggests doing something that OP doesn't like. OP will just cut her out of her life when that day comes.", "Right, sorry! But still not both steps.", "OP, I was the little sister who was intentionally left out of everything, partly bc I didn\u2019t have much in common with my sisters and mostly because one of them hated my mom (their stepmom) and me by extension. It hurts, deep, and it doesn\u2019t stop as you get older. Even though my sisters and I are on better terms now, I still don\u2019t consider either of them close family because I\u2019m afraid to even try to build a relationship with them after over 2 decades of rejection. You have the opportunity to spare Melody that by just trying to get to know her.", "So you didn't like it that your mom got married to someone not your dad and blamed his daughter.  You were mean to her growing up and your (and her!) sister picked up on it and imitates you.  YTA.", "It's pretty simple.  Op isn't interested in doing what step sister wants.  If step sister wants to be included, then she goes with them on what they want to do and doesn't fight or argue with op's sister during the outings.  Sounds like she's had the chance to be included, and ruined it.", "No prob, English is my only language, and I mostly suck at it, you're all good!", "> Op isn't interested in doing what step sister wants.\n\nOP is the ADULT here. ADULTS need to make allowances for CHILDREN. I don't want to watch Tinkerbell for the 5th time with my nieces. I'd rather we watched the football. But I let them choose since I am the ADULT in this situation.\n\nOP is basically excluding a 13 year old CHILD because OP refuses to do anything that the 13 year old CHILD wants to do. The CHILD'S choice is either to do something she doesn't want to do or to not do anything. Any reasonable ADULT in this situation would let the 2 CHILDREN take it in turns picking what they want to do to make things fair for both CHILDREN. Instead, OP is doing things that one CHILD wants to do since they like what that child likes, and is excluding the other CHILD simple because they don't want to do what that CHILD likes. \n\nI have capitalised who is a child and who is an adult in this scenario, because some people really seem to be struggling to grasp it.", "Everyone knows who the ADULT and CHILD are, but it doesn't matter. OP just doesn't care about the step sister. Your whole example with you and your nieces is because you want a relationship with them, but OP just doesn't give a fuck. \n\nSucks for the step sister but as the other person said, that's life. Not everyone around you will love you or want to spend time with you. Maybe OP will regret it one day, maybe her parents will teach her that they don't have to do shit for OP either. But at the end of the day it's OP's choice and it's a valid (albeit shitty) choice.", "No, they actually do not.   If step sister really wants to be included in their plans (note...included means doing those plans, not vetoing them) she can be.  She does what was planned and she doesn't fight/argue.   It's on her.", "YTA", "Yta a little. I understand what it is like to have an older sister like Karina, as my half sister is 12 years older than me. You dont have alot in common, she idolizes you because of your age. \n\nMelody is not a random kid- she is also your sisters sister and your step sister. It sounds like you may have never had interest because she nits your sister and the age difference, but to her view, she probably sees you as a sister. \n\nHer and Karina are sisters that are growing up together and Karina having an older sister that is interested in her but Melody is rejected by can be tough, especially those years. And no matter the relation of her parent to yours, she will always be karinas sister. \n\nHow Karina feels about both of you will change, as one day she wont idolize you. As that is part of growing up. And she may feel closer to and not fight with melody. She may be closer to melody than you in the future. \n\nYou are young and still maturing. Your sister and step sister are still young and figuring out what they like. Your parent has practically been a parent to your step sister her entire life. She will probably be involved for all important events related to your parent and sister. So it wouldnt be a bad idea to try bonding more. \n\nI would imagine that there is something the three of you could all enjoy. I think it would be kind to have some time with all of karinas sisters but also have just you and karina time. \n\nAnd talk to melody about her specific behavior when together using I statements. As her being kind to Karina would need to be part of the deal.", "Can you plan some activities together and some alone? \n\nI had stepsisters from age 4-12 and lived with them between ages 10-12.

YTA", "I think you mistyped 13 as 23 because there is absolutely no way you are acting like this at your big age toward a child you've known for a minimum of 10 years. \n\nYTA, without a shadow of a doubt. No one is saying be best friends and love her as you do the 10 y.o (which, btw, it's mega weird to have had issues with a literal toddler and maintain that problem for 10 years) but to be mature and kind about how you interact with her. Find ways to include her, learn the definition of compromise, as adults should typically know how to do by 23 to some extent, and plan something that can be a thing for the three of you, or at least you and her.", "No matter how you and your sister feel about her, what you are doing is very hurtful to melody", "Are you actually Karina? Because this post and your comments do not sound remotely like they've been written by a 23yo. \n\nAnyway, YTA.", "Yes, this. You can do things with both individually. Things based upon their likes.

I felt less loved, less than and unwanted.", "You get the choice to be Homelander or Superman as a hero.", "Absolutely right.

She would also be your half sisters half sister. It seems pretty mean to exclude her from everything  all summer because she is not \u201cblood related\u201d to you, although she is that to Karina . Is it because she doesn\u2019t hero worship you?  I guarantee that when your half sister is a teen she won\u2019t be your mini-me either. This has real mean girl, exclusionary vibes. Think about what you , as an adult, are teaching children on how to treat others.  Surely you have some activities you can do together ie going for ice cream, seeing a movie, going swimming or shopping. If it\u2019s a special hobby that Melody isn\u2019t interested in that\u2019s different, but leaving one sister out of everything all summer does mean.
