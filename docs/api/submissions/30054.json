I definitely have felt the need to apologize for some of their more insensitive habits and behaviors. The last time we went to a decent Mexican restaurant, I had to apologize multiple times because they kept confusing patrons with staff and didn't really bother to tell the difference. \n\nI've also been on the other side of this exact interaction. I grew up in California, and whenever my family would visit San Francisco, we got stopped multiple times by people asking where Chinatown was. Even when we were on the opposite side of the city. Even when we were out-of-town tourists riding on the same tour bus. It is very tiresome.\n\nA number of posts here are saying 'there's nothing wrong with asking a random person directions', and I think that's kind of missing the point. It's like asking a random person in a Target for directions because they were wearing a red shirt (also a thing I have been on the receiving end of). \n\nThe fundamental issue is not the asking, it's the unwillingness to see people as more than their most obvious physical characteristics. In that interaction, your dad clearly saw them as 'Asian' more than they saw them as a person and calling them out on that is the right thing to do. It's something I have had to do more than once, and it is something that everyone with rude parents should do.", "NTA\n\nAlso, the assumption that all, or even most, Chinese people in NYC live in Chinatown is just stupid.", "NTA. Your dad sought someone out based on how they look to make assumptions about what they know. He doubled down when confronted. I don't know how people are saying you're the asshole here. You're aware of your dad's intentions behind the question and called him out on them, good on you.", "Given your replies in the comments, NTA. Your dad is clearly a racist.", "Hahaha this is classic Indian dad energy.  My dad still does stuff like this \"Chinese eat at Chinese restaurants and Indians eat in Indian restaurants.  Why are we in a Thai restaurant?\"\n\nNAH.  Like he asked someone for directions but for racist reasons.  You didn't need to apologize to them but you correcting your dad is fine (if somewhat futile if you're dad is anything like my parents).  They just don't have any concept of desegregation.  I had to drill it into mine (married a white girl and that fixed it real quick).", "NTA. You're not responsible for your dad being a racist asshole. Good on you for saying something to the guy.", "Yeah, kinda YTA.\n\nWhy? Because your dad wasn't being that. People ask a random person on the street for directions. I got asked for directions in NYC and I was a tourist. I took it as a compliment that someone counted on me.\n\nThe guy could've been annoyed because he didn't want to be bothered. (I was nice about it fwiw and felt bad I couldn't help them. I think I directed them to somewhere to ask.)  \n\n\nIf someone asks for help that's a vote of confidence in your knowledge, it's not presuming anything. And any New Yorker might know where any part of the city is or they might not. It's not a r-ist presumption.", "NTA. I would have done what you did, apologize to the man and then explain to my father why I did that.\n\nBut the people calling your father a racist asshole are being ridiculous. And they're trivializing actual racist assholery.", "YTA - Your dad asked someone where something was oh no!", "NAH. I'm not sure what kind of person your father is overall but if you were around Canal St. in NYC and you asked an Asian where Chinatown is, they might brush you off only because it might be a ridiculous statement to hear \\[the neighborhood is visibly very \"Chinese immigrant\". Not a whole lot of non-Chinese Asians in that area aside from the random Viet, so I doubt what he did came off as racist to anyone.", "ESH.\n\nYour dad's comment to you was racist.  You calling a person in NYC a \"random Asian\" is also racist.\n\nYour dad asking a \\*person\\* in NYC, which way is Chinatown, is not racist.  New Yorkers are generally annoyed at all tourists asking questions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their sense of humour? I'm tall, little old ladies constantly ask me to help them get something from the high shelf in stores. It'd be absolutely mental to call them out on \"clearly seeing me as tall more than they see me as a person\". People do stuff like this in all sorts of situations - they use your \"most obvious physical characteristic\" to determine how like you are to be able to help them.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "Damn, Indian dads in my area must be different. \n\nMost will tell me & my friends, \"we are Indian, why would we go to an Indian restaurant instead of home?! We are in America, we need to go to Thai and Italian restaurants instead!\"", "but when I misunderstood and confronted my dad , he replied with \"all Chinese ppl only live in chinatown and since chinatown was near, he must be Chinese and must live there\"", "This is possibly the least thought-out judgment I've come across. Obviously when OP said 'random asian' he meant it in the context of his dad assuming a random asian would know where chinatown is, as confirmed by his dad saying \"what are u blabbering? all Chinese would obviously live in Chinatown, stop being an AH\". So no, OP was not being racist to say that, and your judgment is horrendously bad.", "What a weird comparison.  Your tallness speaks directly to your ability to reach high shelves.  Someone's \"Asianness\" does not inform their ability to know where Chinatown is.", "You make a good point. It is reasonable in some situations to observe the physical traits of others and ignoring that would be strange. To borrow your example, I wouldn't ask someone shorter than me to reach a high shelf.\n\nHowever, I think that ignores the context of this post. Connecting \"tall person\" to \"high shelves\" is more reasonable and less ignorant/racist than connecting \"Asian person\" to \"definitely knows where Chinatown is\". Suggesting that they are the same thing seems a bit of a stretch to me.\n\nI appreciate your input, and I think it is valuable, since indeed, being aware of others physical traits is unavoidable. But I think that the assumptions people make based on someone's height are very different from the assumptions people make based on race and cultural background. Perhaps instead of \"physical characteristics\" I should have simply said \"race\" or \"ethnicity\".", "It's such a bimodal distribution right?  I mean I am of dad age and am immigrant Indian and I definitely say that.  Like...  I'm a reaally really good cook and can make a onam feast or kalyana saapaddu at home so I don't go spend $20 on bhindi masala and garlic naan.  But my dad (born in the 50s) still very much has the British India era mentality of \"Brahmins eat at brahmin veg restaurants, white people eat at white people restaurants, chinese eat at chinese and never shall they ever meet.\"", "Yes, that part definitely sucks. But simply asking someone where Chinatown is isn't inherently racist.", "But that was AFTER you apologized.", "Solid aristotelian syllogism...", "That was not in the OP.\n\nYeah that is at least a misapprehension on his part.\n\nHowever still not R-ist, because that word means believing in superiority and/or inferiority based on R. I don't see anything like *that* in anything you've quoted.", ">all Chinese ppl only\n\nAre you sure he said **all** and **only**? (Edit: I asked because sometimes memory isn't reliable, and emotions can hear things differently.)\n\nSounds like he assumed he might live in the neighborhood because it was near.\n\nEdit: got a down boop but the comment *literally* said:  \n\n\n\\> since chinatown was near, he must be Chinese and must live there", "I stand by my judgment.  People are not \"random\" just because they are strangers.  And it's wrong to assume a person identifies with any particular ethnicity or race, based on their appearance.  \n\nThat applies as much to OP for assuming the person would be offended as it does to the dad for assuming they would know where Chinatown is.", "Yeah, its quite funny, my grandma was very much the way you described, whenever she visited.\n\nI guess my parents moved to the US in the 80s, and according to them, hadnt even seen a burrito before lol. So they just jumped at everything they saw.", "yea which confirmed the reason OP needed to apologize", "I moved here in the 2000s and hadn't ever had a burrito (or anything other than Indian food except for pizza).  I lived off of quesadillas and tacos my whole freshman year.  So yes - I was your parents in this case...  \"GIMME ALL OF THE FOODS!  HOW DO I SAY TO GO IN SPANISH?\""]}
