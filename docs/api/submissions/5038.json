Yes he is in a day hours special Ed program im talking about when he's home. She has a bad back (scoliosis and ruptured disc, part of which happened with caring for our son because he's so strong). She is completely overwhelmed and we cannot have respite workers because if anyone my son is not familiar with is in the house he has an extreme meltdown. We are planning on placing him in a group home but unfortunately the waitlist is miles long they're estimating about 18 months-2 years. \n\nWhen I'm home I'm completely hands on, but I have to work long hours and some weekends to make ends meet and unfortunately my son requires 110% of my wife's attention and it's harder due to her back, so we really need our 12 year olds help with her 4 year old sister. And because he is a horrible sleeper wife and I are both badly sleep deprived, this sleep deprivation is only supposed to happen in infancy. Yesterday I had to work all day and she decided to lock herself in her room refusing to come out and help out, due to the tension she caused my son had an inconsolable meltdown and my 4 yr old was crying due to fear and wanting attention. \n\nI grounded her until Xmas. I told her I realize the situation is not ideal and she shouldn't have to go through this, but she needs to be a team player and is part of the family that needs to work this through. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671384405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp3kov/aita_for_grounding_my_12_year_old_for_refusing_to/", "score": 1334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course YTA\n\nYou're 12 year old is not old enough to take care of herself, let alone help take care of siblings. Especially when one is a special needs sibling.\n\nYou shouldn't have had a 3rd child if your son's medical needs made caring for 2 difficult. And now that you have 3 and can't handle it, you're sending your son away and punishing your daughter for being 12. This has to be some form of child abuse.", "Big YTA she is 12 she is still a child, raising another child is not her responsibility. Why do people have children if they can not look after them smh.", "YTA. You should have planned better in regards to family planning.

All of them. \n\nWtf were you thinking having a third child?", "Maybe having several kids knowing you work long hours and your wife has a bad back and is therefore not fully mobile was the first mistake. \n\nYou simply should not have more kids than you can take care of, not only financially but also physically. It never ends well and is almost always unfair to one if not all of the kids. \n\nYour daughter didn\u2019t push any kids out, which means she has no responsibility to any of them.

It would be one thing if the son was only a year or two older than the youngest since maybe the family didn\u2019t realize the severity of his condition yet, but from what OP describes there is no doubt that they were fully aware of the kid\u2019s needs by the time he was 5-6.

Why on earth did you have a third child 4 years ago? And parentification IS abuse and you and your wife are being extremely unfair. Don\u2019t you have family members that could come and help you out? Your 12-year-old should be focusing on having fun, going to extracurriculars and school. Not being a third parent to a toddler.

No reason they can't hire a babysitter if the parents are so exhausted in terms of taking care of the SN son.\n\nAnd yes - the rationalization for not bringing in a home care helper is ludicrous as well as short sighted. They should try to get some kind of therapist in there to work with the son and prepare him for the transition. \n\nI suspect that they don't particularly care about the trauma to the \"son\" when he is abruptly transitioned to \"stranger\" caretakers so long as the meltdown is not their responsibility. From reading some threads on SN kids, it appears that a lot of parents actually aren't doing any favors to SN kids but not setting boundaries because it is easier for them to appease them rather than work through \"melt downs\" and have some kind of behavioral modification as the boundaries are established - but that should all be done under the guidance of skilled therapists.", "This is the perfect way to make sure your siblings hate each other.
