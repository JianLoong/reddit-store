Lol", "NTA. She has no problem telling you she's splitting the holiday but can't tell your brother? If she can't treat you equally, I wouldn't invite her either.", "INFO Does your mother know your brother sexually assaulted you? Either way NTA, but surely she doesn\u2019t have the audacity to say she is \u201cdepressed\u201d and \u201cstressed\u201d when her child was being assaulted for years in her home. If you have never told your mother, I would consider doing so. Let\u2019s not forget there are children in your brother\u2019s household. IF she knows what he did to you, I would be a lot more stressed and depressed knowing he has kids and is going on with his life like nothing ever happened. Did you ever get help for your serious childhood abuse?", "NTA.  She\u2019s prioritizing your brother and his lack of organization/thin skin over you needing her to just give you a firm answer on when she\u2019ll be there.  Tell her there\u2019s nothing to stress about any more, because your mind is made up even if hers isn\u2019t, and maybe you can try this again at Christmas.  (Although I\u2019d recommend the plan for that be, \u201cWe\u2019re getting started at X.  If you can at least be there by Y, we\u2019ll be happy to save you a plate; otherwise, let us know when you can stop by just to say hello/exchange gifts and we\u2019ll let you know if that works.\u201d)", "NTA.  In no way shape or form are you an AH.  Your mother should be able to tell her son that she's spending the day with both of her kids and commit to a time so you can plan around her.   She refuses to do this one small thing for you.   I'm sorry to tell you this but your mother is the AH.   Enjoy your holiday with your husband and forget about her because what you're asking is not a huge favor.  It's reasonable.", "NTA - So she can put the stress of working around her plans with your brother on you, but she doesn't even want to tell him that she is seeing you after? How does that make sense?", "NTA, she favours your brother, his time, his feelings over yours. She made the bed, now she has to lie in it and face the consequences of her favoritism \n\nCus she has options here. The first being to act like an adult and tell her son \u201cI\u2019m leaving at X time to meet with OP, it might upset you but I have 2 children. Your feelings towards them doesn\u2019t obligate me to feel the same way. I want to spend time with both of my children and you have to respect it\u201d. Or she could have scheduled on day where she spends a thanksgiving with your brother, and another where she spends one with you. And do the divorced parents thing of one year you get thanksgiving day, the other your brother gets it", "Info: what bad things as if it was sexual the fact your mother's still in contact and cares about his feelings is a big no no.\n\nNTA\n\nHonestly just go low contact/ no contact don't need people who don't care about you in your life.", "NTA\u2026 Your mom is worried that your brother *might* get his feelings hurt, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care about how prioritizing him *makes* you feel. \nSetting a plate aside for her completely misses the point of having dinner together, and the only person adding stress to your mom\u2019s holiday is here for trying to prioritize one child over another.", "NTA.\n\nIt is okay to upset you, the victim, but not your brother, the abuser. \n\nTell her that her loyalties lie with the wrong person and until she can see that she is hurting you and apologises for doing so then you are putting you first, something she obviously never did. And you mean a proper apology not I am sorry you feel that way because she can't apologise for your feelings which are 100% legitimate. \n\nI am sorry that your family is crap and I hope you have a lovely dinner with no drama.", "NTA, she\u2019s prioritizing your brother so why prioritize her? Maybe this will help her see that she needs to treat you better and you\u2019re not standing for it anymore", "NTA. Your mother obviously knows you're NC with your brother. Since she's more concerned with his reactions than yours and expects you to roll over, I say \"yay, you!\" for disinviting her. Tell her that next holiday she can simply spend the holiday with his family, since she's made it clear where her priority lies.", "Nta. You're allowed to make whatever bou diaries you need. Point you to your mother that she has no issue with you knowing that she's spending time with your abuser, and that she is continually making clear that her time with said abuser is her priority, so she should have no issue with your brother knowing she is also spending time with you, and by revealing she is trying to keep her presence with you secret from him, she is clearly signalling that he is her priority, his comfort is more important, and that her relationship with him is more important to her than yours, and you are her dirty little secret that has to be kept hidden, even when it is he who abused you. That she has deeply hurt you by refusing to commit to seeing you, and that you are not to entertain her hurt this year.", "NTA She put you last in her list of priorities and you don't have to just take that. If she's going to mess you around to the point of making it difficult to plan your event, or even eat together, all because she is waiting on the whims of your brother and prioritizing not upsetting him, then she can take the consequences of treating you with no consideration and upsetting you.\n\nIf you let her just come and eat later you will be teaching her that she is correct in her assumptions -- that you will just take it no matter how she treats you, so she might as well pander to to your brother (whose reaction she is worried about).\n\nETA: after reading some comments and replies, I want to add that as your mother is still like this even knowing what your brother did, then you really have no need to consider her feelings at all. She's lucky you consider letting her in the door at all.\n\nIf you want to have any sort of healthy relationship with her she needs to learn that she has to prioritize you, not your abuser. It's disgusting that she's doing this in the first place, but I suspect she won't change unless there are boundaries and consequences set and enforced by you.", "NTA. A dinner is about more than just the food\u2014it's about gathering around the table, eating together, and sharing stories. Your mother is being incredibly rude in refusing to tell you when she'd be able to join you. She's obviously picked spending time with her son and grandchildren over you, and you're not required to remain second fiddle.", "NTA, your feelings should come first, in my honest opinion", "NTA. I would have just told her what time to be there, and if she didn't arrive, go about the meal normally without her.", "Nope! She doesn't get to turn the tables on you. She's completely disregarding common courtesy. \nDon't feel guilty. You didn't do anything wrong. Have a nice relaxed Thanksgiving with your husband and no guilt-trips or drama.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWhy does it matter if he gets upset that she might spend time with her daughter. It's not like you are being upset that she is spending time with him, so why is it ok for him to be upset about her spending time with you? He is being selfish and she holding one person's feelings over another. She is the one being the AH here.\n\nShe is also being additionally very inconsiderate of your time and effort.", "NTA. But what a stressful way to split Thanksgiving.  Why not alternate years instead of trying to cover both kids in one day? Your going no contact with your brother are to be respected.  You may have to be more demanding.", "NTA but your mother clearly is. Essentially she is condoning your brothers abuse of you. Why you want to spend any time with her is beyond me but at the very least I wouldn\u2019t make an effort anymore because apparently she isn\u2019t.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why not just do the dinner another day?", "nta, who cares if your bro is upset if she leaves?", "NTA. Asking for a time is totally reasonable, and your mom has no excuse for not wanting to tell your brother that she is going to see you both for Thanksgiving.  Your brother is aware your mother has 2 children and wants to see both of them on holidays. It's not uncommon to split holidays between 2 or more homes - most married ppl do it for every holiday.  Nobody gets mad when a married woman and her husband spend the 1st half of the day with her family and the 2nd half with his. Your brother is not a child. He can put his big boy pants on and respect his mother's choice to spend time w/ both of you for Thanksgiving. Your mom needs to teach him what big boy pants are & how to put them on if needed. Tell your mom not to coddle him anymore and to give you a damn time to expect her.", "Um... very soft YTA. Your mom did not want you to plan around her, that's why she said to do what you want and just set a plate aside for her. But I completely understand where your frustration and hurt and disappointment is coming from. I also do not speak with my brother, it's been over a year. She thinks it's cuz of stuff that happened with my niece. But it's much more than that, I've had memories resurface from when I was young, too, but I have not shared them with her. She didn't care about how much he beat on me while it was happening, she's not going to be interested in anything else that was going on at the time. I tell myself it's probably hard to walk away from your kid, as a parent I can't think of anything that would get me to turn my back on my daughter. But as an adult child, I can't understand how she could choose someone who has done such shitty things to her child.", "YTA. She already said it's fine to just set a plate aside. If you want to eat together then it's a good thing microwaves exist", "She knows. According to her he is married/ a father and a changed man.", "I was wondering this too. Does his wife know who's she married to?", "My family (close and extended) chose the side of my abuser many times over the years, until I finally cut contact with every person who insisted on speaking of him to me, or inviting him to events (when they'd said he wouldn't be present...) or insisted I give him yet another chance. They all knew I'd gone NC with him, and many knew precisely why, yet they still played the game. \n\nNo way is OP YTA on this. Mom knew OP was NC, and she has a responsibility to care for both of her children, not just her son's potentially hurt fee-fees.", "That's horrible, op I'm so sorry I hope your doing better now but can't help but worry for his kids... People like that don't just stop.", "Sounds like a really shitty mother who isn\u2019t worth the effort, who cares if her holidays are ruined she stood on the side and let your childhood be ruined. I\u2019m sorry OP", "Yes, it's common knowledge that married fathers cannot be abusers. \n\nI'm so sorry. You do not owe her a Thanksgiving invitation, and you definitely don't owe her an invitation that is predicated on her bending over backwards to accommodate your abuser. Also she cannot be the agent of apology or change for him - if he has not apologized and made amends *to you*, it doesn't count. (and if he has or does apologize and make true amends,  you still don't owe him a relationship).", "This sweeping something like this under the rug never goes well I worry for the children...", "Exactly"]}
