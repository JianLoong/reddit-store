My brother had a CCL and had a lock box in his trunk so that he could lock his gun up before going somewhere where his gun wasn\u2019t welcome. That\u2019s what a responsible gun owner does. And yeah, waving your concealed weapon around kind of defeats the purpose of carrying concealed. Thanks, now if I decide to rob you I know who to shank first", "NTA and my god so many red flags about this \u201cresponsible gun owner\u201d\n\n1. Isnt the point of concealed carry that the gun is concealed so no one knows youre carrying? If EVERYONE knows this guy is strapping, strike 1.\n\n2. You may have a constitutional right to carry, but not on my private property. Strike 2.\n\n3. He absolutely seems like an emotionally stable person - attacking YOU over a simple request about YOUR party at YOUR house. Strike 3. \n\n4. And Why in the redneckiest red neck fuck do you need a gun at a family bbq? What in the absolute hell do you think is going to happen that requires a gun? You gonna shoot someone for taking the last hot dog bun? Whip it out and use it as a beanbag for cornhole? Like, JUST LEAVE IT HOME. YOULL BE PERFECTLY FINE WITHOUT IT! The Russians aren\u2019t coming. This isnt Red Dawn. Its beans and potato salad.", "This! Had a painter once conceal carry in my house with my pregnant wife there home alone. I asked him to keep it in the van since ya know, he's in my house and there's no need for it. Damn did that guy fly off the handle and left the house unfinished.", "Exactly! Actually, OP does have the right to say if guns are allowed during an event at their place that will have children present. NTA", "I'd be very clear - they're invited but the guns are not.\n\nIf they tie their identity to guns that's their problem, not yours.", "This. If he is invited, he will deny he has a gun until it goes off and someone is injured or killed.", "THIS. It's one thing to have a concealed carry permit and wear the gun CONCEALED, and another to show off in front a bunch of excited kids. Kids are dumb. There is a reason why firearms are kept away from them unless there is a very controlled and strict supervision, not a party.", "Also this guy seems super sensitive and overly emotional. Don't trust people with emotions on a hair trigger (pun intended) around me with guns.", "1000% agreed.  It's caller concealed carry - no one is supposed to know about it but the person carrying.  Showing it off is being a bad gun owner.\n\nNTA", "I have a ccp.   I rarely carry off my farm.   Never at a BBQ.   It goes against the fun uncle aura I try to exude.  How am I going to play tag or basketball if I'm strapped?", "It\u2019s like the soon-to-be uninvited guest thinks that he\u2019s the only one with property rights.\n\nETA: Voting NTA", "Tbf my beloved pet is more dangerous then my gun.  But, I leave them both at home  at a BBQ with kids.", "Hmmmm...I wonder where Mr BBQ Guest was on January 6th? (Sorry, couldn't resist)\n\nBTW, I own firearms and have a concealed-carry permit...and I keep my weapons far away from children.", "They don\u2019t just think it, they fantasize about it. It\u2019s gross.", "Regulations like making gun free zones (hint- that\u2019s where the shootings occur)?OP is clearly NTA btw.", "Do you enjoy being afraid all the time?", "Do yall get mailers from Pro-Gun advocates on what to say to people who don't want their children to die from an accident caused by a \"responsible gun owner?\"\n\nI'm just curious cuz yall repeat alot of the same phrases. Word for word.", "OP didn't say his house is gun free, they just don't want guns at a social event with children present.", "I know, right? Such virtue signalers.", "Why is he an AH? He\u2019s not denying his relative any constitutional rights, just asking him not to bring his gun onto his property.", "Genuinely insane take.", "Out of interest why did you vote they are an A?", "Why are you so offended at someone exercising their rights on their own property?", "Great comment. The OP is just another virtue signaler.", "Yeah, and you would never be invited back if it was found out. You don't need a gun at a family gathering with a ton of kids around.", "What sort of pathetic coward are you that you can't go anywhere without your binkie/gun?", "Jesus. Coming from a country where guns are banned I actually canny believe this. It\u2019s just, unbelievable! A painter bringing a gun to work in a house with a pregnant woman? I\u2019m just speechless- like why??", "I\u2019ve had a family member do this to me. I asked them not to bring their guns in my house. They did it anyway and I only found out because a pet had found it (smelled it and was curious) in her purse. \n\nI asked her to remove the gun from my home and she flipped out. \n\nThey are no longer invited to my home.\n\nEdit:  OP, NTA", "*Kids are especially dumb when their parents are afraid of guns and haven\u2019t taught the kids anything about them or seen the harm they are capable of. Kids who are educated and have seen what damage they can do generally aren\u2019t dumb.\n\nLet\u2019s not blame the kids for parents letting movies and video games instruct their children. \n\nI live in a state where everyone has pools, so swim lessons are a must. Should be the same with guns.", "yeah, dude likes his gun way too much and makes it part of his identity", "well you sound like a reasonable and responsible person around guns and I think thats the difference", "Yeah my older brother went through a concealed carry phase (as an adult.) Every time he and my other brother's joking turned to wrestling, someone would have to yell, \"stop! gun!\" and then go unbuckle the gun out of the holster and put it up.\n\nIf it was kids, you wouldn't be able to do any kind of physical play - way too much risk of them accidentally grabbing the gun, even as older teenagers. My brother in law is a cop with three young kids. Rule in their house is you do NOT roughhouse with Daddy when he's in his uniform. You can give a goodbye hug/kiss, but no playing, no running around/towards him, and no grabbing/climbing/wrestling at all.", "Gives you an advantage when you\u2019re driving to the hoop! /s", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udfaf", "Probably participating in a \"friendly, non-violent freedom of speech rally.\" \nIsn't that what the whole lot of them called it, in a last ditch effort to stay out of jail? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "We've tried the more and more and more guns thing for quite a while now. Guess what? It's not fucking working. This country has decided there is an acceptable amount of children's blood on their hands in order to play wannabe action hero and the rest of the civilized world finds it disgusting", "Do you enjoy being defenseless all the time?", "\"Rights for me, none for thee\" \n\nIt's their motto. \n\nAnyone who isn't explicitly buying into the hyper-american view of owning guns and hating your neighbor is what's wrong with the country. \n\nIt's about the only thing they're consistent on. Being hypocritical jerks who want all the freedom in the world...to shit all over yours.", "Kids need to learn to respect the property of others and not do stupid things and win stupid prizes.", "I went in my boss's office to drop off some paperwork last week, and his handgun was sitting on his desk (he wasn't in his office). Texas can be weird. I know my boss pretty much always has a gun in his office or truck stashed somewhere, but I've never seen the handgun before.\n\nLast time I saw a gun at work a coworker had bought a new rifle and he and my boss were checking it out in the parking lot. Also our company owner had a crossbow on his desk for a few weeks earlier this summer.\n\nOh yeah and there's a gun safe and taxidermy animals in the office too. Again, Texas. Granted, this isn't the norm here, but it's also not that weird.", "Kids are dumb. Especially little ones.", "\"Ammosexual.\"", "Oh I agree with you completely and there have been so many times I will blindside tackle a nephew to the ground I would be crazy to have a gun on me.   If I'm not constantly vigilant... They are looking for revenge. \n\nMy son is almost as big as me now.  He likes to team up with the little ones.   I have to hold back so much when a small one is around he can get the upper hand now. \n\nI also have to give them all fair warning playtime is on pause when I handle delicate things.   We all still fear memaw if something gets broke.", "What are you going to need to kill at a family barbecue?", "Ya. I absolutely do. I love that in 35 years I have never once felt the need for a gun. That I don't spend my whole life worrying about how I'm going to defend myself. I have to imagine constantly worrying about threats around every corner must be exhausting.", "I mean yeah, but also this person can be without a weapon for a couple of hours. He is constantly removing it and showing it off and isn't even being a smart gun owner. Therefore, Not the AH op. Also, his house his rules and all that.", "That's... that's literally what you teach them their entire lives. But \"I'm gonna take my phone back from you\" is a lot easier way to teach them than \"Oh shit you just killed grandma\".", "They\u2019re a lot smarter than you give them credit for. That being said, I\u2019m not gonna argue with someone that thinks educating kids on dangerous items is futile.
