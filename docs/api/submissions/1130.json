As you said, it is a family business. Your son has shown interest in the company and is working hard at it, so I see no reason why he shouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to run things. \n\nHaving loyal employees is wonderful and rare these days. You should continue to treat them well and so should your son, of course, but you do not owe them the chance to buy the business.", "NTA\n\nYour wife has some strange notions, NOT wanting your son to run a company he's working hard for.\n\nYou can compromise. Set up an executive committee that reports into your son who have decision-making capabilities. Have a CEO (your son) and a high-ranking COO. But let me tell you what will happen if there's \"someone else who runs the business\" - they can fire your son. Or assign him to another region, or put him on tasks that are miserable in order to drive him out. Is she willing to accept that?\n\nShe sounds completely unaware of the business world too. And that she has too much time on her hands. Good grief.\n\nFull disclosure: I work for a family-run firm.", "NTA\n\nYou can reward employees with increased wages and responsibilities without handing over the business to them. Further, if you're growing the business the number of opportunities for employees to grow with it will increase as well.", "NTA, *if* you pay your workers enough to actually live on, treat them well, and your son would do the same. That's all you owe your employees.\n\nA family business is basically like the family estate/inheritance, and while you should aim to reward good employees with salary, it would be ridiculous to give them your estate when you die.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doesn't mean that you can't reward long standing employees who are loyal.  Ultimately blood is thicker than water.  You are definitely not the asshole here.  Sounds like your wife has limited exposure to businesses.  My husband has worked for a family business for 40 years, he is not family. He is the most talented but won't get the business because he doesn't have the right last name!", "NTA. Is your wife not your son's mother? And is she screwing your hardest working employee?", "NTA\n\nThis is such a weird POV from your wife and I don't get it. Why would she not want your son to run the family business? Nepotism would be if he'd never worked there a day in his life and then suddenly you announce he's CEO. He's learned the ropes with you, he works hard, and he cares about the business. Why would you hand it over to a stranger, rather than your own son?\n\nIf you didn't have a son you still wouldn't just hand your company to your most hard working employee because that would be giving away your business? You would sell it! Employees know how it works. They know that they are employees. They do not expect to be given a free business when you retire. They expect to get a new boss.", "NTA. Is your wife by any chance related to or sleeping with the \u201chardest working\u201d employee? Because her attitude makes no sense. This business is a valuable asset that your family owns. Why give it to an outsider? As for rewarding your employees for doing a good job, you should be rewarding them all now by paying them an appropriate salary & giving them bonuses, in line with what the business can afford.", "NTA. It's a family business, for crying out loud.", "NAH - Businesses like this generally fail and get bought out because they don't have competent management. Your wife is advocating for a smarter decision in the best interest of your business and will generate more income for your family.\n\nIf you're depending on a management buyout you're a fool. There's no guarantee your employees want to own your company. You'd likely have to hire a regional investment bank to run the process which is expensive and generally doesn't generate as much capital as founders expect it to.", "Nta and im sorry she doesnt seem to understand. There are many ways to reward hard working employees without handing them the company. Nepotism is not an all evil thing especially when your son is putting in the work to take over.", "NTA, and your wife is nuts.", "NTA - if you want to hand it down to your son and you feel he\u2019s a person to run the company after you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. This is just normal, why would you give your business to another person and not your son? It doesn't make any sense unless your son is a completely incapable of doing it and it is not the case.\n\nWhat is she on? \n\nMy cynical side is telling me the hardest working employee is working hard, just not in the way you think he is. But that is, hopefully, just too much reddit talking.", "NTA, and if your employees are so valuable give them a big raise.", "NTA. Families have passed down businesses for generations now. And your son wants to take on the responsibility.", "Info: how do these employees feel about it? Are they happy to work under your son in the future? Are there other ways you can reward their loyality? \n\nIt makes sense that you want your son to take over, but please make sure to value your loyal employees, and make sure that they are happy. Chances are that they will have to teach your son some of the details of how the company is run, and if they start to feel like they're just doing your sons job without the rewards,  that is a recipe for disaster.", "NTA.\nWhen you start work at a family business you know you\u2019re never going to own or run it.\nIf the business is a good one that rewards and values their staff they stay, if not they leave.\nIf they want to run a business they start their own or buy one.\nSimples.", "INFO Is your son qualified to run the business? That's all that matters really. It's a family business so there's the assumption that family will run the business. But if your son isn't qualified or isn't ready yet then him running the business is a bad decision especially if there are people working currently who want the job, and are qualified.", "Has your wife never heard of the Waltons?\n\nIn a family businesses, it\u2019s totally normal to pass a business down through generations. The problem with **nepotism** has a lot more to do with giving relatives undue power or influence by giving them jobs due to favoritism rather than fairness. That has *nothing* to do with passing a family business down through generations. \n\nIf your wife wants to start a company that isn\u2019t a family business so she can run it her own way and just \u201cgive it away\u201d to whoever is the hardest working person, she can go start one, but there\u2019s a reason you have what\u2019s called a *family business*, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. People have been doing this for generations. She has no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\n\nNTA.", "I definitely think NTA. But is it possible that she doesn't entirely trust your son's ability to run the business on his own? I do feel like there is a difference between taking over ownership of the business (obviously this should stay in your family) and taking over sole responsibility of the leadership and running of the business. \n\nMight there be a solution where the business is still owned by your family but your son and the most qualified and talented person share the leadership responsibilities to ensure that the company is as successful as possible?", "NTA. Your son is committed to doing a good job running the business. It would be one thing if he were a total fuckup, I might be able to see your wife\u2019s point, but since your son is solid worker there\u2019s no reason he shouldn\u2019t get his shot at it. Your wife is being weird about it tbh. \nIf you really need to exercise the nuclear option you could remind her it was *your* father\u2019s business, not hers.", "NTA. If your son wants the business, it is appropriate that a family business be passed down to family.", "NTA. \n\nSo, uh, how long has your wife been sleeping with that employee she wants to take over the business? \n\nI'M KIDDING (I think), but your wife's attitude about this is bizarre. \n\nHard-working employees should be rewarded, yes, but I don't think it's at all a reasonable expectation that any part of that reward should be to take over the business, except in unusual and clearly defined circumstances. \n\nIn any case, it sounds like your son has been working hard to learn the ropes and it makes sense to pass down the business as your father intended. You're doing nothing wrong here at all.", "NTA.  This isn't a publicly traded company.  It is a family business, and it is also family wealth -- all the tangibles and intangibles built over the years, passed from parent to child.  If you give up equity in the company to someone else, you're giving away (or selling) a piece of your family's most important asset.  \n\nNow, you may find that one of your employees is a dynamite manager and has more business sense then the family member who is next in line to own the company.  If you do that, you promote the employee to general manager and the family member moves from being an active manager to being the figurehead and face of the company.  \n\nDo you offer that general manager equity?  Well, that's a business decision, and one that you don't make right now.  If the manager wants equity and you don't want to yield any, then when the general manager finds a more suitable offer with equity, you thank them for their service and wish them well in their new position.  \n\nFinally, I think your wife has a pretty deep misconception about how business, compensation, and HR work on a couple fronts:\n\n1)  The \"hardest working\" employees are not necessarily the best employees to take an equity stake in the company and/or promote to management positions.  \"Good manager,\" \"cares about the company,\" and \"good owner\" are entirely different skill sets from \"hard worker.\"\n\n2)  If you do offer equity to employees, a good chunk of their compensation and/or wealth is tied to the company.  If the company has a tough year or, God forbid, closes, then your employees could see their investments -- perhaps their retirement funds -- vanish in a heartbeat.  Business owners assume that risk with their eyes open (or they should).  An employee may not want that risk.  Many people, with good reason, consider cash money better compensation than equity.  \n\n3)  Building on point 2, a family business comes with different obligations than a publicly held corporation, or even a closely held business org with multiple shareholders.  If you change the business's  structure to include equity grants to employees, then you take on  VERY large set of responsibilities, including regularly reporting to your shareholders (i.e., your employees) on the status of the company, it's future plans, etc., etc.  You also have to get into minutiae like whether the employees' equity entitles them to a say in how the company is managed, whether you are going to have some kind of management committee, etc., etc.  You don't have those headaches with a family business.", "Literally no one has suggested the employees should be offered a chance to buy the business.", "That's not how it works. Governing docs set up the org structure, and a board can generally fire any employee, even the CEO. The C-Suite can not ban together to fire their boss.", "\ud83e\udd23 Savage", "Because they have equity in the business, if the company is run well it generates more money, if it operates poorly under the son then they make less money. \n\nHiring a CEO who isn't a relative isn't giving away the business.", "As I wrote, the C-suite can easily assign him to terrible tasks, or send him overseas, or change his job description. I have worked at a family office where this happened, and the thinking was - take it or leave it. And sure they could fire him - let him sue while they lock him out, then appeal it and litigate it for years (I've seen that happen too) while the son can't go to work there. Possibilities are endless.", "Unless they somehow own significant equity in the business no they can't"]}
