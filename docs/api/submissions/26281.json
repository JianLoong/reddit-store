You could've approached it more gently, maybe ASKING her if she wants to go back to work FT and talk about what the daily/weekly routines would look like if/when she did, and make a plan to split everything evenly. Because even though you are stating that she works 3 days a week, she doesn't. She works 3 days a week OUTSIDE of the home. What household responsibilities does she shoulder that you don't? \n\nYou stated that you and she share the responsibilities of taking care of the kids when you're off work, but... \n\nWho does all the other things involved in running a household? Who does the laundry, then folds and hangs everything and puts it away? Who does the grocery shopping and plans the meals? Who cooks? Who does the dishes? Who scrubs the toilets, sinks, bathtubs, showers, stove, oven, microwave, and appliances? Who vacuums and sweeps and mops and dusts? Who picks everything up around the house that has been left out and puts it back where it belongs? Who takes off work when a kid is sick? Who takes them to their appointments? Who gets the car maintenance done? Who handles the budget and pays the bills? \n\nAnd the kids... Are the responsibilities really split that evenly? Who makes sure they're bathing, brushing their teeth, doing their homework, cleaning their rooms, teaching them how to do chores and supervising them so they learn how to do it right (and usually having to do it over again because kids don't do it right!), who breaks up arguments and mediates? Who reads them stories and plays games with them? Who handles school-related issues? Who signs the permission slips and chaperones field trips? Who gets the class cupcakes on their birthdays? Who plans the birthday parties and the holidays? Who shops for gifts? Who takes them to their friends parties? Who kisses their boo-boos and gets the right band-aid because 'Paw Patrol isn't my favorite anymore, I want Bluey!!!!' Who sings to them when they're sad? Who disciplines them when they make a mistake, and teaches them the right ways to handle conflicts? \n\nDo you see where I'm going here? Look, I'm not saying you don't deserve breaks too. You absolutely do. But I'm a little skeptical when a man who works as much as you do and whose wife works a part-time job and takes care of the home says that the responsibilities are split pretty evenly. They're usually not, and the husband is usually not aware of how much the wife does because, it's always done. She shoulders that so the husband doesn't have to deal with it because \"he works.\"\n\nShe's probably thinking about it in terms of everything else she does to keep the household running, which IS a full-time job if the responsibilities aren't truly split evenly, and having to work a full-time job on top of it. \n\nSo, tell us honestly... After reading ALL of that, ARE you missing the point?", "NTA - she isnt contributing equally to the relationship and is throwing a tantrum instead of acknowledging she takes more than she gives and working on a solution.", "I don't understand why your wife deserves more consideration than you do. \n\nOr why you are being selfish for wanting the work situation to be equitable.\n\nCan you ask her?", "INFO: How would your wife's side of the story sound like?", "I think that you have to look at this holistically. \n\nMy sister kept her 2 days off a week when the kids went to school. However she did the majority of the childcare and all of the transport to ballet, soccer, dr, hairdresser, friends etc. Most of the dinners and cleaning. So her \u201cme time\u201d was literally the only time that she had to herself. Whereas her husband works a lot (sometimes 6-7 days) but he goes to the gym by himself every day and he \u201ccontributes\u201d rather than \u201cmanaging\u201d the child / house duties. So his \u201cme time\u201d happens while everyone is out of the house running errands or when the kids are doing their homework etc.\n\nIf your wife is doing all of this during non-working hours, then the discussion should be how she will be supported if she goes back to work.", "You iron your children\u2019s clothing?", "NTA but sounds like y\u2019all don\u2019t have a healthy relationship wtf lol \ud83d\ude02", "Nta! \nLol no one wants to work but we all have to.

Long term stress is not good for the body and can make people sick overtime. Please prioritize your own mental AND physical health. \n\nIf your wife is not willing to budge on giving you designated \u201cme time\u201d (which is an issue but also a whole other conversation) invest in a consistent sitter for Saturday or a Sunday!
