It isn't your fault they had different pricing.", "If your sister wants to be paid more, she should charge more.  Not retroactively change her price after she's delivered and been paid.  If you buy something at Walmart and the same thing again at Nordstrom, and the price is lower at Walmart, does Walmart scream that you should retroactively pay more, because you were also willing to pay the Nordstrom price at Nordstrom?\n\nNTA", "NTA, if any other customer had catered from both businesses, they would pay what they are quoted from each, and that would be that. She would never ask another customer to pay her the difference that another business quotes. She is viewing it as you paying them comparatively or in evaluation of their product, but it is not a competition, and you paid them based on their asking price.", "NTA \n\n\nBut did your sister give you the price that she'd sell them for retail or a significantly discounted price because you are her sister?\n\n\nI can understand her being upset if she gave you a significant discount and your step sister didn't. \n\n\nAlso, did they both know you were ordering from the other?", "[deleted]", "NTA, they said their prices and you paid.

Advise your sister to contact your step sister and they can compare notes on their businesses.", "NTA\n\nYou went to each of them individually, asked each individual their price for 50 cupcakes, they both gave you their price, you paid them, transactions are then complete. You don't owe the other more because she asked for less, she should maybe look at her pricing scale if she wants to be paid more. \n\nIn any case, maybe do one or the other for events? Or have them collaborate and agree to a price? I know you're not in the wrong here, but I can kinda see why she would be mad. Good luck OP.", "NTA.  OP paid the price that was asked.  If sister is unhappy with that, she can adjust her prices going forward, but can't expect to apply them retroactively.  This is a her problem.  It is completely reasonable for different bakeries to have different prices/associated costs for similar products since their margins and situations are not necessarily the same.", "Nta - they both offered what they thought were fair prices. Tell your sister to consider it a \"listen to your whining\" discount.", "NTA - it\u2019s as simple as \u201cI paid what you charged me\u201d. If your sister charged the same as your stepsister, you would\u2019ve paid her the same.", "NTA - You paid the price that each of them asked for. This was a business transaction.

There is only one solution here: Ignore your sister, and NEVER buy from her ever again.", "NTA, tell your sister to raise her prices if she wants more.

I assume you tipped them the same (if you tipped).

They charged the price they felt was fair, you paid the price and got the service. To change the terms of contract after the service was rendered because she found out someone was paid more is laughable.", "NTA, is your sis new to selling stuff?", "Your sister gave up the difference.  1. she asked for her price and you paid it.   2.  The extra is now paid in full because you put up with her being a jerkwad about paying her the price she asked.", "INFO: how did your sister find out how much you paid the other baker?", "NTA Get your stepsister to explain her pricing. It\u2019s not your fault she asked for more. Don\u2019t understand why your sister feels this way because she got the amount SHE asked for. They BOTH did.", "NTA. When I reread it, what I suspect is that your sister thinks she valued her service lower than your stepsister, and is mad at herself for that.\n\nAlso it would be N A H too, if the prices they provided are the normal price they provide to others as well. Coz if sister reduced her pricing just for you or if step sister increased the price to get more from you, then the sister's reaction is understandable. Otherwise sister sucks for making this a big issue", "NT\nYour sister is nuts. It's like saying \"I bought an apple from Walmart for $1 and one from Aldi but the Aldi one cost $2 so I am giving Walmart $2.\" \n\nUh, no.", "Yes, they don't work together.", "Exactly what I was thinking. \n\nAlso, I'm sure the sister has charged for her costs plus the profit margin. OP has no need to pay over and above the quoted price. That's just basically demanding free money for no services then.", "This is what I'm wondering too. Did the sister give a family price and the step sister give a real price and now the sister is feeling taken advantage of? Not really sure anyone here is an AH more so just need to understand each other better.", "OP asked both of them to state their prices and she met their asking price respectively. She didn't pay one more because she did a better job. Quality is a no factor.", "They were about the same quality wise.", "NTA - Your sister is being one though.", "So many people would have expected their siblings to do this for free. They set their own prices and you were amazing about it and supported their small businesses. NTA and I\u2019m sorry your sister decided to take that personally.", "NTA your sister can and should increase her pricing if it means she remains competitive. It\u2019s on her to research market rates", "NTA you paid what was asked.", "Info: did you get an Discount?", "The only possible legitimate reason I can think of for sister being pissed is if she gave OP a big family discount- especially if OP asked for it. She might be angry to have sold for less than usual if another family member was charging full price.", "NTA. You paid the asking prices for their services. Your sister is butt hurt because she realizes she could have made more money.", "Info: what is the price difference?", "INFO: what were the designs requested? Were they the same design, was the quality the same? \n\nAs a baker myself, I would ask your sister if the price she gave you was her normal pricing. If it was, then you paid a fair price. If she gave you a family discount, then it would be a kind gesture to make up the difference between normal cost and family cost as the costs to operate have gone up greatly. It's not necessary to make up the difference, but it might be a gesture of good will. Also your sister should think about upping her prices if those are her normal prices.", "INFO - did they know you were ordering from both of them?", "NTA. They each quoted you a price and you paid each person what was quoted. You are not obligated to make up the difference or make sure they are paid equally. It's two different businesses. You also didn't just choose one sister over the other to do the job. You approached them both in an effort to be fair. If your sister doesn't like it, she needs to raise her rates but she needs to leave you out of this.", "NTA. I\u2019d pay her the difference and never order from her again. How is it your fault that she charges less?", "NTA\n\nIt's not your problem that your sister prices her cupcakes incorrectly. That is not a business decision you should be part of.", "PLEASE! Do not give the Walton family anymore money making ideas! They might just run with it!  :)  :) :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA : NTA", "How did they find out what OP paid? If OP told them, then on that she\u2019d be the AH.", "NTA. Your sister should probably place the anger internally, since she valued herself and her skills and time less than someone else in the same position. She\u2019s not charging enough and it\u2019s not the customer\u2019s fault for that, she\u2019s solely responsible for how much she\u2019s reimbursed for her labor & skills", "Why does that matter?", "Sometimes you can put a price on peace, and this whole dust up would be really dumb if the difference was like $20 or something similarly small.", "Why is it on OP to keep the peace though? Why is it not on the sister to acknowledge that she is undercharging for her work and coordinate with stepsis to come up with a better price? She's the one who made the choice to charge OP what she did-it's not on OP to have to make a peace offering to someone else's irrational anger.", "I agree with you. But I am curious to know the price difference."]}
