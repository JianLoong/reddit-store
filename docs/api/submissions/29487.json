Keep kissing your girlfriend OP", "NTA\n\nthat's ridiculous. Eight years old should know what a kiss is. In my country kids are ten when they get their first sex ed in school, therefore yes, an eight years old shouldn't be disturbed by a kiss. I for sure grew up with couples showing affection like this as being normal. \n\nAnd honestly the way your mother handles it increases the chance that your little sister actually develops an unhealthy view on romantic relationships, physical affection between romantic partners and sex since seeing it as something bad, dirty or unnatural is unhealthy. Not to mention that one of the reasons for the high rate of teenage pregnancies in the US is that adults think they should keep away that topic from children and teenagers and therefore these are just naive and uneducated about these things when they experience their first love and relationship - and when your mother reacts like this about a freaking kiss I highly doubt she will be ok with educating your sister in the next few years.", ">she kisses my dad In front of us all of the time\n\nColud she perhaps \"disapprove of yor lifestyle\"?

Your mother may see your relationship as unserious and doesn't want your younger sister to get the idea that short-term teen relationships are physical or whatever. 8 year olds are impressionable so your mum might think that seeing you kissing your girlfriend, your sister might copy your physicality with your partner, rather than there being an issue specifically with the partner. \n\nWhatever the case you're NTA.", "> I (17F) my girlfriend (17F)\n\nthat is the big deal.

When my first serious boyfriend and I were dating, she\u2019d go out of the way to facilitate us being able to be intimate in ways that were honestly pretty uncomfortable\u2014for instance, making sure to tell me that when my boyfriend and I were in the living room at night and my parents had gone to bed, they couldn\u2019t hear ANYTHING from their bedroom so we shouldn\u2019t worry. There was other stuff along those lines I\u2019d rather not get into. \n\nWhen I brought my first serious girlfriend home, she freaked out about us kissing goodbye in the driveway where the neighbors could see. \n\nWhen I brought my soon-to-be wife home, she tried to make us sleep in separate rooms. When we rearranged the beds so we could at least sleep close to each other, she made constant warning comments about how it wouldn\u2019t feel like/be the same as being in one bed (they had a pullout sofa that they\u2019d kept collapsed).

But people saying to confront her with the fact she kisses her husband in front of the kids like it's some gotcha, is foolish.", "You really think children are their parents equals?", "Nope.  It was her house her rules.  Just that simple.  Sometimes I was offered an explanation, sometimes I wasn't.  That's how it is.  I'm not her equal.  \n\nLike I said, as I've gotten older...

I personally don\u2019t think it is homophobia. In her eyes she could be protecting her daughter from things she probably doesn\u2019t understand just yet.

I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with it, each to there own and if it makes you happy go for it. I just think there is a time and a place for it and around 8yo just isn\u2019t it for me.", "What do you mean ?", "OP if your mum has never shown any issues with it before it could just be that she is overwhelmed by you growing up. In her head maybe it\u2019s fine for her and your dad because they are grown ups and married but you\u2019re a kid in her head.\n\nIf you have a good relationship I would ask her if she would mind if it was a bf. Then have an honest conversation.", "I would suggest you not give too much thought to all these reddit comments saying your mom is homophobic etc. It can be hard for a parent to adjust to their child growing up, and we all have certain stereotypes that can reflexively guide us despite our best intentions. If your mom has not actively made your sexuality an issue, don't let people who have no idea what theybare talking about convince you that she doesn't support you", "Just to say.  Food for thought:  there are varying degrees of acceptance/tolerance for same-sex relationships.  Not everyone is comfortable to the same degree. \n\nThe likliest explanation for your mom is that while she is cool with you and your gf, she is not comfortable with the affectionate display in front of little sis.  \n\nYou should be understanding that for your mom, this is probably a moral concern, which she is entitled to have.  That is, of course, the same as you are entitled to your own views on that subject.  To many, it is not morally equivalent on varying degrees.  It is her right to restrict that behavior in front of her younger daughter if she so chooses.\n\nNo, she is not 'homophobic'.  You can have a disagreement about the moral quality of LGBTQIAetc. relationships and not be a homophobe.  If she treats you and your gf well, she can disagree with the morality of your relationship and keep that to herself because she respects you as a person.  \n\nYou, however, must also be respectful of her feelings about how certain activities may affect your little sister.", "This could also very much be the case! It's worth it for OP to talk to her mom in a gentle, non-confrontational context for a lot of reasons, I think.", "I wasn't allowed to have sleepovers with guys in my room until my husband and I were actually married in our late 20s.\n\nWe later went on a self catered family holiday in a cottage and my mum casually asked about sleeping arrangements. I got the impression she was suggesting my husband would share with my brother. I pointed at my 6 month pregnant belly and said the ship has sailed on that one. She was shocked, and then laughed like I'd never heard before. It was a rare nice moment.", "Well...", "It IS a gotcha though. Because it shows that mom's explanation was bullshit.

This could just be she's upset at you kissing ANYONE romantically, and in front of your much younger sister. Kids growing up is hard on parents. \n\nYou're still NTA", "it's not a \"moral concern\", it's homophobia. no one's entitled to be homophobic. bet you have the same \"moral concern\" too. sorry you're too dense to understand that gay people are just people trying to live their lives.", "Gosh your mum! \n\nTradition is...weird.\n\nMy parents aren't even strict and I remember bring surprised when my mum said my now husband (then live in boyfriend) couldnt stay over in my childhood room - this was theoretical and we lived in the same town as my parents do, so we never stayed overnight. And the room has a bunk bed...so I don't know why she thought we'd be so desperate for sex that we couldnt just wait til we got home.\n\nMum and dad got married whilst they were pregnant with me. She was always very pro living with your partner and pro sex before marriage (she went with me to my first implant fitting years and years ago!) So it was wild.\n\nLike...she was very happily encouraging me to settle down and marry this man and have babies and my family love my husband. Every time I dated a guy she'd check in to make sure I wasn't being pressured and was happy with my sex life.  But she just had this weird belief that you just can't stay over at someone's house together until you're at least engaged. Because then the elders have to confront the reality you're having sex, I guess.  I think when she was growing up abroad, premarital sex was just so taboo that they still cant fully get over that in some ways.\n\nLike, I can get maybe not allowing partner sleepovers until college, teenagers have no subtletyor tact.  But once your child is an adult it starts to feel weird. \n\nHopefully when we have kids, I'd be like your partner can stay but I dont want to see any PDA more than a cuddle and a short kiss. If you have noisy sex i'll retaliate in kind. If you dont want to see your mum and dad getting frisky, they don't want to see you doing it! \n\nI would say that...but I think my husband would rather die than have anyone overhear our sex life lol.", "Doesn't matter.  Mom's house, Mom's rules.

Of course, they can't possibly just let you live your life and not judge you because it's not their business.
