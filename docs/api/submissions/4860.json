Ow!\n\nThere also seems to be a massive miscommunication between OP and her husband. Husband likely sees Jenny as more of his child than his niece. He's just got a lot of co-parents to work with. OP does not see Jenny as her stepdaughter. That's leading to some mismatched expectations that in turn leads to hurt feelings.

Why are you determined to make this girl feel your disdain and possibly alienate her from someone who loves her? Let's put the shoe on the other foot, what if something happened and for whatever reason your son didn't have a stable home life anymore; would you want someone to treat him how you're treating Jenny?

I dare say they all overcompensate with her because they feel she lacks the love and affection of her parents while they feel your son and other kids don't. This is something you can only solve with him and his adult family. I would suggest via therapy. Forbidding her from your Christmas is not a solution to anything. Where would it end anyway?\n\nOn the other hand, your husband should be ensuring he's giving his son as much, if not more, love and attention, and making sure he doesn't go a day in his life without knowing his dad loves him after knowing Jenny's situation.

I feel like it\u2019s normal to want your spouse to prioritize your own kid. It\u2019s not wrong for the family to try to help out and make Jenny feel loved, but at the same time treating all the other kids like less than is ridiculous. I\u2019d be upset too. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable knowing the situation that you would want to avoid that and spend the holiday with just your nuclear family so your own son can be the center of his own parents\u2019 attention.", "I feel the same. People are also downvoting OP's comments where she explains all the other kids in the family have a bad relationship with Jenny, because of the favouritism and calling her a liar, because it doesn't fit with the narrative of OP just being an AH. This comment section is bonkers.", "I agree. She needs a more stable environment. But I don't think Christmas is the time to be making her feel unwanted if that's the case, do you? There's plenty of time to bring it up after Christmas. Or it could've been done earlier, like OP voicing their discomfort. Since Jenny is on a rotation for Christmas I doubt they JUST found out this happening. But they have chosen to wait till a week before Christmas to try and kick Jenny out of it. \nThe way OP speaks about Kenny, implying her abuse isn't real, insulting her and having no empathy for her situation, hell she's known Jenny this long and hasn't even bothered to ask what happened to her motjer. this is the real issue here. And OP refuses to understand that .", "That\u2019s not at all how I read those comments. \n\nI read it as the one aunt doesn\u2019t plan to help her own daughter buy a new car in a year once she\u2019s 16. \n\nIt sounded like her and her husband contributed to the car fund, which she\u2019s resentful for since she had an older car she wanted to upgrade.", "Jenny's mom isn't around. OP, in all this time, has never bothered to ask why. I, who have been very active on this thread, am barely 2 years younger than OP (Almost 30, op is 32 I believe) If I were her friend I'd tell her to get a grip. Jenny is shuttled from house to house. She never gets to stay in one place long because they're ALL raising her. OP says she doesn't see her dad, hubby and siblings brother, anymore so they are not enabling it, this was their solution to getting her out of the abuse. I would read OPs comment history where you can see her losing her mind that the whole family chipped in to get her a safe car for her 16th birthday but her husband wouldn't buy her a brand new car just because it's a little old. Or that she's mad they have inside jokes. \n\nI would hesitate to take OPs descriptions. At face value. They have proven themselves to be a very unreliable narrator.", "I don't get the impression it's just Christmas Day.", "Thank You. This is exactly what I was thinking. Everybody keeps focusing on the son\u2019s age now, but as you said if this continues the OP\u2019s son will start to notice the blatant favoritism. Years from now the son posting my Dad loves my cousin more than me. There\u2019s no age limit on being the golden child. If the family is making comparisons now between a toddler and a teenager this will continue if they don\u2019t work to stop it.", "Probably when the child is old enough to notice, Jenny will be just one of the adults. Hopefully they will let her grow up and be independent, with no need for coddling.", "To be honest.. I think what she considers \"too much affection\" towards Jenny.. is perhaps only in her eyes. Her examples all over comments are \"they bought her a car instead of me\" or \"my husband and her share internal jokes and i feel left out\" or \" she is cocky only with me\". All is me me me I I I.\n\nI dunno. I hope you are right. But the big picture is a bit like she is jealous of the kid and she feels left out, she cant disguise it well and the kid mirrors it.\n\nWhen her son grows, she can easily explain that his cousin had a rough start of life and thats why family intensified their love, but they love him the same and if anything happened to his parents, they would be there for him too.\n\nTruth is, if I were in her shoes, I would be happy to know that if my partner and I die, my kids would be extra loved to compensate the trauma.", "As fun as the anti Jenny show is, I strongly doubt that op is a reliable narrator concerning how the child (the actual one, the teenage one, as opposed to the emotional 6 year old writing the post) acts or family acts towards her son.

You clearly would not be strong enough to endure what Jenny has.

Ow!\n\nRespectfully disagree.  First because OP does not seem to be a reliable narrator.  Reading her comments, the issue really isn't about her son at all.  It's that the husband pays attention to Jenny when OP thinks he should be pay attention to her.\n\nAlso, the example she gave for the family not caring about the nephew was he started walking.  No offense, but no one outside of OP and her husband are going to care about that.  Her son may be the center of her world, and he should be, but it's unrealistic for her to expect him to be the center of everyone elses.  Also, family members get compared.  I can't count the number of times a family member mentions a milestone of the child, and the person responds with when their kid reached that milestone.  Seen it with friends too.  \n\nThere's no evidence that the family treats the 2 year old poorly.  And of course there going to treat the 2 year old differently than the 16 year old.  (Interestingly, OP mentions a 15 year old niece as well in the comments, but doesn't say the family is ignoring her too.)\n\nI agree that OP needs counseling.  But I don't think she's a bit wrong.  I thing she's YTA in this situation.", "I honestly think that OPs jealousy is making her think that her husband doesn't pay much attention to their son. I bet he is a great dad, just like he's a great uncle, but she wants to have something to hold against Jenny other than her just being jealous.", ">On the other hand, your husband should be ensuring he's giving his son as much, if not more, love and attention, and making sure he doesn't go a day in his life without knowing his dad loves him after knowing Jenny's situation. Though your son is still very young and I doubt he feels left out or unloved.\n\nThe example OP gives in a comment is that the husband will walk by a bookstore and see a book Jenny's mentioned she wants and say \"maybe I should get that for her\".  But he's \"never done that for his son.\"  Well yeah maybe because he's 2 and can't communicate what he wants when it comes to toys and extra stuff.  \n\nI don't think the husband is neglecting his son.  I think OP is just jealous that her husband pays any attention to his niece.", "I honestly wonder if OP isn't over-exaggerating how little attention the other children get.  And OP never said that \\*none\\* of the other niblings got cars, just that the one Aunt took some money from her own daughters 'car fund' to chip in on one for Jenny.  But I'd like to point out what someone else posted earlier - the niece with the 'car fund' isn't even old enough to drive yet.  Aunt has time to replace the money in the fund and still get daughter her car when the time comes.  Nor has OP said how old the other chlidren are.  If Jenny is the oldest of them, it's not surprising if she's the first to get a car.  That said, I highly doubt that all of the aunts and uncles are ignoring or neglecting their own children.  Given the amount of anger OP has for the child, I wouldn't trust them to be fair and honest.", "OP said in a comment that Jenny was meant to live with one of the uncles but doesn\u2019t want to stay permanently with any one of them, so she\u2019s bouncing around by her own choice and all the adults are just letting her. They need to put their foot down and have her stay at just one house; it\u2019ll offer her stability that she\u2019s clearly lacking and maybe lessen the favoritism going on between the cousins.  \n\nI don\u2019t think OP should have to leave their own house because their husband just decided Jenny was coming for Christmas", "Jenny has never even touched my son. I don't think she even looks at him. She has a bad relationship with all her cousins because she doesn't like to share the attention", "She\u2019s a typical 16yr old cocky and sarcastic", "For Jenny matters", "OP commented that she simply doesn\u2019t want to. She\u2019d rather not feel like a burden. So, k stead, she rotates homes.", "Yes this", "She replied to one of my comments saying \"sometimes I wonder if it's as bad as they say\" because they \"over exaggerate\". Never mind her dad is the BROTHER of OPs husband and his other siblings, which really explains everything", "Yes this!", "This right here.\n\nI think it's wrong to dismiss the OP's feelings. It seems to add more proof she (and possibly her son) are being overlooked. It doesn't matter if the child is 2-years old: the parents will have the memories, and these might get tainted by the presence of the niece. The niece's situation totally sucks, but there needs to be some balance here.", "Apparently he does. She\u2019s upset when they go shopping and says \u201coh Jenny might like these\u201d.", "Jenny goes to a different house each Christmas. It is OP and their partners turn. Theres no way OP couldn't have known about this, assuming they've been together a notable amount of time before they had their son. \n\nI wanna focus on you SEXUALIZING A GIRL BEING PHYSICALLY AFFECTIONATE WITH HER UNCLE! Explain to me how cuddling a family member, your blood relative, who makes you feel safe and sound is suddenly not normal and inappropriate. You saw teen girl and adult man and assumed Creepazoid, rather that MAYBE she's grown up in abuse and so physical touch that isn't painful from a man she looks up to could be really calming and good for healing. That really says more about you then it does about them, doesn't it? \n\nI'm also starting to believe that OP is the most unreliable narrator. She described Jenny's abuse as \"apparent\" and implied it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. She makes assumptions about her behavior without ever getting confirmation that it's true (ie she doesn't interact with my son because she hates when other cousins get attention). Getting annoyed the family pooled to buy Jenny a car and didn't give her the money to replace her old car.  I truly wonder if OP's husband DOES talk about their son but she's so focused on hating Jenny that any comment towards her in a positive light overshadows anything her husband says about their son. Very, you can receive 99 compliments but you'll only ever remember the 1 insult.\n\nEdit; you're right if it were any other teenager.

And I never wanted anything gross with any of them. Some families are really affectionate and there is nothing wrong with cuddles.\n\nYou jump to some weird conclusions, it's disturbing and very very sad to assume anything... sexual from it.

To OP, Jenny is a spoiled princess that sucks up all the attention, affection, and resources that should - by rights - belong to her and her son.\n\nAdvising OP on how to build a relationship with the niece is an act of futility, given the obvious amount of anger and jealousy OP feels for a 16-yr-old homeless abuse victim.", "Oh no OP has met her.

Dead? A space alien? We don't know because in all this time OP never bothered to ask. It's one Christmas, that was their turn and I'm sure it didn't just come up this week.

Believe it or not its possible for fathers (figures) to care and raise multiple children. Im willing to bet your son gets a lot more love and attention than your willing to let on/Believe but then that would force you to realise its you, not your son or your husband, who has the problem and is jealous of a child. \nIt really sounds like you have a massive you problem, you need to take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror, maybe even seek counciling, as to why you would have a problem with your loving husband been a loving and careing father (figure) to kids.\n\nYTA big time", "YTA. This comment clarified it for me. You are jealous of Jenny.", "Are you even listening to yourself? You are trying to justify bullying an orphan who survived a traumatic and abusive childhood. Instead you should be proud of your husband and family who have stepped up for a young family member in need. You complain about how close they are but check out studies on children who who have support systems, especially adult males, and those who dont. Heavens forbid something were to happen to you and your husband but rest assured your son would be loved and cared for.", ">he is always looking at different things for Jenny\n\nMaybe.. because.. she has no parents? She doesnte ven have a home! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It makes me feel left out\n\nSo.. this is the real reason.. you are jealous of a teenager. God forbid you have a daughter that grows up loving her father. I feel sorry for your son too, if he happens to find hobbies with his dad.", "Ding ding ding! OP, you have an issue with your husband. You need to tell him you don\u2019t feel like your emotional needs are being met and stop pretending this is about Jenny or your son.", "And now we're to the root of the problem, it has nothing to do with your son, you feel left out. As an abused child my mother's family paid me more attention and I'm thankful for it. You need to get over yourself.you are the ah.", "She needs the attention! She has an abusive, alcoholic father who has abandoned her!", "You\u2019re jealous of a teenage girl with a crappy home life. You should be ashamed of yourself.\n\nHow would you feel if she was your daughter and they cuddled on the couch and had I side jokes? Would you resent her, too?", "16 y/o girl cuddling with her uncle on the couch? Wtf", "They cuddle? Your husband and his 16 year old niece? On the couch? \n\n\nDoes this not seem VERY strange and concerning? Since when do 16 year girls cuddle on couches with their uncles?!", "So the family pooled money together to buy a 16 year old girl who is shuttled around from place to place her own car. Something that's HERS. And you're mad.... They didn't just give the money to you because you want a better car???\n\nYou can not be a real person. This is objectively bonkers!", "How old are you?", "So a kid who\u2019s being shunted from one family to the next. No wonder they brought her a car. To make things easier on her and the family. I\u2019m sure if the niece stays at your house and it\u2019s time to move to the next aunt, you can\u2019t do it because your son is sick. Isn\u2019t it great she has a car which makes it easier on you.", "Because you\u2019re not in an abusive situation where you may need to leave to escape abuse.", "Ahhh so now we get to the real root of your jealousy. You think his family should have bought YOU a new car instead of her.", "God lord woman, the jealousy is dripping from your comments. Get therapy.", "YTA and jealous as hell!! Why are you even trying to compare yourself to a 16 year old? \n\n>I could have used that money to buy a better car for myself since my car is a bit old but my husband seems to think Jenny's car is more important\n\nYou had a car. Maybe she had none. She's 16 and she doesn't have proper support system from immediate family and so the aunts and uncles are showering her with love.. this last line of your comment is so so so salty.", "'Oh Jenny doesn't need a car! That money should go to me for a new car since mine is just old! Me me me' \n\nThats all you sound like OP, you deserve to spend Christmas alone. YTA", "No car is more important that better car\u2026", "or maybe her daughter isnt that into cars?", "Why are you competing with a teenage girl for her families love?\n\nThis is really creepy of you", "Oh I don't think so. It's very clear OP is incapable of seeing Jenny as anything else than a threat. Which is gross in and of itself in a whole host of ways.", "Because there's a difference between being in a family home surrounded by warmth and light and a sense of togetherness,. And being shoved with the bachelor uncle like she's an I'll fitting sweater being shoved in the back of a closet.", "Because your husband likes her. She doesn\u2019t want to be around a person like you who hates her. And most likely won\u2019t want her child around her.", "Want to know why she chooses just your husband? Because, whether youve said it too her or not, yove made it abundantly clear to this poor child that you hate her just as much as her father did. \nWhat makes it worse is how you go on about YOUR family as if this poor girl isnt your family, you need to realise that your neice, your inlaws are all your family. When you marry someone you marry their family too. Christmas is a time for family and its undersable that your husband would want to spend it with his ALL his family, not just his son and emotionally needy wife. \nEveryone is telling you that YTA but you keep doubling down and insisting its her not you and that takes a real special kind of AH in my books.", "Because she senses you would be happy giving her the poisoned apple?", "Well, because you've made it obvious you don't like her and don't want your husband to spend time with her. So she feels frightened she is going to lose one more person.", "I can't imagine why she doesn't want to spend time with someone as warm, loving, and empathetic as you /s\n\nYTA", "I wouldn't spend time with you either. Your dislike for this CHILD is blatant.", "what an actual trash bag. holy shit.", "This should be top comment!", "I don\u2019t disagree with you, but why are we glossing over the cuddling? In a different post last week a husband got drug over the coals for cuddling with his teenage niece whose parents had died.\n\nI get that this is not the central issue here but it\u2019s still weird, innit?", "do you guys not cuddle with your parents? just bc you can\u2019t be affectionate with family doesn\u2019t mean others shouldn\u2019t be \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "If this was her dad (of he wasn't a abuser) would it be strange to be cuddle on the couch. I assume ops husband is more of a father figure to her, because she doesn't really have a different potential father figure in her life that we know of.", "given the level of jealousy OP is showing, I'd take the 'cuddling' remark with a grain of salt.  Maybe OP thinks resting her head on Uncles shoulder is 'cuddling', or if Uncle gives her a hug, or has his arm along the back of the couch, or even being on opposite ends of the couch and sharing a blanket over their feet.  I highly doubt that Uncle is 'cuddling' the girl on his lap like he would a two-yr-old....", "That also made me uncomfortable.\n\nI mean OP is being ridiculous, but that also doesn\u2019t mean everything on her husband\u2019s end is completely appropriate. Inside jokes, attention, financial assistance, OF COURSE. It\u2019s FINE. \n\nBut walking in on them all spoony on the couch would make me feel a certain type of way too. Not jealous- suspicious of the husband. Can\u2019t be jealous of a kid when a grown man is the one in control.", "Thank you so I'm not the only one who thinks its not right", "This it doesn't seem like she has a home she's just moved round from family member to family member", "She is not either. She hasn't seen her dad in years", "No I think my husband should have done it not his family", "I'm not jealous I'm just frustrated", "Exactly! Narcissists are NEVER IN THE WRONG...", "He is her favorite uncle. She loves staying with him", "No. Uncles can cuddle their nieces to show normal avuncular affection if they have a good relationship. My uncles cuddled me when I was a teenager. This is normal. Not everyone is a pervert.", "I feel like we likely have an unreliable narrator here, so we\u2019re more likely talking about them sitting next to each other and her resting her head on his shoulder while they watch tv or something, rather than spooning or some other kind of serious physical contact.", "So are you saying your husband is a pervert then? Because if them cuddling on the couch is wrong then your husband would be in the wrong rather than the 16 year old child.", "You said her father was abusive, is it possible she sees your husband as a father figure and vice versa.\n\nJust be glad Jenny has someone like your husband in her life.", "Help me out a bit here, so I can understand your POV:\n\nIf there is something inappropriate about the relationship between a grown man and a 16yo abuse victim, who would you say is at fault - the adult or the teenager?\n\nIf there *isn't* anything inappropriate about the relationship between them, then what's the problem?", "Wow. How do your comments keep worse and worse. Also, if you really think this was a creepy, pervy, inappropriate behaviour on their part, why haven't you brought this up with your husband?\n\nFor some people, a spouse being creepy or pervy is a deal breaker (at best conversation and/or therapy, at worst divorce).", " So he\u2019s a creeper. Why do you want him then? He\u2019s not getting manipulated. If he didn\u2019t wanna wrap her up in his arms on the couch, he wouldn\u2019t. You can\u2019t blame her for your weird ass husband\u2019s behavior.", "That's what it sounds like. So a car would be something pretty significant. The emotional equivalent of her own bedroom. Something that goes to each place that's hers, truly and entirely.", "Yeah by the husband's comment on \"his turn\" to have her.  OP should grow out of this and sort her act before her husband realises what a shallow person she really is", "...which is probably why they dote on her like this. She doesn't have a consistent family or living situation by the sounds of it, so your husband's family is giving her all the love and support they can muster.\n\nAs others have pointed out, your son isn't old enough to remember any of this. He'll be fine, but if you force your husband to turn Jenny (HIS FAMILY) away, she'll be truly hurt by that.\n\nYour husband paying attention to Jenny probably isn't taking away from your son. It's a different level of attention because SHE'S A TEENAGER and teens require different levels and different kinds of attention.\n\nGrow up, because YTA.", "Wow YTA. The lengths you will go to invalidate this young woman\u2019s situation and now you\u2019re also keeping score and getting JEALOUS even more when family helps her? What kind of example do you think this petty, selfish behavior will be for your 2yr old? Grow a heart, please.", "Op, we get it, you\u2019re jealous that people go out of their way to help and love Jenny, who from the sounds of it had a rough childhood. You sound bitter that they got her a car and not you. Have you ever considered that they wanted to treat her to something nice after her rough childhood?", "do you think trauma just vanishes when you dont see your abuser?", "You\u2019re mistreating her, so she hasn\u2019t escaped entirely", "Oh god. Your poor son. I\u2019m glad his dad and extended family are compassionate and kind people so he has some of that influence in his life. Clearly, he not going to be learning that from you.", "YTA majorly. The poor child has an abusive father who she hasn\u2019t seen in years. And your jealous of your husband trying to be a good influence in her life. I would be so proud of my husband for stepping up like that. \n\nPlease get your attitude and jealousy in check so you don\u2019t damper Christmas for your family- son, husband and niece.", "Irrelevant. YTA", "So all family pools together to buy the 16 year old that has NOTHING and bounces between houses a car. And you\u2019re upset because the people who pooled should have spent all their money on a different daughters car or a car for you? Why do you hate a 16 year old with no home so much?", "Presumably the children of the other aunts and uncles you're so worried about have parents who will drive them around and are not in need of immediate and reliable transportation like the family member who gets shuffled around from home to home once a week. But how dare her other Aunt spend thousands of dollars to *spoil* her", "So Jenny deserves no transportation so that you don't have to use a kinda old car?", "Does your car still work? If yes, you don't need a new car. The entitlement bleeds from every comment you make.", "Oh child, you are so jealous.", "No you are showing extreme jealousy for a teenager.  It\u2019s all really about you and what you want and it seems to be abandoning his niece and focusing on you.  Every comment shows incredible self absorption and spite for your husbands niece.  No wonder your husband is frustrated with you. A two year old and teenager have very different needs.  Why so much jealousy and where did you learn to be so selfish?", "Sure...keep telling yourself that, OP. Your \"frustration\" is going to cause your husband to lose any and respect for you if you don't learn to accept his nieces place in his life. Especially since it comes off as jealousy to anyone paying attention.", "Do you hear yourself, OP? Seriously. Like how can you not understand with EVERYONE telling you. You came to ask if you were the AH and you're mad people are weighing in honestly. \n\nYou are JEALOUS of a TEENAGE girl because her family LOVES her and wants her to be happy after a traumatic childhood . Based on the fact you say you grew up in a relatively happy home I can see that doesn't make sense to you. \n\nDo you know the last thing I needed after spending my childhood being abused? People like you in my life. And that's exactly what I got. All you're going to succeed in doing is pushing your husband away if you keep acting like a snooty 16 year old yourself. It's one freaking Christmas,. She'll be 18 in two years. \n\nOnce more, build a bridge and get over it.", "Uncles and aunts being affectionate to niblings (no matter their age): completely wholesome and normal. Uncles (or aunts) cuddling with niblings who are teenagers: not at all normal and quite possibly concerning.", "That's not what I said", "Even better, she can actually have other stuff now, because she has a car to transport it from place to place in, and doors that can lock to store her stuff. Clothes and things. If you have no set home, it's hard to keep your stuff safe in one place. Any things she owns would be scattered across all the households she stays at.\n\nPlus she has a better chance at getting a job and getting herself to it.", "Oh, don't you worry, she'll make sure to poison her son against the abused child soon. such a bitter piece of work.", "WTF is it about the car? Someone else bought Jenny the car. I can partially understand if OP is upset that her husband bought Jenny the car. The entitlement here is WOW....\n\nEdit: so it seems they pooled money to pay for the car. Even if that is so, and if husband did pay most for the car, why does she feel entitled to THAT money. Doesn't OP have any family that she'll go \"I'll help them in their tough times\". I feel sad for her", "She deserves a transportation but no 16 yo needs a f-ing volvo"]}
