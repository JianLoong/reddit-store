Ow!\n\nThere also seems to be a massive miscommunication between OP and her husband. Husband likely sees Jenny as more of his child than his niece. He's just got a lot of co-parents to work with. OP does not see Jenny as her stepdaughter. That's leading to some mismatched expectations that in turn leads to hurt feelings.

Why are you determined to make this girl feel your disdain and possibly alienate her from someone who loves her? Let's put the shoe on the other foot, what if something happened and for whatever reason your son didn't have a stable home life anymore; would you want someone to treat him how you're treating Jenny?

Where would it end anyway?\n\nOn the other hand, your husband should be ensuring he's giving his son as much, if not more, love and attention, and making sure he doesn't go a day in his life without knowing his dad loves him after knowing Jenny's situation.

I feel like it\u2019s normal to want your spouse to prioritize your own kid. It\u2019s not wrong for the family to try to help out and make Jenny feel loved, but at the same time treating all the other kids like less than is ridiculous. I\u2019d be upset too. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable knowing the situation that you would want to avoid that and spend the holiday with just your nuclear family so your own son can be the center of his own parents\u2019 attention.", "I feel the same. People are also downvoting OP's comments where she explains all the other kids in the family have a bad relationship with Jenny, because of the favouritism and calling her a liar, because it doesn't fit with the narrative of OP just being an AH. This comment section is bonkers.", "I agree. She needs a more stable environment. But I don't think Christmas is the time to be making her feel unwanted if that's the case, do you? There's plenty of time to bring it up after Christmas. Or it could've been done earlier, like OP voicing their discomfort. Since Jenny is on a rotation for Christmas I doubt they JUST found out this happening. But they have chosen to wait till a week before Christmas to try and kick Jenny out of it. \nThe way OP speaks about Kenny, implying her abuse isn't real, insulting her and having no empathy for her situation, hell she's known Jenny this long and hasn't even bothered to ask what happened to her motjer. this is the real issue here. And OP refuses to understand that .", "That\u2019s not at all how I read those comments. \n\nI read it as the one aunt doesn\u2019t plan to help her own daughter buy a new car in a year once she\u2019s 16. \n\nIt sounded like her and her husband contributed to the car fund, which she\u2019s resentful for since she had an older car she wanted to upgrade.", "Jenny's mom isn't around. OP, in all this time, has never bothered to ask why. I, who have been very active on this thread, am barely 2 years younger than OP (Almost 30, op is 32 I believe) If I were her friend I'd tell her to get a grip. Jenny is shuttled from house to house. She never gets to stay in one place long because they're ALL raising her. OP says she doesn't see her dad, hubby and siblings brother, anymore so they are not enabling it, this was their solution to getting her out of the abuse. I would read OPs comment history where you can see her losing her mind that the whole family chipped in to get her a safe car for her 16th birthday but her husband wouldn't buy her a brand new car just because it's a little old. Or that she's mad they have inside jokes. \n\nI would hesitate to take OPs descriptions. At face value.

Everybody keeps focusing on the son\u2019s age now, but as you said if this continues the OP\u2019s son will start to notice the blatant favoritism. Years from now the son posting my Dad loves my cousin more than me. There\u2019s no age limit on being the golden child.

Hopefully they will let her grow up and be independent, with no need for coddling.", "To be honest.. I think what she considers \"too much affection\" towards Jenny.. is perhaps only in her eyes. Her examples all over comments are \"they bought her a car instead of me\" or \"my husband and her share internal jokes and i feel left out\" or \" she is cocky only with me\". All is me me me I I I.\n\nI dunno. I hope you are right. But the big picture is a bit like she is jealous of the kid and she feels left out, she cant disguise it well and the kid mirrors it.\n\nWhen her son grows, she can easily explain that his cousin had a rough start of life and thats why family intensified their love, but they love him the same and if anything happened to his parents, they would be there for him too.\n\nTruth is, if I were in her shoes, I would be happy to know that if my partner and I die, my kids would be extra loved to compensate the trauma.", "As fun as the anti Jenny show is, I strongly doubt that op is a reliable narrator concerning how the child (the actual one, the teenage one, as opposed to the emotional 6 year old writing the post) acts or family acts towards her son.

You clearly would not be strong enough to endure what Jenny has.

Ow!\n\nRespectfully disagree.  First because OP does not seem to be a reliable narrator.  Reading her comments, the issue really isn't about her son at all.  It's that the husband pays attention to Jenny when OP thinks he should be pay attention to her.\n\nAlso, the example she gave for the family not caring about the nephew was he started walking.  No offense, but no one outside of OP and her husband are going to care about that.  Her son may be the center of her world, and he should be, but it's unrealistic for her to expect him to be the center of everyone elses.  Also, family members get compared.  I can't count the number of times a family member mentions a milestone of the child, and the person responds with when their kid reached that milestone.  Seen it with friends too.  \n\nThere's no evidence that the family treats the 2 year old poorly.  And of course there going to treat the 2 year old differently than the 16 year old.  (Interestingly, OP mentions a 15 year old niece as well in the comments, but doesn't say the family is ignoring her too.)\n\nI agree that OP needs counseling.  But I don't think she's a bit wrong.  I thing she's YTA in this situation.", "I honestly think that OPs jealousy is making her think that her husband doesn't pay much attention to their son. I bet he is a great dad, just like he's a great uncle, but she wants to have something to hold against Jenny other than her just being jealous.", ">On the other hand, your husband should be ensuring he's giving his son as much, if not more, love and attention, and making sure he doesn't go a day in his life without knowing his dad loves him after knowing Jenny's situation. Though your son is still very young and I doubt he feels left out or unloved.\n\nThe example OP gives in a comment is that the husband will walk by a bookstore and see a book Jenny's mentioned she wants and say \"maybe I should get that for her\".  But he's \"never done that for his son.\"  Well yeah maybe because he's 2 and can't communicate what he wants when it comes to toys and extra stuff.  \n\nI don't think the husband is neglecting his son.  I think OP is just jealous that her husband pays any attention to his niece.", "I honestly wonder if OP isn't over-exaggerating how little attention the other children get.  And OP never said that \\*none\\* of the other niblings got cars, just that the one Aunt took some money from her own daughters 'car fund' to chip in on one for Jenny.  But I'd like to point out what someone else posted earlier - the niece with the 'car fund' isn't even old enough to drive yet.  Aunt has time to replace the money in the fund and still get daughter her car when the time comes.  Nor has OP said how old the other chlidren are.  If Jenny is the oldest of them, it's not surprising if she's the first to get a car.  That said, I highly doubt that all of the aunts and uncles are ignoring or neglecting their own children.  Given the amount of anger OP has for the child, I wouldn't trust them to be fair and honest.", "OP said in a comment that Jenny was meant to live with one of the uncles but doesn\u2019t want to stay permanently with any one of them, so she\u2019s bouncing around by her own choice and all the adults are just letting her. They need to put their foot down and have her stay at just one house; it\u2019ll offer her stability that she\u2019s clearly lacking and maybe lessen the favoritism going on between the cousins.  \n\nI don\u2019t think OP should have to leave their own house because their husband just decided Jenny was coming for Christmas", "Jenny has never even touched my son. I don't think she even looks at him. She has a bad relationship with all her cousins because she doesn't like to share the attention", "She\u2019s a typical 16yr old cocky and sarcastic", "For Jenny matters", "OP commented that she simply doesn\u2019t want to. She\u2019d rather not feel like a burden. So, instead, she rotates homes.", "Yes this", "She replied to one of my comments saying \"sometimes I wonder if it's as bad as they say\" because they \"over exaggerate\". Never mind her dad is the BROTHER of OPs husband and his other siblings, which really explains everything", "Yes this!", "This right here.\n\nI think it's wrong to dismiss the OP's feelings. It seems to add more proof she (and possibly her son) are being overlooked. It doesn't matter if the child is 2-years old: the parents will have the memories, and these might get tainted by the presence of the niece. The niece's situation totally sucks, but there needs to be some balance here.", "Apparently he does. She\u2019s upset when they go shopping and says \u201coh Jenny might like these\u201d.", "Jenny goes to a different house each Christmas. It is OP and their partners turn. Theres no way OP couldn't have known about this, assuming they've been together a notable amount of time before they had their son. \n\nI wanna focus on you SEXUALIZING A GIRL BEING PHYSICALLY AFFECTIONATE WITH HER UNCLE! Explain to me how cuddling a family member, your blood relative, who makes you feel safe and sound is suddenly not normal and inappropriate. You saw teen girl and adult man and assumed Creepazoid, rather that MAYBE she's grown up in abuse and so physical touch that isn't painful from a man she looks up to could be really calming and good for healing. That really says more about you then it does about them, doesn't it? \n\nI'm also starting to believe that OP is the most unreliable narrator. She described Jenny's abuse as \"apparent\" and implied it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. She makes assumptions about her behavior without ever getting confirmation that it's true (ie she doesn't interact with my son because she hates when other cousins get attention). Getting annoyed the family pooled to buy Jenny a car and didn't give her the money to replace her old car.  I truly wonder if OP's husband DOES talk about their son but she's so focused on hating Jenny that any comment towards her in a positive light overshadows anything her husband says about their son. Very, you can receive 99 compliments but you'll only ever remember the 1 insult.\n\nEdit; you're right if it were any other teenager.

And I never wanted anything gross with any of them. Some families are really affectionate and there is nothing wrong with cuddles.\n\nYou jump to some weird conclusions, it's disturbing and very very sad to assume anything... sexual from it.

To OP, Jenny is a spoiled princess that sucks up all the attention, affection, and resources that should - by rights - belong to her and her son.\n\nAdvising OP on how to build a relationship with the niece is an act of futility, given the obvious amount of anger and jealousy OP feels for a 16-yr-old homeless abuse victim.", "Oh no OP has met her.

Dead? A space alien? We don't know because in all this time OP never bothered to ask. It's one Christmas, that was their turn and I'm sure it didn't just come up this week.

I grew up a bit similarly. My dad has 6 step siblings (I didn't know they were step siblings until I was 18). Some uncles and aunts were married, some were in college - thats the starting point I can remember at 3yo. It was always about my dad's nieces and nephews or siblings who were in college. I think unlike op my mom loved them a lot too. My cousins used to visit our home to spend their \"free time\". My mom was not at all strict with them, they could do anything here, anytime they wanted- cook, karoke, watch movies at the home theatre etc. This might seem menial to many, but i was just expected to tag along with whatever they were planning to do in my house every weekend, every summer holidays and festivals. Not only that my parents took my cousins and aunts for shopping, trips etc. As an adult I can understand my parents were simply affectionate to their family but as a kid i used to think they didn't like me much. So much that I started talking, dressing like my cousins at one point. Even that came out as me wanting to be like my cousins because I love them so much. \n\n\nNow my parents do everything for me, I love them very much and they do too. Honestly I don't think they meant to ignore me but just thought that I wouldn't remember because I was 3. I learnt they were my dad's step siblings for a reason, eventually we became nc with that side of the family. \n\n\nSometimes i do wonder what if my aunts and uncles remained on good terms. How that would have changed the relationship I have with my parents now because the past situations still hurt sometimes. I won't lie I hated all of my cousins then, even as young as 4 yo, I was imagining how it'll be to live without them in my life when I get older. It's not like 2 yo is v far from 3 yo. Ops son is going to notice his father caring more about his cousin. I don't think OP is jealous of a 16 yo, she's reached this point of being \"crazy\" that it projects as op being jealous of a 16yo, because of how much the dad prioritises their niece compared to his own son on the premise of their son being 2yo and he won't remember anything. \n\n\n\nI can only say- as a family op, her husband and son should look into family therapy asap because their son will start noticing things soon. Like someone else on here said we don't know how many other kids in this family are planning to go LC, NC with their parents because of how much they forget to prioritise their own kids as much as Jenny.

That\u2019s favouritism and it is damaging. You are concerned because your husband doesn\u2019t think about things for your son ever while he thinks about things for Jenny often. You mentioned that Jenny hasn\u2019t seen her abusive dad in years, that she\u2019s choosing to house hop, and that she treats her cousins badly (which her aunts and uncles, and your husband, overlook because again, she\u2019s the family favourite). There\u2019s nothing wrong with treating Jenny nicely, she was dealt a bad hand in life, but the problem comes when Jenny is placed above everyone else. You and your husband need to seek out couples counselling, because this problem isn\u2019t just going to go away and your husband doesn\u2019t see any issues with favouring Jenny over you and your son, which is guaranteed to cause resentment in the future.

Your comments solidified it for me.\n\nWhen you go shopping with your husband, all he does is point out things Jenny might like and things he plans on buying Jenny. He does not nor has he ever done this for your son. He buys Jenny random presents just because, he has never done this for your son. Both want attention at the same time and he'd pick Jenny and leave you to care for your son. How do all these people commenting not see an issue with any of this??\n\nNot to mention the rest of the family - this seems super damaging to their own kids.

So was the case before he wed you and brought your son into this world. The time, money and energy he donated were his, and his alone to give.\n\nRight now, he is taking the time he could give to you and your son, and the money that, unless you do the three accounts thing (one yours, one his, one shared for household expenses or so) could be saved for your own retirement, an emergency fund, a college fund or anything really that makes your lives as family better.\n\n Yes, you're an adult. Yes, you come from a good (or at least a decent) home. Yes, you got a better start than his niece. Yes, you were more lucky.\n\nThat doesn't give anyone the right to take from you what you earned or to neglect you just to compensate for someone else's lack of luck. \n\nYes, as the bleeding hearts love to point out, the niece did not ask to be born. And no one else besides her biological parents asked for the niece to be born.\n\nRemember. Your husband signed up to be a husband and a father. He can't neglect you two emotionally just because he feels someone he did not officially take on is more deserving of things he can give. Doesn't matter that she's his blood, doesn't matter that she's his family to him. \n\nIf he wanted to put her first, he should've either not taken on people who are entitled to be his priority or explained clearly that marrying him will mean participating in cleaning up someone else's mess.\n\nYes, you do make a few not so rational points, but you're frustrated. You tried, you really did. But you're not in the wrong. It is not noble in any way to neglect those for whom you took responsibility, just to help someone who is worse off. It is different to help out once and donate a lump of cash once, than to have someone else's burden put on your shoulders for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nI don't know who you are. Maybe you're the opposite of a person I'd feel any concern for IRL. But I do know how being the one footing the bill for someone else's charity feels like. And how it feels when almost everyone around you acts like you owe those worse off just because they feel more sorry for those worse off than for you.\n\nYou're not in the wrong here, and an adult has to first ensure their children's and spouse's (in that order, since the children can't exactly leave should the other spouse be abusive) wellbeing.

But also for Jenny. Some ppl mentioned your son is young and Jenny will be an adult soon and maybe that behaviour to spend on her will change then, but for Jenny this would be shitty as well. Not everyone might take it well, when the attention they had is fading, gifts are fading, expectations arise and she cannot handle them, because she is used to be treated differently. You said she cannot do wrong. Also a big problem, because everyone makes mistakes and a honest communication about it is necessary.\n\nBut maybe that's just how you see it and Jenny and yoir husband, the cousins and others would tell a different story with a different focus.\n\nI think you expect something different than your husband, about the role of your little family and about the extended family, including Jenny. That needs to be brought on the table. I feel some jealousy, but that's a normal feeling if you are not comfortable with how the situation with jenny is handled. Sometimes it needs ppl from outside the system to get a different view on things.\nDont see it so negative, it's wonderful how they are trying for their niece. But get into communication about what you feel, see and expect. Get couple counselling. Helps to have some out of the system to ask questions. Questions set more in motion than you think and than arguments and fighting could ever do.\n\nSoft YTA how you handle it. Let her stay for Christmas. And afterwards have a talk about it.", "NOT AITA My dad used to do this with his younger sister, whatever we did, his sister did it better and faster, it was really bothersome.\n\nIf we did anything wrong, we would hear all about how his sister could never do that. \n\nTo the point that people would ask him do you have anything nice to say about your children.", "NTA, but you need to talk to your husband and tell him how you feel.

If jenny has such an abusive home life why doesn't someone in this huge caring family do something to get custody? It can't be good for everyone to pass her around constantly, or to treat her like the golden child. Staying with one family with rules and stability would be better then everyone treating her with kid gloves and acting like their kids are lacking when compared to the perfection of Jenny. I don't blame you for not wanting the niece there. More then likely your compared to her also, and he will say you sound like a shrew. I would take your son and go where he will be the center of attention for Christmas! Good luck OP!", "NTA.  Talk to husband after Xmas and tell them that coddling Jenny is not helping her in the long run.   I note that the older cousins resent her too.   See if you can cut down the days she is with you and make it clear to husband this is the last time or you guys need to see a marital conselor.", "NTA, your son shouldn't grow in this environment. Might want to sit your husband down and if he doesn't see eye to eye, ask for marriage counseling.

Would save him dollars in therapy when he's older.", "Esh\n\nyour husband's family has overcompensated for Jenny's childhood.

She is the golden child. \n\nShe had a bad dad so everyone else needs to make sure she wants for nothing  even if their own families have to come last. \n\nBut without any examples we can't say for sure if she's the golden child who can do no wrong. Or if your family just spoils her too much. \n\nYou need to have a sit down conversation with your husband and how he treats his niece. Its great that he wants to help her and there for her, but she shouldn't come before his family. \n\nWith xmas coming so soon, you might just want to let this one go, unless uou plan on taking your kid to yourside of the family. \n\nWorry about next xmas and future xmas's \n\nTalk to your husband, let him express why he's so determined to spoil his niece and make sure she wants for nothing, instead of just treating her normal. (Not over spoiled) then take about why your upset about his families treatment of her. Let him know your glad they love her so much and you love her to but you dont like how overboeard they all get. \n\nThen together, see if their is a way to compromise and for your husband to find a balance with his niece and family. \n\nEventually niece will go to college and live on her own, have her own partner, and get married and start her own family and have her own home. \n\nWhat will your husband's help and his family's help for niece look like in the future. \n\nWill it be scaled down as she gets older, or will they keep going all out even when she's an adult. \n\nShes 16 now, its time to scaled back probably so she doesn't expect certain things as she's older, and can lesrn to be independent apart from your husband and his family. \n\nBut talk to your husband and compromise. \n\nMaybe see a therapist together to mediate this.", "Well... I understand your frustration. But you can't punish Jenny for something she has no control over. You need to have a serious talk with the adults", "INFO so much is lacking. So much.

I say this because I can empathize with your frustration of your son not being seen or at least seen as good as Jenny. Although it shows a lack of empathy on your part not to want to help a child in an abusive situation. \n\nYour husband sucks if he truly does favor his niece over his own child, and would ignore son\u2019s happiness for her. Although at 2, not sure he\u2019d notice. If it continued he definitely would though. \n\nExtended family for constantly comparing one child to another with as your son got older could make him feel less than. \n \nThe bigger question for me and I\u2019m curious about is why does she have to be shuffled around from house to house? Why can\u2019t she stay in one place? It seems odd to me to make a teenager who is already dealing with an abusive parent to be displaced all the time. If I were Jenny I\u2019d find it incredibly upsetting to compound my situation with not having a stable place to live. If everyone loves her so much and love having her, I\u2019m sure there must be one household she could live.\n\nHave they not reported her dad? Do they allow her to go back to his home and be abused only to give her breaks by shuffling her around? If so, then definitely ESH.

There\u2019s a reason Jenny doesn\u2019t treat the families spouses or cousins with the same respect. You need to figure out what actually happened to her before you go all jealous wife/mother.", "NTA op, but I think this is way above reddits pay grade, which is why everyone is jumping down your throat about how dare you refuse your niece Christmas at your house. Even with all your comments this isn't a black and white situation. \n\nYou have a niece who has an abusive father, so she stays with family. Family loves her. But apparently no one loves enough to keep her full time, in a stable place, which would be so much better than her moving around. Family loves her enough to buy her a car, but not enough to communicate to her in a way that she believes it, that she isn't a burden. So she's constantly couch surfing everywhere. All the adults love her so no one sees a problem with this, despite the fact that not having one stable place to stay at and keep her things is pretty jarring. Family could chip in towards the uncle she's supposed to stay with full time to make her not feel like a burden. Money or time. Because she is a burden in some way to everyone, because she's going around everyone's place anyway. \n\nNow those adults are happy to shoulder that burden. And Jenny is lucky that she has such an awesome family. That's what you do when you have family in need. But in trying to possibly one up each other or show that they DO love her so they must take her in, again, they forget how a stable home is much better. In her case, she'll be loved either way. Why is the family making her move around, why can't they come and see her at uncle's house? Why isn't uncle putting his foot down that she needs to stay, to convince her that she is wanted and not a burden, or that even if she is, he is happy to have that burden? Because of all this you say all the cousins aren't happy with it either-understandable, because when someone comes to live with you for weeks or months after having your house to just your family, it's a bit jarring. Routines change, comfort levels change, and sleeping situations may change too (does everyone she stay with have an extra room just for her? Does she take over a cousins room everytime? How big are y'all's houses?). \n\nI also have a big problem with the whole husband thing. You and your son should come first. You are the chosen family. He chose to put you (and your son by extension) before everyone when he married you. That doesn't mean she doesn't get to come to Christmas or he doesn't get to buy her presents or things, but it's a problem that he doesn't seem to care about your son, because he's obsessed with Jenny. Like, your kid is two! There are so many milestones! They're a totally different person every six months right now! And he doesn't care about that? He doesn't find any joy in it? The phone screen thing is also weird, I know everyone said it's overreacting, but it's such a small thing to do. My phone screen is always my partner and I (no kids). It makes me happy to see him and I at one event or another when I open my phone. Your partner is looking at a picture of an infant that isn't his own and getting those feelings assumedly when he opens his phone. Why can't he do it of his own infant? \n\nThe whole extended family fobbing off your kids accomplishments in favor of whatever Jenny is doing or did sucks. But I doubt there will be much change there. But your husband should absolutely be helping you raise your son, and be excited for everything he is doing. He can also contribute to his niece, but he's not her parent. He isn't whoever she is supposed to stay with. \n\nYou two absolutely need some couples therapy, and honestly individual therapy for yourself (and your husband if he's willing) wouldn't be a bad idea, to sort everything out with a neutral party and figure out what about it is the problem and what part of that you can control.

She was \"beautiful, smart, pretty one\" I was the ugly, fat & stupid one till I reached adulthood. And my whole childhood I believed him. Every time I saw that toy at her house I'd get so angry. I'm old now & know better. Still can't understand why my mother let it happen and have NC with my father.  NTA", "This whole comment section is whackadoodle aside from your comment and a few others. There is way more going on here than op being jealous of a car, there is absolutely favoritism for this child, or overcompensation from the family (did they maybe know he was abusive for awhile before doing anything to get her out of that situation and so now everyone feels complicit or guilty that she has to endure it, so they toss her around so everyone can love on her?). How weird is it that your husband puts his phones lock screen an infant pic of his niece but not his own son, who is just barely not an infant? \n\nThere's some weird layers going on here. Op is NTA all the way but it's not just about Christmas.", "I can understand that, but you seem to recognize that the problem isn't Tina, it is The Other Woman.\n\nOP seems to ooze hatred towards Jenny herself.

The two year old and Jenny who don\u2019t deserve to be pawns in this bullshit competition of adult egos over children\u2019s accomplishments.

Not once does OP say her son is actually lacking for anything or that her husband doesn't pay attention to his son.", "Yeah she was like \u201cJenny can do no wrong\u201d and I\u2019m expecting examples of her DOING WRONG but it sounds like she\u2019s great", "I think people are focusing on the son's age because it is relevant.  Of course people are going to treat a 2 year old differently than a 16 year old.  Especially when the kids have completely different home lives (one has two loving parents and the other is homeless).\n\nLook at the examples OP gives of favoritism though:\n\n* A relative (she doesn't specify who) saying when Jenny learned to walk when OP mentions her son is walking\n\nIs that really so bad?  a) No one (aside from his dad) is going to care about OP's son as much as she does, and it's unrealistic for her to expect it.  b) That's how family responds sometimes.  When a cousin of mine mentions a milestone of their kid, other family members will chime in saying when their kid reached that milestone.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The husband seeing a book Jenny likes at the store and saying \"maybe I should get that for her.\"\n\nI'm sure Jenny mentioned, using words, that she wanted it which is why he thought of it.

There's really nothing to suggest that other than what OP provided. I just believe that no matter what, that's what he should be doing if he's not already.

There's clearly a lack of communication and consideration on how both of them view the situation.\n\nHe's \"My home is yours!\" while she's \"my home is mine.\" There's no understanding or agreement. These sorts of things tend to bubble under the surface and when not addressed becomes a bigger issue. They need to be on the same page. \n\nI can kind of see where she's coming from. Maybe? In the case of why don't you buy your own kid this, but someone else's that? It's probably more about an effort or having someone on the forefront of their mind. Like why don't you think of what your son would like even if it's just a cheap toy or a treat? Though, again, there's nothing to really suggest he doesn't do that. She could just have an issue with the cost of the material item, spending more on Jenny vs son. Of course you'd spend more on an older child. There's not a lot of information in the post.  \n\nI think she's a bit selfish and not even trying to understand their POV.

I want OP's info. It's easy to call someone unreliable but I don't get that from her comments. I also know what it's like to have family members who disappear and no one talks about them.

In this case I really do think it comes down to equality vs equity; how much is OP loving his niece (maybe excessively) *really* harming their toddler.\n\nAs long as he can get his shit together when his son is old enough to really need their full attention I don't see an issue.", "Unreliable narrator or a 16 year old girl trying to write fiction.", "I am so sorry.", "That's true, and I saw several comments asking if Jenny is rude/disrespectful/disruptive, but I can assure that \"poor\" Tina learned very quickly how to manipulate the situation and at least eventually,  made everything about her. Since I've also seen that behavior in other Golden Children, I wouldn't be surprised if it affects Jenny that way too. Please understand, I am not taking anything away from her negative life experiences, but it sounds like the family really needs to turn this around and make sure she becomes a well-adjusted adult and not just someone everyone is overindulging because she had an unfortunate past.", "Again, you're not wrong. It's just that there may be a lot of layers. See my comment about overindulged children becoming manipulative and using it to their advantage.", "Yeah... except you NEVER compare your children with others. I have friends that have children a few months younger or older than mine. When we talk about pur kids we never compare the milestones. That's because it causes anxiety and worry. Also some resentment that the other parent is \"one upping\". \n\nFor example: my daughter walked out of spite at 10 months. My friends know this because I shared when it happened. Well, one of my friends kids walked a few months ago. All I gave was praise and warnings to watch out for the running off now. At that point the conversation was about HER KID. Not mine.

My mom compared my sisters and niece & nephew to me at wherever age. I just found this out 5 years ago.

They said they remembered thinking oh here we go again with what 73shay could do at me age, and why can\u2019t I do it.", "Accountant here, I can't help but think about the numbers and the various other factors.  Such as:\n\n* How much did the car they bought Jenny cost?  Was it used?\n* How many family members contributed to it and how much did each give?\n* What is the income situation of the family members?  Are they well off where giving the money was not a financial burden (OP didn't mention anyone suffering financially because of this)?\n* Does the 15 year old want a car?  Or even want a license?\n* What is public transportation like in this area?\n* Would OP be asking for a better car if the family had not bought a car for Jenny?\n* How much did OP's husband contribute?\n\nLook, it's been a while since I bought a used car so IDK what the prices are now.  But the one I bought in college was around $2,000.  If you have 5 family members contributing to that, that's $400 a piece.  And per above, we don't know how many people contributed or what their financial situation is.  OP mentions Jenny has a single Uncle, maybe he contributed the bulk of it?  Total speculation on that, again we don't know.\n\nAll we know for sure is that OP is jealous of a homeless 16 year old.", "But if this only directed to one child and not the others, isn't it preference to only her?", "Right? And Jenny doesn't have a parent to drive her around--if she wants to get a job, have after school activities, volunteer, etc. and they don't live in a public transit, Jenny will need a car.", "Any 16 year old kid that\u2019s gifted a car is just a tiny bit spoiled. But otherwise, I\u2019d agree.", "We only have the word of an unreliable narrator on this. I'd bet money that the cousins think nothing of the sort. After all, it's not like OP said they told her this. Sounds like another exaggeration to me.", "OP is not a reliable source of information.", "She feels left out that they have inside jokes. And again! That's you sexualizing affection between family members. If this was an aunt with her nephew no one would bat an eye at that comment. But either you think the husband is some creep OR enny is attracted to her uncle. it's just a girl who grew up abused taking comfort is someone who makes her feel safe\n\nEdit; I get people have hang ups. But if this were an older brother and younger sister, nothing. Cousins, nothing. The bias of uncle/niece being affectionate is strong here. Especially if she looks up to him. Her father abused her! It's possible these are the only times she's been able to experience this kind of affection.", "Thank you - and I\u2019m so glad your daughter has you as an advocate!!", "It\u2019s also telling that she says \u201cMy husband\u2019s niece.\u201d Uh, OP, that\u2019s YOUR niece.", "They really could dote on her too much or favorably compare her to the others in an attempt to make up for what she\u2019s gone through.

I understand that most of the people\u2019s opinion is that OP is exaggerating but we don\u2019t have (so far what I read) proof for that. Also yes, probably jealous too but isn\u2019t there a reason to be jealous?\nEdit: wording", "Sounds like she is not living with her abusive dad though. She technically should be living with one uncle but bounces between the houses. The OP commented that she doesn't get on with any of her cousins because she doesn't like to share attention. The OP also mentioned that they all chipped in to get Jenny a car even though other teenagers in the family are not getting one.This is of course all the OP's perspective but it's the only one we have.\n\nThe reason she may be bouncing between houses because that way she never settles past being an honoured spoiled guest poor Jenny role and actually has to muddle in and gets treated like everyone else. This is actually not good for this girl and she should be allowed to jump from home to home. Stability is important as is a sense of place.\n\nThe OP also mentioned when Jenny is there her husband and Jenny sit on the sofa cuddling. The OP may feel jealous and actually uncomfortable. This is a 16 year old girl and **maybe?** the OP feels her and her son are being physically muscled out. If my our mid late teen nieces came to stay and spent most of the time snuggled up to my husband so the younger children and I couldn't get a look in am not sure how comfortable I would feel about that either.", "There's still no reason any of that frustration should be directed at Jenny. Why should she be punished for her relatives' behaviour?", "But it's always a sign to take everything the person says as exaggerated. The greater the exaggerated hyperbole, the more you have to mentally reduce to get close to the truth.\n\nAnd saying that \"Well Jenny could walk when she was one week old\" is a absurd exaggeration.", "Yeah, I agree with that. Golden Children often learn to behave this way and develop a really shitty personality. I was friends with one of those and she was so entitled and demanding that I really suffered and had to leave the whole friend group just to get away from her. I know there is a chance that Jenny is that way already. But since there's also a chance that she's not (maybe I didn't see a comment elaborating on it by OP), I think she deserves to be judged on her own behaviour and not on the family's dance around her. But yeah, I also think the whole family needs to take a critical look on this relationship and find a way to be compassionate whitout idolizing the girl.", "But why? The point of this sub is to judge the situation how OP describes it. Everyone here just decided OP is the asshole and treats basically everything she says as a lie. We don't and won't know the truth. So the judgement should only be based on what's written, not on assumptions.", "Well, if I were the mom of the cousin, I would explain that Jenny doesn't have a home and she needs a car to shuttle back and forth between different aunts/uncles houses. \n\nIn my house, we talk about the difference between equal and fair. Equal means everyone gets the same. Fair accounts for circumstances. Sometimes my teen gets jealous that her brother doesn't have to do as many chores as she does. I acknowledge her feelings and point out that 1. she is older and 2. her brother has special needs that make chores more difficult so I assign a similar \"level\" of chores instead of amount. She seems ok with this, once the jealousy passes. She and her brother are besties. \n\nPerhaps the aunts/uncles aren't handling the different treatment well, but the way to deal with that is to point out where the other kid is missing out, not to shun the niece. I highly doubt the OP's 2 year old is upset because his dad didn't buy him pants at the mall. 2 y.o. don't GAF. If dad isn't playing with him, that is something to address separately.", "> Yikes.\n\nNot even a little 'Yikes.' \n\nThat's just 'triage.' Jenny and the aunts daughter have very different circumstances. And a car is something a child with a very unstable home will need more than one from a loving and supportive one. OP is invoking it as an example of some imbalance but we don't know anything at all about the aunt and her daughter. All we know is that *that* aunt was willing go 1/4th on a car for her niece, but not 4/4ths on a car for her daughter. Which are two **very** different situations both in the *cost* and the *benefit*.\n\nI fine it telling that you're projecting a past onto this situation where your parents are spending immense amount on cousins - but this isn't a case of *the aunt* buying a car. It's the aunt, OP's husband and several other adults all pooling together to buy one. You can't cleanly compare that to any one of them individually buying an entire car.", "Yes. That\u2019s not her saying the family should have bought her a car. That\u2019s saying that the money that her husband sent would have been useful to upgrade her car.", "So, I can\u2019t answer those other questions since I\u2019m not OP. \n\nI read in another comment that it was a Volvo, but didn\u2019t see any other info.

We don\u2019t know if the car was purchased new or used\u2026 (Take these numbers with a grain of salt, I\u2019m not a car person and didn\u2019t look too deeply at # of miles, features, models, etc). We also don\u2019t know anything about the car that was purchased. But the price of cars in general is expensive right now, it\u2019s gone up quite a lot in the past several years. \n\nAlso, assuming this is in the US, the majority of the US is reliant on cars for transportation.", "That's a good point but I would say even accepting op's description as generally accurate the only actual comparator she offers is her son, not the other nieces and nephews.", "OP seems to resent Jenny's existence. I find it curious that OP also never mentions whether her in-laws spouses share her concern about the Jenny situation.", "No OP's are. As people here we do have to go by what we're told.

It's not unthinkable in this situation at all.\n\nThis sucks because now niece still doesn't have a parental figure in her life. By them prioritizing her over their own children breeds resentment between them and doesn't help her at all.\n\nShe needs a stable home, therapy.

One of her aunts has a 15yo daughter and she is not planning to buy a car for HER OWN DAUGHTER but was willing to spend thousands of dollars on Jenny. Isn't that spoiling? I could have used that money to buy a better car for myself since my car is a bit old but my husband seems to think Jenny's car is more important\n\nFurther on she said when they go shopping her husband will see jeans or a book Jenny wanted and he will buy them for her but not for his own son. A 2 year old doesn't need jeans or a book. There's nothing to suggest the son is lacking for any of the things a 2 year old needs/gets. OP just doesn't like him spending money on Jenny when he could be buying things for OP.", "In a comment OP says Jenny is \"no angel\" then explains that she is sweet to her aunts and uncles but cocky and standoffish to her aunts' and uncles' spouses. In other words, Jenny is a nice person in general but doesn't like OP. I wonder why lol.", "OP's perspective is: \"I want my son to get all our attention.\" That's an asshole perspective, and it explains why she's so jealous of and spiteful toward Jenny.", "There is a real difference between trusting in the details that OP gives us (I don't always, but if we never do, what's the point of the sub) and trusting in the *conclusions* OP draws from those facts.", "THANK YOU! I was waiting to find this. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that proves she\u2019s telling the truth\u201d there\u2019s also nothing that proves she\u2019s lying, all we have to go on is the post", "That is what I see as well. Her descriptions from the beginning reek of jealousy of a child who has a parent abusive enough that she doesn\u2019t live with them. Im not even going to go into the weirdos (AH) who like to exclude people from holiday celebrations because they only want to be around their family.", "That's the only thing you see here? How about OP's husband caring more about his niece than his own son?", "sounds like she is jealous of a teenage  kid", "Same", "It's not that. She's a mum. It will hurt her to see that every single thing she speaks about her son turns into praising the niece.", "You\u2019re reading one side of the story where there\u2019s an inherent bias. Even *with* that bias, nothing in OP\u2019s post suggested what you\u2019re concluding outright.", "Bro, babys are meat sacks who puke, poop, spit and act cute so you ignore their mess.\n\nOP says the husband prefers the niece but has not brought up *any* examples of preference rather than a vibe she gets. At that point, yeah, I don't see an issue on doting on the kid with a fucked up home life more than the mostly silent walking burrito.", "I think we all can agree it would be nice that someone would treat this child as their daughter, but it is definitely a concern for his own family dynamics when already someone feels left out for this new member. There are so many NTA posts of people who don't just want to take in a relative of their spouse, or their sister's kids etc. I get OP being uncomfortable, it is not her niece, she doesn't feel like the niece is nice, they don't click, she has her own two year old that concerns her. His family needs to make permanent plans for this niece instead of bouncing her around.", "THATS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT!!!!! That\u2019s his daughter!!", "But would it be a punishment for Jenny to spend time with people who want her there and dote on her? It sounds like no one would really have fun with Jenny and the OP together on Christmas day.", "Well, I don't know how the husband acts around Jenny but if he lavishes all his attention on her, and there's nothing left for anyone else in the household, and then expect his wife to do the same, I can certainly see her point.", "It is an exaggeration, but for 13 or 14 years I had a sister-in-law who was a one upper to the extreme. I often exaggerated when repeating some of the comments she made but that doesn't mean there wasn't a ton of one upmanship going on. It's a way of blowing off steam when you can't directly attack the problem head on, and it seems very likely that the OP cannot attack this problem head on.", "Or maybe it's a sign that's it's brought up a lot and there's conflicting information? If it didn't all happen in one chat/event, and every member of the family said something about it, maybe they all said a different time and so she has to exaggerate. You're really reading too much into it, tbh.", "I agree. Sometimes, people get a mob mentality and don't process what the author of the post is saying.", "Yeah but it didn't have to be such a nice brand new vehicle when other family members would be needing them soon and would see the favoritism.", "She did say they all bought her a car but another family member wasn't gonna do the same for her 15 year old girl. And since OPs son is the nephew for other people and they don't treat him special and always compare him to Jenny I believe it seems like they are putting a collective effort to treat Jenny well (which is amazing) but given they seem to forget to give the same love to others it's concerning.", "Man if that\u2019s true\u2026 OP YTA, YTFA. When I was 14 my parents separated. My dad was an alcoholic and was abusive. My mom was willing to stay in the same state with no family to help her all because I was going to an honors high school and would have graduated with my AA. I begged her to move across the country. When we moved, we bounced around different uncles houses for this same reason. Unfortunately, my family was as great as your husbands family has been. Not that it matters because my mom always showed me more then enough love and I turned out fine, thankfully my dad got his s***t together and changed his life around. \n\nI say all that to just show how much that girl needs her family. I\u2019ve been in her shoes because that was me. The fact that you would know how she feels, like she is a burden, and then have that hatred of her? You keep saying you want to spend a Christmas with just your family, go spend it alone.You shouldn\u2019t be a parent with that much hatred, I hope your son grows up to be like his dad and not you.", "We're getting enough of the story: \"I want my son to get all our attention.\" OP outright states that she just doesn't want anyone other than her son getting attention, and that explains *all* the rest. A lot of folks here are just not paying attention to what OP's actually saying.", "I think I get what you're saying but the quote you put kinda makes my point that they're over compensating jennys awful dad by treating her like the golden child & with the aunt not doing the same for her own daughter. I 100% agree a 2yo doesn't need all that stuff, except clothes as they grow faster than a 16yo. I can understand if op is disappointed that her husband doesn't appear (only going off comments & post) to have the same reaction regarding son when shopping. I admit, I've done similar with kids finding somat that suits 1 kid to a t but then try 2 at least find something for their sibling", "Based on what evidence again?", "We\u2019re just gonna take her word on that without any concrete examples provided ?", "ah yes by allowing a teenager from an ABUSIVE HOME to spend christmas with them (the ONLY thing ops husband has done) he now doesn\u2019t care about his child.", "There is nothing in the post at all to indicate OPs claims on that are even remotely true. Because he wants his niece with them over Christmas means he doesn't love his son? OP is making wild claims because she is jealous of a child.", "What do we have to suggest that's true other than op saying so? There's no examples and there's a clear jealousy going on in the rest of the post", "There's been no examples given of how he shows he loves the niece more.", "He\u2019s 2. He\u2019s a toddler. He\u2019s walking, talking a little - he\u2019s a person. He\u2019s not a month old infant.\n\nI spent time with a 3 month old on Saturday and she was smiling and engaged. Not a \u201cmeat sack\u201d.", "This is a 2-year-old child. PS - please do not ever procreate.", "OP is an adult and needs to behave like one. She can talk to her husband about any real issue with his behaviour before and after the visit, but there's no excuse for her making the actual visit miserable for anyone.", "Again, we only have the word of a known exaggerator to base that on. One that, through her own replies, makes it clear that she is massively jealous.", "And now you are projecting your personal experience on OP as if they are the same. We don't know that, and OP has done her best to make sure we can't trust anything she says.", "Read all her comments. This isn\u2019t a case of the husband not checking in with his wife for life decisions. OP is really just jealous that his family is banging together to help their niece after her father, OP husbands brother, was abusive to the niece. OP is mad that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and her 2 yo.", "I saw that but that's a comparison to how others treat their nieces and nephews not her husband. To my mind the closest thing to a good explanation for not inviting the niece is to focus on her husband's behavior. If her justification is \"I dont want my niece over because other people treat her well\" that strikes me as pretty ridiculous.", "As is tradition around here!", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. She\u2019s given no examples the the husband loves \u201chis niece\u201d more then his son. Which OP if you\u2019re married to this man she\u2019s your niece too. So that I\u2019m itself just already sounds like you don\u2019t like this poor kid. The whole thing sounds like is written by a jealous teenager with very limited emotional maturity.", "That's the point of this sub. The judgement is supposed to be based on what OP describes, not on assumptions and especially not on assuming that what OP says is a lie.", "No examples provided will be concrete, they are all one persons point of view.", "It's literally the point of this sub to judge on what OP writes and on their perspective. Not on assuming that what OP says is a lie and creating your own narrative", "What do you have to suggest that OP is lying? It goes both ways. You're supposed to judge on what's written, not on assumptions.", "Shit, I can't wait to finish school so I can be a dad, it's a lifelong dream of mine.\n\n\n\nBut like people often say, all kids are terrible except your own and as long as he's giving adequate attention to the two year old I don't see a problem with giving the abused homeless teenager more support while his baby can't string together a coherent sentence or grasp the concept of time.", "Well, in that case, we need more information.", "Why even bother reading the post if you\u2019re just gonna assume it\u2019s all lies over the use of hyperbole. That\u2019s a super common literary device", "\u201c OP has done her best to make sure we can't trust anything she says.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of exaggeration lol", "No, we don't know that, but unfortunately that's the only thing we have to draw from. I can't share your personal experiences!!", "The world doesn't revolve around Jenny either. She has learned to become manipulative and has narcissistic tendencies from what I am reading. The family is over compensating and destroying everyone else's family in the wake. \n \nCuddling with uncle at 16 while watching movies while ignoring the rest of the family is creepy as fuck for everyone involved. Guaranteed if Jenny's boyfriend saw that he'd be weirded out too.\n\nOp's husband needs to tone it down with the Jenny saved as the wallpaper on his phone type behavior.\n\nAlso, the world may not revolve around OP and her 2 year old, but it does in her own home.", "*Tevye sings*: \"Tradition!\"", "Apparently she has in comments I havent read them yet though.", "Oh, absolutely not. One of the things I find most interesting about this sub is sorting through how reliable the OP is as a narrator. If OP wants me on her side she has to give a concrete example of her son suffering because people also love his cousin.", "We are to have zero UnreliableNarrator scrutiny?", "True, but OP doesn\u2019t even offer a real example. The fact the husband lives at home and talks to his wife about Christmas plans in itself makes her claims that he doesn\u2019t care about his own son sound ludicrous. It reads much more like she is upset that he loves his niece, too \u2014 not that he is actually an unloving or deadbeat father.", "Believing wild claims is not the point of the sub. OP has also mentioned what her husband has done to show how he doesn't care, he has his phone background as a picture of his niece instead of his son, that's all.", "This is OP in her own words, responding to a comment:\n\n>For her 16th birthday her family bought her a new car. One of her aunts has a 15yo daughter and she is not planning to buy a car for HER OWN DAUGHTER but was willing to spend thousands of dollars on Jenny. Isn't that spoiling? I could have used that money to buy a better car for myself since my car is a bit old but my husband seems to think Jenny's car is more important\n\nIt is not about the son, it is about her being jealous.", "Right, and if shit seems to be missing from the post, or things don\u2019t add up (like concrete examples of the husband actually neglecting his child to favour the niece) it is normal to request that info to be able to make a fair judgement lol. Even the added info of buying the niece gifts or having her as his phone wallpaper is absolutely not neglecting his son - his son has two living and loving parents taking care of him, and it is clear that the niece does not. Having the rest of your family raise you and show you love still doesn\u2019t make up for not having parents / having abusive ones.", "Op, YTA. What do you have that she's not? She says this year is their turn for Christmas. That means, they were alone last year. Families always compare kids. This niece was shared because of ah parents. So all have a parent child relationship with her. Parents compare kids all the time. All the time. Especially mother's. Guarantee her friends do the same and she probably gloats when her child reaches milestones sooner as well. I've yet to meet a mother that doesn't. She seems jealous that a non bio kid has attached to everyone like their child due to circumstances beyond the child's control. Guaranteed, if the niece posted this story from her perspective, you would be calling Op a massive Ah and telling her to go NC as is the way of Reddit.", "Info we can't trust because OP has shown herself to be untrustworthy.", "So this is a fictional story then? Thanks for clearing that up.", "Right? I think this sub just hates hyperbole", "I was getting vibes of the family over-compensating too.", "No! Dismiss all common sense and life experience ye who enter here\n\nWe can accept the facts an OP presents without agreeing with the conclusions they draw from those facts.", "Have you not read any of OP's comments? She names several examples, including her husband buying Jenny surprise gifts but never doing the same for her and their son, and him using a baby photo of Jenny as his phone background but refusing to do the same with a baby photo of his *own kid.*", "Husband probably heaps praise and love on Jenny because she can actually understand that and needs positive affirmations. The infant doesn\u2019t know or care yet (mostly). It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love his son, but OP sees any other child getting love and affection and she says husband hates everyone else. \ud83d\ude44", "We don't know that.", "You know \u201cstory\u201d doesn\u2019t mean fictional, right? You can tell \u201cstories\u201d about real things that have happened or are happening"]}
