He should prioritize you over Mommy Dearest and is failing you. That is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nAnd I kinda wanna give you a very careful hug. My Ex partner is autistic, so I try to talk to you like I would talk to him. Although, he wouldn't be in your shoes with me, ever.\n\nFirst:\nIt is your home in equal parts to his home. Even when you live in a palace, you are a couple. A team. He is not your superior, therefore he can't allow visitors in without your clearly stated consent.\n\nYou did not only not give your consent loud and clear,  you also stated your reasons.\n\nSecond:\nYour reasoning is understandable. This has nothing to do with your autism. Your MIL behaves awfully, and your husband enables her behaviour.\n\nYou might be used to bend for his reasoning, as you experienced at various times in your life, how you read social clues wrong.\n\nYour gut reaction told you to get a second opinion here for a reason. You are allowed to trust yourself more.\n\nWhenever your gut tells you something doesn't feel good, listen to it. Even if you are not able to word the why, that is not necessary. You are allowed to say no without an explanation even. \"I'm not feeling okay with this\" is legit!\n\nThird:\nYour husband is an enabler of his mother. He does not view you as a ne nucleus, as a new core family. Even when he married you, he didn't made the shift from his parents to you being the most important person in his life.\n\nWhen you pick a spouse, you decide this person is your new focal point in life. This person is the center of your new family.\n\nOf course this does not erase your past, nor is it okay to cut your parents completely out for the whims of a spouse.\n\nThen again, those aren't whims and nobody was cut out. It is very, very reasonable to have her stay in a hotel. You even offered to pay for her.\n\nHe chose to not confront his mother, and instead confront you. He picked her over you.\n\nHe might even did that in the past, although only you will be able to tell when reviewing your past interactions. Trust your gut feeling here.\n\nHe broke a core part of what is expected when you marry. This is an issue you should address in couple therapy if you chose to. Make sure to pick a counselor who knows about autism please.\n\nFourth:\nTotally within your right to stay at a hotel, and to pay it yourself if he doesn't want to pay for it.\n\nI think he should pay for your stay, but that seems of the chart for now. Keep it in mind for the therapy. This needs to be reviewed.\n\nTaking care of your own needs is an adult thing to do. You did not consent to hosting your MIL, nor did you consent to sharing your safe space.\n\nA lot of people with autism struggle with changes if environment. You are doing very good adjusting here!\n\nEnjoy your stay. Splurge if you can afford it and feel like it. Nothing wrong with pampering yourself for the stressful situation you found yourself in. Maybe even consider getting pedicure if you feel like it, or a massage, or visit the sauna.\n\nWhatever makes you feel good is allowed!\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry for how inconsiderate your husband is.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA- 65 isn\u2019t elderly.

Go the the hotel. Charge it to your husband's cards. Go VLC with his toxic family.\n\nEdit: Also, strongly advise that you DO NOT breed with or for this man. Considering his behaviour with your very clear and basic needs right now, I would absolutely NOT expect him to step up in terms of fatherhood.", "NTA, and autistic woman here, as well.  However, the issues your MIL presents are universally despised by neurotypicals and autistics alike.  I'm also from a culture that places great emphasis on hospitality and entertaining, but what is happening here goes beyond a mere visit by a relative.  Someone else is creating the situation, and yet you seem to be the one bearing the mental and physical workload associated with that situation...All while being criticized by everyone for doing something besides just accept the situation and deal with your MIL's frankly rude behavior.  It appears to me that your MIL insists on your home because your working from home means that she will have someone available at all times to cater to her whims and keep her from being alone.  Sadly, most people view \"working from home\" as meaning you can just take off whatever time you want, and we both know that is not reality.\n\nYour husband seems to not be putting in much effort in making sure your MIL does not interrupt your household.  Dare I say he's too accommodating, and too free with offering your time and effort for his mother's exclusive exploiting?  Also, why is he not telling his mother off for bad-mouthing you to his relatives?  He is the one being selfish here:  he brings his mother into your shared, too-small apartment, then simply allows her to ride roughshod over you.  Since that is his relative, he should be the one telling her to be a well-behaved guest instead of an overbearing, loudly complaining presence.  If your food is so bad and you are such a rude person, why would your MIL insist on going there a second time?  No wonder she says you're 'unfriendly', no one is going to be congenial and happy with a woman invading her home, disrupting her work schedule, and demanding free catering and party services.  She seems to be treating you like a lazy servant, instead of the person whose home is being shared with a guest.\n\nI've noticed that people who are criticizing you aren't exactly lining up to host your MIL themselves.  Obviously, there are other relatives in the immediate vicinity, as she invited them over to your place.  Why are these people not inviting your MIL over to stay?  The answer here is simple, I think:  other relatives offering \"hospitality\" would mean that they would have to deal with her actions and her taking over their home.  It's far easier for those relatives to criticize you instead and shame you for standing up for yourself.  And it's far easier to take advantage of someone else's home for visiting.\n\nYou're not \"selfish\".  That is an accusation lobbed when a person refuses to be bullied into doing something that they don't want to, and the person instead makes a different choice that forces the bully to have to put in the effort, instead.  I think it's fair that you pay for your hotel room, since you are the person who decided not to stay in the home while your MIL was there.  But take comfort in the fact that your husband will be the one listening to his mother complain about his cooking, cleaning, and lack of time availability.  After all, he is her son, and he (and not you) is why she is visiting...Right?  Then let him take care of the \"hospitality\" without you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I love when friends come over for a few hours and I cook for them, make drinks, I like the whole planning a menu, going shopping, cooking and playing games with them to keep them entertained, getting them a blanket, etc. but when my family comes to visit they have learned to get an Airbnb close by so they can come over and then leave for the night. My husband has helped me politely put that boundary up after one time they came to stay in our 1 bedroom and it stressed me the hell out. It was an awkward 5 minute conversation but they didn\u2019t get upset with me. I\u2019ve been this way for my whole life even in the reverse (I\u2019ve always asked to be picked up from sleepovers early in the am and preferred activities with a time limit as a kid) so I think they understood where I was coming from. Of course this is your MIL not ur mom so she doesn\u2019t know you as well but she is acting crazy because it\u2019s not that hard to empathize with someone who has different comfort levels than you."]}
