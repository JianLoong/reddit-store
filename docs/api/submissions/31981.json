I'm coming at this from the bias of the older sibling who was forced to have the younger one hang out with my friend group every summer holiday - \"you can't go with your friends unless you take your brother\" was a frequent reply from our mother. It was awful.\n\n\nI hated him. Truly hated. He was immature and would make up shit that caused problems with my friends to sound \"cool\". If I tried to pull him into line he'd run back to our mother to cry about how awful I was. What finally put an end to it was the day the group split in half; the stronger swimmers went out to the beach including me. I told my bro to go with the crew playing soccer, but he refused. He was 14 and almost drowned when he got caught in a rip tide. He was damn lucky I spotted him in time to save him. It nearly took out both of us and I honestly hated him even more for nearly killing us both JUST to prove he was popular with my friends - which he wasn't.\n\n\nForcing a relationship that doesn't exist is going to breed resentment that will show up in different ways and possibly destroy their chance at an adult relationship.

Explore if there is social skills training available for Emily to up her game. Explore if there are lunch time activities at the school. Explore if there are hobby clubs so she at least has some form of friends, even if they cannot sit together at lunch. Ask her if she knows how to make friends, and talk through the steps.

Now Cindy is quite popular, she is on the volleyball team and has a huge friend group. My youngest isn\u2019t very popular and her friend (Beth) is her main friend or ex friend. It also doesn\u2019t help that she is into hobbies most other high schoolers don\u2019t care about.\n\n\nEmily and Beth got into a fight and Beth is not speaking to her anymore. She is sitting alone at lunch now. This came out yesterday and my husband wants Cindy to invite her to sit with her group of friends at the \u201cpopular table\u201d. Cindy refused saying she doesn\u2019t want to do that. \n\nMy husband was mad but when he tried to get me to back him up I told him Cindy has ever right to not want her little sister in her friend group. That you can\u2019t do that do her and Emiliy needs to make her own friends.\n\nMy husband is pissed at me and Cindy. Emilie is super upset that she doesn\u2019t have people to eat with and I am wondering if I made the right call or if I am being a jerk.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She will feel like an interloper and probably just sit quietly and feel awkward. Even if the girls are nice and try and chat to her, they\u2019ll only be doing it to be kind from a sense of obligation and the 14yr old will feel that. Especially is the 16yr olds feel too uncomfortable to talk about friend things in front of her (making plans, personal matters, etc). \n\nI had some friends of differing ages in school but my school was quite large so we mostly just hung out with our own grades, so it might be different for others but to me, a bunch of 16yr olds being somewhat forced to sit with a younger 14yr old is not a great starting point. Especially if the sisters aren\u2019t friends already.\n\nWhen I was 12-14yrs old I had many lunches where I had to awkwardly eat alone. I brought a book (I love books) to try and make it seem okay to others. It forced me to make new friends. I shoe horned my way into sitting with some people when I was 15. I made excuses for a couple days until it felt somewhat natural for me to just sit there. And then we became great friends. She\u2019s just gotta get out there.", "NTA. It would be great if Cindy was the type of person to go and sit with her sister during lunch, so maybe we should be asking ourselves what type of human beings we\u2019re raising, right mom?

Husband isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting to help younger daughter but it\u2019s not gonna happen.", "NTA- Emily needs to find an activity at the school she enjoys and then she\u2019ll meet people who enjoy it.

The popular daughter shouldn't have to have Emilie sit at the popular table. However, I would draw a clear line in the sand for older daughter...she should know that she should not bully or assist in the bullying of Emilie. This may not be currently happening but teens can be awful. Also what are Emilies hobbies? If you tell us we may have some ideas to help Emilie find her tribe so to speak.", "NTA. Forcing her to sit with her older sister will actually prevent her from making friends that actually want her around. In addition it will strain her sister\u2019s relationships.", "NTA\n\nThey are two years apart. It would be very forced to have Emily sit with Cindy under duress.\n\nYou need to help Emily develop her social skills. She needs to nurture prospective friendships and is likely very shy. I was a shy kid so I can relate. Maybe some role playing, so you work through social situations and she can practice a script that may make her less nervous.\n\nKeep looking into thing that can help her social skills.", "NTA. Don\u2019t force Cindy to include Emily in her friend group. If you do this could lead to a lot of negativity and resentment between the two of them. Instead encourage Emily to try and break out of her shell and make new friends.

But definitely don\u2019t force Cindy and Emily to be friends if they\u2019re not ready to be. \n\nMy sister and I were not friends growing up. However once she went off to college and we were no longer living under the same roof we started to become closer and now we\u2019re great friends and we talk on the phone all the time. I think had our parents tried to force us to be friends when we were in middle/high school that would\u2019ve caused some serious resentment between us that would have prevented us from being as close as we are now. But because they gave us room to be our own people and to grow separately that allowed us to bond later in life and have the great relationship that we have now. So while I understand your husbands desire to help his little girl and to not want her to be lonely I think forcing your daughters to be friends now will prevent them from actually being friends in the future", "It's not just that Emily needs to find her own way - it's that there's a world of difference between their ages right now, in social groups.

I was that girl with a very small group of friends if not only having one or two at a time.

Maybe you could encourage Cindy to go and sit with Emily, just the two of them, one day during lunch. That way Emily can have some company and feel the support of her sister, and Cindy doesn't have to feel awkward with her sister and friends mingling together inorganically. \n\nSo you know where I'm coming from, I am the older sister to one younger sister. We're all grown now. Even though there were so many times I found her annoying as hell, at the end of the day, she's still my sister, and I've always been very protective of her.

The only fair way Cindy or any of her friends should introduce anyone else to the table is to ask everyone else if it would be alright. Emily is not going to always have Cindy around to be a buffer and it isn't her responsibility. Emily may not gain many friends in HS but once she gets to college she will blossom. Maybe look around and find a group that is based on her hobbies where she can meet people with a similar interest.", "NTA. she will live.

I think that forcing her sister to invite her to her lunch table would do more harm than good bc if sister doesn\u2019t want her there then it\u2019s likely her other friends don\u2019t either & may be mean to Emily. Cindy is 16 & Emily is 14 as well. That\u2019s likely junior vs freshman. Dynamics in high school are hard. Does the school have a counselor she can turn to? Or a favorite teacher? Perhaps she could explore having lunch with them. I know it\u2019s not ideal but it could help her for now. Best of luck to you & your girls", "NTA. Of course when your kids are young you want to teach them to be inclusive and not push people out but as teenagers they are old enough to choose their own friends. Your daughter losing a friend is her business and doesn\u2019t mean her sister should have to include her in her friend group.", "NTA\n\nLooking at it from the younger daughters side. If she was to go sit with them there is no doubt in my mind based on what you wrote that her sisters friends would bully her while there. More so because of the forced joining. There are very rare instances where that isn't the case, but to me it seems your children already do not get along. It will only make the gap wider between the two and make more kids at school separate from her as well.\n\nThe better answer here would be to try and get your youngest daughter to join a club at school to make new friends. Book club, yearbook, anything that interests her. \n\nForcing her to sit with others will most definitely make them not want to be her friend because that will be their first impression. I know from personal experience.", "NTA. That is not a good idea.

I had zero expectations she was supposed to elevate my social status, and I couldn't stand her.  Highschool is lame, but Emily is better off learning now how to socialize than in the real world. Does she have any specific interests? Even weird ones. There are like anime clubs, books, Warhammer, knitting? .. I dunno. Whatever she's into there's a group.

As a young girl once myself, I would not want to sit at the popular girl table out of pity, I would have much preferred being alone.  But, Cindy can help in other ways.  She can say Hi to her sister when walking by.  Ask about her day here and there.  Smile and wave while walking in the halls.   Just randomly give her a hug here and there.  Just to let her sister know that at least, she is not invisible to her, and there by, not invisible to others.  They do not have to be best friends, but kindness, especially in your own family, goes a long way.", "Emily needs to get into interest groups ones that have similar interests with her whether it's in school or out of school so she can make friends on her lone.  no one can force friendship on people like your husband want Cindy to do.  Nature has to be free to do its thing and believe me as a very unpopular guy in school Emily will find her way eventually.", "NTA\n\nIt's not clear what their squabble/argument even was about to start with - but it sounds a lot like Beth has chosen to sit alone at lunch now?\n\nRegardless, it's certainly not one child's responsibility to \"adopt\" the other into their social/friend group at school - there's no harm in asking one to keep the other company or check in on them as a choice, but not to \"demand\" it.\n\nAll it's going to achieve is have one sibling resent the other as _they_ will then be the likely target of ridicule from their own friends and will all probably pick on both of them as a result, which isn't a net win for anyone.\n\nIf Emily has less conventional hobbies or interests it's worth investigating if she _wants_ company to start with, as let's be fair here some kids are totally happy being either alone or with few friends.\n\nBe her friend, sit and talk with her, see if she _wants_ help or direction with making friends and doing things with others. If she does? Well, start to look at what options are available for her with local groups or those you can feasibly travel and take her to, but let it be on her terms and her choice and not a push.", "NTA - teenage friend groups are complicated, and having Cindy invite Emily to the table might not work well with Cindy\u2019s friends.

I have three teens and they have their own separate friends, and they hang out separately, don\u2019t always include each other if they have friends over to the house.

While it might be nice for Cindy to sit with her sister for a day or two while things settle down it isn\u2019t her responsibility to coddle Emily while at school.

Forcing relationships is always a terrible idea and in this case may very well damage the existing relationship between the girls. Neither kid is going to be happy about the situation at the end, because even in the best case scenario everyone will know why Emily is sitting there and she\u2019s going to either be pitied or ignored. It will come out that she has no other friends and she may end up feeling worse than if she had sat alone to eat. Kids can be brutal and you most definitely don\u2019t want Emily to experience that. \n\nBut this definitely isn\u2019t a situation in which parents need to intervene, this is a situation where you support Emily in her feelings and help her determine a plan, not make her Cindy\u2019s problem.

It\u2019s one thing to suggest to Cindy to help out her sister while she\u2019s having a hard time, because in this case you\u2019re giving her space to do it in a way that makes sense for the relationship. You can suggest Cindy  talk to her sister (at home, most likely) or give her extra  space if that\u2019s appropriate. But ultimately this is not Cindy\u2019s issue to handle. Don\u2019t give her the responsibility of her sister\u2019s social life or she will absolutely grow to resent her.", "If it hasn't been suggested already, there's a compromise solution - Cindy could stop at the popular table, say hi to her friends, then say \"my sister is having a hard time right now, I'm going to have lunch with her\", then spend some time with her sister.  Doesn't have to be every day.  Her friend group will get it, even assume that parents are making her.  IF they are not total mean girls, they will think its the right thing too.  IF they are, they'll still assume its under parental threat.  So no loss of rep.\n\nAges for high school can be misleading - but it looks like Junior and Freshman?  If so, Junior could also help Freshman find some school clubs that might be interesting to her.", "You are kind of being a jerk!

Love is messy and inconvenient, but well worth the time and effort. You will find no greater investment in life than unconditional love. Providing a refuge for Emily at lunch time is something a kind and secure older sister would do. Emily could even just sit nearby and read a book or knit within earshot and occasionally be included in conversations. \n\nCindy's friends in no way have to be Emily's friends, but what a good example she could set for them by being a leader and going out of her way to include her sister somehow.

I think you and the big sister are jerks to let her have no friends until hopefully someone comes to the school. And bring her into her friends doesn't mean she can't find friends outside her sister's friends it might open her up to be more friendly. Like the big sister can find and will find friends outside this school friend group. And the only real friend the big sister has beside the best friend is a lil sister. Maybe you should start trying to get them to become friends now when they are young instead of waiting when they are adults and estranged from each other and you're worried why aren't they closer. We obviously don't want nor think the lil sister will take over the big sister's friend group but the big sister can protect her from feeling like a outsider and someone takes advantage of her because of her feelings. The big sister can be the great big sister who her friends are great and welcome her sister in or have fake friends that will be mean to her lil sister and stop hanging out with the big sister. I would ask to your oldest if she has great friends, talk to her about why she doesn't want her lil sister in her friend group, try to convince her to invite her, for them to try to get to know each other, and find similar things they both like. I don't know you're kids and if forcing won't make things worse in their relationship because if the big sister doesn't want her lil sister around her friends that is telling and someone need to look into that. Because I have a older sister and we never was in the same school together but I know she would do this to me because she had a problem with me because I became the baby and she wasn't anymore. But if it was my lil sister I would love to bring her into my group as long as she is not a messy person who will do things behind my back to mess up my place in the group or the group as a whole. And if the lil sister is like that then both you and big sister NTA. If not than would your oldest want the same treatment if the roles were reversed? No matter the answer talk to Emily about this hypothetically to see if she would want it because she might not want to sit with her sister and her friends.

She couldnt really fit in, we were older, but we just painted her nails. Cus why not.\n\nI was a teenager once, and angsty one at that. So dont tell me about being a teen. You're too funny. I've seen plenty of siblings not being ok to exclude or leave their sibling a loner in the same school or get bullied, because its also a pride thing. Different family values and morals i guess.\n\nI mean my own husband used to pick his own sister up from school even when she was a teen and was sick. Ironic, they HATED each other so much, but when it came to important stuff, he NEVER left her alone.\n\nAnd a response to a point you missed by a MILE, sister doesnt HAVE to include her in her personal life, she can step out of it and simply keep company to her sister outside of her friend group. Its not that hard to say to friends, that she'll be keeping company to her sis that day \\^ read above example.\n\nAnd forcefully tossing your younger sister into a much older group is like tossing a helpless sheep to the wolves.

Not to mention that refusing to include your sibling in your personal life isn't an indicator of how much or how little you love them\n\nMy teens did sit/help their siblings in tough times.

Where do you think i got education? A barn?", "That would be a failing of the older sister. In his best man speech my brother talked about how when a bully my age hit him in the face with a snowball, the next thing he saw was me flying in the air having launched myself at the kid.

One of these days Cindy is going to need or want something from her sister and I hope she remembers this when the time comes. I absolutely hate society anymore. Also generally it\u2019s not the friend group who has an issue with the little sibling, it\u2019s the sibling themselves. My older daughter\u2019s friends like my younger daughter (same age ranges) but anytime she even catches them talking she gets almost possessive and jealous. Not to long ago my older daughter\u2019s friend (a guy we\u2019ve known since she was a freshman, she\u2019s a senior now) was in a class with my freshman daughter. He helped her a few times and again the whole family has known him for almost 4 years, she saw that my younger daughter sent him a couple messages in a field trip and made a huge loud ordeal about \u201cwhy are you messaging a freshman\u201d and basically made it seem like it was weird and embarrassed him enough to block the younger daughter. I was horrified by what she did to the both of them! There was nothing \u201cweird\u201d about it at all. I told her she probably lost a friend but she kept justifying herself saying she was just asking etc. ironically I haven\u2019t heard about him since\u2026.no big fall out he just kinda ghosted her.

Ended up making my best friends at that table, many of who I am still friends with today at 28. Liked art, so joined the art club and made some other friends. Mileage may very, but I think part of growing up is learning to put yourself out there and find your own path in life.

You cant force friendships  and you can't force siblings to hang out. That creates resentment. NTA", "I can kind of see both sides of it. Sometimes, older siblings don't want their little siblings tagging along, and school might be one of the only places where she can do her own thing with her own friends.\n\nAdditionally, if her friends don't know little sis, then sitting at the table with them could be awkward and uncomfortable for all involved, but especially little sis. She might not even *want* to sit there, even if big sis extended the invitation.\n\nI think this is something they have to figure out between themselves. It all depends on what their dynamic is with each other.", "So you thing forcing people into a situation that they're uncomfortable in is kindness? Emily is younger, an introvert and has no common interests with her sister and her friends. Nowhere in the post does it say Emily wants to sit with her sister, just that dad tried to force it and Emily is upset about being alone without her friend. Is Emily going to feel better if she's sat with others but no-ones talking to her since she can't associate with their conversations? Or if everyone sits in silence because they don't want to exclude her in conversations but don't know her interests well so don't say anything? I grew up with a less popular sibling and them trying to force the self on me and my friends nearly ruined friendships because they didn't like my sibling because they had no common interests and sometimes had boundary issues, but didn't want to be mean by saying anything so they made me tell my sibling to go away, I tried to be polite but my sibling called me a liar and accused me of bullying, alienating them, turning my friends against them and being selfish.

Places like pottery painting cafes, etc might be somewhere to meet people. She could also go online and look for likeminded individuals, swap ideas and get tips. She could get into designing her own things using a programme like tinkerCAD or similar, does her school have a design and technology workshop?\n\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a hopeless situation, she doesn\u2019t have way out there hobbies, just niche ones.

That\u2019s a better batting average than lots of parents but still shows room for improvement.", "i completely agree wi8th you,  people like to think it'd be sunshines and rainbows but the truth is it wont. it could be good for them or it could cause them to never want to interact, i dont talk to my sister and i live in the same house, you cant force people to get along regardless of if they're family.\n\nemily needs to find her own way, its shit but we've all done it. if she cant shes gonna grow up to be reclusive and dependant on her sister for company. its exactly why my sister and i dont get on, it makes them strange.", "They don't have to. If they saw their siblings all alone they would have hung out with her until she could find friends. Then they can drift off in their own circles. I don't understand your logic.", "I didn\u2019t know anyone who spent every lunch with their siblings either. Even though most of the time we would be doing our own thing there was plenty of overlap or someone going to another table, chat with their friend group. Especially if like one of us had a breakup or friend drama or shit going on at home that was usually the more reason for us to kinda pop in at lunch, passing period, etc.", "See, I think by 16, popularity had shifted from focusing around how cool someone was or what they wore and a lot more on people\u2019s personality. I definitely noticed a huge difference in the way people acted towards each other when they were around 14-15 - it was similar to the way people treat peers in uni or the workplace.\n\n\nI definitely think dad was out of line by getting upset, but I don\u2019t blame him for being disappointed. You can never make someone popular or force friendships, but you can certainly ease their burden of being completely isolated.\n\n\nI mentioned past history as I know there are parents who expect their kids to invite their less socially-competent siblings to every social event and expect them to always share friends. That\u2019s an unreasonable expectation and crushes a kid\u2019s independence. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.", "[removed]", "She can have empathy for her sister without doing this.  This will only create more problems and will not help anything.", "I don\u2019t know what you want from Cindy, she can still feel bad for her and not want her near her friends", "Why is it terrible? Based on the small snippet of information op included, it doesn\u2019t sound like the girls have shared hobbies/interest. I don\u2019t think it shows a lack of empathy to not invite someone who doesn\u2019t have shared hobbies/interests with you. They live together\u2026it\u2019s not like their is a shortage on spending time together. If anything, I think it\u2019s a good talking point that the little sister is in a phase where she needs to discover her own hobbies and interests and make friends that align with them. Not glom on to her sister and friends  when likely all the little sister would be doing is sitting there quietly not participating in conversation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d that a 16 year old is putting her friends above family, pretty normal at that age. She\u2019s finding her own way.", "Agreed. Certainly sounds like OP favors Cindy over Emily. I don't see any compassion for Emily in the post; just concern that Cindy's popularity isn't affected. \n\nIf Cindy loses a friend because she included her sister at the lunch table, is that the type of friend that Cindy should care about? \n\nAnd what the hell does \"even worse they talk about something sensitive in the group & Emily uses it in a future argument\" even mean? Do these girls fight often? What would even be discussed over lunch that Emily could bring up? \n\nIT'S LUNCH AT HIGH SCHOOL. It's not parties on the weekend and every social event. The compassionate thing for Cindy to do would be to explain to her friends that her younger sister is having a hard time & could she sit with them at lunch until she makes some friends her own age? \n\nOP - the other thing that really bothers me about your post & your defense of Cindy is the lack of concern about what this could do to Cindy & Emily's relationship long-term. Cindy has the opportunity to be a compassionate big sister & is choosing not to be. Hopefully, this doesn't drive a permanent wedge between them. Family should be more important that high school popularity contests. \n\nYTA.", "It won\u2019t give her a safe space though, most likely set up for her being ignored by the friend group or Cindy taking heat. Not a safe space", "That genuinely sounds nice and I\u2019m happy that you had that high school experience. Most of the girls I knew in high school and the women I\u2019ve known since did not have that kind of sibling relationship.", ">See, I think by 16, popularity had shifted from focusing around how cool someone was or what they wore and a lot more on people\u2019s personality.\n\nThis is where I definitely agree on your earlier point about cultural (or subcultural) differences. I knew plenty of people at 16 who were moving away from the more superficial factors of whether or not they liked a person, but I also know a lot at 29 who never moved past that at all. That's not to mention the fact that the older sister probably has a better idea of the root cause of her sister's social issues than her parents do, and she probably has a better insight on why her sister had a falling out with her best friend and she may well be afraid that this will quickly become a case where her sister **does** want to tag along to every event. It also doesn't do anything to resolve the underlying issue that the younger sister has trouble making friends. Either way I don't think the mom or the older sister are assholes here... I don't even think that the father or the younger sister are either, just that they have unrealistic expectations for a teenager who probably feels like their social success is balanced on a razor's edge.", "No need to take anything personal here, I was just confused because you seemed to be responding to me when I was talking to someone else. Cheers", "i dont see how she can have empathy for her sister in this. \n\nsitting by yourself at lunch is lonely and embarrassing in public high school", "I want nothing from Cindy, I'm only saying it sounds like she has no empathy at all, and OP is fostering more resentment in their relationship. \n\nMy sister and I aren't close, never have been, but neither one of us would have let the other sit alone without friends, because my parents raised us to show compassion for each other and other people.", "Neither of us had a good high school experience but I guess this post kind of made me realize having each other there was probably one of the better parts about it. So thank you for that? lol \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc I hope you and your friends had the opportunity to get closer to your siblings with age.", "That definitely may be the case! Whilst there\u2019ll always be exceptions to the rule, as a 29 year-old, there\u2019s very few people my age (in my experience) who care about the superficial aspects of others they socialise with. When I\u2019ve bumped into people from school, a huge proportion have apologised for their behaviour 11-13, which is actually kind of adorable! \n\n\nYeah, I hesitate to call OP or her eldest an AH, but I think they\u2019re teetering on the edge. The same applies to dad, as I imagine he was horrified and didn\u2019t act perfectly as a result. \n\n\n\nIf it is a one-off event, I would implore OP to have a non-judgemental conversation with her oldest to find out why she\u2019s concerned about inviting her youngest sister to sit over. It could be that the older sister had concerning attitudes towards socialisation (which could range from: \u201cew, my sister is goth/gay/gross), or (more likely) she could have concerns about boundaries, independence, and feeling comfortable. Nonetheless, it seems worth a chat so that further understanding could be reached by everyone.", "Oh really, damn. Didn't realise you were so objective before to come back with that after couple of cheap taunts and kind of immature conjectures you drew just to spark an argument for argument sake.", "Aww! Yes, my sister and I have definitely grown a lot closer with age and enjoy spending time together whenever we can. I think a lot of adult siblings are like that.", ">Yeah, I hesitate to call OP or her eldest an AH, but I think they\u2019re teetering on the edge. The same applies to dad, as I imagine he was horrified and didn\u2019t act perfectly as a result.\n\nAgreed, it's either a light ESH or a strong NAH. Either way I appreciate the fresh perspective so thank you :)", "Questioning whether or not you've ever spoken to a teenager **after** you expected a hormonal 16 year old to be \"level headed\" is a taunt lol? Have a good one mate, I'm clearly not going to make any headway here."]}
