I'm coming at this from the bias of the older sibling who was forced to have the younger one hang out with my friend group every summer holiday - \"you can't go with your friends unless you take your brother\" was a frequent reply from our mother. It was awful.\n\n\nI hated him. Truly hated. He was immature and would make up shit that caused problems with my friends to sound \"cool\". If I tried to pull him into line he'd run back to our mother to cry about how awful I was. What finally put an end to it was the day the group split in half; the stronger swimmers went out to the beach including me. I told my bro to go with the crew playing soccer, but he refused. He was 14 and almost drowned when he got caught in a rip tide. He was damn lucky I spotted him in time to save him. It nearly took out both of us and I honestly hated him even more for nearly killing us both JUST to prove he was popular with my friends - which he wasn't.\n\n\nForcing a relationship that doesn't exist is going to breed resentment that will show up in different ways and possibly destroy their chance at an adult relationship.

She is not responsible for Emily, and her dad should not demand anything from her.\n\nThat being said. Don't stop parenting Emily just because you cannot directly fix the situation. Explore with her mentor if it's possible for the school to mediate between her and Beth. Or if the mentor knows any likely friend candidates, and if they can do a project together. Explore if there is social skills training available for Emily to up her game. Explore if there are lunch time activities at the school. Explore if there are hobby clubs so she at least has some form of friends, even if they cannot sit together at lunch. Ask her if she knows how to make friends, and talk through the steps.

Now Cindy is quite popular, she is on the volleyball team and has a huge friend group. My youngest isn\u2019t very popular and her friend (Beth) is her main friend or ex friend. It also doesn\u2019t help that she is into hobbies most other high schoolers don\u2019t care about.\n\n\nEmily and Beth got into a fight and Beth is not speaking to her anymore. She is sitting alone at lunch now. This came out yesterday and my husband wants Cindy to invite her to sit with her group of friends at the \u201cpopular table\u201d. Cindy refused saying she doesn\u2019t want to do that. \n\nMy husband was mad but when he tried to get me to back him up I told him Cindy has ever right to not want her little sister in her friend group. That you can\u2019t do that do her and Emiliy needs to make her own friends.\n\nMy husband is pissed at me and Cindy. Emilie is super upset that she doesn\u2019t have people to eat with and I am wondering if I made the right call or if I am being a jerk.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Especially is the 16yr olds feel too uncomfortable to talk about friend things in front of her (making plans, personal matters, etc). \n\nI had some friends of differing ages in school but my school was quite large so we mostly just hung out with our own grades, so it might be different for others but to me, a bunch of 16yr olds being somewhat forced to sit with a younger 14yr old is not a great starting point. Especially if the sisters aren\u2019t friends already.\n\nWhen I was 12-14yrs old I had many lunches where I had to awkwardly eat alone. I brought a book (I love books) to try and make it seem okay to others. It forced me to make new friends. I shoe horned my way into sitting with some people when I was 15. I made excuses for a couple days until it felt somewhat natural for me to just sit there. And then we became great friends. She\u2019s just gotta get out there.", "NTA.

In addition it will strain her sister\u2019s relationships.", "NTA\n\nThey are two years apart. It would be very forced to have Emily sit with Cindy under duress.\n\nYou need to help Emily develop her social skills. She needs to nurture prospective friendships and is likely very shy.

However once she went off to college and we were no longer living under the same roof we started to become closer and now we\u2019re great friends and we talk on the phone all the time. I think had our parents tried to force us to be friends when we were in middle/high school that would\u2019ve caused some serious resentment between us that would have prevented us from being as close as we are now. But because they gave us room to be our own people and to grow separately that allowed us to bond later in life and have the great relationship that we have now. So while I understand your husbands desire to help his little girl and to not want her to be lonely I think forcing your daughters to be friends now will prevent them from actually being friends in the future", "It's not just that Emily needs to find her own way - it's that there's a world of difference between their ages right now, in social groups.

Maybe you could encourage Cindy to go and sit with Emily, just the two of them, one day during lunch. That way Emily can have some company and feel the support of her sister, and Cindy doesn't have to feel awkward with her sister and friends mingling together inorganically. \n\nSo you know where I'm coming from, I am the older sister to one younger sister. We're all grown now. Even though there were so many times I found her annoying as hell, at the end of the day, she's still my sister, and I've always been very protective of her.

The only fair way Cindy or any of her friends should introduce anyone else to the table is to ask everyone else if it would be alright.

Cindy is 16 & Emily is 14 as well. That\u2019s likely junior vs freshman. Dynamics in high school are hard. Does the school have a counselor she can turn to? Or a favorite teacher?

Of course when your kids are young you want to teach them to be inclusive and not push people out but as teenagers they are old enough to choose their own friends.

If she was to go sit with them there is no doubt in my mind based on what you wrote that her sisters friends would bully her while there. More so because of the forced joining. There are very rare instances where that isn't the case, but to me it seems your children already do not get along. It will only make the gap wider between the two and make more kids at school separate from her as well.\n\nThe better answer here would be to try and get your youngest daughter to join a club at school to make new friends. Book club, yearbook, anything that interests her. \n\nForcing her to sit with others will most definitely make them not want to be her friend because that will be their first impression.

Just to let her sister know that at least, she is not invisible to her, and there by, not invisible to others.

Forcing relationships is always a terrible idea and in this case may very well damage the existing relationship between the girls. Neither kid is going to be happy about the situation at the end, because even in the best case scenario everyone will know why Emily is sitting there and she\u2019s going to either be pitied or ignored. It will come out that she has no other friends and she may end up feeling worse than if she had sat alone to eat. Kids can be brutal and you most definitely don\u2019t want Emily to experience that. \n\nBut this definitely isn\u2019t a situation in which parents need to intervene, this is a situation where you support Emily in her feelings and help her determine a plan, not make her Cindy\u2019s problem. Sometimes parents don\u2019t understand the damage they are doing when they try to force relationships to be something they are not. It\u2019s one thing to suggest to Cindy to help out her sister while she\u2019s having a hard time, because in this case you\u2019re giving her space to do it in a way that makes sense for the relationship. You can suggest Cindy  talk to her sister (at home, most likely) or give her extra  space if that\u2019s appropriate. But ultimately this is not Cindy\u2019s issue to handle. Don\u2019t give her the responsibility of her sister\u2019s social life or she will absolutely grow to resent her.", "If it hasn't been suggested already, there's a compromise solution - Cindy could stop at the popular table, say hi to her friends, then say \"my sister is having a hard time right now, I'm going to have lunch with her\", then spend some time with her sister.  Doesn't have to be every day.  Her friend group will get it, even assume that parents are making her.  IF they are not total mean girls, they will think its the right thing too.  IF they are, they'll still assume its under parental threat.  So no loss of rep.\n\nAges for high school can be misleading - but it looks like Junior and Freshman?  If so, Junior could also help Freshman find some school clubs that might be interesting to her.", "You are kind of being a jerk!

Your husband has slightly misguided but good intent, and at least is making a suggestion. You are quick to defend your older daughter, but offer nothing about your younger daughter other than justifying her not fitting in. \n\nGuessing you were on a sports team and were popular. That is so fetch.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here but YTA. If your daughters like each other, she should invite her sister to sit with them. It\u2019s cruel to leave your sibling alone.

I have two young daughters, two years apart.  I have taught them that they are each other's BFF.  They are too have each other's back no matter what.  The results?  They are very loving and caring to each other.  They protect each other.  And they are very much individuals with their own friends and hobbies as well as having some mutual friends together.  They do have disagreements but that is where me, as the parent, teaches them about compromise and solutions.

Kids like that are a dime a dozen. You should want your daughter(s) to be worth far more.\n\nCindy understandably wants her independence, but she can absolutely maintain that while taking time to help her sister in small, but significant ways. Love is messy and inconvenient, but well worth the time and effort. You will find no greater investment in life than unconditional love. Providing a refuge for Emily at lunch time is something a kind and secure older sister would do. Emily could even just sit nearby and read a book or knit within earshot and occasionally be included in conversations. \n\nCindy's friends in no way have to be Emily's friends, but what a good example she could set for them by being a leader and going out of her way to include her sister somehow. It won't be forever...just until she gets firmer social footing again. Introverts will further sink into their shell in these cases, so it's great to keep tugging on them a bit until they get their momentum going again.", "INFO: Is your younger daughter bullied and how involved is your older daughter in said activity? It sounds like your younger daughter is really struggling and like you don't care at all.

Seriously disturbing that you're ok with that and that you've raised her this way. Popularity and social hierarchy are a bunch of BS and outside in the real world after you graduate it doesn't matter if you were popular in high school. But it does matter how you treat your own family. Smh. I'm just SO disgusted and angry about this whole situation. Do better.

I think you and the big sister are jerks to let her have no friends until hopefully someone comes to the school. And bring her into her friends doesn't mean she can't find friends outside her sister's friends it might open her up to be more friendly. Like the big sister can find and will find friends outside this school friend group. And the only real friend the big sister has beside the best friend is a lil sister. Maybe you should start trying to get them to become friends now when they are young instead of waiting when they are adults and estranged from each other and you're worried why aren't they closer. We obviously don't want nor think the lil sister will take over the big sister's friend group but the big sister can protect her from feeling like a outsider and someone takes advantage of her because of her feelings. The big sister can be the great big sister who her friends are great and welcome her sister in or have fake friends that will be mean to her lil sister and stop hanging out with the big sister. I would ask to your oldest if she has great friends, talk to her about why she doesn't want her lil sister in her friend group, try to convince her to invite her, for them to try to get to know each other, and find similar things they both like. I don't know you're kids and if forcing won't make things worse in their relationship because if the big sister doesn't want her lil sister around her friends that is telling and someone need to look into that. Because I have a older sister and we never was in the same school together but I know she would do this to me because she had a problem with me because I became the baby and she wasn't anymore. But if it was my lil sister I would love to bring her into my group as long as she is not a messy person who will do things behind my back to mess up my place in the group or the group as a whole. And if the lil sister is like that then both you and big sister NTA. If not than would your oldest want the same treatment if the roles were reversed? No matter the answer talk to Emily about this hypothetically to see if she would want it because she might not want to sit with her sister and her friends.

She couldnt really fit in, we were older, but we just painted her nails. Cus why not.\n\nI was a teenager once, and angsty one at that. So dont tell me about being a teen. You're too funny. I've seen plenty of siblings not being ok to exclude or leave their sibling a loner in the same school or get bullied, because its also a pride thing. Different family values and morals i guess.\n\nI mean my own husband used to pick his own sister up from school even when she was a teen and was sick. Ironic, they HATED each other so much, but when it came to important stuff, he NEVER left her alone.\n\nAnd a response to a point you missed by a MILE, sister doesnt HAVE to include her in her personal life, she can step out of it and simply keep company to her sister outside of her friend group. Its not that hard to say to friends, that she'll be keeping company to her sis that day \\^ read above example.\n\nAnd forcefully tossing your younger sister into a much older group is like tossing a helpless sheep to the wolves.

Where do you think i got education? A barn?", "That would be a failing of the older sister. In his best man speech my brother talked about how when a bully my age hit him in the face with a snowball, the next thing he saw was me flying in the air having launched myself at the kid.

He helped her a few times and again the whole family has known him for almost 4 years, she saw that my younger daughter sent him a couple messages in a field trip and made a huge loud ordeal about \u201cwhy are you messaging a freshman\u201d and basically made it seem like it was weird and embarrassed him enough to block the younger daughter. I was horrified by what she did to the both of them! There was nothing \u201cweird\u201d about it at all.

Sometimes, older siblings don't want their little siblings tagging along, and school might be one of the only places where she can do her own thing with her own friends.\n\nAdditionally, if her friends don't know little sis, then sitting at the table with them could be awkward and uncomfortable for all involved, but especially little sis.

It all depends on what their dynamic is with each other.", "So you thing forcing people into a situation that they're uncomfortable in is kindness? Emily is younger, an introvert and has no common interests with her sister and her friends. Nowhere in the post does it say Emily wants to sit with her sister, just that dad tried to force it and Emily is upset about being alone without her friend. Is Emily going to feel better if she's sat with others but no-ones talking to her since she can't associate with their conversations? Or if everyone sits in silence because they don't want to exclude her in conversations but don't know her interests well so don't say anything? I grew up with a less popular sibling and them trying to force the self on me and my friends nearly ruined friendships because they didn't like my sibling because they had no common interests and sometimes had boundary issues, but didn't want to be mean by saying anything so they made me tell my sibling to go away, I tried to be polite but my sibling called me a liar and accused me of bullying, alienating them, turning my friends against them and being selfish.

That\u2019s a better batting average than lots of parents but still shows room for improvement.", "i completely agree wi8th you,  people like to think it'd be sunshines and rainbows but the truth is it wont. it could be good for them or it could cause them to never want to interact, i dont talk to my sister and i live in the same house, you cant force people to get along regardless of if they're family.\n\nemily needs to find her own way, its shit but we've all done it. if she cant shes gonna grow up to be reclusive and dependant on her sister for company. its exactly why my sister and i dont get on, it makes them strange.", "They don't have to. If they saw their siblings all alone they would have hung out with her until she could find friends. Then they can drift off in their own circles. I don't understand your logic.", "I didn\u2019t know anyone who spent every lunch with their siblings either. Even though most of the time we would be doing our own thing there was plenty of overlap or someone going to another table, chat with their friend group.

I definitely noticed a huge difference in the way people acted towards each other when they were around 14-15 - it was similar to the way people treat peers in uni or the workplace.\n\n\nI definitely think dad was out of line by getting upset, but I don\u2019t blame him for being disappointed. You can never make someone popular or force friendships, but you can certainly ease their burden of being completely isolated.\n\n\nI mentioned past history as I know there are parents who expect their kids to invite their less socially-competent siblings to every social event and expect them to always share friends. That\u2019s an unreasonable expectation and crushes a kid\u2019s independence. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.", "[removed]", "She can have empathy for her sister without doing this.

They live together\u2026it\u2019s not like their is a shortage on spending time together. If anything, I think it\u2019s a good talking point that the little sister is in a phase where she needs to discover her own hobbies and interests and make friends that align with them. Not glom on to her sister and friends  when likely all the little sister would be doing is sitting there quietly not participating in conversation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d that a 16 year old is putting her friends above family, pretty normal at that age. She\u2019s finding her own way.", "Agreed. Certainly sounds like OP favors Cindy over Emily. I don't see any compassion for Emily in the post; just concern that Cindy's popularity isn't affected. \n\nIf Cindy loses a friend because she included her sister at the lunch table, is that the type of friend that Cindy should care about? \n\nAnd what the hell does \"even worse they talk about something sensitive in the group & Emily uses it in a future argument\" even mean? Do these girls fight often? What would even be discussed over lunch that Emily could bring up? \n\nIT'S LUNCH AT HIGH SCHOOL. It's not parties on the weekend and every social event. The compassionate thing for Cindy to do would be to explain to her friends that her younger sister is having a hard time & could she sit with them at lunch until she makes some friends her own age? \n\nOP - the other thing that really bothers me about your post & your defense of Cindy is the lack of concern about what this could do to Cindy & Emily's relationship long-term. Cindy has the opportunity to be a compassionate big sister & is choosing not to be. Hopefully, this doesn't drive a permanent wedge between them. Family should be more important that high school popularity contests. \n\nYTA.", "It won\u2019t give her a safe space though, most likely set up for her being ignored by the friend group or Cindy taking heat.

I knew plenty of people at 16 who were moving away from the more superficial factors of whether or not they liked a person, but I also know a lot at 29 who never moved past that at all. That's not to mention the fact that the older sister probably has a better idea of the root cause of her sister's social issues than her parents do, and she probably has a better insight on why her sister had a falling out with her best friend and she may well be afraid that this will quickly become a case where her sister **does** want to tag along to every event. It also doesn't do anything to resolve the underlying issue that the younger sister has trouble making friends. Either way I don't think the mom or the older sister are assholes here... I don't even think that the father or the younger sister are either, just that they have unrealistic expectations for a teenager who probably feels like their social success is balanced on a razor's edge.", "No need to take anything personal here, I was just confused because you seemed to be responding to me when I was talking to someone else.

It could be that the older sister had concerning attitudes towards socialisation (which could range from: \u201cew, my sister is goth/gay/gross), or (more likely) she could have concerns about boundaries, independence, and feeling comfortable. Nonetheless, it seems worth a chat so that further understanding could be reached by everyone.", "Oh really, damn. Didn't realise you were so objective before to come back with that after couple of cheap taunts and kind of immature conjectures you drew just to spark an argument for argument sake.", "Aww!

Now as adults they are all friends together with their old high school friends even though some of my sons live elsewhere now they get together a few times of year with old friends.  I think the older daughter sounds like your stereotypical \u201cmean\u201d girl if she has no empathy for her sister losing her lunch buddy.

Would she loose coolness points?  \n\nMaybe \"Cindy\" should think about somebody else besides herself for a chance?!", "I think youre right about not forcing them, but at the very least you should have a conversation with your oldest about having a little empathy and about not being one of ~those~ girls. Popular in highschool does not mean popular for life. With all the drama in highschool, it takes one little scandle or embarrassment for that pedestal to fall, and what would happen if your daughter was to fall off of hers? Would Emily do the same thing? Ignore her sister and leave her to eat alone? Like I said, you cant force someone her age to include her sister, but you need to have a talk about empathy and about how to treat someone you love when you see them so sad. Im not saying your oldest should be holding her hand, but I am surprised that she doesnt acknowledge your daughter at all. I knew several siblings growing up in highschool. A lot of them were the types to fight like cats and dogs, but when it came down to it, you better not say something mean to the sibling or youre asking for hell to be brought down. Even my own kids.. they arent in highschool yet, but they go to the same school a couple of grades away from each other. They fight a LOT and terribly, but if someone else comes at one or the other, theyve got each others back. My best friend and her sister would fight so bad that the neighbors called the cops on them once, thinking one of them was being murdered at the house when their parents were gone. They didnt have the same friend group in high school, but they still kicked the crap out of anyone who said anything bad to the other. They are in a fight right now (as adults) and i just agree with everything my friend says because I know damn well if i started running my mouth with my own opinion she would get super upset because you dont talk about someones sister like that.", "I would hate to have a mom like this.. love for dad!!!", "YTA.

It's a good lesson to learn for Cindy because if any of her friends judge her for allowing her sister to sit with them so she's not alone then they're not friends worth having.

How sweet your husband thinks he is best to gauge teenage girl dynamics. Cute. Anyway, if your youngest wants someone to eat with, the answer is to find kids with similar interests.

I had a fight with my friend group in high school and had to sit alone at lunch.

No one will be doing her any favors if they cover for her by forcing her into a social group using someone else's social cache.  You are only going to prolong the issue, and possibly make it worse, at a time when she is best placed to address it (she's laterally forced to spend most of her days with similarly aged peers). She'll never have a better time to learn social skills than in school.

That doesn't necessarily mean I'd do what they wanted me to do, but I'd be looking to address the root of the problem and offering my support. \n\nYou and your husband need to figure out the root of Emily's friendlessness, and just chalking it up to her being different is poor parenting, and letting her struggle with acknowledging, let alone helping her is not OK. Once you have figured out the root, you can begin to help her address it and make sure Cindy knows how she can \"do her part\" whatever that may be and make sure Cindy actually does it.

He drove me to school but he still didn't want people seeing us walk in together because I was an embarassment. That is what Cindy is teaching your younger daughter. That she embarasses her. That her presence is so bad to her status that Emily should just eat alone, not even caring how that might affect Emily's status! Sure emily needs to make her own friends. That will come with time.

But I can't believe that your daughter sees her sister sitting alone, and doesn't do anything. I agree that Emily needs her own friends, but clearly she is struggling. I sat alone many times in middleschool/highschool because I was shy. It feels so embarrassing and shitty. Telling her to just suck it up is a dick move when her sister could easily support her. I can't imagine making my sister sit alone at lunch because I'm too cool for that. Letting her sit with them at lunch does not mean she's automatically in the friend group, and it doesn't mean it has to be forever.

The girl who won homecoming queen was also in marching band and almost all the popular kids were AP students or what society would generally deem nerds. Which wasn\u2019t cool back in the 90\u2019s. I was super quiet and only had a few friends, but I was only bullied once by a kid that everyone knew acted out because his home life was so shit. \n\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember if we had anyone that was ostracized and the only one I can even think of is the girl who was the weird kid. No one ever bullied her like you\u2019d see in movies, and people were nice to her face, but no one was really friends with her either and we all talked about how weird she was. \n\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m 100% sure she was sexually abused by at least one of her family members. She always had insect bites all over her like she slept outside and there were several incidents where she masturbated in class under a blanket when we were like 13 or 14. Her parents started going to the same church as us and there were a couple of times where the mom was inappropriately touchy with the kids our age, and her dad and older brother set off my creep alarm with the way they looked at us and were always making excuses to hug the teenage girls. It was a Southern Baptist church, so of course no one ever did anything but rug sweep.\n\n\nWow, that was a ramble. I just haven\u2019t thought about her in years and I still feel a lot of guilt for not realizing what was probably happening and trying to help.", "Right, by the time my brother and his friends graduated I had my own friends but having that support and just knowing ppl my first two years was such a huge blessing", "I'm the old lady in one knitting group and young knitters are welcome. Sharing the craft is more important than age. Of course, that doesn't help have someone at the lunch table.", "I remember a few years back it an older woman pointed out to me that it had become normal to see younger people knitting and crocheting. A friend and I would crochet on our lunch break. No convo needed. That was the only job I'd actually take a full hour at.", "Have her look into [Project Linus](https://www.projectlinus.org/). They are always looking for volunteers to knit/crochet/quilt blankets for kids in need.", "Old ladies can be fucking funny as hell sometimes and usually have awesome stories about their lives", "I don't think anyone should be forced for exactly this reason.  But if my sister were alone and lonely, I'd want to sit with her once in a while.  Not every day.  Not at the expense of my own friends.  But bc I loved her and I know how hard it is to be all alone.", "Also, it doesn't even have to be everyday, just a couple times a week would be decent.", "Same I was alone on a hill litterally at lunch all freshmen yr until my senior yr cousin introduced me to his group. We were a multi yr oddball group but by my senior yr the popular asshole who trash talked me while shooting me down for girls ask the guys dance  asked me to prom.", "It's funny but that was 100% the case at the school I actually ended up attending, but at another that I only went to for a few weeks popularity seemed to be primarily based upon hate and violence. It was awful. The place I transferred to was so much nicer that the earlier one didn't even feel real.", "Popular is synonymous with likeable. Doesn't mean they are actually nice.  I was a senior in 2005 \n\nYa we had the antisocial jerk table too but those are not the \" likeable jerks\" the ones who are sociable.", "My friends all fell out with each other the last year of high school.\n\nI didn't pick a side and my punishment was no friends.\n\nI'd go for a walk (around the school), eat outside, try out various lunch clubs or go to one of the classrooms that would let you do arts or crafts.\n\nNo need to sit alone at a lunch table", "At the high school where I teach, there's a knitting club that's well attended. It's been around for about three years or so. All types of students join."]}
