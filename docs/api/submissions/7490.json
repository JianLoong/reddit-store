They explicitly said that it would just be us, as my sister\u2019s family (BIL and 2 young kids around 5 and 2) would be too difficult to travel with. Of course, we all love the young kids, but traveling with young kids changes things (you go to different places, focus changes, more people to wrangle, etc.). My sister also travels with my parents a lot more than we do, due to our work. This trip sounds like a nice opportunity for us to spend quality time with just my parents, as well as to do more adult-oriented activities.\n\nOkay, so that sounds fine. My parents are graciously paying for everything. My wife and I requested time off work (~10 days). Then\u2026 for some unknown reason, after explicitly saying that my sister\u2019s family would be too much for this trip, they have now been invited. And of course, everything is changing. Now certain things we are eyeing are not going to be considered because of the kids, and all activities now must factor in the kids. We were going to have lots of time with just my parents, as well as plenty of time to explore on our own. Now, however, with the kids going, my parents\u2019 focus will be entirely on the kids. We are routinely ignored during any meal or outing involving their grandkids. \n\nThis feels like a huge bait-and-switch for my SO and me. We joined the trip under certain conditions, and now things are vastly different. It\u2019s a lot of time to request off, and now that the trip has shifted focus, we feel like it\u2019s not worth it. However, it is being paid for by my parents, so we don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful. We don\u2019t feel like we will get the quality time we expected, nor will we get the opportunity to do many activities we expected.\n\nSo\u2026 WIBTA if I said that we aren\u2019t going to go on this trip? I\u2019m sure that we\u2019d put it in a tactful way, but this just seems like everything that the trip was supposed to be has changed.\n\nEdit: minor typo", "created_utc": 1673879449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dfyhs/wibta_for_wanting_to_not_go_on_vacation_with/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they are unwilling to listen to your concerns, then they\u2019ve made their decision and you know where you stand.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated bc someone else is paying. You agreed to one trip, they have now made it another. Don\u2019t waste the significant time off if you feel you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or not enjoy.", "NTA. The conditions of the trip have changed and you\u2019re no longer interested.", "NTA. You were invited to go on a trip with four adults. They changed plans without consulting you. You were invited under false pretenses and have every right not to want to spend your vacation on a trip centered around children that aren\u2019t yours.", "Nta.  I can't stand my sister. My parents pulled this same vacation crap on me trying  to get me to see my sister.  I refused to go. They never tried that again.", "NTA, you said you would go on the trip under certain expectations.  The situation has now changed by no fault of your own.  If you were specifically told that your sister and family would not be joining, I'm not sure why things have now changed.  Definitely be tactful if you do back out, hopefully they will understand.", "NTA. They told you this would be a trip just for you and them, and confirmed your sister and her family wouldn't be coming because it would be too difficult. That is the trip you agreed to come on. Now that your sister's family is coming, the trip has completely changed, and is now going to be \"too difficult\" for everyone involved. You need to tell them asap though. Just tell them you were looking forward to spending time with them alone and for an adult oriented trip, which was the initial premise. And that given it's turned into a trip geared towards the kids, which they admitted was going to be difficult, you would rather take a separate vacation with them at another time. If you can't put back your vacation days, go on a trip alone with your SO to somewhere you both want to go.", "NTA This does seem like a bait & switch!!!  Have you expressed to your parents that you sort of wanted to \"be selfish\" for this trip because they usually vacation with others and grands and were looking forward to \"grown up\" activities with them all to yourself... I think that's how I would phrase it, \"I really need the bonding time with parents for MY sake, and need grown up activities to relax because face it, kids on a vacation make it uncomfortable for all, especially me, I can't relax with the kids around all the time\"  \n\nYou are not wrong to feel this way, everything you stated is totally valid. Tell them you do feel hurt because they DO spend more time/vacation with sibling/grandkids. Ask them why they are favoring sibling? Ask them if it's possible to go on even a short trip with just the four of you... Make sure to REHEARSE your talking points first so it does not devolve into an arguement, when I pick my battles I always rehearse for a few days to get my point across. It has really helped me to \"discuss/argue\" better because I can stay calm and focus on the specific issue at hand, share my points and feelings and hurts then sometimes I just walk away  so there is time for the other party to digest the whole thing.\n\nI don't know if your folks will respond positively or not, what do YOU THINK they will do? If sibling is the golden child, you are probably not going to get a great response from them...\n\nGood luck, I do hope you can get some quality time with your folks.", "NTA. They changed the conditions without even asking you. Your time is valuable so they shouldn't expect you to use it on something you don't really want. Their payment is irrelevant - it's not what you agreed to.", "YWNBTA. But it wasn\u2019t a bait and switch. They caved in to your sister. It\u2019s a completely new trip with kids.", "NTA. Did your parents gladly change plans, or did your sister find out and pressure them to include her family, change plans, etc? Either is wrong, but that would influence my thoughts on how to respond. But do not go if you won\u2019t enjoy it. No guilt.", "NTA or maybe N A H. Everything you\u2019ve pointed out about the young kids changing the scope of the trip is true. I also agree, though, that you\u2019ll need to word your backing out tactfully. Since your parents are paying for the trip, they\u2019re fully within their right to change their minds about how the trip will go.", "ESH...your parents for changing the details and who was going on the trip. You tooks a lot of time off and you were expecting an adult trip. And you (kinda) for bailing on the trip. Sit down with your parents and tell them your concerns. See if there are some activities that your sibling and fam can do on their own or things you can do without them. I can't think of many people who would prefer to do \"kid things\" if they don't have kids (Disney aside).

That's highly challenging to do when traveling with young children (unless there are several other adults helping 24/7 in shifts so everyone gets a break). \n\nDefinitely have a conversation with your parents about the addition of the children to the trip. See if your parents will agree to at least one day of the trip being devoted to everyone doing their own thing and incorporating at least 3 hours on the other days of the trip for each person to pick something they want to do with the group (including the children). If no one is willing to seriously commit to this compromise, you should decline from going on the trip and tell them you would love to plan something together with them in the future.

You're right; this would be very ungrateful.", "NTA Perhaps speak to your parents about a compromise. Maybe a shorter trip can be taken with just the adults.

I think you can find a way to talk to your parents.", "You would NOT be the AH here unless things were already paid for and you made them lose out on the money.", "They have changed the plans so you are NTA for changing your plans and not wasting vacation time on something you don't want to do.", " NTA- not everyone likes to travel with kids and you agreed to the trip because it was going to be just the 4 of you. \n\nDepending on where you\u2019re going\u2026 would it be possible to go and then be able to do your own thing away from the kids?", "Nta. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for wanting your own personal vacation days from work to be used on enjoyable activities that spark your interest. You\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting to deal with whiny kids who need a nap because the child friendly activities kept them out too long.", "NTA. If you do not want to go, it\u2019s ok to say no.", "No, not the a-hole.  I wouldn't go either. I mean it sounds like you haven't even left yet and like you said everything's already changing before anybody even arrives to the vacation? ...good Lord.  And plus why would they say she wasn't invited and but then somehow invite her that's so weird.", "Oh, I would guilt them so hard about having looked forward to so much quality time with just parents and how disappointed I am that they chose to change the trip."]}
