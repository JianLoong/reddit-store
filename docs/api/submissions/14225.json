Wait staff does the orders, kitchen cooks and manager MANAGES the restaurant and with that comes handling customers. You couldn't go and tell them yourself and you lied even you could just be honest that you dont open the door OR you could just open the door. Now you ruined your customer's mood and evening and they probably wont even come back.\n\nmy SO has been a manager in the restaurant business for 12 years. I read him the story and he said he would have just opened up for them. In the restaurant business you have so many customers who suck up to the managers and act entitled but their are professional ways to handle it but you cant just give your staff the responsibility.
