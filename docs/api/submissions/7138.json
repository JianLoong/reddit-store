Something like this:\n\n\"MIL, FIL, I'm/we're very distressed and confused by this whole business, and clearly there has been a major miscommunication somewhere along the line, so we want to set the record straight once and for all. My name is not Katherine. It never has been. I'm not sure where you got the idea that it was - whether you misunderstood that my name was a nickname, or simply don't approve of the name that my parents gave me and have unilaterally decided to give me a different one of your choosing - but the name on my birth certificate is, in fact, Rynn. Spelled R-Y-N-N. It is not short for anything, including Katherine. I have never been named Katherine. And it is deeply distressing to me that you have persisted for YEARS in not only calling me the wrong name, but introducing and referring to me in conversation with others as a name that is not mine and never has been. You have called me rude when I have attempted to correct you, but the truth is that is not ONLY rude, but DEEPLY HURTFUL that you have doggedly insisted on renaming me, not only to my face but when you introduce me to new people, as though my actual name, given to me by my loving parents, were somehow offensive to you. At this point there is no pretending that what you are doing is accidental or forgetfulness. It is clearly deliberate, it is shockingly presumptuous and disrespectful, and most of all, it HURTS MY FEELINGS TERRIBLY.\n\n\"Going forward, we're going to have to insist that you call me by my correct name - RYNN - that you introduce me as such, that when people ask you my name that you give them the right one, which is not and has never been Katherine. If you cannot do this, then I'm afraid that for my own well-being and peace-of-mind I will have to take steps to correct you, often and publicly, and/or cut ties with you, since your persistent unkindness is becoming genuinely problematic.\" \n\nYou are NTA, and your in-laws are being outrageously inappropriate. And you shouldn't have had to put up with it this long. But it's time to stop correcting them on the fly, sit them down, and give them one last, hardcore lecture . . . and then stick to that boundary!!", "NTA they are intentionally insulting you", "NTA, they deserve to be embarrassed.", "NTA! It\u2019s YOUR name and part of your identity. It\u2019s also great that your husband is fully on your side and that others laughed about it at the party. Hopefully your IL\u2019s start to call you by your name, but if not maybe you can continue to joke about it until they hopefully begin to laugh about it themselves and realize that their issue with your name is silly?\n\nNow hear me out. My name is Natalia, but I\u2019m often accidentally called Natalie or Natasha. I\u2019ll politely inform the person of the mispronunciation and usually I don\u2019t have to remind them again. However, the grandmother of my partner of 15 years never once called me anything except Natalie. Now English wasn\u2019t her 1st language and at first we all thought it was a language barrier, but that it was quite possible that she was insulting me. But over the years and many many many interactions my partner\u2019s parents, siblings, cousins, literally everyone corrected her on the pronunciation of my name (I never had to do it again). And each time Abuela Avila would parrot back Natalia once and then go back to calling me Natalie minute later, my name just wouldn\u2019t stick. It became a running joke in the family. Stuff like someone would call me Natalie and I\u2019d pretend I didn\u2019t know they were talking to me until they threw a pillow at me, things like that, and Abuela would laugh with the rest of us and tell us all to stop teasing. I was lucky in getting to be part of a loving silly family though and she actually did like me, was always knitting me socks.\n\nI hope that your in laws can realize how silly they\u2019re being and that they start to treat you with more respect.

Your teacher is wrong and got umlauts mixed up with diaereses. An umlaut is from German and originally was written as a letter e over another vowel and got turned into two dots because it's faster to write. It means that there's an e after the vowel. So \u00eb == ee and \u00e4 == ae, etc. \n\nHowever, umlauts don't actually exist in English. We've got another very old school spelling thing instead that is also written with two dots over a vowel but it's not an umlaut. An umlaut changes the pronunciation of the base vowel while a diaeresis indicates that the second letter should be pronounced separately when it normally wouldn't be.\n\nFor example, in German having an umlaut over an a changes the pronunciation of the letter a because it's actually an ae: a in German is pronounced \"ah\" and \u00e4 in German is pronounced closer to \"eh\". \n\nIn English, a diaeresis basically means pronounce both vowels separately when normally you would slur them together. A classic example of this is the word naive. We normally would not pronounce the a and i separately as in naive, and some publications still use the diaeresis in this word: na\u00efve. In German, an i and an \u00ef have two different pronunciations because of an umlaut. In English, an i and an \u00ef can actually have the same pronunciation. \n\nSo the name Zo\u00eb is spelled that way in English with a diaeresis to indicate that while the oe combination would normally be slurred together and the name Zoe would be pronounced Zoh, we actually want to pronounce the o and the e separately, and we end up with the pronunciation Zoh-ee.", "All I can see in my mind is that one meme of his.\n\n\"Now kith.\"", "Kathmike Kathtyson", "Kathmike Tyson", "> na\u00efve\n\nFun fact: this is the actual spelling in English and we do have the two dots over a vowel in English.
