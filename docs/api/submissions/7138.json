Her name is Beth and her teacher said \"We don't use nicknames here\" and called her Elizabeth for weeks until my grandma intervened.", "I have a quite unusual surname, like only a few hundred people with it in the country, but when I was growing up there was another, entirely separate family in the area with the same name.\n\nWhen my sister first went to school her teacher was totally convinced that there could only be one family with such an unusual name and that my sister must be related to one of the kids from the other family that they'd taught the previous year.\n\nNo matter what my sister said, the teacher would not believe they were unrelated, to the point of punishing my sister for lying. It took my mother going into the school and screaming at the teacher that she knows who her children are before they would let up about it.", "My friend has had this her whole life. Her name is Vicki, always has been, it's on her BC, but people absolutely refuse to believe she's not a Victoria. Including teachers!", "I had something like that as my given name is a very common nickname, just like Jill :)\n\nToo many people think that I need to use my PROPER name - you somehow \"can't\" have a nickname as a real name, but that has stopped more & more as the current trend of unique and unusual names has taken hold - a nickname as a proper name no longer sounds odd when people can instead complain about little Alyshia or Treyvhour.", "John's parents will be calling him Jonathan knowing full well it's not short for it.", "You got it, hell yeah!", "Not related to the post at all just curious, other than your inlaws have you had problems with your name? Your name is beautiful and may go on my list of potential names when my husband and I start trying for kids. \n\nBut for your post, NTA. Your inlaws are weird.", "Yes, some people think nicknames are for children, don't they? So I guess your in-laws rename you because they think your name is childlike? Which is really dumb and disrespectful.", "If you are petty like me, I would start calling her another similar name. She\u2019s not blank, it\u2019s actually this\u2026", "Those are popular names in my culture. Nothing wrong with them.", "Right, well, don't be jokey with the friends.  Just directly pose the question to the in laws.\n\n\"And this is my dear daughter in law, Katherine.\"\n\n\"MIL, you know my name is Rynn, and you know it's not short for Katherine.  Why do you keep telling people my name is Katherine?\"", "What? You don't say \"dramas\" the plural doesn't work like that", "It's a downvote/attention seeking account, just ignore and block them.", "I don't understand why you would tell them your name is Katherine, then, seems like just making trouble YTA", "I'm so curious, is it pronounced like HEValin and SHEValin or more just he-Evelyn/she-Evelyn", "Yeah, and then some say \"it's not a real name!\". That's what the teacher used to do as well. The first time she said that I went home to my parents and told them I was imaginary and they made me up because they wanted a kid. My parents did not like the teacher always telling me that lol.", "I didn't. I have always told them my name is Rynn. They are the ones who decided to call me Katherine.", "The latter would make more sense", "No...I can see that! It's a funny, but also sad story. That teacher was way out of line", "Is it said differently than Wren?\n\nIf so, it is so strange people are hung up on this as Wren has a pretty long history as a surname and has been used as a given name.\n\nYes they are spelled differently but the sound is not unfamiliar and most people's introductions are spoken rather than written.", "ok but tell me HEValin & SHEValin aren't fun af to say"]}
