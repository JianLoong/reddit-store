I tried to call both my mom and stepdad and got ignored so I asked Savanna if my parents were home she said \u201cyeah, why?\u201d\nI told her that I wanted to spend Easter with my mom and stepdad.\nSavanna said \u201cyour mom said no. It\u2019s not a good time. Just come over before you leave.\u201d I said that I couldn\u2019t bc I leave early in the morning. \n\nI texted my mom \u201cDon\u2019t ever expect me to come over again. You\u2019ve done it again. You\u2019ve put Savanna and the baby over your own fucking daughter. You haven\u2019t changed at all. I\u2019m sick of it. All I wanted to do was see you before I leave back to school and I can\u2019t even do that. I\u2019m so tired of it.\u201d I told my fianc\u00e9 about this and he said I\u2019m being way to harsh on my mom. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: Growing up I hardly ever had a holiday with my mom because of her addiction and tendency to put other things above her children that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hell bent on seeing her on holidays to sorta make up for lost time.\n\nEDIT 2: I feel guilty about it because she\u2019s been clean for 3-5 years and I feel like I\u2019m holding her past against but this just sent me back to when I was little sitting in the car waiting for someone who wasn\u2019t going to show up.\n\nEDIT 3: I\u2019ve spent time with my parents twice in the almost two weeks I\u2019ve been here.", "created_utc": 1681078105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gxiqh/aita_for_telling_my_mom_im_not_visiting_her/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't fathom this. My mum would be over the moon to see my brother or I. I'm so sorry you're going through this.", "NTA.

She\u2019s not trying nearly as hard as you to make up for lost time that was her fault. As a parent, I cannot even fathom not dropping everything if my kid were visiting from out of town. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re being treated this way.", "NTA - appears your mother has chosen a favourite and you have rightly walked away. If she has previous, and won't learn from the carrot, then you gotta break out the stick", "NTA. They don't seem to be putting any effort in. Stop giving when you're not receiving. Also I'm sorry that your parents suck. That's unfortunate. I'm sending internet hugs.", "NTA. Not even an issue of prioritizing--there doesn't seem to be any reason why you couldn't all be there at the same time. And it sounds like you've lodged this type of complaint with her before. She needs to show some actual effort if she plans to reconcile this.", "NTA\n\nBUT, I recommend avoiding the drama.  Just stop putting any effort into the relationship.  You are not going to make up for lost time, that is a sunk cost.  You are only going to get more hurt and disappointment.\n\nA few sessions with a therapist might help with healthier ways to make up for what you feel is missing in your life might help.

There's obviously a lot going on here. Where were you staying in your hometown if not with them in the first place?

She basically cut herself out of your life, respect her choice and stop reaching out.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your decision whether you see your mom or not. It seems as though you've expressed your disdain for her lack of effort when it comes to spending time with you, so it's understandable.", "nta, your mom and stepdad, the way you've explained it, are acting like you are not worthy of their attention or affection. This seems way outta the norm for a parent/adult child relationship. Has mental illness crept into your folks or did you burn down the whole village years back? It sounds negative and unhealthy.", "NTA. There's no reason (unless you've failed to disclose) that you couldn't be there yesterday when you're sibling was hunting eggs, or today when Savanna was there.   I'd be hurt too.", "NTA I know it\u2019s gonna be hard but you gotta say good riddance to her.  Try to seek out someone you can talk to at school about this, normally schools have counseling services of sorts that are free to help you cope with this.  If she\u2019s not gonna reach out and see you then it\u2019s not worth mending the situation. You were a kid when she struggled with addiction, it should be her trying to reach out to you to make things right.  It\u2019s not your fault your relationship with your mother isn\u2019t up to par. As for your fianc\u00e9, maybe he doesn\u2019t know the extent of the situation/relationship with your mother, as if he\u2019s had a secure and good relationship with his parents he won\u2019t be able to understand, but if he cares for you he\u2019d support you and your decision.", "NTA, it doesn't seem that she wants to have a relationship with you.", "NTA - make the family you always wanted girl.

Just that this particular instance alone wouldn't warrant it.", "INFO - Had you previously contacted your mother to let her know you would be in town this weekend or did she only find out when you called her on Saturday about coming over on Sunday?", "NTA. You might have been harsh on your mom, but perhaps its what is needed to realize that she can't take you for granted. I know many people who have children later in life and they over-prioritize them, trying to \"make up\" for being perhaps not the best parent they were in the past to their older children. \n\nGive yourselves both some time, and then sit down and be honest with her about how you feel. Your mom will be your mom for the rest of your/her life, and figuring out having an adult relationship with your parents is often a hard transition for many people. Good luck.", "NTA.

It's not CRAZY to hope that your mom will want to see you and spend time with you. Of course you're upset and hurt. It's not your responsibility to remind your mom that she should make an effort to have a relationship with you. Maintain and put effort into the relationships where you get back as much love as you give.", "NTA: she doesn\u2019t deserve your time or effort. The relationship is completely one sided, you putting in all the effort. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should have your back no matter what.", "NTA. Your mother couldn't be bothered to communicate with you, and found it more important to have your brother's ex and a child she isn't related to over to her house than her own child.\n\nYour fiance likely can't see anything outwith the realms of his own experiences so views your reaction as harsh. With that in mind to put it bluntly his view on the matter is irrelevant and bears no weight.", "NTA. Don't visit. You are wasting money and time. She chose someone else, so choose yourself and keep your distance. And if your fianc\u00e9 keeps telling you are wrong, reconsider this relationship. He should put you first, especially if you have talked about this pattern.", "I'm sorry. Really very sorry your mom treats you like this. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your mum has made her choice. You have done the right thing to walk away. It's up to her to prove herself, not for you to beg/chase her affection and time. And your fiance is also a big unsupportive AH. I hope you have friends who you can turn to as you obviously can't rely on your fiance for emotional support.", "NTA. Cut your losses and go live your best life. \nSurround yourself with kind,loving people .\nMake them your family.", "NTA, Your mother does not prioritize you, why should you prioritize her?", "NTA. Just because someone is clean and sober, does not mean they aren't still an arsehole. \n\nProof? I'm 17 years sober and still an arsehole.", "NTA. No contact with your mom to avoid that pain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother doesn\u2019t love you, honey. Go NC and live a great life. Tell your fianc\u00e9 if he sides with her again you will not marry him. I bet you he will try to invite her to your wedding and ruin your special day . You may want to dump the fianc\u00e9 too. He sucks.", "NTA. I don't expect my children to call just show up and let themselves in. They may want to call just to be sure I'm going to be home at some point. They never need permission to just come over.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t gone Nc with her. She doesn\u2019t seem to ever put you first. I can\u2019t imagine telling my kid not to visit me. That\u2019s so cold and heartless.", "NTA. You're not holding the past against your mother, because she hasn't changed her behavior. And I'm going to guess your fiance does not have any of the kind of history with his family that you do with yours. He needs to understand that things are different for you very quickly, or things are not going to work out long-term.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve to be treated better. Your fianc\u00e9 clearly doesn't understand so you might want to take the time to give them an in-depth heart to heart no holds barred talk. \n\nAs for your mother she unfortunately has chosen a different path. As have you.", "NTA. Your mom doesn\u2019t give 2 shits about you. Quit making an effort with her, you deserve better.", "NTA at all! If she can't be bothered then seriously stop worrying about her. I know its hard but you're definitely doing the right thing. I'm guessing your fiance has at least an OK relationship with his parent(s)? Because he clearly doesn't understand your situation. Unfortunately that will happen. I have people in my life who think I'm unfair to my mother and should \"try harder\".", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like an A and so does your mom. I get that she\u2019s your mom but sometimes it\u2019s better to find your own family instead of chasing one that is not that interested in you. Sounds like it just continues the hurt.", "NTA. Sounds like fiance is working from a background where mom doing this would be a genuinely abnormal circumstance, indicating either REALLY extreme stress or some kind of mental break or something. With the background of addiction and putting you second and her clearly either lying or trying to make it clear she was excluding you (because if it was such a bad time why is it ok for the others to be there? You're 19, you aren't going to add significant chaos or stress to a house that's already got two tiny kids in it) it's obvious that this is a last straw, not a freak occurrence. Might be worth trying to explain to your fiance all the background re: holidays and not being the priority, but if he still doesn't get it... you deserve someone who can treat your past with respect and understand if it's nothing like their own.", "yeah my mom cried when my stepdad and i tricked her into thinking i was spending christmas traveling to Italy my second year away from home (Navy, spent 3+ yrs overseas). we actually planned to surprise her and my dad picked me up from the airport while claiming to have to be at a job site around the area. to shorten up a long story she cried when she found me in the front seat of his work truck and called the both of us assholes for making her cry \ud83d\ude05", "Seriously.

Sometimes you just gotta put yourself and your health (mental, emotional, etc) first", "Just because someone gets clean doesn't mean they automaticcaly become a good person. Most addicts spend years chasing after the thing they want in the moment w/o the least care about how that impacts anyone else. For some, that is 100% due to the addiction, for others, they were that way before the addiction and stayed that way after they got clean.", "Then NTA thought I\u2019m surprised plans hadn\u2019t already been discussed for Easter.  Some chance she thought you were going to spend Easter with your grandparents so made alternate plans.
