She\u2019s much more traditional and has always wanted a lot of kids.   \nshe found out her first pregnancy she was having a boy and sobbed uncontrollably in the appt. I don\u2019t get that reaction, like a preference sure, but she did this for weeks. I figured we\u2019re super different and it\u2019s important to her so ok.  I tried to call her and stopped by with some ice cream to check if she needed anything.  I figured if she wanted to be alone I could just leave.  She lost it. How dare I bring her ice cream and expect her to do anything but grieve for at least a week. she didn\u2019t want ice cream she wanted a daughter.  In my head, I was like are you kidding me, but out loud I was like ok my bad. I got it wrong, but she kept screaming that I don\u2019t understand. she\u2019s right, and I said so and tried to back away. All screams\n\nI adore my now preschool age nephew. He\u2019s the best.  But my sister is pregnant again. She\u2019s just found out that not only is she having a boy, but her friend is expecting a girl.  She\u2019s thrown another diva tantrum and refused to talk to anyone today. history on repeat and honestly, after her eldest was born she would lean over the crib and be like \u201cwell of course you\u2019re a pain You\u2019re a boy\u201d or \u201cI bet you wouldn\u2019t act out if you were a girl\u201d.  Not all the time. But under stress, that came out. I would reminder her that\u2019s not his fault and he\u2019s gonna be really hurt by that someday but she swore he\u2019d never know and wouldn\u2019t say it in front of him\n\nMy parents asked me to go check on her and help out, but I reminded them of how that went last time and said I think it\u2019s best to let her throw her fit in peace.  That was the wrong thing to say; even I know that. But come on.   parents are appalled and think she has a young kid and extra stress and needs our support.  And yeah, probably, but if she won\u2019t accept it or just uses us as a scapegoat, is it really helping?\n\nI\u2019m thinking I should maybe stop by to make sure my nephew is ok, since hes really excited to be a big brother, But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to go right away because if she\u2019s nasty like last time, I will say something crappy because I think it\u2019s outta line to do this in front of her kid.  He\u2019s old enough to see and hear her\n\nMy parents have declared me heartless. They want to tell all our family and friends not to bring it up and be kind while she\u2019s grieving, but her pregnancy is not terminated! It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed but I don\u2019t trust her not to take it out on these kids anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole because I don\u2019t want to go over there to comfort her in her \u201cgrief\u201d?

You know who is heartless though?  Your parents and your sister, they don't care about your nephew?  What kind of sexist BS is he being subjected to?", "NTA-Disappointment that your baby is not your desired sex is real but it doesn\u2019t give anyone license to be a toxic asshole.", "NTA- Your sister is not mature enough to have children if she has to grieve every time, she finds out she's not having a girl. I would be worried about those boys if she does eventually have a girl or not. It feels like those kids are going to deal with a lot of grief either way growing up.", "NTA. Your family defines \"grief\" differently than most.", "NTA. Like you, I find your sister's behaviour really bizarre. There's nothing you can do for someone who is acting out like this. Your parents shouldn't be getting at you in any way.\n\n>My parents have declared me heartless.\n\nYou aren't the problem. They're expecting you to do something that they can't or won't do themselves.", "NTA. But your parents are.

Two kids but no mention of the dad.", "NTA but FFS she's not someone I could stomach. Send her an Uber eats with ice cream, then see how she is after the kids are in college.", "NTA I am so sorry for her children. Besides her  binary brain (everything a girl could do a boy could too and vice versa), what would happen if the child is disabled?\n\nI think she is heartless in wanting her perfect girl (what happens if she would hate pink/dresses/dolls?) without thinking about that children are different individuals. Maybe she could live her dream with one of her boys but she didn't gave them a chance.

And your misandrist AH sister is *grieving* what, exactly?  A healthy pregnancy?  Shame on her. I hope your nephew(s) never have to know this. I also hope she never ends up having a daughter, only because there'd likely be blatant favoritism.", "NTA, not everyone likes the drama and whoever got her pregnant can very well deal with the grief she throwing. Its not yours to deal with. Also you can ask your parents to volunteer if they want to. Why are they keeping away?", "Where is the father?", "NTA, it sounds like she probably shouldn't have any more kids... It's bad enough these two are stuck with her. Disappointment is one thing, I experienced that, but she has straight up resentment from the sound of it. \n\nNo normal person has a breakdown because their fetus has a penis.", "NTA. The AH in this story is your sister. A preference? Sure. A little bit of brief disappointment when you find out you\u2019re not getting your preference? Understandable. But if you can\u2019t be genuinely happy about the child you\u2019re getting, if you feel a need to carry on for weeks about your grief if you\u2019re getting the \u201cwrong\u201d sex, you just shouldn\u2019t be having a child.", "My husband and I were sure our youngest was going to be a boy.

In fact your sister sounds wholly unhinged and very likely shouldn't be having any babies at all. She's so far out of line that you need to very closely monitor her behavior toward those innocent children she's bringing into the world that she's apparently so viscerally opposed to because they happen to be male!\n\nI fully get trying to stay out of the line of fire but I truly see this as being an issue you will likely need to report to CPS, especially if everyone else in your family and her life think her treatment of her first born and her clearly sociopathic way of dealing with a second boy is \"normal\". \n\nThese are the kids that no one realizes until they're 10 or 12 that their mother has been abusing them because everyone covers for her because it's *\"NORMAL\"* to want girls or boys or whatever!", "NTA. I think gender disappointment is normal and human when you\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s how you react to it that makes you a bad guy or not.", "Yikes. NTA. She should probably stop having kids though, she sounds a bit too unhinged to be a parent.", "Nta. Its not like the poor kid was a given a choice in this matter. I hope your sister is careful about not behaving like this in front of her son. That's a terrible knowledge to have to grow up with.", "NTA; gosh your poor nephews", "I had a daughter. I wanted a daughter. Great stuff. I then wanted a son. Boom perfect little family, and one of each. Second was also a girl and I cried. Took three hours and I was okay with that. Had two boys later. Kids are kids. Boys are an adventure, and so are girls, and shame on her for caring so much about having a girl. Gender isn't everything. Everything is watching a baby become a toddler, pass milestones and grow into an adult you raised well. You did nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA.  Your sister needs professional help.  If your parent think you\u2019re heartless, they can check on her themselves.  They raised the adult bratty diva that they\u2019re asking you to help out.  Have her throw a fit solo and unseen.", "NTA\n\nIt's ridiculous. I would suspect some serious mental issues. How's her partner reacting to this?", "NTA. pregnancy hormones can be awful so i get her crying because she wasn\u2019t having a girl, but by now she needs to move past it and stop that \u201c you wouldn\u2019t act out if you were a girl \u201c BS. now that she\u2019s having another boy it\u2019ll probably be worse. and if she does end up having a girl later, she\u2019ll be treated like a princess while her brothers are pushed aside. something similar happened in my family, couple relatives kept having girls until they finally got their boy, and guess who\u2019s spoiled and the favorite. nasty behavior that your sister will likely fall into. from what i see, she is not mature enough to have children.", "I had three boys and a girl, my daughter was born last. I came from a family of all girls and mostly babysat girls so I was super hopeful to have a daughter. When my three boys were born one after another I was a bit bummed that it wasn't the daughter I was hoping for but I got over it before I even left my ultrasound appointment. My daughter was a surprise pregnancy so I feel like had I been planning for another pregnancy I would have had another boy and I was fine with that idea. I was overjoyed to be having a daughter finally but also a teeny bit bummed I didn't have four of one gender like my parents. Your sister is overreacting big time and should not be making a huge deal of this. You are smart to just give her space and let her have her tantrum with out your involvement. NTA", "NTA. The second your sister gets a girl both of her male children will be thrown away or severely neglected. I agree she shouldn't get stressed more than she is already but you should check in for your nephews sake.", "NTA, I'll never understand these over exaggerated reactions to finding out you're having the opposite sex of what you wanted. I understand a slight disappointment, but to say those things to your infant son, even if he doesn't understand, is disgusting. \nI would also like to point out, as a mother of 3 wonderful daughters, that if she thinks a girl won't act out or be a pain she is sorely mistaken. My daughters are no different than my brothers at the same ages. My two youngest had fight club going on in their room. They were just punching each other for the fun of it and when my youngest came out with a bloody mouth they both claimed it was an accident to my husband, but they later admitted to their fight club (they didn't use that term, we did because it's what came to mind) to me. My husband did remind them what the first rule was...", "My husband and I were sure our youngest was going to be a boy.", "Yeah, gender disappointment is real, but I've never heard/read about someone acting like OP sister for this long and being such an AH to the baby after it's born. Most get over their gender disappointment pretty fast, and those that take a while to get over it still don't act like this. Not out loud at least.\n\nNTA OP", "Not to mention if sacred daughter isn't exactly how she imagined", "I had a boy first and would have liked a girl next, just to experience both. I ended up giving my oldest a baby brother. I was disappointed for literally three seconds when I found out, but I was also given the results of an important test at the same time, and the fact that the baby was healthy was what I took away from that conversation.\n\nAlso, my boys are better behaved than many little girls I've met, so OP's sister can eff off with her \"you wouldn't be like this if you weren't a boy\" attitude. Those poor kids.", "We have six, girl, then boy ,then girl, then boy ,then girl , girl. But the youngest I hardly had morning sickness,  which is why we thought she was a boy. It was weird not thinking of the kid as Amdrew, which was our top contender for a boys name. It took a while to come up with her name, but it fits her very well. \n\nI knew a couple of families that had a couple of one gender and wanted a kid of the other, but if they were disappointed about not getting the other gender they never let it show. It's so much more important that the kid is healthy.", "The couple I was sharing my hospital room with had a surprise girl. They were scrambling to think of a name for her. \n\nI understand having an initial preference, but parents eventually have to move on from that. OP's sister is taking it way too hard.", "I agree. She needs help. Putting up with this tantrum is insane. I'm really disappointed in OPS parents for excusing this. When our first was born, guys would tell my husband that maybe the next kid would be a boy, and he always looked at them like they had multiple heads, because why would the sex of the baby be more important than the babies health. It's 2023, not 1540. Shouldn't we be beyond this by now."]}
