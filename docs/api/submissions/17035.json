I don\u2019t get that reaction, like a preference sure, but she did this for weeks. I figured we\u2019re super different and it\u2019s important to her so ok.  I tried to call her and stopped by with some ice cream to check if she needed anything.  I figured if she wanted to be alone I could just leave.  She lost it. How dare I bring her ice cream and expect her to do anything but grieve for at least a week. she didn\u2019t want ice cream she wanted a daughter.  In my head, I was like are you kidding me, but out loud I was like ok my bad. I got it wrong, but she kept screaming that I don\u2019t understand. she\u2019s right, and I said so and tried to back away. All screams\n\nI adore my now preschool age nephew. He\u2019s the best.  But my sister is pregnant again. She\u2019s just found out that not only is she having a boy, but her friend is expecting a girl.  She\u2019s thrown another diva tantrum and refused to talk to anyone today. history on repeat and honestly, after her eldest was born she would lean over the crib and be like \u201cwell of course you\u2019re a pain You\u2019re a boy\u201d or \u201cI bet you wouldn\u2019t act out if you were a girl\u201d.

That was the wrong thing to say; even I know that. But come on.   parents are appalled and think she has a young kid and extra stress and needs our support.  And yeah, probably, but if she won\u2019t accept it or just uses us as a scapegoat, is it really helping?\n\nI\u2019m thinking I should maybe stop by to make sure my nephew is ok, since hes really excited to be a big brother, But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to go right away because if she\u2019s nasty like last time, I will say something crappy because I think it\u2019s outta line to do this in front of her kid.  He\u2019s old enough to see and hear her\n\nMy parents have declared me heartless. They want to tell all our family and friends not to bring it up and be kind while she\u2019s grieving, but her pregnancy is not terminated! It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed but I don\u2019t trust her not to take it out on these kids anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole because I don\u2019t want to go over there to comfort her in her \u201cgrief\u201d?

In fact your sister sounds wholly unhinged and very likely shouldn't be having any babies at all. She's so far out of line that you need to very closely monitor her behavior toward those innocent children she's bringing into the world that she's apparently so viscerally opposed to because they happen to be male!\n\nI fully get trying to stay out of the line of fire but I truly see this as being an issue you will likely need to report to CPS, especially if everyone else in your family and her life think her treatment of her first born and her clearly sociopathic way of dealing with a second boy is \"normal\". \n\nThese are the kids that no one realizes until they're 10 or 12 that their mother has been abusing them because everyone covers for her because it's *\"NORMAL\"* to want girls or boys or whatever!", "NTA. I think gender disappointment is normal and human when you\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s how you react to it that makes you a bad guy or not.", "Yikes. NTA. She should probably stop having kids though, she sounds a bit too unhinged to be a parent.", "Nta. Its not like the poor kid was a given a choice in this matter. I hope your sister is careful about not behaving like this in front of her son. That's a terrible knowledge to have to grow up with.", "NTA; gosh your poor nephews", "I had a daughter. I wanted a daughter. Great stuff. I then wanted a son. Boom perfect little family, and one of each. Second was also a girl and I cried. Took three hours and I was okay with that. Had two boys later. Kids are kids. Boys are an adventure, and so are girls, and shame on her for caring so much about having a girl. Gender isn't everything. Everything is watching a baby become a toddler, pass milestones and grow into an adult you raised well. You did nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA.  Your sister needs professional help.  If your parent think you\u2019re heartless, they can check on her themselves.  They raised the adult bratty diva that they\u2019re asking you to help out.  Have her throw a fit solo and unseen.", "NTA\n\nIt's ridiculous. I would suspect some serious mental issues. How's her partner reacting to this?", "NTA. pregnancy hormones can be awful so i get her crying because she wasn\u2019t having a girl, but by now she needs to move past it and stop that \u201c you wouldn\u2019t act out if you were a girl \u201c BS. now that she\u2019s having another boy it\u2019ll probably be worse. and if she does end up having a girl later, she\u2019ll be treated like a princess while her brothers are pushed aside. something similar happened in my family, couple relatives kept having girls until they finally got their boy, and guess who\u2019s spoiled and the favorite. nasty behavior that your sister will likely fall into. from what i see, she is not mature enough to have children.", "I had three boys and a girl, my daughter was born last. I came from a family of all girls and mostly babysat girls so I was super hopeful to have a daughter. When my three boys were born one after another I was a bit bummed that it wasn't the daughter I was hoping for but I got over it before I even left my ultrasound appointment. My daughter was a surprise pregnancy so I feel like had I been planning for another pregnancy I would have had another boy and I was fine with that idea. I was overjoyed to be having a daughter finally but also a teeny bit bummed I didn't have four of one gender like my parents. Your sister is overreacting big time and should not be making a huge deal of this. You are smart to just give her space and let her have her tantrum with out your involvement. NTA", "NTA. The second your sister gets a girl both of her male children will be thrown away or severely neglected. I agree she shouldn't get stressed more than she is already but you should check in for your nephews sake.", "NTA, I'll never understand these over exaggerated reactions to finding out you're having the opposite sex of what you wanted. I understand a slight disappointment, but to say those things to your infant son, even if he doesn't understand, is disgusting. \nI would also like to point out, as a mother of 3 wonderful daughters, that if she thinks a girl won't act out or be a pain she is sorely mistaken. My daughters are no different than my brothers at the same ages. My two youngest had fight club going on in their room. They were just punching each other for the fun of it and when my youngest came out with a bloody mouth they both claimed it was an accident to my husband, but they later admitted to their fight club (they didn't use that term, we did because it's what came to mind) to me. My husband did remind them what the first rule was...", "My husband and I were sure our youngest was going to be a boy.", "Yeah, gender disappointment is real, but I've never heard/read about someone acting like OP sister for this long and being such an AH to the baby after it's born.

I ended up giving my oldest a baby brother. I was disappointed for literally three seconds when I found out, but I was also given the results of an important test at the same time, and the fact that the baby was healthy was what I took away from that conversation.\n\nAlso, my boys are better behaved than many little girls I've met, so OP's sister can eff off with her \"you wouldn't be like this if you weren't a boy\" attitude. Those poor kids.", "We have six, girl, then boy ,then girl, then boy ,then girl , girl. But the youngest I hardly had morning sickness,  which is why we thought she was a boy. It was weird not thinking of the kid as Amdrew, which was our top contender for a boys name. It took a while to come up with her name, but it fits her very well. \n\nI knew a couple of families that had a couple of one gender and wanted a kid of the other, but if they were disappointed about not getting the other gender they never let it show. It's so much more important that the kid is healthy.", "The couple I was sharing my hospital room with had a surprise girl. They were scrambling to think of a name for her. \n\nI understand having an initial preference, but parents eventually have to move on from that. OP's sister is taking it way too hard.", "I agree. She needs help. Putting up with this tantrum is insane. I'm really disappointed in OPS parents for excusing this. When our first was born, guys would tell my husband that maybe the next kid would be a boy, and he always looked at them like they had multiple heads, because why would the sex of the baby be more important than the babies health. It's 2023, not 1540. Shouldn't we be beyond this by now.", "NTA. Gender disappointment is not uncommon. I saw so much of it when I was pregnant and posting on pregnancy message boards. But her reaction is not within the realm of reasonable or acceptable. She needs to get therapy and figure her shit out for the sake of her children. And she definitely shouldn't have any more until she can accept that the next one could very well be a boy as well.\n\nAnd she treated you terribly the last time you went to comfort her. After that display I'd never go over to offer comfort again.\n\nThe only thing I would do is offer to take your nephew out for a fun day. You can say it's to take him off her hands for a bit but I'd be doing it for him, not for her. He's just an innocent victim in all this.

Your sister sounds like a piece of work, your poor nephew.", "NTA, what the heck?! We have 4 boys (3 me 1 him) and together we have a baby girl, although I was so excited to have a girl, even if she had been a he no way would I have a tantrum over it! That\u2019s just bonkers.

She sounds awful", "NTA. If you get pregnant you need to accept that it\u2019s 50/50 whether you get a girl or a boy. And honestly it doesn\u2019t matter because you need to love that child unconditionally regardless. I have four boys and it\u2019s never bothered me that I don\u2019t have a girl. At the end of the day, I have four awesome humans who bring me so much joy.", "How in the world can your parents call you heartless when your sister is the one who's a psychotic monster of a mother? Are they aware of how she treats their grandson? And trust me, if she's comfortable voicing her feelings out loud, your nephew is aware. NTA", "Your not but your family are.\n\nWhy are people so obsessed over having a certain sex? \n\nWe had a Girl and I felt so much pressure from relatives and friends because they all had boys and wanted a girl. I wasn't bothered I just wanted a Healthy baby. What worrys me is your sisters resentment it's vile. Those boys are going to grow up knowing she wanted a girl and feel bad. \n\nWhen you have sex and get pregnant you get either a boy or a girl it's just what happens. \nMaybe I see it differently as I grew up watching my aunt trying to have a baby and the pain and heartbreak she went through just to have one healthy child. In the end she did.", ">My parents asked me to go check on her and help out...\n\nThey can go do that. NTA. I'm not showing up for people's temper tantrums and sexism.", "NTA, your sister needs some serious therapy if she handles having a boy like this. Those poor kids, they will know their mom wanted a girl, they will suffer for it.", "NTA and no your not heartless, but your sister is inmature. I feel sorry for your nephew (and so to be born nephew). She says that they will never know but I think there will be behaviours and comments from your sister when they grow up that they will pick up on. What if she has a third pregnancy and it's another boy? If she decides to have a third child I think she should seek help at an IVF clinic for choosing gender. I think it's silly but your sister seems to be obsessed and bitter over the fact that she does not have a girl. \n\nBut then the problem will probably be favouritsm, based on her wish for a daughter and her comments about her son being a pain because of his gender. \n\nYou're the sane one, and your parents are just enabling her by thinking it's resonable for her to grieve and everyone around her should support that.", "NTA and tbh, if she ever does have a daughter I don't know who to pity more - her or her older brothers. This is not healthy for anyone. Have you ever discussed this with her partner?", "NTA. One of my classmates' mom wanted a girl and got a boy. She'd pretend the boy was a girl and dress him up in \"feminine\" clothing. This went on until the chip started asking for more \"masculine\" clothing and toys. She lost it. Started ignoring the boy and shaming him. To this day he goes to therapy due to the rejection he felt from his mum.\n\nPlease don't let this happen to your nephews.", "Your sister shouldn't have kids anymore. Her mentality is completely asshole-ish. You can't be like I only want either boys or no kids. I don't think she's fit to raise them.", "NTA. She\u2019s not grieving. And she can\u2019t go around saying that because she\u2019s going to end up telling the wrong person. I can\u2019t imagine your poor nephew, how does she treat him? Maybe just offer to take him out for fun stuff that way she\u2019s left on her own and the kid is happy and you don\u2019t have to listen to her.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister needs some serious therapy. It's normal to have a preference, and to grieve somewhat when you don't get your preference. She is literally blaming her son for being born a boy. He has zero control over that. It is poisoning every interaction they have, and he is going to need serious therapy himself if someone doesn't put a stop to this.\n\nQuestion: where is her husband in all of this? Is he trying to talk her off the ledge? Or is he part of the problem?", "NTA but I think if you have means to be , be prepared to be the sane person in these kids lives cause your family enabling her lunacy is pretty scary", "NTA at least your nephew won't be a mama's boy. Usually women prefer sons over daughters.", "When I had my daughter there was a mother in the hospital who was in tears because she had a healthy daughter, but wanted a son. One of the nurses found her crying and asked what was the problem. The woman explained. The nurse went to town on her saying that here is a woman with a healthy baby, while a few doors down is a dead mother and baby. That puts people who complain about the sex of the baby's moans into perspective.
