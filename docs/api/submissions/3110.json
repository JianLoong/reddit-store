The youngest is 19 and here is the issue. The youngest wants to attend an out of state college. He currently attends an in-state college, where he receives a 50% discount on tuition because of my husband's employment. He also receives a state scholarship, based on his high school academics, but he did not receive an academic scholarship from the school he is attending. All in all with tuition and the discounts, he has to take out about 3k a semester in loans and my husband and I make up the shortfall, which is around $3,300 and any additional expenses.\n\n When our son started high school, he insisted that he needed to attend a private high school, and we were reluctant and explained to him that if he attended a private high school, he would need to make the best of it, as we would not be able to assist him with college.  \n\nOne older sibling attended public high school and the other older sibling attended a private school as well, but the tuition was quite low because that sibling received a scholarship. Each year cost about $3k (maybe), and that sibling will graduate from college next month, with very little assistance from us. \n\nFor our son, the first year of high school, we received financial aid, and spent about $6-7k that year, but the remaining three years, we did not receive as much aid, and ended up paying about $12-$14k. Our son also wanted to go on a trip abroad with his school's sports' team, which cost us another $4k. We also bought him a used car (as we did for his siblings, and that was another $12k. So we spent any where from $58k to $60k for high school. \n\nNow, the issue is our son wants to transfer to an out of state college, and we have said he can do whatever he wishes, but we are not spending more than what we spend now.\n\nMy husband and I do not have large cash reserves or a huge retirement account. We have debt, and our house is not paid off yet either.  We do not wish to do any parent loans, etc. I'm still paying off my student loans. In addition, my husband has been under a contract, which has paid well, but ends in seven months, and we do not know if it will be renewed.\n\nLong story, but we've had extensive medical bills and though I have an advanced degree, I never made a \"career\" for myself. As a matter of fact, I work part-time. My son called me a fucking lazy bitch tonight. \n\nAm I the asshole for not signing parent loans, liquidating whatever equity we have in the house and our retirement accounts, so that he can transfer to an out of state college for an undergrad degree. For the record, he did make straight A's his first semester of college and is on track to make straight A's for his second semester.", "created_utc": 1669259333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z38p8i/aita_for_not_paying_more_for_sons_college_tuition/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son is ungrateful to say the least.

What I can do is take out student loans, etc. My education is something I won\u2019t blame my parents for not being able to afford.\n\nYour son needs to be reminded that not every child has had resources given to them by their parents. Some people have to figure it out on their own. Not only have you been extremely generous with your children\u2019s education, you\u2019re in debt.

You might have to sell it for yourself later.\n\nBut he called you a fucking lazy bitch? I'm sorry, WHAT? WHAT? No. Those words are next to a slap in the face.

That he is choosing a different, more expensive path is not your problem to solve.", "NTA! If he insists on going to out state school then he can figure it out and either try to get scholarships or take out loans.", "NTA but sounds like this child is a spoiled brat. Cut him off. If you're so lazy, he obviously should pay his own way. He also wouldn't be welcome in my house.", "NTA - max entitlement on your son there. He needs a harsh reality check.

Do NOT, under any circumstances, give in to this entitled little prick you have raised!  \n\nYou were very clear with him what the consequences of his educational decisions would be.  And for him to call you lazy?  That's pretty damned rich coming from someone who wants to milk mommy and daddy dry from all their assets just a few years from retirement!  That comment alone would have resulted in my planting my foot firmly into his behind as I informed him there would be no further financial contributions forthcoming, if that were my kid.  You do NOT owe him the secondary education of his choosing.  Especially if you have health issues, are approaching retirement, and have over-extended yourselves to pay for secondary education expenses for each of your kids.\n\nTell that little cretin that it's high time he learns how things work in the real world.  He can figure it all out on his own - whether he gets a job, takes out loans himself, stays where he is at or goes where he wants.  He can just figure out the finances since he is so damned smart that he feels it is ok to bite the hand supporting him.  \n\nSo sorry you raised this person to be as entitled as he is.  You are NTA for saying no.", "NTA.  Your son however sounds like an entitled AH, an ungrateful one at that.  If he doesn't already have one it's time for him to get a part time job to help pay for himself.", "NTA. You told him if he went to private school you wouldn't be able to help much with university. He's the one that's chosen the more expensive routes for high school and now university. And he calls you a lazy b?! Heck no!!! He wasn't entitled to what you've already paid.

You need to look out for your future. You do not owe anyone a free college education, and your son is choosing to go to a college that is totally out of your budget. If he is going to do this he needs to get student loans. You have done more than enough already. Your own future is in jeopardy. He needs to be financially accountable for his college choices.\n\nAs for being a lazy bitch, there are college students who work full time and go to school. Some do more than that. Don't leave yourself in financial distress when he can take steps to help himself.", "NTA.  You can only afford what you can afford.  And, to be clear, that means afford without placing your own financial well being (and retirement) at risk.  Letting him go wherever but keeping your financial commitment the same as it is now is very reasonable.\n\nThe name calling on his part, while cruel and uncalled for, isn\u2019t the issue.  You had an education budget and you spent much of it in high school.  At his request.", "NTA, I have a feeling he might be comparing himself with his more 'privileged' friends from school. This was one reason why my husband didn't want to send my kids to private school but I did because if better facilities for my daughter that has a learning disability. My kids know how much money my husband and I make and the reason we drive 'ok' cars instead of BMW's, Mercedes etc. If one of them ever called us lazy, they'd regret it so fast because they know that they will be reminded by each and every one of their relatives to respect the sacrifices my husband and I made for the kids (we're of Asian descent so respecting your elders is taken seriously by the older generation).", "NTA. If you give in to your child after being clear about his educational choices \u2014 and after he had a temper tantrum and majorly disrespected you \u2014 you\u2019d frankly be enabling bad, entitled behavior that would set him up poorly for the real world. A state education with only $24k total debt across 4 years is still pretty darn good by comparison to how many kids fare.

And it may create resentment issues with your other kids.", "NTA", "NTA - for what your son called you a lazy fing B word alone you should do nothing more to help himn.  he is ungrateful and to be honest sounds lazy himself.  he can go get himself a part time job to offset to the bill.", "NTA.

He isn't entitled to your money.\n\nYou have your own burdens to deal with and that should be your main focus.", "100% this. He has quite the sense of entitlement, doesn't he?\n\nNTA\n\nDo not liquidate assets. Regardless of how he treated you, you know retirement is approaching. You have your own financial issues to think about now. He is an adult and he is an adult who can figure this out. It sounds like he'd be just fine at the local university - the out of state one is a want. Not a need. He is being incredibly selfish and disrespectful", "Agree NTA. His disrespectful attitude and rudeness to you would also mean I\u2019d start reducing what I\u2019m contributing currently. It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed in not getting what you want, it\u2019s another to lash out and be incredibly rude and insulting. If he wants to mouth off and be nasty like that, he can figure out how to come up with all the money. As others have noted, he can continue where he is and get a good education. It\u2019s his choice to go somewhere else and spend a ton more money\u2026and it can come out of his pocket.", "Ooh, just saw the comment about being a lazy bitch.
