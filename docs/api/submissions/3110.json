The youngest is 19 and here is the issue. The youngest wants to attend an out of state college. He currently attends an in-state college, where he receives a 50% discount on tuition because of my husband's employment. He also receives a state scholarship, based on his high school academics, but he did not receive an academic scholarship from the school he is attending. All in all with tuition and the discounts, he has to take out about 3k a semester in loans and my husband and I make up the shortfall, which is around $3,300 and any additional expenses.\n\n When our son started high school, he insisted that he needed to attend a private high school, and we were reluctant and explained to him that if he attended a private high school, he would need to make the best of it, as we would not be able to assist him with college.  \n\nOne older sibling attended public high school and the other older sibling attended a private school as well, but the tuition was quite low because that sibling received a scholarship. Each year cost about $3k (maybe), and that sibling will graduate from college next month, with very little assistance from us. \n\nFor our son, the first year of high school, we received financial aid, and spent about $6-7k that year, but the remaining three years, we did not receive as much aid, and ended up paying about $12-$14k. Our son also wanted to go on a trip abroad with his school's sports' team, which cost us another $4k. We also bought him a used car (as we did for his siblings, and that was another $12k. So we spent any where from $58k to $60k for high school. \n\nNow, the issue is our son wants to transfer to an out of state college, and we have said he can do whatever he wishes, but we are not spending more than what we spend now.\n\nMy husband and I do not have large cash reserves or a huge retirement account. We have debt, and our house is not paid off yet either.  We do not wish to do any parent loans, etc. I'm still paying off my student loans. In addition, my husband has been under a contract, which has paid well, but ends in seven months, and we do not know if it will be renewed.\n\nLong story, but we've had extensive medical bills and though I have an advanced degree, I never made a \"career\" for myself. As a matter of fact, I work part-time. My son called me a fucking lazy bitch tonight. \n\nAm I the asshole for not signing parent loans, liquidating whatever equity we have in the house and our retirement accounts, so that he can transfer to an out of state college for an undergrad degree. For the record, he did make straight A's his first semester of college and is on track to make straight A's for his second semester.", "created_utc": 1669259333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z38p8i/aita_for_not_paying_more_for_sons_college_tuition/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That comment alone would have resulted in my planting my foot firmly into his behind as I informed him there would be no further financial contributions forthcoming, if that were my kid.  You do NOT owe him the secondary education of his choosing.

Also, it will not stop here - wedding ( one Redditer had their daughter asking to fund third wedding in ten years ), house and so on. \nPlease stick to your grounds . I think he felt entitled as his brother went there - though he didn\u2019t receive the scholarship . And now that his friends from high school might be going to out of state schools, he must be feeling entitled. And his comment was rude. Isn\u2019t he the same as he didn\u2019t work hard to get the scholarship in high school nor a scholarship at any out of state school? Point that out", "Cut the kid off NTA", "NTA \n\nAfter the name calling I would cut him off totally, he does not respect your hard earned money and you already told him when he decided private school you would not be able to help him much with college \n\nTime for him to get a part time work and pay his own way", "NTA. And I\u2019d toss him out on his entitled little ass.", "NTA. After his rude comment his college money should be cut off. He sounds like an entitled AH.", "Your son called you what?! My parents would have been done with me financially at least at that age if I ever talked to my mom in such a disrespectful manner. Definitely NTA and Mr. Foul Mouth can get those loans all on his own. He's 19 and actions have consequences.", "YTA not for not paying for out of state school, but for creating a situation where you used so much money on HS that you created these expectations. For example, our kids had to contribute to school trips or they didn't go. You never said no and created these expectations. He can finish at state u", "Right? That comment alone reduced his aide to 0", "Won\u2019t really matter. Without his parents co-signing he won\u2019t be able to take out enough anyways to cover an OOS school. Most he can take by himself is $5500/yr.", "NTA. Basically it's not an issue that you don't want to, but that you simply are not able to. \n\nBut him cussing you is not okay. Either he is totally in the dark about your financial situation and thinks you simply don't want to support him, or he is an entitled A H. In both cases he should get a reality check.", ",", "The golden child is finally showing his true colors.", "NTA\n\n\u201c My son called me a fucking lazy bitch tonight.\u201d\n\nCut him off. \n\nHe can get loans for college. You can\u2019t borrow for retirement.", "NTA.  You son sounds like he's super entitled.  You response regarding him going to the out of state school is exactly what I would have said.  Do what you want, but we aren't paying any more than what we are paying now.\n\nAfter what he said to you, he's lucky you are still willing to pay anything.  \n\nDon't back down - you are actually helping him to be self-sufficient if he has to figure this out himself.", "NTA, your son is entitled and needs a reality check. He's more than old enough to fend for himself if he wants to start calling you names and treating you guys like an ATM. I have a teen in high school and we were very upfront that there's no way we can cover him going to a big expensive school. So he's working his butt off for scholarships and looking for work study opportunities and doing dual credit classes while in high school. \n\nThere are tons of scholarships and grants and work-study opportunities out there and several colleges and universities offering tuition assistance for those under a certain income. Like UT in Austin offers tuition assistance for people with $125k and under for household incomes. \n\nDrop him like a stone and let him figure out how to stand on his own two feet instead of leeching off of you.", "NTA\n\nEducation costs in teh States are insane, but you shouldn't liquidate your assets to pay for his college, not if you already dumped 30k or so into high school.", "NTA tell him to go find a job", "NTA \n\nIf he can swear and be nasty then he can receive 0 financial help from you and your husband.", "NTA\n\nIn fact, after what the entitled little A H called you. You should be done financially helping him wherever he goes.", "ESH Your son for his attitude & entitlement. You & your husband for clearly giving in to his every demand his whole life. He INSISTED on private high school and you just went along? That\u2019s a parent\u2019s decision, not a kids. You shouldn\u2019t pay any more than you are right now (and you\u2019re NTA for that) but chickens are coming home to roost after other bad decisions.", "N T A at all but because he called you that, I would revoke all help.  He can get loans and since he is anti lazy, he can work to pay off the loans later.", "ESH. Your son is super disrespectful and entitled. But why did you and your husband shell out $60k+ for private school and associated luxuries if there was a decent public school in your area? Your husband is 64, you have not a huge retirement account plus debt on top of the mortgage, and you're still only working part time (! You're 53 and still paying off student loans!)? A $4k trip, $36k in cars for teenagers, totally unnecessary $42k-$49k in high school tuition?! Imagine if you'd put that into the stock market years ago, or how much interest you could've saved if you'd taken a big chunk out of your medical debt or student loans. Bleh.\n\nYour son \"insisted\" that he go to a private high school?! Lol! My parents were very lenient with me growing up but I never demanded anything like that from them\u2014especially with such a massive pricetag attached. My parents were great at educating me about when something was an unnecessary or out-of-reach/unwise purchase. When I was 16 they strongly advised that I get my first part-time job. They lent me their old car until I saved up enough from my cashier job to buy my own used car in cash. I got to go to the senior trip to an amusement park three hours away, but my parents weren't buying teenage me European getaways hahaha. We were not rich and so did not spend money like rich people. \n\nThe number one lesson they always conveyed was to live within your means. Of course they helped me out within their own means, which was life changing and I'm super grateful, but the most important thing they taught me was the difference between good debt and bad debt, as well as how to do a cost-benefit analysis when I was thinking about making a major expenditure (like choosing in-state vs. out-of-state college, or paying for an expensive opportunity).\n\nSo while I think your son is being a little ungrateful asshole and of course you should not liquidate your home equity/retirement accounts, I think overall Y T A in the long run for not having taught and modeled better financial responsibility to your son. I wonder how your older kids are doing financially\u2014if well, maybe they can have a talk with him about personal responsibility and why he might rethink wanting to transfer out of state.\n\nETA - My parents did some parent loans and I took out loans (which my parents co-signed) and did work study throughout college for the rest, then paid it all off within about five years. I sold that car I bought in high school to cover my tuition gap one year. I got a full ride for grad school. My sister went to out-of-state expensive schools for undergrad and grad, and she's still paying off debt but is a high earner. I hope your son's at least had to work at some point by this age to understand the value of a dollar.", "NTA.  I had saved enough money for my son to attend an in-state college without debt.  His girlfriend convinced him to apply for a junior year transfer to the Ivy League school she attended.  He was accepted and wanted to attend.  He knew exactly what my financial status was - middle income, mortgage, etc.  I told him I could continue to pay what I would have paid for in-state tuition, but he would have to get loans for the rest.  So he ended up taking out $40,000 in loans for 2 years, then more loans for an out of state graduate school.  He is now close to 40 years old and tells me often that he regrets going to such expensive schools because he has a lot of student loan debt.  OP's son sounds very entitled.  The \"b\\*\\*\\*h comment would be enough for me to withdraw all support unless there was an abject apology.", "I\u2019m betting that OP has never told her son no till now.", "My late husband always said, \"There are no loans for retirement, but there are student loans.\"", "Why does Reddit do this? We\u2019re talking about a problem Op has now, and not speculating about scenarios in which her son *might* stick his hand in his parent\u2019s pockets XX years in the future.\n\nNTA Op.", "NTA. Your son called you WHAT? Frankly, I would inform him that not only will you not pay any more for his college, you aren't giving him any more money at all. From now on, he's on his own.\n\nHe thinks you are a lazy B? BE ONE! You need to look after your own future. He has decades to earn money to pay off his loans; you are about to lose your revenue streams. If he's living at home \u2014\u00a0start charging rent or give him notice to move out. You aren't an ATM machine, nor are you deserving of being called names.  He can fund his college, as you told him he'd have to if he went to private high school, but he isn't entitled to impoverish you for his own selfish wants.", "Why you would consider giving a cent to a child that called you a lazy bitch is beyond me. He can take out loans, get a job or settle for less but after that insult my purse would be closed. NTA", "Absurd how some counties people need to pay for their kids education", "NTA. You wouldn\u2019t even be T A if he hadn\u2019t called you names, but now that he has? He should get nothing.", "NTA. I specifically didn\u2019t want my parents taking these loans out - they did for my sibling, and I think they regret it.", "NTA. But\u2026 you\u2019ve somewhat had things go wrong somewhere to have your son be so entitled and rude enough to call you what he did. Talk about projection! That would be enough for me to withdraw all aid, immediately. He plainly needs to be told no more than he has been to date.", "NTA- If you want your son to become a balanced functioning member of society kindly let him know that he is now on his own financially. Let him see what the price of a dollar is because right now he has no idea. Seriously, cut him off. Words have consequences.", "NTA. Your son is very entitled.", "NTA. Your generosity has created a monster. Now it is time for tough love. Let him be a man and be responsible for himself and all of his expenses.", "Nta", "This. It's time for OP to cut son off 100% financially. I'd even summarise the amount that's been spent on his schooling already and show him so he can't complain.", "I think they are looking at the ongoing trend. Had to have expensive private school. Had to go on expensive school trip. Now wants to go to expensive out of state college. So what would be the obvious next step? So far there is no evidence of him working hard to pay for the things he wants. I can see where the logic led them."]}
