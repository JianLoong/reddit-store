And at some point, you probably are going to have to lay out for her that you don\u2019t intend to remain in mourning forever and you\u2019re not going to apologize for that, so you don\u2019t *have* to live in fear of her causing a scene over you, an unattached woman, doing what you want in your own home.

You had your own reasons for not making yourself available at that particular moment.

She arrived from **another continent** with no warning and tried to drop in on you, in person, without calling / texting / emailing first?  \n\nShe probably wasn't acting in good faith - she may even have been trying to \"check up\" on you, to see if you had a guy over.  It sounds like she has some real issues there, especially if it's been 3 years - it's very reasonable for a widow/er to start dating much sooner **if** they feel like it.\n\nBest case, she was just really thoughtless and inconsiderate to show up without warning.

It's the 21st century, there is literally no reason for anyone to just pop up on your doorstep unless it's an actual emergency. To me, a trip halfway across the world for visiting purposes doesn't qualify as an emergency circumstance where no prior notice on her part would be acceptable.", "Wait what? If the dude was just an Airbnb guest why would you not just be like \"that's Dave he's here for a few days airbnb-ing the spare room, don't mind him\"\n\nNAH as it's clear your MIL thought it would be a surprise visit you would enjoy - although if, as you say, you actually do like her, I do think you could have been a little bit nicer like \"oh I'm out today, can we meet for lunch tomorrow' rather than \"I'm out of town\"", "NTA\n\nShe dropped in\u2026 all the way from the UK to Australia?  I don\u2019t think so.  She sounds like she is stalking you.", "Ooof.  Even if your guest were a date, it should not have been a problem.  You decide **if or when** you are ready.   It sounds like MIL wants you permanently living in her bubble of grief, without moving on at all.  I feel for her, but this problem is totally on her.  The fact you were worried she would cause a scene is all the information we need to say NTA.", "NTA. People showing up without warning has been largely socially unacceptable for a while now.

It honestly would\u2019ve been fine it\u2019s just the fact I had the guy staying at mine really :/", "Thank you and yes I understand that she just gets very defensive over it which I do also understand as she lost her son too", "Thank you!

It's just a bit disappointing that you would be judged harshly for having an Airbnb guest that you are making revenue from in your home simply because of their gender. I imagine that she knows you very well by now and SHOULD know you better than that. \n\nMore importantly you are allowed to have male guests in your home and even if it had been an intimate partner you should not be made to feel guilty for that. I am so sorry for your loss op. I just hope and pray that you are gentle and kind with yourself and allow yourself to move forward without any guilt for doing so. Stay strong hun and good luck.", "Also, does she know that you host a room on Airbnb? So you can let her know if she'd like to visit in the future, it would be best to arrange it ahead of time as you may have guests.", "people who flip out over reasonable things (and a widow spending time with male human beings for any reason is totally fine) don't get invited in to cause chaos.   im sorry for your loss, and i hope you are able to find happiness.", "international plane tickets don't happen magically or instantly.   if she let you know in advance, it sounds like there would be no issue.", "Who cares?  She's not the arbiter of your decisions.", "Since you have the internet, how is that possible?

Honest question.\n\nShe decided to make some major travel plans on the baseless and frankly insulting assumption that you'd have literally nothing better to do than to host her.  Turns out she was wrong.\n\nSo why do you feel bad that she made a bad assumption?", "I guess maybe it would be so expensive for me to visit other countries it seems impossible that people I talk to would not know.  If you are very rich, I guess you can jump on a plane and surprise people.  Not saying that as a negative.", "Yeah I just didn\u2019t want her creating a scene with the fact that I had a guy staying over for example last year for my husbands death anniversary we both visited an orphanage in Africa and stayed there for a week to help out and the orphanage manager was interested in me and she got very negative and defensive about it along with very direct passive aggressiveness", "I definitely get that I think she gets that too it\u2019s just that she\u2019s like a mother to me and I essentially left her at the door and she then struggled to find a place to stay for hours and then I had to lie and all", "So she expects you to mourn your husband for the rest of your life and eschew any form of fulfilling relationship?

That's life.\n\nYou didn't 'leave her at the door,' she made bad decisions about how to schedule her visit, and then needed to deal with the consequence of her choice to not, you know, make sure you were available.\n\nLack of planning on her part does not constitute a crisis on your part.", "This is why a frank discussion, even if difficult, would have made sense. (You could have sat outside or gone to a cafe.) You are an adult and that you feel like you should have to hide a man - for any reason - is sad and proof that you and she don't really have a close, honest relationship. It's one based on assumptions and expectations. \n\n*If you had been honest and she was upset, then it's about her and she clearly doesn't care about what you want or need. \n*If you had been honest and she was okay with it, then she cares about you and trusts you to make decisions that are best for you."]}
