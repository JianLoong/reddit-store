He has shown he can't keep it together. I definitely wouldn't invite him to my wedding and make it very clear he is not welcome.

I hope he will be able to clean himself up someday.", "NTA: As a Scottish man who has had 2 separate cocaine addictions. \n\nIf he shows up at your work, call the cops. It's against the law in both Ireland and Northern Ireland to be under the influence of a class A drug.\n\nHe is your fianc\u00e9's friend, not your problem.\n\nYour fiance is an enabler though and your marriage is going to go down the pipes for a number of reasons\n\n\n1: he actively enjoys watching his friend riot.\n\n2: his friend can and will die, I don't bother making friends with anyone who's willingly giving themselves a time limit to live anymore. I want a friendship for life, not anxiety buckaroo when their heart eventually starts giving out. You'll then have to console your partner, potentially for years for well, a guaranteed result he's too immature to see coming.\n\n3: Steaming is not the big culturally unique term your fianc\u00e9 seems to think it is, if he wants to enable his junkie pal (he is a junkie, there's no nice way to say it, people that use drugs instead of getting an actual personality are bizarre) let him, but don't marry him, or when said friend(s, by the sound of it) lives go down the pan, you'll be stuck housing them, and they'll still be doing it.\n\n\nGive them actual consequences, if your partner won't, it's not a partnership. Drug addiction is not a spectator sport.", "NTA\n\nI don't think you need to accept such behaviour at your wedding day. The friend had more then enough chances to show that he can behave well but didn't.", "NTA\n\nYou have every reason to be concerned.\n\n> I have said this to my partner, Any advice on how to deal with this?

He\u2019s gonna make a scene at the wedding though", "NTA \n\nStop inviting him!! Block him from your phones! Every single time you allow him to join you could be seen as enabling his behavior. So.Just.Stop.", "NTA - He is a trainwreck and it seems like he needs to hit rock bottom. Obvously he is not going to change doing the same things, so the best thing you can do for him is try to stay in his life and help, but not invite him to public outings anymore. He is drowning and trying to take you with him", "NTA\n\nHow many times does he get to break his promise and have the phrase \u2018childhood friend\u2019 do all the work?\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to reflect on whether he\u2019d treat *his* childhood friend\u2019s wishes like this.\n\nNTA for not wanting him at your wedding. Or at any event, ever.", "NTA - I had a friend like this when I was younger. With him it was alcohol, not cocaine.  He wasn't an alcoholic, but when he did drink it was full on binge, get blitzed, cause a scene, get himself/us into trouble. We had been friends since childhood so we talked about it but it never changed and eventually we just stopped including/inviting him places.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is why I stopped doing cocaine. Hell of a drug. Never again", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you all have to leave if you\u2019re sober or why him being trashed could get you fired. \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want him at my wedding day. You 100% know he will make it about himself", "NTA", "NTA- Y\u2019all need to start cutting him out your lives. He\u2019s going to ruin your wedding if he comes. He\u2019s also now not good company. Why is your partner still friends with him?", "Thanks for the honest words, I struggled with cocaine addiction myself (my partner did as well, and has also now stopped) for years, but have stopped completely, and it's very hard to be around someone who is doing it so blatantly.  The friend in question knows we are both recovering, so every time he shows up like this it's adding insult to injury in my eyes.  My partner is very fond of him, and seems to not have the balls to be straight up and give him an ultimatum", "My partner is just as furious as I am, this has happened so many times now, and it's embarrassing and makes everyone at the event look bad, let alone the fact that's it's an illegal class A drug.  But he has mixed feelings, as its his childhood best friend.  Its a tough one!", "He manages to drag about three or four of our other mutual friends down with him as well, every time without fail... I can see the wedding descending into chaos", "It's so hard.  I've been on the other side of that, struggling with my own addiction issues in the past, and I lost a lot of friends over it, and rightly so.  I've completely turned my life around however, and have managed to salvage a few of the friendships that I messed up..  So it's infuriating to have this behavior happen and no consequences happen for the friend.", "Well, you ever considered his friend is jealous of you both being clean? Most addicts, yourself previously included, are ashamed of the grip it has on them.\n\nIt sounds very much like a conscious effort on his part to get in the way. \n\nMaybe he's hoping an argument will cause his old buddy, old pal to relapse and he'll have his old sesh buddy back, not this new, boring responsible adult.\n\nGenuinely though, he shows up at your work, police, garda, St paddy, whatever, you get him to absolute fuck.\n\nSounds like a sinking captain trying to take the full ship down with him", "Then stage an intervention asap, and if that best friend doesn't accept that intervention and get help (i.e. going to a serious rehab facility, not just promising to stop being an idiot) then they don't get invited to the wedding.", "You deserve a wonderful day for your wedding, not worrying (or waiting) for your pal to go on a mad one. Maybe not inviting will be a wake up call for them. (Maybe consider security? If you think he\u2019d be likely to gatecrash the venue)", "Yeah it is tough for everyone. In our friend's case it wasn't an issue of addiction but just lack of self-control/not knowing his limits.  It was also really sad because obviously at some point he put the pieces together and realized that we were going to events/bars/parties without him and it opened up a \"wound\" in the friendship that never fully healed.  But ultimately for us it was necessary..like we can't keep having him cause big problems every time we try to hang out as friends.  I haven't seen him in 20 years because I moved away but the last time I was home visiting my buddies told me that he is largely still the same even now in his mid 40s....a nice guy and good friend who turns into an absolute sloppy, trouble-causing idiot the moment he has a drink.", "That makes a lot of sense, I think you're right about that.  Before me and my partner were together they were sesh buddies, so I'd imagine there's a good bit of resentment there. \n\nI'll clarify the work thing a bit, myself and fianc\u00e9 are musicians, and we do shows together, and he's come to our gigs out of it (in bars) so unfortunately it's not as easy as ringing the guards on him.  But managers in said venues have told us to not have him come back, and he clearly has annoyed customers ect. \n\nIt's not good.  I'm honestly fed up, and I knew that would happen yesterday \ud83e\udd26 even though my fianc\u00e9 AND his friend swore it wouldn't be that kind of day", "That's really well put, very sad situation, but you worded that quite well... The out of control drinking can be just as destructive as an addiction.  Knowing the limit is key, I wish there was more said about that to kids and young adults, or normalising having water or a non alcoholic drink in between, because I know so many people who can't handle a few drinks, or kinda slip away into fairyland after one too many drinks", "It sounds very very deliberate if you ask me\n\nI'd advise probably having a word with door staff, management at your venues, wee flash of a Facebook profile and just saying to not let him in, and say he WAS your friend but has substance issues that affect your professional lives.\n\nAlways put your own oxygen mask on first before the person next to you and all that.\n\nYour fiance is either an enabler or extremely naive, but he has other friends I assume, I might have judged him a bit harshly, but you can only skelp the mind your head sign so many times before you're going out of your way to pretend it's not there.", "Ah you're absolutely right.  I think my partner's gonna have a proper chat with him today, final warning job.  I doubt he's going to change, but I just can't have that carry on in my life anymore.  I'm sure you understand that exact feeling having gone through substance abuse issues, it's awful to be around if you've actually stopped altogether.  And I wouldn't ever slip up, but having someone (and the other three mates he manages to drag down) on it makes it so hard to keep that distance from said substance.", "I very recently did indeed cut all my addict friends out my life, after a pal who sold cannabis/green/dope whatever was making \u00a310,000 per month, then didn't have enough to pay a vet bill.\n\nI paid the emergency checkup (from my disability, told him not to pay me back), to find out the dog was fine on a facebook post.\n\nSome people just don't want to help themselves, and if he's actively dragging other folk with him, well then it extends beyond self destructive behaviour and everyone's at risk.\n\nAlso if you both keep giving him chances, he's going to keep at it, usually it's only the people at rock bottom who bother actually looking up to see where they came from. I'm not saying it's not a shame, it is, but it's also definitely not your problem as a grown couple with their whole life ahead of them. What sort of life is he going to make it, ae", "You need to have a chat with your partner too. They are almost endorsing this behaviour at this stage. I get it, it\u2019s hard to cut off an old friend especially when you keep hoping they\u2019ll change. \nAlso maybe these boundaries will give the friend a bit of a wake up call\n\nAlso knew you were Irish when I read \u201con the tear\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "That's shocking, people will say anything to get what they want if they have an addiction issue.  It's so sad, but unfortunately people have to learn a lesson the hard way.  I lost so many friends because of my own issues over the years, and I've managed to salvage one or two of them because I changed my behavior and cleaned my act up, but that took two or three years of serious self reflection and an iron will, so it's infuriating to me that this lad just gets a pass to do whatever he wants.  I don't know him well enough to be able to say anything, my fianc\u00e9 just needs to have the chat with him.  I'm all for second chances, if someone actually changes or shows any sign that they want to change. \nA friend of mine passed away there last week, most likely from substance abuse related issues, and it's shocking to me how people 'forget' that certain lifestyle choices affect people's health so badly, and carry on partying like they're 18.", "I mean, if he's your fianc\u00e9's childhood friend and you don't know much about him outside him taking loads of drugs, that in itself speaks volumes.\n\nOutside of the drugs, probably not much there.", "I hate to say it, but my fianc\u00e9 has actually said that if they weren't friends from such a young age, he wouldn't be friends with him now.  From what I know, he wasn't like this with the drugs until his mid 20s.  And the reason I even posted this is because I don't feel like it's my place to tell my partner who he can or can't be friends with, it's just that the behavior has gotten so put of hand I have to do something. \nAnd it's also about a wedding, my parents will be there (flying in from the states and not together), and my dad is a Buddhist, so he doesn't drink or take anything, he is also a probation officer and used to be a child protective service worker, and has staunch opinions about drugs.   On the other side of this, my mom is a party animal and would indulge in anything that was going, and I am literally having nightmares about how that could end up.  Fianc\u00e9's family are all lovely and well behaved, and I can only imagine they would not want to see the drama involved there \ud83d\ude02"]}
