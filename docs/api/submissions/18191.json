He stated it was my responsibility as his legal wife to go over to his house and care for him and the children. I honestly laughed because I thought he was kidding... he was not. I told him I will keep the children if it would help but otherwise it was not my issue.

This man is excruciating, congrats on your divorce. You weren\u2019t required to care for him even when you were still his wife. It\u2019s a nice thing to do for your partner, and most people wouldn\u2019t think twice, but it\u2019s not an actual requirement.

NTA. \n\nBaby's gonna baby.", "NTA... Not sure what culture that is, but it's a funny one. Once you are separated you lose privileges.

Good for you kicking him to the curb. Your mom is just upset because you had the guts to actually put your foot down and stand up for yourself. It\u2019d hard seeing others do something you know you never could.\n\nNTA- you\u2019re essentially divorced. He\u2019s no longer your issue.

He's gonna be single soon, so he'll be available.", "Misery loves company.", "Nice of her to make *your* divorce all about *her.*\n\n/s obviously lol", "Apparently, it is a non-contagious flu as your mother and children have been unaffected. \n\nGood for you for getting your own place.\n\nFrom his statement, it sounds like you made a good decision about the divorce.", "I was wondering as well since no one was worried about him being contagious.", "I would delete this comment and add (edit) your first comment.

Did someone cheat?  \n\nHe definitely should not have asked for help how he did. As the father of your children, you might want to ask him if he needs you to bring over soup and Gatorade. That way you are the better person. He might take this kind gesture with a grain of salt and start making your divorce easier. You also want to look good in your children's eyes.

What a ridiculous, desperate expectation. NTA.", "OMG NTA. he's an asshole for thinking his being sick is YOUR responsibility... it's NOT.", "NTA! As you said, the \u2018flu.
