Me (34f) and my husband (34m) are getting divorced. We are almost done with this process and it has been contentious. We have been living separate for over a year. Recently he got a stomach bug. He was struggling to care for the children on his days. Thursday he called my mother who went over to care for him and the children. I had the children on Friday as planned. He called me Saturday morning and told me he was still unwell. I offered to trade future days with him but he did not want that. He stated it was my responsibility as his legal wife to go over to his house and care for him and the children. I honestly laughed because I thought he was kidding... he was not. I told him I will keep the children if it would help but otherwise it was not my issue. He told me this is why I would not be able to have a successful relationship because I am not able to give of myself for others. I thought I was in the right but my parents took his side and were actually mad at me for \"letting him suffer\". But he had a flu, which sucks but is not overly serious. They are not talking to me ... aitah?\n\nEdit for Info: I have been getting these questions so I thought I would put them up here. \n\nMy marriage ended mainly because of disrespect. The best example is that he regularly called me trash. I dealt with it and even believed it for a while and tried to get better. When my daughter (5) began also calling me trash I knew I had to leave.\n\nWe did do marriage counseling and I have been in therapy for years. He has no interest and says it kills the natural masculinity and feminine nature.\n\nMy parents have been married for 41 years. They do not believe in divorce. When I left my mom became very mad because my father does many of the same things to her and she takes it as an attack on their relationship that I left.\n\nTo the people who ask if he would do the same for me he has not historically. Actually the opposite, I had to drive myself to the ER 5 times, including both child births, 2 serious illnesses, and one concussion so bad I was unconscious for over 5 minutes. He also never visited even when I was hospitalized for over a week.", "created_utc": 1685070440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13s1k8c/aitah_for_not_taking_care_of_my_sick_husband/", "score": 5874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They take it as a personal attack on their parenting because that\u2019s how their simple brains work.", "There haven't been any actual formal studies on it, but I've heard a lot of anecdotes from trans-men who were never phased by colds and such before they started HRT, and after HRT they feel like they're dying from a minor rhinovirus! So it might be testosterone related!", "TIL !", "Or maybe it IS covid, but treated as \"just a cold/flu\".", "NTA. 1000% not. And girl- way to go. Seriously, breaking the cycle of abuse is hard. Good for you. You just did an amazing thing for yourself and your daughter. You taught her not to put up with that shit. Highest of high fives.", "Your soon-to-be ex-husband is gaslighting you with the help of your parents? Thank God you already have 1 foot out the door. From now on, all communication is about the children only, via text!", "NTA\n\nYou've been separated for a year, he is no longer your problem. Your only responsibility is towards the kids.\n\nYour parents need to stay in their own lane and concentrate on their own marriage, not yours.", "Thank you for breaking the cycle. The fact your mom puts up with it and expects her child toas well speaks volumes on how much damage has been done. Your daughter deserves better and will surely get better now.\n\nNTA. At all. You are my hero.", "NTA, \n\nand his behavior here is why you should never, ever evereverever \"come to your senses\"!  Do you!  And smile while you laugh. Loudly.", "Uggggh.  When my sister divorced her husband, my mother tried to set me up with him to keep him in the family.  What is it with parents that love your future ex more than you do?", "They really love HIM??? A man who called you TRASH???\n\nYour parents are more interested in keeping up appearances than they are in your emotional well-being. If they refuse to support you then it is totally okay to go low-to-no contact with them. Don't buy into the \"bUt ThEy'Re YoUr PAAAARENTTTS\" bullshit that people will feed you - there is zero need to put up with their toxic behavior. If they're so concerned about your pathetic ex's well-being then they are welcome to go take care of him.", "Next time they say that, tell them \"I wish you really loved *me* and I hope you'll come to *your* senses.\"", "When they say this to you simply respond with \u2018well he abuses your daughter so I find it odd that you love him\u2019 - it doesn\u2019t have to be physical to be abuse OP. \n\nYou\u2019re better off without him", "Your parents are being assholes. I\u2019d be like, \u2018well if you like him so much better adopt him and forget my name. You can see the kids on his time to, btw, since he\u2019s your son now. You won\u2019t be seeing them on mine so I suggest you start figuring that out with him.", "Honestly, my parents are the reason my own separation is taking so long and so much therapy.  Flying Monkeys are real, and evidently can come from even our own side of the family. :(  Hang in there.  You are NTA", "Are we related by chance? My mom used to yell at me for not getting mine a supper plate. Even when I worked the night before.", "Sounds like they\u2019re a little delusional; their number one priority should be YOUR happiness and health, not his. Wtf.", "my parents would probably do the same, tbh. we have a generally good relationship, but my mom has some really traditional ideas about wive's roles that she has a hard time letting go of. she thinks i should fill his plate when we eat at their house, etc. it's annoying but i tend to just ignore it because they are not part of the situation. i would try to keep your parents out of future updates like this... like, unless your ex is calling them, how do they even know he has the flu?", "Then they can be the ones to step up since they love him so much.", "I think I understand why you are getting divorced. Stay the course if you do it now it will never end because your children will connect you. You\u2019re parents need to get a serious grip. NTA", "NTA at all. This is why you\u2019re getting divorced. So you don\u2019t have to put up with this man\u2019s bs on a daily basis. This is why HE is never going to have a successful relationship. \nGood job taking out the trash but also, your parents needs some tough love too", "Good for you for getting out. Shame your mother decided to let herself be hurt by your strength instead of being inspired to demand better herself.\n\nDon\u2019t let them drag you down. Keep your freedom and your self respect even if it means losing them too. You do NOT deserve abuse, and your ex is abusive.", "Where you married to a Steven Crowder clone? I bet he is also upset that you were allowed to be divorced.", "You did the right thing in this situation. He couldn\u2019t even respect in you in marriage now he wants you to respect and help him. Nope, he can sit alone in the virus infected bad he created. He is definitely the Ahole.", "Why is everybody glossing over the fact that he is contagious and kids should not be anywhere near him?!", "I swear if I ever got divorced my mom would definitely pick my hubby over me. She likes him way more! She\u2019d probably put him in her will instead, lol.", "It\u2019s just so weird. It\u2019s absolutely more my grandma than my dad (I can imagine him feeling awkward essentially telling her to piss off) and she just doesn\u2019t give a shit how it makes the rest of us feel. My sister and I hate it (and my parents got divorced when I was 10 and she was 8, so this started when we were little kids still)", "Jeez! Even the Catholic Church allows for physical separation and legal divorce in cases of abuse even if they won\u2019t grant an annulment of the sacrament. How fucked up do you have to be to disagree with a church that believes marriage is indissoluble?", "Hoping your cousin got away and went LC with aunt?", "Same. First time my ex did something mean crazy, his sweet dad asked me what I did to cause it. Sweet or not, I see where the problem came from.", "Jesus said divorce is not ideal but it's allowed because humans are so sinful and treat each other like garbage. Yeah that's paraphrased. I think the phrase is \"due to the hardness of men's hearts.\" \n\nYour husband can suck it. He wants his independence? He got it.\n\nTell him trash can't take care of sick people. You're too incompetent! Sorry!  His choices are to switch days with you or deal with it himself. He doesn't get a third choice. I bet he's an even worse dad when he's sick.\n\nTell your parents to stay out of it if they still want to see their grandchildren. They don't get to encourage your abuser and the future abuser of their grandchildren, when you are fighting uphill to make a better life for them that's free (half the time I guess) from emotional abuse.", "But at least it's not a hurty knee!", "I'm laughing so hard here...", "Oh its real. One of the times my ex had man flu, he was obviously dying while laying on the couch. I made myself lunch and sat down next to him. He asked me where his was. I replied \u201cYou have a cold, not broken legs. Make your own!\u201d He got up, made his lunch, all while grumbling about being sick. \n\nHe later complained to my sister, who told him that he was preaching to the choir and not expect me to have a bedside manner.", "I will say that this is actually really interesting, thanks for sharing.", "That's really interesting. Thank you for sharing!\n\nThat's also extremely true and valid, and I will say that my experience of menstruation definitely rivals my experience of the man flu. I'm not sure if that's because my experience of menstruation was particularly bad or about on par with average, but it sucked regardless, and worse than man flu in that it happens much more regularly to people. I recall a lot of pain on top of getting anaemia (that sometimes did require medical intervention, but not often), and I was often bedridden for a solid week, which really adds up and interferes with your quality of life when it's happening each month.\n\nIf he wouldn't return the favour, he shouldn't be expecting that kind of care from her. It's so bizarre that her parents took care of him and expect her to as well.", "Hell yeah....  try not getting sick for 3 years and then getting a cold!  It sucks!", "NTA. But are you married to Steven Crowder?\n\nWhat a weird controlling thing to ask of you. Are you sure he doesn't have some mental issues?", "*My marriage ended mainly because of disrespect. The best example is that he regularly called me trash. I dealt with it and even believed it for a while and tried to get better. When my daughter (5) began also calling me trash I knew I had to leave.*\n\n*My parents have been married for 41 years. They do not believe in divorce. When I left my mom became very mad because my father does many of the same things to her and she takes it as an attack on their relationship that I left.*\n\nNo one should have to put up with disrespect in any relationship. Your daughter was watching and learning how to treat you - just as you watched how your mother was treated and learned how to be treated.\n\nBravo to you for ending this cycle of abuse. If your father regularly belittles your mother, he is an abuser.  Your mother most likely can not face the fact that she is being abused   \n so she has to put the blame on you instead of taking a close look at her own marriage. Refuse to take the blame. Point out that your soon to be ex is an abuser and you saw the effect it was having on your daughter so you had to leave. Just because you stay with someone for 41 years doesn't mean that the marriage is happy and successful. Your mother might not have had a choice back then but she does now.", "Also, the unwritten rule is that you don't share kids if one of you has been sick.  If your ex husband took care of the kids while sick, the kids should stay with him until A) they get sick and get better or B) don't get sick for 48 hours after he is no longer contagious.  \n\nIt gets a lot harder to co-parent when you're \\*both\\* sick.", "You are to be commended for breaking the cycle. Your mom wants you to carry the karmic burden of what she's endured. She's suffering like \"a good wife\", therefore - you should too. Her anger is a \"How dare you!\" for having the bravery she wishes she had. Your kids won't have to endure this. You've broken the endless loop of domestic abuse and old fashioned servitude your ancestors have suffered and passed down to your parents. That's hero stuff right there.", "I was waiting for that kind of comment. Influenza is the only illness that ever wallops me, and when it does (and I get vaccinated!), it's miserable. Breathing is difficult. OP's can't-be-an-Ex-soon-enough is being a whine machine and her parents are awful.", "My parents and extended family religion doesn't believe in divorce. That marriage is FOREVER.  My cousin was nearly disowned when she divorced her husband.  She wanted to wait on kids and he thought they should be on their 3rd or 4th by now.  \n\nMy parents just divorced this year.  They were married for 43 years.  I live very far away and am rather low contact so I don't know all the details though I know some. Neither of my parents is a bad person they just weren't right for each other (I could have told them that years ago).", "I used to be glad my dad wasn\u2019t a Man Flu sufferer (my brother is so I unfortunately am familiar with it), but now he\u2019s older I kind of wish he was. He\u2019s more of the \u201cI\u2019m an Invincible Man, being sick happens to other people\u201d type so it\u2019s impossible to get him to rest. Until he\u2019s too sick to get out of bed, at which point he finally agrees that _maybe_ he should take it easy for a couple days.", "Then tell your parents they can go with your husband  in the divorce settlement. I'm not going to tell you what to do on this, but if it were me - I'd disconnect from them for a while and only see them when you drop off the kids.  Apparently, they cultivate and enable this behavior - so they them all hang out. I do worry about their effect on your kids.", "Speaking of trash.", "It is!\ud83d\ude0d Thank you for sharing it with us!", "It's a small price. There are benefits, such as no longer going through menstruation and the pain/suffering that brings.", "That's amazing. \n\"Sorry, I'm trash, I'm incompetent to the point I can't help you.\" \nFunny how they change their minds as soon as it inconveniences them and they actually have to take care of themselves.", "Your ex husband is so soft. How embarrassing for him.", "I started HRT in 2016.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m in a very similar situation myself and you are right in the money", "Is your dad Angelica Pickles lol", "If mom sided with daughter she'd have to admit she is being abused herself but dad \"doesn't believe in divorce\"."]}
