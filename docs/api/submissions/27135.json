I was adopted at birth. They couldn't have their own children. With that being said, my mom has been super involved in my pregnancy wanting all the details since she never got to experience it herself. So far it hasn't been an issue. She hasn't wanted to go to my appointments with us. I have sent her weekly updates on the size of baby and what new things baby is developing that week along with sharing all of my weird pregnancy symptoms etc. But, a friend of hers told her how cool the ultrasound scan is that you get half way through the pregnancy is and since then, my mom has wanted to come to this appt with hubby and I.\n\nA little bit of background. My grandmother was an extreme narcissist and because of this my mom will show those same narcissistic traits. Particularly, when she disagrees with a feeling you have about her. It was like walking on eggshells as a child and I learned to hide my feelings and lie about them in order to survive. Since then she has started taking medicine for her depression/anxiety and things have been a lot better. But she still has times where she will revert back to gaslighting and manipulation. Needless to say, she was never really the emotionally available parent.\n\nI don't want her at my ultrasound. For one I want to enjoy the moment with my husband just the two of us. And my last pregnancy ended in miscarriage. This pregnancy my biggest fear is going to this ultrasound and finding out I had lost the baby. After the miscarriage, she spent the next several months critisizing the amout of pregnancy tests I took.\n\nHere's where I might be the ass. In order to protect her feelings, I lied. I told her I could only have one person in the room with me. I knew I had pissed her off when she stopped talking to me. At this point, I didn't know she knew I had lied. So I thought maybe if I tell her while she can come in during labor, just not the pushing part, that it might make her feel better. Her response to this was \"I don't believe I will be there for any of it. I will just see the baby after ya'll get home.\" So I tell her I'd like for her to be there and the invitation is open. She replies that she does not feel welcome or wanted and she will \"back up and stay out.\"  This is when she says she knows I lied, that there can be 3 people in the room. I admit I lied and explained my reasoning and offered to video chat instead. She just keeps saying how its not like shes a stranger, implying she is not important to me, and how this has been so very very hard for her. I finally gave up trying to reason with her and told her I love her, she is important to me, and if she decides she wants pictures to let me know. I have not heard from her since. I can't help but think I could have handled the situation differently. However, if I hadn't lied the blow back would have probably been just as bad.\n\nAITA for not wanting my mom at my u/s?", "created_utc": 1695042882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lv90h/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_at_my_ultrasound/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am looking forward to having you meet your grandbaby.\"\n\nAnd OP, she is not going to take that well either. Because your mother wants to either get what she wants or be the victim.

My mother was like this and I can only thank the my lucky stars she was halfway around the world during my pregnancies and I also lied to her about my due date so she wouldn\u2019t try to come for the birth and early newborn days because it would have been all about her. This is a great place to practice holding your boundaries as she\u2019s not going to like being upstaged by your baby.", "Your grandmother may have been a narcissist, but your mother is emotionally manipulative. She will guilt trip you till she gets what she wants, how she wants things, and if things don\u2019t happen the way she wants it\u2019s the silent treatment, or another guilt trip as punishment. \n\nTime for you to get a shiny spine, and stick up for yourself, for your own feelings and wants. If you don\u2019t do it now, it won\u2019t get any easier once she wants to be in the delivery room, or visit you everyday when all you want is to rest and recover while bonding with your partner and baby, just the 3 of you.", "Nta. Your mom didn't kinda sorta pick up some narcissistic habits. She's a narc and she's making your pregnancy about her. Stop lying. Stop making excuses. You are fully entitled to have whoever you like at your appointments and certainly at the birth. Why are you negotiating away your boundaries with her?", "NTA, but enjoy the silence while it lasts. She's going to go full narcissist when that baby is born.", "You can put up that boundary and still be a good person. No means no.\n\nI would also reconsider having her at the birth since this is your first baby. It's impossible to describe what is both a medical ordeal and a highly emotional journey in advance, but suffice to say that no one benefits from having a mother who is often difficult there.\n\nTake her at her word and let her know when baby is out and everyone is cleaned up. Resist her offer to move in for a few weeks to 'help'.", "NTA, you have valid reasons for not wanting her there, and even if you didn't, you still have the right to choose who will be there for your medical condition, when you have scans done and when you have major procedures (giving birth). \n\nYou have given her options to still allow her to be involved, just not the level of involvement she'd like. She's going nuclear and saying if she doesn't get it all, she may as well have nothing. She's sabotaging herself and her chances", "Of course not.", "NTA You are the mom you get decide who gets to go where.", "Move forward with kind honesty and don\u2019t do things out of F.ear O.bligation G.uilt- you get to live your life and she can deal with whatever her feelings about it are", "NTA. She's playing the victim to get what she wants, but you don't owe her anything. You lied so she wouldn't get upset, she still got upset. That being said, you clearly don't want her there, so protect your own emotional wellbeing first, and tell her where to go if she complains.", "NTA. Don't waste any more time trying to reason with your mother as you know it won't go well. Just tell her, \"Suit yourself\" and don't let it bother you--it's pretty obvious that she kinda enjoys getting under your skin, so your recourse would be to show that you actually don't care one way or another.", "NTA. I didn't want anyone other than my spouse at my ultrasound or my delivery. It's your body and your baby and you can decide who you let in.", "This is your marriage, your pregnancy and your body. You shouldn't have to lie to keep a grown woman from spiraling about YOUR doctor's appointment. I urge you to take advantage of this break, because once you have the baby, she'll ramp up a LOT. Use this as a reset and really work to not to give her the reaction she wants, which is you giving up your own needs and comfort for her preferences. \n\nNTA. Defend your peace.", "NTA, but you should've just told her your reason upfront", "Plus, the 20 week scan is often the one where (and absolutely not saying there is OP!) if something is wrong you find out, and given her mother's response to her miscarriage I wouldn't want her in the room if it was me. The last person who should be with you if you get bad news is someone so critical and manipulative.", "Agreed. NTA and decide for yourself where your energy goes. Don\u2019t let her play these games. Enjoy the silence and her not being present and narcissistic at your birth. Don\u2019t let her get to you", "I definitely have a mother like this. No matter what you do, it will never be enough. Stick to your boundaries so at least one of you is comfortable. If you give in, the only difference will be that you're both unhappy.", "Usually the 20 week scan is the second one actually.   There's usually an earlier intra vaginal ultrasound early on to make sure baby is in the right place, count how many there are, etc.  The 20 week scan is more visually interesting,  though, and it's when you can find out the sex of the baby.", "Lies have little legs, as OP has found out.  OP, you have to figure out how to set boundaries rather than making it lies.  And don't back down from them.  Honestly you shouldn't have offered to video call her from the ultrasound after this all blew up.", "SO TRUE! Also, this is a crucial moment as you\u2019ll start your motherhood journey. Make the right choices as a new mother. Who do you want to be? I had to keep my mother at arm\u2019s length from my daughters. Didn\u2019t want her energy close to them. And I didn\u2019t want to turn into her.", "Maybe where you are. Transvaginal ultrasounds are only performed in Canada if there is a concern early on. If not, the first, and only ultrasound is around 20 weeks.\n\nAfter that if you are high risk you may go for fetal assessment ultrasounds or people pay privately for gender reveal ultrasounds.", "In Ontario there's a dating ultrasound when you find out you're pregnant, then the 20 week ultrasound for anatomy and that would be the gender reveal if your baby is cooperative."]}
