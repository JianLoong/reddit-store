I was adopted at birth. They couldn't have their own children. With that being said, my mom has been super involved in my pregnancy wanting all the details since she never got to experience it herself. So far it hasn't been an issue. She hasn't wanted to go to my appointments with us. I have sent her weekly updates on the size of baby and what new things baby is developing that week along with sharing all of my weird pregnancy symptoms etc. But, a friend of hers told her how cool the ultrasound scan is that you get half way through the pregnancy is and since then, my mom has wanted to come to this appt with hubby and I.\n\nA little bit of background. My grandmother was an extreme narcissist and because of this my mom will show those same narcissistic traits. Particularly, when she disagrees with a feeling you have about her. It was like walking on eggshells as a child and I learned to hide my feelings and lie about them in order to survive. Since then she has started taking medicine for her depression/anxiety and things have been a lot better. But she still has times where she will revert back to gaslighting and manipulation. Needless to say, she was never really the emotionally available parent.\n\nI don't want her at my ultrasound. For one I want to enjoy the moment with my husband just the two of us. And my last pregnancy ended in miscarriage. This pregnancy my biggest fear is going to this ultrasound and finding out I had lost the baby. After the miscarriage, she spent the next several months critisizing the amout of pregnancy tests I took.\n\nHere's where I might be the ass. In order to protect her feelings, I lied. I told her I could only have one person in the room with me. I knew I had pissed her off when she stopped talking to me. At this point, I didn't know she knew I had lied. So I thought maybe if I tell her while she can come in during labor, just not the pushing part, that it might make her feel better. Her response to this was \"I don't believe I will be there for any of it. I will just see the baby after ya'll get home.\" So I tell her I'd like for her to be there and the invitation is open. She replies that she does not feel welcome or wanted and she will \"back up and stay out.\"  This is when she says she knows I lied, that there can be 3 people in the room. I admit I lied and explained my reasoning and offered to video chat instead. She just keeps saying how its not like shes a stranger, implying she is not important to me, and how this has been so very very hard for her. I finally gave up trying to reason with her and told her I love her, she is important to me, and if she decides she wants pictures to let me know. I have not heard from her since. I can't help but think I could have handled the situation differently. However, if I hadn't lied the blow back would have probably been just as bad.\n\nAITA for not wanting my mom at my u/s?", "created_utc": 1695042882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lv90h/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_at_my_ultrasound/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am looking forward to having you meet your grandbaby.\"\n\nAnd OP, she is not going to take that well either. Because your mother wants to either get what she wants or be the victim.

It's not a first picture taking opportunity for the baby.", "My sister and I both had our husband and mom in the ultrasound appointment for our first baby, but we both have a solid relationship with our mom. \n\nI think it is just such a personal decision, I wouldn\u2019t demand to be there for my daughter (assuming she decides to be a parent).", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to come to your ultrasound. It is 100% your choice, and you don\u2019t need to explain it. Easier said than done, I know. You could say something like, \u201cJust Ben and I will\nbe at the ultrasound, but we\u2019ll share pictures with you afterward.\u201d And please don\u2019t feel obligated to invite her to your birth unless you truly want her there. \nGive her some time to get over her drama with ignoring you. She should only be involved as a support to you during your pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and not the other way around. Wishing you the best as you navigate this. It isn\u2019t easy!", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how often this has to be said but pregnancy and childbirth are not spectator sports. It sounds like your mother likes to be the main character and you\u2019ve gone and ruined it.

I totally get your situation and you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to have certain people in there with you, no matter how close they are to you", "NTA\n\nSince you no longer live under her roof would it be easier for you to stop censoring yourself for the sake of her feelings/reactions? Especially since you believe the blowback would have been just as bad if you hadn\u2019t lied. I think the rest of your reactions to her behavior have been very calm and mature. So I think you\u2019d be immune to any emotional blackmail. I think you\u2019d feel better if you were honest because the little lie seems to have stressed you out. \n\nEither way I don\u2019t believe you did anything wrong.

And being in your 20s when you grew up that way sometimes you have a hard time knowing how to address certain things.

Nobody needs to understand why you put certain things in place for yourself. If it makes sense to you then do that.", "This is so sad to me. I never got to raise a child to adulthood so I am not saying I am an expert. I can say the things we say to a child last a lifetime. Good or bad. You bring up an excellent point.
