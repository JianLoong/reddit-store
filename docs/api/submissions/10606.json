Your dad needs to get over it because if women were able to work it out and be happy then damn, a man should be good with that lol", "NTA.\n\nParents get the mistaken impression that step-siblings don't see each other as just another random person living in the house. Like of course you thought we were great fake siblings - you punished me for displaying anything otherwise. You did more for her inviting her to get paid than I would have, frankly.\n\nYour dad sounds like a real piece of work too.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding but your hatred / blame for your dads affair and breaking up the family should not be guided at her. She\u2019s an innocent bystander as are you.", "Nta cause it\u2019s your day and choice, but you should look into therapy because the real one you should resent is your stepmother , ahe didn\u2019t ask to be born and If she\u2019s only been kind to you and your dads already commit to her mother forever.. it would sure make your life easier to get over the feelings you are obviously holding onto.", "NTA the wedding part at least but I do suggest you go to therapy. You\u2019re blaming your step sister for something she hasn\u2019t done and had absolutely no control over, it would make sense if you hate your dad and step mom but your step sister is practically a victim too. I\u2019m not telling you to go be best friends with her, but definitely get rid of those negative feelings, she doesn\u2019t deserve them", "NTA. Your wedding, your invite, and it sounds like you came up with a solution that kept everyone happy.\n\nI do question why you direct your animosity for your dad's affair towards your stepsister ~~who was the innocent byproduct~~. He's the one who cheated, then divorced your mom and remarried his affair partner, but you don't mention any issues you have with him. Yet you have an immediate adverse relationship with your stepsister.\n\nEither there's more you're not telling us or you're being an AH in handling a sibling (and yes she is your sibling~~, by blood~~) relationship. You might need to think about whether you're directing your animosity to the right person.\n\nEDIT: corrected my misunderstanding of the affair and relationship to the stepsister.", "NTA. Not at all.\nIt's your wedding, your decision who to invite, it would've been more than Okay for you to just keep her away fully but instead you still included her and if she's even happy with the photo job then why is your father even complaining? It's nice of you to still include her like this even though you don't like her.", "NTA You have already done more than you had. You didn't have to include anyone you don't want to in your self-paid wedding party, but you were gracious enough to do so.", "So this stepsister is the innocent daughter of the asshole dad and now-stepmom that had an affair?\n\nIf I got that right...\n\nNTA. It's your wedding, your rules.\n\nBut jeez, if she's innocent in all of this, shouldn't you two understand each other better and have something to bond over instead of war about? (if I'm understanding what the relationships are of course)", "NTA, sounds like your father is the only one upset, and unfairly at that. You can\u2019t force the feeling of family and given the circumstances it\u2019s no surprise you never bonded with your step sis. It was actually very cordial of you to involve her in some way. \n\nBut also if she\u2019s taking photos (especially if she has experience) I hope your reimbursing her in some way and not just using her for free.", "NTA.  I have 2 step sisters and a step brother, that came along with my Dad\u2019s second wife.  Me and my sisters always lived with our Mom, and never lived with them.My Dad and step mom always tried to have us thing of them as true siblings; but it\u2019s like they were from another planet.  We were polite to step mom and her kids, but that\u2019s it.\n\nI hate it when parents try to force some relationship with step siblings, and you shouldn\u2019t have to go along with it.", "Nta and his paying is irrelevant", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, your father does not get a say just because he paid 20%.", "Nta, daddy needs to understand that time does not heal all wounds and his choices affected a lot of people, the only disspointing thing is that he created this situation and developed 0 skills to bring you girls together over the years.\n\n\nJust because he pays for 20% of the wedding does not mean he gets his way or that this event is the one to bring families together, but I think you would be better off without his money since it leaves room for him to feel \u201cdissapointed\u201d.\n\n\n\n Your stepsister is not the one who should be getting the wrath of your fathers poor choices, she is the victim of an irresponsible adult just as much as you are.", "Nta you found a role for her, don't feel obligated to embrace his mistakes/life choices.\n\nMake sure you still have a good primary photographer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not paying her would be an AH move. Your wedding party should be your closest friends and family, not a place to fulfill obligations.", "Eh... NAH bar your dad and his ap/current wife. Neither you nor your step sister asked for this. I'm going to assume that you are a decent, kind person to her even if you don't love her like you do your other siblings. That's all that's really required of you, just be respectful to the other human. Your step sister probably already understands why you feel the way you do, and has her own feelings about that situation. As long as you're not actively mean or cruel to her then I think you're probably okay.\n\nYour dad and his current wife... Wow. One, ballsy to marry the mistress. Two, even ballsier to try and force a sister relationship straight out the gate when she current wife was the reason your family broke apart. I personally would refund his 20 percent and do whatever the hell I wanted. When he had a complaint, he'd get told that since he couldn't respect his first marriage that maybe he should butt out and mind his business.", "Cold but deserved \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "The one he should resent (if any) is his dad.

I'm sorry it wasn't in the cards to have more with them though. \n\nI had a step parent growing up (unrelated to the reason for my parents divorce) and I would have loved to have a sibling, step or half. My bio dad actually had a short of step daughter with his long term girlfriend for a while but she didn't like me much because my dad would put me first when I was with him. She even tried to steal my then boyfriend, now husband!", "Why?", "Very true, but also if his partner knew he had a family she\u2019s just as bad for perusing the relationship with him. Either way it\u2019s nothing to do w the daughter and it\u2019s wild that OP has taken the stance of making her photographer instead of guest.", "Oh. I completely misunderstood. I thought the step sister was the father's child from the affair. Obviously not, otherwise she wouldn't be the step sister \ud83d\ude48. I'll edit my post accordingly.", "This, and it sounds as if the kids, at least OP, was older when this happened.", "Yes, the step siblings in my family never did have bad blood or arguments.  Step mom tried to get us girls to take responsibility for the step brother (he\u2019s disabled) so her own daughters wouldn\u2019t have to do it.  That was the only shit move that was ever attempted. Actually, step mom was the only problem, ever, and we were respectful and kind to her despite knowing she broke up our parents\u2019 marriage. Wow, how crummy is that for a step sister to put the move on your bf!", "Agreed.", "I don't think it's super clear, wouldn't worry about it. I thought I missed something!", "He just laughed. She tried to tell him that I'd baby trap him... As if I wouldn't be making my own life plans that much harder in the process. Such a joke."]}
