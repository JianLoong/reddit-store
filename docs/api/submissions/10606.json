Your dad needs to get over it because if women were able to work it out and be happy then damn, a man should be good with that lol", "NTA.\n\nParents get the mistaken impression that step-siblings don't see each other as just another random person living in the house.

You did more for her inviting her to get paid than I would have, frankly.\n\nYour dad sounds like a real piece of work too.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding but your hatred / blame for your dads affair and breaking up the family should not be guided at her. She\u2019s an innocent bystander as are you.", "Nta cause it\u2019s your day and choice, but you should look into therapy because the real one you should resent is your stepmother , ahe didn\u2019t ask to be born and If she\u2019s only been kind to you and your dads already commit to her mother forever.. it would sure make your life easier to get over the feelings you are obviously holding onto.", "NTA the wedding part at least but I do suggest you go to therapy. You\u2019re blaming your step sister for something she hasn\u2019t done and had absolutely no control over, it would make sense if you hate your dad and step mom but your step sister is practically a victim too. I\u2019m not telling you to go be best friends with her, but definitely get rid of those negative feelings, she doesn\u2019t deserve them", "NTA. Your wedding, your invite, and it sounds like you came up with a solution that kept everyone happy.\n\nI do question why you direct your animosity for your dad's affair towards your stepsister ~~who was the innocent byproduct~~. He's the one who cheated, then divorced your mom and remarried his affair partner, but you don't mention any issues you have with him. Yet you have an immediate adverse relationship with your stepsister.\n\nEither there's more you're not telling us or you're being an AH in handling a sibling (and yes she is your sibling~~, by blood~~) relationship. You might need to think about whether you're directing your animosity to the right person.\n\nEDIT: corrected my misunderstanding of the affair and relationship to the stepsister.", "NTA. Not at all.\nIt's your wedding, your decision who to invite, it would've been more than Okay for you to just keep her away fully but instead you still included her and if she's even happy with the photo job then why is your father even complaining? It's nice of you to still include her like this even though you don't like her.", "NTA You have already done more than you had. You didn't have to include anyone you don't want to in your self-paid wedding party, but you were gracious enough to do so.", "So this stepsister is the innocent daughter of the asshole dad and now-stepmom that had an affair?\n\nIf I got that right...\n\nNTA. It's your wedding, your rules.\n\nBut jeez, if she's innocent in all of this, shouldn't you two understand each other better and have something to bond over instead of war about? (if I'm understanding what the relationships are of course)", "NTA, sounds like your father is the only one upset, and unfairly at that. You can\u2019t force the feeling of family and given the circumstances it\u2019s no surprise you never bonded with your step sis. It was actually very cordial of you to involve her in some way. \n\nBut also if she\u2019s taking photos (especially if she has experience) I hope your reimbursing her in some way and not just using her for free.", "NTA.

Neither you nor your step sister asked for this. I'm going to assume that you are a decent, kind person to her even if you don't love her like you do your other siblings. That's all that's really required of you, just be respectful to the other human. Your step sister probably already understands why you feel the way you do, and has her own feelings about that situation. As long as you're not actively mean or cruel to her then I think you're probably okay.\n\nYour dad and his current wife... Wow. One, ballsy to marry the mistress. Two, even ballsier to try and force a sister relationship straight out the gate when she current wife was the reason your family broke apart.

I'm sorry it wasn't in the cards to have more with them though. \n\nI had a step parent growing up (unrelated to the reason for my parents divorce) and I would have loved to have a sibling, step or half. My bio dad actually had a short of step daughter with his long term girlfriend for a while but she didn't like me much because my dad would put me first when I was with him. She even tried to steal my then boyfriend, now husband!", "Why?", "Very true, but also if his partner knew he had a family she\u2019s just as bad for perusing the relationship with him.

Step mom tried to get us girls to take responsibility for the step brother (he\u2019s disabled) so her own daughters wouldn\u2019t have to do it.  That was the only shit move that was ever attempted. Actually, step mom was the only problem, ever, and we were respectful and kind to her despite knowing she broke up our parents\u2019 marriage.

Her mother is the one that forced you both to be sisters. Your parents had a divorce because your father had a child with his affair partner. Your step-sister did not ask to be born and (as far as we know) she has done nothing wrong to you besides simply existing. I suggest you either talk to her about your hatred for her and/or get counseling.", "NTA because you're allowed to have whoever you want in your wedding party.\n\nThat being said, you ARE the AH to your stepsister for no reason. Your father is the person who was responsible for ending his marriage to your mother.\n\nAlso, your stepsister never asked for it either. You're projecting your anger onto your stepsister because she was an easy target for you to misplace your anger instead of really at the person who is the blame - your father.", "I mean it's not the girls fault that the family fell it's the father's.

And your dad is a HUGE EFFING AHOLE for not just cheating on your mom but then pressuring you to be somehow okay with it.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. From her perspective you\u2019re a sister that hates her, and you hate her because of nothing that she did, and that has to SUCK for her. I\u2019m not saying you NEED to make her a big part of your wedding, but moving forward I think you need to find a way to either cut that entire side of your family out of your life so she doesn\u2019t have to feel like the one person in your family that doesn\u2019t deserve kindness or stop punishing her for what your dad did to you.", "YTA. You can say no. You should be honest with her and not get her hopes up, your sister is just an innocent in this as you.", "NTA\n\nEveryone involved is happy, so why is Dad pushing this?

This is your day & you shouldn't be forced to include someone in your wedding that you have no feelings for.

Op doesn't have to be uncomfortable because her dad decided to bang stepsister's mom", "I don't get people blaming the affair partner. If there's anyone to blame, it's your own parent. The other person was a stranger to you (except when they're not, but that's another story). \n\nEven then, there's a difference between cheaters who don't intend to get caught and people who cheat hoping to get caught (because they are too much of a coward to tell their partner the relationship is over for them).\n\nSo much of these \"blame the affair partner\" seems to be based on \"men are weak and women are temptresses\" bullshit. You rarely see that ire aimed at stepfathers."]}
