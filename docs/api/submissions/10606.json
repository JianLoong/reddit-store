But weird logic.", "I wasn't clear on that either,", "r/subsifellfor", "Stepsister, not half sister", "Being asked to perform an important task and bring paid for it is not punishment.  Stepmom and stepsis are both happy with the inclusion.", "Why do people think that not doing anything you want to do ever is a \"punishment\"?", "I do hope OP has checked the details on whether the affair went on long enough for the step to actually be her half sister. The whole \"her mom told her we were sisters\" thing could be interpreted in more than one way, after all.", "If the two have the same father,  they are half sisters. If they are not biologically related,  they're stepsisters. Right?", "Oh, gross.  Yeah, you're right.\n\nI feel terrible for OP.", "Blaming the affair partner has nothing to do with gender. Married women cheat too, and people don't only cheat with the opposite sex so your point really doesn't make sense. \n\n\nPeople who knowingly romantically/sexually pursue a married person, have shit morals. They know a family is involved and that people will be hurt by their actions but their selfish intentions matter more. The people innocently affected by that kind of thing, like children of divorce or the faithful spouse, don't owe any affair partner kindness or grace.", "As blunt as this sounds. Unless he has a magic penis, It doesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s a home wrecker. It\u2019s perfectly ok to see your parents affair partner as a home wrecker, and see your parent as one too.", "100% agreed. The person who\u2019s IN the relationship should be blamed (the dad in this case). They\u2019re the one who made the commitment to the family and promised to be monogamous, then broke that promise. I too hate this \u2018good man being led astray by evil woman\u2019 bs.", "And for her stepsister / halfsister. \ud83d\ude14", "In this sub, it seems like \"affair partner\" is almost always used to describe women. Mothers who cheat are also pilloried, but their partners much less (they seems to be generally hated for being awful stepfathers, but far less for tempting poor helpless women).\n\nStep back and look at the threads here over time. Each one is an individual, but taken together it looks like sexism.", "But why is \"home wrecker\" almost always applied to women? Just chance? I don't think so.\n\nThere's nothing in this post that says that the stepmother knew OP's father was married when they got involved. But people seem to accept that fact without question.", "The person who is in the marriage is more at fault, but people who sleep with married people (men or women), knowing they are participating in the breakup of a marriage, particularly when children are involved, are shitty people. They are also at fault.\n\nNot at fault? The stepsister. She had no more choice in the situation than OP did, and it would be good if OP could bring herself to realize that and aim her resentment at the correct targets.", "Respectfully, that hasn't been my experience in the 2+ years I have been reading this sub. I would say mine has been, cheaters are always hated no matter what. I would even say that once cheating has been mentioned, the actual AH situation is less likely to matter and the cheater is most likely to be named the AH no matter what."]}
