For this we will call my mom's husband Jim.\n\nMy dad died in front of my mom and me when I was 6. It was traumatic as hell. My mom and I both went to therapy for three years as a result of what we saw. A year after dad died mom met Jim and fell in love with him. He helped mom heal in a way therapy wasn't able to. The way nobody else could. Jim and I got along pretty well. At times he tried a bit too hard to be a parent when he and my mom were still just dating and at times it felt like he wanted way more from me than I did from him. Before their wedding when I was 8 he and my mom told me they wanted to know if I would like to be adopted by Jim and to call him dad. I said no. Jim asked me if that was likely to change, I said no again. They did drop it and to their credit, never pushed after that.\n\nWhen I was 9 my mom had a baby boy and a year later she had a baby girl, followed by another baby boy a year later. I do love my half siblings. But I have always called them my half siblings. Mom asked me why I used half and I told her because we had different dad's. She told me that didn't make them half, that we still had the same mom, and even if we didn't, and they were Jim's kids with someone else, we were still family, still siblings now and using half or step for siblings was a little mean when you're so much older than them. It was a topic that came up time and time again.\n\nTwo months ago my mom and Jim decided the three of us needed to do family therapy together. It was there that not only was my using half brought up, but the fact I bounced between stepdad and mom's husband for Jim, and that I never called him dad or let others credit him as my dad. The therapist and I had talked solo and she talked to mom and Jim without me too. She helped guide me through some of what I had said to her. The questions were basically, why half, why is it bad for Jim to be known as dad, why can't that make me happy. So to sum up what I said. I told them that I love my half siblings, but we have different dad's and I don't ever want that to be forgotten, because I love and miss my dad and don't want him erased. That no matter how great Jim is, he is not my dad. That I'm glad mom has him since dad's gone. But it's important for me to let it be known I'm my dad's daughter, not Jim's and that it's a feeling that isn't changing for me, that I don't want it to change. That I'm still happy with how things are.\n\nMom and Jim were so unhappy with me for saying that. They said I was wasting everyone's time and their money if I was adamant about not working through my feelings on that and learning how to accept Jim can still be my dad and my siblings can be just siblings and it doesn't erase my dad. I said I didn't need that to happen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678700551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q59ca/aita_for_being_honest_about_how_i_feel_and_for/", "score": 1065, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I truly don't get why that is so important for your mother and stepdad. It is the way, it is, and nothing they can do can rewrite history. Does your mother really want that?

Therapy is for getting real feelings out, not \"getting with the program\". Your Mom and Jim should respect your feelings. They're butt hurt that your feelings won't change. I don't blame you. You have clear boundaries with respect for your Dad. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   \nIt sounds like they don\u2019t like it when they put in effort and don\u2019t get what they wanted.  \nIt\u2019s not YOUR fault THEY are wasting their time and resources chasing something you are perfectly entitled to feel.", "NTA. I commend you for you maturity in communicating your needs to your mom and step dad. Your reasons are thoughtful, deliberate, and not malicious. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s actually kind of sweet that your step-dad is hurt, because it means he cares about you and how you think of him. He and your mom just aren\u2019t doing a very good job at keeping their hurt to themselves so you aren\u2019t put in a position where you feel responsible for it.\n\nIf you believe he is good to you, maybe there is an honorary title you\u2019d be comfortable with, that you can propose as a compromise?\n\nMaybe there\u2019s an affectionate and special honorary you can propose for your half siblings as well?\n\nSomething to think about if you feel comfortable with the idea.", "NTA.

I hope you can find a way to love and remember your dad without making your siblings and Jim feel like less because they didn\u2019t know him and didn\u2019t see your bond with him. It\u2019s great that you appreciate him for everything he has done to help your mom move on. Yes I think your mom and Jim need to accept your feelings when it comes to calling him dad but you need to stop calling your siblings step or half. That is probably hurting your mother something fierce. She loves them the same way she loves you and that label you give them is hurtful to all. Even if you think that way you can keep it to yourself. Good luck!", "Your mother and her husband cannot buy you changing your mind.  Any therapist that tries to help them and not you is unethical.", "No assholes. \n\nI think it's unfair that you've been shunned for being honest and I totally understand not wanting to call your step dad your dad. My step dad is better than my real dad yet I still call him his name and he knows how much I appreciate him. I will however say I can understand from their point of view, this seems like something thats come up in conversation a lot and your adamant on your decision, they may feel like you don't want to be part of the family - I'm not saying this is true but I'm just trying to see from their side too. To them it must feel like you don't want to cooperate or want them to also feel okay and that whatever your decision is, is final.\n\nThe only thing I can say, and can see other people have mentioned is the half sibling talk - I think when it comes to this you're focusing a lot of how you feel about this situation, and due to your siblings being young as well they aren't going to have alot of understanding to why you want to call them half siblings. \n\nFrom my own experince its very hurtful to be called just a half sibling, even if thats the truth of it. I saw you reply to someone else saying you feel most comfortable calling them that, but also remember how they may feel about it too.\n\nof course everyone is different and maybe your siblings won't mind it, but as someone who has four sisters and has been called a \"half sibling\" a lot, it hurts a bit because it feels like you aren't a REAL sibling to them and in a way feels like a weapon.\n\nIt might be different in my case due to circumstances, but just keep it in mind for the future - its important to do whats best for you but you also have to take into consideration what other people feel too, and here I'm mostly concerned about your siblings.\n\nYour mum and step dad seem to be focusing on what they want more than focus on how to help everyone, but saying that it seems that you are also just focusing on what you want here too. No one is trying to work to make sure everyone is okay and focusing all on themselves.\n\nQuick after thought: No one really speaks to their siblings like \"Hi there sibling\" so I am beginning to think that you call them your half siblings to make some sort of statement, which I understand due to your trauma but much like other people have said you really need to do more extensive therapy.", "NTA.\n\nI may not understand your feelings on this, my stepdad was \"dad\" and my half-brothers were always just \"brothers\", but I can't say that you are being an AH by having those feelings. You aren't. And your mother and stepdad aren't AHs for their feelings on the matter, but the way they are dealing with it *does* make them AHs. \n\nNow, I don't feel that calling Jim \"dad\" and dropping the \"half\" toward your siblings would be erasing your father. I also think that it is possible to have more than one person you call dad, because being a dad is more than about blood. *However*, it would not be right of me to try to force you to agree with me on that - and this is why Jim and your mum are AHs.\n\nHow you feel is important and needs to be respected, even if they don't agree with it.", "NAH.\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way, and they learn to cope with that grief in their own way.\n\nYour mom seems to have found comfort and new happiness in Jim, and that's fine.\n\nYou seem to have reconciled with your dad's death up to a point - you want to make sure he isn't forgotten, and that's fine.\n\nWhat might be the real issue is that the way you and your mother are handling that residual grief may be butting against each other. Where you see the use of stepfather and half-siblings as just a statement of fact, you might accidentally be rubbing salt in your mom's wounds that Jim is not her first husband - and conversely, her trying to get you to stop giving these distinctions seems to be accidentally stomping on your desire to honor your dad.\n\nIf I could give a small piece of advice, I would recommend trying to shift the focus of your group therapy sessions to discover the emotional drives behind your respective desires and/or attempting to find a some mutual understanding that can help you both find a middle ground. (Jim might also benefit from some private sessions to cope with his feelings about the step/dad situation.)", "I feel like this isn't a topic for this subreddit. You can't ask if you are an AH or they are. Everyone's feelings in this situation are valid to some degree. \n\nIt is perfectly understandable that you want to keep your deceased father's memory alive. That the trauma of losing him is still there. I feel that you need to pursue further therapy on loss and grief, perhaps group therapy with others who have similar loss. \n\nIn regards to your parents. Your mother very much wants a cohesive family unit. The loss of your father hit her hard too, but she found the ability to move on with someone who obviously cares. \n\nJim has, from your own statement, made overtures to accept you as his child. That doesn't mean that he wants to erase your father from your memory. He just wants to forge forward with making the rest of your life happy and memorable. It probably hurts him that his efforts and feelings aren't being validated. But until you are willing to accept your father's passing (which you arent there yet) you won't be able to accept Jim's feelings.\n\nAs for your siblings, they are your siblings and calling them anything but is weaponizing your negative feelings towards your parents and possibly those kids. After all they are children too and have nothing to do with your trauma. But your actions towards them can leave lasting effects on your relationship with them for decades to come.", "Well. This is a mixed bag for me. NTA for not wanting to call Jim dad but the half brother's thing seems a bit AH. They are your brother and sister.\n\nYou really need therapy. You seem to have a lot of issues and some resentment towards Jim and your siblings. Also I think you didn't process the lost of your father.", "I am getting flamed for this one but i think you should comply a bit more\n\nJim has never wanted you to forget your dad, at all. He wants the torch your father held to be passed to him, as a guardian. He knows he isnt your biological father, but he is trying to fill your fathers shoes FOR YOU so that you wouldnt feel a void. An appropriate Analogy would be he is subbing for your dad, whos out of a football game for an injury. He isnt as good, but he gets the job basics done\n\nIf he didnt care for you,he wouldnt have tried this much. I am not saying do everything like hes your actual father from now, but i really believe you should at least try baby steps. Hes making an attempt, try reciprocating it for a bit once?\n\nThis is just my opinion, but if your thoughts on the situation are firm, then theres no changing that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not about them at all, really.", "I see absolutely nothing in the post, that suggests she is 'resentful'. You're simply assuming that, because you don't agree on her decision to use 'half'. But frankly, I find that attitude towards her patronising (i.e. your assumption that there must be something 'wrong' with her emotions in some way, because her opinion on this doesn't align with yours). \n\nYour comment that she 'really needs therapy', is also based on your disagreement with her choice of words (and the baseless assumptions you make, about the reasons behind her word choice). Therapy should NOT be abused as a way to 'problematise' somebody's beliefs/behaviour, etc., just because they take a different viewpoint to you (which, incidentally, Jim and her mother are also doing). \n\nThere isn't necessarily a 'right' or 'wrong' answer in these situations. But I do see her logic in using 'step' and 'half'. She simply wants to honour her Dad - and feels like the use of 'step' and 'half' helps with that. That's because referring to Jim as 'Dad' (and the siblings as just 'siblings'), may well give the impression there was no other Dad before Jim. \n\nAnd she doesn't want that. I don't see any automatic 'resentment' in that. People choose different ways to honour lost loved ones. And indeed - if words are so unimportant for denoting family relationships (to the point she should simply be comfortable dropping the 'half' and 'step'), then why does it matter so much to her Mom and Jim, that she drop those words?! \n\nThey are acting like she is denying the family relationships/family unity- when she isn't. Even referring to them as 'half' and 'step', reflects that they are a family. And why does the term 'half-sibling' have to imply any less love and bonding? It simply acknowledges there was another parent involved originally. So I say leave the kid alone. She simply wants to keep her father acknowledged in the family, and this is one of the ways she does it.", "I believe a more appropriate analogy would be Jim is coming in the game after the starting pitcher is out.

They are abusing the purpose of therapy, i.e. they are trying to problematise you, simply for having a different viewpoint on this. That's unhealthy of THEM to do.\n\nIf they claim words shouldn't matter so much to you, then they should simply be able to drop their OWN obsession (with the importance of words). I see all this as you simply using these words, to acknowledge there was once another parent (your Dad). \n\nAnd I don't see why it suggests you are 'less' of a family, or 'less' bonded, by using 'step' and 'half'.

I don't see why it would. Kids generally look to the older people and adults in their life to see how to react to things, so it seems more like if the parents make a big deal about it, the half siblings will mind.

That leaving step behind is the way to be truly healthy after a loss, that embracing Jim as my new dad is better for me than always having him be my stepdad or mom's husband. We don't agree on that point.\n\nSomeone else suggested seeing if they would be okay with like honorary titles/nicknames that are not what they are asking for. That's something I'm going to try but I expect it will be rejected.", "You sound extremely mature in your writing. I think Jim's feelings are hurt that you keep dismissing him as 'dad' as he probably feels like one to you (which is also a good thing, he could've been really horrible to you).

Your cumulative response to most of the replies reflects this. That your memory of your father is like a time capsule in a fragile bottle. One slip, and that bottle breaks. There goes that ideal place in your memory of him.\n\nIf you would care to share, how did your father pass? Your initial post said it was traumatic and directly in front of you and your mother. This leads me to believe it was abrupt, unexpected, and maybe violent.", "And i think you are wrong for viewing this as an ego massage.

But can't he be more or different than simply your mother's husband and step-dad? You should be adamant about not wanting to call him dad, but you should go for calling him something that makes him special to you. Something that no one else is to you. You have known him for long, so there must be something between you two that keeps you connected. He tried to be your father for 8 years, and still is. That goes to show that you are someone special to him too. Why not try to work on how you're special to each other?", "He fell and hit his head. Seemed fine. Then he had a seizure right in front of us and died before help could come. It was easily the most traumatic and horrible thing that I ever saw.\n\nJust to add more details.\nWe were there when he fell. It didn't seem like a big thing at the time. Then a few days later we were all together and dad was playing with me, mom was watching us and cheering and he started to twitch and then fell to the ground convulsing and there was blood and drool and it's a memory forever etched into my mind.", "This. Every response is with her dad in mind. To honor him, not to forget him. That's not acceptance.\n\nAnd i think the \"step sibling issue\" doesn't reflect the full extent of this behavior.

Regardless of my efforts, he couldn't be saved. I know that fact verifiably, but it doesn't keep my subconscious mind from dwelling on it and second guessing if I could have done better or differently.\n\nThose heated and abrupt traumas burn themselves into our psyche. They leave a stain on all the good memories we have of someone. Invariably, those good memories always lead back to that really bad one.

You address them the way you're comfortable with, don't bend for their comfort because they're not doing the same for you.

So I apologise for my previous reply and did not mean any guilt. \n\nBut when it comes to therapy, it seems your mum and her husband are trying to use it to change your mind when the way therapy should be working for a family is to see from everyones side and work together that way - so I still believe that each side is still stuck on what they want rather make any compromise. Maybe bring up to them that you'd like a compromise, not to change anyones minds, just to settle it where everyone is happy. \n\nIf your mum and step dad still are upset by this, then you've shown you're willing to try but they aren't. :)", ">so be mindful that there\u2019s a time and a place for step/half and a time it\u2019s just better all round to have a single family.\n\nThis is false. \nThere is rarely, if ever a time when this truth isn't ok to share.

OP has, however, clarified she doesn't call them 'half-siblings' all the time. She refers to them as that, when explaining her family structure to other people. \n\nShe has explained she doesn't go up to the half-siblings, and say things like 'hello, half-sibling'. Now, THAT would be 'making a point' and being 'resentful'. You're also going off your own 'feelings' and assumptions about what people mean by the terms - not evidence of what they actually do. \n\nLanguage is used in many different ways, with different connotations, for different people. It's unfair to abnormalise/pathologise this girl for her own understanding and connotations of language - that plenty of other people in our society, use in a similar way. I've known many happy and unified stepfamilies that use these terms, because they aren't afraid of living in harmony with BOTH family identities (the previous family structure, and the current one). \n\nYou say it's 'exclusionary', not to acknowledge half-siblings/stepparents as purely 'siblings' and 'parents'. But why is it 'setting her apart' from the stepfamily, by not using their preferred terms- but it's somehow just fine to demand she use terms that set her apart from previous family structure/her father? \nThat's hypocritical. \n\n'Half' and 'step' are terms that acknowledge BOTH relationships (with a previous parent, AND the new family members). It doesn't exclude Jim and the half-siblings from acknowledgement as family. But dropping the 'step' and 'half' ONLY acknowledges the new family. There's no indication if you call Jim 'Dad' (and the half-siblings 'siblings'), that anyone other than Jim and her Mom have ever been in a parental role towards her. THAT is more exclusionary to me.  \n\nThis girl should NOT be abnormalised because she feels like she belongs to BOTH family structures (her current one, and her previous one). 'Step' and 'half' are technically correct terms for the relationships she is describing - and culturally acceptable to many (without being seen as 'exclusionary').

Similarly, my late stepfather was always \"my stepfather,\" and calling him that doesn't change how much I miss him every day.\n\nIt seems like your parents have bought into the idea that \"half\" and \"step\" mean \"less than,\" when really, they're just explanations of how things work.\n\nIf they'd been normal about things, I bet you eventually would have just started calling your half-siblings \"my sister\" and \"my brothers\" sometimes, because there are times when it really doesn't matter, so whatever.

I usually add the modifiers when talking about them the first time or when relevant to a story, \"I'm (me) and I have 4 brothers and two sister, two half, one whole, 3 step. Both parents re-married, mom had 2 more, stepmom came with three.\" \nNone of my siblings give a single, solitary fuck about being half or step, but we also don't force the modifiers into every statement which probably makes the difference. Idk if the OP runs around telling stories like \n\"so last night my half sister was trying to put her hair into a braid and I told my half sister that if she didn't put the hair tie on tight it'd fall off and my half sister was like 'i know how to do it's and then my half sister had her braid fall out because my half sister didn't listen to me...\"\nInstead of\n\"so last night my little sister was trying to put her hair into a braid and I told SistersName that if she didn't put the hair tie on tight it'd fall off and she was like 'i know how to do it\" and then sister had her braid fall out because she didn't listen to me...\"\nIt's the kind of thing that gets mentioned here or there, if the OP isn't being exceptionally overt and grinding it into every sentence they've ever spoken about it, I'd hardly consider it being \"not cool to little kids\".", "I can\u2019t believe this is getting downvoted. I absolutely understand the step parent thing I don\u2019t call my step mom \u201cstep mom\u201d or \u201cmom I just refer to her by her first name, her and my dad did not raise me so I find it weird to refer to her as such. \n\nBut the half sibling thing\u2026 I get referring to them as your half siblings when talking about them to someone who doesn\u2019t know them or if you were not raised with them. But the fact that OP mentioned that her mom wants her to drop the half siblings thing makes it seem like OP is constantly doing that around the house.\n\nEmphasizing the half part seems to be an attempt at distancing herself from them. I\u2019m not a psychologist or anything I just get that feeling from experience. I only call 1 out of my 4  half siblings my big brother because we have a bond. I don\u2019t really know my other siblings that well so I distance myself from them by referring to them as my half siblings", "You might be on to something.   I'm curious to look at 80s and 90s TV handling divorce and blended families?  I wonder how series like Full House and other \"happy to blend\" families, influenced people?", "a good compromise would be calling them brother and sister when you're referring to them as a singular person to acknowledge you love them, but as a whole call them your half siblings so that your own feelings aren't invalidated. but then again how you choose to refer to anyone is your own decision, don't compromise simply because someone else doesn't want to risk rocking the boat.", "Yes, this. And it\u2019s also interesting that even though all of this happened at such a young age and it\u2019s been many years since, they still feel that separation so strongly. OP is NTA but I do think therapy would be helpful for them to work out their trauma.", "The way they put it makes it sound like they are doing that. It's super weird that it would be a topic of conversation on the regular. \nMy half-brother A and my Half sister C. Instead of just saying brother or sister. I explain they are my half siblings to someone new for context... maybe every few years. Otherwise, it's unnecessary details and just uncomfortable, like you just described. \nI don't know how this person is saying it, but if it comes up enough that they are going to family therapy over it and their mother is worried about their mental health... I would say it is something to observe. Obviously, the step dad thing puts Mom's opinion into question here... \nHowever, if they are being extra with the kids, then the trip to the therapist makes sense. I don't know that we have enough info, which is why I said they should consider it. It's never bad to consider the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of others to make an informed choice. \nI have seen teens do exactly as you described because they didn't ever consider anyone's feelings but their own. Hell, I have seen adults do this. Then feel awful that they were so busy launching a war over one thing at one person they didn't consider all the people that got caught in the fire. I wasn't making a judgment, but I do want them to consider if they are doing it to such an extent that it is problematic.", "Right? There is so much pain here, and the OP clearly needs help. She is tying her memories of her late father to these kids' basic existence. That can't be good for her or them.\nIf every time she would normally say \"sister/brother,\" she is inserting the half... that isn't good.\nShe does need more mental and emotional support. Grief is a devastating part of life, but it is part of life. There are ways to honor her father, and not distance herself from her siblings. She can have photos of her father,  wear something special of his, celebrate his life on special occasions, journal about memories... anything but tying his death to these kids' lives."]}
