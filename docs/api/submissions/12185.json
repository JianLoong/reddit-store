For this we will call my mom's husband Jim.\n\nMy dad died in front of my mom and me when I was 6. It was traumatic as hell. My mom and I both went to therapy for three years as a result of what we saw. A year after dad died mom met Jim and fell in love with him. He helped mom heal in a way therapy wasn't able to. The way nobody else could. Jim and I got along pretty well. At times he tried a bit too hard to be a parent when he and my mom were still just dating and at times it felt like he wanted way more from me than I did from him. Before their wedding when I was 8 he and my mom told me they wanted to know if I would like to be adopted by Jim and to call him dad. I said no. Jim asked me if that was likely to change, I said no again. They did drop it and to their credit, never pushed after that.\n\nWhen I was 9 my mom had a baby boy and a year later she had a baby girl, followed by another baby boy a year later. I do love my half siblings. But I have always called them my half siblings. Mom asked me why I used half and I told her because we had different dad's. She told me that didn't make them half, that we still had the same mom, and even if we didn't, and they were Jim's kids with someone else, we were still family, still siblings now and using half or step for siblings was a little mean when you're so much older than them. It was a topic that came up time and time again.\n\nTwo months ago my mom and Jim decided the three of us needed to do family therapy together. It was there that not only was my using half brought up, but the fact I bounced between stepdad and mom's husband for Jim, and that I never called him dad or let others credit him as my dad. The therapist and I had talked solo and she talked to mom and Jim without me too. She helped guide me through some of what I had said to her. The questions were basically, why half, why is it bad for Jim to be known as dad, why can't that make me happy. So to sum up what I said. I told them that I love my half siblings, but we have different dad's and I don't ever want that to be forgotten, because I love and miss my dad and don't want him erased. That no matter how great Jim is, he is not my dad. That I'm glad mom has him since dad's gone. But it's important for me to let it be known I'm my dad's daughter, not Jim's and that it's a feeling that isn't changing for me, that I don't want it to change. That I'm still happy with how things are.\n\nMom and Jim were so unhappy with me for saying that. They said I was wasting everyone's time and their money if I was adamant about not working through my feelings on that and learning how to accept Jim can still be my dad and my siblings can be just siblings and it doesn't erase my dad. I said I didn't need that to happen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678700551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q59ca/aita_for_being_honest_about_how_i_feel_and_for/", "score": 244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I truly don't get why that is so important for your mother and stepdad. It is the way, it is, and nothing they can do can rewrite history. Does your mother really want that?

Therapy is for getting real feelings out, not \"getting with the program\". Your Mom and Jim should respect your feelings. They're butt hurt that your feelings won't change. I don't blame you. You have clear boundaries with respect for your Dad. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   \nIt sounds like they don\u2019t like it when they put in effort and don\u2019t get what they wanted.  \nIt\u2019s not YOUR fault THEY are wasting their time and resources chasing something you are perfectly entitled to feel.", "NTA. I commend you for you maturity in communicating your needs to your mom and step dad. Your reasons are thoughtful, deliberate, and not malicious. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s actually kind of sweet that your step-dad is hurt, because it means he cares about you and how you think of him. He and your mom just aren\u2019t doing a very good job at keeping their hurt to themselves so you aren\u2019t put in a position where you feel responsible for it.\n\nIf you believe he is good to you, maybe there is an honorary title you\u2019d be comfortable with, that you can propose as a compromise?\n\nMaybe there\u2019s an affectionate and special honorary you can propose for your half siblings as well?\n\nSomething to think about if you feel comfortable with the idea.", "NTA.

I hope you can find a way to love and remember your dad without making your siblings and Jim feel like less because they didn\u2019t know him and didn\u2019t see your bond with him. It\u2019s great that you appreciate him for everything he has done to help your mom move on. Yes I think your mom and Jim need to accept your feelings when it comes to calling him dad but you need to stop calling your siblings step or half. That is probably hurting your mother something fierce. She loves them the same way she loves you and that label you give them is hurtful to all. Even if you think that way you can keep it to yourself. Good luck!", "Your mother and her husband cannot buy you changing your mind.  Any therapist that tries to help them and not you is unethical.", "No assholes. \n\nI think it's unfair that you've been shunned for being honest and I totally understand not wanting to call your step dad your dad. My step dad is better than my real dad yet I still call him his name and he knows how much I appreciate him. I will however say I can understand from their point of view, this seems like something thats come up in conversation a lot and your adamant on your decision, they may feel like you don't want to be part of the family - I'm not saying this is true but I'm just trying to see from their side too. To them it must feel like you don't want to cooperate or want them to also feel okay and that whatever your decision is, is final.\n\nThe only thing I can say, and can see other people have mentioned is the half sibling talk - I think when it comes to this you're focusing a lot of how you feel about this situation, and due to your siblings being young as well they aren't going to have alot of understanding to why you want to call them half siblings. \n\nFrom my own experince its very hurtful to be called just a half sibling, even if thats the truth of it. I saw you reply to someone else saying you feel most comfortable calling them that, but also remember how they may feel about it too.\n\nof course everyone is different and maybe your siblings won't mind it, but as someone who has four sisters and has been called a \"half sibling\" a lot, it hurts a bit because it feels like you aren't a REAL sibling to them and in a way feels like a weapon.\n\nIt might be different in my case due to circumstances, but just keep it in mind for the future - its important to do whats best for you but you also have to take into consideration what other people feel too, and here I'm mostly concerned about your siblings.\n\nYour mum and step dad seem to be focusing on what they want more than focus on how to help everyone, but saying that it seems that you are also just focusing on what you want here too. No one is trying to work to make sure everyone is okay and focusing all on themselves.\n\nQuick after thought: No one really speaks to their siblings like \"Hi there sibling\" so I am beginning to think that you call them your half siblings to make some sort of statement, which I understand due to your trauma but much like other people have said you really need to do more extensive therapy.", "NTA.\n\nI may not understand your feelings on this, my stepdad was \"dad\" and my half-brothers were always just \"brothers\", but I can't say that you are being an AH by having those feelings. You aren't. And your mother and stepdad aren't AHs for their feelings on the matter, but the way they are dealing with it *does* make them AHs. \n\nNow, I don't feel that calling Jim \"dad\" and dropping the \"half\" toward your siblings would be erasing your father. I also think that it is possible to have more than one person you call dad, because being a dad is more than about blood. *However*, it would not be right of me to try to force you to agree with me on that - and this is why Jim and your mum are AHs.\n\nHow you feel is important and needs to be respected, even if they don't agree with it.", "NAH.\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way, and they learn to cope with that grief in their own way.\n\nYour mom seems to have found comfort and new happiness in Jim, and that's fine.\n\nYou seem to have reconciled with your dad's death up to a point - you want to make sure he isn't forgotten, and that's fine.\n\nWhat might be the real issue is that the way you and your mother are handling that residual grief may be butting against each other. Where you see the use of stepfather and half-siblings as just a statement of fact, you might accidentally be rubbing salt in your mom's wounds that Jim is not her first husband - and conversely, her trying to get you to stop giving these distinctions seems to be accidentally stomping on your desire to honor your dad.\n\nIf I could give a small piece of advice, I would recommend trying to shift the focus of your group therapy sessions to discover the emotional drives behind your respective desires and/or attempting to find a some mutual understanding that can help you both find a middle ground. (Jim might also benefit from some private sessions to cope with his feelings about the step/dad situation.)", "I feel like this isn't a topic for this subreddit. You can't ask if you are an AH or they are. Everyone's feelings in this situation are valid to some degree. \n\nIt is perfectly understandable that you want to keep your deceased father's memory alive. That the trauma of losing him is still there. I feel that you need to pursue further therapy on loss and grief, perhaps group therapy with others who have similar loss. \n\nIn regards to your parents. Your mother very much wants a cohesive family unit. The loss of your father hit her hard too, but she found the ability to move on with someone who obviously cares. \n\nJim has, from your own statement, made overtures to accept you as his child. That doesn't mean that he wants to erase your father from your memory. He just wants to forge forward with making the rest of your life happy and memorable. It probably hurts him that his efforts and feelings aren't being validated. But until you are willing to accept your father's passing (which you arent there yet) you won't be able to accept Jim's feelings.\n\nAs for your siblings, they are your siblings and calling them anything but is weaponizing your negative feelings towards your parents and possibly those kids. After all they are children too and have nothing to do with your trauma. But your actions towards them can leave lasting effects on your relationship with them for decades to come.", "Well. This is a mixed bag for me. NTA for not wanting to call Jim dad but the half brother's thing seems a bit AH. They are your brother and sister.\n\nYou really need therapy. You seem to have a lot of issues and some resentment towards Jim and your siblings. Also I think you didn't process the lost of your father.", "I am getting flamed for this one but i think you should comply a bit more\n\nJim has never wanted you to forget your dad, at all. He wants the torch your father held to be passed to him, as a guardian. He knows he isnt your biological father, but he is trying to fill your fathers shoes FOR YOU so that you wouldnt feel a void. An appropriate Analogy would be he is subbing for your dad, whos out of a football game for an injury. He isnt as good, but he gets the job basics done\n\nIf he didnt care for you,he wouldnt have tried this much. I am not saying do everything like hes your actual father from now, but i really believe you should at least try baby steps. Hes making an attempt, try reciprocating it for a bit once?\n\nThis is just my opinion, but if your thoughts on the situation are firm, then theres no changing that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not about them at all, really.", "I see absolutely nothing in the post, that suggests she is 'resentful'. You're simply assuming that, because you don't agree on her decision to use 'half'. But frankly, I find that attitude towards her patronising (i.e. your assumption that there must be something 'wrong' with her emotions in some way, because her opinion on this doesn't align with yours). \n\nYour comment that she 'really needs therapy', is also based on your disagreement with her choice of words (and the baseless assumptions you make, about the reasons behind her word choice). Therapy should NOT be abused as a way to 'problematise' somebody's beliefs/behaviour, etc., just because they take a different viewpoint to you (which, incidentally, Jim and her mother are also doing). \n\nThere isn't necessarily a 'right' or 'wrong' answer in these situations. But I do see her logic in using 'step' and 'half'. She simply wants to honour her Dad - and feels like the use of 'step' and 'half' helps with that. That's because referring to Jim as 'Dad' (and the siblings as just 'siblings'), may well give the impression there was no other Dad before Jim. \n\nAnd she doesn't want that. I don't see any automatic 'resentment' in that. People choose different ways to honour lost loved ones. And indeed - if words are so unimportant for denoting family relationships (to the point she should simply be comfortable dropping the 'half' and 'step'), then why does it matter so much to her Mom and Jim, that she drop those words?! \n\nThey are acting like she is denying the family relationships/family unity- when she isn't. Even referring to them as 'half' and 'step', reflects that they are a family. And why does the term 'half-sibling' have to imply any less love and bonding? It simply acknowledges there was another parent involved originally. So I say leave the kid alone. She simply wants to keep her father acknowledged in the family, and this is one of the ways she does it.", "I believe a more appropriate analogy would be Jim is coming in the game after the starting pitcher is out.

They are abusing the purpose of therapy, i.e. they are trying to problematise you, simply for having a different viewpoint on this. That's unhealthy of THEM to do.\n\nIf they claim words shouldn't matter so much to you, then they should simply be able to drop their OWN obsession (with the importance of words). I see all this as you simply using these words, to acknowledge there was once another parent (your Dad). \n\nAnd I don't see why it suggests you are 'less' of a family, or 'less' bonded, by using 'step' and 'half'.

She made an hill on this issue.\nIt seems to me that her mother and step father already found that this is not the only issue with her. They do seem like concerned parents who want to help.", "Your analogy is amazing, and i should have realized how their view on therapy was wrong", "I agree with you on your point, and that mom and step dad shouldn't push her so hard about it", "Reciprocate what they're conveying. What you feel is the most important, but you should ask them why they're so adamant about all this. Your step dad and mom sound like loving people, if they explain their views instead of asking for reforms, I'm sure you could reach a mutual understanding. \n\nLook at it from \nstepdads pov here- He might feel alienated\nMoms pov- Youre being cold\nBut that's because none of you have mutual understanding. Call me cocky, but i think this is an issue thatll get sorted out with a talk\n\nAs almost 16 myself, I would be pretty lost too in your shoes. Time heals all wounds, but scars do stay. I'm the kind to compromise though, so this can also be pretty useless to you", "I would hope they would understand. We can still be close and still have the distinction used. I love them. I play with them. I cheer them on for first words and steps. I am still loving toward them. My hope is they will grow up with an understanding of why I use it and know it doesn't change how much I love them.", "There's nothing that indicates that it's impacting their relationship with the half siblings. I don't see why it would. Kids generally look to the older people and adults in their life to see how to react to things, so it seems more like if the parents make a big deal about it, the half siblings will mind. It's up to the parents to not make them feel like there's a divide there. OP obviously cares about them, labels don't matter.", "I can try. Thanks for suggesting it. That's not something I would have really considered myself.", "I could also call my sister, half sister, but that wouldn't be true right? They are her half siblings so she calls them that", "You're not offending me at all. It's okay. I understand I'm only 16 and still have a lot of growing to do.", "Not everything is around that. Certain things will always be though, because it's what feels right to me. I will always be his daughter. He will always be my dad. I don't get to have him with me. So at least being known as his and getting to talk about him is something.", "Oh Lordy no. A good therapist would never put something so complicated in a tight knit box like that. Acceptance comes in many forms. OP can fully accept that her father is gone while continuing to think about him daily. That\u2019s a perfectly normal and healthy reaction to have.\n\nJim and the mom are attempting to overstep their position. They are in the wrong here and should have stopped the second they realized OP was content as it was. They are attempting to fix a problem via OP that only exists in their heads. It\u2019s not OPs responsibility to massage their egos.", "We have talked about it before. But they have this desire that I don't have. They feel like what they want is healthier than what I want. That leaving step behind is the way to be truly healthy after a loss, that embracing Jim as my new dad is better for me than always having him be my stepdad or mom's husband. We don't agree on that point.\n\nSomeone else suggested seeing if they would be okay with like honorary titles/nicknames that are not what they are asking for. That's something I'm going to try but I expect it will be rejected.", "You sound extremely mature in your writing. I think Jim's feelings are hurt that you keep dismissing him as 'dad' as he probably feels like one to you (which is also a good thing, he could've been really horrible to you). I hope that they both realise that you're honouring your father by not replacing the word, and that Jim realises he is important to you anyway", "I think what \"Additional Rush User\" is getting at here is that you might not even realize that you're still projecting an \"all about your father\" mentality.  Your cumulative response to most of the replies reflects this. That your memory of your father is like a time capsule in a fragile bottle. One slip, and that bottle breaks. There goes that ideal place in your memory of him.\n\nIf you would care to share, how did your father pass? Your initial post said it was traumatic and directly in front of you and your mother. This leads me to believe it was abrupt, unexpected, and maybe violent.", "And i think you are wrong for viewing this as an ego massage. I see this has an family attempt to help her and not the other way around. I'm also quite sure this is not the only issue with OP when relating to the \"new' family. \n\nFor me this \"screams\" unsolved issues. And i would bet that OP behavior extends to many other actions on her life. Maybe to many of them. And maybe not on a healthy way. Going into family therapy, over a death parent, for a ego massage seems to far fetched for me.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong", "They're not wrong about a step ahead, but their method is. They probably think that after all this, walking ahead without looking back is the best course of action, but they forget that the past is also a part of us. \n\nJim will never be your dad. But can't he be more or different than simply your mother's husband and step-dad? You should be adamant about not wanting to call him dad, but you should go for calling him something that makes him special to you. Something that no one else is to you. You have known him for long, so there must be something between you two that keeps you connected. He tried to be your father for 8 years, and still is. That goes to show that you are someone special to him too. Why not try to work on how you're special to each other?", "He fell and hit his head. Seemed fine. Then he had a seizure right in front of us and died before help could come. It was easily the most traumatic and horrible thing that I ever saw.\n\nJust to add more details.\nWe were there when he fell. It didn't seem like a big thing at the time. Then a few days later we were all together and dad was playing with me, mom was watching us and cheering and he started to twitch and then fell to the ground convulsing and there was blood and drool and it's a memory forever etched into my mind.", "This. Every response is with her dad in mind. To honor him, not to forget him. That's not acceptance.\n\nAnd i think the \"step sibling issue\" doesn't reflect the full extent of this behavior. I'm almost sure that this behavior is extended to many other actions on OP life. To the point that her mother and step dad had to join her in therapy.", "That tracks,  I can understand your trauma to some degree. I had a close friend/father figure/roommate stroke out on me a few years ago. I was a roome away when he collapsed. I was the first to administer chest compression in an attempt to stave off his inevitable death while the EMTs were en route. All while his 19 year old son is there having a meltdown.  Regardless of my efforts, he couldn't be saved. I know that fact verifiably, but it doesn't keep my subconscious mind from dwelling on it and second guessing if I could have done better or differently.\n\nThose heated and abrupt traumas burn themselves into our psyche. They leave a stain on all the good memories we have of someone. Invariably, those good memories always lead back to that really bad one. You are forever going to try to protect the (negligible) four years or less of memories you have of your father, as they are all you have. \n\nBut don't let those four years be a deterrent to you making good memories  in the next forty years with your mother and Jim. That time will come and go before you know it.  I don't think that you will want to be sitting there after Jim's gone and wondering if you could have had a better relationship with him. (also been here with two step-fathers whom have passed)", "NTA \n\nThey seem \u2026 tiring. Your mom got the help she needed through support from Jim. Why won\u2019t they accept that you don\u2019t want him as your father? Especially after witnessing something so traumatizing. \n\nId expect that from Jim, seems like a try hard. But, not from your mother. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this pushes you to hold some type of resentment towards them soon. You\u2019re NTA", "As I said on another similar post ask your parents in therapy if god forbid Jim dies whilst your younger siblings are still young and your mum marries again are they ok with Jim being erased? With Jim\u2019s replacement being called Dad. \n\nAnd when they tell you it\u2019s not going to happen point out it already did a happily married man with a young child died and he probably didn\u2019t expect it- didn\u2019t expect his wife to want to erase him in the future no matter how nice her new husband was. \n\nKeep stressing to them to confirm that the erasure of dead parents is ok and when they inevitably do one of two things - 1 - say yes exasperated, well then ask them to tell their kids that. That if mummy or daddy dies you are supposed to forget them. Make it a family rule. \n\nOr 2) when they keep saying no or it\u2019s different- ask your mother when did she stop loving her husband your dad, how could she live with herself over betraying him with this erasure  and that they are both hypocritical. \n\nBelieve me I know that both these options are extreme but honestly this kind of Bs deserves it. \n\nYou keep on loving your dad and being awesome", "So in the nonexistent event of your mom passing, and Jim remarried, would your mom want you to call his new wife \u201cmom\u201d?", "NTA.  They\u2019re the ones who chose therapy to fix what doesn\u2019t need to be fixed, so the wasted time and money is on them, not you.", "NTA. It sounds like you are working through your feelings. You're just not doing so with the goal of giving them everything that they want, which seems to be what they mean by you working through your feelings. \n\nYou're setting some boundaries for yourself, and they're not unreasonable ones. Your mother and stepfather need to respect this and drop it.", "NTA. They only want therapy to try to force you to act the way they want you to, not to work out your feelings.", "NTA", "NTA", " NTA. You explained your reasoning well. They need to honor you by letting you honor your dad.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, although I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your half-sibling is heavily favored by your step-father in the future. Best of luck!", "NTA. They didn\u2019t want therapy, they wanted a third party to tell you to fall in line. I would have a one on one talk with him. Let him know this sort of attitude will only push a wedge between you all. If he still can\u2019t accept that, I\u2019m sorry. It won\u2019t get better. I wish I could say different but start planning your move out when you are old enough", "NTA \n\nBasically they're saying that therapy is a waste of money if they don't get the outcome they want, which is super unhealthy", "NTA.  They aren't doing therapy to help you, they want it to change your perfectly valid opinion against your wishes.", "Therapy is to work though and understand.\nThey have failed to understand your feelings & needs.\nClearly, they felt therapy was to \"fix\" you and agree to their way and wants. That's not how therapy works.\n\nIn my opinion, you need to express your love for your half siblings & step dad. Tell them. Show them. They are stuck on semantics.", "That's what I don't want but the therapist did suggest it could happen, if pushed into calling Jim dad and dropping the half. She said people can comply when pushed hard enough but that will often be where resentment begins.\n\nAnd I don't want that. I want my mom to walk me down the aisle when I get married, I want her to give me a special mother-daughter dance. Because I'm her girl. And she's always been there. And she's the most important person in the world to me left.\n\nI just want to be equally my dad's girl.", "There's also the fact some new people could assume my dad was my half siblings dad. That Jim is stepfather to all of us. I'm sure that would be quickly corrected and would be super weird for my siblings. Yet that would be seen as okay. But it's only wrong when it's a stepparent. The thing is, I don't think calling Jim my dad would make me feel any closer to him. If anything, as the therapist pointed out during our solo talk, it could make me resent them when I don't right now.", "I don't think she would. I don't think Jim would want my half siblings to call another man dad either.", "She does, but she doesn't like it being used for people is what she says.", "They're wrong, plain and simple. They're putting what they want above what you need. Jim isn't your father, your half siblings are indeed just that. Why is it so important to them to force this issue? Why do your feelings matter less just because its not what they want? Why is Jim claiming a title so important to your mother? \n\nAsk them these questions in therapy, and indeed any others you can think of. Either they'll realise something useful, or you will.", "I do believe you mom's trauma is at least part of the reason for insisting you drop the half and step labels. Those remind her of that trauma. Moving on for her apparently means making your current family THE family. And she obviously doesn't get that moving on from the loss you both suffered looks different for an adult and a child, for a daughter and a wife. It is perfectly ok for her to have a new husband, but this doesn't necessitate you to have a new father. Rules for parental and romantic relationship are different on so many levels and one of those differences is that you're not commiting bigamy by having father and step-father.\n\nYour mother and step-father may not consciously try to erease your father, but I bet they'd prefer you let him fade into the background of the family life. Put him into the back of the closet as other artifacts from your earlier life you've outgrew. It might be re-traumatizing to your mom for you to \"remind\" her of his loss whenever you use step and half labels\u2014but that is for her to deal with during therapy.\n\nYour family sure needs therapy. But not to make you cave to their POV but for them to accept yours and the fact you're not harming anybody by calling your family by factually correct terms. They are the ones applying values to them, not you.", "Maybe mom and Jim need some therapy alone. Everything you have said is valid, and simply true. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nAlso for your mom. I'd add that she may need to look at what she's asking of you, and work on that. Hopefully your therapist will see this too.", "Them ignoring/burying the truth isn't healthy at all when they're essentially trying to force you to change your mindset. Others have probably asked questions about how you introduce/address your extended family but instead of then finding a way to have a healthy conversation, they're trying to force their narrative onto you; there's nothing wrong with calling people their correct titles as they relate to you & anyone that says otherwise is trying to alter the way you view your reality/past.", "Don't listen to others OP, you do you. You address them the way you're comfortable with, don't bend for their comfort because they're not doing the same for you. If you bend now, this is going to lead to demands of walking you down the aisle as your father when you probably would have other plans for that. Give an inch, they'll take a mile. So stand your ground. NTA", "I've been thinking a bit more about this post and I've come to the conclusion that it's definitely up to you what you call your family. My concern was just how my own family dynamic is and how hurtful being called a half sibling is for me, but I do get it used as a weapon towards me and that I'm not \"real\" related to them.\n\nI think my own emotions got caught into this response and I realise now that you aren't doing it with that intent. So I apologise for my previous reply and did not mean any guilt. \n\nBut when it comes to therapy, it seems your mum and her husband are trying to use it to change your mind when the way therapy should be working for a family is to see from everyones side and work together that way - so I still believe that each side is still stuck on what they want rather make any compromise. Maybe bring up to them that you'd like a compromise, not to change anyones minds, just to settle it where everyone is happy. \n\nIf your mum and step dad still are upset by this, then you've shown you're willing to try but they aren't. :)", ">so be mindful that there\u2019s a time and a place for step/half and a time it\u2019s just better all round to have a single family.\n\nThis is false. \nThere is rarely, if ever a time when this truth isn't ok to share. I have half siblings and step siblings. Kids can handle knowing their half sister/step sister had a different father.\n\nIt's not ok to try and erase that - ever. \n\nOp, NTA. \n\ni'd tell them they're risking having a relationship with me at all in the future once I'm an adult.", "It's pretty clear you've never been in a similar situation. You're telling OP to suppress her identity as if that will have zero impact. I've been NC with my adoptive parents for decades. They aren't bad people. But analogous stuff doomed our relationship.", "That's one that has some ick factor for me. But I will think of something if everyone is okay with it.", "It's the parents who have made this the hill they will die on. If they just relaxed and accepted OP for who she is then everyone can get along just fine.", "I think we'll just have to end up strongly disageeing. OP has, however, clarified she doesn't call them 'half-siblings' all the time. She refers to them as that, when explaining her family structure to other people. \n\nShe has explained she doesn't go up to the half-siblings, and say things like 'hello, half-sibling'. Now, THAT would be 'making a point' and being 'resentful'. You're also going off your own 'feelings' and assumptions about what people mean by the terms - not evidence of what they actually do. \n\nLanguage is used in many different ways, with different connotations, for different people. It's unfair to abnormalise/pathologise this girl for her own understanding and connations of language - that plenty of other people in our society, use in a similar way. I've known many happy and unified stepfamilies that use these terms, because they aren't afraid of living in harmony with BOTH family identities (the previous family structure, and the current one). \n\nYou say it's 'exclusionary', not to acknowledge half-siblings/stepparents as purely 'siblings' and 'parents'. But why is it 'setting her apart' from the stepfamily, by not using their preferred terms- but it's somehow just fine to demand she use terms that set her apart from previous family structure/her father? \nThat's hypocritical. \n\n'Half' and 'step' are terms that acknowledge BOTH relationships (with a previous parent, AND the new family members). It doesn't exclude Jim and the half-siblings from acknowledgement as family. But dropping the 'step' and 'half' ONLY acknowledges the new family. There's no indication if you call Jim 'Dad' (and the half-siblings 'siblings'), that anyone other than Jim and her Mom have ever been in a parental role towards her. THAT is more exclusionary to me.  \n\nThis girl should NOT be abnormalised because she feels like she belongs to BOTH family structures (her current one, and her previous one). 'Step' and 'half' are technically correct terms for the relationships she is describing - and culturally acceptable to many (without being seen as 'exclusionary'). Trying to force her to use language to their own preference, is only trying to force her Mom's/Jim's prioritisation (of the new stepfamily) on her.", "I'm a grown woman who has one full sister, plus stepsiblings down both sides of my parents' remarriages. Sometimes I call them my siblings, sometimes my stepsiblings, depending on the context and what makes things make sense. It doesn't change how much I love them (which is a lot). Similarly, my late stepfather was always \"my stepfather,\" and calling him that doesn't change how much I miss him every day.\n\nIt seems like your parents have bought into the idea that \"half\" and \"step\" mean \"less than,\" when really, they're just explanations of how things work.\n\nIf they'd been normal about things, I bet you eventually would have just started calling your half-siblings \"my sister\" and \"my brothers\" sometimes, because there are times when it really doesn't matter, so whatever. But they've made it Such A Big Deal now that I bet that distinction will always matter to you. It's their fault, so if they don't like it, they have no one to blame but themselves.", "I respectfully disagree with you. You are holding them at arms length with a label.

My father was a widower with 2 kids (my brother and oldest sister) and my mom was a widow with 3 kids (my next three sisters). So, five kids at the wedding, and then they had my sister and then me.

We are very close.", "It does scream unresolved issues. For mum and Jim.  They went into this therapy to 'fix' OP and have her assimilate into their family unit for their comfort and I suspect to minimize the questions from the younger kids. \n\nUltimately, they need to accept OPs decisions here as they are poised to drive the wedge between OP and the rest of the family. Their residual anger will taint OPs last few years at home and make her less likely to come back.
