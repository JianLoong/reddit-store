For this we will call my mom's husband Jim.\n\nMy dad died in front of my mom and me when I was 6. It was traumatic as hell. My mom and I both went to therapy for three years as a result of what we saw. A year after dad died mom met Jim and fell in love with him. He helped mom heal in a way therapy wasn't able to. The way nobody else could. Jim and I got along pretty well. At times he tried a bit too hard to be a parent when he and my mom were still just dating and at times it felt like he wanted way more from me than I did from him. Before their wedding when I was 8 he and my mom told me they wanted to know if I would like to be adopted by Jim and to call him dad. I said no. Jim asked me if that was likely to change, I said no again. They did drop it and to their credit, never pushed after that.\n\nWhen I was 9 my mom had a baby boy and a year later she had a baby girl, followed by another baby boy a year later. I do love my half siblings. But I have always called them my half siblings. Mom asked me why I used half and I told her because we had different dad's. She told me that didn't make them half, that we still had the same mom, and even if we didn't, and they were Jim's kids with someone else, we were still family, still siblings now and using half or step for siblings was a little mean when you're so much older than them. It was a topic that came up time and time again.\n\nTwo months ago my mom and Jim decided the three of us needed to do family therapy together. It was there that not only was my using half brought up, but the fact I bounced between stepdad and mom's husband for Jim, and that I never called him dad or let others credit him as my dad. The therapist and I had talked solo and she talked to mom and Jim without me too. She helped guide me through some of what I had said to her. The questions were basically, why half, why is it bad for Jim to be known as dad, why can't that make me happy. So to sum up what I said. I told them that I love my half siblings, but we have different dad's and I don't ever want that to be forgotten, because I love and miss my dad and don't want him erased. That no matter how great Jim is, he is not my dad. That I'm glad mom has him since dad's gone. But it's important for me to let it be known I'm my dad's daughter, not Jim's and that it's a feeling that isn't changing for me, that I don't want it to change. That I'm still happy with how things are.\n\nMom and Jim were so unhappy with me for saying that. They said I was wasting everyone's time and their money if I was adamant about not working through my feelings on that and learning how to accept Jim can still be my dad and my siblings can be just siblings and it doesn't erase my dad. I said I didn't need that to happen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678700551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q59ca/aita_for_being_honest_about_how_i_feel_and_for/", "score": 2057, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I truly don't get why that is so important for your mother and stepdad. It is the way, it is, and nothing they can do can rewrite history. Does your mother really want that?

Therapy is for getting real feelings out, not \"getting with the program\". Your Mom and Jim should respect your feelings. They're butt hurt that your feelings won't change. I don't blame you. You have clear boundaries with respect for your Dad. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   \nIt sounds like they don\u2019t like it when they put in effort and don\u2019t get what they wanted.  \nIt\u2019s not YOUR fault THEY are wasting their time and resources chasing something you are perfectly entitled to feel.", "NTA. I commend you for you maturity in communicating your needs to your mom and step dad. Your reasons are thoughtful, deliberate, and not malicious. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s actually kind of sweet that your step-dad is hurt, because it means he cares about you and how you think of him. He and your mom just aren\u2019t doing a very good job at keeping their hurt to themselves so you aren\u2019t put in a position where you feel responsible for it.\n\nIf you believe he is good to you, maybe there is an honorary title you\u2019d be comfortable with, that you can propose as a compromise?\n\nMaybe there\u2019s an affectionate and special honorary you can propose for your half siblings as well?\n\nSomething to think about if you feel comfortable with the idea.", "NTA.

I hope you can find a way to love and remember your dad without making your siblings and Jim feel like less because they didn\u2019t know him and didn\u2019t see your bond with him. It\u2019s great that you appreciate him for everything he has done to help your mom move on. Yes I think your mom and Jim need to accept your feelings when it comes to calling him dad but you need to stop calling your siblings step or half. That is probably hurting your mother something fierce. She loves them the same way she loves you and that label you give them is hurtful to all. Even if you think that way you can keep it to yourself. Good luck!", "Your mother and her husband cannot buy you changing your mind.  Any therapist that tries to help them and not you is unethical.", "No assholes. \n\nI think it's unfair that you've been shunned for being honest and I totally understand not wanting to call your step dad your dad. My step dad is better than my real dad yet I still call him his name and he knows how much I appreciate him. I will however say I can understand from their point of view, this seems like something thats come up in conversation a lot and your adamant on your decision, they may feel like you don't want to be part of the family - I'm not saying this is true but I'm just trying to see from their side too. To them it must feel like you don't want to cooperate or want them to also feel okay and that whatever your decision is, is final.\n\nThe only thing I can say, and can see other people have mentioned is the half sibling talk - I think when it comes to this you're focusing a lot of how you feel about this situation, and due to your siblings being young as well they aren't going to have alot of understanding to why you want to call them half siblings. \n\nFrom my own experince its very hurtful to be called just a half sibling, even if thats the truth of it. I saw you reply to someone else saying you feel most comfortable calling them that, but also remember how they may feel about it too.\n\nof course everyone is different and maybe your siblings won't mind it, but as someone who has four sisters and has been called a \"half sibling\" a lot, it hurts a bit because it feels like you aren't a REAL sibling to them and in a way feels like a weapon.\n\nIt might be different in my case due to circumstances, but just keep it in mind for the future - its important to do whats best for you but you also have to take into consideration what other people feel too, and here I'm mostly concerned about your siblings.\n\nYour mum and step dad seem to be focusing on what they want more than focus on how to help everyone, but saying that it seems that you are also just focusing on what you want here too. No one is trying to work to make sure everyone is okay and focusing all on themselves.\n\nQuick after thought: No one really speaks to their siblings like \"Hi there sibling\" so I am beginning to think that you call them your half siblings to make some sort of statement, which I understand due to your trauma but much like other people have said you really need to do more extensive therapy.", "NTA.\n\nI may not understand your feelings on this, my stepdad was \"dad\" and my half-brothers were always just \"brothers\", but I can't say that you are being an AH by having those feelings. You aren't. And your mother and stepdad aren't AHs for their feelings on the matter, but the way they are dealing with it *does* make them AHs. \n\nNow, I don't feel that calling Jim \"dad\" and dropping the \"half\" toward your siblings would be erasing your father. I also think that it is possible to have more than one person you call dad, because being a dad is more than about blood. *However*, it would not be right of me to try to force you to agree with me on that - and this is why Jim and your mum are AHs.\n\nHow you feel is important and needs to be respected, even if they don't agree with it.", "NAH.\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way, and they learn to cope with that grief in their own way.\n\nYour mom seems to have found comfort and new happiness in Jim, and that's fine.\n\nYou seem to have reconciled with your dad's death up to a point - you want to make sure he isn't forgotten, and that's fine.\n\nWhat might be the real issue is that the way you and your mother are handling that residual grief may be butting against each other. Where you see the use of stepfather and half-siblings as just a statement of fact, you might accidentally be rubbing salt in your mom's wounds that Jim is not her first husband - and conversely, her trying to get you to stop giving these distinctions seems to be accidentally stomping on your desire to honor your dad.\n\nIf I could give a small piece of advice, I would recommend trying to shift the focus of your group therapy sessions to discover the emotional drives behind your respective desires and/or attempting to find a some mutual understanding that can help you both find a middle ground. (Jim might also benefit from some private sessions to cope with his feelings about the step/dad situation.)", "I feel like this isn't a topic for this subreddit. You can't ask if you are an AH or they are. Everyone's feelings in this situation are valid to some degree. \n\nIt is perfectly understandable that you want to keep your deceased father's memory alive. That the trauma of losing him is still there. I feel that you need to pursue further therapy on loss and grief, perhaps group therapy with others who have similar loss. \n\nIn regards to your parents. Your mother very much wants a cohesive family unit. The loss of your father hit her hard too, but she found the ability to move on with someone who obviously cares. \n\nJim has, from your own statement, made overtures to accept you as his child. That doesn't mean that he wants to erase your father from your memory. He just wants to forge forward with making the rest of your life happy and memorable. It probably hurts him that his efforts and feelings aren't being validated. But until you are willing to accept your father's passing (which you arent there yet) you won't be able to accept Jim's feelings.\n\nAs for your siblings, they are your siblings and calling them anything but is weaponizing your negative feelings towards your parents and possibly those kids. After all they are children too and have nothing to do with your trauma. But your actions towards them can leave lasting effects on your relationship with them for decades to come.", "Well. This is a mixed bag for me. NTA for not wanting to call Jim dad but the half brother's thing seems a bit AH. They are your brother and sister.\n\nYou really need therapy. You seem to have a lot of issues and some resentment towards Jim and your siblings. Also I think you didn't process the lost of your father.", "I am getting flamed for this one but i think you should comply a bit more\n\nJim has never wanted you to forget your dad, at all. He wants the torch your father held to be passed to him, as a guardian. He knows he isnt your biological father, but he is trying to fill your fathers shoes FOR YOU so that you wouldnt feel a void. An appropriate Analogy would be he is subbing for your dad, whos out of a football game for an injury. He isnt as good, but he gets the job basics done\n\nIf he didnt care for you,he wouldnt have tried this much. I am not saying do everything like hes your actual father from now, but i really believe you should at least try baby steps. Hes making an attempt, try reciprocating it for a bit once?\n\nThis is just my opinion, but if your thoughts on the situation are firm, then theres no changing that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not about them at all, really.", "I see absolutely nothing in the post, that suggests she is 'resentful'. You're simply assuming that, because you don't agree on her decision to use 'half'. But frankly, I find that attitude towards her patronising (i.e. your assumption that there must be something 'wrong' with her emotions in some way, because her opinion on this doesn't align with yours). \n\nYour comment that she 'really needs therapy', is also based on your disagreement with her choice of words (and the baseless assumptions you make, about the reasons behind her word choice). Therapy should NOT be abused as a way to 'problematise' somebody's beliefs/behaviour, etc., just because they take a different viewpoint to you (which, incidentally, Jim and her mother are also doing). \n\nThere isn't necessarily a 'right' or 'wrong' answer in these situations. But I do see her logic in using 'step' and 'half'. She simply wants to honour her Dad - and feels like the use of 'step' and 'half' helps with that. That's because referring to Jim as 'Dad' (and the siblings as just 'siblings'), may well give the impression there was no other Dad before Jim. \n\nAnd she doesn't want that. I don't see any automatic 'resentment' in that. People choose different ways to honour lost loved ones. And indeed - if words are so unimportant for denoting family relationships (to the point she should simply be comfortable dropping the 'half' and 'step'), then why does it matter so much to her Mom and Jim, that she drop those words?! \n\nThey are acting like she is denying the family relationships/family unity- when she isn't. Even referring to them as 'half' and 'step', reflects that they are a family. And why does the term 'half-sibling' have to imply any less love and bonding? It simply acknowledges there was another parent involved originally. So I say leave the kid alone. She simply wants to keep her father acknowledged in the family, and this is one of the ways she does it.", "I believe a more appropriate analogy would be Jim is coming in the game after the starting pitcher is out.

They are abusing the purpose of therapy, i.e. they are trying to problematise you, simply for having a different viewpoint on this. That's unhealthy of THEM to do.\n\nIf they claim words shouldn't matter so much to you, then they should simply be able to drop their OWN obsession (with the importance of words). I see all this as you simply using these words, to acknowledge there was once another parent (your Dad). \n\nAnd I don't see why it suggests you are 'less' of a family, or 'less' bonded, by using 'step' and 'half'.

I don't see why it would. Kids generally look to the older people and adults in their life to see how to react to things, so it seems more like if the parents make a big deal about it, the half siblings will mind.

That leaving step behind is the way to be truly healthy after a loss, that embracing Jim as my new dad is better for me than always having him be my stepdad or mom's husband. We don't agree on that point.\n\nSomeone else suggested seeing if they would be okay with like honorary titles/nicknames that are not what they are asking for. That's something I'm going to try but I expect it will be rejected.", "You sound extremely mature in your writing. I think Jim's feelings are hurt that you keep dismissing him as 'dad' as he probably feels like one to you (which is also a good thing, he could've been really horrible to you).

Your cumulative response to most of the replies reflects this. That your memory of your father is like a time capsule in a fragile bottle. One slip, and that bottle breaks. There goes that ideal place in your memory of him.\n\nIf you would care to share, how did your father pass? Your initial post said it was traumatic and directly in front of you and your mother. This leads me to believe it was abrupt, unexpected, and maybe violent.", "And i think you are wrong for viewing this as an ego massage.

But can't he be more or different than simply your mother's husband and step-dad? You should be adamant about not wanting to call him dad, but you should go for calling him something that makes him special to you. Something that no one else is to you. You have known him for long, so there must be something between you two that keeps you connected. He tried to be your father for 8 years, and still is. That goes to show that you are someone special to him too. Why not try to work on how you're special to each other?", "He fell and hit his head. Seemed fine. Then he had a seizure right in front of us and died before help could come. It was easily the most traumatic and horrible thing that I ever saw.\n\nJust to add more details.\nWe were there when he fell. It didn't seem like a big thing at the time. Then a few days later we were all together and dad was playing with me, mom was watching us and cheering and he started to twitch and then fell to the ground convulsing and there was blood and drool and it's a memory forever etched into my mind.", "This. Every response is with her dad in mind. To honor him, not to forget him. That's not acceptance.\n\nAnd i think the \"step sibling issue\" doesn't reflect the full extent of this behavior.

Regardless of my efforts, he couldn't be saved. I know that fact verifiably, but it doesn't keep my subconscious mind from dwelling on it and second guessing if I could have done better or differently.\n\nThose heated and abrupt traumas burn themselves into our psyche. They leave a stain on all the good memories we have of someone. Invariably, those good memories always lead back to that really bad one.

You address them the way you're comfortable with, don't bend for their comfort because they're not doing the same for you.

So I apologise for my previous reply and did not mean any guilt. \n\nBut when it comes to therapy, it seems your mum and her husband are trying to use it to change your mind when the way therapy should be working for a family is to see from everyones side and work together that way - so I still believe that each side is still stuck on what they want rather make any compromise. Maybe bring up to them that you'd like a compromise, not to change anyones minds, just to settle it where everyone is happy. \n\nIf your mum and step dad still are upset by this, then you've shown you're willing to try but they aren't. :)", ">so be mindful that there\u2019s a time and a place for step/half and a time it\u2019s just better all round to have a single family.\n\nThis is false. \nThere is rarely, if ever a time when this truth isn't ok to share.

OP has, however, clarified she doesn't call them 'half-siblings' all the time. She refers to them as that, when explaining her family structure to other people. \n\nShe has explained she doesn't go up to the half-siblings, and say things like 'hello, half-sibling'. Now, THAT would be 'making a point' and being 'resentful'. You're also going off your own 'feelings' and assumptions about what people mean by the terms - not evidence of what they actually do. \n\nLanguage is used in many different ways, with different connotations, for different people. It's unfair to abnormalise/pathologise this girl for her own understanding and connotations of language - that plenty of other people in our society, use in a similar way. I've known many happy and unified stepfamilies that use these terms, because they aren't afraid of living in harmony with BOTH family identities (the previous family structure, and the current one). \n\nYou say it's 'exclusionary', not to acknowledge half-siblings/stepparents as purely 'siblings' and 'parents'. But why is it 'setting her apart' from the stepfamily, by not using their preferred terms- but it's somehow just fine to demand she use terms that set her apart from previous family structure/her father? \nThat's hypocritical. \n\n'Half' and 'step' are terms that acknowledge BOTH relationships (with a previous parent, AND the new family members). It doesn't exclude Jim and the half-siblings from acknowledgement as family. But dropping the 'step' and 'half' ONLY acknowledges the new family. There's no indication if you call Jim 'Dad' (and the half-siblings 'siblings'), that anyone other than Jim and her Mom have ever been in a parental role towards her. THAT is more exclusionary to me.  \n\nThis girl should NOT be abnormalised because she feels like she belongs to BOTH family structures (her current one, and her previous one). 'Step' and 'half' are technically correct terms for the relationships she is describing - and culturally acceptable to many (without being seen as 'exclusionary').

Similarly, my late stepfather was always \"my stepfather,\" and calling him that doesn't change how much I miss him every day.\n\nIt seems like your parents have bought into the idea that \"half\" and \"step\" mean \"less than,\" when really, they're just explanations of how things work.\n\nIf they'd been normal about things, I bet you eventually would have just started calling your half-siblings \"my sister\" and \"my brothers\" sometimes, because there are times when it really doesn't matter, so whatever.

I would say it is something to observe. Obviously, the step dad thing puts Mom's opinion into question here... \nHowever, if they are being extra with the kids, then the trip to the therapist makes sense. I don't know that we have enough info, which is why I said they should consider it. It's never bad to consider the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of others to make an informed choice. \nI have seen teens do exactly as you described because they didn't ever consider anyone's feelings but their own. Hell, I have seen adults do this. Then feel awful that they were so busy launching a war over one thing at one person they didn't consider all the people that got caught in the fire.

It could be that correcting people about who her dad is feels uncomfortable and she wants to handle it with the label of half, so people don\u2019t make assumptions.

He's incredible for my mom, has stuck around despite all of us (mom, me, and my sibling) having mental illness and other health struggles, provides for us, is calm and comforting and just wonderful. I'm 31 now so he has been in my life longer than my dad was at this point. However, he has never once presumed to call himself my dad. He never asked to adopt us. He has never even asked to be called anything other than his first name. My mom has also never expected this from us. We talk about Dad all the time, almost daily! My dad is still a part of our family and still a part of our lives and my stepdad respects that and understands that. I find this especially remarkable because he and my mom never had kids of their own. He raised my sibling and I, through our miserable teenaged years and beyond, and never once expected to replace our dad. \n\nEveryone grieves differently. Maybe your mom doesn't like to talk about your dad, that's ok. But expecting you to change how you grieve (grieving is a lifelong process) and how you hold your dad in your heart is unacceptable. Your mom and stepdad clearly have an idea of a \"perfect happy family\" in their head....but that's their problem, not yours.

Do they get all up in arms if someone talks about a first causin vs a second cousin? Drives me batty.", "NTA. Your doing just fine. Stick to your course and you be you. Everyone else here is wrong period", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe how frequently this needs to be said. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s decision but yours to call Jim your father.", "Jim nor your mom are entitled to force you to call him 'dad'. He isn't your dad and you know it, that means you love your real dad and wish to keep that title for him. Too bad for Jim, but he can't force you. Therapy won't change that fact although you personally do need it for handling the situation you went trough with your actual dad passing away. It's clearly still affecting you and it's better to get help for that. You don't want to end up putting that up on your future partner or future kids (if you end up with this) It won't be fair towards them.", "You need loads of therapy to understand that you can love your mom\u2019s husband as a dad without forgetting your bio dad. And your siblings are your siblings. Full stop. Differentiating them like that is likely hurtful to them. You\u2019ve obviously not dealt with the trauma surrounding your father\u2019s death. You need to deal with that.", "in your bad luck you are so lucky. you had two dad who loved you. Your mother and Jim don't want to erase your dad they just want some recollection and love too. I think the most blatant thing is that you call your brothers half brothers. you need to grow up and appreciate all the good you have. family is the most important thing and you don't seem to care about them. for me, yes YTA.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t Jim use the therapy to get over his bad feelings about the situation?", "NTA. I'm happy that you're a very mature young lady. My parents (even though I love them dearly) suffered a lot of horrible things when they young. Hence, they grew up emotionally immature and unstable.\n\nThat is a truth that most if us will face. We will grow up realising who and what our parents or other adults are. We will realise that we're actually more mature than them, not necessarily better but only some aspects (emotional and mental usually).\n\nYou've done your part. I'm glad that you're not angry with them. Hopefully they will realise how wonderful of a person you have become.", "OP. As long as your relationship with Jim is respectful on both sides you should not be pressured to behave differently. Presumably your father was a good man and would still be in your life had he not died prematurely. You do not owe it to Jim or your mother to consider him your father. You should also not feel as though your father would be upset with you for acknowledging another important man in your life. My father died when I was young So I definitely understand your desire to preserve his role and make sure he is not forgotten. However as an adult with a child of my own I would not want my daughter to feel as though it was her job to distance herself from others in order to preserve that bond. your father would want you to be happy. Your father would want you to go to the father daughter dance, to be walked down the aisle, to experience all of the things joyfully that unfortunately he missed.", "NTAH", "NTA,  I will *never* understand people who think they can force a child into calling a step dad/step mom their dad/mom. It\u2019s something the child has to decide. Some do, some don\u2019t, but your feelings that calling Jim your dad would make you feel like everyone was trying to erase your dad is EXTREMELY VALID. You feel that your one and only dad has passed away, that how you feel, you don\u2019t feel like Jim is an additional or new dad and that shouldn\u2019t be shamed. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re pushing this. The calling your siblings your half siblings may be worth a conversation if it hurts your half siblings\u2019 feelings (doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily change what you call them, but a conversation may help them understand since they didn\u2019t lose a dad), but this calling Jim dad business should be completely dropped. You are your own person and that is a title YOU get to grant on your own terms.", "NTA. What I hear you saying is your mom and step dad care more about labels than how you actually feel or behave towards anyone? I have a stepdad and always refer to him as my stepdad. To me it was never less important than my dad. He took care of me when my dad wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not an othering title. I don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t take pride in it.", "NTA\nBut you need your own therapist. One that does NOT talk to your parents. \nOne that fits YOUR needs. \n\nIt's ok to not think if him as dad. Just as Jim. \nAnd they must accept this. \n\nYour siblings. UGHHHH\nGiven that they are younger, might be on you to just go with the flow. Once they are older, they WILL understand that you have different dads. \nThat's almost the new normal in most places. \n\nAt some point in your future, once your brain is done growing and developing (25ish), you will have a whole new view and insight into all of this. \n\nI wish your parents were smart enough to back the fuck off. Pushing you won't help. Will just push you away. \nIf and when you go away to college ..... distance should HELP!!", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.  \n\nI\u2019m equally sorry your mom and step-dad seem too selfish to understand that what you need is understanding and kindness.  \n\nI hope you can find an adult (maybe this therapist?) who can help you continue to heal.", "NTA  I feel the same way about my blended family. My Mom died when I was in my teens, and my Dad remarried a few years later. My stepmother didn't like it if my sibs and I ever spoke about our mother. To this day (I'm in my 50's) I can't bring myself to drop the \"step\" because it feels like erasing my Mom. \nAlso, your mother and stepfather were disingenuous in going to \"family\" therapy with you when their goal was to have you change.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent at a young age has to be one of the most difficult things to experience. Although that didn\u2019t happen to me, my brother was killed when his kids were young, and I have seen my nieces and nephew navigate an ever changing emotional landscape. The most important thing to know is that there is no wrong way to feel about your mom, her husband, and their children. You have experienced a trauma that is wrapped up in your family life, and how that family changes over time means your emotions will also fluctuate. If your therapist is supportive and helpful,, stay with her. If not, find one who is. Take care of yourself.", "NTA\n\nGlad he is a decent dude but I am sorry you are going thru this. I don't understand parents who try to erase a parent that has died. So long as you are nice to all of them what does it really matter what you call/think of them.", "Honey NTA at all, especially for your parents acting like you are wasting money by not agreeing with them.\n\nOP, as a possible third way through this situation, could using an alternative or nickname for Jim work? Like Pops or something? I worry they will put increasing pressure on you to drop the \"step\" at the risk of alienating you, so maybe this will give an option your stepfather will accept.", "NTA. I always call my stepdad by his name, and the two of us are good with that.\n\nYour mom and stepdad need to accept that your feelings may differ than theirs.", "NTA, your mother and Jim are AH's, with how he's acting Jim doesn't deserve the title of stepfather let alone \"dad\".", "Ask your therapist to explain to them that you have worked through your feelings; its just that your mom and Jim want you to change how you feel to suit them.   Look Jim in the eye and tell him that if something happens to him, your mother will erase his memory in a minute.", "NTA. \nYour explanation of what you told them in therapy is moving, levelheaded, and very fair. You don't (seem to) show any resentment to your mother, stepdad, or sibs, but want your father to be present in your life as someone very important to you. A very good answer. I don't understand why they're upset.\n\nThey are wasting their money if they suggested therapy in order to reach a specific result of their choosing, ie that you drop the 'step' and call Jim dad. \n\nQuestion: What was your therapists's response to your summary?", "NTA  LOL - you're \"wasting everyone's time and their money\" if you don't change and do what they want.  Apparently them understanding you and respecting your feelings is not an option.  \n\nHonestly, when I read the end of the second to last paragraph where you put into words what you felt, I felt so proud of you and convinced they would understand (ha).  If you were my child in that blended family situation I would have hugged you and told you I was so proud of you and understood and would not pressure you to pretend your father didn't exist.  I don't know why adults fail to be able to do this.   I'm sorry they are too immature and focused on what they want to listen to you and hear how great you are.   Just two more years and you are free to move on with your adult life.  Hang in there.", "It's why like 60% of blended families fail. They are more concerned with appearances than making sure everyone is comfortable.", "Dude. Nobody in their 30s is expected to call their parents new spouse dad", "OP has one dad, as she clearly stated. There is no slight in using the term half-sibling. It's not a pejorative. OP explained her feelings on this very maturely. I don't see where she is being unappreciative or says she doesn't care about her family at all.", "A lot of people in the comments who have never been in a blended have a lot to say about blended family dynamics that they know nothing about.", "Heathier for them, not for you.\n\nNTA and I'm sorry you're being pressured like this.", "Their way is just the simplest one for *them*.\nTherapy is a waste only if they intend to use it to bend you to their wishes, on the contrary it would be incredibly useful if they use it (the way it is intended to be) to come to terms with your feelings. \nBasically they are assholes.", "They are ridiculous and wrong. You have a right to your feelings. Your feelings are eminently reasonable. I'm sorry they are not willing to see that.", "Yup, they took you to therapy to convince you to comply. That isn\u2019t how therapy works, and hopefully the therapist can explain that to them.", "As someone who is adopted and lost my (adopted not bio) mom when I was 11, biology has nothing to do with it. I have a step mom and step siblings. They will never be my mom or my siblings because they just won\u2019t be. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with biology, but it has everything to do with the feeling of trying to erase the memory of the parent you lost. I don\u2019t get along amazingly with my dad or my stepmom, but those are for other reasons and don\u2019t really matter. Even if I did, my mom can never be replaced. I\u2019m glad my dad found someone he\u2019s happy with, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she gets to take the place that my mom had and still has. I\u2019m glad my stepmom never forced us to call her mom because my sister and I absolutely would have never gone along with that. Losing a parent at a young age is something you don\u2019t understand unless you\u2019ve gone through it. Yes your mom lost her husband and my dad lost his wife, but that\u2019s so much different. You can get remarried. You can never replace a parent that you\u2019ve lost. I think it is so insane whenever someone tries to force that replacement\u2014even when they claim it isn\u2019t replacing them\u2014the wording matters so much. You don\u2019t need to call Jim your dad because he isn\u2019t your dad. You have a dad. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I hope your therapist stands up for you because it\u2019s ridiculous what your mom and Jim are trying to do. Good luck with everything and again I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "Does your family generally talk about deeper emotional issues?\n\nYour post reminds me of my own shallow parental relationships due to their emotional immaturity.", "Honestly I\u2019m glad to hear the therapist is realistic about this. I\u2019m very pro-therapy and therapists are humans after all so I was kinda looking for comments to see what the therapist said ha. Exactly, it can form resentment which will only distance you from your mom and Jim. They want it their way but I hope the therapist convinces them that their way is not the best way just because they want it to be", "in my point of view, we don't have half siblings, we have brothers and sisters, that for me clarifies what OP thinks and how little OP cares for the family that cares so much for Op. and I bet they never tried or wanted to eraise their late father like she talks about so much. it seems to me that OP has a lot of attention", "If I have to guess, it's because Mom & Jim are trying to create the image of a perfectly happy family, but OP refusing to address Jim as Dad & the Siblings as being full siblings is getting in the way of that.", "This is nothing but projection. OP should treat stepdad respectfully, but she does not owe him any affection. OP is comfortable with the half-siblings label. It is not a pejorative term, and it does not mean that she is isolating herself.", "They are her half-siblings. She is comfortable with referring to them as her half-siblings, and there's nothing wrong with that.", "Again, are you a part of a blended family? Yes or no.", "Projection? I don't get it.  I didn't say she owed him affection; I said I didn't detect any in her writing and asked how she felt about her step father.  \n\n\nAnd sure, she is comfortable with it but it seem very hostile to me so again, is that what she really wants her family to experience.", "My mother and siblings lost their mother at a young age. After some years, Dad remarried and they had several children. All of the children considered each other brothers and sisters and new wife was called Mom.  The deceased birth mom was never forgotten, never erased. \nIt was a beautiful thing to see.", "It was waiting their money because OP wasn't making any effort to work through her feelings. Working through her feelings means to get a deeper understanding, not necessarily to change her mind. She didn't even try.", "Yes, I have a sister that have another father and she is my sisther I don\u2019t see half in nothing. this is what really upset me", "OP having very basic boundaries is not hostility. The only ones being hostile are OP's mom and stepdad.", "And? OP has decided this type of dynamic is not going to work for her.", "What is there to work through? OP demonstrates very clearly that she understands why she feels the way she feels.", "He was a college friend. Uncle Jesse was their dead mom\u2019s brother.", "Hostility toward her siblings (half).  \n\nThey are her family and she is deliberately separating herself from them.  That could be \"basic boundaries\" or could be a teenager who lost her father and (in her mind) her mother to a new parent and 3 news kids who is doing irreparable harm to her relationships with them.  She may regret that some day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for OP's mom and stepdad, I am not defending them.
