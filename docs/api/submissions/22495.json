Person asked to move in with me and I said: don't bring flowers into the home. They constantly brought flowers in. They're in a church that considers flowers sacred. They'd get in with the flowers hidden in a bag and put them in the bedroom so I wouldn't know. Every time I'd find petals around the house and discover the flowers I'd remind them of my allergies, politely at first, but it didn't matter what I said or how many times I said, if it was face to face, texting, screaming, nothing helped. 3 months later I was constantly sick, got a heart check-up thinking it was covid sequelae, got a sleep study done that found the nighttime blood pressure issues were from apnea, then 4 months in, they discovered my nose was completely blocked bc the inner structures grew from the constant inflammation. 5 months into moving together, I had to get surgery to cut off the nasal turbinates. This was October, and I had done exams in February that showed normal turbinates, so it was definitely their fault. 2 weeks later we got into another fight where they told me \"I never brought flowers here, you're making this up to victimize yourself and get power over me.\" Now I have asthma, 2 different kinds of inhalers, they've moved back with their mother, and we don't speak anymore.", "ESH. She should have moved the flowers when asked and you shouldn\u2019t have taken out your anger at your boyfriend on the flowers.\n\nYou guys both acted immaturely.

Remember they were a gift from her boyfriend so even if she didn't particularly like them you quite plainly binned a gift that held sentimental value without warning her you would do so, a disproportional action that has the added affect of insulting her boyfriend also (who seems to have done nothing wrong whatsoever as far as we know).\n\nYou should have just taken the flowers into her room or leave them outside the door or something less extreme than just binning them altogether - so you are also the AH.", "NTA. You were considerate she wasn\u2019t.", "NTA after that many days the flowers are probably very close to being dead anyhow. And she had been asked to move them and agreed to.

However, once you've been made ill and have trouble breathing and sleeping over this, then I guess we'll be sorta even. Until then, there's a debt, but it's not from me to you, you owe me for making me sick and then doing nothing about it for days after being told.", "NTA, AVA had been warned more than enough times.

Sorted.", "Why not just put them at the foot of her door with a note saying they were bothering your allergies?\n\nSeems like an extreme reaction.  They weren't yours to throw away.  If they were bothering you, you should have used your words to explain just how much they were bothering you.\n\nYou might need to buy a bouquet of faux flowers and an I'm sorry I was an AH card. \n\nThis is less about the fact that you have allergies and more about the fact that you threw away her property and a gift from her bf.", "YTA.

You didn\u2019t remove the allergen you just harmed your flatmate\u2019s belongings.", "Because she got into one with her boyfriend? She was plenty nice, ask politely, gave DAYS for the flatmate to move them.", "Well it was only one", "OP threw them away inside so the allergen was not removed from the flat - meaning the only thing accomplished by throwing them away was damaging the flatmate\u2019s stuff.", "This is so funny to me", "This is such a sweet comment, I love it.\n\nMy husband and I moved into our house two years ago after living in a flat for years, and even now sometimes I walk past our stairs and get a giddy little thrill that these are OUR stairs.", "Not common in purpose-built blocks, not uncommon to have a \u2018front porch\u2019 type area in houses have have been converted to flats, ime. (Obviously only one flat would have an actual front porch but the others often have a little hallway/landing outside the front door that could serve the same purpose here.)", "Yep. Just inside the door, going in/looking in as little as possible.", "Her door was locked.", "That proof which also makes it hard for me to breathe, have a headache and constantly blow my nose and feel miserable.", "I think it depends what type of bin she put them in.  \nIf it was an open bin then yeah I agree, but there are household bins that have a tight lid on them which would stop the pollen getting out.", "They\u2019re still in the open in the house. And what if they have to go by the door? Having them out when your roommate has allergies to them is inexcusable when you could have just taken them to your room.", "Is THAT why the milk we bought here in Utah went bad before the expiration date when we\u2019ve never had that happen before? I learned something! Thanks.", "You have no clue what you are talking about. Stop talking out your ass", "They might be European being taught British English and more likely to have balconies.", "ESH", "NTA but you could have just put them in front of her door or something or at least send a message...assuming you don't have to walk past it. It gets the message across that they need to remember to take it into their room. If they put it back on the kitchen counter after that I would send them a message that I was binning it as I had told them enough times and even left it in a place that they would remember to do it, in the case they legitimately forgot. At the end of the day you're nta tho because you have allergies and you gave her enough heads up.", "You asked her to move on, she agreed and didn\u2019t.\n\nIt was affecting your health.\n\nShe still didn\u2019t move them and left all the plates in the sink.\n\nShe is selfish and not sympathetic to her roommate and their discomfort she caused her/you. \n\nI understand your frustration. She didn\u2019t pay for them, so she is not out any money, they are in the bin because of her behaviour. \n\nIf you have to - tell her, you had to go to the doctor with your allergies. She will back off on that reimbursement because she will be afraid that you will stick her with the doctor bill.", "YTA, i also live with flatmates and they sometimes \u201cannoy\u201d me but i would never throw out their belongings, especially something as special as flowers from their partners. i would put them somewhere else or wait for them to come home and tell them. you had no right to do that and to me you just sound petty. so entitled.", "What do you do when you go outside? Was it only these particular flowers that were giving you allergy problems?\nI don\u2019t believe these were an issue. I think you just wanted to throw your weight around and picked these as something to make a point about. YTA.", "OP, time to kick Ava out to the curb.", "Normal person \"sorry, I didn't know you were allergic. I'll move them now.\" It takes seconds to do. \n\nYou kind of were a little wrong for throwing them out but in a fully justified way. I'm going NTA because I think most people in your situation would have done the same.", "OP threw them away still inside the kitchen. This was 100% about jealousy and anger and zero about allergies.", "So the allergens were still about. So the allergy isn\u2019t that bad for you to not care about tossing them outside and you were just being petty? \n\nThe allergy is just an excuse you\u2019re using here to justify your shitty actions. Sure the roommate should have moved them when asked but your actions were hugely disproportionate. \n\nI have really bad allergies too to flowers and trees and fruit and all the fun things in life. They can\u2019t just be thrown out inside if there\u2019s an allergic reaction because the allergens are still airborne.", "I'm probably wrong", "As someone with severe allergies to a tonne of stuff including flowers trees etc. the bin wouldn\u2019t have solved it- it was just petty", "Op didn\u2019t remove the allergen at all and threw them in the bin inside the property. Allergy cannot have been that bad at all", "By front porch I assumed right outside of an apartment door would also be an option. I've had plenty of neighbours who had plants outside of their front door in appartment buildings. Leave it there with a note \"flowers are outside as I don't want to take medication as you know I'm allergic thanks!\" But OP also should have brought this up to her roommate before this was even an issue. if you have an allergy, your roommate should know, and you should get a guarantee before you move in with them that they care to avoid bringing what triggers your allergy into your shared home", "Fellow allergy sufferer and yes it\u2019s unreasonable to throw them away", "Ahh, I misunderstood that part, I thought it said she was in the apartment when she threw the flowers, mb", "Yeah I misunderstood a line in the story", "And my allergies are a sore throat and stuffy nose that doesn't stop me from doing anything it's just uncomfortable. I'm allergic to tree pollen.\n\nEveryone's allergies are different and if OP has allergies like mine then this was an over reaction, if OP has allergies like yours, then she should have tossed the flowers outside the apartment as to no longer have an allergen present in the apartment. \n\nIn both cases OP did not take appropriate action for the situation for both her health, and the roommates property"]}
