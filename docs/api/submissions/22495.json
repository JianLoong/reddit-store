Person asked to move in with me and I said: don't bring flowers into the home. They constantly brought flowers in. They're in a church that considers flowers sacred. They'd get in with the flowers hidden in a bag and put them in the bedroom so I wouldn't know. Every time I'd find petals around the house and discover the flowers I'd remind them of my allergies, politely at first, but it didn't matter what I said or how many times I said, if it was face to face, texting, screaming, nothing helped. 3 months later I was constantly sick, got a heart check-up thinking it was covid sequelae, got a sleep study done that found the nighttime blood pressure issues were from apnea, then 4 months in, they discovered my nose was completely blocked bc the inner structures grew from the constant inflammation. 5 months into moving together, I had to get surgery to cut off the nasal turbinates. This was October, and I had done exams in February that showed normal turbinates, so it was definitely their fault. 2 weeks later we got into another fight where they told me \"I never brought flowers here, you're making this up to victimize yourself and get power over me.\" Now I have asthma, 2 different kinds of inhalers, they've moved back with their mother, and we don't speak anymore.", "ESH. She should have moved the flowers when asked and you shouldn\u2019t have taken out your anger at your boyfriend on the flowers.\n\nYou guys both acted immaturely.

Remember they were a gift from her boyfriend so even if she didn't particularly like them you quite plainly binned a gift that held sentimental value without warning her you would do so, a disproportional action that has the added affect of insulting her boyfriend also (who seems to have done nothing wrong whatsoever as far as we know).\n\nYou should have just taken the flowers into her room or leave them outside the door or something less extreme than just binning them altogether - so you are also the AH.", "NTA. You were considerate she wasn\u2019t.", "NTA after that many days the flowers are probably very close to being dead anyhow. And she had been asked to move them and agreed to.

However, once you've been made ill and have trouble breathing and sleeping over this, then I guess we'll be sorta even. Until then, there's a debt, but it's not from me to you, you owe me for making me sick and then doing nothing about it for days after being told.", "NTA, AVA had been warned more than enough times.

Sorted.", "Why not just put them at the foot of her door with a note saying they were bothering your allergies?\n\nSeems like an extreme reaction.  They weren't yours to throw away.  If they were bothering you, you should have used your words to explain just how much they were bothering you.\n\nYou might need to buy a bouquet of faux flowers and an I'm sorry I was an AH card. \n\nThis is less about the fact that you have allergies and more about the fact that you threw away her property and a gift from her bf.", "YTA.

They are only flowers and I don't think binning them is so much of a big deal (given the circumstances) as they will die eventually anyway.", "Nta. She said she'd move them and was knowingly setting off your allergies. She lied, the consequences are losing flower privileges. Act like a child, get treated like one.", "NTA. You asked a few times for her to move them. You even texted her, which she never responded to. Plus, you threw them out on Sunday. They wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway.", "NTA flowers don\u2019t last very long anyways they had a day or 2 left in them if she wasn\u2019t changing the water daily and you asked her numerous times. I have severe allergies and until recently hated having flowers around for that reason -you asked multiple and she did nothing -that\u2019s on her", "NTA. You gave her multiple notices over the last few days. She heard and saw them all, yet still didn\u2019t do anything despite it affecting your health. She sounds really inconsiderate. Also, reimburse her for what exactly? She didn\u2019t buy them.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you were in a pissed off mood, so you acted rashly. You having hay fever and being mad at your boyfriend does not allow you to throw someone else's flowers away. In addition, you cannot force people to do things in your timeline. If you weren't so cranky and inflexible, maybe your boyfriend would send you flowers too, and you wouldn't have to hate on her.", "I have horrendous hayfever but flowers in the house rarely affect it after I\u2019ve had an antihistamine. ESH, you asked her to move them and she should have done but no need to chuck them away, put them in her room or outside the door or just outside for the time being if it\u2019s really bothering you that much (I don\u2019t think it is though, seems like you pick arguments).", "you explained to her that you suffer from allergies to flowers and asked her politely, multiple times over the course of several days, to move her bouquet to her own private space within the apartment, and still she didn't?\n\nNTA. yeet 'em. you go, girl.", "ESH  kinda TA - You shouldn't have thrown out the flowers because THEY DIDN'T BELONG TO YOU but she also should have moved them into her room.", "Info: did you try taking any allergy meds? Could you have put them on the floor just inside her room and closed the door?", "ESH. OP shouldn't throw away things that aren't theirs, especially when interacting with said item is likely to get allergens all over them in the first place.\n\nRoommate should have put them away in a timely manner.", "Ah no. She is true AH", "ESH she should have moved them sooner, but I\u2019d be angry if you threw them out. You could have put them outside her door, on the balcony, handed them to her when she returned.. lots of options beside tossing them.", "\"I feel justified as I was annoyed \"\n\nI'm afraid this explanation doesn't feel justified to me.", "You couldn\u2019t put them in her room or next to the door of her room? Come on, you just wanted to be a jerk because you were upset. \n\nESH", "Considering you mentioned in a comment you threw the flowers away inside, I\u2019m questioning how bad exactly your allergies are, and when the garbage was changed. ESH.", "ESH \n\nThey weren\u2019t yours to throw away but you did it anyways. You didn\u2019t ask her to throw them out but you went and did it anyways so I\u2019d agree you should reimburse her. \n\nThat being said, you did ask nicely more than once to please move them since they were causing your allergies to act up. You have the right to be able to breathe in your own house. Could you have put them on a balcony/in the garage/somewhere that wasn\u2019t the common area and then when she asked you could have given them back under the stipulation she immediately put them in her room so you could breathe?", "YTA to me it sounds like OP was jealous that Ava received flowers. OP had a rough weekend with her bf and seeing the flowers again made her more upset so she threw them away. OP should have moved the flowers to Ava's door rather than throw them away.", "YTA. You have mild hayfever. You\u2019ve just stated you\u2019re barely at home and if you are, how often are you actually in the kitchen? I don\u2019t see how they could\u2019ve bothered you that much.\n\nI am also a hayfever sufferer.", "YTA, you could've put the flowers somewhere else. Binning them seems over dramatic and mean to take out your anger on her.", "Nta", "How the hell long do people keep cut flowers? It was like 4 days, and they would have been done in a couple more anyway why would she want you to replace them?", "NTA - obviously", "Nta", "NTA. She had sufficient time to move them, was told the negative effect they were having on you, and did nothing.  If she doesn't move them, you will.  Good work. Sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA since you couldn\u2019t get into the room anyways", "NTA you gave her plenty of chances to take them to her room. You don\u2019t owe her a thing. She should apologize to you but you need to apologize to her as well because you could have still handled it better than you did. She\u2019s also rude for knowing how u react to them and not fixing it.", "NTA but i suggest disclosing rules like \u201cno flowers etc. in public places\u201d", "NTA.  This is literally a medical issue and it is not too much to ask.  (But I would have set the bouquet outside the flat.  And if that was unadvisable I would have just put another note out and put up with the flowers instead of causing drama with a flatmate.)", "NTA because you asked her to move them and she said she would days before you threw them out. But also, you said you felt justified because you were annoyed. Just because you are annoyed by something or someone doesn't make it ok to throw something out/be rude/etc. Be annoyed by something isn't justification for your actions.", "You gave a lot of opportunities to correct things. NTA", "NTA: She should have removed them before her run.", "NTA. Hayfever can be brutal and no one should have to suffer like that in their own home. You asked her repeatedly to move them and she made a conscious choice not to so this is on her.", "Unlikely the flowers would\u2019ve lasted much longer anyway. This is like being mad someone threw out your milk the day before it expired when you weren\u2019t going to use it anyway", "I think putting a clean garbage bag over them would have been the best option. If roommate wants to keep the flowers she can move them to her room and take the garbage bag off. But until then, the allergen is at least contained.", "> not yours to throw away, \n\nF that, cut flowers are impermanent, they were always destined for the bin. Knowingly causing your roommate to have an allergic reaction is so far beyond the realm of decency that anything short of burning her in effigy is reasonable.", "I wouldn't, OP asked and she refused...not to mention SHE wants reimbursed?!? Why should she make money off of OP...especially after ignoring her quite reasonable request.", "youre seriously suggesting they get her a gift?? after completely disregarding their allergies and not even caring enough about the flowers to actually move them? fuck that", "&#x200B;\n\nso holy of them", "Or left them outside by the front door.", "Op said they keep their rooms locked", "The boyfriend's okay!  He couldn't have been expected to know that his girlfriend lived with someone who had allergies AND that his girlfriend was incapable of moving flowers once she'd placed them.", "I was waiting for this comment cause this is what I believe happened too.", "Orrrrr finally noticing that the roommate read and ignored the message, after being asked multiple times, could\u2019ve been enough to throw them out", "She lives there \ud83d\ude10", "> If you can't handle flowers, you won't be able to handle hard things.  \n\nYou know allergies are a *health issue,* not a \"Hey liberal, toughen up!\" one, right?", "Perfect idea", "Right? If I were OP, I'd counteroffer by billing her for my allergy medication.", "I said the same thing about her being annoyed. I went with nta ONLY because she asked and roomie said they would move them and then days went by with no communication from the rookie. But the I feel justified because I was annoyed rubbed me the wrong way", "Thanks. New here.", "Nearly all the apartments where I live have porches/balconies", "There's an edit. They keep their rooms locked so OP couldn't have put the flowers in her roommate's bedroom.", "How is that a solution of they're still in the house?", "Yep. The porch/balcony comment got jumped on because people thought it was cute to pretend someone was showing their privilege by having a little outdoor space or shared outdoor space. In reality, in many small to medium sized cities, its more common to have something- a patch of space out by the parking lot of the building, or whatever. Something.", "what makes you think theyre american? saying flat and binning are usually british words/slang", "Where I live in Southern California it's not as common as you might think it would be given our many days of sunny weather.  I've lived in an apt with a balcony 1x and known someone with a balcony 1x and I'm 41.  I've never known anyone who had a porch who lived in an apt.  It's mostly people who are upper middle income who have apts or own condos who have balconies here or people who own houses. There's shared spaces in fancy condo buildings with how fees and super expensive apt buildings (rent is 5k+/mo) that have pricey monthly maintenance fees or homeowners. Rents are expensive here and a lot of places that might've had outdoor spaces in the past, owners took them out years ago to add more units.", "Same! I live in a Midwest town and have lived in other Midwest towns for the past 18ish years. Every apartment/\u201cflat\u201d either has a balcony/patio or a porch.", "are those letters supposed to mean anything to the non-usamericans?", "It's still HERs. As in, the roommate's. She had no right to throw her stuff away. \n\nI had a roommate once who went through the fridge and threw away some of my food because it \"was almost gone.\" Yeah, almost. As in, not gone. \n\nDo something else with it, hide it in a corner, put the flowers in a bag or box or something but they still don't belong to OP.", "I think I prefer it this way lmao", "Had to award you for that giggle lol", "No, no. They have to be in the servants quarters. A token of appreciation, much like an apple. After all she made it clear she will also be doing the dishes.", "Orangery", "Pfft would just buy a country house where the flat mate can live with her flowers and you take the townhouse."]}
