The flowers that were causing her reaction were still there Sunday, after OP asked multiple times.", "I was in this situation last year. Person asked to move in with me and I said: don't bring flowers into the home. They constantly brought flowers in. They're in a church that considers flowers sacred. They'd get in with the flowers hidden in a bag and put them in the bedroom so I wouldn't know. Every time I'd find petals around the house and discover the flowers I'd remind them of my allergies, politely at first, but it didn't matter what I said or how many times I said, if it was face to face, texting, screaming, nothing helped. 3 months later I was constantly sick, got a heart check-up thinking it was covid sequelae, got a sleep study done that found the nighttime blood pressure issues were from apnea, then 4 months in, they discovered my nose was completely blocked bc the inner structures grew from the constant inflammation. 5 months into moving together, I had to get surgery to cut off the nasal turbinates. This was October, and I had done exams in February that showed normal turbinates, so it was definitely their fault. 2 weeks later we got into another fight where they told me \"I never brought flowers here, you're making this up to victimize yourself and get power over me.\" Now I have asthma, 2 different kinds of inhalers, they've moved back with their mother, and we don't speak anymore.", "ESH. She should have moved the flowers when asked and you shouldn\u2019t have taken out your anger at your boyfriend on the flowers.\n\nYou guys both acted immaturely.

Remember they were a gift from her boyfriend so even if she didn't particularly like them you quite plainly binned a gift that held sentimental value without warning her you would do so, a disproportional action that has the added affect of insulting her boyfriend also (who seems to have done nothing wrong whatsoever as far as we know).\n\nYou should have just taken the flowers into her room or leave them outside the door or something less extreme than just binning them altogether - so you are also the AH.", "NTA. You were considerate she wasn\u2019t.", "NTA after that many days the flowers are probably very close to being dead anyhow. And she had been asked to move them and agreed to.

However, once you've been made ill and have trouble breathing and sleeping over this, then I guess we'll be sorta even. Until then, there's a debt, but it's not from me to you, you owe me for making me sick and then doing nothing about it for days after being told.", "NTA, AVA had been warned more than enough times.

Sorted.", "Why not just put them at the foot of her door with a note saying they were bothering your allergies?\n\nSeems like an extreme reaction.  They weren't yours to throw away.  If they were bothering you, you should have used your words to explain just how much they were bothering you.\n\nYou might need to buy a bouquet of faux flowers and an I'm sorry I was an AH card. \n\nThis is less about the fact that you have allergies and more about the fact that you threw away her property and a gift from her bf.", "YTA. You should have put the flowers in her room.
