The flowers were affecting your health.", "NTA she was literally causing an allergy attack and obviously didn't care enough about the flowers to move them in a reasonable timeframe.", "NTA\n\nShe had days to move them, obv she doesn't like them if she didn't want to put them somewhere safe.\n\nWhy wouldn't she want them in her bedroom?  She wants then where she won't have to look at them?\n\nI dont get it...\n\nI would've tossed them sooner or jammed them one by one under her door.", "Nope. NTA. You gave her days she did that to herself.", "NTA.  You asked she didn\u2019t do it in the trash they go. It\u2019s affecting your health.", "NTA. She had more than ample opportunity and reminders to remove your known allergen from shared space to her private space. You were well within your rights to remove them by whatever means after she had for so long failed to do so.", "ESH, you probably could have just put them in front of the door to her room.", "NTA. She's inconsiderate. You asked her more than once and she ignored you.", "Oh come on, you were mad you got into a fight with your boyfriend and the flowers being there was just an outlet because they were from her boyfriend. \n\nThat's why you didn't confront her and get her to move them because that wouldn't have caused problems for her, you wanted to start shit the moment you saw those flowers still there", "ESH lol reimbursed for flowers", "YTA\n\nYou weren't supposed to be back home for the weekend.\n\nSounds like you took your anger at your bf out on the flowers.", "YTA - you let emotions cloud your judgement.  You didn't need to throw them out.", "Honestly i would've just put the flowers in her room or next to her door and then spoke to her when she was next around.", "YTA you should outside and told her you were going to throw them away.\n\nYou took out your anger on the wrong person.", "ESH. She sucks and you sick", "Nta you asked her multiple times and she needs to learn what shared space means. Don\u2019t put something i am allergic to in the common area if you want to keep it.", "ESH. And you two just shouldn't be roommates. \n\nIf you can't handle flowers, you won't be able to handle hard things.", "YTA. This wasn't malicious on her part. You could have put them in her room yourself and let her know you moved them. It's more than likely that she forgot to move them and then wanted to enjoy them while you weren't supposed to be home.\n\nYou could've put them right next to her door. Throwing them out was a disproportionate response while you were in a bad mood from fighting with your boyfriend.", "NTA, hayfever sucks and she said she was going to move them on Friday. She didn't. \n\nThis being said, not yours to throw away, maybe you should've put them near her bedroom?\n\nTo keep the peace I'd suggest to get her some chocolate or something she likes that you aren't allergic to", "NTA you're literally allergic to the flowers. your roommate is an ass.", "Yes. Everyone in the story is an asshole", "YTA. You threw away property that didn't belong to you. I wonder how you would feel if the same was done to you.", "These flowers were causing her health problems, and she asked her roommate multiple times to move them. Asking her to put them in her room was a more than reasonable compromise, and roommate failed to do so despite having days and multiple reminders to do so.", "What does ESH mean?", "She has an allergy and the roommate had at least 2 or 3 days to move them after OP let them know about said allergy.", "Suck", "What? Flowers are \"hard things\" for people with allergies. I am very allergic to lilies and peonies, which I learned the hard way after enduring days of splitting headaches and wondering why I felt so bad.  Tossed out the flowers, opened the window and back door, headaches gone within an hour or so.", "Although ESH, I disagree with this sentiment. People can't control their allergies, it's not able being able to handle hard things. If your throat is going to close up or your eyes swell shut, that is a hard thing. Breathing is kind of important.", "Did ya miss the part where she said her allergies are *hayfever*?\n\nThat shit *sucks*. It puts me on my ass for days if I\u2019m not careful. Roommate should\u2019ve gotten rid of them or moved them out of common areas when she asked.", "Personally, I would have put them on the front porch or balcony.", "She was told what to do, she didn't for 3 days. Oh well", "Everyone Sucks Here", "Everyone sucks here", "Yes, allergies suck. But the solution is super easy. Just place the flowers near the roommate's door.", "Yeah, that's why the roommate also sucks. But instead of dealing with the flowers for so long, you can just place them outside of your roommate's door.", "She was able to pick them up and throw them away. What\u2019s a few more steps if they bother her that much?", "No, I didn't miss it. OP very easily could have moved them next to roommate's door so she'd bring them in. This was a really immature response, and hayfever doesn't make it okay to trash another adult's stuff.", "Not everyone has a front porch or balcony.", "Lol, that mentality definitely won't hold up in court (not that she'd be sued for flowers but if OP holds this world view for everything...she'll wind up in big trouble later).", "Thx", "Thx", "Which wouldn't make a difference unless they're behind a closed door.", "Why is it up to her to move the flowers out of common areas after asking quite a few times? Seriously?\n\nShe was asked multiple times to move the allergen from common areas and continuously disregarded it. At the very *least* this has to be an ESH. Since when is someone not an asshole for not removing something another person is allergic to from common areas after being asked *multiple times*?", "Do you have allergies? If the roommate wanted to still have the flowers which will decay anyhow soon, she could have had them in her room.", "It's more likely that the roommate forgot. OP wasn't even supposed to be home that weekend, so why did it matter that the flowers were there while she wasn't? It sucks that she has allergies, but OP was obviously capable of moving them.\n\nMaybe you haven't lived with roommates. When I did, I'd put things next to their door if they hadn't moved something after being asked. It always worked and it avoided fights. You can't dispose of what doesn't belong to you and be in the right.", "Forgot? After like 50 reminder? Okay bud", "She was asked on Thursday. The flowers that were causing her reaction were still there Sunday, after OP asked multiple times."]}
