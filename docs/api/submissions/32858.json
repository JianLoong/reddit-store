I\u2019m ok with being the AH if that\u2019s how it plays out, but I don\u2019t really see this as being as bad as my mom is making it out to be.\n\nMy (25F) dad died when I was 7. My mom remarried when I was 9 and had Jill (15F) and Janet (13F) with her new husband afterward. I have never liked her husband as he seemed dead set on replacing my dad and \u201cwinning me over\u201d in the most obvious and obnoxious ways possible. I tolerated him as much as I could stand, but I have always refused to allow him to be called my dad or to act as if he is in any way and when I moved out I told him not to contact me unless something was wrong with mom. I don\u2019t feel anything towards Jill and Janet and avoid them. I don\u2019t see them as siblings even if they are by blood. This upset my mom and her husband and I guess the kids, but there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. I can\u2019t feel what I don\u2019t feel and I won\u2019t fake it.\n\nSince I left home, I usually spend the holidays with my dad\u2019s parents, visit my mom without the others, and go to the reunion on her side where there are enough people that I don\u2019t have to deal with the others. This arrangement has been fine until last year when my mom asked me to stay with them. I declined. She asked me if it was because of her husband and the girls. I said yes, I feel like keeping distance there is best. She told me if I\u2019m not going to be part of her family to not come at all anymore. I said ok and still went to my grandparents and visited with members of the other side separately but didn\u2019t see her or go to the big get together. She lit my phone up like crazy trying to get me to change my mind. It was embarrassing.\n\nThis year she asked when I wanted to get together with her while I\u2019m there as if nothing happened. I told her I would respect her boundaries by not seeing her since I\u2019m not willing to play happy family with her husband and kids and she set that as a condition. She said that wasn\u2019t what she meant and she wants to see me. I told her she doesn\u2019t get to retract the ultimatum once laid out. If she wants to see me, she can travel to me without the others any time of year, but I\u2019m going to see my family for Christmas and if she doesn\u2019t want to be included in that she doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nAnyway, got a LONG screed from her husband essentially calling me an AH. Jill apparently stalks my social media and tried trolling me but I deleted her comments and blocked her without responding. I explained the situation to my grandparents on that side and they say that my mom\u2019s husband gave her an ultimatum about me so she\u2019s in a difficult place and doesn\u2019t know how to fix it. They suggested that they, my mom, and I have lunch to talk it out, but finding out that her husband was behind last year\u2019s issue makes me not want to deal with it even more.", "created_utc": 1702351083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gc96l/aita_for_forcing_my_mom_to_abide_by_the/", "score": 1033, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't get to act all flip-floppy because she didn't do a good job at blending her partner into the family and ensuring that he respects your decisions. He also doesn't have the right to message you calling you an AH when he started all of this in the first place. Don't listen to the other comments because again it is your life and you can have boundaries and decide who you want to associate with or not. Tell your grandparents that she isn't in a difficult place she just doesn't have the balls to put her foot down.

Now Mom has FAFO\u2019d and instead of just apologizing like an adult, and setting boundaries with her husband, she\u2019s wringing her hands and acting like the victim.

The kids are acting like kida because that's their nature at that age but, again,  if your mum and step-dad had worked things out in the beginning then this probably wouldn't be an issue right now.

I just lost mine 1.5 years ago and I haven\u2019t even begun to heal or even really confront it and NO ONE could ever replace him, ever. However, mine/your mother has every right to try and move on and be happy. Your mom got so lucky and found someone that she loved again and he sounds like he tried to be nice to you, perhaps he came on too string, but it\u2019s a tough spot as a step parent. And it\u2019s hard for you too! I understand not warming to him for awhile I get it. But it\u2019s been 16 years I believe and you have sisters and you are still refusing to at least try. This is your mother. And I know for sure it kills her daily that you\u2019re not around and her kids have never been all together as a family. I think she said what she did in hurt and anger and not because she actually wanted you to stop coming to visit. \n\nPerhaps you could just try to get to know them. I fear as you get older you may regret icing them out, but it will be too late to reconcile. I know it\u2019s hard and no one is replacing your dad, but sadly life has to continue and everyone deserves to find love and companionship is this rough world. \n\nAnyways, whatever you decide I wish you and your family the best.

Why didn't mom stop her husband from trying to replace someone who passed only two years prior? It sounds as if mom failed to blend the family, having the next kid when OP was 10 and the third when OP was 12.

As someone with a very similar story to yours, I can relate. You don't get a free ticket to asshole-ville, though. There is a difference, between not accepting e.g. your siblings as part of your family, as you're loyal to your late father, which I understand, versus you being actively hostile towards them. This quote especially caught my eye:\n\n>I can\u2019t feel what I don\u2019t feel and I won\u2019t fake it.\n\nBeing true to yourself and being an AH resistant to learning can be on the same scale, just different extremes. If you are being asked to pretend, as if you loved your siblings and your step-father the same way as you loved your dad, then yeah, refusal is staying \"true to yourself\". If you are merely asked to act like a decent human being, as in, not being actively hostile towards them and you refusing, then this is not \"being true to yourself\", but just being an AH and unwilling to improve your character. The truth is probably in the middle, but I do get the impression of the latter from the way you write about the situation, therefore I do view you as an AH in this story as well, albeit a small one. At 25 you are an adult and can be expected to exhibit at least the faintest restraint in social interactions, even given your trauma.\n\nYour mother either tried bluffing or was simply emotional in the situation, where she placed that ultimatum. It was already mentioned, she may be in a difficult spot. It still makes her an AH and you going by her rules is apparently not the result she was expecting.\n\n>I told her she doesn\u2019t get to retract the ultimatum once laid out.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhat's wrong with retracting these conditions, if she was to apologize for setting them in the first place? My suspicion is, she will not apologize, hence making the result she wants to achieve impossible, because you won't budge. But if she was to apologize, you not allowing her to retract these conditions would make the conflict persist on a technicality. Neither of you win, if that was the case.\n\nUltimately, you seem indifferent, to whether you lose out on that part of family, which is why some people here view you as cold. To my mind, this is because there was a lot of sh\\*t that happened between you and your mother, step-father and siblings over many years. Once again, I can relate. There is nothing wrong with closing that door forever, if you feel they are but toxic elements in your life. Only two things to be aware of: 1.
