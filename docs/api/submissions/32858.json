I\u2019m ok with being the AH if that\u2019s how it plays out, but I don\u2019t really see this as being as bad as my mom is making it out to be.\n\nMy (25F) dad died when I was 7. My mom remarried when I was 9 and had Jill (15F) and Janet (13F) with her new husband afterward. I have never liked her husband as he seemed dead set on replacing my dad and \u201cwinning me over\u201d in the most obvious and obnoxious ways possible. I tolerated him as much as I could stand, but I have always refused to allow him to be called my dad or to act as if he is in any way and when I moved out I told him not to contact me unless something was wrong with mom. I don\u2019t feel anything towards Jill and Janet and avoid them. I don\u2019t see them as siblings even if they are by blood. This upset my mom and her husband and I guess the kids, but there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. I can\u2019t feel what I don\u2019t feel and I won\u2019t fake it.\n\nSince I left home, I usually spend the holidays with my dad\u2019s parents, visit my mom without the others, and go to the reunion on her side where there are enough people that I don\u2019t have to deal with the others. This arrangement has been fine until last year when my mom asked me to stay with them. I declined. She asked me if it was because of her husband and the girls. I said yes, I feel like keeping distance there is best. She told me if I\u2019m not going to be part of her family to not come at all anymore. I said ok and still went to my grandparents and visited with members of the other side separately but didn\u2019t see her or go to the big get together. She lit my phone up like crazy trying to get me to change my mind. It was embarrassing.\n\nThis year she asked when I wanted to get together with her while I\u2019m there as if nothing happened. I told her I would respect her boundaries by not seeing her since I\u2019m not willing to play happy family with her husband and kids and she set that as a condition. She said that wasn\u2019t what she meant and she wants to see me. I told her she doesn\u2019t get to retract the ultimatum once laid out. If she wants to see me, she can travel to me without the others any time of year, but I\u2019m going to see my family for Christmas and if she doesn\u2019t want to be included in that she doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nAnyway, got a LONG screed from her husband essentially calling me an AH. Jill apparently stalks my social media and tried trolling me but I deleted her comments and blocked her without responding. I explained the situation to my grandparents on that side and they say that my mom\u2019s husband gave her an ultimatum about me so she\u2019s in a difficult place and doesn\u2019t know how to fix it. They suggested that they, my mom, and I have lunch to talk it out, but finding out that her husband was behind last year\u2019s issue makes me not want to deal with it even more.", "created_utc": 1702351083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gc96l/aita_for_forcing_my_mom_to_abide_by_the/", "score": 1976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't get to act all flip-floppy because she didn't do a good job at blending her partner into the family and ensuring that he respects your decisions. He also doesn't have the right to message you calling you an AH when he started all of this in the first place. Don't listen to the other comments because again it is your life and you can have boundaries and decide who you want to associate with or not. Tell your grandparents that she isn't in a difficult place she just doesn't have the balls to put her foot down.

Now Mom has FAFO\u2019d and instead of just apologizing like an adult, and setting boundaries with her husband, she\u2019s wringing her hands and acting like the victim.

The kids are acting like kida because that's their nature at that age but, again,  if your mum and step-dad had worked things out in the beginning then this probably wouldn't be an issue right now.

I just lost mine 1.5 years ago and I haven\u2019t even begun to heal or even really confront it and NO ONE could ever replace him, ever. However, mine/your mother has every right to try and move on and be happy. Your mom got so lucky and found someone that she loved again and he sounds like he tried to be nice to you, perhaps he came on too string, but it\u2019s a tough spot as a step parent. And it\u2019s hard for you too! I understand not warming to him for awhile I get it. But it\u2019s been 16 years I believe and you have sisters and you are still refusing to at least try. This is your mother. And I know for sure it kills her daily that you\u2019re not around and her kids have never been all together as a family. I think she said what she did in hurt and anger and not because she actually wanted you to stop coming to visit. \n\nPerhaps you could just try to get to know them. I fear as you get older you may regret icing them out, but it will be too late to reconcile. I know it\u2019s hard and no one is replacing your dad, but sadly life has to continue and everyone deserves to find love and companionship is this rough world. \n\nAnyways, whatever you decide I wish you and your family the best.

Why didn't mom stop her husband from trying to replace someone who passed only two years prior? It sounds as if mom failed to blend the family, having the next kid when OP was 10 and the third when OP was 12.

As someone with a very similar story to yours, I can relate. You don't get a free ticket to asshole-ville, though. There is a difference, between not accepting e.g. your siblings as part of your family, as you're loyal to your late father, which I understand, versus you being actively hostile towards them. This quote especially caught my eye:\n\n>I can\u2019t feel what I don\u2019t feel and I won\u2019t fake it.\n\nBeing true to yourself and being an AH resistant to learning can be on the same scale, just different extremes. If you are being asked to pretend, as if you loved your siblings and your step-father the same way as you loved your dad, then yeah, refusal is staying \"true to yourself\". If you are merely asked to act like a decent human being, as in, not being actively hostile towards them and you refusing, then this is not \"being true to yourself\", but just being an AH and unwilling to improve your character. The truth is probably in the middle, but I do get the impression of the latter from the way you write about the situation, therefore I do view you as an AH in this story as well, albeit a small one. At 25 you are an adult and can be expected to exhibit at least the faintest restraint in social interactions, even given your trauma.\n\nYour mother either tried bluffing or was simply emotional in the situation, where she placed that ultimatum. It was already mentioned, she may be in a difficult spot. It still makes her an AH and you going by her rules is apparently not the result she was expecting.\n\n>I told her she doesn\u2019t get to retract the ultimatum once laid out.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhat's wrong with retracting these conditions, if she was to apologize for setting them in the first place? My suspicion is, she will not apologize, hence making the result she wants to achieve impossible, because you won't budge. But if she was to apologize, you not allowing her to retract these conditions would make the conflict persist on a technicality. Neither of you win, if that was the case.\n\nUltimately, you seem indifferent, to whether you lose out on that part of family, which is why some people here view you as cold. To my mind, this is because there was a lot of sh\\*t that happened between you and your mother, step-father and siblings over many years. Once again, I can relate. There is nothing wrong with closing that door forever, if you feel they are but toxic elements in your life. Only two things to be aware of: 1.

The part where she says the mom just started acting like nothing happened is a bad attempt at the mom reconnecting but it's still an attempt and maybe the mom is just not good at apologies but OP has to see the sentiment since this is her mother.

I'm not saying you have to accept stepdad as any type of family member BUT that is your mom and she IS in a difficult situation having two young children. Also, why do you hate the stepsisters so much? They didn't choose to be born. Your mom made that decision for them. You act as if your fathers death and their fathers marriage to your mother is their fault. They did nothing. Maybe the teenager is trolling but she is hurt and she doesn't understand why you are choosing to hurt her mother. So she's defensive. \n\nI agree, you need boundaries with the husband. But I would encourage you to get counseling for yourself as well as with your mother so their is some type of relationship with the two of you. You never know, therapy may actually help her to see that ultimatums from your husband about excluding your blood child is not ok and she deserves better. \n\nStill going with NTA though.", "I think you need therapy OP.

If the husband was never your father, he has no reason to expect that relationship now.  I'm curious what ultimatum he gave your mum.  It's not like he can threaten to divorce his own wife (mother of his kids) if you don't start having a relationship.  What's his deal?  Is this a pride thing?

I just wanted to say it sounds to me like you really want your mom to reach out and actively choose you. I don\u2019t mean you want her to abandon her husband and other kids, but maybe for her to set a boundary with them and prioritise you as well. You can be a loving mom and daughter without being a whole family unit - if you both want that and are able to navigate the boundaries to make it work. \n\nFor those of us who have faced the crushing, ongoing sense of loss and unworthiness that comes with parental rejection, there is usually a piece of us that remains the little kid who feels sad and lonely and vulnerable. And who lashes out to protect herself. \n\nYou\u2019re an internet stranger and I know nothing about you, so please disregard if so. If it resonates at all then two things may help. The first is therapy for you to start to heal that wound. Narrative Therapy is an option that may help. The second is to consider family therapy (preferably by someone who specialises in family systems therapy and also blended family dynamics) for you and your mom to see if it is possible to find some sort of equilibrium in your relationship. If you go that road, individual therapy to help you through that process would be a good idea. \n\nI really hope whatever the situation you find some healing.

They shouldn\u2019t have married until op who was 10 was comfortable with this stranger. Yes it\u2019s what you sign up for with kids to put your needs last and theirs first. But they didn\u2019t do that. So here we are. They should have told the half sisters op doesn\u2019t hate them but she doesn\u2019t know them either. They should have explained this. The half sisters shouldn\u2019t have an expectations for op. That\u2019s on the parents as well. They are 15 and 13 not stupid. They will understand. Op doesn\u2019t see them as siblings btw so there\u2019s also that. Which is also the parents fault like how do you fail all of your children so bad. She\u2019s not taking anything out on them she just is indifferent towards them. And that\u2019s ok it happens all the time between siblings. But the indifference was caused by the parents pushing and Ultimatums on op does nothing to help the indifference. My point is this is all on ops mom and her husband fault.

The common denominator is the adult unilaterally deciding on the nature of their relationship with the child whose home they've entered - whether that means pushing them away \\*or\\* trying to pull them close.

She can say as much as she wants she refuses to accept him. But that is her stepdad. He is not in the wrong for trying to be a stepdad to her, when that's what he is.\n\nAre you sure you paid attention to OP's post? She aknowledges him as the stepdad and doesn't try to deny it. The problem is the stepdad trying to be a replacement to her \\*father\\*, which she wasn't ready for. And it's not just the trying that's the problem, but the persistence.\n\nMaybe at first she was still dealing with the sorrow of losing her real father and wasn't ready to have anyone try to replace them. Whether that is the case still or not is irrelevant, because the stepdad STILL pushed it when she clearly wasn't ready, and that can damage a relationship severely for a very long time. If you want to talk about kindness, then the kind thing would have been to give her space and let her come to terms with the situation on her own time, but according to OP that's not what happened. He chose to be overbearing when he should have been understanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why don't I care for them? There would have to be a reason why. I don't dislike people for simply existing.\n\nNot caring for someone and disliking someone are different things. If I see a stranger on the street, who I've never met before, I don't feel any way whatsoever towards them, because I don't know them. That also means I don't dislike them.\n\nAnd the reason isn't something the OP has to disclose to begin with. But the reason is... \\*again\\*... the stepdad being pushy and overbearing in \\*trying\\* to be a father. Trying once is not bad. Trying more times if the effort is welcomed is good. Trying more than once when the effort is NOT welcomed by the recipient is bad, because you are neglecting their feelings about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You mean they are nice to me and treat me well. They're a friendly person? I'm never going to be mad at that.\n\nNo. Simply being nice isn't nearly the same thing as treating someone like family. I'm not going to be mad if someone picks up and returns a thing that I dropped. I'm not gonna be mad if someone gives me a compliment, but that doesn't mean I'd put my life on the line for those people if that's all they did. However, I would put my life on the line for my own family, especially my sisters. I love them. When I need their help, they're there for me. Back when we were under the same roof and I \\*didn't\\* want their help, instead wanting space, they respected that and told me they were there if I needed anything. And I treat them the same way. Both of my parents' new partners did the same and didn't impose themselves as replacements. And nobody resents anybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That's totally different though. That's not even close to what we're talking about.\n\nOf course there are obvious differences, like the restrictions in intimacy, and the glaring issue that OPs stepdad is someone she can choose and then dump when she realizes it's not working out. But a good father and a romantic partner are both people that you usually respect, love (in different ways) and rely on. That's not something somebody can achieve by simply being persistent regardless of the other's wishes. On the contrary, going against their wishes is detrimental to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Who said anything about affection. If someone is kind to you. You respond by being kind in return. It's that simple.\n\nI repeat again. It's kind to try once. It's not kind to try repeatedly when you've been rejected. AGAIN. The problem isn't the attempt to be a father, but pushing it and being overbearing. I believe I've made this distinction multiple times (granted over several comments) now. Disregarding her feelings and wishes about the matter is not kindness. Being kind includes giving another person space when they need it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why can't she stand the individual? What happened exactly? You're allowed to say no thank-you. If you don't want to be with someone romantically, that's never an issue.\n\nIn OPs case, the way I understand it is that she didn't want him first, because she was still grieving, and later she still didn't want him because he didn't respect her time to grieve in the past. But that's not always relevant. You don't have to disclose your reasons to reject someone's advances.\n\nIt's not an issue if you don't want someone to be with you romantically. It should NOT be an issue either to reject someone trying to be your father replacement when you don't want it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now let's bring this back to the context at hand. If my daughter refused to let her siblings be in her life, even though they didn't do anything to her. Yes, she's the asshole. There's a huge difference between having a familial relationship with someone, and having a emotional romantic/sexual relationship with someone.\n\nAgain, sure, there is a difference, but neither of them should be forced.\n\nAnd \"didn't do anything to her\" doesn't apply here, because \\*once more\\*, the stepfather kept persisting about it, being overbearing and ignoring her feelings about the matter. And if she is too taken by grief to handle you and you have some actual care and concern for her, it's time for you to stop trying to forcefully obtain the role of the father. You don't go \"what can I do to to convince her to accept me\", you go \"what can be done to help her feel better?\", because a child's wellbeing isn't your show. It's about them. And from how I understand this post, this isn't what happened."]}
