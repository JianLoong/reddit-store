I\u2019m ok with being the AH if that\u2019s how it plays out, but I don\u2019t really see this as being as bad as my mom is making it out to be.\n\nMy (25F) dad died when I was 7. My mom remarried when I was 9 and had Jill (15F) and Janet (13F) with her new husband afterward. I have never liked her husband as he seemed dead set on replacing my dad and \u201cwinning me over\u201d in the most obvious and obnoxious ways possible. I tolerated him as much as I could stand, but I have always refused to allow him to be called my dad or to act as if he is in any way and when I moved out I told him not to contact me unless something was wrong with mom. I don\u2019t feel anything towards Jill and Janet and avoid them. I don\u2019t see them as siblings even if they are by blood. This upset my mom and her husband and I guess the kids, but there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. I can\u2019t feel what I don\u2019t feel and I won\u2019t fake it.\n\nSince I left home, I usually spend the holidays with my dad\u2019s parents, visit my mom without the others, and go to the reunion on her side where there are enough people that I don\u2019t have to deal with the others. This arrangement has been fine until last year when my mom asked me to stay with them. I declined. She asked me if it was because of her husband and the girls. I said yes, I feel like keeping distance there is best. She told me if I\u2019m not going to be part of her family to not come at all anymore. I said ok and still went to my grandparents and visited with members of the other side separately but didn\u2019t see her or go to the big get together. She lit my phone up like crazy trying to get me to change my mind. It was embarrassing.\n\nThis year she asked when I wanted to get together with her while I\u2019m there as if nothing happened. I told her I would respect her boundaries by not seeing her since I\u2019m not willing to play happy family with her husband and kids and she set that as a condition. She said that wasn\u2019t what she meant and she wants to see me. I told her she doesn\u2019t get to retract the ultimatum once laid out. If she wants to see me, she can travel to me without the others any time of year, but I\u2019m going to see my family for Christmas and if she doesn\u2019t want to be included in that she doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nAnyway, got a LONG screed from her husband essentially calling me an AH. Jill apparently stalks my social media and tried trolling me but I deleted her comments and blocked her without responding. I explained the situation to my grandparents on that side and they say that my mom\u2019s husband gave her an ultimatum about me so she\u2019s in a difficult place and doesn\u2019t know how to fix it. They suggested that they, my mom, and I have lunch to talk it out, but finding out that her husband was behind last year\u2019s issue makes me not want to deal with it even more.", "created_utc": 1702351083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gc96l/aita_for_forcing_my_mom_to_abide_by_the/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't get to act all flip-floppy because she didn't do a good job at blending her partner into the family and ensuring that he respects your decisions. He also doesn't have the right to message you calling you an AH when he started all of this in the first place. Don't listen to the other comments because again it is your life and you can have boundaries and decide who you want to associate with or not. Tell your grandparents that she isn't in a difficult place she just doesn't have the balls to put her foot down.

Not for setting boundaries and sticking to them, but for your apathy and I hate to say it, but it sounds like contempt for you mother having found love again. \n\nI know how hard it is to lose your dad. I just lost mine 1.5 years ago and I haven\u2019t even begun to heal or even really confront it and NO ONE could ever replace him, ever. However, mine/your mother has every right to try and move on and be happy. Your mom got so lucky and found someone that she loved again and he sounds like he tried to be nice to you, perhaps he came on too string, but it\u2019s a tough spot as a step parent. And it\u2019s hard for you too! I understand not warming to him for awhile I get it. But it\u2019s been 16 years I believe and you have sisters and you are still refusing to at least try. This is your mother. And I know for sure it kills her daily that you\u2019re not around and her kids have never been all together as a family. I think she said what she did in hurt and anger and not because she actually wanted you to stop coming to visit. \n\nPerhaps you could just try to get to know them. I fear as you get older you may regret icing them out, but it will be too late to reconcile. I know it\u2019s hard and no one is replacing your dad, but sadly life has to continue and everyone deserves to find love and companionship is this rough world. \n\nAnyways, whatever you decide I wish you and your family the best.

However, from what I gather mom doesn't seem to want that option.\n\nAbout the 18 years, where was OP's mom when step-father disrespected OP's boundaries as a child? Why didn't mom stop her husband from trying to replace someone who passed only two years prior? It sounds as if mom failed to blend the family, having the next kid when OP was 10 and the third when OP was 12. OP's mom didn't put her foot down to protect her first born and let step-father ruin the relationship between him, the kids, and OP.\n\nIt's the same yet again, OP's mom doesn't put her foot down for her child but rather lets the others once again ruin the relationship between step-father and siblings and OP. Only this time, the step-father managed to also ruin mother and OPs relationship.\n\nIt's on the parents to protect (and respect!!) the child and once the child is a grown-up, it's on the parents to pay them the same respect they want to receive/would pay any other adult.\n\nOP's NTA. Just setting boundaries, having them almost violated and saying \"fine, if you want to violate my boundaries, I'd rather not give you the chance to begin with\"\n\nEdit to add: Most likely, OP's mom chose to have OP. Why would mom's choice be something OP somehow owes her for? That is kind of a weird mindset.", "If you give ANYONE an ultimatum you don't get to take it back if you don't like how it turns out. Whoever you are. You don't get to pretend nothing happened. Mom got an ultimatum from her husband saying I will leave you if you visit your daughter while she's in town if your daughter doesn't accept me and our daughters. Mom picked her husband. Mom made her ultimatum. I will not see you if you don't accept my husband and your half siblings. OP didn't accept those terms. Mom got embarrassed. Her ultimatum backfired. Her husband has driven a huge wedge between her and her daughter. She calls trying to rugsweep and pretend she didn't make her ultimatum. \"That's not what I meant!\" What she means she didn't consider the full consequences of her actions. OP has no feelings for her half siblings good or bad. When one of the sisters hassled her on social media what does OP do she deletes the comments and doesn't respond. Life is full of choices. Mom got an ultimatum from her husband that was really unfair. She choose her husband's terms. Mom made an ultimatum that was really unfair. OP decided NOT to accept her terms. Mom called a year later pretending she didn't make an ultimatum like nothing happened. Sorry it doesn't work like that. People who make ultimatums better mean them. You better be prepared to accept ALL CONSEQUENCES. That means if a mother says to her child I will not see you if you don't accept my husband and younger children you better be prepared to not see the child you gave the ultimatum to. And if a husband tells his wife I will leave you if you visit your daughter when she's in town if she doesn't accept me and our daughters the husband better be prepared to leave his wife. Mom wanted to pretend nothing happened. She wasn't prepared for the consequences of her ultimatum and that OP wasn't going to pretend she didn't make a a huge ultimatum. It was not insignificant. Mom had everything. She had husband and 3 daughters. But her husband made her choose. Having all her family or having him. Her husband had to win. His wife chose him. Basically Mom chose her husband over her child. Yes mom is a total Saint. She threw everything away.", "She knew what she was doing.  Her husband told her he would leave her if she visited with me while I was in town if I wouldn\u2019t accept him or the kids.  She knew exactly what side her bread was buttered on. She just didn\u2019t like that I called her bluff. I can love someone and still not let them get away with manipulation. It does seem weird that I haven\u2019t spoken to her husband or kids since I left home but going out to lunch with my mom alone a couple of times a year lives rent free in their heads.", "How am I denying her new family when I acknowledge that she indeed has one, just one that does not involve me? The only thing I blame my mom for is the ultimatum and possibly for being weak when her husband was trying to force replace my dad\u2019s memory.", "Op isn't denying that their mother has a new life.  The question is how much of that new life/new family does op want to be a part of...and it seems like the answer is, not much.", "Her mum told her that if she's not going to play happy families then not to come over yeah? \n\nThe daughter hasn't said her mum can't have another family, simply that they aren't her family. \n\nIf the step dad didn't push it so much then this probably wouldn't even be an issue.\n\nNTA malicious compliance is fun when a threat backfires.", "OP literally tells us that Jill \"apparently stalks\" their social media and states in a matter-of-fact manner Jill's harassment. Trolling OP's social media to the point that OP deleted the comments and blocked Jill's account. (Which is a very adult reaction, especially considering this situation, with the step-father pushing OP's mom like this and then sending OP a message. Sounds to me like Jill is copying step-fathers actions.) \n\nSafe to say, there's some overstepping behavior here and resentment from at least Jill.", "You are their older sister and what you are indirectly saying is that you wish they didn\u2019t exist, that you wish they had never been born. That classifies as \u201ctreating them like shit.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cstuck on you not being there\u201d because you\u2019re their family member and you don\u2019t care about them at all! That must hurt. YTA", "I don't disagree that her mother was wrong, and I said so above. \n\nBut the cold and callous way OP spoke about her mother and punishing her for her mistakes still makes her TA. In my view, of course.\n\nBut while I don't have any kids of my own (this kind of shit is one of the reasons why), I do have a lovely stepdaughter, so maybe I'm just biased because I've seen how loving and generous hearted a daughter can be. And maybe the comparison is what makes OP seem like TA to me.", "It\u2019s totally up to you how you address the relationship. I just promise in 20 years you are never going to look back and think man I sure regret attempting to repair my relationship with my mother. Even if it doesn\u2019t work, atleast you can say you tried.", "Jill only started after she cut her mom off, and Janet isn't mentioned negatively in any way.", "I\u2019m no one\u2019s older sister except on paper and paper is only worth anything when the law gets involved.  I do wish they didn\u2019t exist, but only because I wish my dad was still alive.  Since he\u2019s not, I just don\u2019t care whether they exist or not, they\u2019re not my problem.  Learning how to deal with someone not being there is something we all deal with.  Biology doesn\u2019t entitle them to my time.", "I understand your point of view, however, as someone on the other side (not the same but a similar situation) I'm aware of how not getting the help one needs from the parent can stick with someone.\n\nOP's mom simply wasn't there to protect OP (and the memory of OP's father) when it was heavily needed, so now OP seems to be rather neutral. They do state that they love their mom, so perhaps it's just a point of view kind of thing, like you said? That it seems cold and callous to you, but in actuality may just be OP being tired of the way their mom puts the step-father first, like she did for 14 years. Another commenter said it, OP's mother is reaping what she sowed.", "Just because Jill only started after OP told their mom no (not cut her off, just said no and still offered that OP's mom could come to visit OP!) which is also when step-father sent OP a text calling them an ah for a situation he caused, doesn't make it less bad behavior. If Jill would've contacted OP to ask what's going on, I would've understood. But trolling on your supposed siblings social media right during/after this situation? Speaks volumes about Jill.", "Perhaps you're right.\n\nI feel terribly sorry for her mother, though.", "Me too. I think that, if they got married (I don't know if I remember this part correctly) two years after OP's father passed, that OP's mom might not have been in a good place. Probably just wanting the family to work because she missed the family she had when OP's father was alive. Instead she got stuck with this step-father and now tries to still have a relationship with her firstborn child, even though that seems difficult in the moment.\n\nI went a few years without contact with specific family members and am currently sort of reconnecting. I do hope that OP will get there, as well.", "What a kind thing to say. I hope it all works out for you!", "So do I :D\n\nThank you & thanks for hearing me out"]}
