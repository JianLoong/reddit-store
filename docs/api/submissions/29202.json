And I think you all need to sit down and talk without the emotions. \n\nDo you think they\u2019re scared? Has your diet or weight loss been extreme?

Now, that\u2019s a general guideline and there are some body types that don\u2019t fall within the norm. If you think that is you, ask your mom to take you to your pediatrician for a physical. It\u2019s tough at your age because you\u2019re gaining autonomy/maturity, but also, you may not always see the bigger picture the way your parents or doctor can and THAT can be an annoyingly tough pill to swallow. And it is normal for a person your age to go through periods of weight gain/loss due to growth. I worry that you might be trying to achieve a physique that conflicts with your overall health. Your focus on low-calorie food in this post makes me wonder if you\u2019re overlooking the importance of nutrition. Connecting with a registered dietician could help you find the balance and set you up for long-term success as you approach adulthood.

Your parents, albeit they care about you, should be more concerned about you if your weight and/or physical appearance are an issue to you, regardless of whether they think you\u2019re right or not, because you could develop an eating disorder if you don\u2019t deal with it the right way. Is your mother controlling though? I don\u2019t think she is (as I say, she cares about you), but she should have dealt with the situation in a different way, expressing her concerns to you before acting out like that.

I bet we're both naturally small women (my measurements are a lot like yours, although I'm not giving numbers) and honestly it is *so hurtful* the way everyone conflates \"being small\" with \"hurting yourself trying to be small\".  You might just have one of those bodies where 5'5\" 105 is your baseline. We exist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna be blunt, though - you do sound like you have an eating disorder. That's not to do with your size, not at all, or your desire to be healthy, but to do with the way you *speak* about food. You do need to seek treatment. You do need to find help. \"Having a healthy relationship with what you eat\" also doesn't mean you're gonna quadruple in size; while I never had an eating disorder, my relationship with food was also poor, and my body *has not changed* now that I have a substantially better relationship with food. You aren't broken, you're just a little out of wack at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've got a lot of people calling you the asshole for calling your mom controlling, because of the \"probable eating disorder\" thing. But here's the thing - her behavior *is not helping*. It is controlling asshole behavior. It *is* controlling for her to throw your food out, if you paid for it with your own money. It *is* controlling (and absurd) for her to assume that she can berate you into magically not having an eating disorder. That's not how therapy works. Plus, a lot of eating disorders are about feeling like you *lack* control, so she's unintentionally making the situation worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bet you, like me, heard a lot of \"you're so *thin*!\" growing up, as a compliment. It's so easy to hear that and assume that thinness is the only thing of value about you. It's going to be hard to shake that until you have a Something Else intrinsic that you value and other people value. But the way there isn't for your mom to yell at you, and her yelling is actively hurting you. It's going to be hard to feel like you have worth when someone's screaming at you for wanting to feel healthy. My mom was like this too, and I totally get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how do you fix this? Cause I don't think you're the asshole, and I think your mom is being a *tiny* bit of one, but I don't think she intends to be. And I think you genuinely want a healthy body and a healthy diet *and* a healthy relationship with yourself and with your mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople have suggested a pediatrician. That's a good idea, and I think that if you *asked your mom* if she could take you to the pediatrician, she'd be relieved. Let's operate under the assumption that she loves you and she's frightened. Just be open to the idea that the pediatrician might also say that you have an eating disorder, and please be willing to trust the expert on that. I think you could also maybe cook and eat with your mom? Make a salad with her so that she understands that you are (probably) still feeling full from what you eat, and so (in case this is part of what's happening) she can understand how much better healthy food makes you feel. But also make cookies or something with her, and *eat some of the cookies*. One cookie isn't going to destroy you, I promise. Engage with the meal-planning and the family cooking. That way, you've got a sense of control over your diet (autonomy matters!), and your mom can also feel reassured about what you're eating. And if your family really are just eating unhealthily high-calorie processed stuff, then you can help them too. Make sure that you eat at the table with your family (if that's an option for everyone's schedules). Talk to your friends (not about your food or your body or their food or their bodies) and listen to what they say they love about you. Is it your smile? Your attitude? Your stubbornness? Your wit? These things are all you, as much as your body is. These things will not change with your size or your shape, and these things are deeply valuable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, your instincts are good. A lot of the \"diet\" branded stuff *is* a scam. And if your body feels better to live in when you're eating salads, eat salads. They don't have to be \"diet\" salads. Your mom *is* being unhelpful, even if it's coming from a place of love. Trusting your instincts and what your body has to say is how you come to have a truly healthy relationship with yourself and your food. It's okay for that to include things like \"craving something deep-fried\" as well as \"drinking water\" and \"eating vegetables\". Trust the little voice deep inside that says \"actually, you're worthy as you are\", because that's a good instinct too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA.\n\nHey, OP?

Otherwise, no). \n\nYour parents tossed your food because they are likely scared for you. Please see your doctor. You need help.", "Im 5'5 and weigh 150 and my doctor said I'm still too skinny \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d, I am so concentrated for this girl", "You do realize you\u2019re giving weight loss advice to a 105 lbs 16 year old, right? She\u2019s underweight and on an extreme calorie deficit right now and is heading towards hospitalization.", "While BMI is imperfect, it does effectively serve as a guideline for healthy weights.", "It's only racist if your fat.", "Hi!  Is it your lower abdomen?  I used to obsess about how pudgy mine was (in comparison to how thin the rest of me was, I guess it did look bigger).  Women are supposed to hold fat around their lower abdomen. Their upper thighs. Their butts. Women have died from starving themselves and still had a slight bump there.  The reason models in magazines don\u2019t have them is it\u2019s photoshopped out (and they are too thin as well).  It develops during your teen years though so some of your friends might not have it yet. \n\nI don\u2019t know you. But I\u2019m asking you for this.  Go to your doctor. Like, for a checkup.  Tell your doctor that you feel like you need to lose weight and ask their advice.  That\u2019s all you need to do. Be weighed and measured by a doctor and tell them you feel fat at X spot on your body.  \n\nMaybe we are all wrong. But ask that medical professional.  If they say what you are doing is safe, then tell your parents.  Heck, invite your mother to come with you for the checkup. Then the doc can tell her too.  \n\nJust be healthy.  Your body is still growing.  What you eat/don\u2019t eat now can affect you for the rest of your life.  You need a certain amount of good nutrition for your brain and skin and teeth to be healthy.  You shouldn\u2019t be eating icecream and fried chicken every day but you also shouldn\u2019t be eating Lean Cuisine and diet snacks every day either.", "It does. Which is why at 142 lbs at 5\u20194\u201d I start getting concerned people taking to me about my weight being too skinny. \n\n105 and 5\u20195\u201d is really tiny. There\u2019s many people who that\u2019s a very worrying size. \n\nI don\u2019t think your parents were the most sensitive about what they did. But they are trying in their own way to help you. \n\nGood luck, and I really hope you can get the help you need.", "If your concern is how you look, maybe focus on toning exercises. Please don\u2019t read this wrong and think I mean do cardio for hours a day. I mean things to build muscle tone. \n\nI\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d (I apparently lost an inch in height when my back gave out on me). I would look deathly ill at 105 lbs. Shit, my friends started being concerned for me at 145 lbs because of my weight loss that is medically related. I\u2019m 130 now and my family is constantly questioning my health. I get that it\u2019s annoying that they are questioning you but this feels like a legit concern. Being 105 lbs absolutely does not sound like a weight that one would look fat and overweight at when they are 5\u20195\u201d. \n\nYour parents sound like they have no idea what to do to help you. Please look into doctors and/or therapists. A nutritionist even.", "Sweetie, ask your parents to take you to the doctor. Talk to your doctor about losing weight- tell them everything. They'll be able to help you.", "Absolutely. At the height(or low) of my anorexia, I was 5\"\n'2 and weighed 94lbs. And I still looked in the mirror and saw \"too big.\" This girl needs help, and though her parents seem to realise this, they are definitely not going the right way about helping her. This needs medical professionals.", "Dont get me wrong this whole situation was handled wrong. They 100% are wrong for throwing away your food BUT that is them just going about the problem wrong and they THINK they are helping you because you very obviously have a eating disorder. They shouldn't have handled it like this but you are wrong. You absolutely have food issues and they are trying to do thier best even tho they did it wrong. YOU have an ed and they are trying to not have you die but are going about it wrong. They may have hurt your feelings but they aren't wrong for trying to stop it. You have serious issues that need to be delt with, but they also need to learn the proper way to deal with them. You are completely in denial about your problems and trying to make it seem like it's just them them attacking you and that's not the situation at all.", "You need to be doubling that you body is literally dying. Your not losing a few pounds your body is eating itself alive", "Calories are good fat is good. The only thing to avoid is sugar.  Your body will use 3k calories a day doing very little", "Not calories, kiddo. Fuel for your body.", "And, if she doesn't get help soon, potentially a lifetime of physical side effects to go with the obvious mental/emotional ones - fertility issues, osteoporosis, and more!", "I don't mean to scare you here but 95lbs at 5'5\" is more dangerous than you would think. Being that underweight can cause irreversible damage to your internal organs. There are other health risks as well with varying severity, but i want to underscore that being underweight puts you in serious danger. At 105 you're already at risk, and being thinner will only increase that. I've been 95lbs. And when I was, i was getting blood tests every 3 months because the doctor was concerned that I would go into organ failure. In media, the health risks of being underweight are severly underplayed.\n\nI don't blame you, I don't think anyone here blames you. It's not your fault that you feel the way that you do. Please try and talk to someone about this. It's really hard and it sucks", "No, it doesn't.", "Wow, sanity in this thread. The skinnier you get, the smaller your life. Fewer hobbies, friends, goals, thoughts.....", "And there's a reason that sometimes, no matter how skinny you get, as a woman you can't seem to lose weight from those areas. And you know why that is? Because protecting your reproductive organs is one of your body's HIGHEST priorities. It will do everything it can to try to avoid removing the \"protective packaging\" from those areas.", "Under-rated comment. OP isn't shedding a few extra pounds, her body is literally consuming critically important parts of its mass to sustain itself, hoping that in doing so it makes it past the \"famine\" it is assuming OP is in.\n\nIf this post is real, it makes the list of saddest things I've read in the past week or so, and it's been an absolutely record-breaking week of sad shit.", "Yep. You\u2019ll keep that fat even as your heart gives out.  Its terrifying", "A therapist is there to **help** you.  If you don't feel comfortable with them, they're not the right therapist for you.  Sometimes, you have to meet with more than one until you find the right one.  (I realized I could trust my current one when I saw a picture of him with Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.  If you can't trust a Trekkie, who can you trust, right? lol)\n\nPlease do give it a try.  I think you'll find therapists are generally very kind, patient people.  And they truly have your best interests at heart.", "That\u2019s because the disorder doesn\u2019t want you to change it\u2019s protecting itself you have to fight it out of you", "That\u2019s understandable, it can be very hard to open up to someone, especially someone you aren\u2019t familiar with, but finding the right therapist can really go a long way in helping you develop a healthier relationship with yourself. I think what your mom did was absolutely 100% not ok even if it did come from a place of concern, and I think the best thing right now would be for you and your parents to have an honest conversation about your diet and about how you\u2019re feeling. That can be really scary, I know it can, I was 25 when I finally admitted to my mom that I was struggling with my mental and it scared the absolute shit out of me, but it was the right thing to do because it was the first step towards me admitting I needed help and towards getting help. So maybe just think about being a little more open with them, and do consider trying therapy, and try to look at it as someone who\u2019s only there to help you and who *wants* to help you, because they do want to help.", "You do need them or you are going to die sooner than later", "I've unfortunately had friends with eating disorders, and while there's no shortage of reasons it's *possible* this is suspicious, this isn't one of them. OP's anorexia seems pretty advanced so everything matters.\n\nBut it's not just the calories. At least in my admittedly limited and purely anecdotal experience, my friends with eating disorders just... weren't allowed to enjoy food. Like food was something you limited yourself to the absolute tiniest amount of and you would punish yourself even for *that.* It was kind of like, the fact that you even had to deign to eat made you terrible and a failure, and if you *liked* it? Oh my god."]}
