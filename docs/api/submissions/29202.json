And I think you all need to sit down and talk without the emotions. \n\nDo you think they\u2019re scared? Has your diet or weight loss been extreme?

Now, that\u2019s a general guideline and there are some body types that don\u2019t fall within the norm. If you think that is you, ask your mom to take you to your pediatrician for a physical. It\u2019s tough at your age because you\u2019re gaining autonomy/maturity, but also, you may not always see the bigger picture the way your parents or doctor can and THAT can be an annoyingly tough pill to swallow. And it is normal for a person your age to go through periods of weight gain/loss due to growth. I worry that you might be trying to achieve a physique that conflicts with your overall health. Your focus on low-calorie food in this post makes me wonder if you\u2019re overlooking the importance of nutrition. Connecting with a registered dietician could help you find the balance and set you up for long-term success as you approach adulthood.

Your parents, albeit they care about you, should be more concerned about you if your weight and/or physical appearance are an issue to you, regardless of whether they think you\u2019re right or not, because you could develop an eating disorder if you don\u2019t deal with it the right way. Is your mother controlling though? I don\u2019t think she is (as I say, she cares about you), but she should have dealt with the situation in a different way, expressing her concerns to you before acting out like that.

I know my friend's mom would have spent a million dollars if it could have made her daughter better.", "That's a fairly large calorie deficit.  I'm concerned that your definition of \"a normal amount\" is skewed. \nI very kindly suggest you speak to an athletic trainer, nutritionist, coach or health professional about your fitness goals.", "Babe that's disordered eating. It's absolutely not your fault--I'm *sure* you're getting those numbers from \"legitimate\" sources and that you're getting a lot of messages telling you it's good/reasonable even though it absolutely is not--but you could ruin your life (and your metabolism) if you keep this up.\n\nIt's not clear to me from the replies if folks are getting through to you or if you're just kind of hoping it all dies down... But you are so young. There is so much beauty and potential in your life. I really, truly hope you take this to heart. No matter what size you are, you deserve to be happy.", "that right there is the issue. Stop thinking of all food as calories. That isnt healhy eating or thinking.", "Spices and seasonings add little, if any, calories. Avoid cream and fatty sauces, use fresh ingredients and explore the spice aisle of your grocery store. Grill a lean fish with some zatar or five spice seasoning; butterfly a chicken breast and cook it with some extra virgin olive oil, garlic, squash, tomatoes and spinach. You don't need to stick to plain, boring food.\n\nTruthfully you may want to get a healthy food cookbook, preferably by one from an actual chef.", "Agreed. The flavored fizzy waters are good too.", "95 pounds at 5\u20195\u201d is dangerously thin.", "Honey, that's WAY too thin.  Dangerously unhealthy.  As a mom myself I can tell you that your mother is acting out of fear for your safety.\n\nPLEASE talk to a professional.  This is way above Reddit's pay grade.", "Go to your parents and ask them to take you to the doctor. You need professional help to understand what an ideal weight for you is. Skipping meals is not normal. It appears you are underweight. A doctor and a nutritionist will help you find the best way of eating for you.", "My mom was around 95lbs when she was in the middle of a bad mental breakdown, underweight and sick. At rock bottom she was clocking in at 75lbs...at 5'0\", looking like a living skeleton. She's 130lbs now, a healthy (not overweight) size per her doctor. I strongly recommend you speak to a doctor and a therapist.", "I'm sorry, but this is absolutely horrible, and you need therapy and ED treatment immediately. 95 lbs at 5'5 is crazy and would harm you terribly. I'm not trying to be mean, but this is so deeply concerning and you're obviously not thinking clearly.", "I think from your other comments, she may be concerned you're not getting enough nutrition. Please consider sitting down with her and trying to calmly find out where she's coming from? \n\nYou are still a minor child and she and your father are legally and morally obligated to attend to your health and well being. Unfortunately, it sounds like she's not sure how to address her concerns regarding your health.  I kindly suggest you speak to her about your fitness goals and find out if she thinks they are good for you.", "You\u2019re talking about an antiquated and steeped in racism tool to discuss health across all bodies. Google is free", "alright thank you", "I don't know just kinda makes me uncomfortable thinking about talking about this stuff with someone", "thank you <3", "but it's still calories I don't need thank you though I'll think about it", "okay thank you sm", "You can also Google unhealthy eating and eating disorders. A doctor would tell her she is too thin and would be worried about her. Get off your soap box. We are talking about her health and safety. My friend died of an eating disorder, and OP sounds a lot like her.", "I have battled eating disorders for as long as I can remember and your post sent immediate red flags up for me. I\u2019ve done it all, over eat, under eat, eat and throw up, fad diets, etc, it truly is an illness. I can tell you that I\u2019ve done irreversible harm to my body (particularly my teeth, I have to have them all pulled between shit genetics, throwing up, and meds my teeth are shot to shit.)\n\nAs a mother to a girl only a little younger than you, I\u2019m pleading for you to reach out and talk to someone for support and how you see/feel about yourself. You know as well as I do that this isn\u2019t just about being thin or pretty (though that is part of it), it\u2019s about control. You can\u2019t control a lot of things in life, but this is something you can control. You\u2019re getting a sense of satisfaction from being able to control what goes into your body and what you can do to look \u201cgood.\u201d \n\nUnfortunately, that high from being in control of something is NEVER going to be enough. It\u2019s going to be another 5lbs, another 8 lbs, etc. \n\nI don\u2019t know how your typical relationship is with your mother and father, but you need to talk to a trusted adult. When I was your age (god I feel old), I tried to tell my own mother that I was struggling with my body image and having issues with food. She got mad and yelled at me and called me attention seeking and then threatened to have me hospitalized. That was the last time I ever spoke about it to her. From ages of 19-22ish I was 98 lbs, same height as you. I look back on those pictures and can see how dangerously skinny I was. You could count all my ribs and my vertebrae.\n\n. If you think your mom will respond in a somewhat similar way as mine, is there another adult you can turn to? A counselor? Teacher?\n\nMy DM\u2019s are open, I\u2019m happy to talk with you if you need it, but this is your life on the line and I strongly recommend seeking some sort of professional help.\n\n(I do agree that your mom tossing the food that you paid for is a dick move and she should behave better as a parent.)", "If you're worried about the (absolutely negligible) amount of calories in spices and seasonings, then I'm worried. That's a sign of disordered eating. Healthy eating is *not* about eating the least calories you can; healthy eating is about eating a balanced diet, with portions that come to around or slightly under your body's maintainance calories. \n\nYour parents seem to be going about this all the wrong way, but they may be right in worrying that you're not eating enough. Ask them to make you an appointment with a doctor (if you're in the US, you want a dietician (and not a nutritionist), but the terminology in other countries varies), to check how healthy you actually are. If you're overweight and do need to keep eating leaner, the dietician can convince your parents and give you advice about the best foods to meet your goals. If you're underweight, they can give advice about that too.", "It really sounds like you have disordered eating. It\u2019s time to talk to a professional. Good luck.", "If you really think that spices are a calorie you should be counting, then I really don't think your parents have gone nearly far enough. This is extremely disordered eating.", "I'm starting to think your username is sus. Burner, who is adverse to food, seems kinda hyperbolic, and the whole calorie thing when replying to a comment about spices that contain zero calories seems equally insincere. If you are sincere, I pray you'll follow the good advice many have offered you.", "I\u2019m sorry about your friend. \n\nNo one said OP didn\u2019t have disordered eating; if you take a sec and look at my other comment in this thread you can see I replied to OP\u2019s comment that it sounds like she has an eating disorder and she should speak to a professional. It\u2019s not a soap box to consider how the multitude of people who aren\u2019t white feel re: the BMI scale.  \n\nOP needs help. Also true, we can all try be better when we are talking about health in general.", "You took a situation and made it about race. I am sorry, but I am going to focus on the health and safety of this 16 year old. You responded to MY comment indicating the BMI scale was rascist. That was not the time or place, which is probably why so many people downvoted you. We are trying to help her. I don't want to see another person die if I can help them.\n\nAnd don't report me to reddit care again.", "You\u2019re very predictable and love to center yourself. \n\nI didn\u2019t report you. \n\nMy love, you\u2019re mad? Stay mad until you\u2019re not mad. \n\nAnd regarding getting downvoted for stating something was racist? I\u2019ll wear it as a badge of honor."]}
