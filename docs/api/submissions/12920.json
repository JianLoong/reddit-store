{"id": 12920, "submission_id": "11yj4ie", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go through the heavily religious process of becoming my nephew's godfather?", "selftext": "My sister-in-law, Stephanie, recently had a baby. Stephanie wants my partner (Kate, Stephanie's sister) and I to be his godparents. I was honored, and initially agreed.       \n\nThe trouble came a week ago, when we sat down to discuss the process of becoming godparents. Kate's family is Catholic - not strict or devout, but Stephanie still wants her son to be baptized through the church.      \n\nI found out that in order to be a godfather, I'd basically be required to become Catholic. I'd need to be confirmed by the church and would be \"strongly encouraged\" to attend weekly mass, pay tithes, etc., after being confirmed. Kate and I would also need to meet with a priest to \"discuss our living situation\", because we live together (we have been together for 14 years) but are not married through the Catholic church.     \n\n\nI'm not religious (if I had to identify, I'd probably say agnostic, maybe leaning toward atheistic) and I don't feel comfortable with converting to Catholicism in order to be my nephew's godfather. I explained this to Stephanie, and she got *very* upset.  \n     \n\n\n\nShe said I should be willing to \"go through the steps\" and that I could just not participate in the religious aspect afterwards - i.e., go through the process of officially becoming Catholic, and after the baptism I could dip out on attending church, tithing, etc.     \n\n\nI'm very firm in my decision that I don't want to go through with this, but Stephanie is insistent that since I won't \"really be Catholic\" it won't make a difference in my life. She says \"you'll just be Catholic on paper.\"       \n\n\n\nStephanie is now threatening to not let us be involved in her son's life anymore. She told Kate \"if he's not devoted enough to [nephew] to do this, does he really care about [nephew]?\" and \"How much can he really care about you if he is willing to ruin your relationship with [nephew] just because he doesn't want to  jump through a few hoops?\"                             \n\nKate is fine with my decision. It is possible for a child to only have one godparent, and since she's Catholic, she would be willing to be the sole godparent. Stephanie isn't okay with this option, and says \"it's both of you or neither of you.\"      \n\n\n\nAITA for not wanting to be involved in this process if it requires me to join a religion I don't feel comfortable with, even if I wouldn't technically be required to \"participate\" in the religion after the baptism ceremony was over?", "created_utc": 1679491669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yj4ie/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_through_the_heavily/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is preferred, but it's not necessary. Also, I am not sure Stephanie understands what goes into becoming Catholic. You don't take a few classes and you're done. It is a year long process with a lot of meetings, personal discussion, and evaluation. It is A LOT to ask. If Stephanie is throwing out ultimatums, let her. Call her bluff. The bottom line is she is expecting you to follow her beliefs for her convenience, but she will not allow you to follow yours. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou could, if you wished, discuss this with Stephanie's priest. A good priest will not allow a conversion that isn't wholehearted and may be able to talk Stephanie down from her ridiculous stance. This must come up all the time in his parish. He may have some good ideas about how to incorporate a Godmother and a Christian Witness (basically what you'd be if you're not Catholic) into the ceremony.\n\nAnd there's no reason why you can't \"just be a godfather on paper\" (that is, not officially through the church but still be *called* a godfather). There are millions of godfathers out there that aren't Catholic. Stephanie is disrespecting her priest, her child, her religion, **you** and her church with this utterly unreasonable request.", "NTA. You are supposed to join a religion because you believe. \"Going through the steps\" would be insulting to that deity and to true believers of the religion. Does Stephanie realize that, or is she religious for appearances? Either way, if you did do what she wants, then I would say you were the AH, like Stephanie.", "NTA, but your SIL is a huge one. So she is going to keep her nephew from knowing her Aunt and Uncle because of this? She is selfish and doing her child a disservice. And furthermore, it sounds like she is trying to turn your partner against you, what an AH.", "NTA. They're making a mockery of the ceremony by trying to push it on you. If they know and trust you and honesty want you to be part of their child's life, they can certainly do that with no religious overtones.\n\nAnd if they truly want someone to commit to assisting with their child's religious education and possibly raising them in the catholic faith should anything happen to the parents, clearly you aren't that person and they shouldn't try to force you.", "NTA, because Stephanie and her family need to know that you can still be a good role model in her son's life without being religious. If she can't accept that then just find someone else or forgo having a godfather.", "NTA.  It's so weird that some religious people think it's ok to explicitly encourage people to fake being religious.  What's the point?  Do they think they're tricking God?", "What if you weren't agnostic/atheist, but rather Muslim or Hindu?

Since when was it this much of a hassle to be someone's kid's godparent?", "Easy NTA.", "NTA, I was raised Catholic but not confirmed, so I couldn\u2019t be a godparent to my neice.\n\nIn the Catholic tradition, the godparent guides the child through the catholic rituals.  It\u2019s a job, not an honorific.  You are not eligible because you don\u2019t believe.  It\u2019s not just believing in god, it\u2019s believing in Catholicism.\n\nStephanie needs to get over herself.  If you are honest with the church, they will try to indoctrinate you or say you are ineligible regardless of what actions you take.  It\u2019s about enforcing belief on young people.", "NTA.  This is nuts.", "NTA - is there something else going on with Stephanie and her attitude towards you? This situation seems less like a genuine attempt to have a catholic godparent and more about using this situation to try and damage your relationship with your partner. \n\nAlso when you agree to be a godparent you are committing to raise them in that faith - so \u2018you\u2019ll just be catholic on paper\u2019 doesn\u2019t really work. Not to mention I\u2019m sure the priest wouldn\u2019t like that she\u2019s pushing conversion to the faith as a box ticking exercise", "NTA. Frankly, it would be disrespectful and inappropriate for you to become a catholic with no belief or desire to follow through. Stephanie is being unreasonable, and I have to wonder if she has other family pushing for this. It seems like your compromise would be very reasonable. You could even add on hosting a post-ceremony luncheon and swearing your own non-Catholic \"godfather oath\" in front of friends and family to demonstrate commitment in a way that doesn't involve straight up lying to a church to disingenuously convert.", "NTA the fact that she is trying to choose a non religious person for the role shows she is only doing it for appearances anyway and that should tell you something if not everything.\n\nEdit: I want to add this too. You\u2019re probably better off in the long run having a more distant relationship with this kid than you otherwise planned. Someone willing to use access to their children as a weapon is never going to stop that behavior so might as well never get attached. My wife\u2019s sister is one of these and since we decided to remain cordial with our ex-BIL (didn\u2019t take sides, just didn\u2019t take *her* side) we were told not to see the kids. They\u2019ll be adults soon and figure out what a monster their mother is and we\u2019ll be there for them when they do but it still sucks.", "NTA. You don\u2019t join a religion because of an obligation or a requirement. You join a religion because you are called, and not by a priest. Don\u2019t play the church's games. They just want your tithes.", "NTA and nobody should ever be forced to convert or subscribe to any aspect of any religion they don't want to!  \n\nWhen my son was baptised (husband and I were not catholics and it was at his request as a teenager, we never took him to church, he asked to go!) we only needed one Catholic Godparent, his second didn't need to be Catholic, they just had to have been christened at any point in their life and it didn't matter if they no longer went to church.  \n\nMy husband and most of my family and friends were christened as babies but now follow no religion whatsoever so it's definitely common here so was just thinking if that's the case for you and you wanted to be a Godparent without converting maybe you do already meet the 'rules' without SIL realising! Having said that, I've never heard of paying tithes so maybe wherever you are the church 'rules' are different.", "NTA. Stefanie has lost all perspective but she can't start a war if you drop your end of the rope. Keep repeating \"that won't be possible,\" remind her every month or so that you are both thrilled about the baby and see if she regains her sanity.", "NTA, but is this a requirement of the church or Kate?  Here in my neck of the woods, to baptize a child in the Roman Catholic church, only one of the godparents actually needs to be an officially confirmed Roman Catholic.  I am the godmother of my niece, but I am not Roman Catholic, her godfather is though.", "NTA!  This is ridiculous religious blackmail.", "NTA but Stephanie is. The purpose of having godparents for your children is to have someone who will help raise your child in the Catholic faith while they grow up and if anything happens to the parents.\n\nIf you are not a willing practicing Catholic, you would be unsuitable for that role. That's why you would have to jump through so many hoops to be the baby's godfather. This is nothing against you. You would just not be a good fit for the role.\n\nYour wife could be, though, but will likely not be allowed. Since you two are not married in the Catholic Church, she is in a state of mortal sin according to their guidelines. It is unlikely she would be approved as a godparent by the Church even if she is Catholic.\n\nIf Kate is approved, Stephanie can pick another male family member or friend to be the godfather. In fact many families do this to spread the honor among different couples who are related or close to the family.\n\nStephanie is being completely out of line. She seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the role is really for and is weaponizing it. She is totally wrong and shouldn't be holding your relationship with her child hostage over this. She should not want a person who has no intention of being a practicing Catholic as her child's godfather. It seems she is more concerned about appearances than the faith formation of her child.", "NTA. They're being ridiculous with requiring you to become Catholic. Kate should just become godmother herself, you'll still be there in the kid's life anyway since you're her partner.", "NTA\n\nI'm a \"godmother\" but just as a verbal promise even if I already Catholic, lol. I didn't like the process and the rites either and I was too busy at that time.", "No no no no no no no no no you are most certainly and undeniably not the AH. You've stated that your Agnostic leaning towards atheistic and that's absolutely fine and we'll within your rights it is absolutely disgusting that they're trying to pressure you into this when you clearly stated that you are uncomfortable converting it's your choice not to convert the fact that she's trying to say that \"your not wanting to because you don't want to be a godparent to your nephew\" is utter bs. And to top it off it's not about just being one on paper and skipping out on the \"duties\" it's about the principal of it all and how I'm pretty sure based on your post conversion to Catholicism goes directly against your morality. Also it is extremely disgusting that she's trying to threaten you with \"you'll never be apart of his life unless you do this\" or to simplify it \"my way or the highway\" as if that's going to change your mind. I'm sorry for what you're going through and I genuinely wish you could have done it even if it's not \"official\" or if she would have settled with your partner being the sole godparent but no. Don't cave into the pressure, stand your ground and firmly tell her that you under no circumstances will convert even if it's \"just on paper\" because that's your choice and nothing she can say or do will shake your decision and be sure to discuss this with your partner beforehand to make sure they're onboard. Just pe prepared for her to go NC afterwards because from what you described she doesn't sound like she's going to budge", "NTA\n\nIf joining a religion is so flippant to her, why does she care if you do it or not? In no way is it reasonable to expect religious conversion to be godparents to a child. Also is this normal or a particularly hardcore Catholic church? At least in the Catholic churches I grew up in (northeast US) I've never heard of these types of requirements on the godparents (or have I heard of anyone really tithing beyond throwing some dollars in the basket at mass).", "NTA.\n\nThat is a ridiculous request, and the blackmail of cutting you out of your nephew's life adds extreme insult to insult.\n\nShe's also not respecting her own faith if she just wants you to convert for show.\n\nKate offered a more than fair compromise, and Stephanie is still being an entitled AH. I'm sorry. This phase may pass, and you'll be able to enjoy your nephew. Or maybe your SIL is just such an AH that it just won't happen.\n\nEither way, don't convert (or pretend to convert) to Catholicism under duress.", "NTA. Maybe I\u2019ve been on this sub too long, but has Stephanie herself ever expressed concern with your living situation?  It almost feels like she\u2019s leveraging nephew to achieve an end.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m Catholic and I know the process of converting is long, time consuming, and should be done willingly and truthfully. Only one god parent needs to be Catholic. If your partner is Catholic you can be the godfather without converting. My godfather isn\u2019t Catholic and my son\u2019s godmother isn\u2019t Catholic. \n\nI\u2019m really uncomfortable with your SIL\u2019s expectations. She wants you to lie your way through a religious conversion and then lie during her child\u2019s baptism.", "NTA\n\nWould she be willing to baptize the baby in the Episcopal church? Is basically the same but much less strict", "The Catholic Church can also overrule your choice for godparents for various reasons. My wife and I chose her brother and his SO, but we were told we couldn\u2019t use them because they were unmarried. Been together for 15 years with a child and a house they co-own but that wasn\u2019t good enough. Forced to use my elderly in laws instead.", "NTA and Kate sounds manipulative and entitled.\n\nEDIT for accuracy: Stephanie sounds manipulative and entitled.", "ESH, you should have declined if your not catholic.   Being a Godfather means you will ensure the child is raised in the eyes of God,  as a catholic.   They never should have asked you.", "Nta, But I think you should reconsider.\n\nYou don't have to do much and it's all mumbo jumbo anyways. It's like playing tea party with a kid.

Either that or she's doing this to please someone else.   It takes roughly 2 years for an adult to convert to Catholicism.   Is she serious about waiting 2 years for the baptism?  I  doubt it.  Catholics are serious about baptism happening asap.  \n\nWhat I suspect is that she wants you to pretend to be a Catholic so that her church will perform the baptism.   She wants you to sign the papers because the priest can't perform the ceremony without at least one godparent.  She's probably afraid that if she chooses an actual Catholic,  she might get pressured to follow through on the commitment she's going to swear to at the baptism.

Why would she want a real baptism anyway? Just hire a stand-in to play a priest.\n\nOption 2: find a church which doesn't require the Godfather to belong to the same faith.

Quite frankly, your SIL is a moron. Not trying to be harsh or belittle your beliefs, but it is explicitly stated in the rubrics and the baptismal ceremony that the function of the godparents are to take over in the absence of the parents and raise the child to be a good Catholic.

Of course this all depends on where you live and the degree of religious insanity in the area.

I answered all the questions honestly, and the church representative told me I didn't qualify, and said she would be putting the paperwork in the church records.

I really wish, if a godparent is required for baptism, that she would just let Kate be the official godparent and I could be... an honorary one, or one in name only.

Their parents both passed away recently, and we are the only close family Stephanie has now.

Such deceit is about the exact opposite of raising them in the faith in fact.\n\nSadly, Kate possibly wouldn't qualify on her own due to your living arrangement (which would require you to convert prior to marrying to resolve, putting you back in the same boat).  I get the Stephanie is light on practicing family members, but they don't require godparents to be blood related I don't think.", "Honestly, it was probably the unmarried co-habitating part that disqualified you... They definetly look down on that.\n\nI've had four kids baptized in three different catholic churchs. Each time only one of the godparents was catholic. I am also the godfather to a child, my wife the godmother and she is not catholic.", "No. Godparenthood is a religious thing.\n\nA guardian is someone who takes in a child if their parents were to die, or become physically or mentally incapable of parenting.\n\nOf course a godparent can also be a guardian. In many cultures, a godparent is also expected to be a guardian if the child's parents pass away or become incapable of parenting. But not all guardians are godparents. After all, not everyone is religious.\n\nMany people make the mistake of using the word 'godparent' when they mean 'guardian'. I am on the childfree subreddit a lot, and the topic of taking in nieces and nephews if their parents were to die is discussed there every now and then. People constantly say 'godparent' when they actually mean 'guardian'.", "...it's...literally in the name.  The whole ceremony is about religion.", "That makes it all the better. It shows he's truly devote to his religion he doesn't believe in. It makes it harder to make him change to another religion to not believe in.", "I wish I could say \"Go to the church and tell them how they're behaving\", but manipulating others with guilt is right up their alley so they'd probably approve.", ">going Catholic, in title only\n\nnuh-uh. The \"funny\" thing about requirements for catholic godparents is that, if they were baptized catholic, it doesn't matter if they're single or married, as long as it's not to each other. \n\nIf they are a couple, their marriage needs to be recognized by the church, and that means a Catholic blessed marriage - to achieve this, more intense preparation is necessary, and more requirements need to be met. \n\nSo, \"discussing their living situation\" is an euphemism to get them to marry through the church before the child's baptism, which can become an insanely demanding process for OP: four holy sacraments in a row, in a short period of time.", "\"...you might have to consider going Catholic\": No no no DON'T DO IT! This is a power play on Stephanie's part. If OP gives in, it will set the tone of all their interactions for the next 20 years. Just Say No.", "Kate isn't a practicing Catholic. She can't be as she's ignoring church teaching to live with OP. She might go to church but should go to confession before receiving communion as she's living in mortal sin.", "Godparents are the ones responsible for *religious* instruction. Guardians are the ones who'd care for the children.", "Sure, but she wants **fake** godparents (not members of the religion), so obviously the religious aspect isn't that big a deal to her.", "How can you be a godparent *in name* if you aren't part of the religion? It's a specifically religious role.", "Because if they're doing a full baptism and naming him godfather, the priest will want to see his Confirmation certificate. \n\nI have a lot of thoughts and opinions on this whole mess, but similar to points others have made, Kate's delusional if she thinks he can convert before the christening (which is probably within a few weeks or months). As someone else said, Easter is in a few weeks, and that's when the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) year \"ends\" and the adults are baptized and confirmed. Absolutely no church is going to accept him into this year's program. He'd be lucky to finish it by Easter 2024.", "Whoops, I just said basically the same thing in a different thread.", "Think about it from a different angle: she wants her sister to \"stop living in sin\".\n\nThe upcoming baptism (and the preparation sessions) must have awakened in Stephanie a stronger desire to be part of the community, and now she sees OP under a different light (probably like a lost sheep).", "It's wild to me how many people are saying that only one godparent has to be Catholic \u2014 I was born and raised Catholic and still attend (sporadically) the same church I grew up in, and I have never heard that. Both godparents are always Catholic. \n\nWhat's striking me is how many people are saying they're a godparent because their spouse is, which, to my understanding, is also not how it's done. It's not a package deal. For example, my godmother is my mother's sister but my godfather is my dad's brother (each of whom is married to someone else). So I'm curious: was your wife also asked to be godmother even though she isn't Catholic, or was it just you got asked and she went along?\n\n(I hope I'm not coming across disbelieving or antagonistic, I'm genuinely fascinated by the regional differences this post is bringing out \u2014 especially how my experience seems to be the odd one out.)", "And this is the worst possible time of the year to start\u2014Easter Vigil is only weeks away, which means OP would have to wait over a year to even be eligible.", "My mother(single and not Catholic) is the godmother of a Catholic child.\n\nShe has no connections to the church.", "The Catholic Church that I attended from birth until I left the religion almost didn\u2019t baptize me there because my older sister who died at 3 weeks old wasn\u2019t baptized at the church. She was given her final rites by an hospital priest. Even though that is where my parents held her funeral. \n\nI didn\u2019t find about about this until shortly before I got married in my mid 20\u2019s. It solidified that I would never be active in the Church again", "If ignoring church teaching precluded people from considering themselves practicing Catholic there\u2019d be a bunch more empty pews on Sunday.", "Sometimes it\u2019s both, no? I was raised catholic and have two of my aunts as godparents but they were both supposed to be my guardians if anything happened as well. Thankfully nothing did lol", "I don't think it makes a big difference whether you were born into the religion or not. Participating in the religious ceremonies often includes giving affirmations of your faith, so you end up pretending anyway. I am an atheist, I was baptized orthodox as a baby, I have in many occasions said things that I do not believe in because they are part of the traditions (my favourite being when I had to denounce satan with a prayer when I became a godmother). If I were religious I would feel that it is a mockery and a sacrilege, but since I am not, it is just a kooky part of my traditions.\n\nI think that's also the reason why the sister in law doesn't care about OP pretending, because she herself isn't religious so to her it is not \"a sin\", it's just a technicality to get over with, so they can do the religious ceremony.\n\nI wouldn't go through the process of converting either though, it's too much trouble when OPs wife can be the godmother at the ceremony and then both of them can act as godparents for all the stuff that comes after the baptism...", "Yeah I can see that, but I think if that was her view, then she should show the conviction of her beliefs, put her big girl pants on and have a honest conversation with her sister about it, rather than use her child as emotional blackmail leverage", "There's being an unofficial godparent, and being an official Church-approved godparent, rituals and all. Stephanie is asking OP to be the latter, which involves being officially Catholic. Not sure about your mom's situation but lots of people name \"godparents\" without going through the associated rituals. Stephanie wants to go by the book.", "I'm sure she considers herself a practicing Catholic; she ignores church teaching so she really isn't.", "A quick question, u/Squigglepig52: are you Portuguese?
