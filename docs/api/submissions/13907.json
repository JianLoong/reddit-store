If you're still unsure, you could ask him if that's what he wants.", "Does he want you to tell her? Or would he rather not?\n\nAnyway, NTA. She doesn\u2019t care about him otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have lied to you about him or cut him off. Sounds like she would make it all about herself anyway.

It took my dad and 2 grandparents and is after my mom, but she is still fighting.\n\nNTA.\n\nTell your sisters, but don't initiate contact with your mom if she is that toxic. This is obviously going to cause a fight if you do, and you are happier and healthier mentally the less contact you have with her.", "NTA. She hasn't done anything to indicate that she would respond well, and it won't give you the closure you're looking for. I guarantee she'll respond poorly and make this whole situation worse for you. Based on ages and other details in your post, I'm assuming that your sisters are not your father's kids, so you're not obligated to tell them either.\n\nUnless you are ready to return to a relationship with your mother (and it will be the same relationship left), you're better off staying NC.", "NTA, don\u2019t tell her, she will intrude into the last moments you do have with him. Tell her after he passes.", "NTA.\n\nYou have zero obligation to tell her.", "NTA, and you would be if you told her even if she hadn\u2019t lied. As a ED doctor this is something I\u2019ve become extremely passionate about. It\u2019s not your place to tell unless your dad specifically asked you to. He gets to decide who knows about his medical status, not anybody else. I\u2019d she gives you grief later about it firmly tell her it wasn\u2019t your place to say, because it isn\u2019t.", "NTA nothing good will come out of it. And either way you would feel pain and loss but im willing to bet that she will hurt you more with actions and words ranging how its god punishment to karma or the best way not showing any reaction any situation would hurt you more", "NTA if she is this mean and toxic then don\u2019t tell her shit", "NTA.  It's none of her business.  Her actions over the years speak to her character and that character is severely lacking love, kindness, compassion, honesty...  She deserves nothing and I doubt she would care anyway.", "NTA.\n\nWhether she would want to know or not is irrelevant.   They are divorced.  She cut him off completely and showed no interest in maintaining even a distant cordial relationship.   She has no right to know anything about his situation, and unless he has asked that you tell her, the appropriate thing to do is respect his medical privacy and not share his information.\n\nAs far as your sisters go--it's one thing to talk to a trusted confidant about what you and your family are going through, or to tell them if he was their father so they would maybe have an opportunity for closure, but it doesn't sound as if you are close to either of them, and he's not their father, so you shouldn't be telling them either.", "NTA - I wouldn't tell her, because you need something all of your own. You need experiences that she has no access to, relationships that she doesn't even know about. You need secrets of your own.

Who knows what your mother might do.", "Nta. No good would come of involving her.", "First off, I'm sending you a truckload of good vibes, because this situation sounds more complicated than a tangled ball of yarn. \n\nYou, dear poster, are NOT the asshole. You've gone through a lot and reconnected with your biological dad under incredibly difficult circumstances. Your mom, on the other hand, has a history of deceit and has caused you emotional pain.\n\nThe decision to inform her about your dad's condition ultimately rests on you. However, you don't owe her any information, given the strained relationship and her past actions. If you feel that telling her might bring some closure or relief, then go for it. But if it's only going to cause more distress, you have every right to prioritize your well-being and keep the information to yourself.\n\nFocus on healing and connecting with your bio dad in the time you have left together. Your well-being comes first. Stay strong, and remember: you've got this!", "NTA. It is tricky because I feel she does sort of have a right to know, but you went no contact for a reason, and neither you nor your dads family would really want her intruding on your dads final moments. Don\u2019t tell her.", "NTA she might have a right to know, but your father has a much more important right to a peaceful end to his life. She might try to contact him or just try to alienate family members, whatever she can think of. Not worth the risk.", "Nta\n\nShe doesn't cared for many years, why should she now?\nI don't think you would get anything from it, maybe a stupid answer.\n\nIt's up to your dad, to decide if he want to inform her. Your siblings though? Same dad, I would tell them.\n\nSo ask him, what he wants to.", "NTA.  You are NC with your mother for a reason.  She moved you across the country and kept you from that side of the family. I wouldn't share information about that side of the family with her at this point.", "NTA, she will surely make this about herself and somehow hurt you with this information.", "Don't tell her", "NTA. It hasn't matter to her all these years what comes off him so why would she need to know his status or condition now? He's your dad and he has no connection to anyone but you, so why does she need to know? I wouldn't say anything either. I'm sorry for your situation, condolences for the gravity of it all. Enjoy all the remaining time you have left with him and congrats on reconnecting with the other side of your family.", "NTA - she removed him from your lives unilaterally years ago, so she lost all rights to that relationship. She excluded that entire family from your lives, so she doesn\u2019t need to be included now. I guarantee if you do tell her, she will react with (A) anger that you contacted him and (B) selfishness, making the loss about her and not you. \n\nSorry for your imminent loss - and for the loss of so many years of your dad\u2019s life.", "Shes on a need to know basis and she clearly has shown she doesn't need to know so NTA.", "My heart goes out to you OP. You're NTA. Do what you need to do right now for yourself and your dad's time together. Your mom brought this on herself, alas.", "NTA. You missed years of a relationship with your father because of her selfishness.  Don't tell her.", "NTA\n\nI don't see you having any moral obligation to share any information about her abandoned ex-husband. Nor do your sisters have an obligation to not tell her. What she does or does not know need not concern you.\n\nI'm very sorry for your circumstances. Move forward as you feel comfortable. Allow that your dad's immediate family may be stand-offish. This is a lot. All three of your dad's kids are of an age range that struggling with big emotions is common.\n\nIf the extended family opens its' arms to you, keep your eyes open and step in as far as you feel good about. \n\nBeing NC with your mom seems a healthy choice. Neither dad's life nor passing is any of her business.\n\nLive long and prosper. May you find peace with the family of your heart.", "NTA.", "YWNBTA \n\nTelling her would stress you out and add stress to your dad's family if she chose to contact and harass them. There is no need for her to know considering how she chose to behave for many years.", "NTA.  You're under no obligation to tell anyone anything.  Your two sisters on your dad's side may benefit from getting to know you, though.", "NTA. I would say the MAIN person who gets to decide this is your Bio Dad, because essentially it's HIS news, his medical information and not yours to share. (Just as you don't announce someone else's pregnancy, etc.) If he gives his permission *you should do what's best for YOU, what you can live with in your own headspace.*  IMO: Essentially, your Mother has no 'rights' to any of her Ex's personal information, she lost that connection in the divorce and cemented it with all the ugliness that she committed afterwards. But no one would blame you if you felt the need to take the Moral High Ground and inform her either. I don't see a wrong decision either way. You've been through a lot, and it's still not fully calmed down, so just take care of YOU right now.", "Don't tell her.  It'll just open a can of worms.  Just keep this to yourself, maybe tell your sisters, but your mom doesn't care.  She just doesn't.  Yeah she'll probably be mad if she finds out, but she'll be mad that you found your dad, not that he's dying. She took you & hid you from your father FFS.  I don't say don't tell her to get even, I say it bc she really has no business knowing this information.", "I haven\u2019t asked, he is currently is hospice so I didn\u2019t want to add extra stress to him or his family - thank you for saying what you did though. His time is short and I\u2019m glad I got to meet him and get some closure.", "Thank you for that. It's wild that he had no symptoms until he did, then it's stage 4 with a \"get your affairs in order\" from the doctor. It's scary as hell. I appreciate the perspective since you're right, all telling her would do is bring stress where it's not needed.", " Enjoy all the remaining time you have left with him and congrats on reconnecting with the other side of your family.", "Thank you for that. I don\u2019t intend on resuming a relationship with her so I\u2019m not going to let her have the power to ruin the small time we have left.", "She has no right to know whatsoever. The only people who have a right to know are the people OP\u2019s dad want to know. If he wants his ex to know, he\u2019ll find a way to get that info to her himself.", "No hate. I'm just really curious why you think she has a right to know?", "I disagree. OP had a right to know her dad's side of the family wanted her and to be in contact with her. Mom doesn't have the right to know anything about dad's life after her because she forfeited that by her own actions.", "I keep seeing this. Why would she have a right to know? No hate I just can't think of a reason?", "I was estranged from my father for most of my life because of my mother's decisions. He came back in my life about 16 years ago. He had a cancer diagnosis last year. I did not tell my mother anything about it, my relationship with him has nothing to do with her. Thankfully, my father is doing alright. \nI don't think you should tell your mother anything, she is why he is just now in your life and you have so little time with him. You should focus on your time with him while you can, she will still be around (and likely as toxic) if you ever decide you want contact with her.", "That\u2019s how it was for my mom too. I\u2019m sorry, NTA \u2665\ufe0f", "I see what you mean, especially after the way she treated all of you. I guess it's kind of a general \"closing the circle\" thing - they were important to each other at one time. I do think the years (and events) since then have made that a non-issue."]}
