I really did not had a problem with any of this because I really didn't care about changing her opinion about me.\n\nA couple months ago we were at a party and she started commenting about a politics topic that was going on at the time at my country, she was being completely racist to the point where she said: \"I rather sorround myself with just white people instead of cholos\" (cholos is a really despective way of calling someone from rural areas here) and I really couldn't keep my mouth shut and told her that no one in our country was entirely white, not even her. My family on my dad's side is from the far rural areas from my country so I was infuriated by this. Her comment really shocked me and my bf, because Naruto identifies as someone who hates white supremacists.\n\nSo back to the BD thing, I'm inviting my friends, my family and some plus ones but I told Naruto that wasn't inviting his gf because of space and a tight budget, he told me that he would pay for her as he wants her to come and I ended up telling him that I wasn't having someone racist at my house.  I don't feel comfortable with having someone that doesn't appreciate me at MY birthday and someone that thinks she's better than someone else because of their skin color. My bf even told Naruto that he really didn't know why would he want her to come if we all know she does not like me, Naruto tried convincing us by telling that she might change in the future but I don't think my BD is a place for her to learn, that's her responsibility not ours. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679742621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121ilqh/aita_for_being_honest_about_why_i_dont_want/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys could talk to him about the situation, as if he really thinks she can change he\u2019s just lying to himself. Setting this boundary is good, but your bf might lose a friend down the line.

Or Naruto has to make a decision. It\u2019s such a shame since you guys are all so close, but until or unless he breaks up with her, he\u2019s going to want her to be involved in all of your plans."]}
