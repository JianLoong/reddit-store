We live in the same town as in laws and my parents and since moving here we've been constantly ambushed by people coming over without previous notice.

This works for one afternoon or two.\n Well for my birthday, I asked that we have no one over, no birthday or anything. I wanted to spend the day with my hubs and our kid, just a chill thing between us. My hubs loved the idea because he's sick of seeing our parents and his sister. The day before my bday, I get a call from MIL asking something about \"the party\" and I very nicely reminded her that it wasn't happening and she scoffed and said \"oh yeah, sure!\". Well they showed up anyways :))))). I was livid and basically made it known I was upset and made them promptly leave. They are livid, super angry for a while but this past weekend they attempted to come over again! After I had told them they weren't allowed over because hubs and I were going to be away for the weekend. They called asking what time they should come by and my husband told them we were not going to be home nor did we even know about this get together and to please stop the bs. \nNow they are over the moon angry, my mother in law and sister and law, and they believe me to be a monster cunt who is keeping their precious boys from them. \nAm I the asshole for sending them and their food party home on multiple occasions?\n\n:(", "created_utc": 1698241892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g5b97/aita_for_not_allowing_my_in_laws_over/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
