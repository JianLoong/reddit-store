We called the company to find out what was going on, and it turns out that the oil was meant for our neighbors and they accidentally put it in our tank instead. \n\nThey wanted to come suck it back out of the tank, but in order to do that, they would have needed to be able to enter my house (they can pump oil IN from a valve outside, but not suck it out). Both my wife and I are active in theatre plus working full time, so we are basically never home during business hours or even reasonable evening hours. We told them this, and offered a few (admittedly relatively unreasonable) times that we would be home and willing to let them in. \n\nThe times we offered didn\u2019t work for them. They asked if we would be willing to leave the house unlocked so they could come retrieve the oil while we were at work. Um, absolutely not?!? So, they offered to sell it to us. Now, my wife and I do ok for ourselves but still just barely live paycheck to paycheck, so I wasn\u2019t about to spend $400 for oil I didn\u2019t order and didn\u2019t need at the time. I told them that I\u2019d be willing to pay but only at a VERY steep discount, because this situation was in no way my fault. After that, we never heard back from them. \n\nFast forward to today, when we get a bill in the mail from them for full price. I have no intention of paying the bill to cover their mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit for some info: \n\nyes, we did actually receive the oil, and started burning it last month. Can\u2019t confirm how much they delivered, however, because my gauge is old and not that accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a paper trail - my wife did most of the communicating with them over the phone in March. We\u2019re checking now to see if we have any emails or other paper docs from them. We probably have the receipt they left on the door in the spring tucked away somewhere. \n\nThe times we offered them were after 8pm on weekdays. That is around the time we\u2019d have been getting home from rehearsals. We were involved in 2 shows each at that time, so we were BUSY. If they had gotten back with us over the summer we might have been able to offer more reasonable times. However, their response to our proposed times was that they wouldn\u2019t come after 4pm, so even in the summer we probably would have had to use PTO to make the arrangements, which I am not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1670590923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgws4j/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_heating_oil_i_didnt/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the same time, you admit you're now using the oil and I'm assuming you would have had to buy oil from your regular supplier before heating season. So not paying them at the time is reasonable, not changing your schedule is reasonable, but now using that oil and unjustly profiting due to their mistake? That doesn't seem right. I could understand calling them back now and saying \"I'd like a discount\" perhaps a bit less than what you'd normally pay.

That makes no sense.", "That's ... just not correct. If that was the case they could happily go all over the town, fill up tanks, claim it was a mistake and collect the money.\n\nThis is also a reason why there's a federal law in US that anything **unsolicited by you** you receive in post is **yours to keep, no strings or arguing attached**.\n\nThere are laws around the fast one the company is trying to pull too, but they will depend on the state, bylaws of the city, etc. Either way company is shit out of luck - there is no contract and they pumped their oil in a random hole somewhere. Is there even proof that it was OPs tank? Some other company might have, by coincidence, filled it by mistake at the same time, you know.\n\nEdit: And of course given OPs unreliable gage the tank might have been fuller than he thought from the start of it anyways ...", "The neighbor pre-paid for the order (hence why we originally only received a receipt, not a bill). The oil company then came back and did deliver their oil (which we saw on our Ring Doorbell). \n\nWe originally offered to pay for it a discount. Then we got ghosted. We\u2019ve been burning the oil for a month, so then collecting it now isn\u2019t possible. They\u2019re going to *have* to accept it as a loss, the way I see it.

I never agreed to pay this company anything, and would rather my money went to the company to which I am loyal\u2026 they had 9 months to contact us to try to get the oil back.

You said yourself you started burning it already. If you didn't buy oil from this company, you would have to buy it from somewhere else.
