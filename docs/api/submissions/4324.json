We called the company to find out what was going on, and it turns out that the oil was meant for our neighbors and they accidentally put it in our tank instead. \n\nThey wanted to come suck it back out of the tank, but in order to do that, they would have needed to be able to enter my house (they can pump oil IN from a valve outside, but not suck it out). Both my wife and I are active in theatre plus working full time, so we are basically never home during business hours or even reasonable evening hours. We told them this, and offered a few (admittedly relatively unreasonable) times that we would be home and willing to let them in. \n\nThe times we offered didn\u2019t work for them. They asked if we would be willing to leave the house unlocked so they could come retrieve the oil while we were at work. Um, absolutely not?!? So, they offered to sell it to us. Now, my wife and I do ok for ourselves but still just barely live paycheck to paycheck, so I wasn\u2019t about to spend $400 for oil I didn\u2019t order and didn\u2019t need at the time. I told them that I\u2019d be willing to pay but only at a VERY steep discount, because this situation was in no way my fault. After that, we never heard back from them. \n\nFast forward to today, when we get a bill in the mail from them for full price. I have no intention of paying the bill to cover their mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit for some info: \n\nyes, we did actually receive the oil, and started burning it last month. Can\u2019t confirm how much they delivered, however, because my gauge is old and not that accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a paper trail - my wife did most of the communicating with them over the phone in March. We\u2019re checking now to see if we have any emails or other paper docs from them. We probably have the receipt they left on the door in the spring tucked away somewhere. \n\nThe times we offered them were after 8pm on weekdays. That is around the time we\u2019d have been getting home from rehearsals. We were involved in 2 shows each at that time, so we were BUSY. If they had gotten back with us over the summer we might have been able to offer more reasonable times. However, their response to our proposed times was that they wouldn\u2019t come after 4pm, so even in the summer we probably would have had to use PTO to make the arrangements, which I am not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1670590923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgws4j/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_heating_oil_i_didnt/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t THINK it\u2019s a scam, we did actually get more oil (though the gauge isn\u2019t super accurate so I can\u2019t confirm how much), and they did come out to redeliver oil to the neighbors (which we saw on our Ring Doorbell).", "This is what I\u2019m inclined to do.

No one prolly wants to work in unreasonable times. And you don't wanna leave your door open. So what now. \n\nThey aren't gonna give it you for free. It's still they're labor.

I understand not going out of your way for them to come do the pump out. At the same time, you admit you're now using the oil and I'm assuming you would have had to buy oil from your regular supplier before heating season. So not paying them at the time is reasonable, not changing your schedule is reasonable, but now using that oil and unjustly profiting due to their mistake? That doesn't seem right. I could understand calling them back now and saying \"I'd like a discount\" perhaps a bit less than what you'd normally pay. But asking for a steep discount for something you'd be buying anyway at this time of the year seems kind of disingenuous.", "Right!

That makes no sense.", "That's ... just not correct. If that was the case they could happily go all over the town, fill up tanks, claim it was a mistake and collect the money.\n\nThis is also a reason why there's a federal law in US that anything **unsolicited by you** you receive in post is **yours to keep, no strings or arguing attached**.\n\nThere are laws around the fast one the company is trying to pull too, but they will depend on the state, bylaws of the city, etc. Either way company is shit out of luck - there is no contract and they pumped their oil in a random hole somewhere. Is there even proof that it was OPs tank? Some other company might have, by coincidence, filled it by mistake at the same time, you know.", "The neighbor pre-paid for the order (hence why we originally only received a receipt, not a bill). The oil company then came back and did deliver their oil (which we saw on our Ring Doorbell). \n\nWe originally offered to pay for it a discount. Then we got ghosted. We\u2019ve been burning the oil for a month, so then collecting it now isn\u2019t possible. They\u2019re going to *have* to accept it as a loss, the way I see it. Im not paying without a court order to do so\u2026 I don\u2019t see how I have any obligation to do anything more than I already did, tbh.", "I feel like as the consumer, I should have the right to choose where my money gets spent. I never agreed to pay this company anything, and would rather my money went to the company to which I am loyal\u2026 they had 9 months to contact us to try to get the oil back. Instead, they waited until a month after the cold season starts and just hit us with a bill? That sounds pretty disingenuous to me.", "The neighbours aren't the company is.\n\nThe neighbours haven't received what they ordered so have no responsibility to pay.\n\nOp didn't order this so has no responsibility to pay.\n\nThe company fucked up big time by mixing the properties up and is lucky all that's happened is they're out $400.", "It could be unjust enrichment, but I think It isnt because It os necessary a contract\nUnjust enrichment would be they had the contract for the oil, the Company put It into the tank and Op Didnt pay for It, that Didnt happend, but im not a lawyer s\u00f3 idk", "> They should consult with a local attorney.\n\nOn a $400 invoice?

It got cold, and they never came to get it back.", "You are correct in your sample scenario but wrong on this one. The error was the Oil Co.'s error. The OP gave them the times they were available and the Oil Co declined, thus abandoning their product. AS it was not OP fault that the oil ended up in their tank, they are not required to take time out of their work for the oil company's error. They waited a reasonable amount of time for the Oil Co to come take the oil at a time that was convenient to them. At this point, due to the amount of time that has passed, they are no longer under any legal obligation.", "I'm not saying you shouldn't use the oil. All I'm saying is that the company is billing you for a reason and you should be prepared that they will try to collect on it.  Whether you choose to try to negotiate something now or wait for legal action later is up to you."]}
