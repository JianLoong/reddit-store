{"id": 4324, "submission_id": "zgws4j", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for heating oil I didn\u2019t order?", "selftext": "Don\u2019t know if this really qualifies as \u201casshole\u201d since it\u2019s dealing with a company but wasn\u2019t sure where else to post\u2026 \n\nSo here\u2019s the story - in March of this year, we found a receipt attached to my door for $400ish worth of heating oil from a company that I\u2019ve never used. We called the company to find out what was going on, and it turns out that the oil was meant for our neighbors and they accidentally put it in our tank instead. \n\nThey wanted to come suck it back out of the tank, but in order to do that, they would have needed to be able to enter my house (they can pump oil IN from a valve outside, but not suck it out). Both my wife and I are active in theatre plus working full time, so we are basically never home during business hours or even reasonable evening hours. We told them this, and offered a few (admittedly relatively unreasonable) times that we would be home and willing to let them in. \n\nThe times we offered didn\u2019t work for them. They asked if we would be willing to leave the house unlocked so they could come retrieve the oil while we were at work. Um, absolutely not?!? So, they offered to sell it to us. Now, my wife and I do ok for ourselves but still just barely live paycheck to paycheck, so I wasn\u2019t about to spend $400 for oil I didn\u2019t order and didn\u2019t need at the time. I told them that I\u2019d be willing to pay but only at a VERY steep discount, because this situation was in no way my fault. After that, we never heard back from them. \n\nFast forward to today, when we get a bill in the mail from them for full price. I have no intention of paying the bill to cover their mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit for some info: \n\nyes, we did actually receive the oil, and started burning it last month. Can\u2019t confirm how much they delivered, however, because my gauge is old and not that accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a paper trail - my wife did most of the communicating with them over the phone in March. We\u2019re checking now to see if we have any emails or other paper docs from them. We probably have the receipt they left on the door in the spring tucked away somewhere. \n\nThe times we offered them were after 8pm on weekdays. That is around the time we\u2019d have been getting home from rehearsals. We were involved in 2 shows each at that time, so we were BUSY. If they had gotten back with us over the summer we might have been able to offer more reasonable times. However, their response to our proposed times was that they wouldn\u2019t come after 4pm, so even in the summer we probably would have had to use PTO to make the arrangements, which I am not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1670590923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgws4j/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_heating_oil_i_didnt/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They fucked up and they should be willing to accommodate their schedule to yours, if they want their oil back so bad.\n\nNTA - you keep that shit for free or they work with you and your wife to get it back on your time.", "NTA and DO NOT pay them. You never contracted with them so you are not responsible for that bill. They have no leg to stand on. They're shit out of luck.", "NTA.\nContact whichever agency is your consumer watchdog to find out your rights.", "NTA\n\nTheir mistake.  You offered a remedy, they refused.  Keep the oil. Advise them you did not place the order, have no liability.  If they send a bill or turn it over to collections, hire an attorney and file suit against them for damages.", "NTA. They messed up and there's no contract between you and their company so not much they can do", "NTA\n\nYes, you can be the AH when dealing with a company. You aren't at fault here. If they want to get the oil they put there, they need to schedule it when you are available. A compromise where they pay for your time and you take a break to give them access might be possible, but their mistake shouldn't cost you anything. \n\nKeep good records. This might get legal.", "their fuck up not yours, NTA", "NTA, keep all correspondence as this might go legal (although for that amount it might not be worth it)\n\nIf you would need to buy the heating oil anyways you might consider trying to legally buy it (with indeed a discount! At least 25% maybe 50?) And see it as savings for the future\n\nOh and small INFO: Can you see that there is more oil in your tank? It might even just be a scam...", "Hmmm, NTA. \n\nDepends on what the unreasonable hours you offered are though. I'd say if you offered times between 8am - 10pm then that's ok. \n\nBut then again... it is their mistake. What would they have done if the house was inoccupied and you lived abroad? It's their mistake at the end of the day to swallow, and you did offer to pay even if it was at a steep discount.", "NTA - they messed up. I wouldn\u2019t have even entertained the idea of a company I didn\u2019t hire coming into my home to retrieve the oil so you\u2019re a better person than I am. You tried to work with them, they refused, not your problem. \n\nKeep every communication you\u2019ve had with them. Respond via certified letter when you send the bill back to them saying that you never contracted their services, they made a mistake, and wouldn\u2019t work with you to correct their mistake and have no obligation to pay or continue further with their business. They may try to turn it over to connection or sue but like most businesses if they make a mistake like that, they get to eat it.", "NTA.  Clearly their mistake.\n\nContact your local BBB and state attorney's consumer protection office for help.  Clarify state laws about retailers/contractors illegally forcing sales on unwilling participants.\n\nCheck with your neighbor if this oil was indeed ordered, because this could be a scam.  Can you check the oil gauge?  Do you even remember what the last reading was?\n\nMaybe:\n\nFile a police report on the company saying you think this could be a scam, or at the very least trespassing and \"polluting\" your tank with oil you did not request from a company you do not trust, ASSUMING that the said company put oil in there in the first place.  Again check your gauge.\n\nAsk the company for their insurance and tell the company you are filing a claim against them.\n\nOr the company can file a claim against itself for it's own worker's mistake.", "NTA. They made a mistake with their product and you never made any sort of contract agreement with them so you're not liable for their mistake and you don't have to let them in your home.", "NTA they are out of luck. You have no contract with them. They effectively poured that oil down the drain (or tank). DO NOT pay, and I\u2019d not even return their calls. This is on them and they likely know it.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure there is a law that protects you here. They made the mistake it\u2019s their loss, you\u2019ve tried to organise a time for them to take it back and they can\u2019t do it so you shouldn\u2019t have to pay at all", "You need legal advice\n\nNTA", "We had this happen several years ago when we first bought our home.\n\nApparently the previous owners had auto delivery set up and forgot to cancel it. \n\nWe declined to pay and also declined access to our home, and pumping pull back out does carry a risk of damage to your system. Told them to take it up with the previous owners whom had contracted with them. \n\nPrevious owners refused to pay and sent to company back to us. We basically said, not our problem, we are not your customer. Bills came for a while, we ignored \n\nEventually they stopped trying to collect. I don't know if it's because the previous owners finally paid for the oil that they technically ordered, or if the company gave up.", "NTA\nIf you have a letter/email of them agreeing to their mistake then you don't have to pay. \n\nOther thing you could do is workout a payment plan (if you're going to use to oil) $35 per month over a year", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They made a mistake and weren't able to come up with a reasonable compromise, you have not contract or agreement with them. Like what were they going to do if you wre out of town for the holidays?", "You might want to check on r/legaladvice about this. You definitely shouldn't have to do extra legwork to correct their mistake but straight up keeping the oil might be a crime. From what I've seen this could potentially be unjust enrichment, but I'm not a lawyer and I'm sure that varies everywhere.", "NTA\n\nThe smartest move by the company would have been to offer to sell it to you at a deep discount and move on.", "Yta. It was an honest mistake and you are being purposely difficult", "YTA for not working with the company.  It was this bit \"(admittedly relatively unreasonable) times\" that turned me from a soft NTA.  People make mistakes and they don't come across as asking for a timing that is too outrageous.  Keeping the house unlocked was a no goer for sure, although was there a friend or relative that could have been available for the company to come round in business hours.", "I came to say exactly the same thing.

What damages does OP have?", "Unfortunately, most of the communication in March was verbal over the phone. They probably have the records but we certainly don\u2019t. Any further communication will definitely be documented. \n\nAt the time, we offered to buy it at around 50% cost, and they declines. I think they had offered us like 2c off per gallon. We declined, counteroffered, and never heard back.\n\nEdit for INFO: yes, we definitely did receive the oil, and started burning it last month.", "I think we offered after 8pm on weekdays, which is after we would be home from rehearsals.

Don\u2019t discuss anything over the phone. Get it all in writing.", "Unfortunately, most of our previous communication was verbal over the phone, which was absolutely our mistake. Any future correspondence will be documented in writing. \n\nBut yeah, my wife was saying she feels like we\u2019re being punished for being good people - we didn\u2019t have to call and report the mistake to them at all, but we did.", "Thanks for the advice. The terminology you used will be helpful for my research. I don\u2019t THINK it\u2019s a scam, we did actually get more oil (though the gauge isn\u2019t super accurate so I can\u2019t confirm how much), and they did come out to redeliver oil to the neighbors (which we saw on our Ring Doorbell).", "This is what I\u2019m inclined to do. I don\u2019t feel like arguing anymore. They ghosted us in the spring, it was closed in my mind. I don\u2019t have any intention of communicating with them unless they really force it, and then it will only be in writing.", "Thanks for sharing! I\u2019m inclined to just ignore it too unless they really push the issue.

Who is responsible if there is an oil mess left in the house?", "I think we offered after 8pm on weekdays, which is when we would be getting back from rehearsals. My wife just reminded me that their response to that was \u201cwe won\u2019t come out after 4pm\u201d. We both work full time, as do our trusted friends and family. I\u2019m not wasting a vacation day to help a company fix their mistake\u2026", "If the oil company pushes further with their bill (i.e. sell it to a collection agency), and this hits their credit, they have been damaged.  Their reputation would be damaged.", "Damage to his credit if they take it to collections for one. His time spent dealing with this. Damages don't have to be physical.", "It's either lose all the $400 or take it over 12 months or 10 months. They're likely to offer an upfront discount instead to close the case", "To quote you \u201c we offered a few admittedly relatively unreasonable times that we could be home.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like you where really giving a good faith effort. I understand this isn\u2019t your fault but unless you have never made a mistake I would be a little more accommodating.", "Yeah both valid points. These companies are notorious for giving 4-6 hour windows of when the truck might arrive. And, I\u2019ve heard from others that getting your tank pumped almost always leaves a mess, and the tank is in the same area that we keep our dogs during the day.", "You're right. I wasn't thinking. Thanks for explaining.", "I never said damages had to be physical. Just asking a question.", "If op has a letter or email of them admitting they messed up they can't force op to pay they were willing other times and even offered to pay at a lower price and they still just sent the whole bill so honestly they need to just lawyer up cause I feel this isn't gonna end well for that company they messed up big time.", "Oh yeah I agree with that and it's the first point I made. I'm just hoping OP has them agreeing to their mistake on mail"]}
