We called the company to find out what was going on, and it turns out that the oil was meant for our neighbors and they accidentally put it in our tank instead. \n\nThey wanted to come suck it back out of the tank, but in order to do that, they would have needed to be able to enter my house (they can pump oil IN from a valve outside, but not suck it out). Both my wife and I are active in theatre plus working full time, so we are basically never home during business hours or even reasonable evening hours. We told them this, and offered a few (admittedly relatively unreasonable) times that we would be home and willing to let them in. \n\nThe times we offered didn\u2019t work for them. They asked if we would be willing to leave the house unlocked so they could come retrieve the oil while we were at work. Um, absolutely not?!? So, they offered to sell it to us. Now, my wife and I do ok for ourselves but still just barely live paycheck to paycheck, so I wasn\u2019t about to spend $400 for oil I didn\u2019t order and didn\u2019t need at the time. I told them that I\u2019d be willing to pay but only at a VERY steep discount, because this situation was in no way my fault. After that, we never heard back from them. \n\nFast forward to today, when we get a bill in the mail from them for full price. I have no intention of paying the bill to cover their mistake. AITA?\n\nEdit for some info: \n\nyes, we did actually receive the oil, and started burning it last month. Can\u2019t confirm how much they delivered, however, because my gauge is old and not that accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a paper trail - my wife did most of the communicating with them over the phone in March. We\u2019re checking now to see if we have any emails or other paper docs from them. We probably have the receipt they left on the door in the spring tucked away somewhere. \n\nThe times we offered them were after 8pm on weekdays. That is around the time we\u2019d have been getting home from rehearsals. We were involved in 2 shows each at that time, so we were BUSY. If they had gotten back with us over the summer we might have been able to offer more reasonable times. However, their response to our proposed times was that they wouldn\u2019t come after 4pm, so even in the summer we probably would have had to use PTO to make the arrangements, which I am not willing to do.", "created_utc": 1670590923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgws4j/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_heating_oil_i_didnt/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the same time, you admit you're now using the oil and I'm assuming you would have had to buy oil from your regular supplier before heating season. So not paying them at the time is reasonable, not changing your schedule is reasonable, but now using that oil and unjustly profiting due to their mistake? That doesn't seem right. I could understand calling them back now and saying \"I'd like a discount\" perhaps a bit less than what you'd normally pay.

That makes no sense.", "That's ... just not correct. If that was the case they could happily go all over the town, fill up tanks, claim it was a mistake and collect the money.\n\nThis is also a reason why there's a federal law in US that anything **unsolicited by you** you receive in post is **yours to keep, no strings or arguing attached**.\n\nThere are laws around the fast one the company is trying to pull too, but they will depend on the state, bylaws of the city, etc. Either way company is shit out of luck - there is no contract and they pumped their oil in a random hole somewhere. Is there even proof that it was OPs tank? Some other company might have, by coincidence, filled it by mistake at the same time, you know.\n\nEdit: And of course given OPs unreliable gage the tank might have been fuller than he thought from the start of it anyways ...", "The neighbor pre-paid for the order (hence why we originally only received a receipt, not a bill). The oil company then came back and did deliver their oil (which we saw on our Ring Doorbell). \n\nWe originally offered to pay for it a discount. Then we got ghosted. We\u2019ve been burning the oil for a month, so then collecting it now isn\u2019t possible. They\u2019re going to *have* to accept it as a loss, the way I see it.

I never agreed to pay this company anything, and would rather my money went to the company to which I am loyal\u2026 they had 9 months to contact us to try to get the oil back.

You said yourself you started burning it already. If you didn't buy oil from this company, you would have to buy it from somewhere else. This isn't like you ordered a bag of dog food but received bird seed instead, it's oil that you are now currently using.

Don\u2019t be surprised when they sue you and get a judgment for unjust enrichment.", "Reclaiming the oil won't solve anything: Ii is mixed up with the oil OP has in his tank, and thus they can not guarantee to the next buyer that it will be up to spec. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu don't just buy (sell) \"OIL ... you buy a specific product with a data sheet and guaranteed properties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there were some sludge from OP's tank pumped up ... any damage to the next customer would be the company's liability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey can not even pump it back into their tank, because that would mean emptying it, and cleaning it afterwards.", "Absolutely. They say that it was a mistake, but it could just as easily have been a deliberate attempt to pad their bottom line by \"accidentally\" filling up your tank and then sending you a bill. I'd call them up and tell them if you hear from them just one more time, you are going to report them to whatever government agency that is available to deal with shady business practices and then immediately do just that if they ever attempt to collect again.", "Its probably not worth it for the oil company to try but this is textbook unjust enrichment since he is burning the oil amd receiving a benefit.", "The state attorney's consumer protection office is a good suggestion, but please don't recommend people use the BBB. They're literally just like Yelp- if you pay them, they remove bad ratings. An absolute scam company that people think is legitimate or government-related (it's not). There are numerous news stories and reports you can find about them being shady.\n\nNot trying to be a dick- it just seems like a lot of people are not aware of that and think it's some official government organization.", "So if I fill your gas tank for you, I can charge you whatever I want without your consent?", "You\u2019re kidding, right? Let some unknown company into my house with my dogs for a day unaccompanied? In what world is THAT the answer?!?", "I think they just want to get them to pay and had no intention of actually retrieving it, assuming they make at least 20% profit on their oil deliveries it's really about $300 worth of oil, by the time they pay someone to show up with a tanker, get inside, pump it out, how much would they actually make reselling it", "There is NO proof that the oil really got delivered to OP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nANd OP offered them to come and take their Oil back. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP can rigthfully argue that he offered them different solutions, and the company failed to reclaim their oil as offered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANd: There would also need to be a discussion about the price, OP certainly wouldnd't want to pay the asked price, but research if the price was reasonably cheap compared to marekt.", "According to the Corrnell Law Institute this is not unjust enrichment: \n\n> There are two principles which help to refine the circumstances under which a plaintiff cannot bring an unjust enrichment claim:\n\n> The plaintiff cannot confer a benefit upon the defendant without giving the defendant the choice to reject the benefit, and then expect something in return from the defendant\n\n> ex: The plaintiff cannot paint the defendant's house in the middle of the night when defendant is sleeping, and then expect the defendant to pay the plaintiff for the plaintiff's efforts (assuming that the two parties had not contracted for this service to be performed at this time).", "I'm certain I wouldn't call this textbook unjust enrichment. There was no contract. OP didn't agree to pay, get the product, then choose not to pay. OP was given this product against their wishes. On top of that, OP gave the company the opportunity to come collect their product and remedy their mistake. The company declined to collect their product because it wasn't convenient to them.

The vendor made a mistake. You won\u2019t let them get it back.", "\"Come when I feel like it in the middle of the night\" is not everything, you could've taken a day off, let them come when you aren't at home, or ask someone to watch the house one afternoon. \n\n8pm+ is not a reasonable time, most likely this would mean them having to keep employees 4 hours+ past closing hours + the appropriate truck and equipment, and likely keeping the office and garage open all this time which could cost more than what the oil is worth.\n\nYou say you do that, but from any other perspective, it looks  like you're pulling a scam on them and then trying to get them to basically give it to you almost nothing.", "Except you could easily show that you made a reasonable effort to give it back and they did not take you on it, which OP has not. \"Come past 9pm at night\" is ridiculous.", "You should talk to a lawyer about this, because there's a thing called unjust enrichment. I dunno if your situation qualifies or if it would be worth it for the oil company to pursue it, and neither does anyone else here on Reddit, so you should go do a consult with a local attorney to make sure you are in the clear legally.", "My husband is a plumber and I guess where we live, that is completely reasonable and normal. Even with pets. But even when the cable guy or whoever needs you to be home for them to come, most people make it work. You are being unreasonable IMO.", "Unjust enrichment is actually typically only a viable claim where there is no contract. Thats why it exists.

How is it more acceptable for me to waste a day of vacation than it is for them to keep workers late to rectify their mistake? How could I possibly be scamming them when THEY are the ones who delivered the oil??", "It would be one thing if it was a company I had contracted and trusted. I know NOTHING about this company other than that they sell oil. Why should I trust them in my home?!?", "It will only go into collection if the company fraudulently claims that it is a real debt. And all OP would have to do is make the collection agency validate the debt, which without fraud they will not be able to do. The only way the debt can be valid if the company sues OP and company gets judgment against OP or OP accepts the debt.
