You need to list everyone who is part of your household in order to get insurance, and anyone who is part of your household and can drive is considered \u201crated.\u201d The policy takes them into account when calculating your premium, because insurers legally have to cover them unless they are contractually excluded from your policy. Excluding a household member is basically like signing a waiver with a guarantee that you will never allow that person to drive your car, and as a result your insurance will never pay for anything that happens if they drive your car. It\u2019s actually prohibited in some states. It creates a legal mess in the U.S., because it\u2019s illegal to drive uninsured (for many obvious policy reasons), and it\u2019s simpler to just have a single policy for a vehicle and owner that accounts for everything (and that is what the government wants to avoid complex claims).", "Not even that.

Brother broke into the home and stole the keys", "I totally agree, it is properly absurd. There is some logic behind it all, usually it goes back to holding SOMEONE responsible (financially) for damage that a victim suffers at no fault of their own. It would suck if you were an innocent person who got hit by a random 12 year old in a car and you could only sue the 12 year old kid. The kid obviously has no assets and no insurance coverage, so if the law didn\u2019t extend somewhere else you\u2019d be shit out of luck. So there are various theories of vicarious liability, which are derivative of the primary wrong, that try to account for those scenarios and hold someone else liable so plaintiffs don\u2019t end up with no recovery. This is also why I mentioned that here in the U.S. it\u2019s illegal to even own a car that isn\u2019t insured, unless you register it as a non-operational status vehicle. The government wants to force people to have liability coverage, and they also want to force insurance companies to cover all reasonable and foreseeable claims. And thus, almost all policies need to legally, at minimum, cover accidents that result from people who borrow your car (known as \u201cpermissive use\u201d coverage, again it is built into the policy through underwriting). It is more rare to have a minimum coverage plan that doesn\u2019t cover permissive use, and you will almost certainly not be covered (if you had such a policy) if someone borrows your car without your permission and then causes an accident (your insurance company would tell you to sue them). Unless there was literal car theft. And here OP could never succeed on that theory, so the problem here is the insurance policy likely just doesn\u2019t cover a stupid thing like you or someone with permission to use your car forgetting a chicken breast in your car.", "OP may frame it that way in a comment, but they\u2019ve already revealed \u201cI live close to both my folks and they both have keys to my house\u201d and they her dad said he \u201cborrowed [her] car, which he is allowed to do\u2026\u201d OP literally handed keys to her house to her dad and mom. You should know, by doing so, that your half brother/dad\u2019s son may also access the house under the same scope of permission. She may not have handed the keys, but she handed permission to her dad to use her car, and it sounds like there was an established pattern of consent/use. Nowhere here do I see a crime any prosecutor would pursue, let alone win if they brought the case. And car theft is a non-starter, because of a concept known as mens rea, under which a criminal needs to be proven to have had a certain guilty state of mind before they can be charged for a misdemeanor or felony. Car theft ALWAYS requires (1) an intent to take possession of a vehicle, (2) without permission, and (3) permanently deprive the owner of it. That\u2019s not only impossible to prove here, but actually the converse is proven beyond dispute. The alleged \u201cthief\u201d returned his loot. And by all appearances, he intended to do so from the start. Again, moral of the story is to be careful in who you entrust possession/entry of your property to. There are some scenarios that could have happened here where OP would be legally on the hook for something bad happening. \n\nAnd my comment you replied to is not about OP, it\u2019s a hypothetical to respond to another person\u2019s legal question.", "Just looked up the law in my state and it does not require intent to permanently keep said vehicle. It just requires taking of a vehicle that they were not given permission to take. The specific wording is to wrongfully obtain or exert unauthorized control over the property. Nowhere in any auto theft laws at least here require the permanent part. \nIf it isn\u2019t intent on reselling then this is what they are charged with. \nA person is guilty of taking a motor vehicle without permission in the second degree if he or she, without the permission of the owner or person entitled to possession, intentionally takes or drives away any automobile or motor vehicle, whether propelled by steam, electricity, or internal combustion engine, that is the property of another, or he or she voluntarily rides in or upon the automobile or motor vehicle with knowledge of the fact that the automobile or motor vehicle was unlawfully taken.\n(2) Taking a motor vehicle without permission in the second degree is a class C felony.", "I\u2019m curious what state you live in, but I can tell you from the wording of the statute you copied/pasted that the main elements that are problematic here are the two I identified. (1) First, \u201cintentionally takes or drives away.\u201d Usually \u201ctaking\u201d has a very specific meaning in criminal law, and that is where the intent to permanently deprive part comes in. It\u2019s very likely that case law in your state has established that if you take a car, but don\u2019t intend to keep it, you haven\u2019t \u201ctaken\u201d it for purposes of that felony statute. (2) The more intuitively easy argument here, based on that statute, is the other point I originally flagged. It says \u201cwithout permission of the owner or person entitled to possession\u2026\u201d Here the dad is a \u201cperson entitled to possession,\u201d as established above. Accordingly, unless the father testified that his son asked that if he could drive the car, and he said no, then that additional element wouldn\u2019t be met. Because you\u2019d need to prove that the dad didn\u2019t tell his son he could borrow it for a grocery run. Which is the most reasonable inference given all of the facts here. Also, in this case the dad would actually testify that he told his son he could take it, and he assumed his daughter would be OK with it since she also lets him drive her car to get groceries (with express permission). He wants to protect his son.", ">What was the story with the raw chicken breast? Why was it left it in the car?

My first day at sixth form, we discovered that a bunch of the previous year's leavers had decided to \"prank\" everyone by leaving fish in their lockers over the summer. The teacher and caretaking staff were furious; the whole building had to be aired out for days before the staff would let anyone in, and I think a bunch of furniture/furnishings had to be junked and replaced entirely. \n\nThis seems like the same kind of teenage edgelord behaviour to me.
