You need to list everyone who is part of your household in order to get insurance, and anyone who is part of your household and can drive is considered \u201crated.\u201d The policy takes them into account when calculating your premium, because insurers legally have to cover them unless they are contractually excluded from your policy. Excluding a household member is basically like signing a waiver with a guarantee that you will never allow that person to drive your car, and as a result your insurance will never pay for anything that happens if they drive your car. It\u2019s actually prohibited in some states. It creates a legal mess in the U.S., because it\u2019s illegal to drive uninsured (for many obvious policy reasons), and it\u2019s simpler to just have a single policy for a vehicle and owner that accounts for everything (and that is what the government wants to avoid complex claims).", "Not even that.
