So I will need to spend my Christmas Day resting & recovering - with my ONE DAY OFF\u201d\n\nThen have the conversation about HIS plans for Christmas Day with these \u201creminders\u201d in view. \n\nAlso take a photograph of them - preferably with him pointing to each one individually / doing a thumbs up, to acknowledge he has seen & understood each one. \n\nIf things haven\u2019t got too far with the frustration on this one (on either side), then this can be done in a playful & silly & fun way. \n\nIt\u2019s the kind of thing I would do for my partner - who often doesn\u2019t \u201chear\u201d things I say to him. (A combination of me tending to use 500 words when 5 would do, and him only hearing the first thought in a conversation & then starting to think about & respond to that, so nothing else goes in.)\n\nThe message you want to convey is: I am not trying to stop you having fun. I just want something that works for BOTH of us. I\u2019m confident you can suggest something that meets both of our needs. Let\u2019s just be really clear on what MY needs are, and then I\u2019ll let you get your creative thinking cap on. I believe that you love me & want me to be happy - so we just need to be clear on the ground rules (which are mostly around me being able to sleep & do nothing).", "Book a hotel room. \n\nTell hubby NOW that if he wants anyone over for any kind of special meal, he can plan, shop, prep, cook, serve and clean up after it. ALL hosting duties, from clean, empty kitchen to start through to return to the clean, empty kitchen at finish, are HIS.\n\nThen do as the other commenters here suggested. Turn your alarm off in the morning and sleep in until 10 or 11 am. Get up, sip wine, chat to his mother and watch him  do his thing in the kitchen. Ignore attempts to seek assistance from you. Don't even bother changing out of your pyjamas. Eat lunch, or dinner - whichever one the meal is. \n\nAnd then, most importantly, thank hubby and get up and walk out of the house. Get in your car and drive to the hotel, and take a nap.\n\nI suggest this because, out of all the parts of the hosting task, cleaning up is usually the one people are the most keen to fob off. I would expect him to start hinting to you before the meal is even served to move this dish into the kitchen, or wipe that over there, and other similar, small, cleanup commencement tasks. I absolutely think that even after you make it clear that he is hosting, he is going to expect you to help him clean it all up. \n\nSo, foil that plan by simply not being there. And, refuse to return until he has sent you a photo of your kitchen to prove that it has been returned to it's clean, empty starting state. \n\nMost importantly, pay close attention to how he responds to this. Fits, tantrums, fights, guilting and gaslighting? Insistence that you return home immediately to help clean up? If any of that happens, consider them red flags, and pay much closer attention to his behaviour over the next few months. You may need to reassess your relationship. I hope not, but from the description of his behaviour in your post, it is a real possibility that you have misjudged a few things.", "NTA\n\n\"treats me like a queen\"\n\nbut: \n\n\\- constantly forgets conversations\n\n\\- get mad\n\n\\- I\u2019m being treated as if I\u2019m being incredibly unfair\n\n\\- doesnt respect your boundaries and your free time", "NTA.\n\nYou're in retail.
