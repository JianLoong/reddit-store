(A combination of me tending to use 500 words when 5 would do, and him only hearing the first thought in a conversation & then starting to think about & respond to that, so nothing else goes in.)\n\nThe message you want to convey is: I am not trying to stop you having fun. I just want something that works for BOTH of us. I\u2019m confident you can suggest something that meets both of our needs. Let\u2019s just be really clear on what MY needs are, and then I\u2019ll let you get your creative thinking cap on. I believe that you love me & want me to be happy - so we just need to be clear on the ground rules (which are mostly around me being able to sleep & do nothing).", "Book a hotel room. \n\nTell hubby NOW that if he wants anyone over for any kind of special meal, he can plan, shop, prep, cook, serve and clean up after it. ALL hosting duties, from clean, empty kitchen to start through to return to the clean, empty kitchen at finish, are HIS.\n\nThen do as the other commenters here suggested. Turn your alarm off in the morning and sleep in until 10 or 11 am. Get up, sip wine, chat to his mother and watch him  do his thing in the kitchen. Ignore attempts to seek assistance from you. Don't even bother changing out of your pyjamas. Eat lunch, or dinner - whichever one the meal is. \n\nAnd then, most importantly, thank hubby and get up and walk out of the house. Get in your car and drive to the hotel, and take a nap.\n\nI suggest this because, out of all the parts of the hosting task, cleaning up is usually the one people are the most keen to fob off. I would expect him to start hinting to you before the meal is even served to move this dish into the kitchen, or wipe that over there, and other similar, small, cleanup commencement tasks. I absolutely think that even after you make it clear that he is hosting, he is going to expect you to help him clean it all up. \n\nSo, foil that plan by simply not being there. And, refuse to return until he has sent you a photo of your kitchen to prove that it has been returned to it's clean, empty starting state. \n\nMost importantly, pay close attention to how he responds to this. Fits, tantrums, fights, guilting and gaslighting? Insistence that you return home immediately to help clean up? If any of that happens, consider them red flags, and pay much closer attention to his behaviour over the next few months. You may need to reassess your relationship.

That's enough to make anyone want to hide under the bed and avoid all carbon based life forms for Christmas.", "I think the point is that even if he did host, the pressure of having people over Christmas day is still there regardless of if OP is doing the cooking and cleaning or not.", "I get it.  It\u2019s best to not even let them in the door.  Your one day off would be ruined because you\u2019ll be put on the spot in front of guests.  Unless you\u2019re willing to make a scene, you\u2019d be stuck.\n\nIf he insists and steamrolls over you, do you have a friend with whom you could arrange to make plans?  Go for a long walk in the morning, come back home for dinner, and then head off to go see a movie at the movie theater?  Perhaps your sister could be enlisted? In other words, book your day up with activities and make yourself a guest for Christmas dinner.\n\nBTW, you really have to shut down the gaslighting.  It may require your recording conversations on your phone (I recommend the free app Voice Record Pro so you can easily keep them for a long time without accidentally deleting them).  It may require therapy, and if he won\u2019t go, go without him and gain some tools for managing his behavior.  You could also resort to texting him information and then saving the texts.  I know you\u2019ll figure something out, but please do work on this.  Your marriage will not survive over the long haul if he doesn\u2019t stop doing this.  It erodes trust.  You won\u2019t be able to take him at his word if he engages in this behavior.", "Your definition of \"treats me like a queen\" is different than mine. You (deservedly) approach him like a toddler who can't be relied on.", "Update us when you divorce him.", "Google \u201cnarcissist love bomb\u201d and see if you recognize some patterns in your relationship. I hope you don\u2019t but it seems like he love bombs you if you do what he wants and calls you things when you do what you want.", "Dress up nicely, sit with a cup with a hot chocolate and appreciate publicly your huspand for hosting this year because unfortunately you have to work and don't have enough time. Luckily how good man he is.\n\nOtherwise he is not and it doesn't matter he is at other areas. He is intentionally and straighforward manipulating you and he knows that. If you're not admitting that you're lying to yourself.", "Stop bailing him out. Stop engaging at all. This is why he does it: because it works for him. \n\nIf he says he's going to host and you dont have to do anything, sing his praises loud and long to his whole family, before and during the event, he knew you had no time off and were run off your feet and he wanted to put on such a nice party for you and the whole family in honor of your first married Christmas! He said you should just sit back and enjoy a nice cup of cocoa and not worry about a thing since you worked so hard on the wedding! And if it wasn't for him agreeing to do that, none of this would be happening because you got no time off before or after! \n\nLet him hear you do it. Then sleep in on the day of, get yourself that cup of cocoa, read a book, whatever. Maybe take a walk later in the day. But don't lift a finger. Not once. Shamelessly remind him at intervals how good husbands like him really know how to take care of their wife and family. If it starts going sideways, ignore it or take another walk. But do. Not. Help. If it gets dicey, don't engage, just leave for a couple hours or stay at a hotel for the night. Text to say you're safe and off relaxing because he agreed you wouldn't have to do anything and you're holding him to it. Then shut your phone off.\n\nYou have to either teach him early and with certainty that this shit is never going to work for him again, prepare to live with his BS until one of you dies, or start planning your divorce. Those are your only choices.", "OP, just tell him that you don't want people over then.\n\nYou're going to be exhausted from Christmas Eve shoppers.\n\nYou won't have time to mentally prepare for Boxing Day shoppers unless you sit down and do nothing.\n\nYou cannot do that if you are making sure that guests are looked after up to your standards. And I totally know what you mean.\n\nWhy don't you just ask BIL if he could kindly co host this year with your husband at his place? They pair up and do it together.", "So far you\u2019ve cited instances of him gaslighting you and you know he\u2019s relying on you in somewhat akin to weaponized incompetence - if YOU know you\u2019d be pressured to do the work, he knows it too. And you just got married! Bring this issues up to him, explain how this is unacceptable behavior and if he\u2019s really such a great guy he\u2019ll be willing to work through his manipulative bs.", "Of course he\u2019s banking on her giving in. This is his history with her. If she wasn\u2019t so \u2018sweet,\u2019 (always rushing in to do damage control) then he wouldn\u2019t pull this cr@p all the time. Manipulators always come out on top.

It's not your job because your a woman. \n\nHe can ask you to host but he can't demand it and he's demanding it because you are a woman and it's woman's work. \n\nIf he hosts then you'll have tons of people in your space so you will need to set boundaries and have a talk with your husband. \n\nBut you two need couples therapy as he is incapable of communicating properly", "It's quite simple then... IF he wants to host, he can. Tell him exactly what you just said here. 'I don't mind you hosting Christmas, as long as I don't have to do anything for it. But I'm pretty sure the day of, you're going to forget us agreeing you're doing the hosting solo, and you'll dump it on me.'   \nIf he tries to reassure you that 'this time' it will be diffirent, take a piece of paper and a sharpie and just write ' OPs Husbands name will be hosting Christmas solo this year, and do all the shopping, cooking, and cleaning. OP will not have to help with anything other than be cheerful on the day itself. OPs Husbands name will NOT be dumping hosting Christmas on OP last minute, or otherwise.'   \nHave him sign it, and take a picture of it.

I\u2019m happy to offer lessons on how garbage you feel, if you need to act it out.", "Spot on - plus make 20 plus cups of coffee", "And record the conversation on your phone just so he won't be able to back track.
