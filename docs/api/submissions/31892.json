Well I planned our wedding all the way through and it was ALOT. I love hosting but everyone gets burned out sometimes. After we got married I TOLD my husband, who wanted to travel to his moms for thanksgiving, that if we do that it would be impossible for me to get the day before or after Christmas off too(I\u2019m a manager in retail and had almost 4 weeks off between September and mid October for the wedding) and so I am not going to want to host anyone since I\u2019ll only have the one day(Christmas Day)off and not the day before or after. I don\u2019t want to have to clean or have extra people in my house or have to make a big spread since that\u2019s how they like to do it. Now we are in our 30s but both of my parents have been passed 3+years now,I\u2019m not super close to any of my family that lives nearby, and the family I am very close to live on the other side of the US. My husband\u2019s family(his aunt, brother and cousins) all live near us, like in the same city. We see them all the time(literally every function is his whole family,and occasionally my sister) and also we traveled(10hr drive each way) to see his mom for thanksgiving and spent 3 days staying at her house. Now I DO love his family, and as far as I know they like me as well. His mom will be staying with us at Christmas, which I\u2019m totally cool with, but I don\u2019t want to HOST anything. And I\u2019m being treated as if I\u2019m being incredibly unfair for saying that, even though I told him this before I even asked for the time off for thanksgiving. He claims to not remember the conversation, which is beyond frustrating, and tells me I\u2019m being unfair for not wanting to host. ALSO we have a small house, and last year his mom even agreed and said she didn\u2019t want to have Christmas at our house this year(but apparently the lack of options changed her mind). His brother lives in our same town like 7 min away and has a place not much smaller than ours, they could host but don\u2019t want to I guess. Also my husband has a \u201cregular job\u201d he works M-F 7-3, weekends off and paid holidays. Because he has weekends/evenings off he usually retains more vacation time than I do and requested the day after the holiday off, and Christmas is on a Monday so he\u2019ll be off Saturday-Tuesday. I may get lucky and get the day after Xmas off,but I doubt it based on the way our scheduling works.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to host anyone??", "created_utc": 1701136991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185ko64/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_want_to_host/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Better yet, have the conversation and record it.

If he wants to host, then by all means, let him do so. Are you the resident party planner/chef/maid? Is he just unwilling to do the actual work of hosting so he's trying to hoist it off onto you?

You can send out a group text telling everyone you have no time off to plan a dinner, but wouldn't it be fun to go out for the holiday, with no one having to clean up after!\n\nIf his heart is irrevocably set on hosting at your home, let him host. But truly let him do it. If he does it badly, so be it. A similar group text could be:\n\n\"Hi, everyone - I won't have any time off from work to host, so husband is doing it all! Don't judge me, lol. I bet he's going to be great at it! I can't wait to see you all. xo\"\n\nMy last suggestion is for you to start texting him about everything, so you have a digital trail when he pulls his \"You never told me that\" bullshit.\n\nGood luck!", "As far as I am concerned, holiday hosting should always be rotated.", "NTA. get your self a therapist and a lawyer for christmas", "Id be petty if i were you.

He denies either you or he said something or agreed on something.\n\nThis is too close to being gaslighted. It's something my ex tried for several months until his daughter came to visit and called him on it.\n\nHaving to run a video caught by your cameras is handy for proving what you said. But a bit much.\n\nYou're stressed and tired because of recently overextending yourself, and you don't have any vacation days. By disregarding your preferences and your needs, he's not being considerate or respectful. \n\nThis is something you could explore in couples counseling.", "INFO: Why do you have to do anything? Let him host and DO NOTHING. And stick to it. \n\nYou don't realize how unbalanced your relationship is but it is going to wear you down in the end. When you are ready for it check out videos on youtube on how narcissists behave. See if the shoe fits.", "NTA. Christmas is hell. It ought to be cancelled.", "NTA.

She would cook and so would he.", "It is 100% gaslighting. He will agree to anything if he feels he can pretend to not remember last minute and corner you into agreeing just to not have an argument. You made it clear in advance, but now you seem unreasonable and selfish because \u201cthere\u2019s nowhere else to host anyways\u201d. You shouldn\u2019t have to collect evidence of what you two say so you can defend yourself.", "NTA. If he wants to entertain his family over Christmas, then HE'S free to host, make or buy all the food, and hire a cleaning crew to clean up afterward. As we're a little more than three and a half weeks outside of Christmas, there's more than enough time for him to make these arrangements.\n\nAnd as for saying he \"doesn't remember\" you telling him you don't want to host Christmas this year, your calm reply should be, \"Well, I'm telling you \\*now.\\*\" And stand firm.

But first, take a video of him agreeing to do everything", "He sounds like a manipulative, lazy, gaslighting asshole.", "Get a hotel room. Have a little spa day, and go straight to work from there the next day.", "This is exactly it. Reminds me of the husband who liked to host spontaneous bbqs and the only thing he did was grilled while the wife prepped side dishes, drinks, grocery shopped, cleaned before and after, etc. \n\nSit your husband down and tell him you will do absolutely nothing because you\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want to host and won\u2019t have the luxury to rest after hosting.", "Record? No, make him sign a freaking contract that lays this out. And record him signing it. I don\u2019t believe for a second he forgets.
