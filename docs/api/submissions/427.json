My husband works shifts while I work long hours at a marketing company.\n\n\nSo far we've had no issues til yesterday. I came home at 6pm and noticed the babysitter's wet hair and new clothes. She told me she took a shower after one of the kids spilled milk on her. I was confused but visibly upset but she tried to \"reassure\" me the kids were fine, because my husband watched them while she took her shower which only lasted for few minutes. I was more confused that my husband was home when he had a shift to cover. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate of her to shower in my home like that. She argued that it was fine and that she had no choice and couldn't leave the milk on her like that. We argued and my husband heard the commotion and got involved. He said it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be but I told the babysitter that I did not appreciate how she basically ignored how I felt about this and dismissed my feelings still. She went home, but we still argued on the phone. She thinks she's done nothing wrong and said I was being unfair when I mentioned potentially cutting from her salary after that.\n\n\nMy husband keeps saying that I'm overreacting and the \"poor girl\" couldn't handle having milk stains on her body and clothes. But I couldn't help feel it was inappropriate and she shouldve checked with me.\n\n\n\nAITA for my reaction? Just for info. I'm the one who pays her, not my husband. I told her to call or text (always available) if anything happens. I didn't even know my husband was home at the time! If you noticed, I said that I argued with her even before she told me my husband was home. And no I didn't know how big the stain was but she argued about being covered in milk for 6+hrs. As for the question of why my husband didn't go to work? He said he was feeling a bit sick and swapped shifts with a coworker.\n\n\nThe babysitter is 24. She said she has experience and yes she normally brings a bag of clothes, wet wipes and stuff like that with her.", "created_utc": 1667064781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygpn3f/aita_for_telling_my_kids_babysitter_that_it_was/", "score": 15466, "replies": ["This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "Are you really just concerned about a quick shower and some spilt milk?

Worst case scenario she\u2019s sleeping with husband and they\u2019re trying to make up crap to cover it up but best case scenario what? This woman gets milk on her shirt and just hops in the shower? Seriously?? Over milk? Does she have plans after and figure she can just get away with not working and pawn off her job on sick husband and use work time to get ready for a party? I mean idk about you but I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s and the last time a friend asked me to watch their kids I didn\u2019t pack a spare outfit and toiletries to shower in their house *just in case* milk was going to get spilled on. This is WEIRD behavior. You don\u2019t just go work in someone\u2019s house and hop in the shower especially without permission. If she\u2019s totally innocent then her problem solving skills are extremely lacking. Wipe it with a damp cloth it\u2019ll air dry in 10 minutes and you can make it until you get home before you shower. I love the people saying babysitter should run. Personally I don\u2019t want her to come back anyway. There is NOTHING normal about this situation. \n\nOn a side note I don\u2019t agree with OP\u2019s approach.

Obviously we have no proof, but I can\u2019t lie that husband and the babysitter look highly suspicious.

He is also not that sick where he can\u2019t work at all, because he is taking a coworkers. \n\nOP pays the babysitter, so one could argue that\u2019s why she stayed. OP is her boss, and she wanted to get paid.", "Okay I agree with most of your point, and I agree that it's sus - but can we please stop with \"He should've been in bed if he was so sick\"? Because that makes it harder for people who are genuinely sick to get time off work.\n\nThe reality is for most people, being home does not require as much energy as being at work. That *is* a state of rest, in and of itself. You don't have to be in bed to be resting. You can be playing video games, watching tv, or even doing light chores - and *still* be \"resting\" in comparison to being at work. Not to mention when you're home you can sit down as long as you need, use the toilet or eat whenever you need - those things all make a difference.  \nEven like, watching the kids for a few minutes - that's *very* different to watching them for a whole day. We're talking about entirely different things here. It is pretty easy to watch children for like ten minutes. It doesn't require a whole lot. A lot of *very* sick people could do that.\n\nSo that argument of \"If you're really sick you should be in bed\" is just inaccurate - and it's all too often weaponised against workers who actually *were* sick, in order to force them back to work. That's why I don't like it being used, personally.", "As someone who has done a lot of babysitting and worked with young children at a daycare, packing extra clothes is not weird at all. I always have a FULL change of clothes (including undergarments and socks and shoes) that I leave in my car when I babysit or when I worked at the daycare. The amount of times that young kids or babies can pee, throw up, or spill stuff on you is unbelievable. You\u2019re often holding them or they\u2019re sitting on your lap, so all kinds of things can get all over you. Children are messy and gross", "I would be putting the blame on the husband here with the lack of evidence.\nLike you said, if she felt she had to stay to get paid as she is paid by OP, then he would be in effect forcing his presence on her really. \nThe babysitter also hasn't been deceptive, she was honest about the shower, and honest about the husband being home, he was the one that didn't notify his wife that he had stayed home. So if she is trying to be a mistress, she is doing a bad job of it. \n\nI don't find the bag of clothes suspicious, if she carries a bag with wipes and assorted clothes for babysitting just in case- it makes sense to me. My sons daycare bag has a few different items because I couldn't be bothered repacking it everyday based on the weather, so there is a few things if it's warm, a few things if it's cold.\nKids are disgusting and always sticky, I regularly have to change my shirt at home because of the food and bodily fluids they manage to get on me.", "I say in bed because I think if he was feeling genuinely unwell and he had someone available to watch the kids, it's a good time to rest away from them.\n\nBeing in a difference room of any kind would do the trick, bed is just a nice place to lay down by yourself even if you are just watching tv or your phone or something, and kids tend to respect boundary that a little better than another living room for example. I guess I should have specified but I did not think it would be an issue. I am a mother and a nurse, I 100% understand there is a difference between fit to work and unable to do anything at all and I'm sorry if I offended you, I have edited my comment to make that clearer.\n\nMy main point was, don't feel sick and intrude on the babysitters space too much when she is trying to look after the kids. She didn't sign on for that, and some young women would not feel comfortable with that, especially the stigma of the baby sitting role. \n\nI also don't know what OPs husbands actions were or how he was spending his day off, I was asking it as a question and hoping he wasn't", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I completely agree. I shouldn\u2019t have included the babysitter, that was my bad. OP needs to stop scapegoating the woman. I\u2019ve said in several comments she jumped to conclusions, and there isn\u2019t evidence of any wrongdoing on her part. Her husband is the one being fishy.
