He could just see the transaction record and the amount of money in each account, so there\u2019s no risk of either of them taking money from my account or identity theft or anything, it was just the fact that she went through the records to try to prove a point that got to me.\n\nMy uncle\u2019s started the process of getting himself removed from my account, so this won\u2019t be a problem anymore, but I\u2019ll keep the things you mentioned in mind in case something else happens!"]}
