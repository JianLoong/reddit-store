Me and my dad grew up with a rocky relationship. Him and my mom split before I was even born. He missed out on 90% my school functions and was never one to really believe me. He was the father who needed \u201cproof and evidence\u201d in order to believe a word I ever said. I have PTSD from my childhood from both sides but honestly the trauma from him hurt more then from my mother. My father has held himself on this high horse for forever and he likes keeping a eye on us (me n my older sister) but not like most parents we had apps downloaded on our phones so he had 100% access to our phones whenever he wanted. We had cameras in our house because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t trust us\u201d. We weren\u2019t really that bad for kids either. So what made me snap on him was the social media stalking. Since my 18 th birthday I told him to leave me alone online. What I post is what I post. Well 2 years later almost n he\u2019s still having his friends stalk my profiles. He don\u2019t like some the things I post so he started ignoring me. I messaged him June24 about issues with my car and he ignored me. I texted him July 28 about a promotion n he ignored me. I then texted him july 29 and he ignored me again so I blocked his number for a few months but unblocked him in September. When I got engaged in October I sent out the same thing to everyone a picture of the ring with the caption \u201cI said yes\u201d. I waited a whole week before I texted him \u201cI would just like to say thanks. Thanks for ignoring the good news I share. Thanks for making me feel like less to you and thank you for showing me where I stand here. Since u had no care to comment on my engagement I will let u know Stepdad will be walking me down the aisle. I don't care if u r mad bout whatever u can at least congratulate ur damn kid\u201d to which we got in a argument about how I chose my stepdad over him n how he did his best. Now my step dad has always been in my life since I was 1 I\u2019m 19 now. He showed up when needed n Ik I can call him n he will drop everything to come. He taught me how to ride a bike and tie my shoes. All the things a dads meant to do. My father didn\u2019t do those things. After my father pretty much said he was the best dad I went off listing my trauma from him to which I got \u201cand what do u want me to do about that\u201d pretty much. I asked for a apology for the shitty things I had to deal with cuz him n he turned it around to \u201cwhy do I got to apologize but you don\u2019t\u201d. I haven\u2019t responded from there and I obviously sit some of our fight but that\u2019s cuz we were sending paragraphs back n forth fighting over this. My stepdad tho thinks I may regret not having my actual dad do it but I\u2019m at the point I\u2019m feeling strongly about not even sending my father a invite.

Congrats on the engagement!", "NTA. Also frankly I would be no contact. He didn\u2019t trust you even before having a reason to invade your privacy, he argues with you forgetting he is suppose to be the adult (what do you want me to do about it? Really?!), ignores your news among other things. \n\nWhat positives does he bring, if any?", "NTA, there's a huge difference between a dad and a father.  Your step dad is in fact dad.  He's busted his butt to be present for you, your father did not.  Give him the honor of walking you down the aisle.  Block the  DNA donor and move on with life.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for recognizing that a single sperm does not make a father! Showing up every day for every activity - that is your father, and he is the one who deserves the honour of walking you down the aisle!\n\nCongrats on your upcoming nuptials!", "NTA, I love the way your step father treated you!! I love when step parents step up!! With that said, I don't agree with your step dad about sending your \"dad\" an invite to your wedding. This \"dad\" is a source of some awful childhood trauma and a wedding is not the time and place to be having flashbacks and possible unpleasant interaction with this man. If your \"dad\" really wanted to be there, he would have made an effort a long long long time ago. Enjoy your day with the people that love and cherish you.", "NTA. Anyone can be a father but it seems only one was a dad. Biology only takes you so far. Congratulations! Enjoy your wedding", "NTA. It\u2019s not a child\u2019s responsibility to apologize for a lackluster relationship \u2014 he is and always was the adult. If either of my children ever told me I caused them any trauma or wanted to discuss things I\u2019d done that hurt them, I would be beside myself apologizing and owning up to it.", "NTA - Your stepdad has taken on the role as a parent and your biological father is just the sperm donor at this point. You would regret not having a loving parent walking you down the isle. \n\nTbh you should just drop your dad until he gets his act together if ever.", "NTA\n\nYour bio dad sounds awful and I'm sorry for what he put you through. Since he refuses to listen to you and won't apologize, he doesn't deserve to walk you down the aisle at your wedding.", "NTA. Your dad is the one who was there for you when needed. It sounds in your case like your stepdad took that role and deserves the honor of walking you down the aisle. If you really think you would regret it, you could have them both do it.", "NTA. Your bio dad was an absentee father, while you step-dad was there for every milestone in your life.  Of course he deserves this honor, he's earned it.", "I wouldn\u2019t even invite him to the wedding. Ur bio dads an asshole.", "NTA. Stepdad IS your dad regardless of dna.", "NTA you need to apologize for stuff you did but he has no need to apologize for what he did? \"Sorry for the diaper blow outs\" \"sorry for the crying when I was little\" \"sorry for all the kid stuff\" oh wait you were never there you dropped me off with someone else to watch me until I was old enough to find for myself", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
