Me and my dad grew up with a rocky relationship. Him and my mom split before I was even born. He missed out on 90% my school functions and was never one to really believe me. He was the father who needed \u201cproof and evidence\u201d in order to believe a word I ever said. I have PTSD from my childhood from both sides but honestly the trauma from him hurt more then from my mother. My father has held himself on this high horse for forever and he likes keeping a eye on us (me n my older sister) but not like most parents we had apps downloaded on our phones so he had 100% access to our phones whenever he wanted. We had cameras in our house because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t trust us\u201d. We weren\u2019t really that bad for kids either. So what made me snap on him was the social media stalking. Since my 18 th birthday I told him to leave me alone online. What I post is what I post. Well 2 years later almost n he\u2019s still having his friends stalk my profiles. He don\u2019t like some the things I post so he started ignoring me. I messaged him June24 about issues with my car and he ignored me. I texted him July 28 about a promotion n he ignored me. I then texted him july 29 and he ignored me again so I blocked his number for a few months but unblocked him in September. When I got engaged in October I sent out the same thing to everyone a picture of the ring with the caption \u201cI said yes\u201d. I waited a whole week before I texted him \u201cI would just like to say thanks. Thanks for ignoring the good news I share. Thanks for making me feel like less to you and thank you for showing me where I stand here. Since u had no care to comment on my engagement I will let u know Stepdad will be walking me down the aisle. I don't care if u r mad bout whatever u can at least congratulate ur damn kid\u201d to which we got in a argument about how I chose my stepdad over him n how he did his best. Now my step dad has always been in my life since I was 1 I\u2019m 19 now. He showed up when needed n Ik I can call him n he will drop everything to come. He taught me how to ride a bike and tie my shoes. All the things a dads meant to do. My father didn\u2019t do those things. After my father pretty much said he was the best dad I went off listing my trauma from him to which I got \u201cand what do u want me to do about that\u201d pretty much. I asked for a apology for the shitty things I had to deal with cuz him n he turned it around to \u201cwhy do I got to apologize but you don\u2019t\u201d. I haven\u2019t responded from there and I obviously sit some of our fight but that\u2019s cuz we were sending paragraphs back n forth fighting over this. My stepdad tho thinks I may regret not having my actual dad do it but I\u2019m at the point I\u2019m feeling strongly about not even sending my father a invite.

Really?!), ignores your news among other things. \n\nWhat positives does he bring, if any?", "NTA, there's a huge difference between a dad and a father.  Your step dad is in fact dad.

Block the  DNA donor and move on with life.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for recognizing that a single sperm does not make a father! Showing up every day for every activity - that is your father, and he is the one who deserves the honour of walking you down the aisle!\n\nCongrats on your upcoming nuptials!", "NTA, I love the way your step father treated you!! I love when step parents step up!! With that said, I don't agree with your step dad about sending your \"dad\" an invite to your wedding. This \"dad\" is a source of some awful childhood trauma and a wedding is not the time and place to be having flashbacks and possible unpleasant interaction with this man. If your \"dad\" really wanted to be there, he would have made an effort a long long long time ago. Enjoy your day with the people that love and cherish you.", "NTA.

Your bio dad was an absentee father, while you step-dad was there for every milestone in your life.  Of course he deserves this honor, he's earned it.", "I wouldn\u2019t even invite him to the wedding. Ur bio dads an asshole.", "NTA. Stepdad IS your dad regardless of dna.", "NTA you need to apologize for stuff you did but he has no need to apologize for what he did? \"Sorry for the diaper blow outs\" \"sorry for the crying when I was little\" \"sorry for all the kid stuff\" oh wait you were never there you dropped me off with someone else to watch me until I was old enough to find for myself", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't say \"Did you see my message?\" or \"I would appreciate it if you acknowledged my messages as soon as you see them.\". Instead, you turn it into a test that he failed and now you exact revenge.\n\nBy all means, have your stepfather walk down the aisle.  He was your defacto father for most of your life.  \n\nStop playing these mindgames with your dad.  Go LC or NC if you want but don't set up these little tests he doesn't know the rules for and pick a fight when he doesn't pass.  \n\nThe key to keeping someone like your father in your life is to accept that he's never going to become who or what you want.  You'll never the relationship you need.  So accept it's expect it, and decide to either cut it off entirely or work to change your expectations. \n\nTell yourself something like this:\n\nMy dad wants to see me once or twice a year.

U sound like u have never even had such troubles in ur life if your just \u201cur playing a game\u201d no I\u2019m living my life.

The moment he left your mom he gave up all parental rights to you .The one to walk you down the aisle should go to the one who\u2019s been there for you as a parent figure and who you trust the most. Not some controlling ahole who pretends to be a dad. \n\nAlthough to make you feel less guilty you could always  offer your dna donor the father daughter dance.

He had cameras in your house??  That is creepy.", "NTA, and you don\u2019t need to share any backstory \u2014 the fact that you even feel the need to \u201cprove\u201d your biological father mistreated you when your hurt is palpable in your every word is only further evidence your bio dad traumatized you deeply. Congratulations on the engagement, and on having the clarity to know that siring children does not make you a father.", "NTA - some of your story resonates with my own and just no, you\u2019re NTA. I could list all the reasons, but just go enjoy your special day when it comes!", "I don\u2019t understand this at all. You lived with your mom and step father but your BIO-FATHER has cameras in your home and your parent allows this. If so that is madness"]}
