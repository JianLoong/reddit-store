Especially when my partner and i offered to host and sleep on the couch so they could have our bed. and especially when if they really wanted us there it would be no financial stress to pay for us to get there either. of course i never asked for that, but they are paying for my younger brothers airfare with the excuse that he is still in school, he\u2019s getting his BSc i just finished mine and got admittted to an MSc so i\u2019m about to be a student again too. but he\u2019s the golden child so that\u2019s not surprising. \n\nthe question is am i the asshole for not moving heaven and earth (selling something that i own or dipping into long term savings for my tuition) in order to be at my parents house for christmas when they won\u2019t come here or help financially like they are helping my brother.", "created_utc": 1700391695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yusfz/aita_for_not_selling_something_to_see_my_parents/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Use their own logic against them, because what they're doing is highly manipulative. \n\nYou should come up with a list of \"duties\" you think parents have towards their adult children. If they disagree, you can say \"Ok, agree to disagree about the respective duties of children and parents\", and then hang up on them and give them the silent treatment for weeks. \n\nYour parents are acting like children.
