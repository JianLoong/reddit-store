I offered to visit before or after the holidays because it was about a third of the price and told them they were free to visit us, but they never took me up on it.

This is a power play from your parents to see what kind of hoops you\u2019ll jump through for them and what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice to keep them happy.  You\u2019re not putting money over your family.  Your prioritizing keeping a roof over you head and paying your bills.  Any money saved is already allocated for legitimate expenses.

We both grew up a little bitter about it and it continued well into my late 30s. The very first time I said I'd like to stay at home with my husband and just have our own Christmas morning it was like we dropped a nuke on the family. We did the same thing as you suggesting the relatives could drive the 4 hrs down the snow-covered highways and spend Christmas with us, but they made it quite clear that was out of the question.

When my mom married my dad and moved half way around the world, she didn't return to see her parents for 10 years (and after having 3 kids). My parents couldn't afford the travel before then. Her parents were overjoyed to see her. But for the 10 years in-between, they wrote letters (and sent telegrams for special occasions like our births). The love and care was deep and mutual, without anyone needing to do the impossible to prove it.", "Yup. My mom was *obsessed* with having the whole family home for the holidays...so she paid for my travel every year. Because she actually, genuinely wanted me there. Your parents don't care about you, they care about you showing you \"know your place\" beneath them.", "Absolutely unhinged and manipulative behavior on their part. To call you evil, evil?! I'm 40 and my mom has never called me evil. Talk about dramatic. I wouldn't go just because they've spoiled the whole thing with their awful attitudes. You are NTA by a loooong mile. I hope you can shake off the guilt they are trying to foist upon you and have some lovely holidays with people who would never treat you this way. These are the kind of parents who are shocked when their kids go no contact, which btw, you would be more than justified in wanting to cut this kind of toxicity out of your life.", "I already agree 100% NTA, but with this information I\u2019m convinced this is all rooted in homophobia and possibly sexism. At the very least it\u2019s favoritism and it\u2019s unfair to you and your partner. The fact they\u2019d so easily pay for your brother **who lives in the same city as you** but won\u2019t pay for you SCREAMS all kinds of discrimination. I\u2019m so sorry OP. I hope you and your partner have a beautiful Christmas with your pups \ud83e\ude75", "thank you for your detailed response! and the good luck haha :) i really appreciate both!", "* *She*\n\n>my (24f) [\u2026] live with my partner of two years (25f)", "My apologies.  She's absolutely right about what she said to op. They should spend a nice, cozy Christmas together. My advice would be jammies all day, Christmas movies, and snacks.", "Honestly i wouldnt go hating them for this 100%. Youre right that its a control thing, but also as parents theyre probably just reacting very emotionally to something they dont know how to react to quite yet. Take your time to be mad at them for now, but try to be ready to forgive them when they eventually come around. Moving away from your parents can be hard sometimes, eventually theyll be able to see why its good for them and you", "Your parents don\u2019t deserve you. What your father said was particularly unforgivable. They are being selfish and controlling. Enjoy your holiday without them.", "Don't feel guilty. It's the consequences of their own actions.", "Her father called her evil! There's no excuse for this.  She should go nc immediately.", "Sorry, but evil is mild in terms of things ive heard parents say to their kids. She should go nc for a while but give them a chance in a while", "> Sorry, but evil is mild in terms of things ive heard parents say to their kids.\n\nSorry, but you have allowed the people you have been dealing with to warp your mind. Calling your child \u2018evil\u2019 for no good reason might be \u2018mild\u2019 compared to what you\u2019ve seen and I\u2019m sorry in that case that you\u2019ve seen it, but *it\u2019s still very much not ok*.", "So because \"other kids have it worse\" OP shouldn't be upset that her parents are mistreating her? Gtfo.", "NTA. Your parents are making this into a bigger issue than it needs to be. Spend time with your partner and enjoy your holidays. Even if you find some way to visit your parents, it doesn't sound like they're going to make for a pleasant visit. Spare yourself.", "NTA, you're an adult making your own decisions and your parents can't handle that so are trying to guilt trip you into going home.", "Duuuuddddeeee....NTA but your parents are. They're not being realistic here and trying to gaslight you for it", "NTA, you aren't choosing money over your family, because you don't actually have the money! If your mother is so adamant that you come home every year, then she can budget to pay for your holiday travel. Do not undermine yourself financially just because your mother refuses to understand that you are an adult with your own home now. My mother, as awful as she can be, recommended that my husband and I have \"totally naked Christmas\" when we got our own home, which is where you stay in with your spouse and scare away any potential visitors by saying \"sorry, we're going to be naked that day.\" \ud83d\ude05 You don't actually have to be nude, comfy Christmas pj's are highly recommended, but it puts a hard barrier between you and anyone that you would not like to be naked around, for the holidays or whenever! You are not the asshole, tell your mom you think plane tickets are a great gift and that you'll see her next year, maybe. Happy holidays to you and your girlfriend!", "Let me get this straight\n\nChoosing money over family is evil, but choosing convenience over family is OK? I feel like one of those things is worse than the other...\n\nNTA, they are unhinged to blow up at you over this.", "The line that kills me is \u201cPeople who choose money over their family regret it.\u201d It seems like your parents are choosing money they don\u2019t want to give to support their wish for you to go to them for Christmas. \n\nCongrats on being a student again as well \ud83e\udd73", "NTA it sounds like your parents hate you because you aren't a man, and aren't going to give them GRAAAAAANDBABIESSSSSS.", "NTA - If they wanted you there so bad, they would offer to help - maybe pay for the tickets, seeing as you have to pay for a pet sitter or similar.", "Your parents are the AH with how they approached the whole situation. Couldn't be me lol", "NTA\n\nmaybe you should call them and tell them that you are meeting a guy in a dark alley next Tuesday to see how much you can get for selling a kidney.", "NTA\n\nFWIW most parents pay for their kids to come home for the holidays until the kids are financially stable. \n\nMy parents would fly my brother and his family because it was logistically much simpler than if my parents flew to visit my brother and probably less expensive as well.", "NTA - they have shown their true colours and you\u2019re better off without them. Enjoy your holidays!", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation and \"We won't be there\" and not being there, worked just fine. Parents and family can call all they want, but it doesn't mean I'm answering.", "Oh, NTA.  I'm sorry that you have to find out about your parents true nature this way.  Please live your best life  - whether it includes them or not...", "You are definitely NTA.  It he extremely entitled of your parents to expect the you must turn up for Christmas with them.  Personally after their behaviour I would block them and go no contact.", "NTA  \n\n\nOP, I am so glad to read you ditched them when you turned 18. They sound controlling af. Tell them that unless they are going to play the amount to come see them, that they are now on either LC or NC (up to you) until they apologize. Hell, I wouldn't want to see them either even if I did have the money (imo).   \n\n\nBut I am also the type that refuses to spend Christmas with my family because they are very toxic.", "NTA, your parents are being extremely demanding and controlling.  It is not evil to stay at home and avoid travel if you cannot afford it.  If it is so important they can send a round trip ticket.", "NTA, and certainly not evil.  What, you should sell all your possessions?  Go without power, or be out on the streets, to spend a few days with them?  If they want you there so much, it sounds like they can afford to help.  Or are they putting money over family, too?", "Only AH's here are your parents!", "Reading your post, from the very beginning, after the sentence about \"duty\", I knew you're NTA.   \nHOW, ffs, could you have a good time, if someone is considering you being there as your \"duty\"???  \nEven if I had a lot of money, I wouldn't go, hearing the word \"duty\".   \nYou're a grown up, independent person and you can choose how you want to spend your  holliday.   \nStay at home and relax, have a little, cosy Christmas with your partner and I assure you, that it will be wonderful time :).   \nLife is too short to waste it on bad experiences, which you can avoid :).", "Yeah, when I was a broke student living a few hours away my mum paid for my trip because she wanted me home for the holiday and I wanted to go too. If your company was the most important thing then they'd pay.", "Don't go. I doubt you will \"regret\" it for one second. On the contrary, you'll have a wonderfully relaxed, loving, parent-stress free Christmas with your loved one.", "I want to have my son for Christmas - he should travel to my country from the place he's living now.   \nI asked him:  \na) if he WANTS to come and is able (free from work)  \nb) if he has enough of money to do it or if he needs some help  \n(last year he came on his own, but I didn't want to drain his budget, so I bought his return plane ticket )  \nIt works two ways. I want him for Christmas, he wants to come, we both are putting some effort to make it happen :).", ">\u201cyou could never understand how we feel you don\u2019t have kids\u201d\n\nYet they can pay for your brother but not you ... speaks volumes.\n\nMy sisters and me (the kids) are scattered across the world. We aren't always able to visit every Xmas, sometimes for years. Our parents understood, though they would obviously like their kids home for Xmas.\n\nYou sound like a well-grounded person with her head on straight - I wish you, your partner and your fur babies a happy and peaceful Xmas!", " You\u2019re welcome! Your parents are just assholes. I do have a question: is your culture such that this is normal? I know some cultures are way more family-oriented. It doesn\u2019t really matter - they are still being jerks and you can do what you want with your life.", "OP is a woman.  Most people, especially outside of Western culture, but even within Western culture it's still most people, think the sole reason women exist is to take care of men and raise children.", "To me it sounds lime you know exactly what the problem is and you\u2019re not the AH and just, for some reason, need other people to reassure you? Put on your big girl panties and grow a spine."]}
