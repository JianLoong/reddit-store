While it was hard for Sarah to adapt at first, she loves us and is our daughter. She's an amazing kid and loves me and my family.\n\nI'm currently pregnant and two weeks ago we found out it was a girl. When we told my parents they were excited about their \"first granddaughter\". It bother me but I tried to ignore it. But yesterday I had enough. Mum was mentioning things to pass down and I reacted stronger than I probably should have, but I was pretty mad. Sarah is their grandaughter since she was 2. Luckily they didn't say it around Sarah but I was not happy. We had a fight over it, with them claiming Sarah doesn't count and trying to justify it by saying she's from my husband's family not ours. But she's my daughter, their grandaughter. She calls them her grandparents. My sister is her aunt and my nephew is her cousin. If they don't accept Sarah then there's no way I'm wanting them around either daughter.\n\nMy husband thinks what they said was wrong but thinks I should let it go. He thinks it wasn't meant the way I'm taking it. But with his history he tends to be a bit of a push over when it comes to family (understanding obviously, but still) and they haven't apologied, if anything they've double down. I don't want Sarah hearing any of this, and if I can't trust them to treat our girls equal then I can't trust them with them.

There is not one person in our family who doesn't consider those kids our family.  We weren't asked how we felt about it. They didn't ask our opinions on fostering or adoption. This was their way of safely adding to their family. The oldest couldn't be adopted and is now in their 20s. They are still family to us and included in every way the kids who are related by blood are. I call them my nieces and nephews, because that's what they are. I didn't ask them how they'd feel about me getting pregnant and having a child either. However one chooses (or doesn't) to add a child to the family, that child should be accepted in the same way all others are. \n\nThe only possible exception, in my opinion, would be for step children that have other family members on the other side and came into the family later (like they already have 4 grandparents so the step grandparents may not have college funds set up for them like they did at birth for bio-grandchildren). Even then, to me, I treat them all as my nieces and nephews.", "Nah.  Grandparents are shit.

This situation is basically that.\n\nIf I reread your comment in the context of step kids I agree with most of it. Step kids have other parents that are not you. They have grandparents that are not your parents. They usually are not known from birth and don't spend all their time with you. Adopted children are children. Adopted is an adjective of biology, NOT of family. \n\nMy son is half-adopted. His favorite grandma is blood, his favorite grandpa is a step, his favorite cousin is adopted. He does not care which family members share DNA with him unless he's musing about a unique physical trait. To him, having DNA in common is as mundane as having the hair color in common.

You're the AH.", "They have every right to their feelings, that's true. And OP has every right to protect her oldest daughter from the consequences of their feelings. If they're not mature enough to understand Sarah's adoption is just as valid a way to enter into a family as the new baby's birth then I guess they're not mature enough to be grandparents. Having conflicting feelings is one thing, outright saying things that would severely hurt a child if overheard is something completely different. They can take their feelings and keep them the hell away from OP and her daughter that has already lost one mother and doesn't need anybody questioning the validity of the other. They will absolutely treat the children differently if they view one as their grandchild and the other as a charity case, whether they mean to or not. They have the right to their harmful feelings, they don't have the right to expose OP's family to them. Instead of having two granddaughters, they can have none. But they don't get to accept one while not accepting the other. \n\nSometimes the way a person feels can negatively affect another and that's when you decide that you don't belong together. Stand by your feelings, but do it at a distance where they're not going to harm a literal child who has done nothing to deserve being discounted as her mother's daughter. As adults they can take responsibility for their feelings and accept the consequences that come with them. If that's how they truly feel then they don't have the right to be in either girl's life, and they shouldn't be. If it were me, I wouldn't wait for Sarah to be traumatized and left to worry about her position in the family before I'd bother to protect her from something *I already know is harmful*. \n\nI have a right to my own feelings as well and if they can't accept my daughter as their granddaughter, then they're not my parents. They can need time to adjust, time to bond, I don't expect them to *love* my child right away, but they *at least* have to accept them as *my* child which makes them their grandchild if they're *my parents*. You don't get to pick and choose which of my bonds you will acknowledge and respect and expect me to allow you in my life so that you can damage those bonds. I'm sorry, but I'll throw you to the wolves before I'll allow you to harm *my child*. I don't care who you are, if that's my baby that I've agreed to love and protect and you start making harmful remarks towards them *you're dead to me*. Literally my job to protect them from harm, so no I'm not going to expose them to something harmful just because some adult \"has feelings\". \n\nIf you have awful feelings that are damaging to those you love you *get therapy*, you don't just expect them to *deal with it*.

OP has every right to feel like her parents aren't good grandparents and cut them out of her kids' lives completely. I bet you anything they'll think it is unfair that their life is being affected by somebody else's feelings, despite the fact that's exactly what they were doing to their daughter and their daughter's daughter... Man, I wish there was an easier way to say that... Daughter's daughter is just so clunky, but apparently the word Granddaughter is only used if the parent's parents *feel* like it, it doesn't have a definitive definition like, \"the daughter of one's son or daughter\".

You mightn't remember our Norah, but she joined the family after her mother passed in childbirth and her father, who was a good man, well, he did his best, but he was never quite right after the War, so she lived with us for the most part. I remember she read from that book to you when you were just a toddler and your mother had a doctor's appointment, so Norah and I had a bit of a bet to see which of us could keep you busiest, then get you down for your nap. She won on the reading, but *I'm* the one taught you how to cut a deck and shuffle.\" -beams at two-year-old Sarah- \"This one looks promising on the blackjack front!\"\n\nAnd sure enough, nowadays Little Sarah would be at Granny's knee, playing cards for mini pretzels, reading books well above her age level and excitedly looking forward to the mischief she and her new little sister could get into, based on tales of the ridiculous antics of Granny, Norah and the other little great-grands of almost a century ago.\n\nWe just have *extra* heirlooms for the relatives we pick up, is how our family rolls.

I have a clear memory of being eight and overhearing Granny take Grandma aside and say she reckoned Aunt Jet and Uncle Teddy were expecting and if she said *one word* about the new baby that wasn't 'Josh is gonna be a big brother' or 'What a blessing to have a second one!' even though yeah, they adopted Josh from overseas, Granny would be -and that part, I didn't overhear. But even Grandma behaved herself.\n\nAnd Joey was Josh's little shadow for ages, even when he wished she would lay off. Kids would pick on him for being one of the only Korean kids at school and little Joey'd kick seven kinds of shit out of 'em, then smile, 'who, me?' and \"they were mean to my big brother...' and get off scot-free.

He passed by his own hand when I was 23 and my brother (16 at the time) had nothing to do with his paternal family after that.  They reached out to ME to try to help, but I was like, welp, you burned our bridge 7 years ago. Sorry not sorry.", "I fear if my kid beings home a lady with kids because they may die with my smother love. I have SO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE.  You're now my grandchildren. Let's make biscuits. Sorted. Hell I'd be delighted. \n\nMy son is 20 so ill have to wait. But I'm here, I have an apron and I'm READY.", "You're allowed to feel whatever you want and no one is ever an asshole for having feelings or thoughts. \n\nWhat makes you an asshole is how you choose to act because of those feelings. If you were to express such a harmful and hurtful emotion to your daughter or adopted granddaughter, you'd be an asshole. If you treated your adopted granddaughter different than you would a natural born granddaughter, you'd be an asshole. \n\nBut simply having feelings, that doesn't make you an asshole. That makes you human.", "Yikes. I pray your daughter doesn't have infertility and end up adopting a wonderful baby girl like I did.... Yeesh.", "This is \"am I the asshole\" not \"do I have the right to be an asshole\"", "Jesus Christ don\u2019t adopt a kid", "I\u2019m so sorry you got those messages. My kid is my kid no matter what. She\u2019s my heart. Anyone who thinks she\u2019s not family just because she didn\u2019t come from my body is no family of mine. Please don\u2019t ever listen to anyone who says that adopted kids aren\u2019t as loved as biological.", "Holy shit, I'm so sorry you had to go through all of that. I can't imagine my dad asking me to stop calling him that. Eleven was the age that I found out he adopted me. I started calling him Dad of my own volition soon after he and my mom started dating when I was two. It's such a formative time for a kid. I'm so sorry.", "It doesn't matter whose body/blood they come from. If you believe they are yours, like in adoption or step-kids, they ARE yours.", "Not an expert by any means but what I have read is it is just a biological/psychological programing to spread your seed/genetic material. \n\nA survival instinct, in the wild the animals that procreate the most are more likely to have offspring the will survive. That tends to perpetuate animals with the genes/desire to have more offspring. Natural selection, genes that cause a desire to have lots of offspring get passed on more.", "That\u2019s rough.  I don\u2019t know who, if any, were/are my paternal grandmother\u2019s favorites, but my sibling and I got a lot of her time and attention because we lived in the same town.  \n\nMy maternal grandparents only had four grandchildren, and they were very conscience of making things equal for all of us, right down to the Easter egg hunt we did at their house every year.  We could only pick up the eggs with our names on, and it came out to the same number of treats for each child.  All four of us lived in the same neighborhood as our grandparents and our age range only spans 4.5 years, so that probably did make it easier to keep things equitable.  But still, they took pains to make sure of it.", "Yes mi lord \ud83d\ude44\n\nMe: I can\u2019t control how other people perceive my adopted kid. I can only prepare them for reality, and create sensible boundaries for those around them\n\n\nYou: holy shit never adopt you witch", "This hurts my heart so much, I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you", "Honestly, I just want grandkids. But they are hard to get without having kids\u2026", "\n\n>There are plenty of situations where a child is legally adopted by a step parent and doesn't see them as a parent, or their bio parent is the legal parent of their step sibling and they don't see them as a sibling.\n\nThese are entirely different scenarios and largely depend on the age of the children/siblings at the time of adoption. They're also literally children and generally are held to different standards than grandparents", "I mean, yeah, maybe don\u2019t intentionally bring a kid into a family where they\u2019ll be a second class citizen", "So if I\u2019m married to a white man with a racist family, I can\u2019t have a kid with him?  \n\nyou can never control people. You can\u2019t control their perception. And what is righteous to them can be immoral to you. \n\nYou have to be equipped to deal with that, and create your boundaries. We clearly don\u2019t have an extremely deep intimate relationship with everyone we know. That extends to family. We can create boundaries and level of contact. \n\nThat grandma is entitled to her views. Op needs to gauge to situation and act accordingly. but to dismiss gma\u2019s reality is dishonest. And I don\u2019t think it grounds to ban her from a relationship with both granddaughters", "This made me cry hot tears for some reason.\n\nWonderful story, and you have a great turn of phrase!", "Both my maternal and paternal grandparents didn\u2019t even acknowledge that there was any difference between me, my bio cousins, my step cousins, and children of people my uncle who has no bio kids was dating. They were all just their grandkids. On my mom\u2019s side, I didn\u2019t even realize one cousin was actually a step cousin until I was 11. On my dad\u2019s side, my uncle\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s daughter was just another cousin and her children are now just 3 more great grandchildren. \n\nWhen I started dating my now husband, I had 3 bio kids and he had 1 bio kid. My mother treated all 4 kids exactly the the same from the first day she met my bonus child. I cannot say the same for my MIL. Her behavior eventually led to us going No Contact with her. The kids were all old enough to see the difference. OP is NTA at all.", "> So if I\u2019m married to a white man with a racist family, I can\u2019t have a kid with him?\n\nHoo boy. So, like, just not exposing your kid to their racist relatives just never even crossed your mind in this hypothetical huh. Someone sure did a number on you growing up.\n\nAnd wait, \u201cboth granddaughters??\u201d Seems like OPs parents were very clear about what they consider her adopted child to be and it\u2019s not their grandchild.", "So do I. That\u2019s so much love and happiness- I always wanted a bunch of kids around.", "Not me, but my eyes *did* sweat a little tiny bit.  Strange, that\u2026", "So sweet !", "Sounds like you have a lovely wh\u0101nau there. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
