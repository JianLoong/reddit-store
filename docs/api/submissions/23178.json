Let your kids feel their feelings, even if those feelings are anger.\n\n>He even went as far as saying she just wants to sleep around instead of parent.\n\nBased on this:\n\n>She wanted to be more free\n\nI can see where your eldest son is coming from. \n\n>It\u2019s therapy or food on the table, we are choosing food.\n\nSee if there are food banks around that you can reach out to. That might free up some funds for your eldest son's therapy.", "Something is really off in this post. \n\n>Since the youngest is in double digits we decided it was time to have them be more independent and work on their attachment issues.   \n\nWhat is going on that these kids are having attachment issues?! Attachment issues where small amount of therapy they got wasn't enough to answer the question of why they are happening in the first place?  \n\n\n>Now we are going to 50/50. \n\n>It blew the kids mind and they came to me after they got into an argument with their mother. \n\nWhat exactly \"blew their mind\" from spending more time with you? This makes me think your ex is very flighty with their care, and the kids finally see what having a more stable parent is like  \n\n>The oldest was really bad calling her mother \u201cabandoning\u201d them. He even went as far as saying she just wants to sleep around instead of parent. I told him to stop and sided with my ex. He called me an asshole and won\u2019t talk to me. AITA?\n\nOH MY GOD this was your chance! You mr oldest tried showing you WHY they are experiencing these feelings and tried opening up to you. Even if your ex isnt a bad parent, your kids are FEELING like she's not parenting enough, and instead of listening to them, you shut down the conversation. NO WONDER THEY ARE HAVING ATTACHMENT ISSUES! For somebody who cared about stability, you arent showing care for your childrens stability, and they are having trauma responses because of this  \n\n>Also his codependency is unhealthy, he installed a tracker on her phone\n\nThis is not normal but I also don't think this is codependency. Again, i have to ask what is going on while your ex has custody that the kid is this concerned about knowing where she is?   \n\nYTA for thinking defending your ex was more important than giving your kid a safe space to talk", "YTA. You does not seem very concerned by your children's distress. They clearly need therapy. BTW, You ex seems to be an Asshole Too. Who in it's right mind wants to reduce her/his kid's parenting time, to be \"more free\" ? Are you sure you eldest is not right when he suggest wants to sleep around instead of being responsible?", "First off NTA. It's refreshing to see divorced parents respect and support each other when trying their best to co-parent effectively. Good job, OP! You sound like good father. As a side note, if you're in the U.S., you should look into [CHIP](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/childrens-health-insurance-program/) if you haven't already. Depending on what state you're in, they should be able to help you find free or low cost mental healthcare (and physical healthcare) for your kids. Good luck and I wish you and your family the best as you work together through this hardship!", "NTA and a refreshing change of pace! You were smart not to let them play you both against each other", "INFO: I feel like there is a lot of information missing. Something just doesn\u2019t add up. How was the home life before the divorce? How was life at moms before the choice to change the custody agreement? How was life at your place? What does the new agreement consist of? More holidays at your house? An extra day or two at a time? Or extra weeks at a time? Will the kids remain in their schools or have to attend new schools? Are either parents in new relationships? Why did your son put a tracker on his moms phone? How long was it on there? What exactly did it track, for how long, and what happened when it was found? Did they only find out about the change due to the argument with their mother? What was said exactly? Do they argue a lot? I feel that there are so many aspects to this and it is hard to say without more information.", "NTA.. you are trying to help them", "NTA for the new custody arrangement and it\u2019s a really great thing that you and your ex wife are able to coparent so well as well as be on such good terms. \n\nThat said your 15yo son needs help. Free support groups, more sessions with the school counselor, a support system outside of you and his mom might help a bit-extended family could be good for this or his friends. \n\nMy concern is with his controlling behavior he\u2019s placing on his mother he clearly has some issue with feeling like he\u2019s unable to control his life therefor trying to control hers. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s tried to control others as well-his siblings, friends, any girlfriends/boyfriends if he\u2019s dating. This behavior can spiral out of control so so quickly. If you haven\u2019t already please speak to your ex wife about setting up meetings with the school counselor to chat about what\u2019s going on with him and how you can help at home as well. Whether it be a behavior plan with appropriate consequences to manage and mitigate this behavior before it starts to spiral more or setting up emotional and physical well-being check-ins with your child on a weekly/monthly basis so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to control others. Once you speak to them you may be able to give him more choices for his autonomy than he has now, so he can feel more in control of his own life. \n\nSchool therapists/counselors (in my experience, I work in an elementary school) don\u2019t have to follow the same confidentiality agreements as those outside of the school system. It may be different in HS but when I was that age (which was not long ago) it was not and they were actually required to talk to parents and call in any concerning behavior (suicidal ideation/self harm/accusations against other students or staff of bullying or physical-sexual assault). If you call them they may have some things to share that didn\u2019t require a call from them to you but will be helpful and by setting up a meeting you can form a plan on how to handle this and possibly seek more support like I mentioned above. \n\nBest of luck with this, I hope you and your ex wife can help each of your children during this time.", "NTA my parents are divorced and both my parents had a lot of respect for each other. We\u2019d only see our dad on weekends. When it was time with my dad even if we were in my moms house she\u2019d give us space to have time and if we ever really complained about our mom to our dad he\u2019d always make sure we never said anything disrespectful.

I mean, like I said, I know is hard but perhaps you need to knock on more doors... and then some more.

Please tell me yall Uninstalled it and explained how that's out of line unless the other person agrees.
