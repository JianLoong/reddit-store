Definitely odd that the child is the one tracking the parent, and a cause for concern. If you can't afford the therapy then something else must be done, if they all acting out like this.

Why do I mention this? Because maybe you could find cheaper therapy online from both the us or outside the country. Converting currencies is a good option, and I understand you need therapy for one kid and food for five people but perhaps try saving money in a more extreme way. Honestly, try permaculture, send your kids to babysit the neighbours... I don't know, my husband worked since he was 16 to help his parents, and he wasn't in a coal mine, just a superstore. I didn't had to help my parents but I was selling homemade cake door to door since I was 7, because I wanted money. I friend of mine started a bakery business when she found 5 dollars in the street and using for flour and butter.

Your oldest is 15, so they're ripe hormonal age for lashing out, but I would sit them down and ask them how they think their reactions made you feel. You and your spouse decided that an even split of seeing the children was fair to both parents, and their immediate response was to freak out over that? How are you supposed to take your children backlashing over seeing you an appropriate/fair amount of time?\n\nIt's rude of your children and incredibly insensitive to both parents in this situation.", "You're absolutely correct co dependant attachment issues need to be corrected ASAP...NTA ... look online for virtual resources", "Good for you wanting to spend more time with your children, more dads need to do this.
