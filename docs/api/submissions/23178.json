Whether it be a behavior plan with appropriate consequences to manage and mitigate this behavior before it starts to spiral more or setting up emotional and physical well-being check-ins with your child on a weekly/monthly basis so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to control others.

Rent/mortgage on the second residence would more than cover therapy!", "A 1 mile hike vs a 10 mile hike?", "Based on how many people are jumping to the idea that OP's wife must have cheated on him in this comment section and refusing to believe that the \"adventure\" thing could be the *real* reason for the divorce, I wouldn't be surprised if the son has heard all kinds of rumors about what \"actually happened,\" and is now repeating them.", "NTA, but I still don't understand. Was it that she just wanted to do road trips and hikes every weekend? I hate going out to do anything too, but that seems like a small price to pay to keep a marriage going when you got 3 kids. Oh well", "The point is if she has the money for these things but not her kids. That her priorities are fucked.  And you do wear out boots when you wear them often", "I haven't seen a Boondocks reference in a long time", "I totally get it because my spouse has the same dynamic. I get energy back by recharging at home, and spouse gets their energy back going ...literally anywhere else. That doesn't mean neither of us likes to do the other activity (I like the occasional trip and they like the occasional home movie night) but the difference is WAY too great and we don't have much overlap in how we relax and recharge. If I constantly do what they want I get tired and depressed, and the same vise versa. We basically just live different lives.\n\n... Anyway long story short I support OP's divorce, but some of those poor kids are so young! Leaving a partner is one thing but children are another. No wonder they're not taking it well.", "The son no longer attending therapy seems to be a recent development. It's most likely the mom bought her more expensive gear while the son was still able to attend therapy given this is a long-term hobby for her. In other words, that \"bid down payment\" probably occurred when insurance was still covering the son. The replacement gear for simple things like new boots isn't comparable to the cost for therapy.", "The tracker in the phone is WILD to me. Absolutely insane. It would never occur to me to put a tracker in my parents phones holy moly. NTA. But your son, that is so intense.

Is her free time spent nature walking and going on scenic drives?  Or is she hard core partying like a frat boy? \nHaving 50/50 custody is great as long as the kids are not living out of suitcases due to parental neglect or stubbornness. That has to be the worst childcare situation possible. \nYour oldest should not be speaking about his mother that way, especially if his opinion is based on Incel bullshit.  Going in a hike is not the same as hiking up your drawers for any guy in town.", "NTA but that's extremely weird and concerning that a 15 year old installed a tracker on *his mother's* phone. Does your ex know about the tracker or did he sneak around to put it on there?

Nothing about this story makes any sense at all.", "You may have people give you flak, but that dynamic is real and really difficult to reconcile. \n\nThat was what ended my last relationship. We talked of getting married. He was my best friend, had the same sense of humor and, had very similar mindsets. \nHowever the way we approached life was so drastically different. \n\nI live and breath getting up and going, checking out what's right around the bend, poking around. He needed 2 days notice to do anything. He needed structure, needed to know what the plans were ahead of time. Like if we were going out to dinner, he would have it in his head, right, dinner than home, and would be irritable if I wanted to then go for a stroll along the water. It just wasnt fun for either of us. \n\nIt was as simple as, a new grocery store opened in town, I'd immediately want to go check it out. He would want to go to the same restaurants, the same few places he loved. And on a daily basis, we both made each other slightly miserable trying to compromise.\n\nHe required the dishes and household chores to be done first before going out.(granted he did most of them) which would end up sucking up most of the morning, and prevent us from getting out the door. \n\nIt's just a way of approaching life. \nMy current partner we are opposites in many ways, but that curiosity really makes up a match. We make memories that we both cherish and that's what we bond over.\n\nMy ex really needed a fellow homebody, someone who enjoyed stability, organization, familiarity and routine. Someone who fits in their life and is their rock. \n\nIt took a long time for both of us to realize that we made each other miserable, that compromising every single day wasnt worth it.", "\u201cAlways\u201d wanted to go out or constantly faced pushback so it was rare that she *could* without guilt and drama? \n\nAnyway. Sounds manageable and you both decided it wasn\u2019t. With kids involved. ESH", "Again\u2026.how is an unmarried woman cheating \n\nShe likes hiking. Camping. Basic trips. \n\nIt costs barely anything compared to therapy. \n\nLet\u2019s do some math and basic logic eh", "You talk as if the mother has no choice or agency.\n\nThey got divorced because she wants more freedom, so how do you think he, or the son, can force her to spend more time with the kids when she doesn't want to?", "Unless she already had the gear.  Some of my gear wears out.  Some of it I've had since middle school and it still works great. It depends on the item, type of camping, and how things are maintained.", "but the time wasted out having \"freedom\" instead of making what's needed for your kid is a lot. if you have the time for constant trips. you have the time to make more for the kid that hate them now", "Assuming she is working, how is her second job going to fit in with her current job and time raising her children? Let's say she works day shift--she's either likely going to give up nights or weekends with her kids, the time they get to see her most. I don't think that's going to help with their mental health issues and adjusting to the divorce. It sounds like the trips she's taking aren't crazy week-long excursions, they're spontaneous weekend trips. Not to mention there's the burn-out factor. Working long hours with no me-time is terrible for your own mental health and *will* impact your parenting. I say this as someone who had a parent who worked around the clock to provide for us. He didn't just sacrifice his \"freedom.\" He sacrificed his relationship with his kids. You simply can't work that many  hours and still get quality parental time. And when he was off, he was so mentally and physically exhausted from working that he wasn't able to give us much energy. It's easy to say parents should just somehow make things happen, but the reality is much more complex. She could bust her butt at a second job to afford therapy, but the costs may not end up outweighing the benefit. After all, therapy isn't' a magic \"fix everything\" tool.

Apparently to him this all makes sense, and he's some kind of hero for having a four-bedroom place where they could decorate instead of, you know, maintaining a stable household or basic medical care for the child who was badly injured by the selfish choices of the adults who committed to his lifelong care.", "What I don't get is why everyone gives a shit.  They decided they weren't compatible and moved on in a mature and healthy manner, and reddit comments are trying to go back in time and fix a relationship that no longer exists.", "Op one suggestion : research a bit and write colleges/universities that offer the specialization as a licensed therapist describing the problem, your son s obsession and behavior and ask if there is anything available that could help you - by this I mean that while training/studying they need to practice. \n\nThe students might get credit points for 'practice' with your son/children, their work is always checked by the professors which are licensed and you might get your children therapy sessions for Free or for a minimal amount.\n\nSee if it's possible even for colleges /universities far away as nowadays it's quite common to have online sessions.

I do think, though, as a parent, there has to be more to it than what I want. For me, and I can handle the downvotes, this has to be about more than what the adults want, and there are clearly issues with the older kid that need addressing, and if therapy isn\u2019t on the table, forcing the issue could jeopardize the kid."]}
