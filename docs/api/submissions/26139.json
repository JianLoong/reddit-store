I\u2019m not saying I know her situation at all but I\u2019ve told her how I feel. She should know by now. \n\nSo a few nights ago, at the dinner table, I was saying something that happened during school that day and she blurted out, \u201cNobody cares!\u201d. Silence. I sighed and expressed my annoyance, clearly frustrated since she\u2019d interrupted me to be snarky. My mum saw the frustration in me and quietly told me, \u201cCome on, you know she has autism. You can\u2019t get mad at her, she doesn\u2019t know that this is wrong of her.\u201d And I just bursted.

But the same reason we wouldn\u2019t excuse an autistic man of groping a woman on impulse just because he\u2019s autistic, we wouldn\u2019t excuse an autistic woman being rude or belligerent.", "NTA. \n\nUnless she is severely low functioning with an intellectual disability (which it seems she is not), your parents are coddling her. She clearly understands it is rude and not nice to be like this to people but your parents let her get away with it. And what will happen when she acts like this as an adult and someone beats her up for opening her mouth too much? What will your parents do then?? Also them ignoring you is extremely immature. Your parents are adults, not high school kids. Yes, you shouldn\u2019t have shouted or called her a b- but it\u2019s very clear your parents don\u2019t teach her how to be social correctly. Autistic people who are coddled like this end up in prison or abused by people. \n\nI\u2019m autistic as well but not \u201cAsperger\u2019s\u201d/high functioning, I am on the lower functioning scale. Do I say things that are rude or insensitive? Yes, very often. But the difference is, when I am informed I apologise and try to improve. If someone treats me poorly or gets aggressive cause I was insensitive that\u2019s their issue and I won\u2019t apologise then. Though, your sister needs to be taught that her behaviour is anti social. \n\nSince your parents won\u2019t teach her from the looks of it, just ignore her. Pretend what she says isn\u2019t said, pretend she\u2019s not there and continue your conversations as normal. She might actually try to keep being rude on purpose because she wants the attention. But don\u2019t give her any attention, that\u2019s what she wants. Only reward the behaviour that is acceptable (not interrupting to say no one cares, being rude or calling you names) you can also say things like \u201cI only want to be friends with people who treat others kindly, not mean little girls who are rude all the time on purpose.\u201d Yes, she may cry, yes she might be hurt but sometimes everyone needs their feelings hurt. It\u2019s part of learning and growing up. Coddled autistics, just like coddled \u201cnormal\u201d people do not grow up well, they end up with no friends, no partner and most of all: no job. Because no one wants to be around someone who is rude and mean! sometimes we have to learn just cause we don\u2019t care what someone is saying, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to voice it and your parents are the ones who should be teaching her. Autists need to be taught this more so because they can become very anti social (that means their behaviour is shunned by society, not that they don\u2019t like to socialise). \n\nThe best thing you can do is ignore her and only reward her with attention when she\u2019s being kind, not mean.", "NTA, I absolutely hate it when parents are like \"they have autism/ADHD/etc.\" and basically enable their children to be AHs.  Your sister owes you an apology and so does your mom.", "NTA. There's no autistic justification for petty mean little digs at people, and I say this as the autistic mother of an autistic kid. She knows what she's saying - autistic does not equal stupid or even mentally handicapped. If she's genuinely upset, good, it means she's realized there are consequences to hurting other people's feelings for fun.\n\nYou can tell your parents from me that they're doing her a disservice by enabling her bullying, by acting as if being autistic means she's a pathetic little baby incapable of being asked to show basic kindness and decency to others, and by treating you as an acceptable scapegoat for her to take her frustration and anger and other bad feelings out on, or worse, an acceptable target to bully for her own amusement. And I'm serious here - they can wreck her life with this sort of enablement. My kid's been badly hurt by teachers who thought that autism = incapacity, and treated her like a mentally-handicapped little baby who didn't know what she was doing rather than a capable, intelligent person.\n\nFor Pete's sake, OP's parents, if she's \"still learning what's right and wrong to say,\" WHY THE F AREN'T YOU TEACHING HER? If she's still \"learning\" that at 13, if she doesn't \"know,\" that is YOUR FAILURE AS A PARENT. You should have taught her that YEARS ago, autistic or not. And what is worse, by not correcting her, and by punishing her sibling when they complain or get angry about being consistently and systematically bullied, you tell her that bullying is just fine, that she can use her autism as an excuse to pick on people and be nasty to people, and that you will not only allow it, you'll punish anyone who doesn't let her get away with it. Autistic or not, she is smart enough to see that bullying her sibling gets her coddled by you and gets her sibling punished - and so she is on  track to growing up to being a nasty little bully of an adult. Good job there.\n\nAnd quit resenting your other child for asking you to parent her sibling instead of coddling her, and for asking you to protect her from her bully rather than catering to her. You have a responsibility to all your kids.", "NTA you need to talk to a councilor at school or ask for family therapy. Dismissing rude comments and using the excuse of autism is poor parenting. Your sister & your parents are in for a rude awakening when she tries this on a classmate.", "NTA\n\n> She doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s saying\n\nBullshit. Unless she has comorbid intellectual deficit, she very likely knows. And even if she\u2019s doesn\u2019t, the behavior should be corrected same as any other child.\n\nShe\u2019s neurodivergent, not a dog or cat, she\u2019s likely as just generally intelligent as the next person and thirteen years is plenty long enough to learn the concept of not being a jerk. Provided one\u2019s parents aren\u2019t failing one, as yours are you.\n\nYour parents are enablers and this *will* come back to bite them, and more unfortunately, your sister in the ass soon enough.", "NTA. And don\u2019t  apologize, you\u2019re allowed to be upset. But it\u2019s not your responsibility to teach her empathy or how not to be awful. And when she turns out awful and no one  wants to be around her that\u2019s also won\u2019t be your problem. Stop engaging, fighting, teaching or whatever. Find other places to be. Other places where you can talk without being attacked.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has autism (though wasn't diagnosed until nearly 40 because you were just the quiet, sensitive girl with odd interests in the 80's), it sounds like your sister is taking advantage of having a 'get out of trouble free card.'  Is this behavior something she does at school, to classmates, teachers, or other family members?  If not, then she's targeting you to get a rise out of you and make you react so that you get scolded.\n\nBecause yeah, sometimes when I was younger I'd say something that would upset someone, but once I was told it did, I didn't say it again.  I understood that hurting people wasn't fun.", "NTA. Time to fight fire with some of your own. If she calls you stupid, give it right back to her.\n\n Shouldn't be an issue for your parents since if she 'does not understand' that its hurtful when she says it, then she wouldn't understand as well when used on her. \n\nCall them out on their hypocrisy if they have a problem with it.", ">\u201cCome on, you know she has autism. You can\u2019t get mad at her, she doesn\u2019t know that this is wrong of her.\u201d\n\nWhich is *why* she needs to hear that it's wrong. I don't know when I say something that's unintentionally offensive, so I appreciate when people let me know so that I can avoid saying it in the future. Is it frustrating to have to constantly memorize what's \"correct\" to say? Yeah. Is it also important for me to know that it's hurtful, so I don't hurt people's feelings accidentally. Your sister knows she's being hurtful because she's been told so many times. It's not an accident anymore. She's just learned she can get away with it because \"autism\"", "NTA, she can\u2019t learn what\u2019s right and wrong if no one is explaining it to her.", "Nta do not apologize.  Give them the same treatment back. Sis now knows she can get away with treating you bad. She will continue.  If your parents won't protect you then you have no choice but to protect yourself. Avoid them all. They will see you standing up for yourself for a change.  It will take them time to understand that you will not be treated this way anymore.  Chances are after a bit they will come around. Stand up for yourself when no one else will. It is your only option.  Otherwise you will be your sister's punching bag for life. What will it be?  Up to you? Been there done that.", "NTA. OP please show this thread to your parents. They are allowing your sister to verbally and emotionally abuse you. Do not back down. Do not apologize. They owe YOU an apology.", "NTA for almost everything, but you didn't have to throw the word \"fat\" in there.

Allowing her to be rude and making excuses for her is not going to help her in the long run.", "NTA. She absolutely knows that what she is saying is hurtful.

Like you, people outside of the bubble your family has happily built around your sister will not give a fuck about her autism when she shows herself to be a brat, it will quickly become a lame excuse and she will be ostracized.

That's shitty and unsupportive of them, while your sister will have her struggles, that doesn't mean you should have your experience of her behaviour written off as something you can just brush off. You haven't mentioned your age and that would change what I'd expect them to say, but they should have some compassion.\n\nThe difficulty with autism is that sometimes a person can look for all the world like they're perfectly capable/aware, but they may genuinely not be, or they may be aware but not be able to stop the behaviour. I'm speaking as an autistic person who has never behaved like your sister, but it sounds like she may just have different struggles to me.\n\nThink back - is it often around a particular time of day such as after school that she does this more? Has the behaviour got worse since she's feeling with puberty hormones? It may be that she's been like a bottle feeling shaken up and ready to explode all day, home is the place she feels safe and she just can't mask anymore. So her behaviour can seem really off the hook and like \"well if she can talk to others ok, why not at home\" - the context matters. If she has to mask even at home, that could lead to significant mental health difficulties later and often does for autistic woman/girls.\n\nDoes that mean you should have to just sit and take it? No, but it shouldn't mean she is shamed for it. You need to have a plan with your parents for what you should do if she's feeling unregulated. Can you leave till she's able to speak in a respectful way? This does rely on your parents working with her on trying to find other outlets though. They need to come up with something that means home can feel secure for both of you.\n\nCalling someone a derogatory insult just isn't ok regardless. You should apologise in my opinion, yes.

(Not likely, but not 100% impossible) How exactly is your sister supposed to LEARN that these kinds of remarks are mean and not acceptable to say if no one ever talks to her about them? If your mom really thinks what she is saying, the proper response would be to talk with your sister about how these things make others feel and give suggestions about other things to say instead.

This scenario is pretty familiar - I think that autistic kids often genuinely don't get it, but if they always get a negative response to their antisocial remarks, they eventually figure out the relationship between what they say and how much people (don't) want to spend time with them. They may never figure out that what they say is actually hurtful, but they learn to stop doing it. \n\nSo in a way your parents are right, they just have the wrong response to your sister's unpleasant behaviour.", "NTA but you do need an ally.

Unfortunately, your parents don't actually seem to know what having autism involves? So they're using it as a catch-all for every bad behavior your sister has that they don't know how to parent.

You just served her a little of her own behavior back to her.

I have horrid impulse control (I do take meds, but it doesn\u2019t help that much with my impulses), and I blurt out things that a \u201cNormal\u201d person wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m around the same age as your sister (a little older), and to me, she sounds like an asshole (like you said). maybe our difference in behavior is because I was undiagnosed for a while (I was diagnosed at the age of 8 or 9), and my parents taught me like a normal person, which was a little more difficult for me. I think that no matter the mental disorder (unless it\u2019s actually dangerous, or untreatable) people should be treated like normal people, but they should also be taught like normal people (maybe with a little extra help), so they can learn social skills and cues (to avoid situations like this).", "NTA I\u2019m getting tired of horrendous behavior being excused in the name of Autism.

He completely understands if we tell him a word is mean.", "NTAH, your sister is hiding behind her disability.", "I mean, NTA, but I feel like your sister having autism is a bit of a red herring here.  She's 13.  Lots of folks are complete jerks to their siblings at 13.\n\nReally, your sister isn't to blame for acting liek a teenager, your parents are for making excuses.", "NAH,  this is a tough situation. This is going to be long.\n\nYou're not an AH to feel frustrated and angry.\n\nIt's pretty common, in my limited experience, for neurotypical siblings to believe that their autistic siblings are more capable than they actually are.  (Teachers, too, by the way). And it's pretty common for parents to believe that their autistic kids are less capable than they actually are.\n\nSo that leaves a situation where no one is the most knowledgeable, and no one agrees with each other, and there is no one person that fully understands their autistic loved one.\n\nUnfortunately it leaves you in a situation where you feel stressed, not believed, and treated unfairly.\n\nThe bad news:  you cannot force your sister to behave differently. You parents probably can't either, unless they try some kind of therapy with her. If you and them repeatedly telling her to stop hasn't worked thus far, you have to accept that it won't work in the future.  If they have the resources and if she is amenable (very few 13-year-olds are) then they should try therapy. But this might not be possible.\n\nThe good news: you can't control her behaviour, but you can control your own.  Seek therapy for yourself, if possible.  Learn more about your sister's situation to increase your understanding of it. Reduce your interactions with her for a while and spend more time taking care of yourself and doing things that you enjoy.  Take that anger and frustration and direct it toward self care as much as you can.  Tell your parents how her behaviour is affecting your feelings and your stress levels, and problem-solve with them about how they can help you and support you.\n\nAt age 13, my autistic kid was constantly rude and basically impossible and had almost no ability to understand or care about the effect of his actions on other people.  He's just a few years older now, and it's finally starting to change.  He is finally beginning to be able to see things from another point of view. Sometimes he even catches himself when he has said something unhelpful  (or worse) and apologizes right away.  We can have actual conversations now -- sometimes.  That would have been inconceivable five years ago, or even three. In our situation, he was violent, to the point that I feared for my safety and was afraid to leave him alone.  Starting at around age 16, though, his brain started to mature, somehow, and things gradually got better.  I'm not saying that he's suddenly a model of perfect social skills -- far from it! --  but I'm no longer afraid of him or what he will do, and I am now able to work together productively with him to solve problems.  Not always, but often.\n\nI'm not saying that your sister will follow the same path. Every kid with autism is different.  I'm just saying that, although times are tough for you right now, there is at least one family out there in the world that experienced something similar to what you're going through when their loved one was 13, and things got better for them.  It's possible that things will get better for your family, too.\n\nHang in there, OP.  Lots of hugs.", "NTA. \n\nAgree with other commenters. It\u2019s better to hear it from a relative than a stranger who could potentially give her a rude awakening / extreme reality check. She needs to be held accountable and understand that she cannot go through her life running her mouth and talking shit all the time. She could catch someone when they\u2019re having a bad day, call them a name and that person could lose their shit on her.\n\nShe needs to be taught not to say this stuff before it has serious repercussions later on down the road, and your parents get calls from school, hospitals, police stations, that their daughter was in a fight or in trouble because she called someone a name and they retaliated. Not everyone will put up with this like your parents have. End it now, for her sake.", "NTA.  Autism is not a free pass to be an AH but your parents are allowing that.  I am sorry you have to deal with this.  Good for you for standing up for yourself.  IF she is truly upset, maybe she will understand that what she has been doing is wrong.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't INSTINCTIVELY know. She needs more explicit explanations than the average kid, that doesn't mean she's incapable of understanding what hurtful behavior looks like.\n\nYou are allowed.tomsay \"hey, sister, that's hurtful. And one of those.things we don't actually say to other people because it's NOT funny, it's just mean.\"\n\nThere's also nothing to say that, once she understands, she will care. ASD doesn't prevent someone from ALSO being an asshole, it just means you have to explicitly clarify before you assume they are. \n\nPull your parents aside and ask them to do some reading or talk to the pediatrician or a therapist about how to support a child with autism, and how to teach healthy boundaries. What they are teaching her currently is that she's allowed to say whatever she wants, and that's the opposite of helpful.", "NTA. Autistic girl here.

Oh i forgot you dont have those. Repeat every time til it stops. If your parents get mad jist shrug and say if she stops ill stop.
