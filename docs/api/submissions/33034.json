They hear you. They remember.\n\nYou may have forgiven Will. That's fine. Jess hasn't. She remembers how you were treated. She remembers how you were hurt. She doesn't want that memory at her wedding. That's completely reasonable and understandable.\n\nIf you're not able to understand her perspective on this, and set aside your feelings for *one day* to honor her, then that's on you.\n\nIf you can't be apart from Will for one day, then I don't think this relationship is as healthy as you claim it is.", "YTA You\u2019ve known your friend for 12 years and it\u2019s the happiest day of her life - a once in a lifetime (hopefully) day, her wedding and you won\u2019t attend because you want to \u2018stand by your man\u2019 who cheated on you. The ultimate betrayal. Yet you\u2019ll throw away a 12 year friendship over him? GIRL!!", "YTA for expecting people to tolerate someone who treated you bad. He hasn't earned their trust or respect back so they don't want him to attend, that is their prerogative. You can take him back after he cheated but nobody else has to accept him back. Jess can support you but she doesn't have to support your relationship.\n\nYou have to decide if you want to throw away an important person who has been a loyal friend to you for 12 years over someone who isn't loyal to you and cheated 3 months ago. I personally think you're choosing the wrong person in this situation and you'll hurt Jess by not going. \n\nIf he is trying to show you that he loves you and is sorry, he would support you attending and realise that his actions have consequences.", "Thank you to everyone who commented. It was harsh but I needed to hear it. I understand now that if I bail on her I am the asshole so I plan on speaking with my partner tonight. If I can figure out how to do an update I will in the morning.", "YTA because she clearly knew what was going on, there for you in the situation. And if he cheated and then treated you badly? In your words \u201cthings are getting better\u201d they aren\u2019t okay right now. \nPlus every cheater changes that first time they get caught.\nAnd if she\u2019s anything like my husband and I we don\u2019t associate with cheaters. Because as a married couple, we don\u2019t associate with  people who don\u2019t respect or their partner enough to simply stay faithful. \n\nHard YTA for choosing a cheater over the biggest day in your friends life. When your fianc\u00e9 chose to behave in a way that would make him unwelcome around people who care about you", "Jess loves you, she was angry on your behalf when your fiance cheated on you. \n\nYou said in the comments that he was so hurt over being left out that he cried. \n\nHe's manipulating you to separate you from the friend who sees through his bullshit. How is he going to keep cheating, if Jess is there to keep an eye on him? Because YOU obviously won't hold him accountable. \n\nYTA, for choosing to not support your best friend so you can coddle your cheating boyfriend. Ugh.", "You can do whatever you want of course. But Will should support you going to the wedding and you\u2019re choosing Will over your friend. Are you ready to accept the consequences of that decision?", "YTA -  Most people would love to have a friend that has their best interest at heart. Not you though. You\u2019re willing to throw your friendship in the trash over a man that cheated on you. If you skip your friend\u2019s wedding, your friendship will never be the same (and could possibly be over). That\u2019s a high price to pay for someone who may cheat on you again. And if Will was any type of changed man, he\u2019d be pushing you to go to this wedding because he\u2019d understand that this is part of the price he has to pay to fix your relationship.", "She can choose to uninvite him.  You can choose to not go.  Then the choices become whether or not your friendship remains.", "YTA.\n\nI'm not with the \"cheaters never change\" camp; it is possible when they are held accountable and take the time to work on themselves and heal relationships. But it can be quite a burden to help a friend shoulder the trauma of an abusive relationship only to have a lot of your support (and time, emotions, resources) invalidated when they go running back. What it communicates is that (a) *you* are part of the problem and not willing to change/grow with their help, and (b) the amount of drama that overflows into their life apparently is just presumably water under the bridge that neither you nor your partner have to clean up.\n\nI'm not saying she can't come to forgive your fiance, but you should not be expecting that to come easily based on *your* judgment. There is some owning up both you and the fiance have to do with her before she will trust him again (and honestly it sounds like her trust in you may be on the rocks).", "Of course she's not going to pay for a whole-ass reception meal for this skeevy man, come ON. YTA.", "She stood by you while you were reeling from his betrayal. She was there when he went straying. She will not forget the hurt and pain you went through.\n\nShe has every right to not want a man who hurt her friend there. \n\nConsider this - if you choose him over her and skip the wedding, will she be there for you if he strays again and you need a friend? \n\nShe was there for you. How and WHEN will you be there for her, if not on this one day? Working through his cheating doesnt mean that you pretend it didn't happen. Are you going to pretend like she wasn't there for you? \n\nYTA", "You are just afraid that he will cheat on you while you are at the wedding. YTA\n\nYou are choosing a cheating asshole over someone who has been there through thick and thin for years. If you don't go to the wedding she will never forgive you, as she should. Who will be there to pick you up when Will cheats on you again if you push away Jess?", "Yes, YTA - you're choosing a cheating, lying guy over a friend of 12 years because she didn't like how he treated you? And you're defending him? Gross. She should cut you out permanently", "YTA for thinking a cheater will ever change. If he was willing to loose you why would he value you? You\u2019re risking an amazing friendship over a man who clearly does NOT deserve it.", "YTA.  Gee, a whole three months ago! How could she not be okay with how he treated you. And after all, he did pay for her forgiveness.\n\nYou are clinging to the hope that your STB ex-fiance can change because you are afraid to be alone.\n\nYour friend could not enjoy her wedding while having to see someone who caused you so much pain. It would be an open mockery of marriage. \n\nSix months or a year from now, you'll be crying because you missed your friend's wedding for this looser.  And you'll regret it for the rest of your life.", "YTA. \n\nA lot of friends sometimes observe things love makes us blind to. Granted, sometimes they can be wrong. But you don\u2019t throw away a friendship over somebody who has already hurt you. \n\nI know you want to believe he magically and instantly changed, but that takes years of rebuilt trust to prove right", "YTA.\n\nFirst, no one who has strong morals wants someone who will cheat on their SO to be in their circle. EVER! Cheaters can change but not in 3 months, and it takes a long time for anyone with a strong moral compass to forgive and begin to build trust. It's going to take years before people begin to believe he is a good person again. \n\nYou can believe what you want about your partner, but he has said exactly what he knows you want to hear to keep you. Being excluded seems like the only consequence he is facing for his transgressions. That's why he's reacting emotionally. He's crying because he's upset that his actions have consequences, and he's upset he can't just manipulate everyone to love him again like he did you. \n\nYou are metaphorically giving your bestie the finger by choosing him over her special day. Everyone around you probably already thinks you're weak with questionable morals and decision-making. Blowing off this wedding will only reinforce that his manipulation is controlling your decision-making.", "NAH. Jess isn't an AH for not wanting a cheater and someone who hurt someone she cares about at her wedding. You can not attend if you really want to \"show solidarity\" with this man, but don't be surprised when he cheats again and Jess is no longer your friend because you chose this unreliable man over her.\n\nETA - Jess is in no way in the wrong here, imo. You and Will are the AHs if there are any. Will sounds like he is one regardless of this situation.", "YTA you know this is a ride or die when she is telling you this man is crap.  She has known you for 12 years and has she ever given you reason to doubt her loyalty.  How long have you known your fiance? He has already broken your trust and you still stayed.  I think you need to reconsider what you want in your life.", "YTA - you\u2019re a doormat Op, and you are going to end up trapped in your awful marriage because you cut off the people who mattered for a manipulative asshole.", "YTA \n\nWhy Will isn\u2019t stepping up and insisting you still attend is beyond me. After all he did cheat on you and Jess stepped up as support during your \u201crough patch.\u201d He should be owning what he did and recognizing people will view him differently for a good while.", "YTA. Cheaters cannot stand up for a couple who are pledging their lives to each other. And she's your friend.", "YTA\n\n1. 3 Months ago is not enough time to say \"He's genuinely changed\" \n2. You might be willing to forgive Will easily, but you vented to your friend about how hurt you were. That doesn't suddenly change. It would be in the realm of friendship ender if you choose your cheating partner over me.\n3. I wouldn't want someone who is an active cheater at my wedding either.", "YTA - seeing him, may ruin her vibe. It's HER wedding, be there for her, she was there for you.", "YTA. Your friend has been with you through thick and thin. I detested attending my best friend\u2019s wedding because she got married to a cheater despite everyone\u2019s objections, but everyone showed up for her. Her marriage broke down a few years later, but that\u2019s another story. \n\nWill needs to put on his big boy pants and realise that even if you\u2019ve forgiven him, your friends don\u2019t have to and he should deal with being left out because this is YOUR friendship, not his. Friends always remember.\n\nBy not attending, you risk giving up an amazing friendship to stand in solidarity with a cheater who \u2018cries because he was feeling left out\u2019. Feels like an attempt to alienate you from your friend. Are you going to stop hanging out with everyone who doesn\u2019t like him?", "YTA - just because YOU forgave him, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to. your friend saw you at your lowest, she saw what HE put you through, she saw how he didn\u2019t show you any respect or love when he cheated on you. your friend loves you and when someone hurts the ones we love, we hold on to that. no matter how much he has \u2018changed\u2019 your friend will always see him as the one who hurt her best friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some people allow plus one for some of their guests, so in many times they don't know who actually would be at their wedding. Especially when they are like 200 guests. Op and her friend are very close and that is the only difference.", "If rewards were still a thing you would get one", "\ud83e\udd72", "THIS. \u2b06\ufe0f", "We spoke and he is hurt to be left out so much so he was crying", "It's your business when the person who was wronged is your best friend of 12 years and you've likely been a shoulder to cry on because their partner wronged them. I think it's totally reasonable for Jess to not want OP's cheating boyfriend attending her wedding. She's had to be there for OP when this guy hurt her and she probably hates him.", "Left out?  What kind of a relationship did he have with her before this to where he'd feel left out?   Is he just your +1?", "Did he cry every time he had sex with other woman? Did he use his tears to get you to forgive every time he did the horizontal tango anyone but you? He caused his own pain. He did this to everyone involved.", "He's being manipulative. It's not that he can't feel bad -- he *should* feel bad -- but it seems like he's shifting the story so it's all about your mean friend hurting his feelings. Very classic tactic. \"Sure, what I did was bad, but the *reaction* is the real problem.\"\n\nHow'd you find out about the cheating? Did he tell you, or did you discover it yourself?", "\u201cHe is hurt to be left out so much he was crying\u201d\n\nOh come on, girl, you HAVE to see that that is him manipulating you.", "Manipulative af. Will sounds like a real piece of work.", "Yeah but being left out is a *consequence* of his behavior. \n\nHe cheated. If he was truly sorry about what happened he would understand that there are consequences beyond the two of you. \n\nInstead he is trying to make himself a victim.", "It's the consequences of his actions, he has to earn their respect and trust back and that hadn't been done. Why is he hurt when he was the person who created the mess in the first place?", "I can see why Will cheated on you\u2026. You are so easily to be manipulated and you gonna choose someone over someone who you said you like is like a sister to you\u2026 ain\u2019t no men is that worth losing 12 year relationship over. Especially someone who can cheat on you and acting like they\u2019re the victim .", "Yeah? He wasn't hurt when he cheated? \n\nHe DESERVES to be left out. And honestly, you're a shitty friend for this. She doesn't want a cheater around on her wedding and Will should acknowledge what he did was horrible.", "Aww poor guy, he should call his other gf for more support.  crazy that you're picking a cheater over your \"sister\"", "Manipulate much?\n\nThis dude \"recently\" cheated, told you he'd changed and is now pushing you away from your friends.\n\nWinner. Keep making good choices OP!", "this is his own doing sorry to be blunt", "So, he doesn't sound like a very great guy and liket his relationship will last. Do you want to maybe lose him OR lose her AND probably him just a lil bit later?", "Well if it isn't the consequences of his own actions. At least someone is holding him accountable", "Will doesn't sound very mature and his lack of understanding of how his actions impact others, (not just you), is worrying. Look, I'm sorry to have to say this but the chances are that he will cheat again and you'll have trashed a friendship for nothing. And him crying? Pure manipulation on his part and a red flag, don't ignore it.", "Why? Was he really close with Jess? Or is he hurt that his behavior has consequences?", "This is the consequence of his actions and he should just suck it up.", "He sounds manipulative.", "You are going to regret forgiving him, we can all see it; your friend can see it, I\u2019m really sad you can\u2019t", "Unfortunately those are the consequences of his actions.", "Will nobody think of Will's feelings? /s\n\nDude's a cheater. Your friend cares about the crying he caused you. Good for her.", "I had a friend with a terrible guy, I didn't love him at all, but I respected her decision. I advised her, she didn't listen to me, so I let her do what she wanted and she quickly realized what he was like. People have to figure things out for themselves. OP's friend will achieve nothing with this step", "He was close with her as well when we started dating I actually I\u2019d say they had their own friendship as well", "Crocodile tears, more like!", "Turns out people don\u2019t like to be friends with cheaters. Will sounds like a shitty person who is finally seeing some consequences for it, even if they aren\u2019t coming from you as they should.", "And what do you suppose Jess would say? Because it doesn't sound like she feels that way.", "Jess has decided that she no longer wants to have a friendship with him, which, quite frankly, is justified. The infidelity may have been done to you, but it also communicates something about his character and morals to his friends. That, and the fact he seems to have treated you badly in the aftermath, means she has decided that she doesn\u2019t want to be associated with him any more. That\u2019s her choice. \n\nYou can choose to forgive him, but you can\u2019t force her to overlook the fact she no longer trusts him as a friend and doesn\u2019t want to associate with him. Sounds like you should trust Jess\u2019 judgment of his character more than yours.", "She disinvited one of her close friends because she no longer considers him such. This isn't about your active relationship with a dude, it is about how someone she thought of as a friend behaves and her decision to no longer wish to associate with him. The fact that the person he hurt happens to also be a close friend just makes it worse.\n\nAlso, this is her wedding; people often do not wish to tokens of infidelity at such a celebration. YTA", "So she's willing to put you over her 'close' 'friend'.  Interesting.", "It\u2019s entirely possible she did at one time. But when Will showed who he was, she believed it."]}
