She\u2019s never had mom relationship and this to her is like winning the lottery. I\u2019d just keep my mouth shut around the ex . If there\u2019s things you want to talk about with your daughter definitely do privately and encourage her to come to you with questions.

We've seen several versions of this story here multiple times. When it's the mom saying the dad is a deadbeat and ran out, she's congratulated.

You've done an awesome job raising your kid, but I would not, ever, badmouth your kids' mother in front of her, even though she deserves it a thousand times over. Let your kid figure out her Mom was irresponsible. And be prepared for her to be angry at \\*you\\* even though it's not your fault, because you're the safe parent. It seems unfair, but that's how teenagers are sometimes. They can take their anger out on you rather than the unstable parent because they know you'll always be there for them.", "Your daughter being a teenager is looking for the best-case scenario for why her mother abandoned her, and she's going to want to see it in a pleasant way and not the way that makes her mother a self-absorbed person. It's understandable that you would want your daughter to know the truth right off, but keep in mind that, her mother, given enough time, will show her true colors and your daughter will be able to come to that conclusion on her own given time. Plus, your daughter loves you deeply and you're her safe space to lash out at during this difficult situation. Give her understanding and time and all will be revealed.", "NTA, but neither is your daughter. She's an insecure teenager (due to her mom) and took it out on the safe parent who will be there at the end of the day regardless. \n\nDon't compare them as it's not fair on your daughter.\n\nBite your tongue a bit as right now as your daughter will have rose tinted glasses on and if you step in, she'll be angry at you. Let her come to her own conclusions. \n\nIt does sound like she picked up you're not keen on meeting her mum and then you made a negative comment and then left so your daughter may feel you're trying to sabotage the relationship so apologise, let her know you were just worried as you love her and you'll be there for her.", "NTA \nI understand 100 percent being pissed at the mom for walking in now that you did all the hard work. \n\nHowever if you keep this attitude up you will loose your daughter. Let me explain. Right now your daughter is excited she is getting her mother back. She is getting the one thing she has spent her life dreaming of. Right now your daughter is just excited that her mom wants to be in her life. All little kids want their parents love. By bashing her mom your pushing her into her moms arms.\n\nSo I would suggest you and your daughter both get counseling. You to deal with the anger issues you have with your ex. Because hey no judgment I be angry as hell too. She walked away how dare she come back now! I understand. But you need an outlet that you can vent too. Someone to help you navigate this with your daughter with out letting that anger consume you and push the child you raised away.\n\nYour daughter needs counseling so she can talk about the feelings she can\u2019t talk about with you. She can\u2019t tell you she missed her mom. She can\u2019t tell you that the anger you are showing is making her feel guilty to get to know her mom. She also needs a therapist to help her set boundaries with her mom so her mom doesn\u2019t bull doze herself into your daughters life and hurt her again.\n\nBut what you do not need to do is argue, make sarcastic comments, push, guilt your daughter about her mom. You will push your daughter away. Trust you raised your daughter right. She will be able to see through the bull shit. Get her the therapist to help her work through her emotions and help her set boundaries. But do not give your ex the satisfaction of driving a wedge between you and the child you raised.  If this goes south and mom leaves again your daughter needs to know she can come to you and you won\u2019t say I told you so. You will just be the shoulder she cry\u2019s on.\n\nSo take 5 minutes. But your sincerest smile on go upstairs apologize to your daughter. Tell her your sorry. And discuss going to therapy and how with all these big changes you feel she needs someone neutral to talk to. Tell her you are going to go to. \n\nBut honestly do not let your hatred of mom cause you to loose your child! This will push her away and make mom the victim because she will say you kept her from the daughter", "Soft YTA. I totally understand\u00a0how you feel being that she ran off and you raised your daughter by yourself, and now she comes back around for the fun stuff. That being said, you're only going to push your daughter away if you don't support her trying to develop a relationship with your mom. Vent to your friends, see a therapist, and bite your tongue. You can tell your daughter the true story but any other badmouthing is just going to hurt your daughter", "You were expected to have a meeting with someone you are not on speaking terms with. It was bound to go wrong. It sounds like your daughter didn't realise you do know her mother well enough and that you do have a history together.\n\nAs others pointed out: it wasn't about you. It was about your daughter. But I understand that you couldn't let her lie to your daughter.\n\nI get your daughter, too. She wanted to give her mom a fair chance.\n\nNAH, except the mother...", "Argh, hard to make a judgement on this one. You are basing your anger on the actions of a 16 (?) yo girl. If you love your daughter, and clearly you do, you would want her to at least try to have a relationship with her mother. I never met my father until I was 17, and I yearned for that fatherly connection my whole life up until I met him and was able to have a relationship with him. \n\nMy mother HATED him, but she never said a single bad word about him to us (three siblings) until we were well into adulthood. She would even send us birthday cards during our childhood pretending they were from our father.\n\nIf you continue to behave how you are about your ex you will hand her your daughter on a plate. Just be wise about this. Be supportive and then be there to pick up the pieces if she (the ex) ends up showing what you believe are her true colours.", "ESH - although OP a lot less.\n\nI'm the child of a similar situation, only genderswapped and my parents were mid twenties.\n\nThe only thing my mother would ever say about my father was that some people aren't ready to have kids. Mine just figured it out a little late.\nHe showed up when I was 15. My mom supported me when I wanted to meet him and when I decided I didn't want to see him anymore. She made sure that all of it was my choice.\nAnd it wasn't until after, she told me the hell he put her through when he left.\n\nI will never stop to admire and love her for the strength that must have taken.\nBut I am so glad she let me experience and define my relationship with him without trying to influence me and I think your daughter deserve the same thing.\n\nTrust that you have raised her right.", "While I understand your anger, YTA. You took something away from your daughter by turning this into your opportunity to have a petty pissing match. It was really inappropriately timed. You should've stood back and let your ex and your daughter have the talk they needed to have.", "YTA.  This meeting was supposed to be about your daughter, and instead you made it about you.", "I think you missed a big opportunity. If you hadn\u2019t taken over the conversation, and instead listened, you\u2019d be in a much stronger position to communicate with Peyton about this. You also stomped on her chance to communicate with her mom, which is something she clearly wanted to do. For doing that to your daughter, YTA. \n\nJust to be clear, her mom is big self-serving AH. But that\u2019s obvious, and not what you\u2019re asking about. By making it about you, you missed the chance to let Peyton see who her mom is, or the chance for you to aware and provide context when necessary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have to let them have a conversation without turning it into another fight if that is what your daughter wants.  \nTry to imagine it from your daughter's point of view, your angry at her mother, but your daughter is angry, confused, conflicted and its not unreasonable for to want to at least talk to her mother.", "YTA. You could've just said no. It's (in my opinion) a LOT easier to not go and explain why you don't want to go, and you don't want to ruin it. If she didn't know what happened between your relationship, offer to explain it after, so she isn't late.

Better her to leave than stay around and be neglectful/resentful of her daughter. Honestly that was probably the best decision she could have made for her kid at the time. She is kind of an asshole for going about reconnecting this way though. From the conversation it seems she's not taking accountability and trying to play the victim. \n\nAt the same time your daughter deserves the right to get to know her mother now and have a relationship with her if she so desires. It's painful for you I know, but you need to give her that option.

Never bothered to send a card.", "And that's true. Nobody is denying that your ex could have done a lot of things way before now. But then again, maybe she couldn't...\n\nBut this is not about your ex. This is about Peyton and about what she wants. \n\nAnd Peyton is only 16. Right now, all she cares about is having a mother. She doesn't give a shit about the how and why she didn't grow up with one. \n\nYou think this is hard for you. This is 100X more hard for Peyton because she's going to be on a rollercoaster of emotions with her relationship with her mother. \n\nWhat your daughter needs, and that's the only thing that matters here, is your support in building a relationship with her mother. She sure as hell doesn't need you to vomit your hate about her mother. \n\nI repeat so that your understand : this is not about you and this is not about your ex.
