Good on your 13yo for correcting her, but it\u2019s also possible that if your child is the only person informing her of this, she may not be taking it seriously. That sucks but a lot of people brush off kids\u2019 input.\n\nI\u2019m leaning Y-T-A right now simply because *if* your MIL knows that baby\u2019s middle name is in honor of someone on your side of the family, it\u2019s a somewhat natural (not saying correct) assumption that if their first name is pronounced the same, perhaps it is in honor of her.", "I'm confused. Why are you so angry at this woman for thinking her new grandbaby with the same name as her was named after her/feeling good about it? Why did you just not speak to her instead of putting immense effort into humiliating her with a weird baby announcement?", "YTA Unless you have a good reason to dislike your MIL. How awkward and unnecessary to give a grandchild the same name just to point out that she was definitely not named after them ... Comes across as an intended slight.", "Your oldest child was mirroring your emotions about something that is trivial - I'd encourage you to examine what sort of things are spoken about in front of her for the sake of fostering a respectful and loving relationship with her grandmother. \n\nYou couldn't think of a name but ultimately decided on one that is the same as your mil's.  Then act like you are the sad victim of some egregious action by her when she points out the obvious.", "NTA she should\u2019ve stopped when she was first informed she wasn\u2019t the person the baby was named after", "YTA. Your husband is right, and I bet you instill your oldest against MIL. You sound like a lovely DIL. Plus, great choice of name knowing it would cause issues by blatantly saying \u201coh no, I would never name her after you\u201d. Could at least say it was named after both ladies, idk. You all like to pick beef with your in-laws just because", "NTA she was told repeatedly.", "NTA", "YTA.\n\nWould it hurt you to let MIL be happy about this?\n\nWhat you did was performative, rude and unnecessary.", "NTA good on you for doing something about what she was saying", "NTA, if you'd named her after your MIL you'd have spelled it the same lol. 10/10 for putting her right.", "I have the same name as an older cousin of mine and they think I was named after them but I\u2019m not.

Even his kids can see what he's doing is BS.", "So what if she likes her version?  It\u2019s not hurting anyone.  Now you have bad blood over something unimportant.", "ESH , imo mostly you . It doesn't really matter that she's telling ppl the baby is named after her does it ? Do her or her friends/family even ever come in contact with the actual lady you named her after ? Seems pretty harmless on MIL part ,comes off as she's just excited to share the name .also why wouldn't  you just sit down and talk to her about it?? Only your kids did and then you played the social media game instead of talking to her yourself .", "YTA, you gave your daughter the MIL's name, and she has the audacity to think you named your daughter after her?!\n\nThis is ridiculous. You're really putting a lot of work in to hurt your MIL. She's your husband's mom. Show some respect. \n\nThis reads like a middle schooler playing petty popularity games. You named your daughter after someone you looked up to. It's also the name of her grandma. What a beautiful multi-layered name with lots of meaning. Instead of embracing it you're using it to cause division in the family", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also why do your kids talk like that about their 70 year old grandma. You sound rude and petty and so do your kids. If this is what you worry about.. go volunteer or something. Also maybe teach your kids better manners. You all seem quite mean", "Sounds like you and your kids need to find something better to occupy your time with. Who really cares, and you're really going to allow your children to treat their grandparent that way? It only bothers all of you because you want a reason to fight with your MIL, these are measly ramblings of an old women and you and your kids are wasting your life away fighting over dumb shit like this. This behavior is not badass. You need to teach your daughter to learn her place and stay there. That whole \"My sister\" spew is just an excuse to act shitty in winning her daddy's approval in treating her mother's mother, like shit and overstepping her boundaries as a child. Stop allowing your children to fight your battles like a coward. Meanwhile, your baby is growing up unnoticed because the entire family is too busy fighting with grandma over your name.

She\u2019s been corrected (by a 13 yr old no less) on multiple occasions and obviously needed a big flashing sign to get it through her skull.", "There is a sense of hate toward the MIL that even comes through from the daughter, \u201c\u2026tell her to shut up.\u201d That\u2019s a horrible way to speak about a grandparent.", "OP is separated from her husband so she probably doesn't give a crap about her in-laws opinions anymore", "The linked post and this one are from the same account.", "she said her children told mil?", "Oh I see when I looked it showed me something else", "That\u2019s why I commented requesting more info but OP has a post in another sub about being a single mom so I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re a reliable narrator.
