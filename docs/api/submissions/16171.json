Work on your kids issues before it becomes a real problem. This isn't a cautious issue, it's a superiority issue.", "ESH. She should have sent invites in the mail, so that your daughter wouldn't be hurt in all of this.

However, that is a lesson for you to teach, not for her to be hurt over.", "YTA\n\nThat rule is stupid. Mailing them is not going to stop kids from finding out they weren't invited or prevent hurt feelings, particularly in a small town.\n\nTime for some self-reflection, your daughter learned this behavior from you and it is doing her no favors. There is a difference between following rules and feeling like you have to be the one enforcing them. Poor little 1st grader is wound pretty tight.  Deal with that before starting fights with other parents.", "YTA\n\nCan\u2019t imagine where your daughter gets her attitude from\u2026\u2026 Maybe your daughter is this girls bully so why would she invite your daughter if that\u2019s the case?\n\nYou made a teachable moment worse by calling the other parent, You should be sitting your daughter down and teaching her how to treat people properly", "YTA\n\nWhile the other kids mom shouldn't have referred to your daughter as a bossy buzzkill, it does make sense NOT to invite her. Sad as that is to say.\n\nIts a painful way to learn a lesson.\n\nKids don't like \"tattlers\" or kids who are \"bossy\". Neither do parents.", "ESH: but if it makes you feel better, I was once the only kid not invited to a birthday party from the class. Years later, I became friends with the girl. So I did live and it did not cause long lasting damage. Rude for her to pass out invites at school and not invite your daughter. But you calling the mom and saying mean things is also not appropriate and not how you get a child invited after the fact.", "YTA. Dad is right. This post has me lmaooo.", "YTA. Tell your kid not to be a snitch.", "YTA\n\nListen, I get that you want your daugther to be happy and included. And I feel for your daugther, I do. \n\nBut if her behavior is already at a level where the other kids shun her, then you need to look inward and re-eexamin if you are doing enough to help her adjust her behavior. This situation is on you, not the other mother.\n\nEdit: the mature way to handle this would have been to acknowledge the problem and offer a compromise AND respecting a continued \u2018no\u2019. \n\nEx: \u201cWe realize Daugther has misunderstood our intentions when we were teaching her about alerting an adult to dangerous situation. We have been working very hard to talk to her about respecting the other kids\u2019 opinions and been a good friend and we feel like we have made some good process. Would you be willing to reconsider allowing her to come if she promises to be on her best behavior?\u201d\n(Asuming that you are working on the situation and it is moving forward of course!)", "YTA but there is a big element of E S H.\n\nYour daughter is not that well liked by the sounds of it and I can understand why she wasn't invited to the party.  But the other mother was cruel in what she did.  You either invite the entire class with no exclusions or pick 5-10 friends to invite so that not only one is excluded.\n\nYou ringing the mother will be talked about and it won't make you very popular in your small town and there will likely be more exclusion that might reach a little further than your daughter.  You're coming across as entitled mother.  I'd probably suggest ringing the mother and apologising unless she herself is known for this sort of exclusion and if that's the case, you've just given her some ammunition to use against you and paint herself as the victim.\n\nAlso mailing the invitations out wouldn't have made that much of a difference.  The kids will talk in school both before and after the party and your daughter will know about it regardless.\n\nWhen my kid was in her first year of school I kept hearing mothers talk about 'Tommy's' party that was happening in a couple of weeks time and thought it was odd that my daughter didn't get an invite as she seemed to be a good friend of 'Tommy's'.  But I didn't say anything to anyone as I just figured that she wasn't invited.  Well I found the invite in the bottom of her schoolbag in the last week of school (party hadn't happened yet) and rang the mom.  My kid actually missed the last week of school thanks to a communicable disease that requires exclusion otherwise I wouldn't have seen the invite till after the party!  And me ringing the mom was a no for the RSVP for this party thanks to illness (not RSVPing a negative is bad manners) so I wasn't going to ignore it.  But there's no way I would've considered ringing anyone to abuse them for not inviting my kid.\n\nSame where my other kid had a birthday a week apart from another kid in the class (also first year of school).  That kid invited my kid but they weren't great friends, mainly acquaintances but it was a whole class invite.  My kid had 5 kids at her party (neurodiverse kid) and the mother came and approached me and told me I was in the wrong because she invited my kid but I didn't invite hers.  So I said, fine, my kid won't come to your kids party as my kid didn't care.  I think the mom thought I would just invite her kid.  Then she gave my kid a lolly bag on the first day back at school after the party my kid didn't attend... maybe she realised she wasn't actually in the right - they were two different parties with a different level of invitees!", "YTA. You didn\u2019t like a choice another parent made and so you yelled at them. The other parent may have been wrong to call your daughter a body buzzkill (she should have at least been classier in her wording), but from your own admission that patient isn\u2019t wrong. 1st grade is a bit young for tough love type lessons, but life has a way of catching up to you even at a young age.", "Yta.  Nobody likes a snitch.  Teach your kid to mind her business.  The rule that all kids must be invited is ridiculous.  No one should be compelled to invite someone they don\u2019t like to their party.", "YTA. \u201cBasically everyone in the class is invited accept my daughter.\u201d\n\nSo your daughter wasn\u2019t singled out, and I\u2019m willing to bet zero other parents called to complain. \n\nAlso your daughter doesn\u2019t sound cautious at all, she sounds very bold with her bossiness.", "NTA love (read hate) how everyone here is getting in on the bullying of a first grader. Guess y'all sure showed that little girl why it's actually her fault she's getting bullied by grown ass adults because she can't just be a normal kid who doesn't care if other kids... Drown I guess? Great.", "So your daughter is a tattle tale and teachers pet that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t invited", "YTA\n\nEven your husband sees an issue with your daughter\u2019s behaviour and attitude. You however are not being very honest and are downplaying everything. Your kid is not well liked, deal with it.

That\u2019s a problem with you and yours, not the worlds.", "Yta. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.", "YTA. She handed the invitations out outside of the classroom for a reason, you said it was a small town so people were going to know your daughter wasn\u2019t invited anyways for people saying she broke school policy.

Part of defending your kid is giving them autonomy of association, and that includes not being forced to invite other kids they don't like.\n\nThe only thing the other parent did wrong was give out invites before class but that's pretty negligible in my book, it's not like the kids wouldn't talk about it anyway.", "I have kids around this age, if the neighbor kids don\u2019t want to play with them then I\u2019ll try to help them understand why.

I get protecting your kids, but how much fun is the birthday party going to be when OP\u2019s kid finds out no one wants her there? is that setting her kid up for success or going to help her make more friends? I seriously doubt it. OP\u2019s husband is right and OP sounds like a helicopter parent. She\u2019s six so she\u2019ll probably grow out of tattling, but OP just reinforced that she\u2019s not wrong to constantly do so.", "That would make sense.

I work in a school and it is interesting watching the dynamics of the young kids. Kids are pretty resilient and it is normal that they might be great friends one day and then on the outs the next. But you can see kids whose behavior is a turn off to the other kids (consistently saying mean things, pushing, taking toys, being excessively bossy, etc) and if the kids don't learn it can eventually be socially isolating. And there can definitely be a disconnect from what you witness in the classroom versus what parents think (we are only hearing from the mom here).  In my experience a lot of little kids tattle - it is normal for the age and they have to learn what is appropriate (teachers deal with this a lot and have their strategies). But I don't really see kids not like or exclude other kids simply for tattling, unless it is an extreme case or two kids are like oil and water and just can't get along and are always up in each other's business. \n\nI agree with points you have made and see where you are coming from. But I also see the flip side - if my kid was always antagonized or didn't get along with another kid at school and having that kid at the birthday party would very possibly cause drama, I wouldn't be impelled to invite them. But I also wouldn't pass out invites at school and/or would make sure we did something smaller so it wasn't leaving out just one kid. Luckily we never had to worry about this. My daughter when she was little either invited the whole class or all the girls. When she got older it was usually picking one friend to go do something special.", "The rules are purely in place to air gap the teachers from the drama. It's not like there wouldn't be talk about the party if invites were delivered by mail.", "Obviously in this community, everyone is not always invited (hence the mail invitations rule if not everyone is invited). Even if the other parent had mailed the invitations, OP's kid would still have found out that they were the only child not invited from class. The rule would therefore not have prevented the OP's kid from finding out they were excluded, and OP's kid would have felt hurt.\n\nAs a kid who was also usually excluded at that age, I can tell you that if OP's kid was to go, they'd likely be either completely ignored or ganged up on by the other kids. Either sucks.\n\nOP's kid was going to feel hurt no matter what.\n\nOP was not TA by calling the other parent, but definitely was TA by going off on them. It hurts to see your kid excluded. The way to deal with that hurt isn't by telling other people they're assholes because they don't want anything to do with you or your kid: it's to help figure out why your kid is excluded and work on that, or maybe try to come to a compromise (for example, other parent agrees to let OP's kid come for 30 minutes only).", "I was a child that was forced to invite someone I didn't like.

She's already admitted her child would be bossy at the other child's birthday party. At what point does that child, and the others, get a pass at having to put up with someone they consider bossy and mean and don't want to be around? This is a really tough call but when OP admitted her child would be especially bossy at that exact activity I think she tipped it in favor of exclusion. Although OP handled it really poorly and should have said the oh we wouldn't have been available anyway so you couldn't have gone because we are doing this fun activity that day.

They were not permanently even removed from the class.\n\nThey killed someone our senior year after several other close calls.\n\nThe culture that told that girl's parents in kindergarten that \"nobody likes a tattletale\" after other students potentially tried to kill her is utter bullshit.
