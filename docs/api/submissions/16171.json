The rules for the school is if you are handing out invites at school everyone in the class must be invited. If you want to exclude some people than you send the invites in the mail. My party had a birthday party in two  months ago and everyone was invited. Cindy is having a pool party in two weeks for her birthday. Her parents sent her to school with the invites and she handed them out before school started. Basically everyone in the class is invited besides my daughter.\n\nSince it was handed out before school everyone knows my daughter is not invited, my daughter is in first grade. My daughter is a rule follower and she does tattle on people to the teacher often. She is learning to mind her buisness but has trouble with it when they do something she thinks is wrong. She is also pretty cautious for a kid and will tell people to not run around a pool and what not.\n\nI called up Cindy's mom and asked if there was a mistake since my daughter came home upset. She told me no and that she is not invited due to my daughter being a bossy buzzkill. That she would ruin the party. I lost it and called her a cruel person to exclude one of her kids friends for being more catious. She hanged up on me after called me an ass.

It would have been better for your daughter not to know she was excluded, but these are young, excitable kids... she probably would have found out about this party regardless of how the invitations were distributed. If the other parents violated some school policy, then take it up with the school and let them handle it how *they* see fit. **It's not your job to enforce the rules.**\n\nYour husband knows how your daughter is. Even YOU know how your daughter is, based on your own minimizing statements. Let this be a teaching moment for your daughter: **It is also not *her* job to enforce the rules.**", "YTA. I guess they should have mailed the invites, I see why your daughter wasn't invited. Also seems that it may be a learned trait.", "YTA the parent should not have sent invites to school, however this is the consequence of being bossy and a tattle take other kids are not going to want to be friends with you. \n\nThe fact that even the day called his daughter bossy and a tattle tale tells me you are 100 percent downplaying how bad your daughter is.\n\nIt\u2019s the little girls party she can invite who she wants. By calling out the parent you just made things a 100 percent worse.", "YTA\n\nOMG I see where your daughter gets it from.", "YTA- sounds like the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Work on your kids issues before it becomes a real problem. This isn't a cautious issue, it's a superiority issue.", "ESH. She should have sent invites in the mail, so that your daughter wouldn't be hurt in all of this. Your daughter does need to learn a gentle lesson that she can't tattle on other children and expect them to like her. However, that is a lesson for you to teach, not for her to be hurt over.", "YTA\n\nThat rule is stupid. Mailing them is not going to stop kids from finding out they weren't invited or prevent hurt feelings, particularly in a small town.\n\nTime for some self-reflection, your daughter learned this behavior from you and it is doing her no favors. There is a difference between following rules and feeling like you have to be the one enforcing them. Poor little 1st grader is wound pretty tight.  Deal with that before starting fights with other parents.", "YTA\n\nCan\u2019t imagine where your daughter gets her attitude from\u2026\u2026 Maybe your daughter is this girls bully so why would she invite your daughter if that\u2019s the case?\n\nYou made a teachable moment worse by calling the other parent, You should be sitting your daughter down and teaching her how to treat people properly", "YTA\n\nWhile the other kids mom shouldn't have referred to your daughter as a bossy buzzkill, it does make sense NOT to invite her. Sad as that is to say.\n\nIts a painful way to learn a lesson.\n\nKids don't like \"tattlers\" or kids who are \"bossy\". Neither do parents.", "ESH: but if it makes you feel better, I was once the only kid not invited to a birthday party from the class. Years later, I became friends with the girl. So I did live and it did not cause long lasting damage. Rude for her to pass out invites at school and not invite your daughter. But you calling the mom and saying mean things is also not appropriate and not how you get a child invited after the fact.", "YTA. Dad is right. This post has me lmaooo.", "YTA. Tell your kid not to be a snitch.", "YTA\n\nListen, I get that you want your daugther to be happy and included. And I feel for your daugther, I do. \n\nBut if her behavior is already at a level where the other kids shun her, then you need to look inward and re-eexamin if you are doing enough to help her adjust her behavior. This situation is on you, not the other mother.", "YTA but there is a big element of E S H.\n\nYour daughter is not that well liked by the sounds of it and I can understand why she wasn't invited to the party.  But the other mother was cruel in what she did.  You either invite the entire class with no exclusions or pick 5-10 friends to invite so that not only one is excluded.\n\nYou ringing the mother will be talked about and it won't make you very popular in your small town and there will likely be more exclusion that might reach a little further than your daughter.  You're coming across as entitled mother.  I'd probably suggest ringing the mother and apologising unless she herself is known for this sort of exclusion and if that's the case, you've just given her some ammunition to use against you and paint herself as the victim.\n\nAlso mailing the invitations out wouldn't have made that much of a difference.  The kids will talk in school both before and after the party and your daughter will know about it regardless.\n\nWhen my kid was in her first year of school I kept hearing mothers talk about 'Tommy's' party that was happening in a couple of weeks time and thought it was odd that my daughter didn't get an invite as she seemed to be a good friend of 'Tommy's'.  But I didn't say anything to anyone as I just figured that she wasn't invited.  Well I found the invite in the bottom of her schoolbag in the last week of school (party hadn't happened yet) and rang the mom.  My kid actually missed the last week of school thanks to a communicable disease that requires exclusion otherwise I wouldn't have seen the invite till after the party!  And me ringing the mom was a no for the RSVP for this party thanks to illness (not RSVPing a negative is bad manners) so I wasn't going to ignore it.  But there's no way I would've considered ringing anyone to abuse them for not inviting my kid.\n\nSame where my other kid had a birthday a week apart from another kid in the class (also first year of school).  That kid invited my kid but they weren't great friends, mainly acquaintances but it was a whole class invite.  My kid had 5 kids at her party (neurodiverse kid) and the mother came and approached me and told me I was in the wrong because she invited my kid but I didn't invite hers.  So I said, fine, my kid won't come to your kids party as my kid didn't care.  I think the mom thought I would just invite her kid.  Then she gave my kid a lolly bag on the first day back at school after the party my kid didn't attend... maybe she realised she wasn't actually in the right - they were two different parties with a different level of invitees!", "YTA. You didn\u2019t like a choice another parent made and so you yelled at them. The other parent may have been wrong to call your daughter a body buzzkill (she should have at least been classier in her wording), but from your own admission that patient isn\u2019t wrong. 1st grade is a bit young for tough love type lessons, but life has a way of catching up to you even at a young age.", "Yta.  Nobody likes a snitch.  Teach your kid to mind her business.  The rule that all kids must be invited is ridiculous.  No one should be compelled to invite someone they don\u2019t like to their party.", "YTA. \u201cBasically everyone in the class is invited accept my daughter.\u201d\n\nSo your daughter wasn\u2019t singled out, and I\u2019m willing to bet zero other parents called to complain. \n\nAlso your daughter doesn\u2019t sound cautious at all, she sounds very bold with her bossiness.", "NTA love (read hate) how everyone here is getting in on the bullying of a first grader. Guess y'all sure showed that little girl why it's actually her fault she's getting bullied by grown ass adults because she can't just be a normal kid who doesn't care if other kids... Drown I guess? Great.", "So your daughter is a tattle tale and teachers pet that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t invited", "YTA\n\nEven your husband sees an issue with your daughter\u2019s behaviour and attitude. You however are not being very honest and are downplaying everything. Your kid is not well liked, deal with it. I imagine you are also not well liked. \n\nYou need to teach your kid to not be a bossy, tattletale brat and maybe she will get invited next time.", "YTA your kid sounds like a little version of yourself that nobody wants to play with. That\u2019s a problem with you and yours, not the worlds.", "Yta. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.", "YTA. She handed the invitations out outside of the classroom for a reason, you said it was a small town so people were going to know your daughter wasn\u2019t invited anyways for people saying she broke school policy. Even your husband thinks this is a lesson learned.", "YTA. Would you want someone your daughter isn\u2019t friends with coming over. \n\nGo do something extra fun that day with your daughter.", "YTA your daughter is not owed an invite. Also if her behaviour is already getting her excluded and she\u2019s only in the first grade, there\u2019s probably a problem. Work on your child\u2019s behaviour and stop having expectations that everyone will want to put up with her.", "YTA people don\u2019t like tattlers", "YTA. And those \u201ceveryone gets an invite\u201d rules are absolutely absurd. Just because kids share a classroom, does not make them friends. You should be putting more emphasis on the minding your business lesson for yourself as well.", ">My daughter is a rule follower and she does tattle on people to the teacher often. She is learning to mind her buisness but has trouble with it when they do something she thinks is wrong. She is also pretty cautious for a kid and will tell people to not run around a pool and what not.\n\nSo, you do realize this behaviour probably comes from you...right? She runs screaming to the teacher at the slightest dropped pencil and you chewed out a parent because they didn't send invites through the mail and made it obvious your daughter wasn't invited. You're a busy body, she's a mini-busy body.\n\n>My husband told me that I shouldn't have called and that Cindy's mom is correct about our kid being bossy and that this is a lesson for her to learn.\n\nHonestly, I'm glad your husband has his head on straight.

Not everyone has to be friends with your kid and quite frankly your kid sounds a tad miserable. I wouldn't have been friends with a tattletale either when I was that age. I feel bad she wasn't invited but you need to use this as a lesson for her and tell her that her bossy and tattling behavior is why she wasn't invited. She keeps this up I see many years of no birthday parties in her future.  That mom 100% should have mailed the invites so I'll give you that but give me a break.
