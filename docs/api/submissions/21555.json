My SIL used to be my best friend and I messed up and told her our would be names. When I told her my boy name she gasped said she loved it and I knew I messed up.\n\nShe got pregnant first which did hurt, however, I was excited for her. It's hard but it is possible to separate your joy for others from your grief for yourself, but from the day she found out it was very obvious I thought more of her than she did of me\n\n1) she came to our house and told my husband about her pregnancy but told him not to tell me. And being a good brother he didn't say a word. \n\n2) she said she'd announce at the family Thanksgiving dinner. She posted on Facebook on my husband and my anniversary that she was expecting and all I did for two days was cry. First because she got pregnant first and then because it clicked that I had held our relationship to a higher level than she ever did and I realized she had zero respect or affection for me\n\n3) her son is 4 years old now and she's barely spoken to me since finding out. We have never been to one of the  birthday parties for any of her children. And we've never actually met her youngest who was born last year. \n\nNow for the AITA bit:\nWhen we FINALLY got pregnant we were at an event and I was talking to one of my friends about potential baby names. I said \"we're having trouble coming up with boy names because my SIL took our top choice\" I did also say \"it really irks me because she took the name and doesn't even use it. She uses a nickname that I absolutely hate\" \n\nWell apparently one of my SILs best friends was at the event and went running, twisted my words and I apparently hate my SIL, I hate her children, she's a bad mom, she's an awful person, and so on and so on. I didn't say anything I wouldn't say to her face if she would acknowledge my existence but I can't even have a conversation with her to clear things up. She uninvited us from her wedding (they got married when they're oldest was 3), blocked us on ALL forms of social media and our numbers. When I see her at family events she gives me a nasty look and then ignores me. \n\nI used to try and say at least hello to her and her now husband and to be civil because while I may be devastated that I'll never be able to name a son what I always wanted I do not own a name and have zero say over what anyone names their child. BUT I am allowed to be upset that a name that meant a lot to my husband and I has been taken and then butchered with a god awful nickname. And yes she knows what the name meant. She just didn't care because she liked it. \n\nI am polite to her and I'm always loving to her children. They're precious and adorable and wonderful. But I refuse to use their nicknames and she refuses to speak to me.", "created_utc": 1688724376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t2wmm/aita_for_saying_my_sil_took_my_baby_name_and/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That being said, you could name your son the name you wanted. I mean, it is not literally taken. Unless you are going to use a name that will get him bullied, it is going to be shared with thousands of others. Heck, if she is avoiding you and uses a nickname for her offspring, the potential for confusion seems relatively low. \n\nI feel it is petty to potentially give your child a name you are not satisfied with just because this clown also liked the name. The name should be between you, your husband, and the kid. She shouldn't even be part of the conversation to be honest.", "ESH. I think most likely more YOU though.   Yeah, she took the name you wanted, but you said she nicknames it.  So why can\u2019t you use the name?   You also never see them, so no chance of confusion between the two.\n\nSounds like the breakdown of the relationship more on your side.  She had the colossal nerve to get pregnant first ( wonder if you even said \u2018but she\u2019s not even married).  \n\nYour bullet point number two\u2026.in what way did it \u2018click\u2019 that you \u2018held your relationship to a higher level\u2019 and she had \u2018zero respect or affection for me\u2019.   It sounds like you created some crazy drama in your head\u2026when you say things like that are you hugging your knees and rocking in a corner? \n\nI feel sorry for your husband.  You\u2019re finally pregnant but it\u2019s not good enough for you, SIL still ruining everything\u2026.not\u2026.just name the kid what you want, who cares?", "This is the part where I would die for the SIL's story. You now sound quite calm and reasonable OP, but from teeny tiny bits it seems like your frustration leaked over more than you care to remember.\n\nThe name thing is maybe frustrating , however there was no guarantee you would even have son , or her in the first place, that is why setting your mind upon a name so tightly before even conceiving is a very risky business, and a risk of your own.\n\nThe nicknaming c'mon, it is a chil, kids get nicknames from their parents, it is absolutely natural thing to do. You can't be seriously angry at that.\n\nAs for the anniverary, I am not sure if my best friends remember our anniversary (As it is only an anniversary for me and my partner duh) but I am 80% sure my SIL does not, will be 100% in the next decade or so... Why should she ? IT is anniversary for the couple to celebrate it has no bearing on other's lives.\n\nThe secrecy about the pregnancy and the sudden distancing seems like reaction to some of your ager and hurt comming through, if so she is not an AH , since it is very, very difficult to be around people who take your own life events personally and get angry about it.  Your husban agreeing to her might indicate you were indeend not in a very good place.\n\nIf none of this is true, then sure she is kind of an AH , not for the name thing , but for the distancing , however unless we get a second POV this is very relative. But soft YTA  for the unnecessary comment, you said it yourself, the name's not yours.", "I don\u2019t understand, why did she stop talking to you after she got pregnant? \n\nESH to some level, but her definitely moreso than you. \n\nIf she\u2019s blocked you on everything and won\u2019t talk to you, AND she doesn\u2019t even use the full name anyway, I\u2019d just name your son what you want to. There\u2019s no rule against cousins having the same name. If anyone asks you why that name you can just say you always planned to. \n\nIf you can\u2019t gatekeep the name then she can\u2019t either. Just go for it, I say.", "Name your child whatever you want.\n\nBut giving your boy a name that HE will be happy with through his life is the most important thing. It's the burden of the parents to judge what will be the best.", "ESH\n\nSounds like a lot of jealously and pettiness went on and is still going on between your ex-bff/SIL and you.", "After reading some of the responses from OP, it really seems like some critical info has been omitted.\n\nINFO: Why did SIL stop talking to you? Did you ever try to broach the subject and see if the breach could be healed, or did you sit back and wait for her to approach? What exactly is stopping you from using your preferred name since SIL\u2019s kid literally isn\u2019t using it? Why stir up drama for the sake of starting drama?", "YTA. If your SIL is using a nickname then the original name is still up for grabs and nobody would confuse the two. You hating the nickname is completely irrelevant to whether or not it is the name of that child. You are pinning this name thing to your jealousy that your SIL had her kid first.\n\nYou don\u2019t (and never did) own the name even if you liked it first. It\u2019s not super uncommon for cousins to share the same name anyway especially if they are named after a beloved relative or something.\n\nGet over yourself, start calling your nephew by his actual name (the one his parents give him, even if it\u2019s a nickname you dislike; it\u2019s not your place to decide what someone else\u2019s kids should be known as), and just use the full version of the name for your own child - there is NO issue here except you feeling jealous and resentful over very little.\n\nAs to the date of the announcement: maybe it was a little dig at you for being selfish. Maybe it was just because the date doesn\u2019t have the significance to your SIL that it does to you and she didn\u2019t make the connection. Either way she\u2019s right to ignore the drama you\u2019re making out of very little substance here.\n\nYou\u2019re being extremely petty, especially over a name that it sounds like you don\u2019t even have a son to use it for yet.", "ESH.\n\nYou don't own the name, and many cousins have the same name.  Refusing to acknowledge the name everyone calls your niblings is a bit petty.\n\nGIven that your relationship is now shot, the cousins won't see each other that often, so using the name you want won't cause much confusion.  It may make SIL even dislike you more, but given that she has cut you out of her life completely it probably doesn't matter.\n\nShe is the AH for causing this drama in the first place, the name was only of significance to you, it wasn't like it was a traditional name in DH's family, and for believing her friend's narrative and overreacting.", "Whilst your SIL is not blameless in this, the way you handled it from the get go was to make it as out of proportion as possible. And then, years later you decide to bring up your hurt and get blocked. \n\nYou and your SIL were friends. You\u2019ve lost that friendship, you\u2019ve lost your opportunity to be a part of that family and all because she chose the same name as you wanted for your child? \n\nYou\u2019ve brought all of this on yourself.  Playing the victim is never an attractive trait - as you are now discovering. Get over yourself and let it go. \n\nYTA", "YTA...you're whipping up a lot of unneeded drama. Nobody owns a name. You've wasted precious years with your nieces and nephews.", "Grief that she got pregnant first.\n\nSorry but that's small , petty and ridiculous in equal parts.", "ESH, but you're more YTA here. She's overreacting but so are you - sorry you had trouble conceiving but you CANNOT gatekeep names for a child that isn't even born yet and you cannot get mad if people use a nickname. It's likely your feelings are showing more than you think and SIL can do without the negativity so after the friend said something she'd had enough.\n\nShe's allowed to enjoy her pregnancies and name her kids whatever the hell she's likes and your contraception difficulties are ultimately not her problem. You suggested a \"potential\" name and she liked it, so what. It also doesn't stop you naming a future child of your own that either.", "YTA\n\nfirst, you repeatedly stated you are upset because she got pregnant first. What??? The entitlement to assume that you need to be allowed to get pregnant first and then others should get pregnant. You claimed to be happy but never once went to any of the kids parties, so you actually never were.  It\u2019s clear. You also don\u2019t get to gatekeep baby names.  Now you are making yourself the victim saying you cannot name the baby any of those names!  No one is stopping you but you to make yourself out as the victim. What you really need is therapy\n\nHer friend should have never gossiped or embellished but the fact was that you were talking shit about SIL at the event and something tells me you said a lot more than what your saying for her friend to run to her.\n\n\nYou also lie throughout your post saying you have never met the youngest kid, but then go on to make yourself the martyr and claim you have always been so nice and loving to the children because they are precious.    You also claim you are always nice to SIL,  after you also claimed that you used to trying to be nice and civil.\n\nWhich one is it because you can\u2019t keep your story consistent.", "ESH.\n\nMy mom and her cousin were given the same exact first, middle and last name, they were named after their grandmother. My mom\u2019s cousin was born just a few years before her, they never had an issue with having the same name, their dads\u2019 both had a laugh over the coincidence and the wives thought it was funny too. I say just go for it, who cares what anyone thinks. Especially if SIL already knew that was your too choice, then who the heck cares about what she thinks.\n\nETA: It wasn\u2019t confusing at all for them, because they didn\u2019t live together/see each every second, for one. My mom used their middle name as her \u201cnickname\u201d because she preferred it, her cousin used their first name. Both went by their middle name as adults, they were living their own lives at that point too. \n\nIf your SIL\u2019s kid is going by a nickname then use the whole name for your kid and refer to him as the actual name, no nickname. There will be no confusion for the kids because they will be use to whatever name they\u2019re called on the daily.", "So my cousins Mom did the same thing. We were born 4 weeks apart. We have the same first, middle and last name. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly not to confusing, we also live 20mins away from eachother too. Our biggest flex is we share rewards cards for stores so we get 2x the points at certain stores \ud83d\udc80", "Good grief you\u2019re exhausting. Your post comes across bitter and jealous. If it reads this way to complete strangers, no wonder SIL went NC. If you two were as close as you say you are, I highly doubt that she just decided to reduce contact with you once she got pregnant. Something happened, and you appear to be in denial about that. Complaining about her at an event was just simply the icing on the cake. You\u2019re still upset about what she named her kid, at what point are you going to let it go?", "YTA and are here trying to defend it in the comments, that have definitely not gone as you planned. You sound bitter and childish. Name your child whatever you want. Take some accountability for the part you play in this drama and before you bother your SIL get some therapy to work through your big feelings about all this. Stop using the \"TTC Community\" bit to gain sympathy and grow up some before your baby gets here. Congratulations on your pregnancy, you really don't need the added stress of this childish drama you are creating for yourself. Instead of arguing with reddit, take a good hard look in the mirror and think about what this pettiness has cost you already.", "YTA. Just use the name. No one owns it. But also? Grow up. I get that you felt pain over struggling to get pregnant and that it was shitty for her to use the name you chose, but there is a difference between being sad and being bitter and angry. You chose to ostracize yourself from them and then griped about the name at an event? You made this what it is. Also? Refusing to use the children\u2019s nicknames is petty and confusing and unkind to those babies, who are innocent in all of this.", "This is a clear cut case of Everyone Sucks Here as I've ever seen.\n\nYou suck, your SIL sucks, all fair I guess", "NTA.  Name your child the name you've always wanted.  There is nothing wrong with two kids having the same name.", "I don\u2019t get the YTAs. SIL was OPs best friend and seems to have shown little sensitivity. I think how OP put her feeling across (if it really happened that way) was quite reasonable. It\u2019s ok to show and express disappointment as long as it\u2019s not hammered across because as OP says, she cannot gatekeeper a name. \n\nHowever, I am thinking there\u2019s probably more to the story and quite possibly that your tone was not as reasonable as OP seemed to think it was. I think the only person OP can get resolution from is SIL. I\u2019m sure if she sat down with her she\u2019d probably receive an equal list of grievances.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide whether or not someone else goes by a nickname, and it is disrespectful not to use someone\u2019s preferred nickname. And just because they use a nickname you don\u2019t like doesn\u2019t mean anything has been butchered.  \nAnd finally you can use the name yourself. The other child goes by a nickname so it won\u2019t be confusing and since you are so against the nickname in question you won\u2019t be using it.", "YTA", "Name ownership is Not A Thing. If that's why you're butthurt, you are TA.", "NTA.   Just go ahead and give your son the name you originally planned.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot gatekeep names from people because you said them or thought of them first.\n\nI have a similar name to a cousin of mine and we joke about it when we see each other.\n\nI'm honestly not certain if your SIL is also TA but you certainly are. You sound bitter about something you shouldn't be entitled to. The comment you made doesn't exactly show any affection for your SIL it just says she stole my idea.\n\n>I am polite to her and I'm always loving to her children. \n\nClaiming to be polite to someone means you don't smear them behind their back.", "YTA", "Despite the fact that the law in your area clearly states that absolute rights over baby names go to the one who first thought up a name and no one else can ever ever have that name, YTA.", "YTA. You don\u2019t own a baby name and it\u2019s obvious you harbor some resentment toward SIL because she dared to happy when you clearly aren\u2019t.
