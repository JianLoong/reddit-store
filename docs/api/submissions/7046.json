Over the past couple of years I\u2019ve managed to become completely debt-free, started a savings account, and boosted my credit score considerably. I considered my purchase to be a reward for myself for being financially responsible, as well as a replacement for my older, less-than-reliable vehicle. I purposely chose not to tell my father (who lives in another state) about my purchase because he is the most hypercritical being on the planet. I love him, but he can turn any subject into a 30 minute lecture on what I could\u2019ve done better.\n\nGiven Dad\u2019s nature, I asked each member of my family that regularly speaks to him to not mention the vehicle. I accepted that he would find out eventually, but I was not in a hurry for that day to arrive. I asked my brother (21M) in particular not to say anything, because he knows just as well as I do how dad would react. \n\nNot even a day later I received a phone call from my dad. He asked me how I could be so irresponsible, and \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d get rid of my old car for no good reason\u201d. He proceeded to criticize everything about my purchase, from the make/model to the trim level and even the color (he thinks black was a \u201cpoor choice\u201d because it\u2019s harder to keep clean). After a thorough tongue-lashing, I point-blank asked him how he found out. He simply said \u201cyour brother texted me a picture of it\u201d. This next part is where I might be the asshole. \n\nI asked my dad, \u201cHey do you remember how you said *brother\u2019s name* isn\u2019t allowed to have pets in his house since he\u2019s renting it from you? We\u2019ll he\u2019s adopted several cats and dogs since you moved out of state\u201d. My dad promptly ended the conversation and within an hour I had text messages from my mom, sister, and my brother all asking \u201cwhy the fuck I told Dad that\u201d, since he was now giving my brother the ultimatum of either finding new homes for all of his animals, or being evicted from his house. \n\nTL;DR: My brother told my dad about my new car, so I told my dad about him having animals in the home he\u2019s renting from my father causing him to have to get rid of the animals or be evicted.
