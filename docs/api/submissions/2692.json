I was forced to quit all my extracurriculars. I was never allowed to go anywhere or do anything outside of school hours because they would need someone to complete chores while they were at the hospital with Daniella or look after Daniella while they went out to \u201chave fun.\u201d It was very common for them to say things like \u201cYou get to see your friends every day at school. We only get to see ours two nights a week!\u201d They would be out until midnight most times and I would be on my own taking care of Daniella. I moved out the day I graduated high school. I only talk to my parents for family emergencies, because any other conversation becomes about me again becoming a full-time, unpaid caregiver for Daniella.\n\nRecently my father experienced a health scare. He is fine, but it made my parents realize that they are getting older and will not be able to take care of Daniella someday. They finally got Daniella on a waiting list for a care home, but it\u2019s obviously a very long wait and it\u2019s very likely that my parents will either pass away or become unable to care for Daniella before it will be her turn to enter the care home. My parents explained this to me and said how since I have the ability to work from home with my job, I can start \u201ctaking over\u201d certain days with Daniella\u2019s care to \u201cget back into the hang of\u201d it and be ready in case I need to become her full-time caregiver.\n\nI explained that I would not work from home, because it makes less money and I want to focus on advancing my career. I also wanted free time for my own hobbies and outside social life.

Yes it would be cool if you could spend time with her and help out every once in a while. \n \nBut it doesn\u2019t sound like you can do that. It sounds like if you give your parents an inch they\u2019ll take a mile. So this isn\u2019t actually about Daniella this is about your parents, and that\u2019s what you should tell anyone who tries to get onto you about it. \n \nYour parents are the parents here. She\u2019s their child. It\u2019s their responsibility to ensure she has proper care, not yours (it would be nice if you could contribute to that but it\u2019s not a requirement). \n \nYou deserve to have your own life, your own career and hobbies. Just as much as Daniella deserves to be as independent as possible and be cared for. You are not less than your sister, your career and dreams and happiness aren\u2019t less than her happiness. \n \nDo I think that maybe sometime down the road you should consider making time to see her for a little while each week? Yes, I do. \n \nDoes that mean you should take over her care for days? Or full time for the rest of your life? No.", "It\u2019s brilliant that she has so many extended family members that feel so strongly about it because they can take over her care since they feel SO PASSIONATE about it.

She is not your responsibility. Tell our other family members and acquaintances you already put in your time taking care of her and now it's their turn. NTA", "Seems like you missed enough of your life so your parents could have one when you were younger. They should have sought external help much sooner. NTA.", "Hard NTA.

Don't let them steal your life .\n\nSo your borther is on NC with them ?", "Oh buddy this was a little intense to read. NTA... I get that it is your sister but thats the key word here Sister. You are not obligated to be her fulltime caregiver. I can understand helping out a bit to give them a break but she needs proper care from professionals. You still need to be able to live the life you were given and do whats best for your life. \n\nI am so sorry that you are going through this.", "NTA - NTA at all!!! Stay strong with your boundary. This is not on you. Your parents are manipulative and are doing a great job guilting you. Time to put yourself first.", "NTA you are not obligated to be a care giver for your sister. You should be able to have your own life. Not only did you already sacrifice your own childhood and teen years but now your parents expect you to do it for the rest of your life. Of course you care for your sister but you don\u2019t want to be responsible or free labor for your parents. If those family members complain so much why don\u2019t they offer to take care of her. Is it safe to assume your brother has a family now so that\u2019s why your parents are asked you? I don\u2019t think you are being ableist you do love your sister but it\u2019s good to set boundaries. You have your own life to live but I also hope that Daniella will be cared for by someone willing. That way everyone is happy.", "NTA at all.

Your parents already made decisions about you and your siblings when they brought you into existence. It's time for you to decide what's best for you now.\n\nIt's great you are focusing on your career because there will be no financial assistance forthcoming from your parents in future, with all their assets going towards Daniella's residential care when your parents can't look after her any longer.", "NTA. AT ALL. All these family members who want you to sign your life away are welcome to volunteer. Or stuff it. As to the acquaintances, you might let them know you already gave up a good chunk of childhood. They are welcome to sign up of course. \n\nOr stuff it. \n\nFrankly I would go NC with the whole lot of them at this point. \n\nYou are not being ableist. Or selfish for that matter. Your parents have been dropping the ball for decades now. They apparently forgot they had three kids. They were more than willing to take care of your sister, but what about you and your brother? There should have been part time caregivers or respite care to take care of her while your parents got breaks and maybe even parented you. Some of those family members criticizing you now should have maybe been there to help out. So your parents could spend time with their other children and with each other. \n\nI get having a disabled child is very tough. I have seen what it does to families. But you can't allow the disabilities one child suffers to also steal a semblance of normal life for other children or their parents. You and your brother had your childhoods crippled in a way as well. \n\nIt is not your job and never was. Sure, you could willingly volunteer. Some people do. But it should not be an expectation.

Accommodations don\u2019t require one specific person to give up their life and be a fulltime caretaker.\n\nYou are not making a statement about disabled people *by wanting to live your own life*.\n\nI bet none of those other family members are volunteering to be fulltime caretakers. And here\u2019s the other observation - they aren\u2019t asking you to step in when/if they can\u2019t care for Danielle.\n\nThey expect you to give up your life *now*. They want to sabotage your career *now*.", "You are NTA. I was in a similar situation after my parents divorced. Be strong. When people berate you over this, tell them you\u2019re happy they are offering to take care of Daniella.", "Every single person coming after you for not wanting to take care of your sister tell them you are giving their info to your parents that they volunteered to take care of your sister. And tell them if they don\u2019t they\u2019re ableists. They\u2019ll stop bothering you.", "NTA, wanna bet they didn't actually put her on a waiting list and are counting on breaking you down? You are not her parent, and yours have stolen enough of your life from you. Your brother isn't part if his conversation I'm guessing because he cut them off already and it's probably time you do the same", "NTA\nYou are 100% right with this one.\nDaniella is not your responsibility and never should have been.\nYour parents have had many years to organise care for her, and haven't.\n\nHave you (and your older brother) told your parents outright that what they did to you as children was appalling. Should never have happened and both you and your brother moved out of home because you were treated that way?? Just pure honesty. Seems your parents are in complete denial.\n\nSiblings should never be held responsible for their disabled siblings. For day to day care. In our family, a sibling has taken over the management decision's, but the disabled to person is in a care facility.", "NTA\n\nFunny how your parents didn\u2019t follow their own statement about hobbies and other things when they left you to care for your sister and went out. \n\nYou are not obligated to put your life on hold.\nThey should have thought about long term care sooner than this. The entire situation sucks but you can\u2019t destroy someone else\u2019s life to make them a caregiver. It\u2019s not right.", "NTA Your parents should have put her on the waiting list years ago. This wasnot a surprise, they could have transitioned her into a care home years ago, continued to visit her, and even had more free time for themselves. They planned badly.", "NTA. When your parents found out that your sister would need someone caring for her all the time they should have started making arrangements for the day that they were no longer physically able to care for her that didn't include you or your brother. Your sister is there child and that make her there responsibility not yours. You gave up your childhood so they could party no way in hell should you give up your career and life.

When she was 12 she came to me saying that when she was an adult she wanted her brother to live with her, and that she wanted to take care of him like me and my husband did. She maintained that position until he passed away. It may sound strange, but because we NEVER expected or required her to care for him, she really wanted to.

She would, without anyone asking do random things for him, like play his favorite music, push him in his wheelchair, move him to the room with her while she was playing. \n\nMy husband and I never had a date night or night away, just us.
