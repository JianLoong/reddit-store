Me and my Husband (her brother) already have a 2 year old and her twin sister already got a few kids, so she was the last of us childless. \n\nHere comes the \"twist\", we lost our second born in July on their birth, in an absolute unpredictable way.\nWe personally don't wait until a certain week to announce a pregnancy because life is unpredictable and you have no guarantees anyway. \nSo we announced this pregnancy way before week 12 and her exact words were \"you're pretty brave to announce the pregnancy that early\".\nThe birth of said child was also the reason we weren't able to attend her wedding which just happened on the same day a 4 hour drive away (we didn't spread the news about our sons death on that day though). \n\nShe announced her pregnancy at a little get together that originally took place to celebrate her and her twin sisters birthday. Apparently she wasn't pregnant with one children but twins but lost the child early into pregnancy. And she was openly happy about it. She started listing all the reasons she was glad that she didn't have to buy everything twice and didn't have to do twice the work ect..\n\nI was sitting across the table and I didn't even know how to react, first of all of course her pregnancy announcement triggered some feelings of jealousy and I would have wished for her to tell us beforehand and not in a room full of people. But I'm not mad about that or anything although I find it a bit insensitive.\nOn the other hand her happiness about loosing a child left me speechless, I mean I guess I kinda get her train of thoughts but I think some thoughts are inside thoughts and I must admit I felt offended about being confronted with her reaction to child loss in that kinda way. \n\nAnyway neither me not my husband got up to hug her or congratulate her and she later on texted my husband that she wasn't happy about the way we acted.", "created_utc": 1697741339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bqfmo/aita_for_not_congratulating_my_sil_on_her/", "score": 1895, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you can explain your reaction (calmly); after suffering a loss herself, I'm sure she'll be able to understand, at least a little. And while it sounds like she's in the denial phase of grief, I hope you'll be able to be there for her as she deals with her own loss, too.", "NAH it\u2019s all a very difficult. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and of course you\u2019re still grieving and comments hurt and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re allowed to feel that way and also a little jealous. \n\nYour SIL is also allowed to feel the way she does and honestly sounds like she may be putting on a brave face and making joking comments (as many of us do) as a way of dealing with her own grief. \n\nMaybe instead of growing apart, and being bitter reach out and be each others support for you both have lost and are grieving.\n\nEdit: typo", "Your SIL is probably trying to rationalise her grief. I don't see any AHs here.", "I don\u2019t think anyone here is an asshole. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss", "NAH.\n\nYou're allowed to be uncomfortable and upset and process that in your own way. \n\nShe's allowed to be excited and announce her pregnancy in her way. \n\nNot everyone considers a fetus to be a person (I don't) so losing one, especially very early on, and still being pregnant may legitimately be a relief to her (it would be to me, 2 babies at one time is no joke). You don't have to agree or approve, but the fact that you don't agree doesn't make her wrong. \n\nI think for most women, losing an early pregnancy is *very different* from losing a child during birth, and it's unrealistic to compare the 2 as equal tragedies. BUT, given how recently you lost your child, I can fully understand why her relief would seem offensive to you.", "NAH. I get why her comments would have been jarring to you, but you have to remember that everyone deals with loss differently.", "NAH but you are kind of in the wrong.\n\nShe lost a baby too.  And she\u2019s dealing with as best she can.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe you anything and she doesn\u2019t have to tell you separately.  It\u2019s her news to share as she sees fit.  You didn\u2019t have to hug her but a simple \u201cyay\u201d \u201cor Im happy for you\u201d would have be sufficient", "NAH\n\nYou have every right to have been stunned by the announcement. She has every right to be stunned by your lack of reaction. You all seem to be ignoring the feelings of the other due to the individual things you each are going through.\n\nDid your husband explain why the two of you reacted the way you did? I'm guessing if he does that your SIL is going to be horribly sad that she hurt you, and I'd be willing to bet that this (or just time) will leave you sad that you didn't respond to her announcement better.\n\nI get that you're hurting, but she likely is too. She dealt with her pain in a way that helped (or she thought was helping) her to get over it. You dealt with your pain differently. You don't understand her action and she doesn't understand your lack of reaction.", "I'm so sorry for your loss \ud83d\ude14", "Let her be unhappy. She was processing her feelings her way. You were processing your feelings your way. Given the background, you and your husband can be given a pass for not responding with immediate joy. That moment is passed; now you can move forward with more positive feelings toward the birth of this newest child to the family.", "Dealing with family is hard. Dealing with family that is dealing with trauma is even harder. You all are processing grief and expressing it in different ways. For you it might be jealousy and depression. For her, it might be putting on a happy face and trying to ignore it. You don\u2019t know what she\u2019s feeling behind closed doors. You all need to give each other some grace. I would just explain you and your husband are still dealing with grief and need some space and to not take it personally. Then wish her the best and say you\u2019re happy for her.", "NAH here. You had a valid, emotional response since you were still recovering from your loss. She is likely putting on a brave face and trying to be happy for the surviving twin.\n\nI would still write out call and apologize, just saying that the lost twin triggered your grief so you weren't at your best. Congratulate her for her future offspring coming, and try to move on.", "I just wanted to share my perspective on the feelings that your sister in law may have. I was her. I had a vanishing twin too. While I was truly relieved that I wasn\u2019t going to have 2 babies (this was already my fourth pregnancy, I already had 3 children) , I can tell you a part of my heart hurt and still does, even though I have already given birth. Everytime I see twins I do think of what ifs and being a twin herself, your SIL likely feels the pain more. Having a vanishing twin is a strange kind of grief. It\u2019s having a miscarriage that\u2019s unseen and yet you\u2019re still expected to be happy that you have the surviving twin. She\u2019s not bragging, it\u2019s her way of coping with loss.", "Nah. I have a feeling she wasn\u2019t \u201chappy\u201d, but maybe relieved regarding the financial burden and workload that having twins can bring. People have a hard time describing their feelings correctly, and it sounds like she communicated her emotions hastily. \n\nIt also sounds like your loss has impacted you in a way that is interfering with your ability to remain objective towards other people\u2019s experiences. I suggest two things- first, seek help to properly process your loss. Second, send a text over to your SIL and explain that you ARE happy for her. Your reaction was a response to some feelings about your own loss that you weren\u2019t expecting, and you should apologize for displacing those feelings on to her. \n\nShe isn\u2019t responsible for managing your response to your personal triggers, even if you didn\u2019t know you had them. It\u2019s on you to ensure you can compartmentalize your feelings in the moment, then process them in private. Now that you\u2019re aware of the trigger, work to make it easier to deal with going forward. \n\nAlso, how would she have known to give you a heads up about this when you weren\u2019t even aware that you would feel this way? I understand that she is aware of your loss, but how is she supposed to know that talking about her feelings of relief about her own loss would upset you so much? It\u2019s on you to manage your responses to triggering situations like this. Could she have checked in with you beforehand to let you know? Sure. But again, how could she have been more sensitive towards you when she didn\u2019t even know she needed to be?", "I mean, I get where you're emotions were coming from. If it were me, I might have still at least said congrats.\n\nBut I think it's also entirely possible that she's trying to cope. I could be wrong. But I think too many people are too quick to jump to the worst case scenario and assume the worst. It's entirely possible she's choosing to try to put this positive spin on it to cope with disappointment. It's entirely possible she feels confused on how to feel because she lost a baby, but she's still pregnant, and for now, still going to have a baby. She lost a fetus she didn't really know for long. And she might have not wanted to bring down the mood with being depressed.\n\nI might get downvoted but my vote here is NAH. I think you both are dealing with some emotionally triggering things and that are hard to navigate. And she was perhaps a bit insensitive in handling. And you were a bit petty in keeping to yourself. But I don't think either of you was intentionally being awful.", "NAH. She's rationalizing her grief at losing an unborn child. It has nothing to do with you or your own loss.\n\nShe can be \"unhappy\" about your lack of congratulations, but your DH can and should explain that the two of you are still grieving, and were a little taken about by the way she was \"finding the positives\" in losing a child. You were shocked and overwhelmed but meant her no personal disrespect.", "NTA I was very pregnant when someone lost a baby and I knew to stay away from her because she was grieving. I asked her husband if I could send anything over to their house but my baby belly was not something she needed to see when she was hurting. So sorry for your loss!", "It's difficult to say what's happening but some people do use 'gallows humor' as a coping mechanism to hid their anguish.", "NAH both yours and hers feelings are valid", "I am absolutely BAFFLED by the Y T A. You lost a child you carried full term 3 months ago. First of all, I am so so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou handled it like a pro. Way better then I could ever do. At 3 months post partum I am still an emotional wreck. You have to also deal with the greatest loss someone has to deal with.\n\nYour SIL showed zero empathy for you and your loss. That you managed to stay quiet and not be overwhelmed with grief is so strong of you. I would not have been able to \n\nSIL has every right to be happy and deal with her own loss in her own way. But it would have suited her to do without you being present and let you have time to come to terms with all this news.\n\nI am so so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA, but congratulate her. Every child is worth celebrating.\n\nWhen I lost my child in the second trimester, between my tears, I mumbled, \"I didn't want a newborn in February either way\" - it helped me cope with losing my child. She is doing the same.", "Very soft YTA", "YTA \n\nWhen there is nothing to be done about a thing that happen people react in a different way. Some people try to concentrate on the positive aspects with al their minds so that they're not sad or depressed even. You don't know if that wasn't the case here, you judge solely based on your personal feelings and get offended when someone is not complying with them?\n\nSecondly, not everyone is up for having twins. It is quite a hassle, so for some, it is indeed positive to have only one baby per pregnancy. Around 20% of cases where there are two fetuses originally end up with one being absorbed in the initial weeks of the pregnancy ( and those are the ones that manage to get scanned, there are probably more cases since when absorbed the scan doesn't really show), it is so common, that she maybe did not see it as such a big deal. It is a very very different situation from a stillborn full-term baby. \n\nAnd why the hell should she inform you about her informing people about her pregnancy? I am really sorry about your loss, but it is your loss, can't determine other people's lives. \n\nAll in all, this was not a personal attack on you in any way, and nobody meant you any harm and you still judge her, based off you subjective experience only, even now after cooling off, hence why my score .", "NTA.  Maybe she truly isn't happy about losing one of the babies but this is jut her way of coping right now ... ??", "YTA, you don't get to decide how she processes the loss of a pregnancy. If she wants to focus on the positives and the pregnancy that is still going and remind herself of the negatives that could have come with with twins, that is how she is processing and she is allowed to do so. Judging her based on your personal experience is not fair and it's clear she wanted to be happy about the experience she is having so far instead of dwelling on the grief, you could have taken a more supportive and understanding route.", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t have been an AH either if she hadn\u2019t called you and your husband to admonish the two of you for not reacting with joy. She is allowed to feel her feelings, but her trying to force you into faking happiness for her is an AH move.", "ESH a bit. She doesn\u2019t sound considerate of your loss and I\u2019d hold a grudge for that comment. \n\nStill, it\u2019s not really your place to put a shadow on her announcement or judge her reaction. It\u2019s her pregnancy, she\u2019s a hormonal train wreck, and if she wants to put on a happy face then let her.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re also a train wreck; I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I'm sorry honey for your loss. Big hugs.", "NAH. I get it though - as someone who has had both comparing an early loss to a stillbirth as \u201cthe same thing\u201d like some of the other comments are is triggering. There is a difference between delivering a dead baby when you went through pregnancy with everything being ok and having a heavy bleed when you\u2019ve only gotten a positive test a few weeks ago or a vanishing twin. It would have been more sensitive of her to give you a heads up ahead of time in private. But when someone hasn\u2019t gone through it, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily understand that.", "NTA while I don\u2019t think she needed to warn you before announcing or anything like that, to talk cheerfully about losing one is extremely insensitive especially knowing what happened to you. It\u2019s perfectly understandable that you didn\u2019t get up and congratulate her after being blindsided like that. Also, her comment about being brave to announce it early was pretty damn insensitive too.", "She may not even see what she went through as being like what you went through. She lost an embryo at a few weeks and still has one. \n\nYou lost your baby. \n\nThis is how she may see things\u2014even you (and I for the record) may see things differently. \n\nBut considering this as a possible POV could explain her callousness\u2014she didn\u2019t see the connection to your immense suffering in what happened to her.", "YTA Your SIL is excited about her pregnancy, and instead of being supportive, you sit there with a chip on your shoulder. She lost a child too, and it's her way of coping. Maybe you should learn a thing or two about empathy and not make everything about your own struggles. The world doesn't revolve around your grief, and it's not an excuse to be a jerk to others.", "It is a tough call - maybe she is saying she is happy she lost one of the babies because the alternative is too difficult for her. Maybe she is trying to focus on the joy of not losing both babies?\nEither way, she suffered a miscarriage and is pregnant with her first child.\nTelling her congratulations and wishing her a continued healthy pregnancy should have been the minimum you did.", "I just want to say I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my second son 2 years ago on the 15th of November. My friend had a baby on his due date and I couldn't even look at that baby. I would hide if they were in the same place as me. We all react differently when losing a child. It's the worst thing in the world. This month is pregnancy and infant loss awareness month and will be thinking of your baby too.", "Having lost a child to full term stillbirth and one to miscarriage you are not the ass. She is 100% the ass. And she can kick bricks.", "NTA. I'm speechless. Who says things like that. I pray it's a trauma response, but I know women who would be just as gross. Please accept my deepest condolences. My identical twins son passed at 15 months. The crap people said to her after was appalling. I'm so sorry for your loss and to have to deal with that.", "NAH it is completely ok for you to be sensitive and still mourning and it is also fine for her to be ok with a miscarriage/loss of a twin pregnancy. It's easy to get stuck in the mindset of \"they should be grateful to be having more kids\" when we experience a loss ourselves, but it's important to remember that other people are allowed to view pregnancy loss differently. If someone you knew didn't want a pregnancy and took a plan B, had a miscarriage (and was glad) or planned an abortion, it wouldn't be to be insensitive towards you personally. You should try to view your SILs news in a similar light.", "It's nice to see everyone thinks it's her way of coping, but what if she really doesn't care and is actually very happy about it .

I think a private heads up so you and your partner could be prepared would have been better. Just so you can process it in private. Of course it\u2019s going to raise emotions and memories. \n\nI understand why you find her talking about the death of the twin triggering (another reason a heads up would\u2019ve been good) but you can\u2019t judge her for her reaction to this. It\u2019s personal. And maybe she\u2019s not reacting the same as you, maybe it\u2019s all a mask for her own grief. Either way you can\u2019t make judgement on that. \n\nBe kind to yourself. Losing a child is a very deep grief.", "NTA. Honestly she wouldn\u2019t have even been an asshole until she called to tell you she was made about you guys not congratulating her. \n\nShe knows that you lost a baby 3 months ago, it would have been a kindness to share the news in private ahead of time. And regardless of her feelings it\u2019s fairly insensitive to make comments about being happy she lost one of the fetuses while in the room with someone who lost their baby so recently. To then call about your lack of congratulations puts her fairly into asshole territory.", "NTA you are very valid in your response. Your sister really should have told you via txt before she did the big announcement so that you could have had time to process it in your own way and time. There\u2019s just not enough \u201ceducation\u201d on this topic so people don\u2019t think about it enough", "NTA - I'm sorry for your loss. I'm also sorry all these comments are comparing the death of your baby to her early loss and saying they are the same. People don't get it so I hope you take those comments with a pinch of salt and listen to the people that do. While I agree loss is loss and miscarriages are very traumatic and painful, it just really isn't the same. I've experienced 6 miscarriages and a full-term stillbirth. \n\nYour SILs feelings are valid - maybe this is her way of dealing with the pain of the loss or maybe she did genuinely feel relief at having a singleton. After all, twin pregnancies often come with lots of risks and extra expense. But she was completely tactless and you are not her target audience for these kind of comments. Especially while it's all still so raw. I think it would've been a different story too if she had later reflected on her comments and realised she'd put her foot in it but to be annoyed at you suggests she's not a very empathetic person to me.", "NTA You know, I'm having to deal with the same kind of issue. People withhold information from you, give it to you way past the time you should have had it/in a not optimal situation, and then when you don't react in the way they think you should, suddenly you're the bad guy. It just doesn't work that way. If she doesn't realize that hearing about a pregnancy AND the loss of one of their twins so close to your own loss is going to take some getting used to and she probably doesn't want to hear your first reactions.\n\nSorry for your loss. Hopefully someone gives her a reality check at some point.", "ESH, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re sensitive, but I would bet that her comments are a way of coping with her own loss. People handle grief in every way, and none are wrong. Just as people dealing with infertility will tell people that they don\u2019t want kids, or are glad they get to sleep at night to deflect from their true feelings. However, if she truly didn\u2019t want twins, that\u2019s also a valid feeling. People selectively reduce pregnancy all the time because of the added risks and concerns that come with a multiple pregnancy. Your feelings of sadness for yourself are valid, but when you let them affect your relationship with others, that\u2019s an issue.", "NTA\n\nShe bragged about losing a child after you lost yours. She's a giant asshole.", "NTA. \n\nMy baby died during labour too, in our case it was medical negligence. If someone behaved that way around me, I would be done. Absolutely done. All the people who care about me are careful about baby talk and baby announcements - they definitely tell me separately (or my mum does it for them) and they don't expect my participation. They know I love them and wish them well, but they love me and wish me well too, and they know how excruciating anything baby related is for me. They know how fragile I am. \n\nAnd I'm sort of on the other side now too, because I am pregnant and will soon be announcing to parents I have met since my daughter died, whose babies died too. There is no way in hell I'll be doing it the way your SIL did. No way. Honestly, I'll be texting to let them know and then never mentioning it again. Texting so they have time and space to react however they react, which will likely be tears and flashbacks. Not mentioning again because I know how hard it is. I'm not putting them through that - I have other people who can and will be happy for me and supportive. I am relying on them, not on people who are broken by grief and trauma. \n\nYour SIL has her own stuff going on. She has every right to feel how she feels, and cope how she copes. She has no right to expect you to be just fine with hearing that then to be all nice to her. She should do whatever she wants to do, just away from you.", "YTA. You\u2019re grieving and that\u2019s valid but the world doesn\u2019t stop for your grief. Your SIL watched and (assumably) congratulated you and her sister for all your pregnancies for years and finally gets to announce her own. She\u2019s allowed to be excited, and in her excitement its very understandable she wasn\u2019t thinking of you first. Because *not everything is about you*. You easily could have congratulated her.", "NTA and I am so sorry for your loss\nbut\u2026 your SIL had every right to announce her pregnancy the way she wanted to. Her pleasure at losing one child might be a mask. She knows what it is to be a twin and if they had a good relationship she knows what her child will be missing. Maybe she is talking herself into that it was actually a good thing. \nYour SIL is also incredibly insensitive with what she said about your announcement of your child. \nYour choosing to hug her was your own call. And again she is incredibly insensitive for then calling you two out on it. Then again she is caught up in OMG I am going to have a baby!!!\nI had something similar happen in my family. My sister got pregnant after me both times. Our sons were born just a few weeks apart. When I got pregnant the second time so did she a few weeks later but she lost that pregnancy at about 10 weeks, they could never find a heartbeat. A week or so later I mentioned that I got my due date and my sister never spoke to me again until after I had my baby. The only reason she did was because she found out she was pregnant again. She punished me and told my family that I was mean and selfish. All because I was able to carry my pregnancy. \nPlease understand that while you suffered a devastating loss it didn\u2019t stop everyone else plans for the future including yours. There will be many more times you are in a similar situation and it\u2019s not fair but unfortunately nothing in life is fair. \nI think I might sit her down and have a conversation letting her know that you will never forget what she said to you and how things turned out. She needs to know for future reference not to do this again.", "YTA. Ppl deal with their grief differently, I highly doubt shes genuenly happy about the death of her kid, but shes coping by trying to look for a positive. You dont need to agree wih her reasoning, but you dont also need to judge her for it. You're also not entitled to know about her pregnancy just bc you suffered a miscarriage, im sorry fo your loss, but its been 4 months, how much longer are ppl supposed to tiptoe around you and be obligated to not tell their own news? \n\nOverall, you and your husband acted childish", "YTA\n\nShe lost a child and she is probably making up reasons why it is supposedly a good thing, because she is hurting and doesn't want anyone to know. Her being anxious about announcing a pregnancy earlier than week 12 might be due to more losses in the past. You just wouldn't know about them, because she never talked about it with you.\n\nShe also doesn't owe you a heads-up, as tragic as your loss is, but I do understand why you would've appreciated that. I wish you all the best for your healing process.", "NTA. Your SIL was extremely insensitive to your situation. I winced when I read about her comment that  \"you're pretty brave\" and not letting you and your husband know about her pregnancy before the group announcement. It sounds like she lacks empathy and common sense. It probably isn't directed at you personally. \n\nPublicly acting happy about losing one of her twins initially made me her dislike her even though I don't know her! Yes, twin pregnancies carry higher risks. I have twins. But it's such cringey behavior that maybe she's just \"wired differently\" from most of us, and she can't be any other way?\n\nAs soon as you have gotten past the hurt of the recent dust-up at the birthday party, don't you think you could offer your congratulations? If you think the situation lends itself to it, you could mention that you were feeling particularly sensitive at that time. No good reason to mention her comment on your announcement or wishing she'd given you a heads up about hers. Being the object of your in-laws' \"disappointment\" won't make you feel any better.\n\nEdited for grammar", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Me and my Husband (her brother) already have a 2 year old and her twin sister already got a few kids, so she was the last of us childless. \n\nHere comes the \"twist\", we lost our second born in July on their birth, in an absolute unpredictable way.\nWe personally don't wait until a certain week to announce a pregnancy because life is unpredictable and you have no guarantees anyway. \nSo we announced this pregnancy way before week 12 and her exact words were \"you're pretty brave to announce the pregnancy that early\".\nThe birth of said child was also the reason we weren't able to attend her wedding which just happened on the same day a 4 hour drive away (we didn't spread the news about our sons death on that day though). \n\nShe announced her pregnancy at a little get together that originally took place to celebrate her and her twin sisters birthday. Apparently she wasn't pregnant with one children but twins but lost the child early into pregnancy. And she was openly happy about it. She started listing all the reasons she was glad that she didn't have to buy everything twice and didn't have to do twice the work ect..\n\nI was sitting across the table and I didn't even know how to react, first of all of course her pregnancy announcement triggered some feelings of jealousy and I would have wished for her to tell us beforehand and not in a room full of people. But I'm not mad about that or anything although I find it a bit insensitive.\nOn the other hand her happiness about loosing a child left me speechless, I mean I guess I kinda get her train of thoughts but I think some thoughts are inside thoughts and I must admit I felt offended about being confronted with her reaction to child loss in that kinda way. \n\nAnyway neither me not my husband got up to hug her or congratulate her and she later on texted my husband that she wasn't happy about the way we acted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Even giving her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't so much happy about only having one baby but still in shock and trying to convince herself she's fine, her saying that shit in front of you was way out of line.", ">***\"...she later on texted my husband that she wasn't happy...\"***\n\nSo what? Let her be unhappy.  Not everyone is happy all the time.  Life has a full range of emotions and moods that she is free to explore.\n\nNTA.", "ESH. It seems two have some animosity going way back. You called her childless, she judged you when you announced an early pregnancy, etc. You don\u2019t like her and she doesn\u2019t like you. So you both are assholes to each other.", "NTA.\n\nA blind rabbit would know that\u2019s not the way to tell a recently bereaved mother.\n\nThey should have come to your house and spoken to you privately, and told you when it would be announced publicly so you had the opportunity to decide to attend or not and to handle the news privately.\n\nYou lost a child 4 months ago.\nWhether they were newborn or 18 that\u2019s a trauma that pregnancy announcements can be expected to trigger.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make it about you and you didn\u2019t cause a scene. You did nothing wrong.", "The correct way to answer that text is not to. Let your silence speak. NTA", "NTA - I doubt she was thinking about why you didn't  congrats her - weird she confronted you tho\n\nBut Man being her twin Sitting there as she talking about how happy she wasn't actually having twins because one died - on their birthday - ooof", "YTA\n\nThis is almost certainly about you not liking her. And about your grief and jealousy. She has not done anything to you.", "NTA, neither of you are,  but I think you have definitely rubbed each other the wrong way. And wow, yeah, those were inside thoughts, but maybe social grace is not her strong point in the best of circumstances.  I think, if you felt up to it, you could say that you were sorry that you couldn't get it together to be happy for her in that moment in light of your recent loss and that you really do wish her all the very best.  Because you probably would if you weren't kinda grossed out.  Things will be easier in the future if you can extend a little grace and smooth it over and let her do her.", "NTA\n\nRegardless of how SIL is or isn't coping or how she's actually feeling about the loss (which people are speculating that she's devastated and trying to cope, but we've no proof either for or against that claim), a person doesn't get to be completely insensitive to anothers feelings and then *still* hound them about being sensitive to theirs.  \n\nHad OP just wondered if she was the ah for not being more outwardly happy for the sil, then it would be n a h/e s h.  But SIL didn't seem to consider for even a second how triggering and painful the experience would be for her family members who suffered such a terrible loss, but then felt entitled to their response being excited and outwardly joyous to the point that she confronted them about it after the fact?  No self reflection from SIL.  Not a moment to consider how someone else was feeling.  Being hurt by their reaction is totally understandable, confronting them with that hurt without a moment to consider that they might also be hurt makes her T A H.", "NTA, you are still in the process of morning a child passing. This was not a miscarriage or a stillbirth, but the loss of a child.  Take time away from his family.  When they only realize that you were not hugging and acting happy for her and ignored your pain.  Did your MIL and FIL know you were in labor during the wedding?  If so, did they call and check on you during this time.", "NTA", "**Wow.** How tone deaf can you get? SIL needed to read the room.", "ESH", "NTA I am so sorry about your son.", "Anyone who calls you Y T A is absolutely wrong. I am honestly confused on what my vote should be, because on the one hand, you both lost kids, so I feel like this could be your sil's way of coping. On the other hand, if she felt like you weren't happy, she could have simply tried to sympathize with you, because she was being \" happy\" about losing a baby and it wouldn't be fair on you. NAH, because the situation is horrible for both of you.", "Yeah I\u2018m going to go with NTA. Your SIL is not an asshole for not being upset over losing one of the embryos. She\u2019s entitled to have her own feelings about all of that, and if she\u2019s good, then all the better. *You* however just had an unexpected stillbirth what, three months ago? In my opinion, she and they as a couple should have been *way* more considerate of that than they were.\n\nWhen I was pregnant there were a couple of people in our immediate family/close circle of friends who we knew it could be sensitive for (because of infertility issues we were aware of, as well as distressing recent pregnancy loss). We told them privately and made it very clear we didn\u2019t need them to act all excited for us if they weren\u2019t in that place yet. One of the people we told that way was one of our siblings, because she was grieving something of her own. I would have just publicly dropped the news on her like that, just out of care for her feelings.\n\nIn my eyes, that\u2019s the bare minimum. If you know your *brother* just lost his baby during their birth, you don\u2019t spring a happy, group-setting pregnancy announcement on him and his wife and quip about pregnancy loss flippantly. That\u2019s just completely insensitive. Weirds me tf out that so many people in the comments think that\u2019s normal behaviour, who raised you?", "NTA  \nTell her you're not happy about the way she acted either so all in all it's a draw.   \nShe is self centered and insensitive. Great combination.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe is soulless, this is not something that you can fix.", "Soft YTA.  My daughter was stillborn and my SIL became pregnant soon after.  I found out with the rest of the family and offered congratulations.  I was in therapy after my loss and that is where I dealt with my feelings.  I hope you are also in therapy to help you through.  No one owes you a special announcement.  She said to you when you announced before 12 weeks and what she said about her own loss are common ideas and not examples of cruelty.  Wouldn\u2019t you have felt saddened if you simultaneously announced your first pregnancy/the loss of the twin and your ILs offered no condolence or congratulations at all? I don\u2019t know how close you are but if you found her not telling you beforehand a bit insensitive, your lack of reaction was a lot insensitive.  Again, I hope you find a way to process your grief/jealousy.  If you are open about your experience, you will discover that so many women have experienced miscarriage/stillbirth and helps make it less isolating.", "NTA, mourning, grieving, and overcoming come at different times and through different emotions. While I thought her comment lacked empathy ( announcing in a group setting knowing that you suffered a loss). She handled it differently. \nIt is somewhat disappointing that you don\u2019t have her as a pedestal of strength to lean on since her loss doesn\u2019t include sadness or grief. And it\u2019s hard to have someone to openly talk to without judgment or egotistical. \nYou are not wrong for feeling the way you do, healing the way you do, and grieving the way you do. When and if you  wish to congratulate her, you will.. and you shouldn\u2019t be pressure to do it in a certain way or within a time period or in-front of others \nVery sorry for your loss.", "NTA if she gives information in a not ideal setting, she can't get upset about how people do or don't respond. Also if you didn't want the possibility of having twins then don't have kids? Like that's always a possibility.", "NTA\n\nI would have left. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re close so you have no right to know before the announcement. Not congratulating someone at their weird combo miscarriage celebrating/pregnancy announcement is fine. I would have just left because that\u2019s weird af.", "NAH\n\n>  her happiness about loosing [sic] a child left me speechless\n\nShe only lost a fetus, tho. It's just cells.", "YTA for not congratulating your SIL on her pregnancy. \n\nThe woman is still pregnant with your niece/nephew. She may have a different outlook on the twin they lost compared to the child that you lost because they lost them so early. Your baby died after birth! After all the reassurances of their survival over the 9 months you carried them! Her's died from what I assume to be what she may have been preparing since last November when it was the only time she let the inside thoughts out from your post. Not to mention the fact that they could have waited until they were ready to announce so had ample time to process. They could have even wanted to relieve the pain of the death of one of their twins so they could celebrate the survival of the other with family. It doesn't mean that they think that your loss or ANY LOSS is lucky.\n\nFrom your post you didn't even mention she didn't even seem insensitive to your loss of your child on the day of the loss. The only insensitive thing she said was remarking on the announcement, but it could have been because she was worried about your haste. It shouldn't warrant this reaction without other instances of insensitivity towards your second child.", "as a mother of twins, she is right to be relieved not to be having them. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.", "NAH\n\nHoney, she isn't actually happy. You know that, right?\n\nShe's having a complicated fucked up stew of emotions.\nShe is overjoyed to be a mom, and doesn't know how to feel that at the same time she's feeling the crushing loss of possibility of losing a baby, especially since she IS a twin and some piece of her is realizing it could have been her (or her sister) and how precious their connection is and and and.... Overwhelming joy AND mourning at the same time is a really hard combination to manage.\n\nShe's running at the mouth because she's overwhelmed.\n\nBe patient and kind with your own grief, and with hers.

This reminds me of when my cousin left our Christmas party frantically and rudely because she lost her baby early on in pregnancy and saw my aunt pregnant at the party and made her husband get up and take her home\u2026. We were all worried and wondering where she was and SHE was the entire talk of the night \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f a great way to put a sad aura around everyone and my aunt\u2019s pregnancy. She felt horrible for just being pregnant. I get trauma and triggers but there\u2019s was no reason to not congratulate them.", "OMG people, read the room! No you are not the ah she sounds pretty dense and insensitive - sorry you went through that. Like I'm kinda anti-people and don't like offering congratulations in general because it's like saying \"good job at sex\" but for her to get so bent out of shape after that approach to her announcement knowing full well what you went through, I'd  e a little confused and frankly pissed off - nah... Hell nah!", "YTA\n\ngrow up", "YTA", "YTA. This is not about you. Nothing she said was openly malicious. It's not like she was gloating about her baby when you've lost yours, or actually wishing your baby wouldn't survive. She just sounds like someone who lacks tact. You, on the other hand, are taking everything personally and actively refusing to wish her well. It sounds to me like she's just trying to put on a positive face and convince herself to turn the horrible thing that's happened to her into a positive. You're a mother, you should know. No sane mother actually WANTS to lose a child. You're the one being insensitive and only looking at this from your perspective. If you truly love and care for her like a sister, you would still go up and congratulate her for the good news, and then excuse yourselves from the party, process your negative feelings, and let her know how you felt later. Not openly and passive aggressively not congratulate her in front of everyone.", "NAH. I can understand why you reacted the way that you did in the moment. I would tell her that you were a bit taken aback by the conversation around the loss of the second fetus. However if you can truly be happy for her after the fact then tell her you are. If you aren\u2019t truly happy for her now that the moment has passed I\u2019d ask you to evaluate why. You can absolutely deal with your own grief and still be happy for someone else. That doesn\u2019t negate your perfectly valid grief over losing your child if that is your concern.", "NAH presently, but you are teetering on the brink with your grief policing. If she can turn the loss of one of the twins into a good thing in her mind, let her.", "Neither of you are AH. Youre hurting and she's over the moon. You both lost a child but she still has one to focus on which must be very hard for you. Im so sorry for your loss", "NAH, for reasons other have said. I would maybe be honest with her and text back something like hey, I'm really sorry to have dulled your moment. I'm still grieving, but I'm still really excited for you and my brother, etc etc", "NAH. She may be acting that way for coping with her loss, or he may be feeling that way. Eitherway, you should explain why you reacted that way and congratulate her later, and she should accept how you acted due to your grief", "NAH people deal with grief differently, and while a heads up might have been nice, she wasn't obligated to give you one. I would let this go as i dont think something like this should permanently change your relationship", "NTA and I'm sorry for your loss OP. I hope you and your family grieve and attain peace. \n\nFor what it's worth, I function like your sister in law. When something really hard happens I try to express joy and relief at the \"positive side\" of things. I haven't been able to conceive and I happily told my friends that if IVF does not work I'll be a super doting aunt to every one of their kids and that I'll adopt a ton of animals...I looked and sounded happy and excited, even relieved...it does not mean that I am not emotionally destroyed at the failure of past attempts, at the terror of the possible failure of the future attemps, at the sorrow of possibly never having a human family of my own. People outside do not see the destruction inside. Everybody copes anyway they can. Your SIL might be grieving the loss of her second twin and refusing to show it and give in to these emotions. She might also be scared of affecting the health of her second baby if she dares to be unhappy. You kind of get crazy when pregnant. I stopped eating anything processed or unhealthy as soon as being pregnant was a possibility, I repressed any negative emotion in hope that I'd flood my baby with happy serene hormones...I was terrified of loosing this pregnancy...and I did. And once I did, I was back to normal. Try not to see it as an attack on her unborn child or a minimization of your loss but most probably as a coping mechanism.\nI wish you the best OP.", "NAH, I don't know what's really going on in SIL's mind, but attempting to rationalize something completely irrational (like a miscarriage or infant death) sounds like a coping mechanism. She is likely grieving hard but publicly putting on a brave face. You are not an AH for not wanting to celebrate a pregnancy as you are still grieving yourself.", "NAH - neither of you did anything wrong, I am sorry you went through such a traumatic experience.\n\nIf you are happy for them I would just congratulate her now\n\nEdit: I should clarify. No assholes here, but you are in the wrong here OP. I would apologize to SIL but you don\u2019t really have to.", "NAH\n\nSo she doesn't have to be upset about her miscarriage.  She doesn't owe you that.  She gets to have her own emotions.  Some people don't get bothered by that.  Some do.  \n\nYou were offended that she wasn't in pain about something that happened in her body.   I get that you're still dealing with your own grief, but that's her body and her potential child.

I get why she's offended that you just left.", "NAH as some other people said everyone reacts to trauma different. Even though they are similar experiences she is still having a different experience than you. I can also understand the feelings of wanting to have been let know or the jealousy. \n\nI went through something similar, and my fianc\u00e9s cousin announced her pregnancy at a family get together 3 months after we lost our son. It\u2019s her right to do so, but I also felt speechless and it did trigger me being so soon. I had to leave. I later received a message that she was hurt and didn\u2019t realize I was still so fragile over what happened. I don\u2019t speak to her anymore. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happening to you OP. The pain will never go away, but small steps and time will help to dull it.", "NAH but I doubt SIL is really happy to have lost one of the twins. More than anything it's likely she's putting on a brave face trying to convince herself that everything will be alright.", "NAH on the surface, but like the teeny tiniest yta. You\u2019ve both gone through losses this year and your trying to cope and carry on for your surviving children. Yes SIL said something idiotic when you announced your pregnancy, but as someone who had never been pregnant at that time chances are high that the states was rooted in ignorance rather than malice. Also calling you ahead of time would have been very considerate, but if you already don\u2019t have the best relationship she may have not known how to broach the subject. SIL is a twin so of course she\u2019s upset that her baby won\u2019t have their twin to go through life with. Grief makes you rationalize really weird things. You and your husband completely disregarding the announcement is a bit tasteless. Nobody is saying that you had to jump for joy, but a simple \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have gone a long way.", "She is handling her loss her way. Handle yours your way. She had no need to tell you first or to handle grief in the way you would prefer. \nYTA", "Give her the link to this story and perhaps she will understand", "Nah for your response. But yta for judging someone on how they're dealing with a loss. Maybe she's relieved because the thought of raising two kids at once was overwhelming?\n\nJust trying to say, you never truly know what someone is going through or thinking.", "Hey OP. NAH. Although I do think your SIL could have and should have given you a heads up about her pregnancy announcement. However, I\u2019ve learned, the hard way, that a lot of people don\u2019t understand miscarriage, stillbirth, loss of children, and because of this often don\u2019t understand how things like this can impact those who have been through them.\n\nAt the same time, I can also tell you, again from experience, that it\u2019s very likely she says that about the loss because it helps her to cope and be okay with it. It\u2019s hard when you are living through grief, and dealing with the pregnancy hormones at the same time, to fully understand the implications of how those words impact someone else. Doesn\u2019t make it okay though, just explaining where she might have been coming from.", "We can't have children because I can't give one to my wife. So I think it's a bad reaction from her. There are people with everything and some with nothing. That's life happening. I think you could congrat her about her pregnancy but saying that she shouldn't talk like that about losing a twin. It's gross. So yeah. It's a mixed feeling.", "YTA. She likely is upset about losing the twin but is trying not to let the sad part overtake the celebration of the surviving twin. She wants to share her happiness and not her sadness. You are just too bitter at your own grief to feel happiness for someone else.", "I would like to understand why being told in a group bothered you? \n\nI think you are projecting your loss. People can STILL be happy to be having a baby. The loss seems early enough that the emotional attachment can be acknowledged and moving on to the wellbeing of the other fetus. \n\nShe didn't lose a baby. She lost a fetus. I know this might give me a little hate.", "Loosing a child? I know it\u2019s a typo but what a phrase.", "My response is usually \u201cgross\u201d", "Sounds like the happy about not buying two of everything is a cope \ud83d\ude33 she\u2019s probably really heartbroken, trying to convince herself that it\u2019s better this was. Either way, totally inappropriate and I\u2019d be offended too. Baby loss is not a joking matter, it\u2019s with you forever, and it\u2019s heartbreaking! \nMaybe talk to her. Tell her how you felt and see how she is really feeling and that obviously you are happy for them but still felt horrible. NTA.", "Nah. To her this child was never real. It was a glob of cells that was turning into a kid but never did.  So not that big a deal to her. Others see it as a child from the moment of conception. You grew your child and birthed a child.

I assumed widow but says husband", "There's a big difference between losing a child a few weeks into a pregnancy (and still have one) and at birth.

It's possible she isn't devastated by the loss...not all women have that reaction to a very early miscarriage; who are we to tell other women to *be sadder*. \n\nOr she may just be trying to find the positive in a situation that did in fact affect her. \n\nWe don't know exactly...but I'm certain that we shouldn't be policing how other women react. You deal with it your way, she deals with it her way. I'm not sure any of this is reason not to offer your congratulations.", "NAH - so so sorry for your loss. We came extraordinarily close to losing our baby at birth and it was just pure horror. I can\u2019t imagine your pain. It sounds like she\u2019s speaking in this way about the loss as means to cope with it. I\u2019m sure her initial feelings were not happiness and this is how she\u2019s decided she\u2019s going to manage her emotions and get through it. She does sound like she has a bit of diarrhea of the mouth though- based on both comments she had made.", "NAH, I would find her comments very of putting too and probably be pinching myself to make sure I wasn\u2019t in the twilight zone. If someone says they\u2019re pregnant, I\u2019d say congratulations.. but if they said, \u201cI was pregnant with twins, but now it\u2019s just one because the other one died, thank goodness,\u201d I don\u2019t know how to respond to that either.", "NAH. You can feel however you feel but so can she - and there really wasn't a reason for SIL to give you a separate announcement of her pregnancy. She told everyone. The way she acts has nothing to do with you; she hasn't said anything snide or personal, just shared her perspective on what happened to her.\n\nMaybe it's a front. Or maybe it's not and she is genuinely happy not to be having twins. Not everyone wants that. Not everyone sees a miscarriage as a traumatic event. \n\nNo one's being mean or offensive here.", "NAH you deal with things differently. Such is life.

As you said, I would have hoped she would tell you separately considering your very fresh grief, but that can be excused - she may not have thought to be tactful in her excitement. Where the SIL is TA is for chastising you for your reaction. I lost a baby in the 2nd trimester, and even without her comments that felt triggering to you, I still don't know how I would have reacted to a pregnancy announcement so soon after.

My second child also died at birth completely unexpectedly and I almost died in the process and I lost my ability to have children. My only child and I are so close, best friends, and it's just the two of us. I have said positive things about how we get to live our lives because he's an only child. Advantages to doing more activities, etc. But of course I would much rather my second child had lived.

It is often from self protection about the fear the other twin may be in danger .  I just say consider it a possibility, Women in her case often talk about the difficulty of explaining the same situation . To grieve and feel joy simultaneously. I have been with these women", "She is allowed to react to the loss of the child however she wants. I lost a twin in my pregnancy & acted like I was happy about it to ppl but really I was super sad inside but only talked about how we really could only afford one/ it\u2019d be easier etc. at my bday party I certainly wouldn\u2019t be dwelling on my loss, especially when I had a healthy other child I wanted to focus on & be happy about. I am very sorry for your loss, but I wouldn\u2019t be judging her for that.

The fact that she didn\u2019t give you a heads up is hurtful, those two things can both be true and I\u2019m not sure why people are upset with you for being hurt. She\u2019s a local family member who knows you suffered a tragic loss 4 months ago. As you\u2019ve said, in your position you gave her feelings (her wedding day) consideration despite the trauma you were suffering. And here she couldn\u2019t relate two pregnancy/baby related life events together and maybe give you a heads-up? \n\nAll that to say, if she\u2019s someone you want to keep in your life, talk it out with her. No accusations necessary. Give her the benefit of the doubt, and share where your mind was at. What if she wanted to tell you but didn\u2019t know how to bring it up\u2026? Didn\u2019t want you to feel left out of the announcement and just (dimly, in my opinion) tried not to think of the consequences? What if the loss of a fetus was, in her mind, so minuscule/relieving financially that it didn\u2019t even CROSS her mind to relate it to your loss of a birthed child? What if it IS just her way of dealing with loss (focusing on the \u201cupside\u201d if there is one, which is a valid way for her to feel but also validly jarring for you to hear)? \n\nBUT if her response is any amount of callousness about your pain, then maybe it\u2019s time to rethink her role in your life. \n\nGood luck.

The fear is there now.  At least it was for me.  Plus, the next one ended up being a high risk.  Thankfully, we both made it through the pregnancy safely.  Hope you do ok on yours.", "Thank you for saying this.", "Oh! Yes, you\u2019re thinking of cognitive reframing.", "WTF does Tigger have to do with losing a twin????", "I have not been called names like that and am a reasonably warm person (I think) but I\u2019m a \u201cplan for the worst and hope for the best\u201d decision maker. \n\nPeople tend to look for info that supports their feelings and opinions rather than just the data; the stats I read at the time would lean me to selective reduction. Now it\u2019s been a few years, so if I was trying to get pregnant or was pregnant I\u2019d re-examine the situation.", "I'm happy you haven't experienced a loss/death of a child. People who have all experience it differently and having empathy is never a bad thing.", "I don't get this line of thinking honestly. Someone I cared about lost a baby much like OP. I can't imagine doing anything related to pregnancy etc without having a conversation with them first because I care about them. This isn't some stranger. This is family. When you are close with and care about another person you do things for them to ease their pain and emotional hardships. Don't forget the baby died for OP only a few months ago. Why wouldn't you consider her when announcing your pregnancy?", "It would be one thing if OP had requested sensitivity around this topic rather than expecting it by default. If she had said to her sister \"this loss is very hard for me so if you happen to announce a pregnancy in the near future, please be considerate and leave me out of it\" then fine, NTA. \n\nBut I completely agree that you can't expect people to tip-toe around your feelings by default, because people are concerned about themselves and their immediate partner/family most of the time, not everyone else. (And I she is starting a family with her partner, she likely isn't considering anyone outside that at the moment)\n\nWhile OP's feelings are valid. ESH. Everyone sucks here. Because she and her husband were still pretty callous to the occasion.", "I'd consider it pretty close. Even we had the decency not to call anyone on the day our child died because she was celebrating her wedding.", "As someone who lost their parents pretty young, if my friends were tip toeing around me by not talking about them or not talking about their parents, I would be quite put off, not gonna lie. \n\nIt sucks, grief sucks, but you can't live your life being afraid to face it, and just keep burying it until it eats you alive.", ">There are generally agreed upon reactions that people expect when giving good news.\n\nExcept pregnancy isn't universally considered good news. And the loss of a fetus also isn't universally (or even usually) considered good news. People are not robots.\n\n>Expecting a heads up before a pregnancy announcement is made is not a normal thing to expect.\n\nIn a general sense, sure. But SIL was well aware that OP and her  brother lost a child less than 4 months ago. It's pretty common to give someone you're close to a heads up in writing instead of in person if they were either previously experiencing infertility or recently lost a baby. Even more so if you start including discussions of pregnancy loss. And if you don't give them that and they don't react perfectly, then yes you need to give them a little grace. It's not like OP or her husband said anything negative. They just weren't openly joyful. SIL initiated the conversation instead of thinking \"oh maybe they're still having a tough time\". I cannot even imagine sending that message to my own brother in that situation.", "Okay! Okay yeah. Thank you for your response. I think we are on the same page :) it\u2019s definitely not on anyone else to manage OUR triggers but like you said, reactions happen to everyone. But as a human we GET to have the opportunity to then rethink and respond, rather than just throw our hands up at a reaction and let things fester without communication or empathy. That\u2019s a breeding ground for resentment for both sides!\n\nETA: In my own life, I became super sensitive to stuff around marriage and dating after I blew-up my own engagement and it definitely was hard to navigate those feelings as a wedding guest/party member. I never took it out on anyone though! Just became super aware that I might start crying without notice and had a plan for myself to exit the situation quietly if I became inconsolable. But of course, the end of an engagement <<<<<<<< death. So I wasn\u2019t sure if I was being TOO too moderate about OP\u2019s situation.", "Okay, now look up active versus passive lol", "Where does it say that's how she was acting??", "I\u2019m with you. And since when was \u201cchildless\u201d an insult?", "She directly made conflicting comments, stating both that she would act right if she knew and that if she knew she wouldn't have been there at all. It's not that I don't feel empathy I'm not daft, but rather that I don't believe her grief gives her an excuse to be an AH.\n\n Her sister lost her child, and regardless of OP's situation, she has the right to react however, which would help her grieve. Maybe if this was a one on one then I'd say otherwise, but this seemed to be a party situation with multiple people in which OP could quietly excuse herself if it bothered her. She didn't and then sis expressed that OP staying there not saying anything bothered her. \n\nI mean OP herself has admitted to not caring to understand her sister's point of view. She is a twin herself and lost one of them. Understandably, she may feel something contrary to what she is expressing publicly, but doesn't want to make herself upset because of the other baby. In this situation, OP was the asshole, but it is understandable given the situation. I don't however excuse her for it.", "I'm really sorry for your loss. I miscarried at 6 weeks in July, first pregnancy after three fucking years of trying. I cried a lot while it was happening, but I'm not devastated. At least now I know that conception and implantation are possible, and pretty much any miscarriage that early wasn't ever viable to begin with. It gave me a level of peace I haven't had in a couple of years, and I'm grateful for that. But it also in no way was as bad as when my mom died 2 days after I turned 18. Wasn't as bad as my grandpa or grandma dying either. It did hurt worse than when my mom's mom died, but that woman hated me my whole life for not being a boy. \n\nI just... I don't want any woman to feel like they shouldn't be sad, but I also don't want myself or any other woman to feel shamed for \\*not\\* being devastated either, if that makes sense?", "That was the point of the comment they were replying to, that woman reacts and feels differently about miscarriages. When I had mine, I was so relieved and happy. Felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. My, and all other women's experiences are just as valid as yours.", "I have lost three pregnancies and not once did it make me feel more than slightly bummed. Two\nWe\u2019re at only 6 weeks and one was at 13 weeks. I have two healthy children and am 16 weeks currently. I\u2019ve lost both my parents at 21 and 24 years old and those deaths almost destroyed me and still hurt. I can\u2019t imagine grieving a fetus I never knew more than a human that raised me. That\u2019s wild.", "It's so hard. I remember asking my job if I could get bereavement; that was denied because there was no funeral to plan. So I went back to work the day after my D&C. Looking back I probably should have asked for a medical excuse. Miscarriage for a wanted pregnancy is heartbreaking. I'm sorry for your loss.", "Thank you.", "It's always there. I'm always preparing for bad news and really don't know how to handle the good news. Maybe in time. It's going good so far.", "Thank you. I'll correct it.", "In the tigger movie he always says the wonderful thing about tiggers is I\u2019m the only one! And he\u2019s happy that he\u2019s special, but then sees a picture of other tiggers and gets very excited to have a tigger family. He imagines what they\u2019re like, and how much they will love him. And then that doesn\u2019t work out, he doesn\u2019t have a family and he is the only tigger. And he has to accept that he is the only tigger but he does have a family in the other hundred acre woods animals. And he has to deal with the loss of what he could have had. And I\u2019m crying now lol", "Tigger's whole thing is how he's the only one like him", "It's part of his song \"the wonderful thing about Tigger is I'm the only one!\" Or something along those lines. I think that's what they were referring to", "You\u2019re making a big assumption there. Just because I hold my opinion does not mean that I haven\u2019t had my own struggles. I have empathy, my view being different from yours does not mean I do not. \ud83d\ude02", "What does that have to do with this situation? Did you leave out this secretly having also happened at your wedding? What does you not spoiling her wedding day have to do with her announcing her pregnancy on a day that had nothing to do with you?", "Like, I'm genuinely sorry for what you experienced, but your SIL isn't a bad person, and I'd examine why you need her to be in order to feel better/superior/more validated in your grief.", "I am not sure why you are getting downvoted.", "> now look up active versus passive\n\nWhy? They don't make any difference to if someone is unsupportive or supportive. It's non sequiter.\n\nIf I do nothing at all, or if I kick you in the stomach - either way I am being unsupportive.\n\nThe word means what the word means, it's binary - true or false.", "She says in her post she stayed there quiet while everyone congradulated her SIL, i used the wrong words, but still, she should have removed herself from the situation", "Yes.  I guess get a little aggressive when I feel people minimalizing the possible grief of miscarriage.  I wish people hadn't been so blah about me being devastated about it.  Being told to go to work the next day as if nothing happened.  Telling me not to talk about it because it's not like you knew the child and just get over it.", "I think her point was more that they extended her basic consideration and she doesn\u2019t feel she was extended that same level of consideration, which is valid. She wasn\u2019t entitled to it, but she\u2019s allowed to feel some type of way about the lack of consideration by her family member."]}
