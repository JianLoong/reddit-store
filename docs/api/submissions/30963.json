He has 3 siblings, he's the youngest, and she doesn't act like this with any of her other kids.\n\nAnyways, shortly after announcing the pregnancy she starts showering my husband with gifts (jewelry, money, literal romance cards) saying \"you won't be able to buy yourself anything for awhile so I want to make sure you're spoiled\". Started talking about our bedroom life or how we got pregnant (\"well clearly you like bending people over\"). Started calling him babe/baby/daddy. But it was never an excitement over her being a grandmother. She told everyone she was \"indifferent\" about the pregnancy (all her other kids have several children but my MIL is acting weird about our baby, not her other kids babies). Anyways, she shows up in L/D and tried making my husband sit on the couch with her while I was having contractions because she \"needed to make sure he was good\" and I watched her rub/squeeze his inner thighs multiple times. Every time she did, he immediately moved away from her and you could tell it was bothering him but he didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward to 2 days ago. She comes by, unannounced per usual, and when she shows up she immediately smacks my husband's ass which is completely out of character for her. He says \"wtf mom\" and she laughs and says \"what?\" Then he was sitting and holding the baby and she came up behind him and started hugging him from behind with her full body pressed to him and said \"she looks just like us\" (him and his mom look NOTHING alike). He just kind of looked at her and then looked at me and without thinking, I said \"hey MIL, have you ever heard of emotional inc*st? If not, maybe look it up and correct your behavior because if this continues you won't be allowed back here\". I don't want her near my kid if she's acting this weird. She makes me uncomfortable. My husband immediately shoots me a look. She plays dumb, ends up leaving 10 minutes later. My husband won't talk to me about it at all (literally refuses). AITA?\n\nETA: I have talked to my husband about it at least twice and I told him I was going to say something if he didn't. That was months ago, prior to having the baby. He obviously didn't think I was serious. I don't want this behavior around my child at all.

What you're describing is full-on sexual harassment. \n\nI get that you're trying to be judicious with your words, because that's your MIL. But she's not just being inappropriately cuddly with him, or asking him to take a \"husbandly\" role in her life. She is sexually harassing him: openly groping him in a sexual manner, making blatantly sexual remarks, and with the comment about \"she looks just like us\" my first thought was that she meant \"...if they'd made a baby together\". \n\nIt seems like she has taken a deeply inappropriate interest in your husband's *virility*, specifically, since you became pregnant. You say that she has other kids and grandkids. Are any of her other kids sons? And just how old is she? Because honestly, if this is a marked and sudden change in her behaviour, that's a possible sign of the onset of dementia. And no, I'm not trying to armchair-diagnose. But as someone who has been through an Alzheimer's diagnosis with an older relative, aggressive and inappropriately sexual behaviour from someone who was always well-mannered previously is like, a CLASSIC sign.\n\nBut if she's under 60 or so (and even that would be early-onset), then she's just behaving like a sexual predator. And it's okay to say that: \"Your behaviour is very inappropriate. It makes me uncomfortable. You are sexually harassing my husband, your son, and I don't know where your comments and groping are coming from, but they are not okay  or welcome in this home. I think maybe you need to talk to a therapist about the inappropriate way you've been interacting with \\[husband\\] since we got pregnant.\" \n\nNo matter what, you are very much NTA.", "Yikes. Its such a trip that there are moms like this out there.\n\nI remember the night of my senior prom, one of the guys I was sharing a limo with was a starter on the football team, one of the most popular guys in school, etc. When we were posing with our dates for a photo before we hopped in the limo, his mom ran up for one last photo w him and then *grabbed his crotch* in front of everybody. As in, fully cupped it. For a second or two. While everybody was watching. \n\nShe clearly had the same feelings OP\u2019s MIL has, seeing her son with that girl. Not sure what twisted Freudian logic that is, but yeah. \n\nPoor guy looked mortified, nobody said anything, and we all went to prom like nothing had happened. Nobody ever looked at his mom the same way again, though. Always wondered what kind of creepy shit he had to deal with in his home life during those high school years.\n\nAnyway yeah obvs big NTA.

Is your MIL like this now with all her children or is it just your husband? Have you or any of your husband's family noticed any other kinds of changes in your MIL's personality or behaviour outside of this?\n\nI see two possibilities, either your MIL has been hiding her true personality from you or something has happened to her, but sudden inappropriate sexual behaviour in an adult who has never shown signs of it before often indicates a medical problem, and it could be anything from a UTI to a small stroke to dementia. It's not by any means certain that that's the case. but if this really is a new development then at the very least she needs to be examined by her doctor to rule out a physical cause.

It reallllllly makes me wonder about your husband's childhood and/or your MIL's.\n\nI can completely understand why your husband is refusing to talk about this, though. Either this is the first time his mother has shown behavior like this and he's in denial/scared/unsure what to do, or this is bringing up stuff from his childhood that he's got buried deep down inside.

Emotional incest is more along the lines of a parent turning their child into their therapist or acting like they\u2019re their partner in an emotional sense.

You need to talk to your husband about this and tell him to stand up for himself when this sort of behavior occurs. He may be uncomfortable or even angry with it, but you need to tell him nonetheless. \n\n\nFinally, keep her away from the baby.

She's finally back in his life and being from what your story seems a \"good\" mom up until this point.  That is potentially a massive void he carried for 13 years filled.  Now all of that is being threatened once again by moms at best questionable behavior.  Something he may feel he can fix by not acknowledging it exists.  If he doesn't complain than she's not violating him, or that's how I see his potential thought process.  Desperately trying to keep what he had loss before.  \n\nFrom his behavior I think it'll be a tough egg to crack.  I'd lead into the conversation as gentle as possible even though the situation makes me uncomfortable because I'd think his actions are coming f5om a place of trauma and not maliciousness.  And even if its unfair its very hard to get through trauma with anger and accusations.  I don't necessarily think you have a responsibility to do that, but if you care about your partner enough to be there through their trauma sometimes that what it takes.\n\n This conversation needs to happen, tell him that you can give him time to put himself together for it but the conversation will need to happen and you're not going to let it go without at least talking about it openly. As a partner you do have a right to talk about the things that bother you, and his job is to at very least have that conversation and hear you out, maybe not agree but it needs to at least happen.  I always try to emphasize the conversation is about resolution and not blame or fault to try and keep my partner from feeling defensive.  \n\nHopefully this helps in some regard and I'm not just preaching to the choir.\n\nEdit: just to add I saw another comment of yours how he asks never to talk about it.  He needs to know the issue has extended past himself.  This is hurting you, and you NEED to talk about the things hurting you.", "It's super weird. Maybe now that your husband knows you mean business and will say something to her, he'll be more proactive about it so it doesn't come to that. But if not, then he's kind of left you no choice.

He's a man, he has been taught never to get aggressive with women. And yet his mother is literally sexually harassing him. So he is stuck in the horrific position of being groped and harassed and basically sexually abused by his own mom as a grown man. That's bloody traumatising.

Brain tumors are terrifying.", "not taking responsibility for acting on a legitimate theory *doesn't* make it an excuse or ridiculous. The idea that there is no point in discussing it unless you were going to do that, would have merit if he were always the one bringing the conversation up, and for the times he does sure. But sharing your theory in response to someone else brining the actions up up is really a point in itself", "Your first point was on target re brain damage. If the parts of the brain that cover impulse control or socially conditioned behaviors start to deteriorate (either via dementia or some other tumor/injury) then the person taking the actions doesn\u2019t realize they are doing anything wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty awful for all concerned.", "I am not a neurologist, but I think it has something to do with the plaque buildup and where it occurs in the brain.  Wires get crossed. Something similar can happen with brain tumors and tbi. If a specialist sees this and I am incorrect, please correct me.", "people forget that they aren't supposed to behave like that.", "As I understand it (as someone whose grandparents have it) dementia is a form of brain damage and it \"crosses wires\" so to speak, and removes their filter. So, while we non-dementia people may see someone attractive and think, \"Oh wow, he/she is really sexy,\" it's a passing thought that we keep to ourselves. A dementia patient can lose that, and they'll have that thought, speak it aloud, and garnish it with a little butt-slap or something. But, it's not always sexual. Some folks just speak very obscenely, or they'll begin sharing racist thoughts and so forth. It's very frustrating and sad.", "So happy you had a nurse like that! I have no plans to announce to anyone that I'm in labor, outside of my husband, my doula, and my midwife team haha", "It's stories like that that make it all worth it. I'm glad you had someone on your side and I hope my patients remember me as fondly.", "Nurses are amazing!\n\nWhat a wonderful story.", "Mine too! That nurse also stitched up my mom because the doctor was \u201ca dumbass.\u201d", "Sorry you had to do that, and I'm glad you had the backup and a memory like that to to it off!\n\nWishing you and your little fam well :)", "My medical support was absolutely amazing before and after delivery. I was on bed rest for about a month before kiddo came and I couldn\u2019t have tolerated it without them. They kept everyone out, snuck me extra pizza, tolerated my tantrums about needing showers.. From the cleaning ladies who sat with me and told me stories about their own preemies, to the residents who goofed around with me during ultrasounds in the middle of the night, to the doctor who did my strep test and then hung out to watch an episode of Battlestar Galactica \ud83e\udd23.. I\u2019ll never stop being grateful to those awesome people.\n\nMy mom delivered cookies, cake, fudge, muffins, chocolate, etc every day to the nurses\u2019 station lol. Bribes never hurt!", "Impulsivity.\n\nThey can do something really inappropriate and Then realize it was inappropriate later on their own  or after some discussion when somebody brings it up.  They can get embarrassed or angry when they realize they did something \u201cbad.\u201d Until the dementia gets worse.", "I wonder if kimarie is baffled by \u201clater chance \u2014 long before I met him,\u201d because I sure was.", "OK-if it was in the 70s there was still a strong Hippie Element around in some Families where all the members walked around each other nude .Ive seen some creepy Family photos like where one whole Family is lying on top of each other, one by one .\nNudity was \u201cgetting back to Nature\u201d.", ">(later chance- long before I met him)  \n>  \n>he said he kept because he still has both legs  \n>  \n>the fact that his SISTER you it was a bit creepy,\n\nI do not understand those bits. I do not know what \"later chance\" means, and is your husband an amputee? In the last bit were you trying to say his SISTER \"took\" it, instead of \"you it\"?\n\nThe fact that you did not see anything confusing is even more confusing.", "To clarify I do definitely think OP is absolutely right to refuse to see her MIL and to keep her child away from her. That is OP right, regardless of what her husband does and I do think it is the correct move for her child.\n\nI just think she should do what she can to support her husband in what must be a very distressing time for him. I do think there can be a balance between both enforcing her personal boundaries and helping her husband, especially if the husbands resistance is just a result of shock/overwhelm", "Thanks, yeah that makes sense. This always reminds me of that old meme about the brain.\n\n\"The brain is the most important organ in the human body... according to the brain!\"", "Thanks for explaining a bit more. That is really sad.", "Same. I'm nowhere near ready to have kids atm but I know when I do I plan on being a continent away from my family and if I decide to announce a pregnancy it will be a due 'season + year' with no other info to minimize prying", "My nurse L&D story was they didn't allow anyone in the room while giving the epidural. So rather than make me who was terrified of that needle(shout out to my husband for letting them know when I was in too much pain to tell them) the kindest nurse hugged me and held me. She promised it would be okay. It was. I didn't have to have anyone kicked out. Thankfully I got really lucky on that front.", "My hope for you is one of these times you're in a forum like this and someone tells a story and you realize it's about you \ud83e\udd17", "Mine second was born too fast and the nurse delivered her. She whispered to me conspiratorially afterwards \"Sometimes it's better of they're NOT here\".  Knowing the doctor on duty, she was absolutely right!", "Confusing to me, too.", "Not my husband! My understanding is that the photo was taken for an ex gf, they met later (hence later chance), he's an amputee, and his sister took the nude pic which was creepy"]}
