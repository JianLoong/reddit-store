He has 3 siblings, he's the youngest, and she doesn't act like this with any of her other kids.\n\nAnyways, shortly after announcing the pregnancy she starts showering my husband with gifts (jewelry, money, literal romance cards) saying \"you won't be able to buy yourself anything for awhile so I want to make sure you're spoiled\". Started talking about our bedroom life or how we got pregnant (\"well clearly you like bending people over\"). Started calling him babe/baby/daddy. But it was never an excitement over her being a grandmother. She told everyone she was \"indifferent\" about the pregnancy (all her other kids have several children but my MIL is acting weird about our baby, not her other kids babies). Anyways, she shows up in L/D and tried making my husband sit on the couch with her while I was having contractions because she \"needed to make sure he was good\" and I watched her rub/squeeze his inner thighs multiple times. Every time she did, he immediately moved away from her and you could tell it was bothering him but he didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward to 2 days ago. She comes by, unannounced per usual, and when she shows up she immediately smacks my husband's ass which is completely out of character for her. He says \"wtf mom\" and she laughs and says \"what?\" Then he was sitting and holding the baby and she came up behind him and started hugging him from behind with her full body pressed to him and said \"she looks just like us\" (him and his mom look NOTHING alike). He just kind of looked at her and then looked at me and without thinking, I said \"hey MIL, have you ever heard of emotional inc*st? If not, maybe look it up and correct your behavior because if this continues you won't be allowed back here\". I don't want her near my kid if she's acting this weird. She makes me uncomfortable. My husband immediately shoots me a look. She plays dumb, ends up leaving 10 minutes later. My husband won't talk to me about it at all (literally refuses). AITA?\n\nETA: I have talked to my husband about it at least twice and I told him I was going to say something if he didn't. That was months ago, prior to having the baby. He obviously didn't think I was serious. I don't want this behavior around my child at all.

What you're describing is full-on sexual harassment. \n\nI get that you're trying to be judicious with your words, because that's your MIL. But she's not just being inappropriately cuddly with him, or asking him to take a \"husbandly\" role in her life. She is sexually harassing him: openly groping him in a sexual manner, making blatantly sexual remarks, and with the comment about \"she looks just like us\" my first thought was that she meant \"...if they'd made a baby together\". \n\nIt seems like she has taken a deeply inappropriate interest in your husband's *virility*, specifically, since you became pregnant. You say that she has other kids and grandkids. Are any of her other kids sons? And just how old is she? Because honestly, if this is a marked and sudden change in her behaviour, that's a possible sign of the onset of dementia. And no, I'm not trying to armchair-diagnose. But as someone who has been through an Alzheimer's diagnosis with an older relative, aggressive and inappropriately sexual behaviour from someone who was always well-mannered previously is like, a CLASSIC sign.\n\nBut if she's under 60 or so (and even that would be early-onset), then she's just behaving like a sexual predator. And it's okay to say that: \"Your behaviour is very inappropriate. It makes me uncomfortable. You are sexually harassing my husband, your son, and I don't know where your comments and groping are coming from, but they are not okay  or welcome in this home. I think maybe you need to talk to a therapist about the inappropriate way you've been interacting with \\[husband\\] since we got pregnant.\" \n\nNo matter what, you are very much NTA.", "Yikes. Its such a trip that there are moms like this out there.\n\nI remember the night of my senior prom, one of the guys I was sharing a limo with was a starter on the football team, one of the most popular guys in school, etc. When we were posing with our dates for a photo before we hopped in the limo, his mom ran up for one last photo w him and then *grabbed his crotch* in front of everybody. As in, fully cupped it. For a second or two. While everybody was watching. \n\nShe clearly had the same feelings OP\u2019s MIL has, seeing her son with that girl. Not sure what twisted Freudian logic that is, but yeah. \n\nPoor guy looked mortified, nobody said anything, and we all went to prom like nothing had happened. Nobody ever looked at his mom the same way again, though. Always wondered what kind of creepy shit he had to deal with in his home life during those high school years.\n\nAnyway yeah obvs big NTA.

Is your MIL like this now with all her children or is it just your husband? Have you or any of your husband's family noticed any other kinds of changes in your MIL's personality or behaviour outside of this?\n\nI see two possibilities, either your MIL has been hiding her true personality from you or something has happened to her, but sudden inappropriate sexual behaviour in an adult who has never shown signs of it before often indicates a medical problem, and it could be anything from a UTI to a small stroke to dementia. It's not by any means certain that that's the case. but if this really is a new development then at the very least she needs to be examined by her doctor to rule out a physical cause.

It reallllllly makes me wonder about your husband's childhood and/or your MIL's.\n\nI can completely understand why your husband is refusing to talk about this, though. Either this is the first time his mother has shown behavior like this and he's in denial/scared/unsure what to do, or this is bringing up stuff from his childhood that he's got buried deep down inside.

Emotional incest is more along the lines of a parent turning their child into their therapist or acting like they\u2019re their partner in an emotional sense.

You need to talk to your husband about this and tell him to stand up for himself when this sort of behavior occurs. He may be uncomfortable or even angry with it, but you need to tell him nonetheless. \n\n\nFinally, keep her away from the baby.

Oh and NTA of course.", "NTA. Something weird is definitely going on. She needs a mental health check.", "That is odd, but I would also think that she should be checked out medically. There are some neurological disorders that can cause inappropriate behaviors. As it's onset was rather out of the blue, I would see if you could encourage a checkup.\n\nI would approach it with kindness as opposed to anger at this point.", "this one is kinda tricky because on one hand you are right to feel a certian way about her actions and I totally encorage communicating with people when they make you feel uncomforatable. But the way that you addressed it was definitely not the best. You shoulda sat down with her and explained what she was doing that made you uncomfortable and not just hit her with a sassy retort.", "NTA. Any chance your MIL might have early signs of dementia? Inappropriate behaviour is pretty common..", "NTA - Like many others have mentioned, my mind immediately went to dementia.  My grandfather had it, and sexual harassment was one of the symptoms.  He was in his 90's at this point and had not been sexually active (as far as we know) for several years prior, when my grandmother died.  Was wondering if FIL was in the picture.", "NTA. If this is a sudden change, she needs to be evaluated. She could have brain cancer or the early stages of dementia. She could also have been abusing him as a child. Either way, she needs to stay away until there\u2019s an answer for her behavior.", "NTA OP. But it's not just emotional incest, it's active sexual harassment and assault. Restraining order time, if it's possible for you.\n\nHe's likely been groomed to this, so he won't be as able to discern where the boundary should be. It's been deliberately eroded by her, quite probably in an escalating pattern.\n\nTalk it over with your husband, I'd bet there have been multiple incidents like this previously, just not as \"serious\". She's out of control.\n\nI have been in his shoes, ie the object of extremely inappropriate sexual attention from a parent. He'll be deeply, deeply ashamed and shut down about what's happening. He may attempt to minimise what's happening so he doesn't have to deal with the reality of how he's being victimised. Be patient with him. With her, exercise extreme prejudice. She's a loaded gun pointed at your family.", "NTA ew ew ew ew ew, no. No. Get him some therapy and get her out.", "NTA you gave him a chance to say something and he didn\u2019t so props to you", "You need to fix your husband problem.

Unfortunately, you've got a husband problem.", "NTA but your attention in this matter should be mostly on your husband.  He has to understand what is happening to him.  I had a similar issue with my mother that I didn't realize until my then wife pointed out how effed up the childhood stories I told were.  My mother never did anything physical to me but she was often inappropriate.  I never discussed it with her and I'm raising my child on the other side of the country so I don't have to worry about her with my kid.  \n\n\nTread carefully", "NTA- However, not to excuse your MIL's behavior but is it possible she has suffered a stroke or is developing dementia?

Could be dementia.", "Came to say this. She doesn't even have to be in her 60's, especially if she's a drinker the onset is earlier and overt sexuality or predatory behavior out of seemingly nowhere is one of the biggest early signs. Not trying to diagnose or anything just worked in dementia care forever and it's a huge indicator and often why peope put grandma/grandpa in a home. NTA", "Fully agree with the above. The behaviour is very strange and I would certainly find it deeply unsettling as well. NTA.", "Agreed - understanding that there are really, truly sick people out there - it seems like this behavior as described by OP is out of character.

God. that makes me want to puke", "The fact that OP's husband literally will not speak to her about what was said makes me think he isn't just cowed but that maybe his mother abused him when he was younger.

My friend didn't have brothers and asked if that was normal and I said it was a hell no, just bizarre.", "I threw up in my mouth a little bit", "This. Especially because it was so sudden. Brain tumors can do weird things to people.", "It's so ridiculous because he's voiced to me that she's making him uncomfortable, how she's being weird, etc but then follows it up with a \"maybe she's going senile\" and makes excuses for why she could be acting this way.", "It's honestly the most bizarre thing I've ever encountered and makes me so wildly uncomfortable. I can't even imagine how it makes my husband feel.", "I don't know, he has already told OP he is super uncomfortable with it. But he does not feel like he can say anything. If one of my relatives got \"too familiar\" with me and I was not comfortable speaking up I would want my husband to do it for me. Maybe i might be upset in that instant because it is weird and uncomfortable but I would be grateful if it stopped the behavior", "He clearly feels uncomfortable, probably embarrassed and a bit humiliated that his MOTHER is behaving like this towards him. She is sexually harassing him. Would you say \u201cgrow a spine\u201d or \u201crectify the situation\u201d to a woman who\u2019s being sexually harassed but is scared to speak up?", "I did talk to my husband about it. It's always a \"maybe she's going senile\", when she's clearly not. He has abandonment issues (his mom gave custody to his dad when he was 4 and didn't see him again until he was 17) so he refuses to speak to her about anything, even when he's clearly uncomfortable.", "It is weird, right? I tried chalking it up to my hormones for months when I first got pregnant but then other people started commenting on it as well. I did talk to my husband about it several times prior to even giving birth and I told him he needed to say something or I would because she's making me uncomfortable. He said he would but just never did. He just started saying things like \"maybe she's senile\", even though she's not.", "WTF?

I do have a say on who is and who isn't welcome in our home and around our child.", "MIL is literally sexually assaulting her son and you want OP to stay quiet?", "He's not acting mad about it. He just won't talk about it at all now. He told me several times in the past that she's making him uncomfortable, that she's being weird, etc but now he won't talk about it at all. I apologized to him for saying anything and he says \"I would really prefer to never speak about this again\", kissed my forehead and went about life like it never happened. He's not acting mad. It's just a refusal to speak about it at all.", "I agree with this, too. I've had loved ones with dementia who would wander and display overtly sexual behavior.  The combo led to them needing to be in a home.", "This is scary to know about... I wonder why this happens? I guess brain damage is a big deal.", "OP, not at all blaming you, but I really want to know why she was in L&D during your labor? Was she invited? Who told her. Nurses can and will be absolute assholes to unwanted visitors if you\u2019d like so I\u2019m just very curious to know why her weird ass was there while you\u2019re having contractions.", "I don\u2019t think you guys are at the emotional incest stage anymore. This is just incest at this point. I\u2019m not a fan of ultimatums but you should seriously consider one for your husband about cutting MIL until she gets help and getting therapy for himself.", "Yes, about 10 years ago, my aunt thought she had carpal tunnel (March) but it was a brain tumor (diagnosed June); she started saying weird things (inappropriate and confusing) which lead to her diagnosis. When she passed (before Christmas the same year), she was definitely different some of the time. I guess it has made me more suspect when people have odd changes. It also taught me to not self-diagnose as her claiming carpal tunnel may have delayed testing and we'll never know if those months would have made a difference. I think it's time for your MIL to have a full workup.", "Inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB) is actually quite common in dementia patients, doesn't mean you dont need to address it and stop it. More reason for alarm I would say, not less", "Your husband is mortified, horrified, feels shame and guilt (unfounded, he did nothing wrong) and a whole host of other conflicting emotions and doesn\u2019t know how to process his mothers behavior (have had a little experience with this unfortunately).  He needs to talk to someone, a professional.  Not for very long, usually a few sessions is enough to wrap their mind around it.  And he will need to be LC with her until SHE gets her act together.  I\u2019m not a professional so I have no idea why some women sexualize their sons but it unfortunately isn\u2019t uncommon.", "You need to be gentle with him in how you handle it though. It sounds like he feels embarrassed, humiliated and probably kind of scared about the situation and may be nervous to talk about it. I agree that therapy of some form may be good for him, but try not to get angry with him over this, it\u2019s a sensitive situation for him", "Well, the onset of dementia could absolutely explain this behavior. If he thinks that might be what's going on then he needs to do whatever is necessary to pressure her into going with him to a doctor to get fully evaluated. There are treatments that can help slow cognitive decline, but you can't take them if you're not diagnosed.", "I would still be gentle about it, try to curb your frustration towards him, bc what if she has been giving him that kind of attention and more/worse when he was growing up? His discomfort could stem from those memories and make him feel like he can\u2019t. Someone confronting her behaviour could be making him nervous bc of anything in relation to that growing up, being told to be quiet, that no one will believe him, that no one did, etc.", "Is there any chance your husband is adopted? You said they don't look alike... \n\nThe behavior is crazy and weird and, as a mom to a son, I really, really don't get it. I guess my mind wants to believe they just aren't actually bio related. Cause then maybe it could... explain it... maybe, in some weird twisted way. \n\nI guess part of me just doesn't want to believe women would behave like this to someone they pushed out of their body and raised from newborn age.", "Google sign senil and Show him. Show him emotional Inzest and then He can make his choice. But He seriously needs Therapy", "\"Well, husband, since you and I both find her behavior to be out of line, but you're uncomfortable with calling her out/correcting her while she treats you this way, then I will remove myself and baby from the situation. She can come see you, and you can go on mother/son outings (dates), and deal with her behavior on your own.\"\n\nLet him deal with it on his own, if he doesn't want to address this with her or in therapy, there's no reason for you to have to watch. Let him come to you begging for help after she crosses more lines. Then you can hand him the contact info for a good therapist.", "He probably doesn\u2019t want the gifts to stop", "Following up with \"maybe she's going senile\" isn't ridiculous or making up excuses, it's a legitimate theory. This is an incredibly common early symptom.", "You sure she\u2019s never abused him before? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\n\nHopefully you guys can go to therapy together about this bc it\u2019s fucked UP. \nBut for real don\u2019t allow her near you again\u2026", "I think I'd be having a discussion with his siblings about her behavior. Are they aware of this?", "Then OP will have to be the one to police the situation. Because the mother-in-law is behaving like a predator.", "No, but the fact that he would rather shoot his wife a look instead of agreeing with her when she\u2019s standing up for him and her is the reason why I said what I said", "Wow\u2014I think this adds a new dimension to the story that makes it even creepier.\n\nI had been started to thinking that if his usually-normal mom had started with this, it might well be a sign of emerging mental issue, possibly including some form of dementia. But if she wasn\u2019t around from early childhood until he was more or less a fully grown young man and she\u2019s acting like this? Something\u2018s really wrong and you\u2019re quite right to keep as distant as possible.", "He's most likely in denial.  Considering that story he didn't have his mother for a long time.  She's finally back in his life and being from what your story seems a \"good\" mom up until this point.  That is potentially a massive void he carried for 13 years filled.  Now all of that is being threatened once again by moms at best questionable behavior.  Something he may feel he can fix by not acknowledging it exists.  If he doesn't complain than she's not violating him, or that's how I see his potential thought process.  Desperately trying to keep what he had loss before.  \n\nFrom his behavior I think it'll be a tough egg to crack.  I'd lead into the conversation as gentle as possible even though the situation makes me uncomfortable because I'd think his actions are coming f5om a place of trauma and not maliciousness.  And even if its unfair its very hard to get through trauma with anger and accusations.  I don't necessarily think you have a responsibility to do that, but if you care about your partner enough to be there through their trauma sometimes that what it takes.\n\n This conversation needs to happen, tell him that you can give him time to put himself together for it but the conversation will need to happen and you're not going to let it go without at least talking about it openly. As a partner you do have a right to talk about the things that bother you, and his job is to at very least have that conversation and hear you out, maybe not agree but it needs to at least happen.  I always try to emphasize the conversation is about resolution and not blame or fault to try and keep my partner from feeling defensive.  \n\nHopefully this helps in some regard and I'm not just preaching to the choir.\n\nEdit: just to add I saw another comment of yours how he asks never to talk about it.  He needs to know the issue has extended past himself.  This is hurting you, and you NEED to talk about the things hurting you.", "It's super weird. Maybe now that your husband knows you mean business and will say something to her, he'll be more proactive about it so it doesn't come to that. But if not, then he's kind of left you no choice. You can't let that slide. She's sexualizing her own child and making gross and unwelcome comments about your sex life. Definitely watch her around your baby.", "Oh sorry. I read not carefully enough. Thanks for clarification.\n\noh , and it was just in the edit, so I could not know", "No one said to leave her alone in your house or around your child. You took it to the extreme.", "Your husband needs to speak to a therapist. There are obviously some issues there.\n\nYour MIL is cooked and good that you sets hard boundary.", "Yeah, no, he's behaving like a sexual abuse victim, and as someone who has been through that, I have to tell you this makes you even more NTA.\n\nAll the people who are telling you that you need to back off and let him deal with it don't understand the context here. He doesn't want to talk about it because men are conditioned not to talk about their feelings, and ESPECIALLY not to talk about confusing, messed-up shit like feeling powerless because their own mom is groping them and they don't know how to deal with that.\n\nHe can't yell at her or tell her off because he likely feels like he would be \"the aggressor\". He's a man, he has been taught never to get aggressive with women. And yet his mother is literally sexually harassing him. So he is stuck in the horrific position of being groped and harassed and basically sexually abused by his own mom as a grown man. That's bloody traumatising. And because of the way we socialise men, he feels like he just has to ignore it.\n\nBy calling it out, you are PROTECTING him. You are doing what he cannot do. Please, for the sake of your husband's mental health, keep calling her out. I think he probably needs you to.", "Ofcourse he doesn't want to speak about it, his mom wants to have sex with him, its both mortifying and traumatising. He likely wants to pretend it isnt happening. Perhaps write him a letter, not too long so it doesnt overwhelm him. Just say how completely inapropriate his mothers behaviour is, you don't want it around your child or him as its bad for everyone as well as completely disrespectful to you and tour marriage. That rules need to be set, no more MIL dropping by unnanounced, go LC for a while, as soon as MIL says something innapropriate she leaves etc.", "Yeah, it's an embarrassing thing to talk about. But he needs to get over this an address it with his mom.", ">\"I would really prefer to never speak about this again\"\n\n\"I would really prefer to never speak about this again\" lmfao, I would hit him with the \"I would prefer not to see any women groping or sexually harassing my husband ever again but here we are!\" Like your husband is seriously the AH it does not matter if it is his mom, you set a boundary and he is refusing the enforce it. This is only going to continue or get worse OP I would read texts and make sure this is not pushing your boundaries further or sneaking around seeing your child at the very least!", "Do you mean why the alcohol plays a part? It is the damage that your brain accumulates with drinking heavily and for a long time. Wet brain is the term used for the condition by itself.", "As a nurse, the highlight of my day is being sanctioned to tell someone to fuck off.

But for real don\u2019t allow her near you again\u2026", "I was gonna say the same. \nBy not confronting it, he can minimalize it. Or use rational explanations. Pretend it's not happening when she's not around and he doesn't have to face the feeling of shame, disgust, etc. Becouse it's his mother. Why would a mother behave like that. \n\nLike the excuse, it could be dementia, she can't help it. Or other excuses. \nBut the moment you say it out loud, it becomes \"real,\" and his mom is nothing more than a weird creep towards him. \n\nI really agree that a few trips with a therapist for husband might be good, to figure out how to deal with all those mixed \"I love my mom but wtf woman\" feelings.", "That's a pretty cold way of handling it I think. They are partners, they should be helping each other, not just leaving each other to deal with difficult things on their own. I think OP should at least propose the idea of therapy or putting some distance between themselves and the mother before resorting to this. If he's still resistant, then OP might not have any other choice", "I would say based on the way he reacted (disgusted, uncomfortable but no visceral negative reaction) she\u2019s acted like this toward him before.", "You really should know, because it doesn't make sense what you're defending.\n\nWhen someone makes you uneasy and makes you feel bad in your own home, there's **nothing** extreme about speaking up.\n\nDon't value yourself so little that other people can make you uneasy in your own refuge as they please.", "I had a nurse who said right up front before anybody got there \"who do YOU want in the room so that I know who to kick out because some family and friends don't have boundaries.\" Such a lifesaver. Keep up the good work.", "my favorite time in giving birth was during labor with my first. Literally watched one of the nurses go full line backer to keep my MIL from barging (like she was threatening to do) while I was delivering!!! High light of my life to date!", "I love you! Keep fighting the good fight for the mamas (and/ or dads) that need it!!! There's not much worse than being at your most vulnerable and having to deal with negative people!!", "I apologize if I misread, I did think that husband had been resistant to therapy, but ifnthats not the case, it needed to have been suggested long ago. \nAdmittedly it is cold. I don't see a reason to be warm to someone who downplays and misrepresents reality like OPs husband does. I'll coddle your feelings when you're ready to own up to them.  He clearly doesn't want a partner's help in dealing with difficult things, as he told her she was out of line when she did so. Seems fine to me to tell him, \"ok, then take her to the doctor for a dementia evaluation, if you really think that's why your mother is sexually assaulting you, if not, then take her out to lunch for a visit, but don't bring that behavior around me or our child.\"", "That's a boss right there.
