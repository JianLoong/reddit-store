Then what's the next demand? Better nip it in the bud early rather than expose yourself to a future where you are always expected to accomodate her.\n\nI feel bad for her kids.", "NTA - Of course keep things as you want them.   The only reason to change is if you want to ensure that other family members will not feel any pressure over which party to go to.   I don't like going to showers so if I were a guest I'd love this, I show up at one of them for 15 mins, the says \"gotta run\" and drive as slow as possible to the other shower..... I'd rather spend all day driving than trying not to say the word \"baby\" or getting dinged for crossing my legs....", "INFO: who actually set their baby shower date first, regardless of who is further along? IMO the priority should go to whoever chose the date first", "If you planned to have the babyshower before her then she shouldn\u2019t expect you to change the date just because it\u2019s convenient for her. It\u2019s really petty of her to try and steal this moment from you. This sounds more like a personal issue. Any other date would be fine and she probably knows this herself.

Don\u2019t change the date - NTA\n\n7th baby\u2026. Ugh\u2026 she needs to change hers or really just not have one at all. So selfish of her to even think of having a shower the same day as yours since this is your first. She should be happy for her son and want to support him and instead she is being extremely selfish. \n\nSounds like she is a real winner.", "NTA", "NTA - When it comes to these types of events (baby showers, weddings, bridal showers, etc), planning is done and dates are picked carefully. It\u2019s even common curtesy to check with immediate family and close friends if they have important events as well. As long as the date was picked first for you bridal shower and was communicated to the family, your bf\u2019s mom is definitely in the wrong.", "NTA \n\nSeven kids and one of them is only 2? WTF does she need from a baby shower that she doesn't already have? Has she met a whole bunch of new friends in the last two years who hadn't been to the last shower? Yikes.\n\nDo your thing. Celebrate with the people who actually care about you and your new baby. BFs mom is a trainwreck. You don't need to be sucked into that.", "If you change this, prepare to change everything in your life for her.  Also, make sure you and BF talk about whose kid has priority.  She's going to want an older kid to babysit and take care of her house while she works or runs around with Daddy number 8.  His focus, and yours, is on your kid, not baby sitting his future sibling.\n\nNTA to not change it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNothing you do will please or soothe her. Don\u2019t waste energy trying.\n\nCongratulations on the the new family addition.", "NTA. She sounds like a classy lady. Who the hell has a 7th baby shower.....How does your boyfriend feel about changing the date? I would not change to accommodate her when she could care less about the kids she already has!", "NTA. Your shower was scheduled first, she's making a power play.\n\nDon't give in. If you do you will always be expected to give in. Bullies only back down when people stand up to them.", "INFO - How far into the planning are you?  If you've already booked a venue and/or sent out invitations, then definitely keep your date.  If you're still in the early planning stages and nothing has been set yet, then I don't think it's worth fighting over.  In the event that there's a conflict and the family is at your baby shower instead of hers, then that's on her, not you.  She's just as capable of changing her date as you are of changing yours.", "NTA. By the sound of her, pissing her off should be the icing on the cake. Enjoy your party.", "YTA about everything except the baby shower. \n\n\u201cNone of us are supportive over this.\u201d She\u2019s pregnant. Doesn\u2019t matter if you support it. It\u2019s her body. You\u2019re not even family. She could very well shame you for being pregnant at 18 with no husband, and Reddit would be up in arms. Pregnancy shaming is never cool. \n\nAlso, maybe try to have sympathy for her stress. Pregnancy hormones and 7 kids might be a lot for a person to handle emotionally, and lead to some nasty messages to your boyfriend and you that she may not really mean. It doesn\u2019t make it right, but empathy is good.", "NTA", "NTA - but you should think about whether or not you want to start continue the drama. It sounds like you have the support of the family either way. \n\nIt sucks you have to be forced into being the mature one in the situation.", "NTA - this woman is just a wee delusional. Have your shower as planned ignore the craziness.", "NTA. She could easily change the date so that more of the family can be there. You could also both still have the same date. Baby showers only tend to be 1-2 hours, MAYBE 3. One of you could have it in the morning, and the other in the afternoon. That way, if people plan to attend both, they still can.", "NTA for every reason you stated.\n\nYou picked the date first. It's her 7th. It would be different if her youngest were 10 - but she's got a 2 year old....she should still have a LOT of baby things already. Also it sounds like this woman is going to be nasty to you no matter what.  \n\nBasically your in a lose/lose with her.  Your BF may love his Mom but hopefully he's realistic about her behavior & personality.  His main allegiance should be to You and his child.  If he wants to interact with his mother; that is his choice but that doesn't mean You need to be around her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis should be a special time in your life, with your family and your BF's family.  Unfortunately, it sounds as though your BFs mother is either very irresponsible or may have a potential mental health issue regarding pregnancy.  While I don't advocate for sterilization of anyone, I feel someone needs to discuss with her the potential for permanent family planning steps, so her vagina does not continue to be a clown car for more children she does not seem to care for.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnto the heart of the matter, you are further along, and it's your first child.  She should defer to you and you BF for the date.  Unless she advertised the date to you well in advance, you should not have to change.  That she's unwilling to change her date so that her oldest child is there for her and puts herself before the wishes of her child says a lot about her IMO.  \n\nDon't change it and I hope anyone that does attend her shower simply brings loads of diapers instead of gift cards she could use for herself instead of her newborn.", "Info: who announced the date first?", "NTA, nothing will change whether you change the date or not. Your MIL will not become a better person, or a friendlier person, nothing will ever be smooth with her. She knew your date, and yet she planned her shower on the exact date. That is just malicious intent. \n\nSean should step up and tell her to stop texting him, that this is the date you are having your baby shower and that she can do whatever she feels comfortable with. He should probably uninvite her and/or go nc with her.", "NTA, this is a power move for her and even if you change the date she\u2019ll probably come up with anything excuse why she can\u2019t be there and you have to change the date again.", "Why would her son be at a baby shower for a 7th child?
