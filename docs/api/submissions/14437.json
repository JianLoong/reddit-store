As someone with a stepfather who constantly calls his biological child his \u201cfavourite\u201d it just means i\u2019ll never rlly see him as a father and everything he does i wonder if it would be different if i was his biological child. Treat her like she\u2019s not your daughter and she won\u2019t treat you like a parent which sounds like you deserve here", "INFO\n\nYour title says you don't treat her the same. What does that look like exactly?", "YTA because a 10 year old doesn't need to hear that. You should have asked for examples and tried to fix it. If you are truly treating her differently because she's your stepchild then you need to stop, regardless of the fact that you apparently don't love her the same\n\nIn the end you said something to her she will never forget.

If not, why do you think that is?", "OK, you can likely finesse what you said to your step-daughter, but you say you don't treat the children the same.   Is this the case?  Is this why your stepdaughter accused you of not loving her as much as your bio kids?  \n\nWithout knowing the answers to these questions, it's hard to form a judgment.

This isn\u2019t something that will be forgotten on her part and might actually change the dynamic of your relationship as you have outright said that you love her less and confirmed her suspicions.

From an adult perspective, that's a fundamental difference - not necessarily something that would make you love her less, but just differently.\n\nBut she's 10 - she does not have that perspective. She's obviously been feeling something was off, that she was \"less-than\" in your eyes. She did not understand what you were saying, all she picked up was confirmation of her idea that you love your bio children more. Ouch.\n\nYou can make up for this, but it's going to take time, patience, understanding, and...well, love. Can you get some one-on-one time with her and do something she likes? Being the oldest, you might be able to take her somewhere where she could feel special and to hint that she's more grown up than the others and sometimes you might have to treat the others as \"little kids\", but that doesn't mean you love them *more.* \n\nIn any case, you do need to make an apology and acknowledge her feelings are valid, and make sure you get across the facts that she's not inferior in a way a 10 year old can understand.", "YTA kid is going to need therapy now.", "YTA. That's a really shitty thing to tell a child. No one is saying it's wrong to love your bio-children more than your stepchildren, but a good stepparent tries their best to treat them all the same.", "YTA.
