He died later and my mom has always made sideways comments that she called \"jokes\" about stuff regarding him being my stepdad and not \"real\" dad. One of my fondest memories I was talking about before is that my dad was taking me on a donut date after the birth of my second little brother, and he told me how he always dreamed of having three boys and a girl as his children (he had an adult son from a previous marriage).

Where the kids don\u2019t see each other as \u201creal siblings\u201d and step siblings? You absolutely need to foster that environment. It doesn\u2019t matter how you feel about any of them (in fact it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel the way you do - that isn\u2019t a problem at all). What does matter is that you treat all of them the same. Treat all of them like they were your biological children. Lie to the 10yo and say you love her just as much as her siblings then do something that shows that. Go out for ice cream or go ice skating or go to a dinosaur museum. I don\u2019t know what the kid likes but you should. \n\nIf you give indications that you see the kids differently, they will see each other differently and you\u2019ll really struggle to have the happy blended family you want.", "YTA! how would you have reacted if your husband did not love or treat your children equal to his bio kids???", "So a 10 year old knows the correct answer, but it failed you. Sorry but that\u2019s fucked", "Why couldn\u2019t you do the same thing that a 10 year old knows to do?", "Stolen partial comment - posted by VastAgent5931", "Much worse.", "Except this is how most real world folks think. Why do you think women literally go through years of IVF if blood doesn\u2019t matter? People literally dish out hundred of thousands so they can have their own blood. I\u2019m all for relationship over blood (but that\u2019s not how this world works) \n\nWe can claim on Reddit all day long that blood doesn\u2019t matter and that bio and step kids are the same - reality is they are not. Unless you have a stellar relationship with your step kid- if you divorce- your step is no longer related to you whatsoever, literally back to square 1 of being strangers. You can try to treat them the same, but feeling wise unless you raised your step children since they are little, they are essentially your new best friends kid. Feeling wise if we don\u2019t expect step kids to fall in love with stepparents the same way their bio parents, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect stepparents to love your children as much as you do. \n\nI\u2019m a single parent and this is precisely the reason I don\u2019t date because more likely than not- my new partner won\u2019t love my kid as much as me and I don\u2019t blame them for it. I might meet a unicorn someday but I\u2019m not holding my breath", "Cookie?", "She'll be right back here.  AITA for telling my stepdaughter she's ungrateful when she didn't want me in her wedding", "Ahhh that makes sense", "It\u2019s the opposite, it means taking a step back and letting the biological parent be the main parent and take on all the child-related responsibilities while the stepparent only helps out as they choose.", "This is a great response. Also for OP, kids are extremely manipulative and you just gave your step-daughter a ton to work with. Wait till the 12 yo hormones kick in, you\u2019ll be soooo sorry if you don\u2019t fix this.", "So lying would be preferable? What is up with this sun?", "That's the stupidest explanation possible. \nLike with enough time, the kid will \"catch up\" on love points eventually...\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s sweet and tasty and smells nice; therefore it\u2019s a cookie", "Jfc the weird, vindictive speculation you people do based on *crumbs* of information.", "Ohhh okay I was just going off what it sounded like", "She could've said the first part of what she said and then stopped talking.", "\ud83e\udd13got -4 for saying the truth.\nMost people like to attack like they are perfect and have never done any mistakes.", "I believe her words were \u201cdifferent\u201d not \u201cI don\u2019t love you as much as\u2026\u2026\u201d it\u2019s the words used in the post anyway", "Understandable. I find the stepparent sub pretty interesting for some reason so I\u2019ve learned all their terms.", "Do you honestly think \"different\" isn't hurtful as well. She gave, what may be an adult explanation, to a child.", "And how does \"nacho\" come to mean this? Be kind to a middle-aged broad and explain.", "But wouldn\u2019t OP just come off as a liar if the child still sense there\u2019s difference in the way they\u2019re loved? which I assume she did sense it since the question was brought up at all in the first place.", "Sure it comes from something like \u201cNot your child, not your responsibility.\u201d Nacho child, Nacho responsibility. So \u201cNacho\u201d for short.", "No because OP does love her. She doesn't need to address the rest. That's why \"I love you. What can I do to make your feel more loved\" is a good answer. It acknowledges her love, it acknowledges the difference and it seeks a solution.\nI am a truly blunt person to the point I suspect I'm on the spectrum. One of the hardest lessons I've had to learn is you don't get to be hurtful just because you are  telling the truth. Edited.", "Hmm. Now that I think of it that way, yeah it does seem kinda like AH behaviour. Still don\u2019t think it\u2019s strictly wrong per se, but also not the best action at that moment."]}
