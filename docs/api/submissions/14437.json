He died later and my mom has always made sideways comments that she called \"jokes\" about stuff regarding him being my stepdad and not \"real\" dad. One of my fondest memories I was talking about before is that my dad was taking me on a donut date after the birth of my second little brother, and he told me how he always dreamed of having three boys and a girl as his children (he had an adult son from a previous marriage). It always made me happy and proud that I was his girl. Well my mom had to try to ruin it and tell me that that wasn't his dream and it was just to have three boys and that I was completely wrong.

YTA.", "It's incredibly normal to not feel the same about step children; you just don't bugle it to a 10 yo.\n\nFrom the post's framework, you only have the one stepchild, came in with several children, and have recently had a child with the stepdaughter's father, so she likely is feeling the separateness acutely and you have not actually reassured her in the least. You didn't mention she was disrespectful or hostile, either, so we'll operate that this is the average 10 yo, typical ups and downs.\n\nBlended families are hard. The sentiment of claiming you view someone as truly your family is wonderful, but how often have stepparrents gotten the ice bath of being excluded from events and milestones when that child grew up? Both sides need to be open to it and as the adult, you are tasked with helping support your spouse's child. Do you need to love her like she's your own? Mm, not something that can really be forced. Do you need to do your best to be emotionally responsive to a child that is very reasonably looking for comfort? Yes and you just fumbled big time.\n\nYTA", "I mean she's on reddit so she has to like being mean to kids", "This is so key. OP, underneath this accusation was a child looking at you and asking to be loved. What a gift for your stepchild to love you that much that they would want your involvement and affection as though you were her mother. Many stepparents never get that. But where you could have said \u2018I am so sorry that I made you feel that way, let\u2019s set some time each week/month to do something special just us\u2019, you threw her request for love aside because\u2026.you haven\u2019t been with her since birth? What a terrible thing to do. YTA", "Did you have step parents? At the age of ten I knew damn well where I stood relative to my step sisters, and if my step father had said otherwise it would have felt comically inauthentic. Maybe the deeper problem is that the difference in treatment is that obvious, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so clear that saying it out loud is the problem.", "I\u2019m constantly shocked at how many people think that it\u2019s absolutely necessary to express every single thought in their heads, no matter whom it hurts.", "Seriously, OP could\u2019ve easily said she loves them all the same and left it at that", "Yikes. Agreed. OP needs to learn what age appropriate communication is. This is something you never say to any child.\n\nYTA", "I can't wait for when OP is old, wrinkly and entirely shocked that her stepdaughter too has a \"different\" love for her that doesn't involve caring or paying for her care.", "I do care for her but okay.", "I am also a step mom and my SD and SS have asked me the same thing, i said \"I love you all equally\". Because no fucking child can bear the mental burden of not being loved equally, those adult feelings and emotions that a child shouldn't be dealing with ever. Children shouldn't ever have to worry about if a parental figure love them the same or not.", "I like this because it is true, but caring. As someone who was a stepchild in two families (both parents remarried) and am now a parent, kids often feel the same way towards the biological parent and stepparent. \n\nOP can heal some damage by explaining that the love feels different but equivalent. It's the family you are borne to versus the family you choose.", "Yeah I do agree we need family therapy, it would do us the world of good.", "Hello your husband has been with your oldest since she was a baby, a little different than meeting at 10 years old.", "I don\u2019t know if it can be fixed. There are certain things that can never be unsaid, unheard.", ">I put melted cheese on top of my step kids", "If she asked you that question, she's picking up on a difference in attunement and treatment. \n\nYou just confirmed you don't love her as much and that her instinct was correct. \n\nGet into a family therapist asap to navigate this, you clearly don't understand how kids that age think, and that's okay not everyone does. But this requires someone who knows and who can navigate you both through this.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just a slightly different kind of love\u201d\n\nThe little girl didn\u2019t need to hear that part", "No parents treat their children the same.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1581811072373137408?t=WU_s2z3JQ1D86SMjVJHo_g&s=19", "Is her mom still around and involved in her life?", "I don't think you do treat her the same. If you did, she wouldn't have picked up on the fact that you love her less. Maybe do some true reflecting here because you need to do better. YTA", "This poor girl is going to remember this conversation for the rest of her life.", "Yes. We can all tell how much you cherish the child.", "the child gives the more adult answer!", "She said she met the kid 2 years ago. No matter how she felt, she should've never admitted that to a little kid. That's going to haunt that little girl forever. I can only see their relationship getting worse over time.", "It's the legitimacy of it, it's the age of the person receiving this disclosure. A 10 year old will always be hurt, whatever the situation.", "That doesn\u2019t make it okay to explain that to a 10 year old child.", "You're right, and OP should try their hardest to make  what they said  no longer true.", "Yeah my therapist calls these \u2018hot memories\u2019- the things from childhood that might seem minor to someone else but that stay in your mind into adulthood & form the basis for your fears and traumas. This girl will absolutely always remember the time her stepmother said she didn\u2019t love her as much as her real kids.", "Oh I definitely agree that they need to go in full force with damage control. But the unfortunate fact is that what she said will always remain said. The step-daughter will always remember that in times where she feels like she\u2019s being treated differently.", "Oh, this definitely became a core memory for the poor little girl. I wouldn't be surprised if she starts pulling back from OP hard and fast as she grows up."]}
