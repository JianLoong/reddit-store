He died later and my mom has always made sideways comments that she called \"jokes\" about stuff regarding him being my stepdad and not \"real\" dad. One of my fondest memories I was talking about before is that my dad was taking me on a donut date after the birth of my second little brother, and he told me how he always dreamed of having three boys and a girl as his children (he had an adult son from a previous marriage).

I strongly recommend therapy and to find out from your stepdaughter Why is she feels that way? Ask her specifically what makes her think you love her less. \nBut the reason I\u2019m saying NTA, is a child may or may not love their step parent as much as their parents.\n\nBut that love comes from a natural place, and not just because the stepparent married the parent and there\u2019s a lot of reddit posts where parents expect their kids to love their spouse and treat their spouse the same as the parent and that\u2019s inherently unhealthy.\n\nMy dad's wife did not become my mom because she married my dad. The love I feel for her has nothing to do with the fact that she married my dad. I'd love her even if they got a divorce. But I never would've loved some of the women he dated. And not only that, that some of the women's kids he dated, I never would've loved them the way I love my siblings. In fact, some of them I would not have ever wanted to see again.\n\nStep kids are no different. Children need to feel loved. But the issue with all the writers saying you were the ass hole for telling the truth, and most of them acknowledge that even if you feel that you shouldn't say it. Kids are smarter than that, and they're going to know. You can tell her till you're blue in the face you love her the same. You could've lied and she never would've heard the words out of your mouth. But internally she would've known.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself why don't you love her the same. What is stopping you from feeling the same way? If you had given birth to her would you love her the same. Would you be willing to adopt her?\n\nAnd I'm sure plenty of people will give me shit for this, but I don't care. The truth matters more. 50% of marriages end in divorce. There's a 50% chance you will divorce your husband. Having a closer bond to your biological children is not a bad thing. We were designed to have closer bonds to our children. But that doesn't mean you cannot build the bond with your stepdaughter.

I agree with most posts here you shouldn't have told her this. It's not wrong to feel but to say it to her was too harsh.\n\nI think that if you take on the parenting of a child, no matter where the child came from, you have a responsibility to do it as well as you can and to love them with everything you can. If the child has reason to think you don't that responsibility is all the greater.  \n\nNot every step parent has to do this. But if you don't take on the responsibility it needs to be clear to all parties especially the child that your role won't be that of parent. If you take it on do it fully.\n\nOf course the relationships are going to be different. But that doesn't mean you parent them differently. All of them should be getting your full attention as a parent. Making the relationship with a specific child out to be lesser is really hurtful and harmful to your relationship. They'll keep feeling like they aren't enough to make you love them if you don't make it explicitly clear they're your child now too and that puts them at the same level in the social order and in your heart as your biological kids. \n\nMaking the comparison is dividing the family in your head. My best practical advice to you is to stop comparing relationships. See the relationship as different, but not lesser", "Yta, why the hell would you tell a 10 year old (regardless of whether theyre a step child) that you don't love them as much as your other kids?", "NTA\nIf you said you loved her just the same she would have known you were lying.

That was always saved for my actual mom.\n\nThat said it did still hurt at times and I still feel angry sometimes as I feel like her and my stepsisters are now my dads \"real\" family and I'm relegated to being the outlier, and it hurts more now that my mom has died. I'm more impressed with the bravery the kid had in calling out the difference and asking the question, and more worried about why they felt compelled to do so. OP shouldn't have basically said \"your current fear is totally correct\" and I have to wonder what differences (if any) are so evident, or if it's coming from a place of greater insecurity from the child that needs to be addressed which was more my case.\n\nGentle YTA I guess.", "If a child comes to you saying they feel unloved, you don\u2019t say yeah you\u2019re right I don\u2019t love you all that much.

You build your relationship and bond. \n\nYes, that world might not exist for OP right now, but that is something she needs to work through and improve as much as possible. OP, however, doesn't appear to have gone about things in a good way.\n\nTreating this step child so differently that she noticed and had to raise it, then proceeding to have a conversation with her in a way that likely wasn't appropriate for a 10yo is going to potentially hinder her ability to form meaningful relationships too if she feels less loved, feels like an outsider and is treated differently. It could even impact the step child's children.", "It really depends on the context. As an adult kid who actually did end up having an evil stepmom, I can see OP meaning the relationship is different due to the amount of time she knew the 10 year old. It's definitely not what she SAID, but even if she said that verbatim, it's not what the girl HEARD. It really depends on how the conversation went. I think the person you're responding to is thinking along the lines of, \"hey, stepmom, your relationship is different because you haven't known step kid forever and it will take time to develop.

It\u2019s obvious and common sense that people are going to love their real biological children more than they love another kid that somebody else didn\u2019t want. For most people it\u2019s literally the last resort when you\u2019ve already done everything you can to have your own child. People would rather go through IVF, artificial insemination, surrogacy, etc. And even now are doing uterus transplants because people want to have their own real children. People can love their adopted kids to death but I\u2019ve seen countless cases of people who couldn\u2019t get pregnant adopt a kid then they later unexpectedly get pregnant and have their own child and love their biological child more. It\u2019s no different from the love between an aunt and her niece/nephew being different from the love she has for her child.
