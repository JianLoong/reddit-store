My mum and dad broke up when I was two and my dad met my step mum when I was nine. My step mum who we\u2019ll call M never really tried to get along with me and no my nine year old brain just told me that I shouldn\u2019t try and get along with her. She would ignore me and make passive aggressive comments about me and my sister coming over for weekends which eventually caused my sister to stop going, that and some mocking of my sisters anorexia. \nBack to the point, during covid times my dad convinced me to stay for a week in which me and my step mum seemed to be bonding, so much so that I didn\u2019t think twice about typing in my password when she was next to me. After that I would leave my phone to go to the toilet or grab a snack and open my phone to find my messages, Google history or social media open because she never thought that to close the apps. \n\nThis started to piss me off because I gave my trust to her and thought we were getting along. It all escalated to her looking at very private talks which included me talking about my sexuality (I hadn\u2019t come out yet) and talks about my mental struggles. It all tipped me over the edge so I decided to figure out a plan to get her to admit to what she\u2019d been doing because if I told my dad without proof he wouldn\u2019t believe me.\n\nI would leave my phone open Google with very scandalous searches such as, how to tell your stepmother that your dad is cheating, how to shoplift condoms, how to cover up tattoos with concealer, etc. but the one that caught my stepmother\u2019s attention was \u2018ab*rtion clinics near me\u2019. She sat me down the next day and screamed at me that she knew I was pregnant and called me a whore. \n\nThis caused me to yell back and when my dad got involved I admitted to everything. My stepmum cried and screamed that I tricked her and that I was an ungrateful sinner. My dad just look disappointed and told me to call my mum to pick me up. I thought I was in the right but my dads reaction has me thinking otherwise. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: thank you all for your advice and support but some of you still have questions.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I just change my password? The reason I didn\u2019t was because I was sick of her snooping, I didn\u2019t mention in my post but it wasn\u2019t her first time of snooping through my stuff for example she would go through any bags I brought with me and would look at my phone when it would light up with a message. Each time I told my dad and he would dismiss it as my imagination. I knew that if I told my dad he would just dismiss it so I knew I needed proof to finally show my dad what was happening. \n\nWhy did I try to convince my step mum that my dad was cheating? She cheated on my dad many times and still has the audacity to accuse him of cheating so I thought I would give her a taste of her medicine. It was probably morally wrong and I\u2019ve accepted that. \n\nWhy did I let her snoop for so long? I didn\u2019t want the confrontation at first because I knew that it would be dismissed by my dad so when I first started noticing what was happening I made precautions to take my phone with me everywhere which didn\u2019t stop it slowed it down and it became more frequent. I then decided to distance myself and make it so I only see my dad once a month but that still didn\u2019t stop it. The straw that broke the camels back was when texts about my sexuality were found and my stepmother tried to make more of an effort to set me up with her friends sons and would make jabs at the lgbtqia in front of me. I didn\u2019t care that she found out but I couldn\u2019t handle the constant homophobia.\n\nJust thought I would clear that up for everyone.
