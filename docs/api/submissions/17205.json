{"id": 17205, "submission_id": "13h78r7", "title": "AITA for refusing to crouch for a picture?", "selftext": "I (25F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (29M) for 10 months. I am 6'4\" (1.93 m) and he is 5'9\" (1.75 m). I've had boyfriends bothered by my height in the past but had been unaware that my current one was among those numbers until this Friday. He wanted me to come to his sisters wedding with him as a plus one which was exciting to me as I took this as a sign things were going well between us if he wanted me there. \n\nI wore flats to the wedding, I like my heels but i'm already very tall and it'd be rude to make myself even more so at the wedding and when it came time for group pictures I crouched down to make it a more even group shot, everyone tall here will know what i'm talking about we've mastered that skill. The issue however came when more pictures were taken and one of me and and my boyfriend alone was wanted, he asked me to crouch down again which took me aback a bit. I was fine doing it for a big group shot so I didn't stick out like a sore thumb but this felt more pointed. I laughed it off thinking he was joking but he wasn't and asked me again to crouch so he seemed taller than me. \n\nI got a bit upset at this and told him quietly that I wasn't going to do that and asked what his problem was. He responded that he felt it'd be embarrassing to have these really nice photo's where his girlfriend is towering over him. I was hurt at this as he's never once told me he has an issue with my height and it was a bit of a shock to find this out in this way, I excused myself from the pictures politely saying I had to use the toilets and to carry on without me. \n\nLater on after leaving the wedding he and I had an argument over my not wanting to crouch for pictures with him and he pointed out that he's seen me crouch if not outright kneel to take pictures with my friends and didn't see the difference when I told him that is because not one of my friends is over 5'4\" and it's the only way to get a picture together properly it's not about trying to make them look taller for their own ego. This led to a bigger fight and he thinks i'm not being fair or seeing things from his point of view and that it's harmless so I should just give him this and thinks i'm being dramatic when I told him I am not going to spend time making myself smaller to make him feel better as i've done that for men before and it never ends well. He has texted me a few times since then to try and tell me i'm being unreasonable and that it's not a big deal.\n\nAITA? Should I have just done it for him?\n\n\nEdit to fix a typo", "created_utc": 1684054970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h78r7/aita_for_refusing_to_crouch_for_a_picture/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OMG what ego and huge insecurities he has, I\u2019d he cares about what ppl think then he can go and date those people and leave you to find someone better who actually cares about you", "NTA\n\nDoes he care, or does he not care? Because this indicates that he cares about your height, that or what people will say to him\n\nAnd honestly, if he cares what people may say, he could just tell them to fuck right off\n\nThat'd be the appropriate reaction that he should have", "NTA. I\u2019m on the small side (5,1), so I might be biased here: people really need the get over their hang ups regarding size and gender together and what it does to their egos. Just find a pose where both look good and be done with it.\n\nLike, do you see Gwendoline Christie or Charlize Theron or Elizabeth Debiki crouching when taking photos with smaller people than them in red carpets? Maybe for a selfie, but not if it\u2019s meant to be a full body shot.", "NTA\nHe got in relationship with a tall lady. On top of it you have been together for 10 months - he had plenty of time to adjust, get used to it and find lots of positive on having a taller girlfriend. However, it seems that he hasn\u2019t and his insecurities can be weighting on him in some occasions. And that\u2019s not on you, it\u2019s on him and him only. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you as you are in all aspects, and who has sufficient level of self confidence to enjoy having a girlfriend higher then him.", " NTA your boyfriend is insecure and needs to understand that his wants shouldn\u2019t trump yours. Also how stupid would it look for all your friends and family to see those pictures knowing you\u2019re 7 inches taller? Like who\u2019s he trying to kid?", "NTA. But your bf is. It is about his ego, and I am sorry you must deal with this. There's nothing wrong with the woman being taller than the man; a mature person would understand that. You deserve someone who finds your height a non-issue because it fricking is. Honestly, I'd go as far as to say you don't need to crouch in group photos either, but I get why you did it (I am a tall woman, so sometimes its just easier that way). \n\nI also find it worrying he is doubling down on this crappy attitude and trying to gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable. Seriously, do people not understand how this is such a small/shallow thing to feel insecure about? \n\nAgain, you deserve better, you might want to reconsider if he should be in the picture long-term.", "NTA your boyfriend needs to get over his insecurity and stop trying to make it your responsibility.", "NTA. You\u2019re tall, lean into it. Wear them heels!", "NTA  \n\n\nHe wants you to make like Lady Di and sooth his ego in photographs is the thought that came to mind, and we all know how that turned out.  If this is who he is, he might not be the man for you.", "NTA.\n\nHe's showing his true ego. I'm sorry.\n\n*He's* not seeing the real perspective: You crouch in photos when needed to make the shot. Just like everyone might lean in together or form rows. It's not to hide your height or make others look taller--it's purely practical. You don't hide who you are.\n\nHe's asking you to hide. Sure, you could have some pictures with one or both of you sitting, leaning together to kiss, or something, but in a picture just standing next to each other, he's gotta be able to suck it up or he's just not going to be okay being with you. He's an AH, out of insecurity.", "NTA - you're 10 months in and he picks now to get insecure and have an issue with your height? You even wore flats to accommodate. He needs to sort his head out", ">he thinks i'm not ... seeing things from his point of view\n\nNTA Tell him you can't crouch that low.\n\nDon't let any man try to cut you down. I'm only 5'10\" but I got tired of trying not to intimidate guys because of my height. I didn't like how some of them tried to make me feel like there was something wrong with me because of it; like I was somehow less feminine. \n\nI finally said fuck it and bought a bunch of 5\" high heels. My 5'8\" husband loves when I wear them.\n\nI'm sorry your boyfriend waited so long to show you this side of himself. You deserve someone who loves your height; not someone who loves you in spite of it.", "NTA. You should have offered to pick him up.", "NTA. This is just so embarrassing - for him. Did he discover that you were tall that very day? Did he think that cameras add five pounds and make everyone look the same height? Did he assume that if he's got a picture or two of you looking shorter than him, people would forget that you're tall?\n\nIf he can't handle his statuesque gf resembling lady Dimitrescu next to him, then he shouldn't date someone taller than him. It's not that hard. Keep your head up, wear heels if you want to, and find someone who appreciates you as you are. This guy isn't it.", "NTA. Tell him that if it's not a big deal he can start wearing platforms to seem taller. If he's not willing to take the responsibility for his own insecurity then why should you?

This tells so much of his insecurities...", "NTA find a better boyfriend.", "NTA- does he think people aren\u2019t gonna realize how tall you are when they meet you?

Hopefully in the end he can learn how to be the bigger person", "NTA !!! His ego is taller than his height \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Also, you're better off without that man with fragile masculinity.", "NTA\nHe doesn't want to understand why you are willing to make yourself smaller in some situations and not others. He's only using that to attack your autonomy to consent in some circumstances, yet not consent in others. The proof is that your perfectly normal reasons didn't satisfy his \"curiousity.\" It only angered and frustrated him because his manipulation tactic failed to get you to allow him to decide when it's appropriate for you to \"make yourself smaller\" and when to refuse.", "NTA and your boyf is singing from the toxic masculinity song book.", "NTA.

People who know you as a couple will already know you're tall.", "NTA I would just say next time you'll pick him up for the picture. See if he would enjoy that. And if he's like no that's rude and  uncomfortable then you would tell him yeah now you know what it feels like to ask me to crouch. He is going out with you as you he needs to accept all of you.

There is nothing wrong with a woman being taller than her partner, but if I put myself in his shoes, wouldn't it be WAY more embarrassing to explain the photo to people??

Lol he needs to get a grip", "You\u2019re 100% right, it makes no sense at all when you put it that way", "Except they didn't and were fine with working with my height.

I\u2019m short, 5\u20192, and every man I\u2019ve been involved with has been at least as much taller than me than OP is taller than her boyfriend.  I\u2019ve taken pictures with professionals dozens of times, and the only times my partners were asked to crouch was to squeeze in for tight in close-ups or group shots.  Never for couple\u2019s shots.  Not even the guy who was 14\u201d taller than me, which is twice OP and her boyfriend\u2019s height difference.", "This is a terrible comparison.
