The issue however came when more pictures were taken and one of me and and my boyfriend alone was wanted, he asked me to crouch down again which took me aback a bit. I was fine doing it for a big group shot so I didn't stick out like a sore thumb but this felt more pointed. I laughed it off thinking he was joking but he wasn't and asked me again to crouch so he seemed taller than me. \n\nI got a bit upset at this and told him quietly that I wasn't going to do that and asked what his problem was. He responded that he felt it'd be embarrassing to have these really nice photo's where his girlfriend is towering over him. I was hurt at this as he's never once told me he has an issue with my height and it was a bit of a shock to find this out in this way, I excused myself from the pictures politely saying I had to use the toilets and to carry on without me. \n\nLater on after leaving the wedding he and I had an argument over my not wanting to crouch for pictures with him and he pointed out that he's seen me crouch if not outright kneel to take pictures with my friends and didn't see the difference when I told him that is because not one of my friends is over 5'4\" and it's the only way to get a picture together properly it's not about trying to make them look taller for their own ego. This led to a bigger fight and he thinks i'm not being fair or seeing things from his point of view and that it's harmless so I should just give him this and thinks i'm being dramatic when I told him I am not going to spend time making myself smaller to make him feel better as i've done that for men before and it never ends well.

However, it seems that he hasn\u2019t and his insecurities can be weighting on him in some occasions. And that\u2019s not on you, it\u2019s on him and him only.

You deserve someone who finds your height a non-issue because it fricking is. Honestly, I'd go as far as to say you don't need to crouch in group photos either, but I get why you did it (I am a tall woman, so sometimes its just easier that way). \n\nI also find it worrying he is doubling down on this crappy attitude and trying to gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable.

Sure, you could have some pictures with one or both of you sitting, leaning together to kiss, or something, but in a picture just standing next to each other, he's gotta be able to suck it up or he's just not going to be okay being with you. He's an AH, out of insecurity.", "NTA - you're 10 months in and he picks now to get insecure and have an issue with your height? You even wore flats to accommodate.

Why be so insecure about your own height compared to her's?", "*Major NTA*  \nIf you've ever teased him personally or brought up his height as a jab or fighting point, I can *maybe* see why he'd be upset... However, you don't seem like the person who would do this to people you care/date.

Let's be truthful, you're both a little sensitive about the height. It's not just about bf's ego, its about your ego as well. You were burned about your height by someone else close to you in the past, but your psychological self-defense mechanisms ended up leading you to take it out on your bf.

We play with camera angles a lot for fun, but making him look taller is never something he has insisted on me doing, nor anything to be upset about if we decide not to do it. \n\nThe difference between you doing it with your friends and your bf demanding it is that in one case you wanted to and in another he wanted you to, but you didn't. He needs to be ok with you wanting to look the way you do. He's not entitled to making you hide something anybody will be able to see just looking at you two. \n\nHe could have turned it into a fun opportunity to play.

There are also other ways to play for family photos. Stairs, laps, arm around, a hill, uneven terrain. All are a lot of fun. Looking taller than your bf can upset conventional standards, but there's nothing wrong with it. \n\nWhat your guy did was sad. The way you put it, it sounds like he just wanted you beneath him. Like he wanted you to submit and almost demean yourself. He didn't even try to hide it, either. That just sucks. I'm sorry, OP.\n\nETA: also, you sound stunning. I think you should wear what you like. Heels? Go for it! For what it's worth, I think you should stand up straight in pictures if you want to. Rock on! Being tall is not rude.
