The issue however came when more pictures were taken and one of me and and my boyfriend alone was wanted, he asked me to crouch down again which took me aback a bit. I was fine doing it for a big group shot so I didn't stick out like a sore thumb but this felt more pointed. I laughed it off thinking he was joking but he wasn't and asked me again to crouch so he seemed taller than me. \n\nI got a bit upset at this and told him quietly that I wasn't going to do that and asked what his problem was.

This led to a bigger fight and he thinks i'm not being fair or seeing things from his point of view and that it's harmless so I should just give him this and thinks i'm being dramatic when I told him I am not going to spend time making myself smaller to make him feel better as i've done that for men before and it never ends well.

However, it seems that he hasn\u2019t and his insecurities can be weighting on him in some occasions. And that\u2019s not on you, it\u2019s on him and him only.

It is about his ego, and I am sorry you must deal with this. There's nothing wrong with the woman being taller than the man; a mature person would understand that. You deserve someone who finds your height a non-issue because it fricking is. Honestly, I'd go as far as to say you don't need to crouch in group photos either, but I get why you did it (I am a tall woman, so sometimes its just easier that way). \n\nI also find it worrying he is doubling down on this crappy attitude and trying to gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable.

Sure, you could have some pictures with one or both of you sitting, leaning together to kiss, or something, but in a picture just standing next to each other, he's gotta be able to suck it up or he's just not going to be okay being with you. He's an AH, out of insecurity.", "NTA - you're 10 months in and he picks now to get insecure and have an issue with your height? You even wore flats to accommodate.

People can be so damn ridiculous sometimes. Next time, wear whatever kind of shoe you want and proudly stand up straight in pictures.
