About 2 months ago my sons scooter was stolen from beside our house, we have since moved everything to our sunroom and purchased cameras. Anywho... After my son realized the scooter was stolen, he figured out who had it and confronted the kid. My son doesn't not like fighting or conflict, so he handled himself very well. It came down to my sons friend taking the scooter back. After the boys had the scooter back, the boys father (thief) went to my daughters bus stop and my son called his dad/ my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 told the child's dad he was welcome to meet us at the house after work to talk. He never showed up to our house. After my fianc\u00e9 got home that afternoon, he was warning the neighbor to be careful with what they left out, we didn't want them having anything stolen. Durning this chat, the kid who stole the scooter and two other children stood across the street from our house, not knowing my fianc\u00e9 was outside, and the kid was pointing at our house and talking. My fianc\u00e9 told the kid it was his house he was pointing at and told him to ask his father to come to our house to talk about the situation. Again, nothing... Fast forward 3 weeks, my daughter, son and two of my sons friends decided we wanted to go to the park. We went to the neighborhood park and after a little while my daughter and I ran to the store. While I was leaving the store, my son called saying the same child took his scooter again. I go back to the park and speak to some of the other parents who were around- the kids mom helped the kid take the scooter again. I got information from everyone so the police could talk to the people who witnessed it. I contact the police department, this is the second time it happened, and a parent was involved, so I was pretty much over it and was done trying to handle the situation ourselves... I gave the cops all the info, I gave pictures of the scooter and all of the info that I could give. The next day, the cop calls me and says he has spoken to everyone and was about to go to the child house to speak with the family and get the scooter back. This is where I start getting really annoyed with the situation. The cop shows up and says \"kid will be kids.\" The kid tried to say the scooter was in the trash. The scooter was on the side of our house with one other scooter and 3 bicycles, it was very obvious it was not trash. Either way, he stole the scooter two times, his parents knew it was not his scooter and they helped him steal is the second time. I know it is just a scooter, trust me, it sounds kind of ridiculous. HOWEVER, WHAT PARENT HELPS THEIR CHILD TAKE SOMETHING THEY KNOW IS NOT THEIRS?! I want my children to be responsible and held accountable. I feel like this just showed my kids it's okay to be an asshole with no regard to others.

Say the mother was directly involved in the 2nd theft and you want charges. Glue an airtag to the scooter and probably your bikes to help locate them and establish proof (these can be purchasedon Amazon). In you have the means, scratch your name and phone number into the metal underneath the scooter as ownership proof as well - really, really deep. Also, consider getting a bike lock for it and show your son how to best to attach it to solid objects.", "kids will be kids, but adults need to be adults and this kids parents sound like trash.  get the cops involved, and if it continues then its time for (a) cameras, and (b) facebook/community shaming. they are thieves  and you are NTA for protecting your kids stuff from trashy people", "NTA\n\nIf cops don't do anything (insert \"pretends to be shocked\" meme here) maybe you could have your lawyer write this family a thing or two about theft.", "NTA but I feel like you already knew that.", "NTA.\n\nCop's disinterest in the theft is annoying, but the call is still useful: there is a paper record for this family being involved in theft, even if no charges were brought. \n\nMake sure you formally report every future incident with this family: if... scratch that... when this family ends up with a more serious case, likely against someone other than you, that paper trail will be relevant.", "This sub is for ambiguous situations.

They should know better.", "NTA. \n\nBut since an adult helped steal the scooter that makes them both an accessory to theft and you could look into pressing charges against the parent for stealing. \n\nI'd also talk to a lawyer and see what you can do. \n\nDont take this lying down and let it go. That just shows your kid that you give up at the first roadblock. Show your kid that people can't just take your things or do whatever they want to you without consequences. Show them you dont give up just because things get hard, or your hit a roadblock. No you find away around it. \n\nTheir is a way to solve this. You just have to talk to everyone and figure it out. \n\nIf nothing works, I'd take the super petty route and help my own kid steal it from the kid who stole it.

If you think it's worth it--This is an option too.\n\nI agree, children should not be stealing and parents should not be participating in the theft.  I would pursue it because even if the child is too young to take legal responsibility, the parent who was there is legally responsible for their actions and a charge against them will hopefully drive home the lesson that they need to teach their kids(and themselves) that they are not legally entitled to others' belongings.", "Would the airtag still work if you took the handles off and stuck it inside the bar? I feel like putting it somewhere that wasn't visible would be better.", "Cops are disinterested in doing their job period. Had to call my local police due to random people outside my home, knocking and ringing my door bell 8+ times and looking through my windows which thankfully are tinted. Normally I would have answered the door myself and told them off but when I realized there was two people I didn\u2019t have a good feeling. This went on for over 30 minutes, called the police and while they showed up and told them to leave. I never heard from the cops, have no clue what they wanted & no report was made.   I believe they were apart of a group of people going around stealing packages and breaking into cars.", "I think it is more the cop getting into my head. I wish I had a recording of the whole conversation. He acted like kids are kids and the family did nothing. They refused to let me file a report to press charges. He acted like I was being an asshole about the whole thing. I am a pretty logical person, but nothing about this is logical in any way.", "Th cop returned the scooter last night, so we did get it back.", "If the scooter is made of metal then putting it inside of the bar will either block the transmissions entirely or at least severely limit the range (to many variables to know which without testing).", "I don\u2019t think an air tag can work as they are easily removed or lost. but I think getting the scooter engraved with a name and number could help. In order to remove it they would have to file it off which would leave obvious marks.", "Thennits time to talk to an lawyer, because a cop can't just refuse to let you file charges. \n\nI'd go ahead and try again with the police, and then talk to a lawyer.

It\u2019s possible that the value is too low to be considered criminal/able to press charges.", "I hadn't thought about that.
