All the family likes his fianc\u00e9, we really accepted her as part of the family already even though they have only been dating for two years. \n\nThey got engaged four months ago. She was extremely excited and nervous about the dress in particular, she is like the kind of silly girl who loves weddings and that kinda stuff so we expected it tbh. She asked some friends and close family to go with her to buy the dress. \n\nWe went to the store and she let us each pick a dress we wanted her to try. Most of my family picked big dresses, mainly because she's too thin and we think a tight dress will make her look bad. Everyone in my family is kinda a big size, except my brother who got into fitness at a young age and a cousin who had anorexia and it was so bad she passed away for causes related to it. We have always been worried about FSIL's health although she says she's just skinny and she's healthy. \n\nWell, she was trying on the dresses and one of her friends had picked a strapless siren cut dress. It was cute, but it looked bad on her, it made her look like she was sick and unhealthy. I told her I didn't liked it, it didn't suit her personality. My family agreed with me, but her friends and family said she looks gorgeous with it. She changed into the next dress and so on. She hasn't buy a dress yet because she wants to think about the options and which one she liked best. \n\nMe and her went out to eat yesterday as I'm in charge of her wedding cake (I own a bakery) and we needed to talk about that. We also chatted about other stuff, at some point she asked me why I was so against some of the dresses she tried on the other day. I told her I just think she looks better with a big dress, it makes her look like a princess. \n\nShe told me she's thinking on buying a siren cut dress and asked me why does that kind of dresses don't make her look like a princess. I then told her that quite honestly, they make her look too thin, like she's sick. She rolled her eyes and asked if it makes her look anorexic. Which I said \"yeah, kind of, you look like (cousin's name) in her prom dress\"\n\nThen she went off on me, she told me I was awful and then left. She then told my brother what happened and he called me to tell me off too. AITA here? She asked me and I answered honestly.", "created_utc": 1681311282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jopq7/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_she_looks/", "score": 514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's wrong. There is a way to be honest. You could have said and phrased it differently. Honesty doesn't have to make the other person feel like bad but should paint your perspective clearly. She went off on you because of the way you said she looked in A DRESS SHE LOVED AND WANTED TO WEAR.", "YTA There are way more tactful ways to say that you prefer the princess dress.

There a ton of details here that this isn't an isolated occurrence where you honestly answered her question about how she looked. Your family has been hounding her about her appearance for a while, so much so that she always \"says she's just skinny.\" The fact that she asked why you're \"so against\" her dress choices implies you didn't just say you preferred other dresses, but instead were overly critical of the ones she liked.

Leave the poor woman alone.", "Info: that's not the first time you told her she looks too thin, is it?\n\nYTA \n\nWhat would you do, if you constantly got called anorexic, even though you aren't? And this is HER wedding. She doesn't need to look how any of you want her to look. The only thing that matter is that she feels gorgeous in that dress and that it's comfy. The only thing you achieved by telling her that she looks sick, is that she now feels insecure. Congrats.

And throwing in the cousin was too much too.\n\nShe had a dress she loved.  Then you had to be an AH about it.  The most important thing for her is to have a dress she loves even if it's not perfect to you or others.  This is one of those times when honesty is not the best policy, especially if you are going to throw such nasty comments in there too.  The dress should be about what SHE wants and how she feels in it.", "YTA - You sound super judgmental and jealous by how you describe everything \"she is like the kind of silly girl who loves weddings and that kinda stuff \" and \"mainly because she's too thin and we think a tight dress will make her look bad\", it's her day there is a better way to say you like the princess dress rather than she looks sick and anorexic. \n\nIts about her wedding, keep your projected insecurities to yourself and find a dress that she feels the best in for her day. You can choose a big dress for your wedding, until then try to be respectful and apologize.", "YTA, you weren't baited, you knew she liked the dress and instead of being supportive you criticized her appearance in it, and when confronted, you still doubled down. You know what's really easy to say, \"it's great you found a dress you like.\"\n\nAnd also,  \"...even though they have only been dating for two years.\" Why the judgment on how long they've been together?\n\n\"...makes her look like a princess.\" Not everybody wants to look like princess!", "YTA\n\nThere are so many inoffensive ways you could have said that that you almost deserve a prize for finding an absolutely wrong one.", "YTA\n\n>she is like the kind of silly girl who loves weddings\n\nand I knew you were going to be the asshole as soon as I read this, wth", "YTA you were rude and obnoxious. \u201cI don\u2019t like that one, it doesn\u2019t feel to me like it suits your personality, but what matters is whether you love it\u201d is as far as you needed to go in expressing your opinion.", "YTA describing someone as having an eating disorder is so cruel i wouldn't ne surprised if you weren't welcome to the wedding", "YTA.

I hope you feel terrible about this.I\u2019m glad your brother is supporting and defending her from your vile comments.", "YTA. \n\nDon't comment on people's bodies, end of story. She didn't ask about her body, she asked about dresses. \n\nAll you had to say was \"oh I always liked the big poufy dresses\" and when she told you she wanted X dress, you say \"oh that was very pretty too.\" It isn't your body, your dress, or your day and it has zero impact on your life. \n\nI am a big person, and it is very irksome when I see people think it is okay to call people skinny/too thin, because I would never want someone to comment on my body. \n\nJust like plenty of my friends have picked out styles I don't care for personally and I just say \"you seem really happy in that, it's beautiful\" you could do the same.", "Info: what the fuck is wrong with you?", "YTA - First just the way your post reads shows that you have a weird obsession with what her body looks like.\n\nSince she asked your opinion, I guess you could tell her what you thought but adding the \u201clike she\u2019s sick\u201d line puts you in the middle of AH territory.\n\nETA judgement.", "YTA\n\nYou come off as an overweight person who shames thin people.  And also very judgy about liking weddings.  You obviously don't much like your FSIL.\n\nYou didn't mention issues with her diet or how she never eats anything.  Or that she otherwise looks ill.  It very much just sounds like \"she is thin and thats ugly, so I said so\".  And it sounds like your family has harped on her about her weight before.\n\nYou need to apologize and back off.\n\nI say that as a overweight person who finds thin body types unattractive.", "How are you nearly 30 and thought to yourself, \u2018yeah, this seems like an appropriate thing to say\u2019. Like, seriously? Your post also comes off as you and your family being jealous and insecure about your own size. Don\u2019t project those insecurities into others.\n\nYTA", "So, because you are jealous you body shamed her. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou put her down in multiple ways. First of all, it\u2019s not silly to love weddings. Just because you\u2019re not interested in it doesn\u2019t make it silly. Many people love weddings. In fact, your bakery probably gets a lot of business from them, which I doubt you find silly. \n\nSecondarily, you basically chastise her for being skinny. Fat shaming isn\u2019t ok, and neither is skinny shaming. To be frank, you sound kind of jealous that she can wear a snug dress and feel good in it, so you might want to do some introspection there. \n\nThird, telling her she looked anorexic was terrible. That\u2019s how people develop eating disorders, by people telling you your body isn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d size. If you actually care about her, you\u2019ll apologize for that gross comment.", "YTA\n\nYea, she asked you if the dress made her look anerexic but you already had the pre judgement that she already had when she tried on the dresses you personally didn't like. \n\nWhat you're actually saying to her is that you rather her fat like your family and not be healthy.", "YTA, and I'm betting a bunch of your comments stem from jealousy.  You sound rude, petty, and just plain mean.  I'm waiting for the \"AITA for telling my pregnant SIL she's gaining too much weight?\".", "YTA Op if you hate how you look do something about it but don't take it out on your brothers fiance.", "YTA. Why would you compare her to an anorexic person?", "YTA\n\nskinny shaming is bad like fat shaming so dont do it.", "YTA. I don't even need to read the post. Disgusting to call anyone that. If she were fat, would you call her obese? No different than doing that and EDs are a real thing and shit like this sends people into a tailspin.", "YTA.

No one can be this clueless, surely?", "YTA - I would venture a guess that your future sis-in-law is probably normal weight and looks great in the dress. And that you won't look as big by comparison if she had a \"big dress\" that your family picked.  The comment \"making her look anorexic\" was just added cruelty.", "INFO: did she look like a younger Keira Knightley in terms of how thin she is (think of the green dress in Atonement) Or skinnier than that?\n\nCause some people are just naturally thin and everyone thinks it\u2019s a health issue when it\u2019s just how they are. \n\nBut based on what I read, I think it was rude to say she looks anorexic.

That's wrong and you know it.\n\nYTA", "YTA and your jealousy of your brother's fiance reeks so bad we can all smell it. Plus there are so many things you said that made not an ounce of sense.

Yes YTA - in what reality would you not be after even reading this title. Didn\u2019t your parents teach you \u201cIf you have nothing nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d. Now this poor woman is going to feel awful whenever she thinks about this dress.", "YTA. Calling her a silly girl is the first insult. You're judging her negatively because she's excited about the most important day of her life? I can't work out if you're jealous she's found the love of her life to get excited about and marry and you haven't yet, or if you're married to someone you don't feel as excited about. Either way, calling her silly for being excited about her wedding shows us that you're a negative person. Calling her a girl is also deragatory given she's a full grown woman getting married and doing grown up things.\n\nNow your issues with her body. As other commenters have said, you seem jealous of her as you seem intent on shaming her for not being big. I can't really say what your issues are exactly and why you are projecting them onto her, but you come across as jealous and mean.\n\nIt's also ironic that you're calling her Anorexic whilst having a meeting over the wedding cake. Anorexia is a severe illness and I can assure you, she wouldn't be that into the cake aspect at all if she was Anorexic. It's a pity she's giving you the business for this cake too. She's included you in her wedding and you just seem to be doing your best to offend her.\n\nFurthermore, if she was Anorexic and as thin as you say, she'd have likely struggled to find a dress that would even fit her. Having been Anorexic myself, there is a certain point where clothes shopping is impossible and I find it unlikely she would have requested an audience to see her try on stuff if she was Anorexic. Sounds to me she is just very slim and you can't handle it because you're not and so you have resorted to nasty name calling.\n\nIf she was Anorexic I doubt she'd have been happy with how she looked in anything she tried on. I'm glad she found a dress she loved herself in. I'm sad you were rude about it to her.\n\nPersonally I'd say you need to apologise and do some internal reflection on why you feel negative to her having joy over her wedding and being a smaller size than you.", "I love when people say, \u201cShe asked so I answered honestly\u201d \u2026 as a way to justify their jealous inappropriate behavior.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone that worked in a wedding dress store, there\u2019s good ways to give honest feedback and bad ways. I assume by \u201csiren\u201d cut you mean mermaid? Because siren isn\u2019t a thing. They suit some skinny women but not all. You really need a good waist to hip ratio to really look great in that dress\u2026and if you had pointed out that you found the dress didn\u2019t really work in her hip area because it was too much of a straight line, you\u2019d be fine.But it\u2019s never okay to tell someone they look anorexic, unless it\u2019s a situation where you\u2019re staging an intervention. Never ever okay. Constructive criticism is pointing out actual problems\u2026this is just jealous and bitter and judgmental.\n\nIf you actually want to help her, a trumpet dress may work well.

She asked some friends and close family to go with her to buy the dress. \n\nWe went to the store and she let us each pick a dress we wanted her to try. Most of my family picked big dresses, mainly because she's too thin and we think a tight dress will make her look bad. Everyone in my family is kinda a big size, except my brother who got into fitness at a young age and a cousin who had anorexia and it was so bad she passed away for causes related to it. We have always been worried about FSIL's health although she says she's just skinny and she's healthy. \n\nWell, she was trying on the dresses and one of her friends had picked a strapless siren cut dress. It was cute, but it looked bad on her, it made her look like she was sick and unhealthy. I told her I didn't liked it, it didn't suit her personality. My family agreed with me, but her friends and family said she looks gorgeous with it. She changed into the next dress and so on. She hasn't buy a dress yet because she wants to think about the options and which one she liked best. \n\nMe and her went out to eat yesterday as I'm in charge of her wedding cake (I own a bakery) and we needed to talk about that. We also chatted about other stuff, at some point she asked me why I was so against some of the dresses she tried on the other day. I told her I just think she looks better with a big dress, it makes her look like a princess. \n\nShe told me she's thinking on buying a siren cut dress and asked me why does that kind of dresses don't make her look like a princess. I then told her that quite honestly, they make her look too thin, like she's sick. She rolled her eyes and asked if it makes her look anorexic. Which I said \"yeah, kind of, you look like (cousin's name) in her prom dress\"\n\nThen she went off on me, she told me I was awful and then left. She then told my brother what happened and he called me to tell me off too. AITA here? She asked me and I answered honestly.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Especially when they say \"we carry up to a 24!\" but a 24 is actually a real 20 or smaller.", "She likely did try on several sizes based on what was available.", "Because calling someone, especially an adult, \"silly\" is usually an insult. Especially when used to describe something they are passionate or excited about. \n\nAnd who decides she's too excited about her wedding dress? What's the limit?", "It's that you called her a silly girl. She's a woman who is excited about her wedding.", "We don\u2019t, but you clearly intended it as an insult with the context you used it.", "You could\u2019ve used so many words instead of \u201csilly.\u201d You could her bubbly, animated, excited, expressive \u2014 please don\u2019t play like silly was meant in a positive way lol\n\nPeople aren\u2019t idiots and we don\u2019t like our intelligence being insulted.", "we had a really nice attendant who warned us about the sizing. \"The number on the dresses run higher than what youre used to, dont freak out. youre not actually that size. formal wear is different than your every day purchases.\""]}
