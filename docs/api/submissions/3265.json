The checks are so small that you'll rarely break even unless you have extant resources. In my case, it was five bio kids, two foster kids, and two bedrooms to share. The rooms weren't big enough. \n\nAbuse by foster and oldest bio brothers ignored by parents only curtailed when a bio girl\u2019s teacher visited to inspect her living conditions. Both foster kids were removed, much to the dismay of the parents who wanted to keep the foster girl instead of the bio girl, but the state doesn't allow that. \n\nWhen everything is shoved together in tiny spaces, it's easier to miss that one kid doesn't have blankets, three are sharing a cot because they're afraid of the oldest boys, some do not all have actual beds, one has only one pair of shoes, the boys have more room, etc. \n\nIt wasn't a basement for us but a large closet under the stairs (pre harry potter) and an unfinished (exposed nails) attic smaller than your bathroom, which was then deemed okay to put a bio kid in. The state would act if a foster kid were living in a closet, but bio kids are harder for protective services to intervene on behalf of. The older the kid, the less likely the state will care but not all of them have ventilation or windows (fire hazard and illegal to put a foster kid in). \n\nTL;DR People are creative and skirt the foster care rules as much as possible until you make the requirements so strict they seem ridiculous.", "Semi-finished basement needs two fire exits.

I totally understand you doing to, you are justifiably angry and upset. \n\nBut consider thinking about how what you are saying can hurt others, because you said it as if there's no way an adopted child could be your sibling. And logical or not, an adopted person might read that and think \"yup, that's how people see us, when they're being truly honest\".

If, for instance, they'd spent your college money on IVF instead and tried to kick you out of your room, I think you'd still not view that child as your sibling, because the reasoning is not actually about shared DNA.\n\nHope you take this in the spirit intended, I know you're in a very shitty situation and am sorry you've had to deal with this, you're very much NTA.", "Not legally.", "Ty I knew there must be a word for it", "Wtf is iykyk", "Some houses only have partial basments with the rest being crawl space.
