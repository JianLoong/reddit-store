Sounds like this might have been the straw that broke the camels back for your grandfather, sounds like your fatherhas been taking advantage of him for years.   And honestly your father and his wife chose to bring a baby into a home where there was no space, they need to find somewhere to live with room.", "Your father, a grown man with a growing family is living in his father\u2019s house rent-free, is expecting you to move out while you attend college in the same city you\u2019re currently in and pay the rent he doesn\u2019t ?

It must be more than, \"they want to give my room to the baby\"", "NTA \n\nNot sure why so many people are calling you the AH and acting like an entitled kid. It isn't about being told to move rooms, it is about knowing you would have to get rid of some things and the lack of consideration for you\n\nAnd to everyone telling you to move out and get your own job and quit complaining, would they say that to their own 18 year old.  \n\nI don't see going to grandpa as tattle tailing.  Your dad and step mom clearly are not thinking about what is best for everyone in the family, so you went to the only person who has shown themselves to be an advocate for you", "INFO I'm guessing this is your grandfather from your mom's side, and your dad's wife isn't your mom?

I was initially sympathetic to you but then I saw your comments and you come across as very immature and unpleasant. I know you're very young, but try to be a nicer person.", "Your dad and his wife are assholes not you", "NTA  it was your grandpa choice  not yours. Question: Is grandpa your dads father or your moms father?", "If this is a real situation then y\u2019all need counselling and ESH", "YTA. Talk about whining to grandpa when things don\u2019t go your way. Your dad might become homeless because you didn\u2019t want to lose some of your things? Grow tf up. You\u2019re an adult. I sincerely hope that he cuts your ungrateful ass off.", "YTA, the fact they are doing something as amazing as giving a child without anything, a home and a family yet you call it their problem and throw a tantrum because you got moved out of your room. \n Wow. \nSo you have a bit less space in the basement, big deal. Do you know how many people would kill to be able to live with lower rent?? Nevermind rent free? And you take it for granted. \nI have no words to describe the size of asshole you are. You will also quickly realise that living alone is not always as fun as you think.\n\nEdit  after further details have come out ESH", "Big YTA. You're an adult and should be glad you get to live somewhere rent-free at all. What other option was there, put the baby in the basement? Grow up.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like there is more to the story and your dad has a bit of a history of mooching off your grandfather.  He's living there rent free which means he's in a very lucky position.\n\nThis is a tiny house.  It's 2 bedrooms.  Surely with all the money that your dad has been saving he would be able to afford a 3 bedroom home to accommodate all of you.  And when you move out, your bedroom can become the spare room or a study.\n\nSpeaking of studying... if you're at college... where does your dad think you will do your study if he wants your desk gone because there is no room in the basement.\n\nAlso after you told your grandfather the story, your grandfather could've just told you that you could live with them seeing as that's what you plan to do anyway and left your dad where he is..  it may be your step mom or your grand dad is a hard arse too.", "Esh and YTA. Spoiled child. You don\u2019t even live there you just spend time there.", "I don't think it was about my dad. My grandpa HATES my stepmom.

No she is my stepmom. It's average", "Not because moved to basement. Because parents said OP to throw away all things and furniture besides the bed and closet. This basement so tiny that practically uninhabitable. Yes this is a BIG deal. \nYes, adoption amazing thing to do. But expect to kick OP from the house they don't owe was stupid and selfish idea. And expecting to move OP to the basically underground closet too. OP didn't choose to adopt so don't have to give out all life and belongings for that. \nSo absolutely NTA.", "Sounds like dad is also living there rent free.\n\nNTA", "Not adopt the baby? Go find their own home? Put the baby in their own room?\n\nIt's their problem not mine", "How come he hates your step mum out of curiosity?", "He was *told* to move to *the basement*.

Electricity, gas, internet, groceries, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly feel like you overreacted, you still had a room, but ultimately it is your granddad's decision even if it seems foolhardy to me to trust the property to a teenager.", "Jesus, you ARE entitled.\n\n\"Daddy gave my bedroom to the baby, gwampa!!\" \n\nOh boo hoo, get a real problem. It's the basement, you're not homeless.", "Nta your grandpa is looking out for you.  I am glad. Just because kids start college doesn't mean they don't need support.  Also a quite place to study. Your parents should have made a better plan with tge adoption.  I am surprised the adoption agency didn't ask them about this.", "YTA.\n\nYou made the situation horrible for everyone.  \n\nAre you moving with them?\nWhat if the new bedroom is too small for your desk?\n\nYou created something that could be a long-lasting rift in the family.", "Average as in a 3 bedroom house with a basement? Or is it a 2 bedroom and yours was the only available room? \n\nWere you interviewed as part of the adoption process?\n\nIt's nuts that your grandpa would kick out his own son, but he's showing him about as much courtesy as your dad was showing you.", "Ok I somehow missed the part about throwing away everything my apologies. It's not in the original post. \n\nIf that is the case then yes I agree. ESH. Serious lack of communication and understanding between family members. Kicking them out is a bit severe though.", "Why don't YOU find your own home? You threw a fit like a toddler and ran to your grandfather to tattle. You're acting like a child.", "She was really rude when she started dating my dad and grandpa hates disrespect more than anything. One thing I learned when I was very young was to never say anything rude to him or in front of him", "Yes, bc a 1 year old that OP is obviously jealous of, should be in the basement by itself. OP all of a sudden isn't getting all the attention so acted like a 5 year old little brat and went crying to grandpa.", "The basement is a room, regardless your reasoning for NTA was based on OP paying rent which is false. OP even admitted they wouldn't be able to afford the bills on their own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently, OP is going to move in with his grandad anyway so he got his dad and 1-year-old sibling kicked out for nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy final opinion is, grandad is NTA because he can let whoever he wants to live in the property live there but OP is the ashole because he went nuclear because of jealousy.", "I'm not actually planning to live there. I'll probably live with my grandparents so I won't have any of this expenses. He took the home from them because he is mad at my dad and doesn't like his wife", "No but they are", "Yeah my grandpa is awesome. If it was up to my dad he'd kick me out after he got married", "They started it. You sow what you reap", "Well, OP not really good person too and it's all definitely lack of communication. But he not kicked them. He just told his grandpa what happening because don't have another way to defend himself.\nGrandpa kicked them.", "I'm not the one who got kicked out. I don't need to find a home", "They could move in the basement and give their bedroom to him. If it's good enough for me, it's good enough for them. The only reason my grandpa gave them that home was because of me anyway. They wanted to rent a 1 bedroom home and make me sleep on the couch. Grandpa offered to let them live there rent free so I could get my own room\n\nThey should have thought about it more before giving me the basement", "The only thing OP did is tell his grandfather what was happening, i don't see where OP went nuclear? Or am i missing something?", "This statement makes you TA.  If you had no intentions of living there, you could have just moved in with grandfather.   If he wanted them out then it is his decision.", "You got your dad and a newborn kicked out and you don\u2019t even plan on living there?!? You don\u2019t think that\u2019s a dick move?!?", "Yeah. Congrats. You just made a literal BABY homeless. I hope you feel really really great about yourself.", "I pity your sad existence. Enjoy your life in solitude, you lonely little boy.", "Reap what you sow*\n\nNot a native speaker my bad", "Oh lord. They wouldn't have gotten kicked out if it weren't for your childish hissy fit. I feel bad for your new sibling that you have this little care for them. Good luck managing a household on your own.", "It really doesn't, he couldn't of known his grandfather was going to kick them out because of it. All OP has done her is tell his grandfather whats going on in his life.", "What is next do you want me to give my car to my stepmom because I take the bus to college and don't use my car? Just because I don't want to live there anymore it doesn't change the fact that they basically kicked me out of a home that doesn't even belong to them", "I wasn't planning to get them kicked out I was just talling to my grandpa. I didn't know he is gonna kick them out", "They should find a home then. The baby shouldn't stay homeless.\n\nIt's their baby not mine. I'm not responsible for providing him a home", "I am kinda enjoying it actually and why would I be alone? I'm not even planning to live here anymore my grandparents want me to live with them", "Why can't the 1yo stay in their room??\nDoesn't a college student need more room than an infant especially when you can't even fit in a desk in the basement lol.\nYour judgement is seriously misguided.", "that baby is your sibling though", "Your grandparents won't live forever kiddo. Life is gonna F you hard faster than you know it, and daddy is rightfully gonna tell you where to go.", "Is your dad staying at the property then?", "I could care less to be honest. You chose to make your father homeless purely out of jealousy over a baby, even though you're acting like one. Funny, right? \n\nEnjoy living with grandpa dearest. Hopefully he enjoys your shoddy company more than your father does.", "Do we share DNA? No\n\nWere we raised together? No\n\nDo I even like the baby? No\n\nTherefore not my sibling", "Hopefully they will live a very very long life and just fyi I'm getting almost everything. Grandpa really doesn't want stepmom to get anything you see?", "I don't understand what you mean. He is staying there now but has to leave in a month", "It seems like you care because you are still here talking to me\n\nI will enjoy it thanks", "IT is your fathers son, makes it your sibling.  The baby does nto have your fathers DNA yet is still his child.  You seem to have a lot of hate for a baby. Also how could you not like a baby?", "You are a true asshole from what I see in your comments. A little bit of critique or adversity and you straight to your protective shell instead of learning and growing.", "If you are moving in with your grandad, is the property now just going to sit empty?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt feels like a bunch of nonsense has happened because you were unhappy about being asked to downsize your room for your sibling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI smell jealousy.", "It's easy have you seen any babies? They cry all day and can't even do anything useful. It's not even a cute baby", "He is probably gonna put it for rent or something?\n\nHe is not my sibling"]}
