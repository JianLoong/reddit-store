We don't know what he could afford. He prioritized having a second child after his son was an adult. That's not a crime, and his time was limited.\n\nIn the end, adult OP has a place to live, a house and an inheritance, and his college paid for while the dad and his wife and child are homeless, but will likely move into the original planned apartment or something similar, and are at least free from Grandpa's control. Win/win for everyone.", "someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning god damn\u2026 do you know them personally? bc you\u2019re making an awful lot of bizarre assumptions\u2026", ">Doesn't sound like the best kind of person to live with now, does it?\n\nThis might shock you but it's not hard to show someone respect.\n\n\n> Grandpa didn't do this out of love for his grandson, \n\n\nThe entire reason he gave them the house was for OP's benefit.\n\n>he used it as an excuse and took joy in making his own son and family homeless *because he felt disrespected by his DIL*.\n\nCrazy idea, don't disrespect someone who's giving you free housing.\n\n>OP has already shown that he's not the type of person to sacrifice an ounce of his comfort for family. \n\nBeyond the fact that OP's parent took their college fund for the adoption, it's not anyone else's job to sacrifice when you decide to have kids. Especially when that sacrifice is something you could do yourself lmao.", "Dad used his college fund for the adoption.", "And it's impossible for you to imagine that OP might think that Grandpa deserves it?  Grandpa, being the only family member in the story who doesn't treat OP like absolute crapola?  Sure thing.  I'm glad you're such a virtuous and self-sacrificing individual that you can get up on suuuuuuuuuuch a high horse and look down on the rest of us plebs.", "You should move her to basement to make room then.", "that would be fucking hilarious", "wasn\u2019t arguing anything, just stating my opinion", "Not that hard to not like a baby, I\u2019m 30f and *gasp* I don\u2019t want kids and hate babies!", "A little bit of critique my ass. The person just told OP \"life is gonna F you hard\" this isn't a critique. Some people are butthurt that they don't have such grandparents."]}
