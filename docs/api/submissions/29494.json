My family went to her state for a wedding which is when this whole thing blew up. At the wedding her parents were bragging to everyone that she\u2019s in the top 10 of her class. This didn\u2019t bother me until they started asking the cousins who are high school age what their rank is. I was very annoyed at this because I\u2019m in the middle of my class but I go to one of the top high school in my state. It\u2019s so good that it\u2019s well known that the top 10 usually go to Ivy League schools. \n\nAnyway, I tried to ignore them but eventually her father came to our table to talk to my parents. Of course he brought up her top 10 standings then turned to me and asked mine. I answered I didn\u2019t know which made him laugh and told me that he bet it\u2019s not top 25% or else I would know. I was about to say something but my mom pinched my thigh hard to where I had to look at her. The entire thing put me in a bad mood for the rest of the night. When we got back to our hotel, I spent the night looking up her high school and found a bunch of articles about how bad her school district is. I found an article that stated fewer than 10 students in her entire school were proficient at math. I laughed hard, save those articles, then went to sleep.\n\nThe next day at family dinner, almost everyone was there when her parents started up with it again. I pulled up some example SAT math questions and challenged her to complete them. \n\nThe short of it is she didn\u2019t get any right, her parents yelled at my parents, my parents yelled at me, and dinner was ruined. She later texted in our cousins group chat that I\u2019m an ass for putting her on the spot and I replied that it\u2019s easy being in the top 10 when everyone else is an idiot.\n\nWe\u2019re home now and my parents want me to smooth things over by apologizing to the rest of the family and specifically to my cousin for putting her on the spot. I don\u2019t want to but dad told me that grandpa is going to ban us from the Christmas gathering unless I do. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to.", "created_utc": 1698061697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eig83/aita_for_pulling_out_math_problems_to_prove_my/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, it seems that the way you chose to handle it might not have been the most productive. Let's break it down.  \nYour cousin's parents were bragging about her academic achievements, which can understandably be irritating, especially when asked about your own ranking. However, pulling out math problems to challenge her in front of everyone might have been a bit confrontational. It's important to remember that academic rankings and intelligence are not solely determined by math problem-solving.  \nYour comment in the family group chat about everyone else being \"idiots\" could have come across as disrespectful and hurtful, and that's likely why your parents are urging you to apologize.  \nWhile it's okay to have felt frustrated, it's generally better to address such issues with more understanding and empathy, especially when it comes to family gatherings. Apologizing and explaining your feelings in a more considerate manner might be a way to resolve the situation and maintain family relationships.", "YTA.

But of all the crappy people here, you are the least. Of course your cousin's parents are number one for trying to humiliate others (it sounds like you weren't the only one put on the spot). Your parents get some blame because they allowed your uncle to harass you without any intervention, not once (the wedding), but twice (the family dinner). Your grandfather for expecting you to apologize to everyone when ignoring the behavior of your cousin's parents which started this whole thing - at a wedding when the focus should be on the bride and groom, and family good times, not one-upmanship on high school class ranking.", "It must be a very small high school to have \u201cfewer than 10 students in her entire school to be proficient at math\u201d.", "ESH, except your cousin. It was her parent's bragging, not her. Her parent's suck for bringing you into it, they could have just been proud of their daughter without comparing her to anyone.

You suck for embarassing your cousin for what her parents did. \n\nYou suck the least out of the three since you were only defending yourself, but the way you did it wasn't good.
