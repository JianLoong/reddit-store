This didn\u2019t bother me until they started asking the cousins who are high school age what their rank is. I was very annoyed at this because I\u2019m in the middle of my class but I go to one of the top high school in my state.

Of course he brought up her top 10 standings then turned to me and asked mine. I answered I didn\u2019t know which made him laugh and told me that he bet it\u2019s not top 25% or else I would know. I was about to say something but my mom pinched my thigh hard to where I had to look at her. The entire thing put me in a bad mood for the rest of the night. When we got back to our hotel, I spent the night looking up her high school and found a bunch of articles about how bad her school district is. I found an article that stated fewer than 10 students in her entire school were proficient at math. I laughed hard, save those articles, then went to sleep.\n\nThe next day at family dinner, almost everyone was there when her parents started up with it again. I pulled up some example SAT math questions and challenged her to complete them. \n\nThe short of it is she didn\u2019t get any right, her parents yelled at my parents, my parents yelled at me, and dinner was ruined. She later texted in our cousins group chat that I\u2019m an ass for putting her on the spot and I replied that it\u2019s easy being in the top 10 when everyone else is an idiot.\n\nWe\u2019re home now and my parents want me to smooth things over by apologizing to the rest of the family and specifically to my cousin for putting her on the spot.

However, it seems that the way you chose to handle it might not have been the most productive. Let's break it down.  \nYour cousin's parents were bragging about her academic achievements, which can understandably be irritating, especially when asked about your own ranking. However, pulling out math problems to challenge her in front of everyone might have been a bit confrontational. It's important to remember that academic rankings and intelligence are not solely determined by math problem-solving.  \nYour comment in the family group chat about everyone else being \"idiots\" could have come across as disrespectful and hurtful, and that's likely why your parents are urging you to apologize.  \nWhile it's okay to have felt frustrated, it's generally better to address such issues with more understanding and empathy, especially when it comes to family gatherings. Apologizing and explaining your feelings in a more considerate manner might be a way to resolve the situation and maintain family relationships.", "YTA.
