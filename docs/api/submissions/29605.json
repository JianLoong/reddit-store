If OP wants to treat the two differently that is her prerogative but it is definitely a weird way to go about it even with a preexisting relationship with the niece. Second nephew/niece is coming whether they like it or not and being willing to offer money only for one of the children is odd. Mathematically it does not make sense either. If the mom contributes X amount to the niece and OP contributes X amount then when the baby comes the niece will still see a reduction if OP does not up their contribution. This is because the new baby requires resources as well, which the mom will have to solely contribute now. So as an example, before new baby niece was getting x amount of resources from mom and 2x from OP. When the new baby arrives, mom will have to use all available resources to care for the baby meaning that instead of the 3x she was receiving from mom and op prior to new baby, she will be receiving something less than that as mom allocates x amount of her resources to the baby. \n\nSo regardless, niece will be losing resources due to the new baby, even if moms contribution is minimal.

I do not think that\u2019s reasonable and would be just as cruel. \n\nBut not handing money over to their sister or doing free childcare seems like an understandable choice unless it\u2019s causing direct harm (in which case I expect that necessary care for the kids would end up being a more serious larger family discussion based on info given here).", "[deleted]", "Yeah, this is tough.

Yeah sure, **because of their mother** who can't afford them and makes sure that the only other person responsible can't actually BE responsible.

How entitled.", "It's not OP's responsablity to make the two feel equal, also, it is unlikely that the discussions and money that reach the parents have to reach the children's ears and understanding. But ultimately, the mother should be able to at least support one of her children if she couldn't with the first one and needed her sister to half adopt her first child.", "Your comment literally says that.", "It did not sound that way to me.

That you went above and beyond for her when was a teenage single Mum because it was an unideal situation due to an unwise decision. Now she's an adult woman with life experience who chose the same scenario to expand her family. That's not the same situation. Knowing what it's like to be a single Mum to 1 kid with an unknown father, if she feels capable of being a single Mum to 2 kids from the same situation, then she's old enough this time round to do that on her own. With her own finances. \n\nBut it's ungrateful to be 24, planning to expand her family under the expectation her sister and her sister's husband will financially support her family forever. You're not her kids parents. This isn't your role or responsibility. And you're not going to keep pausing your life to support her having more kids. Because you know if you do it with her 2nd kid, then in 5 years time she'll get pregnant again the same way expecting the same support.\n\nA difficult conversation. But I think you need to literally spell it out for your sister that she's not 19 anymore, she's making a choice as an adult woman now.

What is done for older girl should be done for new baby and that includes loving the baby and treating this child as special and a gift too, just as they did the older sister.\n\nCertainly OP should encourage her sister to go after the fathers of her children.

I had a friend who wanted to keep it, but she wanted to abort, so she had an abortion (which is fine). If a guy begs a woman to get an abortion and she doesn't, he gets no say beyond that. In the age of abortion the final choice/burden of that choice is on women. It makes sense, because it's their body, but if it ends up being a bad decision (Father is broke, not interested, she has no money or career) she still ultimately decided to make that decision.\n\nNow if we are talking sex/contraceptives, obviously it takes two to tango. Men have no opting out after conception and are typically ordered to play child support whether they want the child or not. I'm not saying men have no responsibility at all, but I tell guys that is they don't want their future decided by someone, don't have sex with them, especially without a condom/other BC.\n\nThe majority of situations like this I have witnessed, woman gets pregnant with a random dude, decides to keep it because \"she wants a baby\", the guy pays child support, and the parents help her raise the kid. If she doesn't have those resources or the guy disappears, she well likely become a burden to the state and live in poverty.
