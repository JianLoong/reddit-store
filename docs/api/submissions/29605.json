If OP wants to treat the two differently that is her prerogative but it is definitely a weird way to go about it even with a preexisting relationship with the niece. Second nephew/niece is coming whether they like it or not and being willing to offer money only for one of the children is odd. Mathematically it does not make sense either. If the mom contributes X amount to the niece and OP contributes X amount then when the baby comes the niece will still see a reduction if OP does not up their contribution. This is because the new baby requires resources as well, which the mom will have to solely contribute now. So as an example, before new baby niece was getting x amount of resources from mom and 2x from OP. When the new baby arrives, mom will have to use all available resources to care for the baby meaning that instead of the 3x she was receiving from mom and op prior to new baby, she will be receiving something less than that as mom allocates x amount of her resources to the baby. \n\nSo regardless, niece will be losing resources due to the new baby, even if moms contribution is minimal. The only question really is whether OP wants her sister and newest niece/nephew to dislike her for her choice.", "If OP suddenly withholds LOVE from the older kid (or the new one when it\u2019s born) because their mom makes decisions that they don\u2019t like, they\u2019re so far into the AH field I don\u2019t know what to say. I do not think that\u2019s reasonable and would be just as cruel. \n\nBut not handing money over to their sister or doing free childcare seems like an understandable choice unless it\u2019s causing direct harm (in which case I expect that necessary care for the kids would end up being a more serious larger family discussion based on info given here).", "[deleted]", "Yeah, this is tough. I feel for your new niece/nephew, but you arent wrong for setting boundaries. She cant just keep having kids and expecting you to pay for them.\n\nI would do everything I can to try and make your new niece/nephew feel like a part of the family, though. By the time he's old enough to notice that you only babysit your niece, she'll be a teenager and wont need it any more...So he won't exactly have anything to be jealous of. Poor kid will probably resent his mom, though.", "If I was in your position I wouldn\u2019t give anymore than you are now.

Yeah sure, **because of their mother** who can't afford them and makes sure that the only other person responsible can't actually BE responsible. Apart from that, I don't even know how to explain to you that a sister is not obligated to provide eternal financial support to her nieces and nephews. How entitled.", "It's not OP's responsablity to make the two feel equal, also, it is unlikely that the discussions and money that reach the parents have to reach the children's ears and understanding. But ultimately, the mother should be able to at least support one of her children if she couldn't with the first one and needed her sister to half adopt her first child.", "Your comment literally says that.", "It did not sound that way to me.
