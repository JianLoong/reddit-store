Im sorry to say.", "YTA for:\n\n1. Acting entitled to other people's free childcare services. It's ok to ask politely, it's not ok to insist and to mutter insults when refused.\n2. Not being able to go without alcohol for the time it takes to stand in line for a ride at an amusement park. \"But the line was very long\" is not an excuse. If you're an alcoholic, get help, but don't endanger your child to get your fix.\n3. Being willing to leave your 4 year-old child with complete strangers, or all on his own. For any reason, much less getting some effing beer. \"But I could see him from the beer stand\" is not an excuse.

You're immature for not accepting the judgement you've been given and a neglectful and irresponsible parent. You left your toddler with people YOU DONT KNOW.
