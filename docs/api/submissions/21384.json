There\u2019s just no understanding sometimes on Reddit especially what it\u2019s actually like to be out with small children. Like what was she going to do? Put the baby on the floor? And while I understand stranger danger the chances that someone in line is actually going to run off with your baby are so incredibly small\u2026a little empathy and community spirit would go a long way. They say it takes a village but I feel like the comments here are all \u201cI hate that you procreated please keep it to yourself\u201d", "I still remember my dad leaving me (3) and my 4 year old brother alone in his truck to go get beer. It really laid the groundwork that beer was important and we were not.", "I\u2019ve been asked by strangers to watch their kid at parks and soccer games when they have to run their other kid to bathroom or get something from the car. It\u2019s not a big deal, especially when our kids are playing together. What makes OP an AH in my view isn\u2019t the ask, but the way they reacted to the answer no, and then leaving their kid to get a beer anyways.", "Right? Morals don't include watching a stranger's child in a non-emergency situation. Morals and common courtesy DO include NOT asking complete strangers, who could possibly be a danger to your child, to be in charge of the welfare of your child because you want a  beer. \n\nI'm actually not a proponent of stranger danger, but carnivals and theme parks are easy locations to pick up small children and lose the parent in the crowd.", "The OP is AH.\n\nBut it's a strench to say a 4y old will make that deduction.", "I don't think a 4 year old is gonna make that correlation", "Hahaha cares more about beer than her jfc yall are dramatic", "And you really do have to be super mindful about that. Like I don't know the layout of the venue they were at, but a kid is way more likely to zoom off and drown in a pond or a river than be snatched up by a stranger by magnitudes", "But muh beer......you don't understand.... there was beer.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be any better even if OP was getting food instead of beer. You do not leave your child. Period.", "That said they didn\u2019t want to watch some strangers kid", "Nah fr the amount of videos I\u2019ve seen where babies and toddlers get SNATCHED from strollers and shopping carts. No way! I\u2019m keeping my baby strapped to me!!!!", "I have to agree. Someone would be have to be stupid to book it after being handed a baby in public. As soon as they make to take off, m everyone that saw the baby, including the parent, was handed to them would possibly say something, call the police, or even stop them once they started taking off.", "This. OP, YTA.", "Not at 4, but she might thinking back when she\u2019s older.", "She will figure it out later, if beer remains the priority. I remember friends whose dad's wouldn't come to a Girl Scout family picnic because there wouldn't be beer there. They knew better than to ask. How sad is that?", "Nope. She wouldn\u2019t have cared less. Unless she was a particularly anxious child who didn\u2019t like to be separated from parents, in which case I\u2019d hope dad wouldn\u2019t have thought to ask. Both my kids were confident and had secure attachments and wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye. Especially if they could see me the whole time.", "When you get gas you're not abandoning your kid with strangers while you fuel up. To boot, strangers that said no to watching your kid that you left with them anyway.", "It wouldn\u2019t be emotional neglect, it would be categorized as neglectful supervision. He created a risk to the child\u2019s physical safety through non supervision to go get beer. Happens to lots of parents every day when they make similar choices unfortunately", "Neglect is categorized in different ways and this would be considered neglectful supervision, it\u2019s real and people do get into trouble with protective agencies over it often. And usually it centers around getting their substance of choice. I\u2019m not saying anything about the parents drinking habits but in my experience there is usually a substance at the center of pictures like this.", "Even if they were great parents a 4 year old can get in trouble in a new york minute. They don't know the kid, what if she refuses to listen. Unless I know the child well, no way I am taking that responsibility.", "Most adults who are so desperate for a beer that they abandon their 4 year old in line aren't stopping at one beer.  That type of need is alcoholism and I doubt this loser stopped at one", "nahh, kids run on laughs, short attentions, and dreams", "People would do that to me! Just park their stroller at my register and give me a look, and before i could say anything they were off and I was a babysitter lol", "Since it mentions this is a 4th of July celebration, this is in the USA. As a citizen of the USA, I can tell you we are kind of insane about our unspoken rules of waiting in lines. Trying to step back in could result in anything from simple refusal to actual deadly assault (unfortunately, I'm not exaggerating at all). If you step out of line and no one is \"holding your spot\", you absolutely have to go to the back...unless the person behind where you were is like saint level kind.\n\nI'm a person who believes in the basic goodness of others. And I've been burned by that plenty, but it doesn't stop me believing. However, when it's a line, all that belief goes out the window. I've seen many that would physically push that little girl aside in order to move up a spot in a long line. No way I'd ask them to watch my preschooler for any reason!", "Yeah, my bad; no one in my family has a car and I'm used to taking public transit literally everywhere, even to out of town festivals; but \"out of town\" in the US is a whole other beast I imagine. \n\nAnd I know the type you mean. Where I'm from I was mocked for being so strict with the car seat in Ubers, and I've seen more than one person having kids that should be in car seats or boosters sitting in the passenger's seat with no seatbelt. Boggles the mind.", "Or offer to treat the other parents to a beer or two if one of them, since there were two of them, would grab it.\n\nI have done similar before when it was hot out and was in a long line. Also it wasn't beer, it was non alcoholic refreshments.I was alone with my, at the time, 6 year old (kids are grown adults now). There was a group of 3 adults and one kid behind me. I asked if one of the adults would physically get the six of us drinks I'd be happy to pay for all of them.They agreed.", "it really depends on whether his God given ability to make an accurate judgment based on the surroundings, his abilities, the kids abilities, and time frame. Its insane to legally grant a father his rights but then argue against his best judgment. Firstly he probably doesn't give a dam what people think to begin with, unless its a learning experience. Like could he have done something differently or was his decision acceptable or not.", "The poster put /s which means \"sarcasm\" just fyi", "I got that it was America. But that seems literally insane. Australia hates queue jumpers with a passion,  but someone stepping out of line for a second to deal with a child or get a drink, wouldn't even be looked at twice when they rejoined in the same spot. It would be a courtesy to ask the person behind them if they could watch their spot. \n\n\ud83d\ude2a that's just sad.", "As a former early child education professional, THANK YOU for your diligence about keeping those kiddos safe.  \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "That wouldn\u2019t be the type of neglect in question. This particular instance would be a case of neglectful supervision. Most cases come in over a instance of neglectful supervision and then the other problems come through investigation. It\u2019s a pretty big red flag unfortunately", "Sure seems like it. If a person doesn't act exactly as you think they should regarding a child, social services should be the first thing you do - according to this sub.", "I guess they should also consider NA, and Serial Killers Anonymous and anything else they can think of, too.\n\nThere's no reason whatsoever to even suggest AA here.", "No mention of drugs or serial killers was made. OP mentioned they left their 4 year old child unattended to get a beer, hence the mention of maybe an underlying alcohol dependency issue."]}
