He was the smartest kid in the majority of classes he was in at school. It\u2019s not uncommon for kids to do this who are not socialized with kids who are also very smart. When my kid got into classes with other smart kids his age, it helped a lot with social skills. What doesn\u2019t help is dad whining because he feels inferior to his kid and has decided unilaterally that he\u2019s going to teach his kid a lesson. Face it, she\u2019s smarter then you and probably always will be. This doesn\u2019t work for you, probably because your ego doesn\u2019t allow for it.

She\u2019s not bullying anyone by being right, or telling someone else that\u2019s she\u2019s right.  If your hearing that other people don\u2019t like her behavior then you need to sit down with her mom and figure out if this is an actual issue or if your daughter is just blunt.

You demonstrated the wrong behavior here and subsequently put yourself at a big disadvantage in this teaching moment. Unfortunately YTA for that, but thankfully this can be fixed!\n\nInstead of \"stooping to her level\" of meanness by poking fun at someone's ignorance (example here is one's knowledge of cinema), I'd try starting off by plainly explaining what she's doing and how that makes you feel.\n\nYou could then generalize this to other moments and situations in her life (with friends, family, classmates, teachers, coaches, etc) and tell her how her actions and words can harm her relationships and end up negatively impacting her.\n\nWhile very smart she is still nine years old and needs gentle guidance when it comes to understanding compassion and empathy. Those parts of the brain are still developing, she's going to mess up. Please understand she will continue to make mistakes like this for many more years to come. Don't repeat or escalate the negative behavior in an effort to \"throw it back in her face\" to have her \"see how it feels\". You may only end up encouraging or worsening it. You have to approach it from the opposite direction by modeling appropriate behavior from the start.\n\nFull disclosure I haven't had enough tea yet. Did that make sense?", "YTA. To yourself as much as anyone else. You clearly have some unresolved issues with your ex, but let's set that aside. Instead of parenting your child, you stooped to getting into what essentially amounts to a pissing match with a nine year old. Take a minute to think about that. In that endeavor, you then reinforced a bad behavior. You were frustrated with her, so you asked questions intentionally designed to make her feel stupid. Then you got mad when she did exactly the same thing to you. You taught her, in that moment, that the correct way to handle that situation was to embarrass the other person and try to make them feel stupid to show that you're better. And she responded by doing exactly what you'd just showed her. That's the behavior you chose to model for your child, so you don't really have much room to be mad at her for following your bad example.", "Yup, no doubt, YTA.\n\nSo something your 9 year old daughter said irritated you so much you had to resort into acting like an 8 year old to try to win an argument with your daughter.\n\nHow does that make sense?

You are doing the right thing.", "NTA. She is young so it's somewhat normal, but this behavior only gets worse. You need to make sure it doesn't continue otherwise she will end up very cocky and will have problems with many people. She should definitely feel smart, but she shouldn't be bringing everyone else down in the process. That's what you need to make her understand", "YTA. This is why children shouldn\u2019t have children.", "I need to know. What was the math question she dropped on you?\n\nEdit to add: NTA, of course", "I was once in grade 3. We were learning long division and the teacher had 8\\2 written on the board. I was sitting up front and I remember this clearly, I just muttered 4 under my breath she heard it. She then proceeded to berate me about how I was trying to act to smart and I should be able to do 17*13 just as easily. I was always a confident kid and I have always been (till now) decent at math. But hers was the only class in which I scored bad marks in math as a subject. I couldn\u2019t finish the papers for her class either. I just shut down and that was really unlike me. \n\nYour daughter is a child- her world view is extremely limited at this point in time- don\u2019t shut her down, don\u2019t discourage her in the way that you did.

I loathe people who act like they know everything, so I totally get it. On the other hand she is only 9 and most children act this way at one point or another in their lives.

Correct **yourself** first.", "NTA. I have these types of conversations with my students of similar ages all of the time. Unfortunately though, it doesn\u2019t matter if YTA or not.

You tried to show your daughter what it would feel like to teach her to have empathy and instead she tried to one up you on a different subject.

Be careful with that chisel.", "yta\nshe is 9. \nshe is NOT her mother \nyou need to see her for the kid and person she is, not try and take her down because you think she is like her mom and has \"quite the ego\". \nYou as the adult can work to have conversations where you manage not to take offence at how she speaks. \n\nbecause you decided she was putting you down instead of learning, more about what she likes, and having a great, talk and sharing ideas - you chose to teach this nine-year-old a lesson but I think you may not realize that the lesson taught her os  that you are not someone who is a supporter where is interested in what she has to say and only and how you feel she's saying it.  She's going to find a lot of that out in the real world.  A lot of people are gonna go out of their way to stomp on her when they think she has quite the ego - her dad shouldn't be one of those people", "ESH.

Some workplace would hire the 2nd or 3rd best if the 1st choice has attitude problem (egoistic, putting other people down). I gaurantee her ego will inflate in nano-second once (and if) she enter college and real life. Many people are smart in different ways and no one can be perfect in everything.

She wants to act like the smartest one in the room IGNORE IT. \n\nDon't feed the beast.  \n\nYta for the approach.", "Mostly NTA Dude I've been there, your daughter is testing out being a bully for sure, but she's 9. She's trying to build her confidence and she's learned a short cut from her mom. Build yourself up by putting others down. Not great. But you are looking at it in an AH way. You don't teach a 9 yo modesty or try to take her down a peg with your adult knowledge. You want her to learn she doesn't know everything when you should want her to learn that it's okay not to know everything. Easier said than done. Your attitude is askew, but I don't blame you. Teasing you for not knowing something she thinks should be common knowledge can be annoying (my teen does it too but she is easier to reason with). Unfortunately with kids sometimes we have to not react immediately and give them a lot more slack than they deserve, while balancing that with teaching them to be better people. Don't come from a place of checking her ego, you want her to have a lot of confidence (especially since she's about to enter the preteen years where confidence drops significantly). You just also don't want her to be a jerk. \"Are you trying to make me feel bad?\" Or \"are you making fun of me?\" said calmly sometimes works for me. But you know parenting is hard and our kids will inevitably have something to talk about in therapy no matter how hard we try to get the balance right.", "Honestly NTA in my opinion. I can see the point that its \"making her feel bad\" and as people have said, acting like a 9 year old yourself but I don't think that's really it. Definitely you need to teach her that it's rude and upsets people to act like she knows everything better than them but also it goes beyond that. I actually think naming movies that you know and she doesn't is exactly the right move - it's not about \"getting her back\" but actually *showing* her, not just telling her, that different people have different knowledge and skills. It's really important imo, to teach her that she **isn't** better than other people for knowing stuff they don't, not just teaching her that it's rude to say it. \n\nMaybe it would have been best to try and contextualise the movie naming thing a bit more, rather than just ploughing ahead but on the whole I don't think this was wrong.", "You\u2019ve ho a long road ahead. I hope you read this thread carefully and realign yourself. YTA.", "NTA sounds like your daughter is going to be (if not already) an absolute creature  and a mega bully in school. She needs to learn some humility.", "NTA\n\nI used to be like your daughter, and then got a reality check when my dad told me i wasnt shit. Your daughter will from time to time need a reality check; knowing some thing matters little to achieving things. Perhaps you should redirect her ego to making her achieving things in life.", "Well put thank you. I admit I perhaps could have skipped the first part about the movies, this is my first child so I\u2019m still learning as I go lol", "Adults should know better than to tell anyone under the age of 14 that they've got an ego problem when actually the parent is always the one projecting their lack of healthy ego at that point.", "Thank you for the comment, I will be replying while the comment list is still small in case this gets a lot of responses. \nCan you explain how me showing her how it makes people feel when she puts others down, is not being an adult? I did not yell or talk down to her, I simply showed her how she makes others feel. Can I ask how you would have handled the situation?", "It\u2019s not about one upping her. You are not around her so you don\u2019t know how she behaves. She does this to put other people down, I\u2019ve commented before, I\u2019ve received complaints multiple times about her putting other people down, aka bullying.

She\u2019s a bully because of how smart she is and feels. Have received multiple complaints about it. It\u2019s not just her being a smart girl. It\u2019s her being a smart person and forcing everyone around her to know just how much smarter she is than them. So you\u2019re going to sit there and say if I had a son then it would be him in the wrong? Give me a break it\u2019s wrong either way whether she\u2019s a girl or a guy stop grasping at straws", "This seems far reaching to me. If my son was acting like this I\u2019d be irritated, too!", "No it means teaching her that she shouldn\u2019t be putting other people down. She does this to everyone around her including classmates, family, me and her mother. It doesn\u2019t matter who, her ego takes over and she lets everyone know. And she does not back down from it. So those words are correct in describing it.\nI\u2019m very proud of her and love her to pieces.

The only YTA that actually makes sense here..", "You misunderstand, it\u2019s not being competitive. It\u2019s showing her that she in fact does NOT know everything.

I\u2019m not sure how you got that I\u2019m competing with her out of that. But thanks for your input", "Care to explain? You guys seem to want me to let her actually make other people feel bad about themselves because she has an unchecked ego. I have received complaints from her friends parents, and her teachers. I experience it from her as well. I just don\u2019t understand how explaining to her that she does not know everything and shouldn\u2019t put others down for not knowing what she does, is somehow wrong?", "Hahaha please keep in mind I struggled through school being in and out most of my life.

Therefore, you need to behave appropriately.", "I think the problem is that you tried to show her bullying is wrong, by bullying her. We know that doesn't work. It actually helps make more bullies. I always say, \"like begets like.\" If you bully her, even if it's in an attempt to try to show her how she's acting, you're just going to get more bullying. Show her how to be nice and respectful by acting that way yourself, even when correcting her. \n\nThere are some good kids books on good vs bad teasing and I especially love \"how full is your bucket: for kids.\" Even if it's things she knows, this gives you a good shared language to use to talk about these things. It's also a lot better to develop empathy by using characters. Like, if your friend Abby said that to you how would you feel. Or if that doesn't go well, back it up further to movie characters. Take a minute to pause a movie and talk about what's going on and what the characters may be thinking or feeling or what may be motivating them. \n\nI strongly advise you to do a little research on \"former gifted child syndrome.\" It's not an actual syndrome or diagnosis, but it is a real impact many adults now face after being identified as gifted children. There are so many pitfalls for these kids because their academic abilities far outstrip their social-emotional abilities because one part of them is so much more advanced than the rest of them. Don't get me wrong, this isn't some poor little smart kid thing, just something parents need to be aware of. I've seen it happen with kids who are gifted in athletics or music or art too.

She will be more hurt by Dad doing something mean than vice versa.

If you did what you said in this reply in the way you said it, you'd be fine, but that's not what you're describing in your post. You did put your daughter down and make her feel stupid. She had been doing the same to you, but as an adult and her parent you are both more capable of and more responsible for regulating your outward response. You're not TA for the lesson.
