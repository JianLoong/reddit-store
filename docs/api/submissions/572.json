{"id": 572, "submission_id": "ygkwbb", "title": "AITA For \u201cSnapping\u201d At My Coworker\u2019s Child?", "selftext": "I [20F] started my current job about a month ago. Yesterday, I came in and spent all day in the back preparing inventory, and only came out front to relieve my coworker Nina [35F] for her lunch break. When I showed up, she was on a phone call with her son [9M] and ended up clocking out and leaving to go pick him up. She brought him back around 30 minutes before close and stayed up at the register with him and our other coworker Alice [22F]. I continued my tasks in the back room, until yet another coworker appeared, Tom [24M], who told me that someone who bought a recliner came in to pick it up, 15 minutes before close. This stressed me out a bit, but it was worse when I ended up in the other back room and realized I was going to have to move this thing by myself,. I\u2019m not terribly weak, and the lady who was picking up the furniture was following me step for step and trying to make conversation while I, a relatively petite woman, was trying to move a 60+ lbs recliner up two different ramps. \n\nI managed to get it up the first one, then stopped to readjust the chair on the roller. While I was stopped, Nina\u2019s son jumped into the chair. This is where I guess I upset her. I said \u201chey buddy, can you get out of there?\u201d just as Nina came up and told him sternly to get out of the chair. He got out, but continued to try and play with it until she pulled him back. I started rolling it up the ramp, having to stop halfway because I felt the chair slipping off the roller, and Nina\u2019s son appeared again at the bottom of the ramp, trying to help push the chair. I was becoming more stressed and anxious, and very scared that this kid was going to be seriously hurt. I tried to ask him to back up and stop touching the chair, and Nina looked up and called him back over. Tom, who was watching from the register with Alice, asked if I needed any help and I said \u201cI just need someone to keep the kid away from the chair.\u201d\n\nI finished getting the chair to the back and Tom came out to help me load it, and that was that. This morning, I showed up to work thinking things were gonna be pretty standard, but ended up being pulled aside by my manager [36F] before I could even clock in. She brought in Nina and the assistant manager and said we needed to talk about how I \u201cspoke to Nina\u2019s child yesterday\u201d and how I apparently snapped at him. I didn\u2019t get written up or anything, (probably because we have a rule in place prohibiting employees from bringing their children to the store, especially into employee only areas) but the issue wasn\u2019t really talked out or resolved, I was just chastised and talked over any time I tried to explain myself. It was a real emotional reverse from how good I\u2019d woken up today. Nina isn\u2019t speaking to me, my manager is pretty neutral, but everything feels very tense now and I\u2019m just counting down the hours until Nina leaves early. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong, but am I the asshole here?\n\nEDIT - Thank you to everyone for your responses/feedback/insight. To those of you telling me to go to HR or Corporate: I don\u2019t think that would do much good aside from putting me in bad standing with my coworkers and manager. My manager has been here over 10 years and allegedly does other sketchy stuff and still hasn\u2019t been let go, and I don\u2019t wanna poke that bear. I\u2019ll be leaving this job anyway at Christmas because I have some personal things going on just after the holidays and will be unavailable for work for a week, and I know as a new employee I won\u2019t be approved for that much time off. I\u2019m just gonna keep my head down and finish the next eight weeks of work and start putting in apps to new places in early December.", "created_utc": 1667053257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygkwbb/aita_for_snapping_at_my_coworkers_child/", "score": 1106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because nobody came with me, I assumed they were busy with other tasks because were busy yesterday and somewhat short staffed. After Nina left unexpectedly in the middle of the day we were down to four staff members. It turns out everyone was just at the register talking to Nina and playing with the puppies she brought in.\n\nAlso, in the moment, the child\u2019s safety was more important than mine or my issues with the chair, which is why I asked for someone to keep him away before asking for help.

She clocked out to go get him and didn\u2019t really have to return (usually she doesn\u2019t anyway, regardless of if she has someone to watch him) and she only came back to pick up a nonessential item she\u2019d forgotten when she left in a rush. \n\nI completely understand situations where you have to bring your kid to work.

Now that a few hours have passed, I would suggest requesting a conversation with your manager in private. And saying that you would like for him to now listen to your side of things. And then tell him exactly what you told us. Because you were stressed, there may have been a little more emphasis in your words then you might have intended. However, given the situation your feelings and your actions were completely justified. And, tell him the next time your coworkers bring their children into work and allow them into dangerous situations rather than risk snapping at a child you will simply cease working no matter what a customer may want.

Or employees like to stop in to visit (why, IDK \u2014 I have a life outside of work TYVM). So basically this Nina chick clocked out, got her child and some puppies, and came back to work. And instead of supervising her child, she allowed the child to treat the store as a playground. \n\nYeah, OP. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re looking for greener pastures. You do not need to deal with this circus.", "I was obviously joking. Just pointing out how ridiculous the coworker is. OP was CLEARLY looking out for the child's safety (as well as her own) and instead of appreciating OP looking out for her kid and getting her kid TF outta there, she complained. What did the mom honestly expect her to do in that situation?", "My manager isn\u2019t interested in hearing anymore about the issue and I don\u2019t have any kind of leverage to be making those kinds of statements, honestly. I don\u2019t want to make things more tense, honestly.

You didn\u2019t even let me speak???", "I understand, but I thought I could take care of it because I\u2019d gotten both recliners down there with no problem. And like I said, I thought my coworkers **couldn\u2019t** help me. I also had the customer who bought this chair following me every step and trying to talk to me, so I couldn\u2019t think straight, and I couldn\u2019t walk away from her to go find my other coworkers. It was all just a mess. The next time I have to move furniture like this I\u2019m gonna ask someone before I go get it. The other thing is that this is the only time we\u2019ve stored furniture in the lower back room, because we had more furniture inventory delivered a few days ago than we expected. It was just everything bad that could happen ended up happening.", "Yeah that sucked. It was maybe 10 minutes tops but I hated that", "Then I am sorry for you! If you can, maybe search for a better position with a different company. It sounds to me as though you are not in the best of working situations. If you are not in a position where you can search for a different job, then I highly recommend that you do something special to give yourself a treat of some kind to take your mind off of your stresses.\n\nPlease enjoy a cyber hug from an internet stranger!", "NTA, keep your head down and get through the next 8 weeks.  When it's time for an exit interview, if that happy, this would be a good thing to tell HR", "Also never let any manager pull you aside for company business before you clock in.  That's work business, you get paid for it, period.", "Can you go over their head?", "If this is a corporate store please go to corporate HR. Both Nina and your manager were very wrong and this is a huge issue tbh. She brought a kid and endangered the kid and you by her not monitoring him closely enough and also brought puppies into the store? No way is corporate ok with this and you could be seen as complicit when they find out if you don't say something. Also that discussion will be put down as a generic verbal warning against you and it needs to be removed entirely.", "NTA - so now keeping a rug rat from being run over by a 60 lb recliner and possibly badly injured is \"parenting\".  Good to know.  And your AH of a manager is very lucky you didn't end up getting hurt and filing a WC claim, further impacting his staffing issues for much longer than a day.  Frankly I don't give a rat's patootie about Nina or her child care issues.  She shouldn't bring her spawn and puppies (seriously!?!) into the workplace to cause disruption and distraction.  You had a really crappy day, you have total brass-plated AHs for a manager and coworkers--I'm so sorry.", "See if there\u2019s a whistleblower hotline or corporate HR phone number you can call.  This is definitely worth reporting", "Yeah... No. This is unacceptable. Nina shouldn\u2019t have been in the store with her child or puppies. \n\nHER job is to parent first. She wasn\u2019t. Her child could have been hurt while you were trying to wrangle a piece of furniture. He could have slipped out the door. And honestly? I would have been PISSED if I were the costumer and some kid decided to play on the chair I just bought. \n\nYou need to speak to your manage alone and explain what happened without being talked over. \n\nNTA", "You have been left to do all the work. And you have not stood up for yourself. Please get some training in assertiveness. NTA for speaking to the child. (From how you tell it you  did not snap at him)  The mother was in the wrong on several counts and the manager is negligent and dumb.. Everyone else here is an asshole. And unless you begin learning to assert yourself you are too. Good luck. I hope you get a break soon.", "You were left in a position you shouldn\u2019t be in bc your coworker wasn\u2019t supposed to be bringing in her kids and pets.  You did the right thing.", "It really does sound like nothing was in the wrong here. Just a lot of small, overlapping unfortunate things can made it not ideal. I hope Nina doesn\u2019t hold onto it at all (because she shouldn\u2019t either).", "Thank you \u263a\ufe0f \n\nI will be putting in applications in early December since I\u2019ll be quitting this one just after Christmas", "My manager was also talking over me. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s interested in my side. When she was ready for the conversation to be over like five minutes after it started, she said \u201clet\u2019s put this behind us now and not fuss about it anymore. I don\u2019t want to hear about it again.\u201d", "I\u2019m capable of asserting myself, but I\u2019m not going to risk my job over this. I need the money. And if biting my tongue is the only way to assure I keep this job, I\u2019ll do it.", "Start putting them in now no need to wait", "Is your manager banging Nina or something?? He/she is clearly playing favorites and should be demoted from their position. Nina broke the rules and had her kid been mangled the company would not have been happy.", "So inappropriate.", "Sorry if I offended you.", "The money I\u2019m making here is decent and I can\u2019t risk a switch to worse money rn. I won\u2019t be in a stable situation for that until Christmas.", "I think Nina didn\u2019t tell the full story, because the assistant manager just approached me to apologize for the whole incident saying she didn\u2019t know the sit down was gonna happen and that she took up for me in the conversation that preceded this all. She was also surprised when i mentioned the puppies and the register phone call and said she had no idea all that happened.", "?? I didn\u2019t say you did. I\u2019m just clarifying that I have no issue asserting myself, I simply weighed value of asserting myself in the moment against the possible repercussions of doing so, and realized it wasn\u2019t a safe move.", "I didn't say you said I did!  Was offering a sincere apology because actually I hate people telling me what to do and I told you what to do and I was wrong.", "Oooh. I understand. No worries abt that, we\u2019re cool \ud83d\udc4d"]}
