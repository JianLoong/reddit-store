I was a drag queen and he was the security guard. We started dating 8 years ago and got married 3 years ago. I come from a Christian Republican family in the south. So naturally my family was against me marrying him. There\u2019s been threats to have me taken to conversion camps many times. \nThe story: every year we have a big family reunion. And I\u2019ve gone every year but since I got married to my husband we\u2019ve been made to either sleep in a hotel together OR I take my bed and he takes the couch. They don\u2019t do this with any other families until I married my husband. This caused many issues between me, my husband and my family. But after the first year I started have a suspicion I\u2019m the only one getting a hotel room. \nThis was confirmed last week when we had the family reunion and I showed up earlier than planned with my husband. I was supposed to show up at 10 but I showed up with my husband at 8:30 with breakfast for my parents (I thought it was just them.) Everyone was in their own rooms and then a fight broke out. My mom saw me and yelled at me for being early. So I dropped the breakfast and made a mess. Then I yelled at my mom for lying to me. My father showed up and yelled at me for yelling at my mom. Then my husband got in the middle of us (mind you he\u2019s 6\u20195, I\u2019m 6\u20190, my dad is 5\u201910) at which point the rest of my family was getting out of their rooms (the ones who weren\u2019t already out) and so I yelled at them for treating me differently.\nMy husband then got me and took my hand and took me out. He took my car keys and we ended up driving back to our hotel room. \nI cried for about an hour while my family was calling me and texting me. \nWhere I may be the asshole: My cousin called me me today and told me I need to be understanding as me being gay and having a husband makes the family uncomfortable when we sleep together.  And it wasn\u2019t fair on the family for me to lash out at them. And that I needed to make a public apology to the family to help lessen the issues. But I told her it wasn\u2019t fair I\u2019m being treated different than everyone else. Which just made us yell at eachother again.

They are wrong. Please think about this because therapy will also be good and once again your family is wrong. Sorry your bio family sucks! Personally I would not waste my time or energy on them. Your husband and family sound supportive; I would spend time with the family if you heart!", "I spoke with my husband and we\u2019re searching for a therapist to help me and such. Abd he\u2019s going to help me out with being out and apart of the queer community", "Emotionally closed off is not helpful for a kid. But, therapy does wonders. And you can have therapy even if you're scared of it. Just mention it to the therapist - I am scared of being here. Everyone is; what if I discover something horrible? What if I end up crying my eyes out? What if I am judged?", "Oh sweetheart.  I\u2019m sorry.  I\u2019m sorry your parents love bigotry more than you. \n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. You deserve better than this. You deserve parents who love you freely.\n\nI\u2019m so incredibly glad you found a partner who loves you and stands with you. \n\nYou deserve better than your parents.  You deserve love. And respect.  And equality. \n\nNTA.", "Oh, sweetheart. I\u2019m a lesbian married to a woman who grew up in a big family much like yours. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Welcome to the rainbow. We love you. Their bigotry is not your fault.", "I'm from the SE part of the USA. Your family is doing you dirty. They need to get their noses out of your bed and treat you like the family that you are. I mean, I would understand if there was a bedroom shortage because someone would need to get a hotel room. But it shouldn't be you every single time.\n\nI say step back for a bit and do a bit of thinking. Decide what you can and can not accept. Set your boundaries. Then write a letter to your parents and other relatives that you wish. Apologize only for your actions (yelling), but not your statements. Then, lay out your boundaries. Advise that if they can't accept them, then you can't accept their decisions.\n\nSometimes, you have to draw the line in the sand and stick with it. Especially with family. \n\nI wish you the best. This 53 year old gets that family is difficult. Especially the conservative ones.", "No they\u2019re not. DNA might say one thing but their actions say another, and family don\u2019t treat family how they are treating you. \n\n\nIf that kind of bigotry is what they\u2019re willing to say to your face\u2014\u201cyou need to apologize for our homophobia\u201d\u2014god knows what they\u2019re saying behind your back.", "I have new fanfic ideas.", "You and my husbands sister would be like best friends", "I'm glad to hear this. And also, as a veteran of therapy, please -- if you don't \"click\" with the first person, try another. And another, and another, if necessary. I've probably been to 15 therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists in my many years of, ahem, issues, and there have only been 3 I've really felt completely comfortable with. It's not going to help you if you're not comfortable. And there IS someone out there just right for you. Best of luck to you and your husband. <3"]}
