It is not your fault or your responsibility, and you owe him absolutely nothing for being his child.\n\nMy father did this kind of shit to me when I was growing up. In order to feed and house myself, I had a full time job when I was a senior in high school (I was 18 then).

They may be able to let you take your GED and enroll as early as the upcoming semester or summer session at the very least. They make these concessions sometime for student athletes that they want to work with early, or people in situations like your.\n\nLastly-not to be preachy but 2 things I learned in hindsight after getting out of a way less severe situation like yours, but one that was still unhealthy for me: \n\nAsking people for help is essential. Your college likely has nearly infinite resources to help you grow as a human way beyond academics. Learn self care early.\n\nAnd two-seek out healthy male role models and mentors. Driven, high achieving young men like you often find themselves setting ridiculously high bar for themselves in all areas of their lives because the only thing we know is who we DON\u2019T want to be. \nFind people you do want to be like.

Well, take a wild guess.", "It definitely isn't fair on OP, and it's even more unfair his extended family, except for the aunt, are ganging up on him in defense of the father who doesn't want him.", "man, if I was one of your kids I would never talk to dad's family ever again.", "Oh, they don't.  One daughter is contacted by her grandfather but she only keeps in touch because that side is in the same career field so she gave him the number so she could claim references.

Colleges and universities in the US are legally not allowed to give out information about their students, but mistakes can still happen. Contact your college or university as soon as possible. Ask for Student Services. Let them know your family situation. Tell them you are afraid your abusive father will try to gain access to your information or that he will try to impersonate you and revoke your acceptance or decline your scholarship. Ask if they can put an extra password or other kid of security on your file. \n\nPlease also ask if there are any extra programs or resources for students in your situation. I have experience working for a university, and there are often extra grants, things like food share programs, and counseling/group therapy resources for students who have no family support or whose families are actively abusive. They often also have emergency housing, which you will need next year if the college closes the dorms over Christmas and summer break (many do). Please ask about these specific things so you can either start planning how to fill in the gaps, or be able to start school with the confidence that there aren't any gaps. It will make a world of difference to your academic performance to not have this extra stress. \n\nFrom this parent to you- you got this. Go get em, kiddo.", "Big NTA.

Good luck with your academic endeavor \u2764\ufe0f", "I know you said to make a plan on how to pay without financial aid, and I completely agree with your point...that said, since you brought up financial aid I feel like it couldn't hurt to add this bit of advice up here.\n\nOP, if you are in the US try to make sure your future FAFSA situation is squared away. As soon as you are living on your own, secure the legal address change and make sure you have solid proof that you are no longer under his roof or reliant on him in any way.\n\nI have seen so many cases of young students realizing that they need their parents' tax returns to get the FAFSA submitted, and the parents are either too paranoid, too lazy, or too spiteful to locate them and submit them to help their kids with college. I have seen promising students give up on college because their scholarships would expire before they were even old enough to complete the FAFSA without a parents' help. Without a properly completed FAFSA even most financial aid that you don't have to pay back (scholarships, grants, etc.) is out of reach. Even if they have been living on their own long enough to qualify, they are't always able to secure proof.\n\nOne of the ways to get an exemption to requiring your parents' tax forms is to have solid proof that you are living on your own. Mail/bank statements sent to your new address, Driver's License, the works. Act quick on these and work with the college's financial aid office as soon as you can and you should be able to work an exemption to it if your father decides to be petty.\n\nAlso, the IRS data retrieval tool could potentially prevent this entirely. Thankfully it worked for me and I only had to go through the hell of getting my parent's tax returns once.\n\nNTA, OP.
