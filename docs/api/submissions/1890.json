Get out as soon as you can, I'm sure you're aunt will help you if you need it.", "Are you expecting him to contribute to expenses such as housing, books, food, tuition, health insurance, car insurance, phone, internet while in college? Are you expecting him to use his income to fill out the FAFSA to get the aid? Or will scholarships and a job pay for everything?", "While I think you're dad is definitely a jerk, you must have known he wouldn't take that news well and would kick you out right? That is his right to not house you when you're an adult and if you so badly don't want him to know where you are as an adult, you will have to figure something else out (friend, relative, short term stay at a hotel, etc ).

Get away from your abusive family.", "He has to keep you there until you turn 18 And you don't have to pay rent. Keep your money and keep it from him and he decides not to let you stay or refuses to care for you just call the police and child services for neglect. \n\nDon't be afraid to do this because once in the system you qualify for free resources, in some cases fully funded college with a stipend.\n\nI am married and left my husband who said if I went to college he would quit his job and stop paying for the kids.  I went to college and have an AA, BA and I'm working on my MFA. him, his family,  his friends, my family and friends...no one knows about it. People on my side still talk about how I need to go to school and him and his side talk about how I'm uneducated and will work at Walmart for life once the kids move out. \n\nGo NC with him and everyone else. Focus on your education and getting experience.  Make your money and know that once you do they will come crawling with statements that you owe them something and you think you are too good to help them out.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them a thing and you are too good to surround yourself with people who wouldn't help a child who was family. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but maybe tell him the wrong place?", "YTA, he should have not let you live with him, did you pay rent? I would have more sympathy for you but I have teenage children and yall don't appreciate shit.\n\nObviously he cares or he wouldn't give a shit about where you live or go to college..", "NTA that was my thought too, live with the aunt for a while.", "He doesn\u2019t pay for anything now. I have a job that pays for my phone and food and I pay him rent for my room.

They still make comments about how I'm uneducated and will work at Walmart and never go to college. \n\nBut I have an AA, BA and now I am working on a MFA degree all while raising kids and keeping a 4.0 GPA for 5 years. \n\nCan be done as long as she keeps her mouth close and the aunt says nothing. Good chance aunt will say nothing due to the trauma and the dad can't ask colleges for the information if he isn't signed up with her account.", "Projecting much?", "She is his daughter and under the age of 18 so she shouldn't be paying rent. He should have been raising her from day one, not her grandparents. He is a deadbeat dad who is now forced to care for his child and he is trying to punish her for it. \n\nOP is smart to stay away because once she graduates he is gonna claim that she somehow owes him. Nope!", "Wait what? Isn't that a parent's responsibility to house their children? If your children don't appreciate you then that's on you for failing to parent. That doesn't mean it's the same for OP. NTA", "Yes I do. He kicked me out when I was 13 and I lived with my grandmother. She died so my 6 months ago so he let me move back in.", "So I guess you support kicking out a 13 year old because your girlfriend asked you to", "He is literally obligated by law to let her live with him.", "Tell him, he can kick you out, but you will let everyone know how he kicked out his child for his gf.", "You shouldn't even be paying him rent. I don't know much about it, but people on here are always saying parents have a legal obligation to house and feed their kids up until 18 (in the US I think). I don't know what you can do about this aspect of the situation though, short of the usual 'call CPS'... But who knows what and if there'd be anything good to come out of that. Hopefully some more well informed people on here could point you in the right direction. Why did you get kicked out at 13?", "Projecting what? I said it straight up...", "You must not have teenagers..they tend to take things super personal and make shit way worse then it has to be.", "NTA but I would add this to your post", "I get it, its a change going from grandma's to dad's house.", "Everybody already knows this as it was nearly 5 years ago. The girlfriend has already left him", "Thing like this is wild to me like it might be because I'm asian living in an asian country but even the shittiest of parents know they shouldn't charge rent for their kids that they themselves brought into this world.", "He had a girlfriend that he wanted to move in but she said she wouldn\u2019t move in with a teenager. That\u2019s the nicest way I can put it without going into too much detail and getting the post removed", "Just bc you raised your children to hate you doesn't mean they're all ungrateful shits. Just means you either raised ungrateful shits or your children don't like you. That's on you", "That's on you. You raised them that way.", "A change...moving back in with the man that kicked them out at 13.", "Lol. My children hate me? Ungrateful shits? Okay, nevermind cause this went way over your head .", "Okay lol", "The real world isn't gonna be like grandmas"]}
