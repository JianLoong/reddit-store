Get out as soon as you can, I'm sure you're aunt will help you if you need it.", "Are you expecting him to contribute to expenses such as housing, books, food, tuition, health insurance, car insurance, phone, internet while in college? Are you expecting him to use his income to fill out the FAFSA to get the aid? Or will scholarships and a job pay for everything?", "While I think you're dad is definitely a jerk, you must have known he wouldn't take that news well and would kick you out right? That is his right to not house you when you're an adult and if you so badly don't want him to know where you are as an adult, you will have to figure something else out (friend, relative, short term stay at a hotel, etc ). NTA for making a choice that's best for you, but you'll just have to deal with the consequences of finding a new place to live until college starts.", "NTA but think of the consequences.\nIt may be worth biting the bullet and telling him where you\u2019re going now so that you have a place to stay then as soon as you\u2019re able get somewhere else.\n\nIf your aunt is able to give you a roof over your head could that be an option?", "Can\u2019t you lie to him?", "I'm not going to call you an asshole on this, because I'm sure you have your reasons. \n\nHowever... he's going to find out anyway.

Get away from your abusive family.", "He has to keep you there until you turn 18 And you don't have to pay rent. Keep your money and keep it from him and he decides not to let you stay or refuses to care for you just call the police and child services for neglect. \n\nDon't be afraid to do this because once in the system you qualify for free resources, in some cases fully funded college with a stipend.\n\nI am married and left my husband who said if I went to college he would quit his job and stop paying for the kids.  I went to college and have an AA, BA and I'm working on my MFA. him, his family,  his friends, my family and friends...no one knows about it. People on my side still talk about how I need to go to school and him and his side talk about how I'm uneducated and will work at Walmart for life once the kids move out. \n\nGo NC with him and everyone else. Focus on your education and getting experience.  Make your money and know that once you do they will come crawling with statements that you owe them something and you think you are too good to help them out.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe them a thing and you are too good to surround yourself with people who wouldn't help a child who was family. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but maybe tell him the wrong place?", "YTA, he should have not let you live with him, did you pay rent? I would have more sympathy for you but I have teenage children and yall don't appreciate shit.\n\nObviously he cares or he wouldn't give a shit about where you live or go to college..", "NTA that was my thought too, live with the aunt for a while.", "He doesn\u2019t pay for anything now. I have a job that pays for my phone and food and I pay him rent for my room. I don\u2019t expect anything at all off him when I go to college", "Not true, I'm getting my masters and my Husband, Father, and my family know nothing about it. They still make comments about how I'm uneducated and will work at Walmart and never go to college. \n\nBut I have an AA, BA and now I am working on a MFA degree all while raising kids and keeping a 4.0 GPA for 5 years. \n\nCan be done as long as she keeps her mouth close and the aunt says nothing. Good chance aunt will say nothing due to the trauma and the dad can't ask colleges for the information if he isn't signed up with her account.", "Projecting much?", "She is his daughter and under the age of 18 so she shouldn't be paying rent. He should have been raising her from day one, not her grandparents. He is a deadbeat dad who is now forced to care for his child and he is trying to punish her for it. \n\nOP is smart to stay away because once she graduates he is gonna claim that she somehow owes him. Nope!", "Wait what? Isn't that a parent's responsibility to house their children? If your children don't appreciate you then that's on you for failing to parent. That doesn't mean it's the same for OP. NTA", "Yes I do. He kicked me out when I was 13 and I lived with my grandmother. She died so my 6 months ago so he let me move back in.", "So I guess you support kicking out a 13 year old because your girlfriend asked you to", "He is literally obligated by law to let her live with him.", "Tell him, he can kick you out, but you will let everyone know how he kicked out his child for his gf.", "You shouldn't even be paying him rent. I don't know much about it, but people on here are always saying parents have a legal obligation to house and feed their kids up until 18 (in the US I think). I don't know what you can do about this aspect of the situation though, short of the usual 'call CPS'... But who knows what and if there'd be anything good to come out of that. Hopefully some more well informed people on here could point you in the right direction. Why did you get kicked out at 13?", "Projecting what? I said it straight up...", "You must not have teenagers..they tend to take things super personal and make shit way worse then it has to be.", "NTA but I would add this to your post", "I get it, its a change going from grandma's to dad's house.", "Everybody already knows this as it was nearly 5 years ago. The girlfriend has already left him", "Thing like this is wild to me like it might be because I'm asian living in an asian country but even the shittiest of parents know they shouldn't charge rent for their kids that they themselves brought into this world.", "He had a girlfriend that he wanted to move in but she said she wouldn\u2019t move in with a teenager. That\u2019s the nicest way I can put it without going into too much detail and getting the post removed", "Just bc you raised your children to hate you doesn't mean they're all ungrateful shits. Just means you either raised ungrateful shits or your children don't like you. That's on you", "That's on you. You raised them that way.", "A change...moving back in with the man that kicked them out at 13.", "Lol. My children hate me? Ungrateful shits? Okay, nevermind cause this went way over your head .", "Okay lol", "The real world isn't gonna be like grandmas", "NTA. His intentions for knowing your address are probably not good. Grab your freedom and go!", "NTA Is there a trusted school counselor or teacher you can confide it? Maybe they know of temporary housing if your dad kicks you out.", "NTA. Wait wait wait, your whole family are angry at **you** and not your dad?! A child who got abandoned at 13 years old. Where were they when you were kicked out of the house? Did they even bother to call your father out for being a failure of a parent. They must all share one braincell with each other. \n\nHe 'let' you live with him. Wow, how caring of him /s", "NTA Move in with your aunt or friends if you can and get a job. He says he \"gave up alot?\" LOL! He couldn't even stay in your life for 17 consecutive years! Don't give him any money, btw, he's obligated to let you live with him until you turn 18.", "NTA. But... why? It will create a problem for you to NOT tell him. But what problem will it create if you DO tell him?", "Can you stay with your aunt? She sounds like the only sane relative you have. NTA.", "Nta. But you need to put a plan together for the time between turning 18 and you can leave for college.\nYou already have a job, look into how much it costs to rent a room locally -will that be affordable? Do you have any friends who's parents will let you live there for a few months? Talk to a guidance counsellor or teacher and see what resources they have access to that can help. Find out what government benefits you would be eligible for. Call social services and see what they can recommend. If you were in foster care at all there are likely programs that will help you. Find out what options are available for you to move to your college early at the start of summer. Schools often rent out dorms through the summer. Where is you mom?\n\nSome other things to note. You need a bank account that your dad doesn't have access to - so you can save as much as possible for when you move out. Move out all important paperwork - birth certificate, passport, driving license etc. Put together a list of things you will need when you move out - bedding, plate and bowl, cutlery, sauce pan etc. So you can quickly acquire the items or pick them up before you move out. Look at 2nd hand shops.", "No! Read OP's other comments! He's definitely up to no good and will try to sabotage their progress.", "They always side with my dad. They say I must make him too angry. My grandmother spent 3 years trying to get me away from him before I moved in with her", "Stop paying him rent, save your money until you move out.", "Stop that. He can't kick you out until you turn 18 and he doesn't deserve a cent.", "I'm so sorry this happened to you. Why does your dad want to know where you are heading to study? Is he very controlling? I know it's normal for parents to want to know where their kids are studying, but you seem scared of him knowing? Would he cause problems for you?", "I know he will do something to stop me going if he knows where. I can\u2019t afford it if I don\u2019t have my scholarship even with working. He isn\u2019t the nicest person and has anger issues. Everybody knows this but most of his anger is aimed towards me. He doesn\u2019t like the fact that I don\u2019t look like him and I look like my mom. He says that I ruined his family because all the sons in his family look like their father.", "I'm sorry again that you are going through this. I really hope you can get out. All I can think is that you are actually in an abusive situation and may qualify to get help from charities, but I'm not in the US so I'm unsure what is available in your area. I can only wish you the very best and good luck with your studies, plus advise you to warn your uni that nobody is to un-enroll you, and not to give our your information. Same for telling anyone you don't trust 100%."]}
