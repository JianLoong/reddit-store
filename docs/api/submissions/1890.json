Find out what government benefits you would be eligible for. Call social services and see what they can recommend. If you were in foster care at all there are likely programs that will help you. Find out what options are available for you to move to your college early at the start of summer. Schools often rent out dorms through the summer. Where is you mom?\n\nSome other things to note.

Move out all important paperwork - birth certificate, passport, driving license etc. Put together a list of things you will need when you move out - bedding, plate and bowl, cutlery, sauce pan etc. So you can quickly acquire the items or pick them up before you move out.

You do what you need to do for yourself. He's obviously not acting in your best interests.\n\nFor one, it is absolutely ridiculous for your father to leverage the burden of raising you.

It is not your fault or your responsibility, and you owe him absolutely nothing for being his child.\n\nMy father did this kind of shit to me when I was growing up. In order to feed and house myself, I had a full time job when I was a senior in high school (I was 18 then).

They may be able to let you take your GED and enroll as early as the upcoming semester or summer session at the very least. They make these concessions sometime for student athletes that they want to work with early, or people in situations like your.\n\nLastly-not to be preachy but 2 things I learned in hindsight after getting out of a way less severe situation like yours, but one that was still unhealthy for me: \n\nAsking people for help is essential. Your college likely has nearly infinite resources to help you grow as a human way beyond academics. Learn self care early.\n\nAnd two-seek out healthy male role models and mentors. Driven, high achieving young men like you often find themselves setting ridiculously high bar for themselves in all areas of their lives because the only thing we know is who we DON\u2019T want to be. \nFind people you do want to be like. Realize they are human too and model elements of your life around the good traits and learn to accept and forgive your own flaws and those in others.\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, but maybe just lie to him about where you\u2019re going until you can actually go.", "Unless he's paying then NTA.", "NTA.

You are awesome!", "You should have seen my older two when he said it at the dinner table. The oldest was starting college. \n\nHe always talked about the racists things like how his stro mother wouldn't  allow him to play with the black kids, and I noticed things with his family....but it really went down hill with him about.   Well, take a wild guess.", "It definitely isn't fair on OP, and it's even more unfair his extended family, except for the aunt, are ganging up on him in defense of the father who doesn't want him.", "man, if I was one of your kids I would never talk to dad's family ever again.", "Oh, they don't.  One daughter is contacted by her grandfather but she only keeps in touch because that side is in the same career field so she gave him the number so she could claim references. The uncle and one aunt are decent...the siblings are decent to a degree. There are some issues but not the straight up homophobic, racist, sexist BS.\n\nOther kids haven't seen or talked since 2018. \n\nI told him that the kids would catch on to the favoritism and micro aggressions. He didn\u2019t believe me. \n\nNow he sulks cus his friends are starting families, we started early, and he is living the single life cus his kids are wanting nothing to do with him.", "Amplifying what u/sneakyscott said. Colleges and universities in the US are legally not allowed to give out information about their students, but mistakes can still happen. Contact your college or university as soon as possible. Ask for Student Services. Let them know your family situation. Tell them you are afraid your abusive father will try to gain access to your information or that he will try to impersonate you and revoke your acceptance or decline your scholarship. Ask if they can put an extra password or other kid of security on your file. \n\nPlease also ask if there are any extra programs or resources for students in your situation. I have experience working for a university, and there are often extra grants, things like food share programs, and counseling/group therapy resources for students who have no family support or whose families are actively abusive. They often also have emergency housing, which you will need next year if the college closes the dorms over Christmas and summer break (many do). Please ask about these specific things so you can either start planning how to fill in the gaps, or be able to start school with the confidence that there aren't any gaps. It will make a world of difference to your academic performance to not have this extra stress. \n\nFrom this parent to you- you got this. Go get em, kiddo."]}
