My brother said that it\u2019s better for my nephew to think I forgot his birthday than for my nephew to think my brother forgot his birthday. He said it would hurt the kid much less being let down by his uncle than being let down by his dad.\n\nBut I really don\u2019t want my nephew to think I forgot his birthday. Would I be selfish if I refuse to go along with this?\n\nI\u2019m going over to their place in two hours and he wants me to hand him the box outside the house.\n\nUPDATE : Thank you everyone for your suggestions. I first advised him to give his son pocket money but he doesn\u2019t like the idea, worrying that my nephew would \u2018spend it all on chocolates.\u2019 So I told him I can buy a LEGO set before going to his house and he can pay me for it.
