He hasn\u2019t gotten a gift and wants to give my nephew the gift I bought, passing it off as being from him.\n\nI told him that if we do that then my nephew would think I forgot his birthday since I only got one gift and hasn\u2019t got another one to give him. My brother said that it\u2019s better for my nephew to think I forgot his birthday than for my nephew to think my brother forgot his birthday. He said it would hurt the kid much less being let down by his uncle than being let down by his dad.\n\nBut I really don\u2019t want my nephew to think I forgot his birthday. Would I be selfish if I refuse to go along with this?\n\nI\u2019m going over to their place in two hours and he wants me to hand him the box outside the house.", "created_utc": 1689385448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zym1s/wibta_for_not_letting_my_brother_pass_my_birthday/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dad can put cash in a card and call it a day. My sons loved cash/gift cards at that age.", "Hell no.

Your brother fucked up and he didn't even ask if he could say the present was from both of you.\n\nSeriously though, he should be able to fix this very easily.
