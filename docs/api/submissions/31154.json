Everyone got kinda quiet and stared at us, and I realized I might have just exposed her well-kept secret. Naturally, everyone started asking if they could see the tattoo, but Jessica seemed really embarrassed and so she fled the scene and hid in her car. It's been about an hour and I think she's still in there and the atmosphere at the reunion has been a bit awkward ever since. I feel kinda bad, but I didn't make her blurt out that she had a tattoo.

OP was making it all about themselves and trying to be a clown or a prankster or something.", "Asking is not what makes OP the AH. It's the public, loud aspect of it. If you are truly worried, curious about someone you care about acting fishy, you go about it discreetly. That being said, it might be 50 years of experience talking. Tact and discretion with people I care about was learned the hard way. Maybe it's a lesson for OP. I'm sorry for the cousin mainly and a bit for OP because I do not believe there was any malice here. However, intent means shit when the result is making the other feel bad anyway,", "Who gives a shit where she put the tattoo? If she wants a tattoo on her wrist, she\u2019s within her right to put it there.

Why did OP put her on the spot and didn't ask her in secret if they really wanted to know? Instead, OP asked her so loud that everyone knew. That's rude af.

Did he make an unintentional mistake? Sure. That doesn't make him an asshole. \n\nThe unrelated question of whether the person has made a mistake with the tattoo or its placement is not relevant, but if you don't like a tattoo or don't like it's placement after the fact, that is on tattoo'd person not the op. Also, I'm NOT saying that it gives people the right to oogle or whatever, but that doesn't change the fact that it will happen if you put it somewhere visible.", "Exactly she sees these people including OP once a year. Some people really can\u2019t just leave others alone", "She made sure that it wasn't visible at that moment, but OP spoiled it. If we only call people the ahole when the do something bad intentionally, there would be a significant less aholes on this sub. Also, OP is an adult. He should have learned by now that if someone doesn't want to share something, don't press them while everyone is around. It's not that hard."]}
