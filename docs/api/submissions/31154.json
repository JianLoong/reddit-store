Guess what, it wasn\u2019t a tattoo but 5 cigarette burns on my forearm. It would have been nice to not have to talk about that with everyone but fuck me I guess. Your assumption that their assumption is correct is ignorant and so what if it\u2019s a tattoo discretion in a situation the cousin clearly wanted it should have been respected.

If she was trying to hide a tattoo, why would she admit it so easily? A secret tattoo is probably less embarrassing than cuts. \n\nHe never even saw the supposed tattoo.

That makes sense, though.", "When I got my tattoo found out from using a clear straw and I got caught I owned up to it like she did.

Point is we have no idea and likely never will but it could be a million and one things but at the end of the day OP should have minded his fucking business or spoke to the cousin in private about it when they were alone as to not bring up something she was clearly hiding for good reason and not only embarrassing the cousin but potentially pushing her away if it was something where she actually needed help with. Getting called out like that isn\u2019t exactly going to instill trust. I had cigarette burns on my wrist and tried hiding it with long sleeves and it got brought by a family member up in front of everyone so I sympathize with this cousin more than most would ever know and it is very traumatic and upsetting when I clearly wore a shirt meant to cover it and tried to brush it off but no they just couldn\u2019t drop it.

The former is not necessarily a problem (though much depends on context \u2013 the relationship between the person asking and the person being asked, the way the question is asked, etc.), but the latter is. OP opted for the latter.

These would once have been incredibly normal and acceptable things to say, but that doesnt mean it was right. Just because it's a family reunion doesn't mean people get to be dicks.
