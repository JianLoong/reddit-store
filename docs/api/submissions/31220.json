I worked almost 9 years taking my clients to their appointments. I've heard several doctors suggest diets and watching calories.  I've never ever heard of a Dr recommending less than 1500 calories a day.  And that one was only cause the guardian demanded it.  And these were pretty inactive people.

If you kept strictly to 1200 calories every day you would eventually die of starvation/malnutrition as your body cannibalized itself bit by bit to try to survive. \n\nHell, on bed rest you use more than 1200 calories a day, and every bit more exercise you do, even just walking around and sitting/standing throughout the day, take more calories. Schoolwork? More calories. Chores? A lot more calories. Sports? A LOT more calories.", "if he's a teenager he probably needs to eat extra anyway, teen boys need calories to fuel their growth.", "I'm hoping Bible Study Fellowship which if it is adds a whole other set of problems to the issue.", "My teen brother was a football/wrestler/lacrosse player and could easily eat 10K calories and not gain weight while training.
