Your mom sounds like she needs psychological help and maybe a trip to a certified nutritionist.\n\n>I stated to feel really bad, every time I see her she looks like a ghost, she\u2019s really pale and her eyes are always red.\n\nYour mom sounds like she's in crisis which isn't easier to treat when malnourished. I'd talk to your dad about finding her some help. NTA.", "NTA, but your dad needs to step up and get your mom some help. She seems to have some kind of unhealthy control issues/fixation around food, and what she's doing is actually legally considered child abuse, because she is deliberately withholding food from him - something he needs to live, and that she's legally required to give him.\n\nThis is beyond the scope of Reddit, really, but you've done nothing wrong, and your brother should continue eating as much food as he needs with zero guilt.", "NTA. Your mother is abusing you by inflicting her own insecurities and trauma with food on you guys. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to get CFS or some other social service involved.\n\nThis is abuse.", "This is abusive. 1200 calories a day is usually the minimum they recommend to function, and that\u2019s for an average person not someone who\u2019s body is growing or is an athlete.\n\nSomething major is going in with your mom, and I fear it\u2019s more than (serious) control issues. I think she is in a mental health crisis. This reaction is so extreme, this whole situation is.\n\nWhat reason did she give for you all changing your diets? Why do you think it caused her to. It just be angry but essentially sob?? This is extremely worrying OP. Your mom needs help from a professional. And you and your brother need to absolutely not be following this diet she\u2019s trying to out on you.", "NTA, everyone has different needs of intake, and a growing, very active boy needs a lot more than an inactive grown woman (for example)\nBut 3 x 350 is an unhealthy low amount for anyone. \n\nYour mom needs to see a therapist and dietitian. She has literally been starving her family.", "NTA\n\nThis is very dysfunctional and it's completely inappropriate for your mother to withhold food (from any of you). Everyone's body is different and in particular a growing teen who does a lot of sports needs to eat much more than some others. Not to mention that you said your mother doesn't know much about eating healthy so it seems she's just limiting calories and forcing everyone to go with her \"diet\" which is wrong and harmful.", "Your mom is literally starving your brother.\nAre any of you even overweight?", "NTA. You were helping your brother get enough food to not wither away. I can't think of a world where that's wrong", "NTA.  This is how eating disorders are formed.", "Good lord, that\u2019s terrible \n\nAccording to the 2020\u20132025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, most adult females require between 1,600 and 2,000 calories, and adult males between 2,000 and 2,400 calories, per day. An active teenage boy needs on average 2600 to 3200 calories a day. \nMost people will lose weight following a 1,500- to 1,800-calorie diet.\n\nYour mom is feeding the whole family substantially less even than that. \n\nThat will have some seriously harmful effects, and sooner rather than later. \n\nI wonder if part of why your mom looks like a ghost and always has bloodshot eyes is because she is actively starving herself as well. \n\nShe seriously need to see someone. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA, but your mother needs help. This is not normal, and I'm seeing some red flags for problems that go beyond just wanting unhealthy amounts of control.", "This is abuse and your parents should be reported to the authorities for food deprivation of their children. NTA", "So I'd ether get cps involved or have a medical professional document your brothers weight loss and have a meal/Diet plan made by a nutritionist.\n\nI'd also try talking to your dad with your brother to find out, how he's doing with this and maybe you can convince her together.\nOr maybe you have other family like aunts or grandparents, try to get them on your side, sometimes you need to be told by your parents or older siblings to listen. \n\nThis could be a serious sing of and eating disorder on your mom's part and she need a wake up call badly.", "Oh man, definitely NTA - maybe you and/or your brother could talk to his coach or a guidance counselor or something who could then have a conversation with your parents about how problematic a forced diet is a very dangerous thing. Especially such a rigid one and with an athlete who is burning *far* more calories than he is taking in. It's both physically and emotionally harmful. \n\nHopefully your mom can handle the reality check and get herself in therapy, she needs it stat.", "Nta.  Your mom's crazy.  Yeah, that's a tasteless way to put it but it's true -- major issues around food and control there.  What's your dad doing in this?  Your mum should be primarily his problem.", "NTA and this is child neglect.", "Nta my exes missus goes on loads of diets and expected everyone to eat like her. My two would come home hungry and moan about it. Its not healthy for most people to only eat a little when they're very active.", "NTA. That is far too few calories for him, and honestly too little for the rest of you too. That\u2019s the kind of brutal restriction that people do when they need to lose weight as an emergency.  I\u2019m sorry, but this is abuse. It sounds as though your mother also needs some help.", "Your mother is deranged and dangerous. Every person has an individual calorie minimum. She just decided four people all need just 1,050 calories each?? That\u2019s abusive. NTA", "NTA.  The amount of calories (350 x3) is starvation for EVERYONE, much less a teenaged boy playing sports.  Thank you for looking out for your brother.  This is a situation in which I would call CPS if I were your friend's parents.", "Tell his coach that she is starving him. Then sit back and watch the consequences to your parents.", "Suggestion for your brother to eat better than consuming fast food.   Lean protein, veggies.
