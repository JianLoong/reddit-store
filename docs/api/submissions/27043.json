{"id": 27043, "submission_id": "16kziw5", "title": "AITA for telling my aunt that people like her make foreigners think Filipinas are gold diggers", "selftext": "I (27F), Filipina, have been living in NY since 2014. I went to nursing school here, graduated last 2018, started working on the same year, and have been a CRNA for almost 3 years now. I met my partner (30M, Marco) through a mutual friend and we've been dating for almost 4 years now. My family has met my bf a couple of times when they would visit me here in NY.\n\nA little family background: both of my parents (57M, 49F) are surgeons in the Philippines and they still give financial support to their respective family from time to time. My aunt (dad's sister) is heavily dependent on my dad- she's a SAHM, her husband doesn't work full time, and they have 3 kids (2 in college). My dad would give her Php 30k per month and it's still not enough for her. While my dad can give more, I still have 3 younger siblings (1 who has special needs) who are studying and my parents are also saving for retirement, so dad refuses to give more than that.\n\nA week ago, Marco and I went to the Philippines so he can formally ask my parents' permission to marry me. My whole family and some relatives were there and it was a sweet and fun dinner. We went for to a restaurant for desserts and while waiting for our orders, we were talking about some wedding plans and Marco and I told my parents that while we don't have a specific date yet (planning to get married late next year) we plan to get married in CA. We asked my parents to be present; and for my relatives, we told them they are welcome to join us but we can only afford to pay for max 1 week of accommodation for 20 adults and they will be paying for their own plane fare, food, visa, etc. This is where the night started to turn bad: my aunt said that she can't afford to buy tickets and get visas for 5 people and that we should just sponsor her. We replied that we can't do that since we are paying everything for the wedding and we don't wish to go over our budget. My parents also explained to her that while we would love to have them, we are not forcing her to spend that much money. My aunt then said (roughly translated to English equivalent): \"Marco is a foreigner, I'm sure he can afford to pay for us.\" I quickly shut her down, but she continued with \"You're marrying a foreigner, but he can't afford to do that for us? Is he not rich? Foreigners have a lot of money. If he can't afford to do that, why marry him? Marry someone rich.\" I was floored and ashamed and I told her that people like her, who sees foreigners as money, are the reason why foreigners think Filipinas are gold diggers. I said that out loud in front of my other relatives and some customers for sure heard it. Aunt was humiliated and walked out. Desserts forgotten.\n\nWhat happened spread like wildfire with the rest of the relatives. My family agreed with what I said but a couple of my relatives agreed with my aunt and that what I said have caused a rift in our family dynamics. They told me I should have just told her in person and not in a public place. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT for clarifications: \nAunt's husband used to work full time before the pandemic. Husband is a good man but both of them made poor financial choices. When the pandemic happened, he was one of the thousands who lost their jobs. He has not been working full time since then. Idk if he plans to work full time again. Since 2020, my dad has been giving my aunt's family Php30,000/month. A redditor has explained in the comments the value of that amount.", "created_utc": 1694953978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kziw5/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_that_people_like_her/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What she did was even worse by speaking about your fiance in (I assume) Tagalog in front of his face, knowing he wouldn't understand.      \n\nQuite honestly, you're right. It's that kind of attitude which gives not just Filipinas, but all Filipinos a bad name. It is also, unfortunately, a stereotype based in truth. While not the majority, there are enough Filipinos who believe and act just as she did.     \n\nQuestion you don't have to answer, but did she grow up comfortably, but married \"poorly\" and that's why she struggles now? I have many many many relatives like that who fell on \"hard times\" because of the poor choices they made (mostly women who married outside their sec, but also men who were lazy and thought they could live the high life as haciendero forever). And they are some of the greediest, grabbiest people I've ever known. It's really shameful how they behave.     \n\nETA For anyone wondering, P30,000/month is more than the average bank teller or office worker makes in Manila. Outside Manila, they would make even less. So while it's still not enough to support a family (in Manila, anyway), it's quite a generous sum in the Philippines.", "NTA. Your aunt went over the line. She was milking from your dad and wants to milk from you and your fianc\u00e9 too. You put her in her place and I would\u2019ve prolly done the same. She should be ashamed of herself tbh", "NTA, you said what you needed to say exactly when you needed to say it. She was over the line and you made that clear. Damn right, you didn\u2019t get all of those letters after your name to be unable to stand up to your aunt. Go you. I\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t eat dessert. I bet it was amazing, and that\u2019s a shame. I would have, and had seconds too. Maybe go have the wrap up talk at some point and smooth it out with her, just because she\u2019s family, but\u2026 your answer is still no. FWIW\u2014 I can\u2019t state my professional appreciation for Filipina nurses (and all of the food!) enough. All of the love, you hard-working, super educated, \u201cI make my own money, TYVM,\u201d baddie!", "NTA, why should you be ashamed of saying that in public when she also shamed you in public that your fianc\u00e9 should be rich and questioning your life decision based on race and status. That In its self is humiliating and insensitive. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this, best of luck.", "NTA. I'd have gone further than you. Seeing as she married a man that can not even provide for his family and has to mooch off his BIL...should she really be the one talking about how you should marry rich?", "NTA\n\nYou gave her the option to just shut up but she insisted on being more and mor obnoxious. You shut that down for good and that's positive.", "NTA. Your aunt embarrassed herself.", "NTA, that's embarrasing.", "NTA. Your aunt not only perpetuates a harmful stereotype but actually believes in it.", "You could have de-escalated by suggesting to continue the discussion at another place with more privacy. Not sure if that makes you an asshole, but if it does, then your aunt is an even bigger asshole for saying that shit out loud during your pamamanhikan in a restaurant.", "NTA. Your aunt has been provided for for far too long.", "NTA\n\nYou were totally in the rights.\n\nTwo little disclaimers, though. With current state of global affairs, a person native to the richer countries shouldn't be upset by being seen as a possible source of income. That's a matter of perspective and how it is brought forth and handled. Every relation is also a transaction of sorts. So, while you were right, the stance of your aunt is not wrong per default.\n\nAnd you might have picked the wrong time/place. But I can't blame you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
