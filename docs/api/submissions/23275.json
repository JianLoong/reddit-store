Of course it would probably be best just to establish a no gift policy with them and try to get past the entire debacle, but the fact is that you are having fun with it now and I see no problem with it.

Act like it's the most amazing gift you ever received. Thank them profusely. As soon as you unwrap it, take photos of it and post the pictures to all your social media. Be sure to tag the givers and thank them again in the post.

Your new practice is a perfect reflection of that.

I wish you had a picture of the parasol", "NTA, I wish my ex and I did this with her folks, utterly clueless doesn't even come close.  \nShe's the youngest, loves hard rock, so they got her a Whitney Huston CD. She not only hates her music, she doesn't own a CD player in anything. And it still have the $4.99 sticker on it, they got me a XXL pastel pink and yellow shirt that looked right out of Miami Vice, $2.99 price tag still on it...I wear a medium.", "Nta. That\u2019s hilarious. How did they respond? For the lamp I would have just gone to the thrift store and made sure I left the price there. And I\u2019m petty.

Definitely NTA.", "So the parasol one they laughed and said the colours were a strange choice, they were clearly confused, my husband played a long and said he just thought it was so much cooler.  It was awkward.\n\nThe lamp one she was completely pissed but didn't want to say. We acted like it was a big misunderstanding, you wanted a floor lamp right? It's okay right?

It isn't cruel in the slightest. A dose of their own medicine is what the doctor ordered.", "hahahaha amazing!  I say play the long game here.  The closest but ugliest thing to what they want!  And you can make it into a fun game with the husband....like a scavenger hunt on who can find the winning gift.  Loser cooks dinner.", "I would keep it up until they finally get the hint. It seems like they're fine just giving you whatever, but everything is suddenly different when they don't get the exact thing they asked for. How they can't see that the two situations are exactly the same is mind blowing. Either they're completely thoughtless and/or oblivious or they just don't really care about your husband and you."]}
