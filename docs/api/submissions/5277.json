The baby (along with her 3 other children) were taken away and my great aunt \u201caunt J\u201d took custody of all 4 of them.\n\n*Background: My mom moved to the suburbs of the city I moved to after I graduated. Since my grandma was getting older she decided to sell her large house and moved in with my mom. So it is just us 3 in this state. I have been the youngest in the family until about 5 years ago when my older cousins started having kids. As soon as people started having babies that became everyone\u2019s obsession. The only conversations we had were about potty training or how many blueberries so and so ate. I'm not a kid person and my family claims I don't \u201ccare about the babies\u201d (I was away at college when they were born and couldn't really visit)*\n\nContinued: My grandma makes good money and has supported me and many other family members throughout the years (bought my car when I turned 16, IVF for my cousin, and even bought a home a while ago for aunt J and the rest of her siblings) so when aunt J contacted my grandma for help with Macy's kids, of course, my grandma forked over a ton of money for clothes, food, and Christmas gifts.\n\nI was shopping with my mom recently and she mentioned that Macy is pregnant again!! Aunt J doesn\u2019t know if she will be able to take care of another baby. She said my grandma wanted to take in the baby when it arrives and it could live with my mom and grandma.\n\nI immediately objected. My mom was taken aback because I objected so quickly and tried to guilt me by saying there was nowhere else for the baby to go and if she took it in it would have a great life. I told her I\u2019m not really interested in getting a sibling at 26 and that I\u2019d probably not be as supportive or involved as she\u2019d like. (My mom and I bond over mall shopping, lunch trips, and vacations with each other) I'd probably stop coming around if it meant shlepping around a diaper bag and stroller, I could never see myself babysitting or even hanging out with the child not to mention how embarrassing it would be to tell my friends and future partner I have a random baby \u201csibling\u201d due to a family member that popped pills and her pussy too much.\n\nWe dropped it. But my grandma just left to go back to my home state to visit everyone and their kids for Christmas.\n\nI am nervous that she will commit to taking care of this unborn baby and my life plans as well as my feelings will be ignored.\n\nI meet with my therapist tomorrow and will definitely be talking about this with her, but it is her job to consider my feelings and kind of be on my side so I wanted to get an outsider\u2019s perspective on if I\u2019m the asshole for not wanting to rescue this unborn child that is a result of someone else\u2019s poor decisions.", "created_utc": 1671608448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrdsam/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_to_take_in_a_new_baby/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are an adult living out on your own. Your mom\u2019s decision will in no way ruin your life.

I suggest when you go to therapy tomorrow, discuss why you feel so defensive about the baby becoming part of your family. Are you scared you\u2019ll lose the closeness you have with your mother? Or are you just aggravated by babies? Either way, therapy is the best solution. Like others said, you\u2019re 26. You shouldn\u2019t care to this extent what your mother or your grandmother are doing, especially something as kind and thoughtful as taking in a baby who has no better option. If you\u2019re so embarrassed about carrying around a diaper bag that you\u2019re willing to stop visiting your mother who is compassionate enough to take in a whole human who needs her, you need to reevaluate.

She's a grown ass adult and can make that decision for herself. She also doesn't owe you an explanation or have to listen to your opinion. \n\nYour post screams that you are jealous of sharing attention as you had to mention you were the \"baby of the family\" until cousins started having families of their own and now GoD fOrBiD they talk about those moments in their next step of their lives. \n\nI get not being a fan of kids (my husband and I believe in and are happy with our CF lifestyle) but would never tell someone they can't take in a child or have one because WE don't want that for us or think they shouldn't.

Macy, your mom, grandma, someone else to have some fault but at the end of the day what they do isn't your business or problem. You would want them to be supportive of your decisions. You should at least respect theirs. Sure macy is a screw up. But the baby is innocent. The kids don't deserve to be punished for existing which is kinda what you are implying. Because they embarrass you or inconvenience you. It's your family. Shouldn't you care? Your family is hyper dependent on each other and stuff. I get it.

A grown adult? Oh the horror!", "Threaten you, how? Threaten your life? You\u2019re a grown woman. Your parents have no say.", "this is excellent advice thank you", "She would be more accepting if they didn't put pressure on her to participate in the baby's life and childcare. As stated in the comments.", "Who said you were?", "The responses here are strange to me. I don\u2019t think it would be shallow for someone to not want a second date with you based on that backstory. I wouldn\u2019t. My family doesn\u2019t have any history of drug addiction in it and definitely wouldn\u2019t be welcoming anyone like that into it. You might not be an addict yourself, but if you have addict family that is going to have an impact on my life like showing up with random babies that I might be expected to be responsible for then count me out.", ">And why should they have to worry about someone else\u2019s baby?\n\nThey literally don't, though, did you read the post? OP's mom is the one that wants to take care of the baby. You make it seen like the OP's mom is trying to force OP to do it or something.", "Is anyone asking her to do anything? Her main objections seem to be that she\u2019ll get less attention and be embarrassed. I\u2019m not seeing anything where anyone is asking anything of her.", "We are saying that Macy baby is more important than you, yes. You are a grown ass adult who can take care of yourself and not need coddling. They are taking in a baby who needs support or it will die. Yes. The baby is more important than a grown ass adult.", "How dare they bring a baby into the same state as OPs?! Heretics! /s\n\nStill, not OPs decision to make. They do not even live together. The only decision to be made by OP is weather or not she wants to be part of the childs life. It doesn't matter if they live in separate states or not.", "I get it\u2026.kind of. But you are not quite getting it. You are upset that your mother is making decisions that may possibly affect your life. However, you are also making decisions that affect her life. \n\nYou are an adult. You should have realized by now that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Unless you are completely supporting your mother\u2014and by extension the infant\u2014you have no say. Just like she can\u2019t make demands on you unless you are completely supported by her. \n\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective. Say you found the cutest puppy on the planet at the shelter. Those big brown eyes looked up at you and you had no choice. Your mother finds out and demands you return the puppy. It will effect your vacations together (now it\u2019s only dog friendly places or when you can board, shopping (now you can\u2019t leave the puppy more than 4 hours), and holidays (the puppy has to come with you!). So even though she doesn\u2019t have to pay for, train, or even babysit the puppy, she demands you return it\u2026\u2026.You would say absolutely not. And rightfully so.\n\nEdit: Typo\u2014there are probably more", "If you are going to have a relationship with someone, no matter of what kind, what they choose might at times affect your life without being part of your life, but you can never make someone else\u2019s choices for them and you shouldn\u2019t be forcing their hands. You are trying to dictate a HUGE part of their lives to make yours very slightly more comfortable.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about you, other people\u2019s actions aren\u2019t about you. How you protect yourself is not by being controlling like you are being, that actively damages other people in big ways, but by learning how to create and enforce boundaries, which are about *your own* actions. You might be successful in other areas, but emotionally you have a long way to go and that makes you incredibly vulnerable to all the things you hate, like addictions and bad choices. Getting out of that cycle is not something that happens because you have money or go to school, otherwise we would have no rich folks and graduates dying from overdoses and going to rehab so often, most of it is emotional work. YTA.", "You're contradicting yourself. You want her to get some interests so she's not on your case all the time, then you freak out about her having someone else in her life and you not being the sole center of the universe anymore.\n\nIt's one or the other.", "You live in such a safe world Im legit jealous", "I know my mom and the rest of my family. so yes while it would be easy to say \"don't ask me\" it would destroy our relationship. (and I want to keep that)", "Op needs to address boundaries then, not try to control other peoples choices.", "She didn't even try to set boundaries. She just strait up became a jerk. \n\nI understand very well what it is to have your family expecting shit of you you don't want to be a part of. You set your boundaries, and if they don't respect it they don't get to be in your life. I am not saying this is easy, it's not, but you can't tell your family what they can and cannot do. Just like they can't tell you what you can and cannot do.", "You are hilariously as equally shallow as OP. Bravo.", "That\u2019s exactly what OP said. They will force OP. I mean, the real issue is OP\u2019s inability to set and keep boundaries. I have no problem saying I won\u2019t help and then not helping. Clearly OP always allows themselves to be pressured into things when it comes to what the family wants.", "Ummm no. Macy\u2019s baby cannot be more important to OP than herself. That is insane. Who told Macy to have yet another baby she can\u2019t/won\u2019t take care of? Did OP tell her to do that? So why should OP prioritize her baby?", "OP seemingly wants mom around when it's convenient for them. And when it's not, well, mom can have some of her own life!", "I live in the United States. Where do you live?", "But you claimed the threat was that you couldn\u2019t go away with them? That\u2019s not a threat in your life. \n\nI\u2019m so confused. My parents never paid for me to go away with them when I was 26 either?", "A relationship is not a relationship if it\u2019s conditional. You might want to think about that.", "Has nothing to do with being shallow. Who wants that in their life? If you\u2019re born into it it\u2019s one thing, but why would you opt into it?", "OP doesn\u2019t need to prioritize jack shit. She is a grown adult that is moved out of the house that the baby will be in.", "same, what i mean is that sometimes i don't feel like risking retaliation and getting justice only AFTER my life is already ruined.", "it would be different if my mom was having her own child.", "What type of retaliation are you talking about?", "What type of retaliation? \n\nHow is your life ruined? Because your parents wouldn\u2019t pay for you, a 26 year old, to go on holiday with them?\n\nYou sound spoilt and bratty.", "Why? \nI don't think i understand why you think you'd beg ok with your mom's biological baby boy not adopting this particular baby"]}
