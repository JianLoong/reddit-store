The baby (along with her 3 other children) were taken away and my great aunt \u201caunt J\u201d took custody of all 4 of them.\n\n*Background: My mom moved to the suburbs of the city I moved to after I graduated. Since my grandma was getting older she decided to sell her large house and moved in with my mom. So it is just us 3 in this state. I have been the youngest in the family until about 5 years ago when my older cousins started having kids. As soon as people started having babies that became everyone\u2019s obsession. The only conversations we had were about potty training or how many blueberries so and so ate. I'm not a kid person and my family claims I don't \u201ccare about the babies\u201d (I was away at college when they were born and couldn't really visit)*\n\nContinued: My grandma makes good money and has supported me and many other family members throughout the years (bought my car when I turned 16, IVF for my cousin, and even bought a home a while ago for aunt J and the rest of her siblings) so when aunt J contacted my grandma for help with Macy's kids, of course, my grandma forked over a ton of money for clothes, food, and Christmas gifts.\n\nI was shopping with my mom recently and she mentioned that Macy is pregnant again!! Aunt J doesn\u2019t know if she will be able to take care of another baby. She said my grandma wanted to take in the baby when it arrives and it could live with my mom and grandma.\n\nI immediately objected. My mom was taken aback because I objected so quickly and tried to guilt me by saying there was nowhere else for the baby to go and if she took it in it would have a great life. I told her I\u2019m not really interested in getting a sibling at 26 and that I\u2019d probably not be as supportive or involved as she\u2019d like. (My mom and I bond over mall shopping, lunch trips, and vacations with each other) I'd probably stop coming around if it meant shlepping around a diaper bag and stroller, I could never see myself babysitting or even hanging out with the child not to mention how embarrassing it would be to tell my friends and future partner I have a random baby \u201csibling\u201d due to a family member that popped pills and her pussy too much.\n\nWe dropped it. But my grandma just left to go back to my home state to visit everyone and their kids for Christmas.\n\nI am nervous that she will commit to taking care of this unborn baby and my life plans as well as my feelings will be ignored.\n\nI meet with my therapist tomorrow and will definitely be talking about this with her, but it is her job to consider my feelings and kind of be on my side so I wanted to get an outsider\u2019s perspective on if I\u2019m the asshole for not wanting to rescue this unborn child that is a result of someone else\u2019s poor decisions.\n\nEdits for clarity: \n\nI live alone in a high-rise apartment all by myself, they live about 40 minutes away in the suburbs \n\nnone of this is about money lmao \n\nsee my longer comment down below but my family is more dependent on one another than the typical family so please take that into consideration before you say \"this doesn't involve you\" you know the saying \"it takes a village?\" it is expected that you will be the village often and if you're not it will (and has) caused arguments. \n\nchill about the date thing, its at the bottom of my worry list and y'all got too fired up about it to understand what I was saying anyway.

I suggest when you go to therapy tomorrow, discuss why you feel so defensive about the baby becoming part of your family. Are you scared you\u2019ll lose the closeness you have with your mother? Or are you just aggravated by babies? Either way, therapy is the best solution. Like others said, you\u2019re 26. You shouldn\u2019t care to this extent what your mother or your grandmother are doing, especially something as kind and thoughtful as taking in a baby who has no better option. If you\u2019re so embarrassed about carrying around a diaper bag that you\u2019re willing to stop visiting your mother who is compassionate enough to take in a whole human who needs her, you need to reevaluate.

She's a grown ass adult and can make that decision for herself. She also doesn't owe you an explanation or have to listen to your opinion. \n\nYour post screams that you are jealous of sharing attention as you had to mention you were the \"baby of the family\" until cousins started having families of their own and now GoD fOrBiD they talk about those moments in their next step of their lives. \n\nI get not being a fan of kids (my husband and I believe in and are happy with our CF lifestyle) but would never tell someone they can't take in a child or have one because WE don't want that for us or think they shouldn't.

You want someone to vindicate that everyone else is the AH if ur gonna he an AH. Macy, your mom, grandma, someone else to have some fault but at the end of the day what they do isn't your business or problem. You would want them to be supportive of your decisions. You should at least respect theirs. Sure macy is a screw up. But the baby is innocent. The kids don't deserve to be punished for existing which is kinda what you are implying. Because they embarrass you or inconvenience you. It's your family. Shouldn't you care? Your family is hyper dependent on each other and stuff. I get it.

Her addiction illness is so powerful though that she can\u2019t overcome it at this point in her life. I\u2019ve got kids and I can\u2019t imagine how painful being apart from her own kids is for her, and this is likely fuelling her addiction as well.

Pretty much every family is going to have a \"black sheep\", I suspect less \"no history of drug addiction\" and more \"someone was/ is an addict, but don't talk about it because it's shameful.\"", "Op already stated it a few times, I don't know why everyone is skipping over it. The mom and grandmother would expect op to take part in caring for the child, usually that means free babysitting. If grandma and mom take in this baby they shouldn't expect any help from op as op has already made it clear they want no part in caring for a child. We've all read posts on this sub, what do you want to bet that they'll take that baby in, op will refuse any chance to babysit, then grandma and mom will be whining about being overwhelmed and not getting a break and not receiving help from someone that didn't sign up to help in the first place. Ops an asshole for trying to demand they not take the baby in. When it comes to ops worries about how much they'll be expected to chip in with the baby those fears are completely warranted.", "because they chose to move here to be close to me and have always expected a village of help when it comes to kids. so basically they are forcing this kid and partial responsibility of raising it onto me", "people like you make the world a dark place.", "Oh no, OP definitely says that in the comments. It\u2019s a pattern with her family. Whatever happens to one happens to all and OP is constantly pressured into doing what the family wants, so will be expected to help regardless of what OP wants.", "Oh damn. You caught me.", "Op said mom, grandma, and him all live in the same state, it's the rest of the family and the cousins that live in a different state(op had moved to get away, then mom and gma followed). While the words \"please watch the baby\" haven't been uttered yet family expecting other family to help out in times like this is quite common and op has already stated/implied a couple times that that's the kind of family they have and that the family has already made comments about op not visiting when the other children were babies.", "are you saying you wouldn't be a bit judgmental towards a woman who delivered a baby with drugs in its system?", "No he's afraid he'll be expected to look after the baby and will be in a no win situation where he doesn't want a child or to take care of one but will be expected to help his mother because \"she's his mother\" and \" family\" and if he refuses then his mother may build up resentment for him however if he caves and helps out he'll probably end up babysitting for free like once a week if not more which is not something he wants to sign up for. Most people usually get upset when it's implied they'll be a free babysitter for someone and if they refuse they'll ruin the relationship they have with that person.", "You are not supposed to do anything. Being family gives you no rights to anyone\u2019s time and etc. The pill popping cousin should stop having kids and making it everyone else\u2019s problem.", "You are already destroying it by telling them not to adopt a bay in need because it wouldn\u2019t be convenient for you.", "I understand OP. They love their ma and grandma and don't want to lose the relationship they have. It's difficult to cut people off, especially if you really care about them. Someone can do that more easily, someone not...\n\nWhile OP can't tell them what they can or cannot do, OP can tell them she will be out if they decide to go on with the baby. For me that's also the fair thing to do, so they don't count on OP's help.\n\nWe don't know if OP tried to set boundaries and they were stomped on. But OP needs to work on that. A lot. It's gonna be difficult and most likely also painful, but it's necessary. Either do the boundaries thingie or be unhappy with the unpleasant life situation.... not easy thing to do. Good luck, OP.", "You can find it hard to believe all you want. I don\u2019t know one person in my family like that. I don\u2019t have one friend like that. Drug addiction is not and has never been a part of my life and I don\u2019t plan to make it.", "We already covered this.", "Just because they moved closer to you under the pretence of a village of help doesn\u2019t mean you actually have to give them any help. Have they actually mentioned you helping to raise this kid or are you just assuming?", "Yes, the commenter saying you need to grow up makes the world a dark place, not the severely entitled 26 year old who doesn't want her mother to take care of a child in need.\n\nJFC", "Uh, same could be said about people like you. Look in the mirror before you say sh*t like this", "Oh and people like YOU moaning about a baby that needs a home even though your an adult make the world what? A light place...no you're just another AH in a world filled with them. Newsflash!!! You're EVERYTHING that is wrong with the world today.", "Yeah I saw the comments she made after I made this. Prolly gonna delete my original comment cause the whole thing sounds like a toxic enmeshment situation that wasn\u2019t started by OP.", "I'm a midwife and I am always compassionate towards women suffering addictions and their babies. Addiction is a disease.", "Two concepts you really need to ask your therapist about are empathy and compassion. I wouldn\u2019t judge, no. If she were a family member I would move heaven and earth to help that poor baby.", "\u201cThreatened me over not going on a trip with them.\u201d\n\nThe threat was because she WOULDN\u2019T go on the trip.", "Because you love someone and aren\u2019t shallow enough to judge them based on the actions of people who aren\u2019t them?", "You probably just aren't aware of it. Statistically, unless you have an extremely small family, there is likely to be at least one person with drug or alcohol problems. You know what? My children would probably be just like you and swear that there's no one in their family that has such issues, but they would be wrong. There have been drug and alcohol problems on my dad's side of the family, but they just aren't part of my life and so it's just not common knowledge. I make an effort to talk about drugs and alcohol with my children, so they are aware that there are some family members who have/ had issues, but they only know that because I have open conversations about that stuff. \n\nYour extremely limited and close minded viewpoint tells me you were probably raised in a family that's very close minded. Which means they are probably exactly the type to keep uncle Bob's little problem under wraps or just never talk about cousin Carol who doesn't exist to them anymore because of her drug problem. \n\nIt's a perfectly reasonable and healthy boundary to not want to have a partner with a drug or alcohol problem. Eliminating anyone who has a family member with such a problem? You're pretty much eliminating your entire dating pool. No one in my close circle has addiction issues, but they all have family members who have struggled or currently struggle. \n\nTry opening your mind. Really talk to the people you're close to. See if they know anyone who struggles with drugs or alcohol. You might be shocked. Of course, if you're part of an extremely religious/ fundamental community, you'll probably be told no, but that's it's own issue.", "Maybe so, but it's more likely that someone somewhere in your family has at least had issues with alcohol or maybe prescription medication or something to that effect. Just because it's not \"traditional\" drug addiction like doing the classic street drugs of abuse doesn't mean it's not a problem. Based on the small picture of your family you have painted it seems that if they did have issues it wouldn't be good for them to talk about it openly in your family. So it's also possible you just don't know about it.", "Op definitely should prioritize op. Everyone should prioritize their own well being in pretty much every circumstance. Ops an asshole for trying to tell the mom not to adopt the baby but op wouldn't be an asshole for just going low contact due to said baby. People don't have to want to be around babies, you're not an asshole for not liking children and choosing not to be around them. Op is allowed to and should prioritize their own feelings because no one else is going to nor should they. The fact that op is prioritizing themselves doesn't make them an asshole. They become an asshole when they ask and expect others to prioritize them over a baby. However a person prioritizing themselves in a situation that they didn't cause is perfectly fine and reasonable thing to do.", "As I\u2019ve said elsewhere she has edited her comment. \n\nAnd as yet is still to elucidate what these threats are.", "So you\u2019re embarrassed that your mother is taking in a baby in need when you are 26, but you wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if she got pregnant and gave birth when you\u2019re 26?", "Nope. Has nothing to do with judging them for others\u2019 actions. It has to do with deciding what you want in and for your own life, which is what everyone does when they\u2019re looking for a partner.", "I think your statistics are coming from a US perspective. You\u2019re generalizing based on that.", "Ha. My family keeps no secrets. Everyone knows everyone\u2019s business. Even when people think something is a secret, everyone else knows.", "I have no issue with OP not taking responsibility for the baby. I agree with you. OP is the asshole for telling the mom not to adopt a baby because she feels she will be left out. OP is a grown adult that is moved out and has no say in other peoples lives", "[deleted]", "Good luck to you though finding that perfect match of someone you actually love and then them having zero family issues. I take it you're not married? It is a bit weird to not let someone you care about be a part of your life because of things outside of their control. Perfect really just doesn't exist. Unless you are more looking to find the person with the perfect family, regardless of whether you actually really love them or not. Still very hard to find, and then that's destined to fail when you're not in it 100% and times get hard. Divorce= problems as well obviously and I hope your next partner after that is as shallow and decides they don't want to be involved with someone who has divorce baggage. I get what you are saying, but in the real world it's not super realistic to try and shield yourself from every little imperfection. That's how people end up alone permanently, standards are set too high."]}
