They are not a normal part of growing up. Getting angry and having emotions is normal, but it sounds like your son needs a better outlet. Maybe instead of berating a professional for doing their job you should listen and ask questions. There are people out there who could help your son if he should need it. You'll never know with the way you shut down everyone (professionals, teachers, heck even other commenters it seems) who offers an opinion that differs from your own.", "YTA  \n\n\nFrequent severe meltdowns are not normal for teenage boys, you really should get that checked out, especially with the violent outburst in form of cursing and hitting objects.", "Eh, I get you and I'm on the fence.  At my kid's otherwise amazing school there is one counselor who is, to be blunt, yeah- a moron.  He and I have had words.  It is baffling when someone in a job like these doesn't seem to get it.  You were maybe verbally harsher than needed and she might honestly be just trying to do a good job.  I'll go NAH with the side note that I basically agree with your opinion.", "YTA\n\nYour son should be talking to a counsellor, he clearly is having problems handling his emotions at the moment. I've taught 11 year olds, if one of them came into my class crying or visibly distressed then I would send them to the counsellor straight away. You say \"because if she knew anything about [11 year old boys], she'd know that it's normal for them to have these meltdowns\", which is true to an extent, but a) the frequency is an important factor, if we're talking twice a year then that's fine but if it's happening multiple times per week then that's worrying and should be addressed by a professional, b) just because something is normal doesn't mean it's healthy, counselling or therapy to help a child learn to manage their emotions better can be very beneficial if the child is struggling to pick up those skills on their own (even if the emotional outbursts are mostly hormone-related).", "YTA. it\u2019s her JOB as a STUDENT counselor to make sure STUDENTS are okay. you\u2019re a prick and clearly stupid as fuck. maybe you need counseling of your own, seeing as how you got so agressive so fast with a woman just doing her damn job.", "YTA - you even seem like you know you are \n\nETA: if you\u2019re so upset about someone who \u2018doesn\u2019t know\u2019 you or your son getting involved, why are you in this sub? \nAs well, encouraging meltdowns is not healthy and a serious sign of being incapable to process emotions healthily. He should not be banging his head on the dash at that age. \n\nI hope the counsellor continues to reach out to him, seems like he really needs it", "YTA\nThis is not normal behaviour for anyone at any age above maybe 3 and even then they should be taught to regulate.", "YTA. She was trying trying to help, and no, it\u2019s not common knowledge to leave a crying kid to cry, especially as a school counselor. You should call and apologize.", "YTA and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal for 11 year olds to have regular crying meltdowns, especially in school. I was a camp counselor for the 11 year old cabin a few years ago and they all seemed way more emotionally mature than that (and I was with these kids 24/7 for a month so I saw them at their best and worst). Maybe your son needs some extra help/therapy for learning how to manage his emotions?", "Counsellor speaks to your son because she's concerned for his welfare and you're critical... YTA\n\nSometimes students like to speak with someone outside because they may not feel comfortable discussing certain issues with their parents. School counsellors deal with this stuff on a regular basis and may be in a better position to find a solution", "Obvious YTA. The counselor is there to support the students. You shouldn\u2019t have talked to her that way, because she was just trying to help. Meltdowns can be normal in some kids, but certainly not in all of them. The counselor has a right to ask about how your son is doing if he has a meltdown in school.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Somehow? \n\nIf they didn't think something was wrong at home before, they most certainly do now. You were angry and combative, so it's only natural for them to feel you're like that with your son.", "Yta- your sons meltdown doesn't sound normal if he was hitting and lashing out.
