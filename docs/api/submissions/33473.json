{"id": 33473, "submission_id": "18njc07", "title": "AITA for not accommodating my vegan friend's dietary preferences at my dinner party?", "selftext": "I (28F) recently hosted a dinner party at my place, and I tried my best to cater to everyone's tastes. However, my friend (29F) is a vegan, and I didn't make any special arrangements for her. I figured she could find something to eat among the other dishes, but she ended up feeling left out.\n\nShe expressed her disappointment, and now some friends are saying I should have been more considerate. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but am I the asshole for not going the extra mile to accommodate her vegan preferences? I just thought there would be enough options for everyone. Thoughts, Reddit? AITA?\n\nEDIT: I want to clarify that there were various salads and meals that could be considered vegan-friendly at the dinner party. However, it seems my friend was upset about the absence of specialized vegan dishes like tofu or fake meat. I appreciate the feedback and will take it into account for future events.\n\nEDIT 2: I realize there might be some confusion about the term \"dinner party\" in my initial post. It wasn't a formal sit-down affair; it was more of a casual get-together where people could help themselves to food from the table. I appreciate the feedback, and I'll make sure to be clearer in my future posts.\n\nEDIT 3: Just to clarify, my other vegan friend at the gathering was totally cool with the food options. It seems I might have misunderstood the preferences of the friend in question. Apologies for any confusion, and I appreciate your understanding.\n\nEDIT 4: I don't know what about EDIT 1 makes people think it was just salads and veggies but ill clarify that we had Rataoullie as well as pastas and noodles that my other vegan friend made sure were vegan before the party. The reason my friend was upset was that all the \"vegan\" food was food that could also be enjoyed by non-vegans, rather than specialized vegan recipies.\n\nHopefully final EDIT 5: Alright I get it guys, I'm not good at hosting lol. I've learned my lesson and will remember this if I ever decide to host again.

If I were your friend and you had known me for many years and all you had were french fries and salad, I\u2019d be pretty bummed too because it would seem you didn\u2019t care about me.

For one event she wanted a meat substitute? \n\nNot everyone is knowledgeable in preparing a special dish such as tofu and from what I have heard is easy to prepare incorrectly making it almost inedible. \n\nMaybe her expectations were not reasonable. It seems we live in a society where people expect everyone else to cater to their every desires. \n\nSometimes instead of adjusting what you do to provide to their level of approval it might be better to just accept this may not be a sustainable friendship. As I have gotten older and reflected on how much I went out of my way to accommodate others and their sense of entitlement I realized for my own positive experiences it would have been better to limit what I was able to do as most times it was simply a power play on their part and not appreciated.", "NTA\n\nYou provided loads of options, if there was something specific this person wanted they could bring it themselves.
