So I asked our waiter if it was possible to be moved to a different table.\n\nWe've been going to this restaurant for years and always sat at this table when we could so he askrd me why we wanted to move (it was more of a joke).

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt's crazy to me that other parents expect folks to put up with their kid's nonsense.", "NTA. You were diplomatic saying \"We'd like to have a conversation...\" rather than \"The crying baby is ruining our dinner!\"\n\n   Wait until you get older, and the host/hostess *purposely* sits you in the Kids Feel Free to Scream Section.

It\u2019s not fair to other diners to bring a crying baby to a restaurant. The parents should understand this. You handled it as diplomatically as you could", "NTA...The fact that the father wasn't apologetic says a lot. This is why babysitters exist.", "NTA, as the parent of an infant, if he fusses or cries for longer than 2 minutes, I\u2019m taking him outside.  No one should have their meal be miserable because of a screaming baby.", "NTA, that was very diplomatic of you.\n\nThe first time we took my daughter to a restaurant we heard someone asking to move tables because of a \"draft\". I have a feeling it was just bc he was worried about her making noise but he wasn't rude at all.", "NTA. I really hate many parents because they act inconsiderate and like horrible people many times and use their kids as an excuse or shield. So many times I have been out to eat and parents even let their kids play on phone or tablet with full volume on. Or when I worked fast food when I was younger parents would literally be eating while letting their kids move tables, chairs and run around the restaurant and even toddlers wandering out the door because they don\u2019t care", "NTA. Something very similar happened to my mother once, where she asked to be moved and the table got upset at her. But it's not like you can't help being out or that there's nothing you can do to stop your kid from annoying other guests: *you can take your kid outside, sit in the car with them.* That's what my parents always did with me when I was really little.\n\nAs someone in the service industry, I'm sure the staff understood, too; they were probably *also* annoyed.", "NTA- you asked to be moved and tried to give as a diplomatic reason as possible. It\u2019s not like you demanded the couple with the baby be removed", "Why would the waiter ask why you wanted to move, if there was a baby continuously crying right next to you?", "NTA. Some restaurants even post a minimum age for kids, like 10. You don\u2019t want to hear a kid cry. Me neither. I have kids too. If ever mine cried or acted up when they were little we removed them and ourselves from the situation so as to not disturb others. The only exception to this rule is airplanes. It sucks if there\u2019s a crying kid, but sometimes on a plane they really can\u2019t be stopped and everyone just has to deal.", "NTA. You are paying for that experience, you should get your money's worth.", "NTA, they're the ones with the crying baby. They should be taking the baby outside or packing up dinner to go.  I don't care if it's McDonald's for a Michelin restaurant, you don't let your kid disturb others.  Obviously, they were more interested in their own dinner (and your conversation) than caring for their distressed infant.", "NTA, why did they bring a kid into a restaurant? It's bound to be full of people and have some lvl of noice. Of course the kiddo was throwiny a fit, they were uncomfortable. Parents are morons here. Not only did they spoil the night for themselves, they did so for other guests.\n\nYou had every right to be comfortable while paying your money.  The ones being rude and insensitive are the parents.\n\nI get bringing a kid to a public place when needed and noone would judge parents for their crying toddler in the hospital or smth, but bringing them into a restaurant, which is not specifically kid friendly while 5 months all is rude to the other people and cruel to the kid", "NTA. I was sitting at a bar and a woman with a child came in and sat next to me, so I moved. She took offense even though I said nothing. There's a reason I like to sit at the bar to eat, and not having to sit next to children is one of them.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say bc this baby is crying non stop, the father knew he was wrong here and that's' why he responded the way he did", "NTA\n\nIf it's a sophisticated restaurant and it's an evening meal you are quite right to want a calm, relaxing, grown up experience. I wouldn't want a crying baby next to me either.

He should have ben apologetic but he was boldly disrespectful.  His stupid statement didnt even warrant a response from you.  Your request to sit elsewhere was rooted in logic.  You came to a restaurant to enjoy the atmosphere and have a pleasant meal with your wife.  And that is more important than the thoughts of a tone deaf stranger without the decency to take a crying baby out of a restaurant much less the forethought to bring a baby into what you explain as \"a rather sophisticated restaurant\" in the first place.  NTA", "NTA. Good lord. They should have gotten their food to go once they realized that calming the kid down wasn\u2019t working. You didn\u2019t even ask to have THEM reseated, you asked for a new table for yourselves. IDK how you could\u2019ve been nicer about sticking up for your own peaceful experience.", "NTA- Nature designed that sound to be so horrendous you can't ignore it no matter how tired or whatever else you may be. So no, you shouldn't have to sit right next to it and it's fine to politely give them their space, ahem, just as you did. Oh and the waiter wanted them to hear it because he couldn't call them TAs.", "I\u2019ve done this too. It sucks to pay $60 for a babysitter so you can go out for an evening meal somewhere nice without a toddler screaming at you\u2026 and then get seated next to someone else\u2019s screaming toddler. NTA", "Nta you didn't yell at them our ask the manager to kick them out.  I don't want to listen to a baby cry while I'm out at a nice resturant.   If they don't want to have a sitter then those parents need to get their food to go.", "NTA people don\u2019t use common sense anymore. Same scenario happened to my parents when they were new parents going out for their first post-baby meal, except no one had to ask to move because as soon as baby started crying, mom picked her up to go outside and dad called for the check once she signaled that it wasn\u2019t temporary. I know this story because my mom pointedly told that now grown up baby about it when she was considering her own first post baby restaurant visit.", "NTA- You didn't involve yourself in their parenting, just asked to move away. The husband is definitely TA.", "NTA\n\nThe majority of the world is open for kids. A quiet, fancy restaurant isn't the place for a newborn.", "NTA\n\nReasonable request, reasonable motivation. Dad was being defensive.", "As a parent to 2 kids myself, if we have to take the kids with us we go to a family friendly restaurant. If we want to go to a nicer place, we leave the kids at home. We also go to a nicer place BECAUSE we don't want kids around.\n\nDon't get me wrong - if the kids are well behaved and quiet, I wouldn't care but I'm not spending $$$ for a meal to hear a baby crying.\n\nNTA", "Nope. If it is a nice restaurant honestly the restaurant should have talked to the couple. Yes kids cry but you are also paying for a nice dinner out and shouldn't have to listen to their child screaming the entire time. They are the ones being rude and insensitive to others. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "You're NTA. Just because they're in love with the sound of their baby's voice doesn't mean everyone else has to be too.", "NTA, but the other guests sure were. My husband and I have eight kids and never tolerated screaming in restaurants. Certainly not tolerating someone else\u2019s screaming kid!", "NTA. If our son cries at a restaurant, one of us IMMEDIATELY brings him outside until he settles. No one else's dining experience should be disrupted. They're the rude ones.", "NTA. You can move to another table if you want to, forget them. They brought a very young crying baby in there, they should\u2019ve expected that lol", "NTA. We all have a societal duty to keep the status quo of the environment we're in. And as you well know, that means parents need to temporarily remove children from quiet places when those kids can't be quiet. These parents BROKE social norms by continuing to sit there while their kid cried. You have ever right and reason to try and recoup the environment you were paying to enjoy. \n\nI am all for bringing kids to restaurants! Heck, my 3 yo eats out with us at least weekly and has since he was 4 days old. But we ALWAYS step out if he's crying or otherwise being unsuitable for the environment. That's our responsibility as members of a society.", "NTA \n\nThey shouldn't have brought the baby there. They should be home in a safe place, cuddling their child and letting it enjoy it's own crib. \n\nYour request was reasonable. You didn't openly blame them, either. So NA for that.", "NTA so many people would ask the family with the baby to move. You didn't bother them. You can sit anywhere you want. I think your response was very sensitive considering. The parents were rude.", "NTA the rude option would be to ask to have them moved.", "NTA If the father of the crying baby doesn't like people moving away from him and his family then maybe they should leave their kid with a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a scene, you just asked to move. That causes zero harm to the couple or the baby.", "NTA. If your kid aren\u2019t old enough to be able to sit and not scream then it\u2019s not old enough to be in the restaurant, unless of course you are willing to get up and go outside to quit down the kid instead of letting it ruin everyone else\u2019s meal.\n\nNot blaming the kid. Babies and toddlers don\u2019t know better, they can\u2019t be blamed.", "NTA. People like that couple are just plain rude. Over a decade ago, my husband and I went to IHOP with our youngest daughter at the time. She was screaming after we had ordered our food. (Didn't know at the time she had a genetic disorder that would cause this behavior during the regression). As my husband ordered Eggs Benedict and I ordered a hamburger, I had my order put in a to-go box and ate in the car with her while my husband ate his eggs in the restaurant. My daughter in her 20's now still has moments like these and I have never hesitated to remove her from the area so as not to disturb others. NTA.", "NTA. When my husband and I go on dates, we prefer to have the ability to hear each other because my husband is nearly deaf in 1 ear and the other ear is getting nearly as bad so even at home when it's quiet he still has trouble hearing me half the time and it's aggravating having to almost yell at him just for him to hear me. It's hard to have an intimate convo in public places when kids are around especially in restaurants where you can't move because you are afraid of being an AH like your situation. So I definitely sympathize with you. Parents should understand that not everyone is ok with spending their date nights around crying babies. \n\nNote: before people start jumping on me on that last one, I don't mind kids in certain situations and places but at least understand and not call people an AH just for wanting to have a relaxing date night with your spouse/SO. We can understand that you just want to bring your kids out of the house which is fine. Just don't harp on people who want to move to a different area to have some peace and quiet.", "Changed to soft YTA based on OP's obliviousness in intentionally calling out the couple's child where they could hear it.\n\nOriginal:\n\nN T A but were you oblivious that the couple could hear you?

One can have empathy but also be incredibly frustrated, because why can't the parents help teach soothing techniques or just drive instead of ear-screwing an entire plane of 100 plus people for hours.

She just took the child and left.", "The weird part is referring to a to-go container as a \"doggy bag\" (which is honestly tacky to say these days anyway, just imo) in a high-class restaurant, speaking to someone in a foreign country where English is not the primary language, and who can't be expected to know that a doggy-bag (ie bag for a doggy) means they'd like a box to take their food home to enjoy later. Without knowing the slang meaning, it could be super insulting! Imagine being a chef and hearing a patron just asked for a bag to take their food home to their dog.", "ok so it seems like more of a language thing than a Michelin starred restaurant thing", "Asking for a container for leftovers is also not something that's done in France, nor is it likely that they will have such containers on hand. Doubly so at a Michelin-starred or otherwise high-end restaurant", "NTA. No one wants to listen to a crying kid. Especially not in a nice restaurant.", "NTA!!! A RESTAURANT IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE INFANTS/ BABIES! I am so passionate about this subject and I will die on this hill. If I'm going to a restaurant (not fast food) I'm expecting and paying for a certain experience and in no way does it include any child noises, period. I don't wanna hear them laugh, cry, scream, talk. I don't wanna hear their iPad, I don't wanna hear their FaceTime call with their other stupid friend. I don't wanna hear their whining about not getting food they like. I don't wanna go into the restroom and have some brat crawling around on the floor. And I swear, the next person I see change a diaper on a table, I'm going to make them eat it. \n\nThis also goes for pubs, breweries, distilleries, wineries, basically anywhere that is inherently marketed to the adult demographic! Keep your fucking kids in the McDonalds Play Area FFS!\n\nNot yelling at you, OP. This is just very specifically why we don't go out anymore.", "Absolutely NTA.", "I don't mind kids at restaurants bc I understand kids are learning. But infants that's different poor baby prolly was colic or uncomfortable.  \nBut no you are NTA. you are allowed to want a different table", "NTA. Nobody goes to a sophisticated restaurant to listen to babies wailing. If you want to take your little noisebox out for dinner, either go to somewhere that\u2019s aimed at the young-family market or take the child outside when it starts squawking.", "You're NTA for wanting to move. The waiter is the AH.\n\nYou seem perfectly reasonable. I have no idea if you could have voiced your rationale to the waiter more discreetly or not. Your post doesn't make it clear how discreet you were. The waiter is the AH for asking you when it was obvious and they could have asked you after you had moved if they really wanted to. \n\nThe husband shouldn't have called you rude/ insensitive. However, I suspect he was just stressed and flustered in that moment. Let's give him grace for that. \n\nI'm actually shocked by some of the comments about the parents of the infant which seem kinda AH-y to me. Parents can bring a baby out to a public place. Maybe it was their first time out? Maybe they have no family close by? Maybe they didn't feel comfortable finding someone else (a stranger essentially) to look after their young infant, their most precious thing in the world (we wouldn't have)? Does that mean they should just hunker down and stay in? No. Does that mean they can't go out to a nice place? No. Does it mean they should eat at a different time to everyone else? No. I would strongly suspect they're well aware how they may be affecting other diners. It's stressful enough as it is having a crying baby. Imagine how shamed/ embarrassed/ *insert other word here* they would feel overhearing him. I'm sure they were trying their best. All babies cry. Doesn't mean they shouldn't be out in public. Have a heart. They're sleep deprived, trying to find some semblance of normal and do something nice. I can only assume the people commenting don't have children or are far removed from the baby stage and gave forgotten what it's like. Going out for a meal was probably a big achievement for that couple.", "Sounds like the waiter wished he could be moved away from the child, too. NTA", "NTA\nHow could you possibly be? By the parents\u2019 reasoning everybody has a right to a nice meal there. You\u2019re not asking *them* to move or inconvenience themselves. Entitled parents at their finest!!!

If I want to hear kids going off, I'll go to Chucky Cheese, or even an Olive Garden.", "I hate parents like this, the mentality that just cause I have had a kid, my life won't change, selfish, the kid gets nothing out of this, and others can't enjoy their meal, so no you were not in the wrong, especially as it's a fancy place. I would feel the same way, also for anyone coming for me, I do have kids, and knew that once they were born, my life has to change, and taking them to a restaurant was not something I would do, I would pay a babysitter to look after them if going out.", "NTA. \n\nMost diners are parents looking to escape parenthood and reconnect as adults. \n\nMany can be tolerant of how close to reality they let their experiences be. \n\nThat sucks", "NTA\n\nAs long as you didn't make a scene.... You are 100% well within your rights to move when someone in the restaurant is being super loud. When your kid is freaking out.... You pack up your shit and leave. I've done it... It's the right thing to do. Sitting there and making everyone else listen to your screaming kid is a giant ah move.", "NTA. You politely asked the waiter for a different table. You did nothing wrong. One parent should've taken the baby out and tried to soothe them etc. Is this not standard behaviour for when a baby is brought to a public spot and it starts crying. That's what my parents did if we cried.", "NTA", "NTA.", "You\u2019re clearly not British! Yeah NTA there was no way to move without embarrassing the couple so you were in a lose-lose situation.", "NTA, but the server should has kept his mouth shut and just discreetly moved you.  The other couple should have also had some manners and taken the baby outside.", "NTA\n\nWhat would have been rude was asking THEM to move. You asked nothing of them and just wanted to remove yourself from a situation you weren't comfortable with", "NTA", "NTA. The manager should have comped the meal and had the kitchen prepare to go boxes. She/He could have suggested to the parents that,since the baby was so distressed, it would be understandable they should leave to take the baby home to comfort it. Here is your meal,no charge, hope you enjoy it, Bye.", "INFO it really seems like you could have easily communicated with your waiter without the other couple hearing you... if you wanted to.", "I would be so mortified if I were that couple. If I did that (I wouldn't), I'd ask to have the food boxed up and get a check posthaste, and tip like no tomorrow.", "> I bet they bring the baby to movies too. - there's nothing wrong with bringing a baby\n\nBringing a baby to a restaurant won't hurt it, but bringing a baby to a movie theater can! The sound is too loud and can damage their hearing.", "Ooooh, I didn't think of that! Yeah, to be fair, any server worth their salt would be like, \"I gotchu,\" and dry their best to make shit happen. \n\nTo be fair, maybe the server was a bit overwhelmed and realized too little too late. \n\nINFO: OP. did you get a discount of any kind? Sometimes that's where the discreet apology is...", "THIS! If my toddler is throwing a fit and I am unable to calm him down in five minutes, we take a walk outside. We did the same thing when he was a baby.", "That is insane. How did no one complain?? Those parents should have been kicked out (either for the entire show or until the child quieted down outside), it isn't acceptable to be disruptive at an opera.", "I didn't mean it's okay to take them to a theater. I know thats bad. But, restaurants, museums and such is okay to try. I shoulda put a clarifier in there. My \" - \" was meant to separate it. But it is random... so, yeah. Lol. Sorry for the confusion.", "If you are the cause of a problem, and you hear about it, you should be upset with yourself. Not the person you disturbed.", "> carry them out\n\n\nFor a millisecond my brain tried to complete the saying but the mental imagine of the way to hell being paved with crying babies was not a good one lol", "Take the brat outside. Yes we understand kids cry. That doesn't mean we want to listen to it. Sounds like they need a baby sitter until the child is older or stay home.", "My great niece was about four when my dad died. She had a meltdown before the service, and her parents weren't doing anything to stop it, so I picked her up and sat with her on a bench outside. I told her that she doesn't get to be inside with everyone until she stopped and I told her if she did it again we'd sit outside longer. She didn't make a peep the entire afternoon.", "The flip side to that is if you take them out (of a store, restaurants have a higher standard) every time they start crying or playing up they very quickly learn how to get their own way. At some point they have to learn that boring things need to happen.", "OP is one hundred percent nta for wanting to move tables and have a nice dinner with their wife. However, babies are allowed to be in public places. Yes, crying can be annoying sometimes. But parents are still allowed to have nights out and not everyone can afford childcare.

OP was very rude.", "Fuuuuuuuuuuck that shit.\n\nI get how hard it is to travel with a toddler. I've done it several times and will continue to do it because it's our only way of being able to see family. But I am prepared beyond belief. Snacks are ready to go. Kids sized headphones. Reusable stickers. Pop-its. Toys. Games. Books.  \n\nThe only time my toddler cries on the airplane is when his ears dont pop, which is understandable as its painful. But even then, we are on it and trying our best to get him calm.", "There's environments where bringing a kid is plain disrespectful to other costumers tho; an upscale restaurant with couples having a dating night is where people who sometimes saved to be able to afford the food/babysitter go so to bring a newborn is basically ruin the night for everybody around - same with restaurants with live music, movies with age restriction... there's plenty of more family oriented restaurants where they could enjoy the night while also bringing the kid.", ">A 14 year old kid doesn't need dozens of grown people calling him an asshole. Back off.\n\nWTF are you talking about???", "Maybe you're on the wrong post, since there's no 14 year old here.
