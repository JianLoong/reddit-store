So I asked our waiter if it was possible to be moved to a different table.\n\nWe've been going to this restaurant for years and always sat at this table when we could so he askrd me why we wanted to move (it was more of a joke).

You were diplomatic saying \"We'd like to have a conversation...\" rather than \"The crying baby is ruining our dinner!\"\n\n   Wait until you get older, and the host/hostess *purposely* sits you in the Kids Feel Free to Scream Section.

No one should have their meal be miserable because of a screaming baby.", "NTA, that was very diplomatic of you.\n\nThe first time we took my daughter to a restaurant we heard someone asking to move tables because of a \"draft\". I have a feeling it was just bc he was worried about her making noise but he wasn't rude at all.", "NTA. I really hate many parents because they act inconsiderate and like horrible people many times and use their kids as an excuse or shield. So many times I have been out to eat and parents even let their kids play on phone or tablet with full volume on.

Some restaurants even post a minimum age for kids, like 10. You don\u2019t want to hear a kid cry. Me neither. I have kids too. If ever mine cried or acted up when they were little we removed them and ourselves from the situation so as to not disturb others. The only exception to this rule is airplanes.

It's bound to be full of people and have some lvl of noice. Of course the kiddo was throwiny a fit, they were uncomfortable. Parents are morons here. Not only did they spoil the night for themselves, they did so for other guests.\n\nYou had every right to be comfortable while paying your money.  The ones being rude and insensitive are the parents.\n\nI get bringing a kid to a public place when needed and noone would judge parents for their crying toddler in the hospital or smth, but bringing them into a restaurant, which is not specifically kid friendly while 5 months all is rude to the other people and cruel to the kid", "NTA. I was sitting at a bar and a woman with a child came in and sat next to me, so I moved. She took offense even though I said nothing. There's a reason I like to sit at the bar to eat, and not having to sit next to children is one of them.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say bc this baby is crying non stop, the father knew he was wrong here and that's' why he responded the way he did", "NTA\n\nIf it's a sophisticated restaurant and it's an evening meal you are quite right to want a calm, relaxing, grown up experience. I wouldn't want a crying baby next to me either.

He should have ben apologetic but he was boldly disrespectful.  His stupid statement didnt even warrant a response from you.  Your request to sit elsewhere was rooted in logic.  You came to a restaurant to enjoy the atmosphere and have a pleasant meal with your wife.  And that is more important than the thoughts of a tone deaf stranger without the decency to take a crying baby out of a restaurant much less the forethought to bring a baby into what you explain as \"a rather sophisticated restaurant\" in the first place.  NTA", "NTA. Good lord. They should have gotten their food to go once they realized that calming the kid down wasn\u2019t working.

So no, you shouldn't have to sit right next to it and it's fine to politely give them their space, ahem, just as you did. Oh and the waiter wanted them to hear it because he couldn't call them TAs.", "I\u2019ve done this too.

NTA", "Nta you didn't yell at them our ask the manager to kick them out.  I don't want to listen to a baby cry while I'm out at a nice resturant.   If they don't want to have a sitter then those parents need to get their food to go.", "NTA people don\u2019t use common sense anymore. Same scenario happened to my parents when they were new parents going out for their first post-baby meal, except no one had to ask to move because as soon as baby started crying, mom picked her up to go outside and dad called for the check once she signaled that it wasn\u2019t temporary. I know this story because my mom pointedly told that now grown up baby about it when she was considering her own first post baby restaurant visit.", "NTA- You didn't involve yourself in their parenting, just asked to move away. The husband is definitely TA.", "NTA\n\nThe majority of the world is open for kids. A quiet, fancy restaurant isn't the place for a newborn.", "NTA\n\nReasonable request, reasonable motivation. Dad was being defensive.", "As a parent to 2 kids myself, if we have to take the kids with us we go to a family friendly restaurant. If we want to go to a nicer place, we leave the kids at home. We also go to a nicer place BECAUSE we don't want kids around.\n\nDon't get me wrong - if the kids are well behaved and quiet, I wouldn't care but I'm not spending $$$ for a meal to hear a baby crying.\n\nNTA", "Nope. If it is a nice restaurant honestly the restaurant should have talked to the couple. Yes kids cry but you are also paying for a nice dinner out and shouldn't have to listen to their child screaming the entire time. They are the ones being rude and insensitive to others. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "You're NTA. Just because they're in love with the sound of their baby's voice doesn't mean everyone else has to be too.", "NTA, but the other guests sure were. My husband and I have eight kids and never tolerated screaming in restaurants. Certainly not tolerating someone else\u2019s screaming kid!", "NTA. If our son cries at a restaurant, one of us IMMEDIATELY brings him outside until he settles. No one else's dining experience should be disrupted. They're the rude ones.", "NTA. You can move to another table if you want to, forget them. They brought a very young crying baby in there, they should\u2019ve expected that lol", "NTA. We all have a societal duty to keep the status quo of the environment we're in. And as you well know, that means parents need to temporarily remove children from quiet places when those kids can't be quiet. These parents BROKE social norms by continuing to sit there while their kid cried. You have ever right and reason to try and recoup the environment you were paying to enjoy. \n\nI am all for bringing kids to restaurants! Heck, my 3 yo eats out with us at least weekly and has since he was 4 days old. But we ALWAYS step out if he's crying or otherwise being unsuitable for the environment. That's our responsibility as members of a society.", "NTA \n\nThey shouldn't have brought the baby there. They should be home in a safe place, cuddling their child and letting it enjoy it's own crib. \n\nYour request was reasonable. You didn't openly blame them, either. So NA for that.", "NTA so many people would ask the family with the baby to move. You didn't bother them. You can sit anywhere you want. I think your response was very sensitive considering. The parents were rude.", "NTA the rude option would be to ask to have them moved.", "NTA If the father of the crying baby doesn't like people moving away from him and his family then maybe they should leave their kid with a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a scene, you just asked to move. That causes zero harm to the couple or the baby.", "NTA. If your kid aren\u2019t old enough to be able to sit and not scream then it\u2019s not old enough to be in the restaurant, unless of course you are willing to get up and go outside to quit down the kid instead of letting it ruin everyone else\u2019s meal.\n\nNot blaming the kid. Babies and toddlers don\u2019t know better, they can\u2019t be blamed.", "NTA. People like that couple are just plain rude. Over a decade ago, my husband and I went to IHOP with our youngest daughter at the time. She was screaming after we had ordered our food. (Didn't know at the time she had a genetic disorder that would cause this behavior during the regression). As my husband ordered Eggs Benedict and I ordered a hamburger, I had my order put in a to-go box and ate in the car with her while my husband ate his eggs in the restaurant. My daughter in her 20's now still has moments like these and I have never hesitated to remove her from the area so as not to disturb others. NTA.", "NTA. When my husband and I go on dates, we prefer to have the ability to hear each other because my husband is nearly deaf in 1 ear and the other ear is getting nearly as bad so even at home when it's quiet he still has trouble hearing me half the time and it's aggravating having to almost yell at him just for him to hear me. It's hard to have an intimate convo in public places when kids are around especially in restaurants where you can't move because you are afraid of being an AH like your situation. So I definitely sympathize with you. Parents should understand that not everyone is ok with spending their date nights around crying babies. \n\nNote: before people start jumping on me on that last one, I don't mind kids in certain situations and places but at least understand and not call people an AH just for wanting to have a relaxing date night with your spouse/SO. We can understand that you just want to bring your kids out of the house which is fine. Just don't harp on people who want to move to a different area to have some peace and quiet.", "Changed to soft YTA based on OP's obliviousness in intentionally calling out the couple's child where they could hear it.\n\nOriginal:\n\nN T A but were you oblivious that the couple could hear you?

You didn't ask them to move or shut it up.", "NTA - In my opinion, infants and young children do not belong in a sophisticated restaurants.  When my kid was younger, Chucky Cheese Pizza Time Theater was our regular hangout until she was old enough to not be yelling, running around, etc.  Then we were able to go out and enjoy something a bit more upscale.\n\nI think the husband was rude and insensitive to think an entire restaurant would somehow enjoy his screaming child.", "NTA, if your kid cries, go ahead and move outside or get your stuff to go if you can't console them within a reasonable time.  I mean kids need to learn how to behave when out, but we're talking about an infant...at a fancy restaurant, most people aren't that bad of an ahole lol....I mean I certainly just did the neighborhood places and would go to the car if it continued past a few mins of crying.  Normally nursing would work to soothe an infant.  \n\nYou were at a restaurant where you had the luxury of moving to a different table, so nta.   Some people just have aversions to screaming/crying babies, I'm one of them, and I have a high tolerance, but when it passes into over 10 mins, I start getting super irritated and annoyed.\n\nI was on a flight recently, there were two kids shrieking, the one was a few rows ahead, and sounded/looked to be about 14-16 months maybe, and the crying/fussing continued for the entire boarding/takeoff -total about 45 mins...not an infant, probably that stupid lazy parent that can't bother to try and soothe their kid.  \n\nThen there was a kid about 5-6 yrs old a few seats back, that by the sounds she made, wasn't normal crying but an odd loud yell continous loud sounds, and likely had a disability or autism of a significant degree....this went on for about 2 hrs, during people deboarding the faces and mumbling comments started.  One can have empathy but also be incredibly frustrated, because why can't the parents help teach soothing techniques or just drive instead of ear-screwing an entire plane of 100 plus people for hours.   Then my empathy would kick in and think, poor parents, at least I can get off the plane and go home and not deal with it, when that is their lifetime burden.  Just because it's mean to think this way, doesn't mean we aren't also human and triggered greatly by super annoying sounds.   I had ear plugs, a cozymask with sounds on as well and it was still torture.\n\nI love my husband, but his snoring makes me have some very dark thoughts after nights of sleep deprivation.  It's just reality.  Annoying sounds are a form of torture.\n\nI LOVE dogs and continued barking dogs get on my nerves, even my own, if they keep at it I bring them indoors for a time out, they aren't really 'all the time' barkers either.", "NTA. I\u2019m on the spectrum and I\u2019m sensitive to sound. If I was in your situation I would have done the same thing. And if the dad called me an AH he\u2019d be completely in the wrong. At a younger age that crying baby would\u2019ve completely overwhelmed me and sent me into a meltdown. It wasn\u2019t something I could control so how would not being able to cope make me an AH? But regardless of age if I found myself unable to cope, I\u2019d remove myself from the situation. I wouldn\u2019t ask the other party to keep down the noise. That\u2019s exactly what you did.", "op=NTA\n\nIt is not rude to ask the waiter to move.  It would have been rude to say something to the parents(like: *shut your brat up*).  \n\nYou have every right to a decent \"date night\" with your wife where you can actually HEAR what she has to say.    \nMind you, if you are eating at Chucky Cheese or McDonald's Expect noisy children <wink>", "NTA. They were being rude. This isn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s.", "NTA.  I raised 3 kids.  I did my time at Chuck E. Cheese.  If I'm going out for a romantic night out, I don't want to hear someone's kids misbehaving.  I love the idea of adults only restaurants.", "NTA", "NTA, there\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t make \u2018sounds of screaming children\u2019 albums to play in places like spas and restaurants, and that\u2019s because people generally don\u2019t find it a relaxing soundtrack", "NTA.", "NTA, there shouldn't be anything wrong with you wanting to move. It's unfortunate but it seems to be something people do, I went to a wine bar for the first time a couple of weeks ago and after 30mins it basically became a creche.", "NTA. the guy telling you you\u2019re being insensitive is TA for not just stfu and realizing people deserve a nice night out without kids crying.", "NTA - babies don't bother me personally, but yes, in a public setting like that, you have an obligation not to be disruptive to the other people dining there as well. The couple should have just gotten it to go, and not bothered commenting at all.", "NTA. I hate parents that think they are more important because they have a child. They think everyone should accommodate them.", "NTA \nI don't blame you. I would have done the same thing.", "NTA.  I've asked waiters to move me when next to a party with small kids more than once.  It's not even rude that the parents heard you.  You don't have to tolerate their little one crying if there are other tables available.", "NTA, I don\u2019t understand how what you did could be considered rude. It\u2019s not like you asked for them to be moved.", "NTA.  When our kids were babies, and even now when our younger one is 4, I found myself wanting to have distance between myself and their crying.  You didn't even inconvenience them or make any remarks to them.", "I don't get people. I felt bad bringing my daughter when she was 3 months to Olive Garden. She started crying me and spouse switched off who went off to rock and console. It is a restaurant you are paying to relax, talk at a normal volume and eat not listen to a cry/screaming or other wise unhappy kid. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Mom with two kids, one who was pretty difficult at restaurants. We waited until he could talk, took him outside when he got loud, and did a lot of takeout. You didn't even involve them. They're being ridiculous. If you can afford a nice restaurant, you can afford a sitter.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve probably glared at them and made nasty comments to their faces. My soul is a bottomless pit where empathy cannot be found even if you scrape the sides", "NTA I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole for wanting kids to shut up in public spaces.", "NTA but nobody cares whether you had the luxury of not taking your kids places", "Yta for saying sophisticated restaurant, what does that mean", "Or go to a more \"family friendly\" restaurant if you must go out and can't get a sitter.\n\nNobody should take someone else not wanting to pay to sit by your screaming baby as a personal insult. Maybe instead of going out with the baby, the couple should have hired a sitter, and then just gone to bed and got some rest.\n\nThe biggest AH, though, was the waiter who forced OP to spell out exactly  why he wanted to move, when it was deafeningly obvious to anyone in the building. One would expect a waiter at a better restaurant to be more discreet.", "Definitely NTA, I could see you being rude if you asked for them to be moved or asked to leave or something that disturbs them, or if you had made rude comments about them out loud like the very valid but still kinda mean point that a very young infant shouldn\u2019t be brought to a nice restaurant. But you didn\u2019t you tried to remove yourselves from the situation. You reacted appropriately.", "This is why husband and I sit at the bar of the restaurant.  Same food, good service, no kids.", "Perfectly said! The guy felt attacked because he knew it was his baby causing disruption and  tried to shift the blame on OP. Coward", "It would probably be considered discrimination to turn away a family from a restaurant because they brought their baby", "It means a high end, expensive place. Usually with a place like that there\u2019s like, a code of practice. A kid that goes into those types of places is usually old enough to behave and understand, but an infant that cries usually doesn\u2019t do well in those places.", "Never fly\n\nEdit to add: JOKE (because Reddit does not get jokes)", "Awh, you sound very sweet. I\u2019m going to preface this by saying I love my mom and I personally couldn\u2019t have asked for a better upbringing but the woman never minced words about the fact she \u201cloves me more than anything in the world\u201d but she \u201chates everyone else\u2019s damn kids.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 She\u2019s getting older and while her filter was never great (or even good), it\u2019s entirely gone now. \n\nThe last time we went to dinner together, the hostess tried to seat us near a gaggle of young children and my mom\u2019s immediate reaction was: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m old. I want to enjoy the time I have left and I don\u2019t have the patience to be this close to that many kids.\u201d No toys in that lady\u2019s handbag, that\u2019s for sure.", "Nope, they just think old people are all hard of hearing and won't notice the kids crying...", "I think you would find that all the tables are reserved.", "Ahhh, that's true. I live in Florida. Forgot that's an issue elsewhere. \ud83d\ude2c", "He was clearly trying to show their parents their kid was causing discomfort to other guests. Which was passive aggressive of him, yeah, would I like a child screaming in my ear while working? NO.", "If a parent can't control their children they shouldn't be upset if people don't want to deal with the behavior of their child.", "One that they probably know by name too seeing as they've been going and sitting at the same table for 15 years lmao.", "Especially during the cold/flu/whooping cough/pneumonia/Covid season! How irresponsible!"]}
