I had reserved our usual table at a rather sophisticated restaurant. We've been going there for a very long time (ever since we started dating which was 15 years ago) and I've never seen anyone bring very young kids there.\n\nAnyway, the couple at the table right beside ours had brought their kid, who was just a few months old. The child would NOT stop crying. They would try to comfort her but it lasted just a few minutes and the kid went off on another crying fit. \n\nOnce our food arrived, it only got worse. I was there to have a relaxing one-on-one conversation with my wife and it was impossible under those circumstances. I thought we could sit at another table. So I asked our waiter if it was possible to be moved to a different table.\n\nWe've been going to this restaurant for years and always sat at this table when we could so he askrd me why we wanted to move (it was more of a joke). I said we wanted some space to have a conversation together and it was too loud here. The couple heard my answer and the husband said that I was being rude and insensitive.\n\nNow have two kids (8M and 6F). I know the stress of being parents but we never brought kids that young there. We went out much less and when we did we got babysitters then just as we do now.\n\nI just said I preferred to sit somewhere else and didn't understand their comments. \nWas it an AH move?

They should've gotten a babysitter or something.", "I have a high tolerance for kids in public places, but the parents are clearly assholes here. NTA.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form.  The dad was the rude and insensitive one.", "Nta. I bet they bring the baby to movies too. - there's nothing wrong with bringing a baby, but if it's in a setting (like a high end restaurant) that people can reasonably expect to ... oh, idk... hold a conversation and not need to yell over a crying baby... mom n dad should remove the baby. If the baby won't stop crying, disrupting others meals, then they should leave. --- I am a mom. Baby's cry. But that doesn't give me the right to disregard the people around me. If you were at McDonald's, and wanted to move tables, it's still justified. Don't worry about butt hurt dad. He'll get over himself (hopefully). You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt's crazy to me that other parents expect folks to put up with their kid's nonsense.", "NTA. You were diplomatic saying \"We'd like to have a conversation...\" rather than \"The crying baby is ruining our dinner!\"\n\n   Wait until you get older, and the host/hostess *purposely* sits you in the Kids Feel Free to Scream Section. (I guess they think if you're old enough to be grandparents, you're fine with that.) When this happens, I'll ask for something closer to the door, near the middle, etc!", "NTA. It\u2019s not fair to other diners to bring a crying baby to a restaurant. The parents should understand this. You handled it as diplomatically as you could", "NTA...The fact that the father wasn't apologetic says a lot. This is why babysitters exist.", "NTA, as the parent of an infant, if he fusses or cries for longer than 2 minutes, I\u2019m taking him outside.  No one should have their meal be miserable because of a screaming baby.", "NTA, that was very diplomatic of you.\n\nThe first time we took my daughter to a restaurant we heard someone asking to move tables because of a \"draft\". I have a feeling it was just bc he was worried about her making noise but he wasn't rude at all.", "NTA. I really hate many parents because they act inconsiderate and like horrible people many times and use their kids as an excuse or shield. So many times I have been out to eat and parents even let their kids play on phone or tablet with full volume on. Or when I worked fast food when I was younger parents would literally be eating while letting their kids move tables, chairs and run around the restaurant and even toddlers wandering out the door because they don\u2019t care", "NTA. Something very similar happened to my mother once, where she asked to be moved and the table got upset at her. But it's not like you can't help being out or that there's nothing you can do to stop your kid from annoying other guests: *you can take your kid outside, sit in the car with them.* That's what my parents always did with me when I was really little.\n\nAs someone in the service industry, I'm sure the staff understood, too; they were probably *also* annoyed.", "NTA- you asked to be moved and tried to give as a diplomatic reason as possible. It\u2019s not like you demanded the couple with the baby be removed", "Why would the waiter ask why you wanted to move, if there was a baby continuously crying right next to you?", "NTA. Some restaurants even post a minimum age for kids, like 10. You don\u2019t want to hear a kid cry. Me neither. I have kids too. If ever mine cried or acted up when they were little we removed them and ourselves from the situation so as to not disturb others. The only exception to this rule is airplanes. It sucks if there\u2019s a crying kid, but sometimes on a plane they really can\u2019t be stopped and everyone just has to deal.", "NTA. You are paying for that experience, you should get your money's worth.", "NTA, they're the ones with the crying baby. They should be taking the baby outside or packing up dinner to go.  I don't care if it's McDonald's for a Michelin restaurant, you don't let your kid disturb others.  Obviously, they were more interested in their own dinner (and your conversation) than caring for their distressed infant.", "NTA, why did they bring a kid into a restaurant? It's bound to be full of people and have some lvl of noice. Of course the kiddo was throwiny a fit, they were uncomfortable. Parents are morons here. Not only did they spoil the night for themselves, they did so for other guests.\n\nYou had every right to be comfortable while paying your money.  The ones being rude and insensitive are the parents.\n\nI get bringing a kid to a public place when needed and noone would judge parents for their crying toddler in the hospital or smth, but bringing them into a restaurant, which is not specifically kid friendly while 5 months all is rude to the other people and cruel to the kid", "NTA. I was sitting at a bar and a woman with a child came in and sat next to me, so I moved. She took offense even though I said nothing. There's a reason I like to sit at the bar to eat, and not having to sit next to children is one of them.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say bc this baby is crying non stop, the father knew he was wrong here and that's' why he responded the way he did", "NTA\n\nIf it's a sophisticated restaurant and it's an evening meal you are quite right to want a calm, relaxing, grown up experience. I wouldn't want a crying baby next to me either. I especially wouldn't want to by *paying* to sit through it!", "What surprises me is how a \"rather sophisticated restaurant\" let them in at all.\n\nParents with babies behaving selfishly no longer surprises me. It just depresses and appals me.\n\nOh, NTA of course.", ">The couple heard my answer and the husband said that I was being rude and insensitive.\n\nThe husband was full of shit and he knew it.  it was his ego talking and deflecting blame; it was the only weapon he had.\n\nAnyway, who cares what he thought?  He should have ben apologetic but he was boldly disrespectful.  His stupid statement didnt even warrant a response from you.  Your request to sit elsewhere was rooted in logic.  You came to a restaurant to enjoy the atmosphere and have a pleasant meal with your wife.  And that is more important than the thoughts of a tone deaf stranger without the decency to take a crying baby out of a restaurant much less the forethought to bring a baby into what you explain as \"a rather sophisticated restaurant\" in the first place.  NTA", "NTA. Good lord. They should have gotten their food to go once they realized that calming the kid down wasn\u2019t working. You didn\u2019t even ask to have THEM reseated, you asked for a new table for yourselves. IDK how you could\u2019ve been nicer about sticking up for your own peaceful experience.", "NTA- Nature designed that sound to be so horrendous you can't ignore it no matter how tired or whatever else you may be. So no, you shouldn't have to sit right next to it and it's fine to politely give them their space, ahem, just as you did. Oh and the waiter wanted them to hear it because he couldn't call them TAs.", "I\u2019ve done this too. It sucks to pay $60 for a babysitter so you can go out for an evening meal somewhere nice without a toddler screaming at you\u2026 and then get seated next to someone else\u2019s screaming toddler. NTA", "Nta you didn't yell at them our ask the manager to kick them out.  I don't want to listen to a baby cry while I'm out at a nice resturant.   If they don't want to have a sitter then those parents need to get their food to go.", "NTA people don\u2019t use common sense anymore. Same scenario happened to my parents when they were new parents going out for their first post-baby meal, except no one had to ask to move because as soon as baby started crying, mom picked her up to go outside and dad called for the check once she signaled that it wasn\u2019t temporary. I know this story because my mom pointedly told that now grown up baby about it when she was considering her own first post baby restaurant visit.", "NTA- You didn't involve yourself in their parenting, just asked to move away. The husband is definitely TA.", "NTA\n\nThe majority of the world is open for kids. A quiet, fancy restaurant isn't the place for a newborn.", "NTA\n\nReasonable request, reasonable motivation. Dad was being defensive.", "As a parent to 2 kids myself, if we have to take the kids with us we go to a family friendly restaurant. If we want to go to a nicer place, we leave the kids at home. We also go to a nicer place BECAUSE we don't want kids around.\n\nDon't get me wrong - if the kids are well behaved and quiet, I wouldn't care but I'm not spending $$$ for a meal to hear a baby crying.\n\nNTA", "Nope. If it is a nice restaurant honestly the restaurant should have talked to the couple. Yes kids cry but you are also paying for a nice dinner out and shouldn't have to listen to their child screaming the entire time. They are the ones being rude and insensitive to others. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "You're NTA. Just because they're in love with the sound of their baby's voice doesn't mean everyone else has to be too.", "NTA, but the other guests sure were. My husband and I have eight kids and never tolerated screaming in restaurants. Certainly not tolerating someone else\u2019s screaming kid!", "NTA. If our son cries at a restaurant, one of us IMMEDIATELY brings him outside until he settles. No one else's dining experience should be disrupted. They're the rude ones.", "NTA. You can move to another table if you want to, forget them. They brought a very young crying baby in there, they should\u2019ve expected that lol", "NTA. We all have a societal duty to keep the status quo of the environment we're in. And as you well know, that means parents need to temporarily remove children from quiet places when those kids can't be quiet. These parents BROKE social norms by continuing to sit there while their kid cried. You have ever right and reason to try and recoup the environment you were paying to enjoy. \n\nI am all for bringing kids to restaurants! Heck, my 3 yo eats out with us at least weekly and has since he was 4 days old. But we ALWAYS step out if he's crying or otherwise being unsuitable for the environment. That's our responsibility as members of a society.", "NTA \n\nThey shouldn't have brought the baby there. They should be home in a safe place, cuddling their child and letting it enjoy it's own crib. \n\nYour request was reasonable. You didn't openly blame them, either. So NA for that.", "NTA so many people would ask the family with the baby to move. You didn't bother them. You can sit anywhere you want. I think your response was very sensitive considering. The parents were rude.", "NTA the rude option would be to ask to have them moved.", "NTA If the father of the crying baby doesn't like people moving away from him and his family then maybe they should leave their kid with a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make a scene, you just asked to move. That causes zero harm to the couple or the baby.", "NTA. If your kid aren\u2019t old enough to be able to sit and not scream then it\u2019s not old enough to be in the restaurant, unless of course you are willing to get up and go outside to quit down the kid instead of letting it ruin everyone else\u2019s meal.\n\nNot blaming the kid. Babies and toddlers don\u2019t know better, they can\u2019t be blamed.", "NTA. People like that couple are just plain rude. Over a decade ago, my husband and I went to IHOP with our youngest daughter at the time. She was screaming after we had ordered our food. (Didn't know at the time she had a genetic disorder that would cause this behavior during the regression). As my husband ordered Eggs Benedict and I ordered a hamburger, I had my order put in a to-go box and ate in the car with her while my husband ate his eggs in the restaurant. My daughter in her 20's now still has moments like these and I have never hesitated to remove her from the area so as not to disturb others. NTA.", "NTA. When my husband and I go on dates, we prefer to have the ability to hear each other because my husband is nearly deaf in 1 ear and the other ear is getting nearly as bad so even at home when it's quiet he still has trouble hearing me half the time and it's aggravating having to almost yell at him just for him to hear me. It's hard to have an intimate convo in public places when kids are around especially in restaurants where you can't move because you are afraid of being an AH like your situation. So I definitely sympathize with you. Parents should understand that not everyone is ok with spending their date nights around crying babies. \n\nNote: before people start jumping on me on that last one, I don't mind kids in certain situations and places but at least understand and not call people an AH just for wanting to have a relaxing date night with your spouse/SO. We can understand that you just want to bring your kids out of the house which is fine. Just don't harp on people who want to move to a different area to have some peace and quiet.", "Changed to soft YTA based on OP's obliviousness in intentionally calling out the couple's child where they could hear it.\n\nOriginal:\n\nN T A but were you oblivious that the couple could hear you?
