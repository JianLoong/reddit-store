You should have the privilege of being the first to live there. Period.", "NTA. I can see why they'd want to and even expect it, but they need to respect your decision. That being said... I would just let them stay in the house. Unless your house was just built, it has probably had other people living in it, anyway. I don't understand the hangup. Your parents very likely housed you for many years. But, y'know, it's your place, so just choose wisely.", "YTA. Your parents are going to have to pay for accommodation even though there's going to be a completely unused empty house there? It's just a little bit over sentimental in my opinion.

I see others saying your house your rules, which is true but still shitty and selfish.", "YTA. At the end of the day, it's your house so you can do what you want with it but your reasoning is selfish and honestly pretty stupid.

Your house is yours....if they planned the trip years ago, they should have counted accommodation into it. Well done on standing your ground - of course they won't like it, but you can't control how others feel.", "NTA, where were the planning on staying before you bought the house?", "Will the house have any furniture or utilities?  Honestly I would be more concerned about that and it would have been my argument. Since you haven\u2019t moved in yet I would assume the house is not ready to have anyone stay there, least not guests. \n\nAlso what if something is wrong with the house/they break something?  How would you even reasonably know (things can get past inspection). \n\nYour parents asked and you said no, that should be it. NTA.", "A gentle YTA.  This kind of \"first\" is really silly - lots of other people have seen the house before you.  Your patently presumably housed you for many years.  Why let it sit empty when they could stay?\n\nYou and your wife could choose to see it as house-sitting, keeping the house safe before you move in.", "Tbh, I think that YTA in this situation.\nThey're asking to stay in your empty home. That YOU chose without your wife even setting eyes on it, yet suddenly its so super important that noone dare set foot in it before her?!\nIf you wish to set the tone of the rest of your parental relationship based on this, go ahead. But remember, this will cost you nothing but kindness, repaying no doubt the multitude of things they have done for you and the sacrifices they have made for you a thousand times over. And may well change your relationship forever. Really worth that when you're clearly moving so far away?\n\nNot to mention surely it's preferable for the home to be occupied and not vacant that whole time. As well as if like the UK this would invalidate insurances.", "YTA \n\nThis is a stupid reason to make your parents shell out more money.

Your house doesn't revolve around their trip.", "NTA. Parents are being entitled", "NTA, it's your house", " NTA at all. I don't think the wanting to be the first to stay in your house should even be the focus here. You won't be moved in, so I'm assuming it will be unfurnished. Will the power even be on? This doesn't sound likely to be visitor friendly at all.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally I would have let my parents stay there. I wouldn't really care about being the first one to stay in the house. It would definitely be nice of you to let them stay there, but at the end of the day it's your house so you can decide. And they should respect your choice.", "The logistics won't work anyway - OP moving into house in July, so house would be empty of furniture and other essentials in June.", "I think the sort of people who would accept the \"nope\" are also the sort of people who you would let stay. \n\nThat said, having someone stay in the house before the homeowners have moved in would be odd.\n\nLike, is it furnished? Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water? \n\nThere are so many little things that go into getting a house ready for occupancy and that need to be redone when leaving that even someone who is very comfortable with people staying in their home would not be comfortable with them staying in a home unsupervised.\n\n\nIf it's the slightest bit rural it's a whole nother level of planning.\n\nNTA", "The parents aren\u2019t accepting OP\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 and at 26 this is the first time he\u2019s said \u2018No\u2019 to them.

Once it's actually a home, that's when they should visit.", "Nope, NTA OP.  Your parents can ask, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t say no.", "NTA, this is entirely reasonable. If your parents want a free place to stay they can delay their trip or come again down the line.\n\nAs someone who lives in a destination for travel, how smyoubset boundaries now matters. People can and will demand your home constantly, and often without warning, if you allow that. Don't.", "NTA. I feel sorry for your parents, I understand that it's really hard to afford a rent somewhere else...

It\u2019s not like the house would get worse. I\u2019d never ask my parents to pay for a holiday home if I have one they could use. That seems unnecessarily petty and not how family would act in my opinion.", "NAH but if they are struggling financially it would be the nice thing to do..", "YTA. Why not, it costs nothing to be kind to them. Assuming you have a good relationship with your parents. Also, your only 26, there\u2019s probably going to be times in your life ahead where you will still need them and should want that relationship to be strong.", "YTA", "It would cost you nothing, there would be somebody there to have an eye on the house etc.\n\nIf there\u2019s no actual reason like your parents being hoarders or living in filth you definitely are YTA.", "I mean you're NTA but saying your parents can't stay in the house is not standing up to them. You said no because you value your experience of seeing the house first more than helping your parents save money on a trip.\n\nMy parents planned a trip to Tokyo and just assumed they'd stay with me. They rang up and said they're coming on these dates and that was it. But that's the kind of family I want to be in, other families prefer distance between themselves.", "NTA", "Oh, I thought you'd heard. In July 2023 Alaska is due to fall into the ocean and be forever lost alongside Atlantis.", "How is that reasonable it just sounds petty", "I agree with this.

In fact, I would have been the one to offer up the suggestion to my parents in the first place. YTA agreed.", "Can\u2019t believe how long i had to scroll down to see this comment. Presumably they had a good parent/child relationship and up bringing. \n\nEver since becoming a parent, I understand what it means to give everything you have to your children. My parents have done so much for me. Don\u2019t care if it\u2019s their job or whatever. I would not even blink at this kind of request.

Go ahead and stay!\u201d Knowing full well there\u2019s no furniture, food, likely no utilities active. My parents are NOT petty enough to buy furniture, groceries, and then ask me to pay them back, so YMMV.", "Somehow I feel like it'll be like \"Surprise! With the money we saved by staying in your house, we bought you some furniture you'll really love!\" Or maybe I just spend too much time on reddit", "Oh wow  you'd think that'd make international news. /s \n\nOp is NTA.", ">Like, is it furnished? Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water?\n\nGood reason to have mom and dad do a test run.

Ridiculous that they assume they\u2019d be able to stay in your house you and your wife have yet to live in.", "NTA. a similar thing happened to my sister. she'd moved to a new apartment with her husband (first time either of them lived together btw) but before they could even stay the night he was rushed to the ER. he had to stay overnight for a few days and my sister was by his side the whole time (he had a private room with a sofa bed), but his mom, who lived an hour away, insisted on also staying closeby while he recovered... so while he was in the hospital she made herself at home. she slept on their bed, used their appliances and lived in their apartment before they could do it themselves (without asking first). my sister is still bitter about it.\n\nmaybe in the future, if you two are away for a few days for holidays, your parents can housesit for you, but asking to essentially live in your house before you've moved in would also be a big no-no for me.", "Won't call you an asshole for it, but to be honest these AITAs where someone has to be the first to blah, blah, blah are kind of tiresome. I mean it's your house, do what you want with it, but I don't think it's a particularly good reason.\n\nI mean, if you just didn't like your parents, that's a good reason. But all this stuff like \"I want to stay it in first\" is just sort of lame, TBH.", "Absolutely NTA, you're not even getting settled into your place yet, but they want to be the *first* to be there?

You don't have a house til July. Where EXACTLY are they staying? Also, if you can not afford vacation, for the love of God don't go and make everyone miserable with what you can't do on this magical trip from hell.", "NTA\n\nBut seriously, you really need to be the first to stay in the house?", "YTA gently, \n\nOnly for the fact of \u201cwhat did you expect them to hope for\u201d.

Your right not to let them stay. Also a crappy thing to do if you can help your parents out and choose not to over something small like that. I would have said sure no problem, but I like my parents.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but it does seem selfish. Also just kinda weird right like.. it\u2019s just a house and they\u2019re family.

NO MATTER WHAT, NONE of you will be \u201cfirst.\u201d And why not show your wife some pictures before your parents go? As a matter of fact, i am shocked you did not show her photos already and insist on her approval. I know buying a first home is a big thing, but to not let your parents stay because of some hang up you have?

You can help your parents, but you have some weird ego thing about needing to christen the house with your presence first.\n\nYou might get a lot of NTA because of the individualistic nature of western cultures, but that's not how healthy families think.", "NTA they can wait or postpone the trip till you are there and settles and have agreed to host them, otherwise tough shit.", "Because the post is fake?", "Exactly. You would never know what condition was there before your parents and what happened during their stay. It's super important to check the house by yourself before everything else.", "Yeah, I don't really understand the reasoning. They bought the house.
