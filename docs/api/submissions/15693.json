It's really not a difficult concept to grasp!", "Your house your rules.  If you say no then no it is.  Also why are they planning a month long trip if they can\u2019t afford it?\n\nETA NTA   Sorry forgot to render judgement", "NTA. They could always travel to Alaska at a later time? When you\u2019re more settled in. I mean, it has been two years. A few months is not that much longer in the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s not like the state or mountains are going anywhere", "NTA. They\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, well before you got the job and bought the house, so they have to have planned where they were going to stay and how they were going to pay for it. You\u2019re under no obligation to let them stay in your house\u2014explain that it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re not comfortable with them staying there before you move in. End of discussion.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems very reasonable for the owner of the house to want to be the first ones to see and live in their new house. \n\nIt\u2019s strange your parents feel entitled to put their feelings first.", "Info: if they\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, where we\u2019re they planning to stay?? You didn\u2019t even live in Alaska at that time?", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to set healthy boundaries and wanting to keep your home your own is healthy in my opinion. They should respect that.", "NTA, I get it. Your first home is a big deal, your house your rules.", "NTA It's your and your wife's house. You should have the privilege of being the first to live there. Period.", "NTA. I can see why they'd want to and even expect it, but they need to respect your decision. That being said... I would just let them stay in the house. Unless your house was just built, it has probably had other people living in it, anyway. I don't understand the hangup. Your parents very likely housed you for many years. But, y'know, it's your place, so just choose wisely.", "YTA. Your parents are going to have to pay for accommodation even though there's going to be a completely unused empty house there? It's just a little bit over sentimental in my opinion. Your wife is going to see it and it has been seen by other people first? Who cares. I would let them stay. I see others saying your house your rules, which is true but still shitty and selfish.", "YTA. At the end of the day, it's your house so you can do what you want with it but your reasoning is selfish and honestly pretty stupid. It would literally not inconvenience you in the slightest but it would be a huge favor for your parents. All because you want to be the first to see it? Yeah, you're an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
