It's really not a difficult concept to grasp!", "Your house your rules.  If you say no then no it is.  Also why are they planning a month long trip if they can\u2019t afford it?\n\nETA NTA   Sorry forgot to render judgement", "NTA. They could always travel to Alaska at a later time? When you\u2019re more settled in. I mean, it has been two years. A few months is not that much longer in the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s not like the state or mountains are going anywhere", "NTA. They\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, well before you got the job and bought the house, so they have to have planned where they were going to stay and how they were going to pay for it. You\u2019re under no obligation to let them stay in your house\u2014explain that it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re not comfortable with them staying there before you move in. End of discussion.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems very reasonable for the owner of the house to want to be the first ones to see and live in their new house. \n\nIt\u2019s strange your parents feel entitled to put their feelings first.", "Info: if they\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, where we\u2019re they planning to stay?? You didn\u2019t even live in Alaska at that time?", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to set healthy boundaries and wanting to keep your home your own is healthy in my opinion. They should respect that.", "NTA, I get it. Your first home is a big deal, your house your rules.", "NTA It's your and your wife's house. You should have the privilege of being the first to live there. Period.", "NTA. I can see why they'd want to and even expect it, but they need to respect your decision. That being said... I would just let them stay in the house. Unless your house was just built, it has probably had other people living in it, anyway. I don't understand the hangup. Your parents very likely housed you for many years. But, y'know, it's your place, so just choose wisely.", "YTA. Your parents are going to have to pay for accommodation even though there's going to be a completely unused empty house there? It's just a little bit over sentimental in my opinion. Your wife is going to see it and it has been seen by other people first? Who cares. I would let them stay. I see others saying your house your rules, which is true but still shitty and selfish.", "YTA. At the end of the day, it's your house so you can do what you want with it but your reasoning is selfish and honestly pretty stupid. It would literally not inconvenience you in the slightest but it would be a huge favor for your parents. All because you want to be the first to see it? Yeah, you're an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I'd want to be the first one to stay in my new house too. \n\nMy brother has spent a lot of time in Alaska so I know things are expensive up there. If they really need to \" ease the cost of there trip\" can they actually afford it at all?", "Are they going to help with payments? If not then no.", "NTA you bought a house, not a hotel to put people up in. I can't even imagine hearing my loved one bought a house and just immediately moving myself in. WTF.", "NTA. Your house is yours....if they planned the trip years ago, they should have counted accommodation into it. Well done on standing your ground - of course they won't like it, but you can't control how others feel.", "NTA, where were the planning on staying before you bought the house?", "Will the house have any furniture or utilities?  Honestly I would be more concerned about that and it would have been my argument. Since you haven\u2019t moved in yet I would assume the house is not ready to have anyone stay there, least not guests. \n\nAlso what if something is wrong with the house/they break something?  How would you even reasonably know (things can get past inspection). \n\nYour parents asked and you said no, that should be it. NTA.", "A gentle YTA.  This kind of \"first\" is really silly - lots of other people have seen the house before you.  Your patently presumably housed you for many years.  Why let it sit empty when they could stay?\n\nYou and your wife could choose to see it as house-sitting, keeping the house safe before you move in.", "Tbh, I think that YTA in this situation.\nThey're asking to stay in your empty home. That YOU chose without your wife even setting eyes on it, yet suddenly its so super important that noone dare set foot in it before her?!\nIf you wish to set the tone of the rest of your parental relationship based on this, go ahead. But remember, this will cost you nothing but kindness, repaying no doubt the multitude of things they have done for you and the sacrifices they have made for you a thousand times over. And may well change your relationship forever. Really worth that when you're clearly moving so far away?\n\nNot to mention surely it's preferable for the home to be occupied and not vacant that whole time. As well as if like the UK this would invalidate insurances.", "YTA \n\nThis is a stupid reason to make your parents shell out more money. Spend a night at the house before they get there then you get to be the first.", "NTA\n\nNot only is it your first house,, but you haven't moved in yet.   Your house doesn't revolve around their trip.", "NTA. Parents are being entitled", "NTA, it's your house", " NTA at all. I don't think the wanting to be the first to stay in your house should even be the focus here. You won't be moved in, so I'm assuming it will be unfurnished. Will the power even be on? This doesn't sound likely to be visitor friendly at all.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally I would have let my parents stay there. I wouldn't really care about being the first one to stay in the house. It would definitely be nice of you to let them stay there, but at the end of the day it's your house so you can decide. And they should respect your choice.", "The logistics won't work anyway - OP moving into house in July, so house would be empty of furniture and other essentials in June.", "I think the sort of people who would accept the \"nope\" are also the sort of people who you would let stay. \n\nThat said, having someone stay in the house before the homeowners have moved in would be odd.\n\nLike, is it furnished? Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water? \n\nThere are so many little things that go into getting a house ready for occupancy and that need to be redone when leaving that even someone who is very comfortable with people staying in their home would not be comfortable with them staying in a home unsupervised.\n\n\nIf it's the slightest bit rural it's a whole nother level of planning.\n\nNTA", "The parents aren\u2019t accepting OP\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 and at 26 this is the first time he\u2019s said \u2018No\u2019 to them. This is an attempted power move on their part. OP is NTA but needs to start polishing his spine when it comes to his parents.", "Yup and it sounds like the parents just don\u2019t get that", "NTA, but also, Alaska is huge. Like highway stretches with barely anything for hours. Wouldn't they have to change itineraries?", "NTA.\n\nYou won't even have settled into the home by the point they come to visit. Once it's actually a home, that's when they should visit.", "Nope, NTA OP.  Your parents can ask, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t say no.", "NTA, this is entirely reasonable. If your parents want a free place to stay they can delay their trip or come again down the line.\n\nAs someone who lives in a destination for travel, how smyoubset boundaries now matters. People can and will demand your home constantly, and often without warning, if you allow that. Don't.", "NTA. I feel sorry for your parents, I understand that it's really hard to afford a rent somewhere else... But I understand you and your wife, that house is going to be your home and it's perfectly understandable that you want to be the first to live there.", "I\u2019d say YTA because they\u2019re family, they raised you, presumably didn\u2019t kick you out and you literally wouldn\u2019t notice they stayed there if they clean up before they leave. It\u2019s not like the house would get worse. I\u2019d never ask my parents to pay for a holiday home if I have one they could use. That seems unnecessarily petty and not how family would act in my opinion.", "NAH but if they are struggling financially it would be the nice thing to do..", "YTA. Why not, it costs nothing to be kind to them. Assuming you have a good relationship with your parents. Also, your only 26, there\u2019s probably going to be times in your life ahead where you will still need them and should want that relationship to be strong.", "YTA", "It would cost you nothing, there would be somebody there to have an eye on the house etc.\n\nIf there\u2019s no actual reason like your parents being hoarders or living in filth you definitely are YTA.", "I mean you're NTA but saying your parents can't stay in the house is not standing up to them. You said no because you value your experience of seeing the house first more than helping your parents save money on a trip.\n\nMy parents planned a trip to Tokyo and just assumed they'd stay with me. They rang up and said they're coming on these dates and that was it. But that's the kind of family I want to be in, other families prefer distance between themselves.", "NTA", "Oh, I thought you'd heard. In July 2023 Alaska is due to fall into the ocean and be forever lost alongside Atlantis.", "How is that reasonable it just sounds petty", "I agree with this. There is no real damage if they stay and OP would be helping people, what is wrong with that? The reason OP is giving is kind of arbitrary.", "For real, i don\u2019t know why people are saying he\u2019s nta here lmao, like it\u2019s your parents you\u2019ve lived with them for so long and you can\u2019t even let them stay in a empty home", "Helping would cause zero inconvenience so i am confused", "This is exactly my thought. In fact, I would have been the one to offer up the suggestion to my parents in the first place. YTA agreed.", "Can\u2019t believe how long i had to scroll down to see this comment. Presumably they had a good parent/child relationship and up bringing. \n\nEver since becoming a parent, I understand what it means to give everything you have to your children. My parents have done so much for me. Don\u2019t care if it\u2019s their job or whatever. I would not even blink at this kind of request. In fact, I would prob use the opportunity of them being there to get things set up. Order stuff I need/want.", "My petty ass would say \u201csure! Go ahead and stay!\u201d Knowing full well there\u2019s no furniture, food, likely no utilities active. My parents are NOT petty enough to buy furniture, groceries, and then ask me to pay them back, so YMMV.", "Somehow I feel like it'll be like \"Surprise! With the money we saved by staying in your house, we bought you some furniture you'll really love!\" Or maybe I just spend too much time on reddit", "Oh wow  you'd think that'd make international news. /s \n\nOp is NTA.", ">Like, is it furnished? Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water?\n\nGood reason to have mom and dad do a test run. Let them make sure all the little details are right before you get in there lol.\n\nBut for real, I think either way is an acceptable answer. No assholes here unless OP's parents dont respect OP's decision", "Absolutely, as soon as they mentioned the trip I\u2019d be like \u201coh we\u2019ve got a free house for you\u201d.", "Lol, more likely to say pay us back for the furniture we brought you! \ud83d\ude02"]}
