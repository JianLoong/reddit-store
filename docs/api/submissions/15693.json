It's really not a difficult concept to grasp!", "Your house your rules.  If you say no then no it is.  Also why are they planning a month long trip if they can\u2019t afford it?\n\nETA NTA   Sorry forgot to render judgement", "NTA. They could always travel to Alaska at a later time? When you\u2019re more settled in. I mean, it has been two years. A few months is not that much longer in the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s not like the state or mountains are going anywhere", "NTA. They\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, well before you got the job and bought the house, so they have to have planned where they were going to stay and how they were going to pay for it. You\u2019re under no obligation to let them stay in your house\u2014explain that it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re not comfortable with them staying there before you move in. End of discussion.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems very reasonable for the owner of the house to want to be the first ones to see and live in their new house. \n\nIt\u2019s strange your parents feel entitled to put their feelings first.", "Info: if they\u2019ve been planning this trip for two years, where we\u2019re they planning to stay?? You didn\u2019t even live in Alaska at that time?", "NTA. It\u2019s ok to set healthy boundaries and wanting to keep your home your own is healthy in my opinion. They should respect that.", "NTA, I get it. Your first home is a big deal, your house your rules.", "NTA It's your and your wife's house. You should have the privilege of being the first to live there. Period.", "NTA. I can see why they'd want to and even expect it, but they need to respect your decision. That being said... I would just let them stay in the house. Unless your house was just built, it has probably had other people living in it, anyway. I don't understand the hangup. Your parents very likely housed you for many years. But, y'know, it's your place, so just choose wisely.", "YTA. Your parents are going to have to pay for accommodation even though there's going to be a completely unused empty house there? It's just a little bit over sentimental in my opinion. Your wife is going to see it and it has been seen by other people first? Who cares. I would let them stay. I see others saying your house your rules, which is true but still shitty and selfish.", "YTA. At the end of the day, it's your house so you can do what you want with it but your reasoning is selfish and honestly pretty stupid. It would literally not inconvenience you in the slightest but it would be a huge favor for your parents. All because you want to be the first to see it? Yeah, you're an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I'd want to be the first one to stay in my new house too. \n\nMy brother has spent a lot of time in Alaska so I know things are expensive up there. If they really need to \" ease the cost of there trip\" can they actually afford it at all?", "Are they going to help with payments? If not then no.", "NTA you bought a house, not a hotel to put people up in. I can't even imagine hearing my loved one bought a house and just immediately moving myself in. WTF.", "NTA. Your house is yours....if they planned the trip years ago, they should have counted accommodation into it. Well done on standing your ground - of course they won't like it, but you can't control how others feel.", "NTA, where were the planning on staying before you bought the house?", "Will the house have any furniture or utilities?  Honestly I would be more concerned about that and it would have been my argument. Since you haven\u2019t moved in yet I would assume the house is not ready to have anyone stay there, least not guests. \n\nAlso what if something is wrong with the house/they break something?  How would you even reasonably know (things can get past inspection). \n\nYour parents asked and you said no, that should be it. NTA.", "A gentle YTA.  This kind of \"first\" is really silly - lots of other people have seen the house before you.  Your patently presumably housed you for many years.  Why let it sit empty when they could stay?\n\nYou and your wife could choose to see it as house-sitting, keeping the house safe before you move in.", "Tbh, I think that YTA in this situation.\nThey're asking to stay in your empty home. That YOU chose without your wife even setting eyes on it, yet suddenly its so super important that noone dare set foot in it before her?!\nIf you wish to set the tone of the rest of your parental relationship based on this, go ahead. But remember, this will cost you nothing but kindness, repaying no doubt the multitude of things they have done for you and the sacrifices they have made for you a thousand times over. And may well change your relationship forever. Really worth that when you're clearly moving so far away?\n\nNot to mention surely it's preferable for the home to be occupied and not vacant that whole time. As well as if like the UK this would invalidate insurances.", "YTA \n\nThis is a stupid reason to make your parents shell out more money. Spend a night at the house before they get there then you get to be the first.", "NTA\n\nNot only is it your first house,, but you haven't moved in yet.   Your house doesn't revolve around their trip.", "NTA. Parents are being entitled", "NTA, it's your house", " NTA at all. I don't think the wanting to be the first to stay in your house should even be the focus here. You won't be moved in, so I'm assuming it will be unfurnished. Will the power even be on? This doesn't sound likely to be visitor friendly at all.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally I would have let my parents stay there. I wouldn't really care about being the first one to stay in the house. It would definitely be nice of you to let them stay there, but at the end of the day it's your house so you can decide. And they should respect your choice.", "The logistics won't work anyway - OP moving into house in July, so house would be empty of furniture and other essentials in June.", "I think the sort of people who would accept the \"nope\" are also the sort of people who you would let stay. \n\nThat said, having someone stay in the house before the homeowners have moved in would be odd.\n\nLike, is it furnished? Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water? \n\nThere are so many little things that go into getting a house ready for occupancy and that need to be redone when leaving that even someone who is very comfortable with people staying in their home would not be comfortable with them staying in a home unsupervised.\n\n\nIf it's the slightest bit rural it's a whole nother level of planning.\n\nNTA", "The parents aren\u2019t accepting OP\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 and at 26 this is the first time he\u2019s said \u2018No\u2019 to them. This is an attempted power move on their part. OP is NTA but needs to start polishing his spine when it comes to his parents.", "Yup and it sounds like the parents just don\u2019t get that"]}
