You should have the privilege of being the first to live there. Period.", "NTA. I can see why they'd want to and even expect it, but they need to respect your decision. That being said... I would just let them stay in the house. Unless your house was just built, it has probably had other people living in it, anyway. I don't understand the hangup. Your parents very likely housed you for many years. But, y'know, it's your place, so just choose wisely.", "YTA. Your parents are going to have to pay for accommodation even though there's going to be a completely unused empty house there? It's just a little bit over sentimental in my opinion.

Your house is yours....if they planned the trip years ago, they should have counted accommodation into it.

Honestly I would be more concerned about that and it would have been my argument. Since you haven\u2019t moved in yet I would assume the house is not ready to have anyone stay there, least not guests. \n\nAlso what if something is wrong with the house/they break something?  How would you even reasonably know (things can get past inspection). \n\nYour parents asked and you said no, that should be it. NTA.", "A gentle YTA.  This kind of \"first\" is really silly - lots of other people have seen the house before you.  Your patently presumably housed you for many years.  Why let it sit empty when they could stay?\n\nYou and your wife could choose to see it as house-sitting, keeping the house safe before you move in.", "Tbh, I think that YTA in this situation.\nThey're asking to stay in your empty home. That YOU chose without your wife even setting eyes on it, yet suddenly its so super important that noone dare set foot in it before her?!\nIf you wish to set the tone of the rest of your parental relationship based on this, go ahead. But remember, this will cost you nothing but kindness, repaying no doubt the multitude of things they have done for you and the sacrifices they have made for you a thousand times over. And may well change your relationship forever. Really worth that when you're clearly moving so far away?\n\nNot to mention surely it's preferable for the home to be occupied and not vacant that whole time. As well as if like the UK this would invalidate insurances.", "YTA \n\nThis is a stupid reason to make your parents shell out more money.

Your house doesn't revolve around their trip.", "NTA. Parents are being entitled", "NTA, it's your house", " NTA at all.

Is the kitchen set up? Water turned on? Would they know how to use the heat and turn it off properly afterwards? Internet? Hot water? \n\nThere are so many little things that go into getting a house ready for occupancy and that need to be redone when leaving that even someone who is very comfortable with people staying in their home would not be comfortable with them staying in a home unsupervised.\n\n\nIf it's the slightest bit rural it's a whole nother level of planning.\n\nNTA", "The parents aren\u2019t accepting OP\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 and at 26 this is the first time he\u2019s said \u2018No\u2019 to them.

If your parents want a free place to stay they can delay their trip or come again down the line.\n\nAs someone who lives in a destination for travel, how smyoubset boundaries now matters.

I feel sorry for your parents, I understand that it's really hard to afford a rent somewhere else...

It\u2019s not like the house would get worse. I\u2019d never ask my parents to pay for a holiday home if I have one they could use. That seems unnecessarily petty and not how family would act in my opinion.", "NAH but if they are struggling financially it would be the nice thing to do..", "YTA. Why not, it costs nothing to be kind to them. Assuming you have a good relationship with your parents. Also, your only 26, there\u2019s probably going to be times in your life ahead where you will still need them and should want that relationship to be strong.", "YTA", "It would cost you nothing, there would be somebody there to have an eye on the house etc.\n\nIf there\u2019s no actual reason like your parents being hoarders or living in filth you definitely are YTA.", "I mean you're NTA but saying your parents can't stay in the house is not standing up to them.

With the money we saved by staying in your house, we bought you some furniture you'll really love!\" Or maybe I just spend too much time on reddit", "Oh wow  you'd think that'd make international news. /s \n\nOp is NTA.", ">Like, is it furnished?

As a matter of fact, i am shocked you did not show her photos already and insist on her approval.

You would never know what condition was there before your parents and what happened during their stay. It's super important to check the house by yourself before everything else.", "Yeah, I don't really understand the reasoning. They bought the house.

They haven't even moved in yet, or been able to decorate etc. His parents being there a whole month means they're going to what? Set up the entire kitchen the way his mom or dad prefers? That's a huge inconvenience imo. If I hadn't yet even seen my house, and my parents or spouse's parents moved in and unpacked everything based on where they wanted stuff, I would be pretty damn upset and I love them all very much. It's a huge imposition to ask to live in someone else's house before it's been set up, and especially if they're not there. \n\nA month isn't a short enough time for anyone (especially family) to not want to settle in comfortably, and at the very least that means a lot of cleaning needing to be done after, as well as turning on utilities for them to use during their stay, etc. That's actually a LOT of stuff to be done, especially if you're not living at the house to get everything in order. People saying YTA have either never bought a house, or never considered this more deeply than \"but they could save money and they're family\".", "Parents are unreasonable they can go to Alaska in August or on June next year. \"I will stay in your house before you move there just because I decided so\" is poor reason.", "What is one of the stupidest things you've heard in your life? That OP's parents would be upset about not being allowed to stay in a completely empty house (plus, I doubt it will even have the utilities turned on while it's unoccupied), or that OP and his wife aren't eagerly jumping on board?", "But your place is set up, unpacked, utilities turned on etc. This seems to be an empty home, likely not liveable without efforts being taken to make it so. Totally different than an already set up home ready to be stayed in. At best it would be a huge inconvenience to set the house up for the parents, at worst, they would unpack and decorate OP's house the way they prefer and OP and wife would have to undo it all.", "NTA they can wait or postpone the trip till you are there and settles and have agreed to host them, otherwise tough shit.", "That it's somehow important to be the first one.\n\nYou said it's not hard to figure out. I'm sitting here scratching my head about why anyone would give a shit about that,\nMuch less why that is a good enough reason to tell your own parents to go fuck themselves.", "If it was an empty unlivable home,  OP presumably would\u2019ve mentioned that. But lots of homes come furnished, particularly when being transferred to a more remote place like Alaska for work. I take the post at face value\u2014the reason they don\u2019t want OP\u2019s parents to stay there is because OP\u2019s wife wants to be the first one there.  That to me is a self-involved reason to not want to help OP\u2019s parents with what\u2019s apparently a dream trip for them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f   And if it is unfurnished but has utilities connected (and i assume it has utilities bc lack of utilities would\u2019ve been very relevant to the post), and OP\u2019s parents were imagining a few air mattresses and bedding, I also don\u2019t understand saying no to that. Not how I would personally vacation though, lol\u2026", "NTA. They can travel at a later time. It\u2019s weird they think it\u2019s ok to be the first in your own home.", "I'm with you, buddy. My parents do favours for me, I do favours for them. No one's keeping score and nothing's ever too much to ask. If there was an opportunity to save them thousands of dollars I wouldn't hesitate, especially not for the sake of preserving the integrity of a vacant house.\n\nYou're talking perfect sense but, for the sake of your sanity, I would just leave it at that.

Unless they have been bad to you, in that case NTA", "NTA!", "Why would they travel to Alaska?", "Set up what? The son can request they leave everything how they found it and make sure the place is spotless if thats what he wants and thats a completely fine request. \n\nAgain, assuming we are talking about a normal family relationship, they would be more than happy to leave the place spotless at the very least if not even help their son by doing some maintenance with the money saved. I don't know what type of people they are so my judgment is simply off of the context given, and with the context given his reasoning is absolutely awful.", "Omg I can totally see this. My family-in-law isn't *nearly* as toxic as reddit stories like this but certain members still try to \"fix\" things and leave new stuff in my apartment if we give them access to collect mail/make sure no pipes broke/etc while we're gone.", "For the furniture that is to *their* taste.  Not OPs", "So you wouldn\u2019t mind if someone wore your brand new pair of shoes before you did? Or slept on your new mattress? Or read your new book?

Your house your choice.", "NTA, but I have to say, there is no magic to being the first ones to stay in the house.  Unless you had it built, other people have in fact stayed there.\n\nIf you specifically don't want them to stay there because they smoke, or are bringing pets, or are total slobs, or some other legitimate reason why having them there will be a genuine hardship for you, then stick to your guns.  But if they're clean and respectful, you might need to ask yourself if this is the hill you want to die on.\n\nYou could also ask them to pay some rent for the house--surely they were planning to spend money for lodging on their trip and not just sleep in the forest?  Maybe if you sour the deal a little by asking for money, they'll reject it on their own terms.\n\nFinal note: if you have plans to ever stay at your parent's house again, this incident gives them carte blanche to tell you to get a motel room for Xmas, Thanksgiving, or whatever else.  It's great to set boundaries with your parents, but again, *if you in turn don't want this boundary for yourself*, give it some thought.", "Most definitely NOT TAH......\n\nThe ONLY TWO ppl who stepped foot in our house when we were buying it was our Realtor and her friend whom is an Interior Designer!! \n\nWe asked our Realtor to show her the house empty so when we go to redo the inside, she already knows what it looks like empty and furnished by us so she would have a better idea of the space and our taste.\n\nNot even the previous owner came in the house after she moved out until we were a week from move in and got the keys from her......the house set for almost a year empty", "NTA.

Tell them you love them, that they're welcomed to stay with you ONCE you and your wife have had a chance to settle in.

Congratulations on your new home!", "NTA- Literally if this breaks your relationship with your parents then your relationship was already shit( to those saying you are). You dont have to house family just because they are related to you. This is your first home with your spouse. That's something special and should be looked at as such. If they've been planning for 2 years they probably have other options. Plus you arent even going to be there so if anything is damaged when your not there who's going to have to fix it. This reaction from them is rather odd imo and feels more that they are annoyed they dont have control over you anymore.", "NTA, your house, your rules.", "NTA.

Yeah the MIL should have asked but jeez, begrudging a mom who wants to be near her son in the hospital (because she got to sleep in your apartment first??? those two things are not the same) is pretty awful.

I don't think that's weird and I'm trying to get you to put into words why you think that it is weird. This isn't an innately weird thing. What specifically makes it weird?

When you plan a vacation, do you buy the cheapest plane tickets you can find? Does that mean you can't afford it? Or does it mean that you just want to save some money? My mom and aunt stayed in my apartment for a trip. They absolutely could have afforded to stay in a hotel, but instead they used that money that they would have spent on a hotel on other things like nice dinners and special activities. Does that mean they couldn't afford the trip? No, it absolutely does not, and you are being obtuse if you think that wanting to save some money means you can't afford a trip.", "I mean, sure, but some people just have slight flaws and are otherwise good people, overall.

First off, are the utilities even on? The first months in a new place are always shakedown, figuring out what's broken, etc. It's not like that's a fully operational house.

OP, you're absolutely in the clear here.", "NTA", "If my kid said no, then they asked me for a favor my boundary would be no also for a very long time. I guess if boundaries are more important than relationships to this younger generation", "I am 45 and my parents were not perfect but I always respected them. I can't even think of having them stay at a hotel while I have a vacant house sitting there. Maybe its a generation or culture thing.  Yes, parents are responsible for raising kids but the mere fact that you exist deserves some respect towards parents assuming they fed, clothed you and kept a roof over your head. I would have never done that to my parents", "This is so funny and beyond unusual. Most people aren't simply not this fussed about people (family specially) staying in an empty house before you move in. Wild.", "I used to live there, and it's not unusual for this to happen. Alaska is a long way from the rest of the states, and Alaska itself is enormous. [https://www.alaska.org/how-big-is-alaska](https://www.alaska.org/how-big-is-alaska) Flying up there is time consuming - direct flights are not out of the question, but it's far more common to have a layover in Seattle. If Anchorage,  Fairbanks, or Juneau is where one is going, then the travel is relatively straightforward- just long and expensive.Now, if one is going to a smaller town or village then getting there adds more time - sometimes another hour, sometimes another day. If the town or village is on the road system, driving is an option. Sometimes it's not that long of a drive - just an hour or two (or three), but it can take 6 hours to drive from Anchorage to Valdez. But sometimes getting where you're going is easier with a flight, or it might be the only way to get there, and this requires another flight since most of Alaska is not on a road system. Flights usually have to be booked separately from a major airline, too. And they may only have one flight a day, and lord help us if the weather is bad enough that the flight has to be canceled, and hope that there will be room for you on the next flight, and if not, hopefully you can get on the next one after that.\n\nDriving to get up there takes days - it's an amazing trip but it's long and expensive. It's also expensive to stay in Alaska.Plus there are people constantly moving in and out of state for work and/or the military, and summertime sees a huge surge of people.  If one is short on time or money, buying it without actually seeing the house is the most practical option. Sometimes it doesn't work out that well, but most of the time it doesn't seem to be an issue.", "Because most home purchases involve spending the first few months finding out and fixing all the crap the seller lied about/didn't mention/ etc. etc. There's always SOMETHING.

What if there are a ton of mosquitos (yep Alaska has terrible mosquitos) but no/holey screens and they decide to nuke the place with pesticides?  What if parents assume they can treat an Alaskan house the same way they treat their own place? (That would be a big nope, Alaskan here.) June in AK is Summer Solstice; what if there are no window coverings?  OP is making the right choice here.", "Yeah that\u2019s too much closeness", "Don't forget the \"surprise - we repainted\" aspect either!", "Ya know even though I now live in Australia my brain is still European set and forget just how enormous and remote some parts both my country now and America are, it's so vast and enormous and I forget that totally, I get it now! Thanks.", "Yes, but OP never even alluded to any of that. According to what he's written, he's saying no purely because of some pathological need to have firsties on the house.\n\nSo even if it is the right choice, it's for the wrong reasons, so I'm still in the YTA camp.\n\nDespite the valid considerations you've listed, if there were a chance to save my parents thousands of dollars, I think I'd at least try to make it work. They'd do the same for me.", "Yeah I feel like I\u2019d be happy to offer? But I guess I don\u2019t know what type of parents OP has.", "Its not that they can't afford it. I know if family comes into town, they don't stay in a hotel. If I travel where I have family, I don't stay at a hotel. We never abuse this but staying at a hotel with a vacant house right there. Yeah, this sounds beyond selfish. If they bought the house without his wife seeing it how is his parents staying there such a big deal. Selfish. The OP probably asks his parents for favors and maybe even had them.oay for a wedding and college then when they ask for something, its like ugh no, you pay for your own vacation.", "It\u2019s selfish to want to use someone\u2019s house for a month before the owners can see it or live in it. Nice assumptions tho!", "It definitely is weird. This is not an Airbnb - this is OP\u2019s new house that he hasn\u2019t got to live in yet.
