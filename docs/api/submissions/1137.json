{"id": 1137, "submission_id": "ylxncg", "title": "AITA for blocking my aunts number when she needs me the most?", "selftext": "  \n\nA little backstory: I (25F) have an aunt(52F) who has been the funny aunt throughout my childhood. She has been to Australia for long periods of time throughout the years and her dream was to move there. Started to study English (a required test to work in Australia) but after 15 years, she has still not cleared that exam. I admire her for never give up but it has basically ruined her life. She lives with my grandmother (74F) when she is not off to work for limited time employments. She has for the last couple of years seemed depressed and has rarely been able to work the entire contract time because, according to her, everyone else is the problem. I have suggested multiple times that she should seek therapy.\n\nNow to the situation, me, and my sister (23F) has been her confidence and constant therapists. She has said multiple times that we are like her children. Always worrying about us to the degree that going out of our own apartment door was dangerous and that everyone online were the tinder-swindlers. It was therefore not weird at all when she called and told me she meets someone online. I was happy for her, until she mentioned a certain celebrity name as her boyfriend. She said that they had begun to talk through Instagram, a fan account. I told her to be careful and to not get her hopes up to high that he is the real one. \n\nAfter two weeks my sister sent me a text, it was about aunt, wanting borrowed money back instantly. She also said something cryptic to my sister about not being able to say why. My sister sent the money and after consulting me, she began messaging the \u201cBoyfriend\u201d. It did not take long for her and me based on the responses that it was not the real. The morning after my sister messaged me. Apparently, our aunt\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d was very sick and apparently his bank accounts had been \"suspended\". I took it on myself to call my aunt that was crying, begging me to borrow her money to send, since he was \"dying\". I told her quite straight on what we found. Apparently, she had sent all the money she been saving up for Australia (just under 2000$). She hanged up to talk to him and told me she would call later.\n\nAfter three days I got curious, because I had not heard anything (and were a bit worried about her mental health). Went over to Instagram and realized that both me and my siter had been thrown out from her Instagram account. She still followed the \u201cBoyfriend\u201d. Sister had also sent a text, asking how she was doing and just got one word \u201cgood\u201d, out of character for her.\n\nGot very irritated and blocked her on my phone. Not because she followed him, but because she did not write or say anything but rather just threw us out. \n\nTwo weeks later my sister calls me, telling me my aunt tried to reach me and that she needed to borrow 200$ to transfer to celebrity.\n\nWe both agreed on not doing it and my sister blocked her to. \n\nNow she has unfollowed the account, but I still have not unblocked her. I cannot help but feel bad over this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667564699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylxncg/aita_for_blocking_my_aunts_number_when_she_needs/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can think of a way to try to help her get well, by all means, do it. But if there\u2019s nothing you can do, protecting yourself is fine.  Are there any other family members you can enlist to try to intervene? This shouldn\u2019t just be on you and your sister.", "NTA.  \nIt's not your responsibility to look after her. You did your best to warn her and keep her out of harms way and she chose to ignore. I wouldn't say block her out forever if this is the only situation she's acted like this, but definitely give yourself time and space from her if you need it.", "NTA\n\nI do feel sort of sorry for the older people that get caught up with these scammers.   It's so hard to convince them that their being scammed.  It's okay that you blocked her.  Give her like a timeout and then unblock her in a few months.  At least to check on her.  If she starts back up though then you know what need to be done.", "Your aunt is in real trouble and she is too deep in it to get out on her own.\n It will leave her financially (not your problem) and emotionally (you could care about this if you like your aunt) broken. \nA friend of my mother who experienced this kind of love scam committed suicide which is why I take this problem really serious.\n\nIf I were you I\u2018d informed all other family members who care for her, start an intervention with all of them together - make her watch love scam documentaries while sitting with her, not leaving her alone during the time. \n\nYeah, it\u2018s hard work and emotionally tiring to you but as you said in the title - this is the time she needs you most. That\u2018s what caring family is for. Help one another when shit hits the fan and not giving up on them. \n\nYou have to understand that she\u2018s in denial and she\u2018ll fight back in self-defense by blocking you or telling you to leave her alone. That\u2018s normal behavior in distress, especially when pride and shame get involved as well. \n\nI can\u2018t say she\u2018s the AH because she\u2018s a victim who is psychosocial and emotional depended on her scammer by now. But if you block her completely and ignore her because it\u2018s \u201eannoying\u201c I feel like you\u2018re a soft AH. - Or at least not a person to rely on in emergency situation.", "Thank you for your respons, it means a lot. Have been trying for years now to convince her to seek proffesional help, but she denies it. Yes, I don't blame her for it, he sent her pictures and vidoes that seem authentic until you learn what you can buy online.", "I think I needed to hear that cause I am almost crying. I have talked to my dad  and explained to him what is going on. He has been trying before this to talk to her to get some help, but as he said when I told him \" if she is unwilling there is nothing we can do\". But thinking about talking to him again and ask him, if he and my other aunt can try to convince her to report and go to thearapy. Thank you for respons!", "Thank you for your respons, it means a lot (defenitly not crying). \n\nShe has never acted this way towards me, but I would say that she has villanised the entire family and her friends for the past couple of years, so it's no suprise. That was why I was kind of protective of her, since me and my sister were one of the few she felt she could share her feelings with But the money thing is new, I will probably unblock her in a couple of months. Just have to, as you say, give it time. Do probably never wanna get that close to her again."]}
