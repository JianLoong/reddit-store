{"id": 33140, "submission_id": "18jutme", "title": "AITA for not inviting my brother in laws girlfriend to Christmas?", "selftext": "I have been with my husband (Adam) for 12 years total, we have three young children, the last three Christmas\u2019 Adams family have come from different states to spend Christmas at my house. Originally his parents hosted Christmas, but due to having babies etc we didn\u2019t want to fly. Everyone has been happy with this arrangement previously, and it means 5 of his family members stay here for 5 days over Christmas. This includes his brother Matthew, and his other brother and sister in law. \n\nMatthew is a good kid (even though he is 26 now), and is very much the youngest child and was a bit of a wild child when he was younger partying etc. The family was happy when he seemed to get in a serious relationship with Alice last year. I have no issue with Alice. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA, i invited everyone to Christmas in June (I did not invite Alice, I assumed she would be seeing her family). \n\nI get a message a couple of weeks ago from my MIL about Christmas and she mentions Alice wanting to make a dish. I reply back stating I didn\u2019t know Alice was coming and she wasn\u2019t invited. This caused a load of text messages and phone calls. I eventually left this till Adam was around to deal with. \n\nAdam just thinks Alice should come, however there is not room in the house. Matthew usually sleeps in the office and this would not fix a double bed in. In addition, while I like Alice I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day. \n\nMe and Adam have majorly fallen out about it, so he went back and said there was not room in the house but Matthew and Alice were welcome to get an Airbnb / hotel and come round on Christmas Day. At this point Matthew just said he wasn\u2019t coming if they were not welcome. This has now cause my MIL to state that she might just host a \u2018small Christmas\u2019 at home (Adams other brother and sister in law are clearly debating this option). \n\nAdam now wants to go back to Matthew and say it\u2019s no issue, in the event they sleep in the snug. Again I don\u2019t like this set up, as my kids use that room as a living room / play room, and it\u2019s their Christmas. Adam and I argued this morning and he went out hours ago and has just text to say he will be back this evening he needs \u2018to cool off\u2019, and I need to consider how selfish I am being. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1702744270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jutme/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_in_laws/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound very inflexible and like a true pain in the ass. You say there\u2019s no room but your husband mentions the snug. I\u2019m sure the kids will be happy wherever they play with their relatives. However I think your husband should leave Scrooge home and take them to his mother\u2019s with the rest of the family.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re making a very big deal out something that should be a non-issue.  \n\nYou couldn\u2019t suck it up for the holiday to keep the peace and be inclusive?  Holidays are about togetherness.  If they\u2019re okay to sleep in the office together, God bless them!\n\nWhy do you care about your kids spending a holiday with someone who may not be there in 10 years?  That\u2019s a ridiculous notion.  You\u2019re being unkind, selfish and exclusive.\n\nIf I were ~~Adam~~ Matthew and Alice, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable coming to your house at this point.  Can\u2019t blame the rest of the family for making other arrangements.", ">The family was happy when he seemed to get in a serious relationship with Alice last year.\n\n>i invited everyone to Christmas in June (I did not invite Alice, I assumed she would be seeing her family).\n\nSo Matthew had been with Alice minimum 6 months, possibly a year or more when you sent out invites. YTA for not even having any discussion with your husband about whether to invite Alice, including the sleeping logistics. It's his house, too. And the nice human thing to do is extend the invite even if you think it's unlikely to be accepted.\n\n>from my MIL about Christmas and she mentions Alice wanting to make a dish. I reply back stating I didn\u2019t know Alice was coming and she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nAt this point a nice human would have seen the golden opportunity to be able to completely hide the initial faux pas of not inviting a significant other who should have been invited. YTA for doubling down instead. \n\n>while I like Alice I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day.\n\nLady, you've completely lost the plot here. Matthew and Alice have been together at least a year now (since sometime in 2022), maybe even closer to 2. And anyone might not know your children in 10 years. Divorce. Death. Life changes. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYou do have options to host one more person, and your husband wants to host Alice, so why are you putting up a fight about something that will create almost zero issues? There's a play room, there's an office that is tight but will work, and everyone wants Alice there, except you. \n\nYou also seem very surprised that there may be consequences to not including Alice. Sure, you are the host- although your husband is too but you seem to not care a bit about what he wants- but people can decline your invitation if it doesn't suit them, and not having Alice there doesn't work for your BIL, and your other inlaws seem to agree. \n\nYou were once the \"girlfriend\" too, and how do you think you get welcomed to the family if no one was willing to make space for you? It is also kind of gross to point out BIL was a \"wild child\" when he is 26 and has had the same girlfriend for a year; literally nothing weird or wile about a 25 year old dude being single and dating through 25.", "YTA.  Unless the woman has horribly wronged you make it work.  Good grief.  Nothing like creating completely unnecessary drama around the holidays.", "Yta for your comment about who might not be in their life in 10 years. That's just immature. No one will care in 10 years.", "YTA.  Seems like there\u2019s something you\u2019re leaving out because the reasons you shared here are not worth not inviting her to Christmas.  They\u2019ve been dating for 6 months.  There\u2019s a chance she could marry him and not only her but your other in laws will remember you being an AH to Alice this first Christmas that you didn\u2019t all spend together because of you.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to host Christmas and you invite your in laws over then you need to be prepared to extend that invitation to their significant other as well.", "YTA. You are behaving like a tight ass because maybe they won\u2019t be together in 10 years? And you think your kids will give a shit? You are creating the problem and then whining about it.", "YTA. Congrats you nuked everyone\u2019s relationship with your husband and yourself. Quit acting like kids dictate the holiday it\u2019s for family and you aren\u2019t acting like you are a part of one. On the bright side no one will stay with you so I guess you come out a winner huh?", "YTA It's Christmas,  the season of good will to all.  What a horrible example you're setting to your children.  Poor Alice, no room at the inn sound familiar?", "Yes.\n\nFor you it really was about not having Alice around your children; if it were a space issue you would have dealt with it differently.\n\nYou could have brainstormed this last June to work out the details if it were a space issue.\n\nYou need to work this out with your husband and brainstorm a solution.  You really \"appear\" like you don't want Alice involved.\n\nWhat if instead, your entire family (everyone) rents a huge AIRBNB together where everyone fits?  That could be great fun.  Alice could even have her own room.", "YTA, all this drama for absolutely no good reason", "YTA - You state two reasons, neither of which are IMO reasonable. First is space. It is not super comfortable, but Matthew & Alice could share a single bed, or one could sleep on an inexpensive blow up mattress, or many other things. Second is you only want your kids to spend Christmas with people you are certain will be in their lives a decade from now? That is bizarre on its face, and certainly not worth spoiling relationships over.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"At this point Matthew just said he wasn\u2019t coming if they were not welcome. This has now cause my MIL to state that she might just host a \u2018small Christmas\u2019 at home\" .. A reasonable solution.", "YTA.\n\nIf Christmas had been held at your in-laws, she would have been invited and interacted with your children.\n\nAs someone who met a couple of my brother's girlfriends as a child at the holidays, it really is not the big deal you imagine for the kids to meet her, whether they last or not.\n\nYou were given a compromise where they wouldn't necessarily stay with you and you've still shot it down. Your husband obviously feels strongly about it, your in-laws are considering a separate gathering... does it not feel like you might be digging your heels in over something not worth it?\n\nFurthermore the kids playroom thing blows my mind. The idea they can't give up that space for a few days is wild and gives off the impression that you are quite precious about your children.", "YTA, but imho the damage is done. I doubt there\u2019s any way forward at this point without Matthew feeling resentment. Good luck", "YTA\n\nSo at a family event in June, where Alice was included, you made an announcement to the group inviting everyone to Christmas at your house. \n\nGUESS WHAT! \n\nYOU invited Alice. \n\nYou invited everyone within the sound of your voice to Christmas. If you didn\u2019t want to invite Alice you shouldn\u2019t have made the group invite to a group she was currently included in. If you didn\u2019t want her included, you should have waited to invite people directly & clarify that you do not want to include anyone not directly invited. \n\nYou are now making a big deal that is causing problems. You are making problems. You are the cause that is ruining Matt\u2019s & Alice\u2019s Christmas. You are the cause that is creating problems in Matt & Adam\u2019s relationship. You are the one putting your MIL in a difficult position. You are the one cause an issue with a woman who may be your future SIL. \n\nJust tell them it will be a tight squeeze but if they don\u2019t mind, you don\u2019t mind. Your kids will be fine. Stop trying to use them as an excuse because you rudely inviting everyone but Alice in front of Alice & then being this nasty because no one was able to read your mind that Alice is unwelcomed in your home.", "Yes, YTA\n\n> In addition, while I like Alice I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day. \n\nThis is the most absurd thing I've ever read.  What a selfish and crazy thing to say. How misguided and small minded.  \n\n  I put my nephew in the ground yesterday.  He was only 31. I'm sorry to inform you but nobody in your life is guaranteed to still be here in ten years, including your kids and yourself.  \n\nHere's another newsflash. The holiday doesn't just belong to you. Or your kids.  It belongs to everyone.  For no reason at all you've reached out to exclude someone and make their holiday now a puzzle of choosing with whom they should celebrate. For no reason at all! \n\nBut if she is still around in ten years, you've created a decade of awkwardness for nothing.  For a tiny moment of feeling in control. \n\n Holidays are about treasuring this moment, right now, with the people you love.  It's about making memories. You could...I dunno.... just try and enjoy the holiday and maybe even bond with her and find out she's secretly the best friend you never expected.  She could turn out to be one of your kids favorite people, even if she's only around for one holiday.  \n\nI just don't understand why people want to be so mean.", "YTA for this reason alone: \"I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day.\"\n\nThat is the weirdest reason I have ever heard for not inviting someone. Maybe you shouldn't ever have any non-family people over ever, including your friends \u2014 you might not know them in ten years.\n\nI don't understand why you're being so proprietorial about this specific room. It's only five days. When you have family over, it gets crowded. \n\nI think you do have issues with Alice; why didn't you ask your brother if his GF wanted to come instead of \"assuming\" she'd be with her family?\n\nYou should let them stay @ your home.", "Yta OP. You sound completely jealous. You said he's the youngest son of your in laws so I'm guessing his gf is around his age. So she's young, probably pretty attractive, and helpful. Since your mil said she'd like to bring a dish over. \n\nNow that you've alienated someone that you in laws have accepted they are refusing to come see you and would prefer a small holiday with them including the gf. \n\nReeks of jealously to me as you're unwilling to compromise with your husband to the point that he's left the house for hours to get away.", "YTA, OP. Matthew and Alice have been dating seriously for about a year, it sounds like.,she warrants an invitation, I think. Whether their relationship turns into marriage or not is not for you to base your decision on. She\u2019s an important part of his life now. If you wish to have everyone together at your house, do invite her, too. They don\u2019t have to sleep together by the way. My male cousin\u2019s girlfriends always used to have to join the five girl cousins in the bunk room at our Christmases; it was truly a test for them! Lots of fun, and they didn\u2019t all marry him, but one did. So Alice can sleep on a couch but include her. Your children will learn more from your generosity of spirit and open arms than they would from a too-cautious curating of their holiday.", "Just admit that you don't like Alice \n\nYTA", "Super duper asshole..\"I don't want anyone that may not know my kids in 10 years around them on their Christmas day\" is such a ridiculous statement. You know you're being the asshole.", "YTA for saying this without discussing with your husband first.", "Pettinss at Christmas...such a good look!  \nYTA", "YTA\n\n>I have no issue with Alice. \n\n>I like Alice\n\nI don't believe you. Be honest now. Why don't you like her? Because you haven't given a valid reason why she can't come.", "YTA. Let\u2019s make some maths. You\u2019re with your husband for 12 years. You say you need a person to be around for 10 years. But you also say you make Christmas for 3 years at your home. So I guess your husband didn\u2019t let you come to their the first 9 years ? No ? See it from the other perspective. You meet someone and then you meet his family. The first time is very stressful. You rarely have the opportunity to make a second first good impression. You\u2019ve just show how selfish you are with your family. This poor girl had probably changed her plans with her own family to be with her boyfriend, which is an important proof of love. And you just consider her as a stranger. Remember you\u2019ve been that stranger 12 years ago and call her to apology", "YTA\u2026 ur hosting Christmas at your place bcoz it\u2019s convenient for you too to not travel with kids. It\u2019s a family event, how can you decide who is a significant other to your BIL and how long she will last in his life. You are not only selfish but also in denial about how selfish and uptight you are. They should all do Christmas somewhere else. This is like those bratty kids who say my ball my rules.", "YTA. It sounds like if you don't rearrange your petty direction you and your husband are the ones that won't be together in 10yrs. I kinda get it, I mean, I always let my magic 8 ball determine who gets a coveted invite to sleep on my office floor for 5 days during the holidays. Unless you have a REALLY LEGITIMATE reason for being so anti Alice that you're withholding,  you're definitely the AH. She was gonna bring a dish for chrissakes!!!", "YTA. You clearly just don\u2019t want Alice there. \nWhen I was a kid my uncle who was the \u201c26 year old kid\u201d brought his long term girlfriend to Christmas. Actually he brought her to a few christmases\n( didn\u2019t meet your requirement of 10 years which u find hilarious since you say yourself you have been with your husband 12 years total.) \nI am somehow not traumatised that my uncle broke up with his girlfriend that I saw at Christmas as a child.  \nYou could be divorced from your husband by next Christmas", "INFO: What is your *real* issue with Alice? Just that she\u2019s younger and hotter than you? Smarter and funnier? Your husband pays her too much attention?", "YTA. And a shitty mom for using your kids as an excuse while trying to get what YOU want. Just admit you don\u2019t want her there instead of all that bullshit about how it\u2019s your kids\u2019s Christmas (as though it\u2019s not EVERYONE\u2019S Christmas) and how they may not know her in 10 years. News flash: your BIL and SIL may be divorced 10 years from now. Does that mean SIL should be excluded? Matthew may well have gone NC with you by then, should he be excluded because he may not be around them in a decade?\n\nAnd what kind of shitty host lets their kids use a room someone is staying in as their play room while the guest is there? Try parenting your kids and have them play in their own bedroom while guests are there. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s not just your kids\u2019s Christmas. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s Christmas. Your kids aren\u2019t that special that everyone has to do what you want. \n\nI hope your in-laws have their own Christmas and your husband spends the whole day angry with you over it.", "YTA for blowing up Christmas for your family. Like honestly what\u2019s the point of even posting here or than to complain more since everyone in your life is already calling you the AH. And frankly back tracking and inviting Alice now probably won\u2019t work. The damage has been done and I doubt if you and your husband will ever be allowed to host Christmas again because of how unwelcoming you are.", "Yeah YTA. You can accommodate them for 5 days, it\u2019s not going to ruin your life or traumatize your kids. \nYour SO is correct, you are being selfish.", "YTA, and you deep down know it. They\u2019ve been together for a year and it\u2019s clear they would want to spend Christmas together. It\u2019s perfectly normal to invite siblings or children partners even if they are not married to the holiday. \n\nAccept it, apologize, invite them both and move on. Or accept you\u2019ll never have Christmas at your house again with your in-laws.", "YTA over the years I had people over for holidays who didn\u2019t know my kids ten years later.\nSometimes they were actually my kids friends who had nowhere else to go.\nThere was no harm done to them.", "YTA Christmas doesn\u2019t belong to just YOUR children.", "YTA\n\nyou are somehow trying to protect your own sense of your children\u2019s entitlement vs being an actual host. \n\nbut then i guess it\u2019s clear you are not hosting christmas for his family because you want to spend it with them, but because controlling the experience for your offspring is what is most important.", "Yta, I think you do have an issue with Alice because I can't understand why else this would be an issue. There are plenty of people who might not be there for Christmas in ten years...including you, especially if your husband is really upset by this causing a separation in your marriage that gets wider. My mother has never missed a Christmas with my kids (under the age of 10) and she died two years ago. Not something I expected since she was relatively young but it happens.", "YTA\n\nJust a personal reflection - I am the youngest (in fact I\u2019m just a year older than Matthew) and sometimes it is exhausting to be infantilised by the wider family. This is not some fling at 18, but an established, serious relationship which clearly means a lot to Matthew.  \n\nYou\u2019re coming across as if you don\u2019t consider him an equal adult - you\u2019re inflexible to a point it seems like you don\u2019t value his relationship. What would your plan be if he were ever to get a wife, as your SIL has always been accommodated?\n\nYour behaviour and language (calling him a kid at 26!) is going to cause serious damage to your husband\u2019s relationship with his brother\n\nWhether intentional or not it will be perceived as belittling what sounds to be his first serious relationship. That will not be forgotten, particularly if this goes the distance. \n\nThe family has already accommodated yourself by moving the venue to convenience you, as they respect your family, it is time you respected Matthew\u2019s.", "this reads like nothing but jealousy OP.  and it's extra icky that you're using your kids as your excuse. \"Someone who won' be around in 10 years\" -- like what is this woman going to do that will be so memorable that your kids are going to be thinking about her a week from now?\n\nYou sound like you're unhappy he has a gf and is happy... do you perhaps have a crush on your youngest BIL? Or do you think that Alice is going to become the favoured DIL and steal away your Christmas celebrations and everyone will love her more? \n\nYTA you are being selfish, and it's distasteful to use your kids as an excuse. Maybe work on your feelings of inferiority around Alice, your BIL was always going to find himself a partner.", "YTA are you aware that this is not only your child's Christmas ?First of all you make everybody travel to your home because of your little babies can't travel because... we don't know you must be the only personn of the world having children for Christmas. And now you are going to ruin all the relation in a family just because you don't want to let your BIL's girlfriend spending Christmas with you. You talk about you BIL like if he were a child he is 26, the only thing you are getting is you being avoid from all the gathering because you are too entilted and don't know how respect works. But your MIl is gonna put you in your place because you need a reality check you and your desire are not the priority of all the family. I just see a personn who is not even family rejecting the new girlfriend because she does not want to share the family, you does not want admitted that they have their place as couple they are not teenager and if you want to host because you don't want to move your .....  there you host EVERYBODY.", "YTA for this:\n\n>In addition, while I like Alice I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day. \n\nThis is ridiculous and it sounds like an excuse. If you didn\u2019t have room for Alice, you just had to tell them that and let them work it out.", "YTA. When you invite family to a major holiday event, you should assume and include their significant other in that invite (provided the significant other is actually significant ex. Not a passing fling). They\u2019ve been together for over a year now so this should\u2019ve been a duh moment for you as the hostess. You can\u2019t guarantee that the people who show up to Christmas now will show up to Christmas in 10 years. You might not be there, your brother in law might not, the list goes on. Marriage is not a permanent thing. Divorce is real and happens to even the most seemingly happy couples. So it boils down to this: if you want to be the host, then you get to host people who aren\u2019t related and might never be because they\u2019re currently dating the invited family or if you\u2019re unwilling to do that, you can start figuring out getting to your in laws every year with your kids and they\u2019ll host. And either way, when you found out Alice was attending it should\u2019ve been an \u201coh, ok. I\u2019ll make the necessary arrangements\u201d.", "YTA\n\nI come from a a large family and we all celebrate the holidays together.  We frequently have guests that are not known to all of the children.   Friends with no one to spend Christmas with, new boyfriends, girlfriends.  All the children  are used to this and never question it or the people.  We even do family pictures with the guests in them. \n\nThis year my daughter is bringing her new boyfriend who has come over from England and everyone is excited to meet him.   We generally have 30 people for more for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.   Family all work together to find places for everyone from out of town to sleep.  Including sleeping on couches or pillow beds, in unfinished basements whatever is needed.    \n\nYou are making obstacles where there are none and need to look into your motives for yourself.  These obstacles will impact your marriage and have probably already damaged your relationships with all of the in-laws.   You need to evaluate if this is worth all of the damage.", "Yeah, YTA. This isn\u2019t a new relationship. You\u2019re simply being unreasonable. \n\nThis entire post is about you and your kids. You do know the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you, right?", "I think you're doing Christmas wrong.\n\nThe message was about kindness, generosity, giving, and hospitality. So on every level, you are the AH.\n\nWhy you think that Christmas should only be restricted to immediate family and legal spouses, and apparently that your children cannot be exposed to strangers is anyone's guess, but again: you're doing Christmas wrong.\n\nYTA in spades.", "YTA. So much so. They've ALL been traveling to your place for years to accommodate you and your kids, and you're seriously acting like you can't cram one more person in somehow? You're seriously about to blow up your relationship with all of your ILs so no one will sleep in your kids' playroom? This shouldn't even affect the kids ...surely they're already in bed when Matthew and Alice would be going to bed, since they're so little you don't want to fly with them. Why would they care that their uncle and his GF are sleeping in the playroom while they're in bed?", "YTA. I mean who knows. Maybe you won\u2019t be around in ten years. Ever hear of divorce?", "YTA", "YTA. This is not the hill to die on.", "YTA\n\nFor a lot of reasons, but mostly for saying you're leaving the decision in your husband's hands and then back paddling when he doesn't make the decision you want him to make.", ">Again I don\u2019t like this set up, as my kids use that room as a living room / play room, and it\u2019s their Christmas.\n\nNo Christmas for the rest of us?

Surely you could figure something out for 5 days.  This lady might end up being your sister in law.  You are setting the tone for your relationships.

Have fun flying with your 3 kids every year if you want family Christmas ever again because they will not want you to host ever again. Those kids will miss out on having big family events because you wanted to exclude 1 person. YTA. Advice: grovel your apologies to Alice and your BIL. Blame holiday stress and apologise to everyone. Or just have quiet christmases from here onward.", "YTA. Matthew is 26 and is in a long-term serious relationship. The two plan to spend Christmas together, wherever it occurs. Are you planning to not let Alice come over until and unless they are married? \n\nYour desire to have the perfect vision of Christmas for your kids is hurting your husband\u2019s family. Your husband is right - you are being selfish. You are acting as if your desires are more important than the collective desires of you husband\u2019s family. Do your desires outweighs Matthew\u2019s, your husband\u2019s, and his parents desire to get to know their perhaps future DIL, etc? When they are already traveling to your house to accommodate your family?

Originally his parents hosted Christmas, but due to having babies etc we didn\u2019t want to fly. Everyone has been happy with this arrangement previously, and it means 5 of his family members stay here for 5 days over Christmas. This includes his brother Matthew, and his other brother and sister in law. \n\nMatthew is a good kid (even though he is 26 now), and is very much the youngest child and was a bit of a wild child when he was younger partying etc. The family was happy when he seemed to get in a serious relationship with Alice last year. I have no issue with Alice. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA, i invited everyone to Christmas in June (I did not invite Alice, I assumed she would be seeing her family). \n\nI get a message a couple of weeks ago from my MIL about Christmas and she mentions Alice wanting to make a dish. I reply back stating I didn\u2019t know Alice was coming and she wasn\u2019t invited. This caused a load of text messages and phone calls. I eventually left this till Adam was around to deal with. \n\nAdam just thinks Alice should come, however there is not room in the house. Matthew usually sleeps in the office and this would not fix a double bed in. In addition, while I like Alice I don\u2019t want people who may not know my children in 10 years at their Christmas Day. \n\nMe and Adam have majorly fallen out about it, so he went back and said there was not room in the house but Matthew and Alice were welcome to get an Airbnb / hotel and come round on Christmas Day. At this point Matthew just said he wasn\u2019t coming if they were not welcome. This has now cause my MIL to state that she might just host a \u2018small Christmas\u2019 at home (Adams other brother and sister in law are clearly debating this option). \n\nAdam now wants to go back to Matthew and say it\u2019s no issue, in the event they sleep in the snug. Again I don\u2019t like this set up, as my kids use that room as a living room / play room, and it\u2019s their Christmas. Adam and I argued this morning and he went out hours ago and has just text to say he will be back this evening he needs \u2018to cool off\u2019, and I need to consider how selfish I am being. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Just tell your family there's no room at the inn but they can sleep in the manger. Guess you forgot the meaning of the holiday. YTA!", "Yes at this point it seems like OP is being difficult just to be difficult. No one is asking your kids to refer to her as Aunt Alice or get close to her, for all they know she\u2019s a family friend. This won\u2019t traumatize the kids they\u2019ll be fine. \n\nAs for sleeping arrangements, your children can survive a few days over the holidays without their playroom. They\u2019re kids, they\u2019ll likely be too excited with all the activities and their family around to care. \n\nSo in the end YTA. Admit that you\u2019re excluding someone and finding excuses due to your personal preferences. Don\u2019t try to justify it using your kids. And know that your inflexible way of doing things may end up depriving your children of a joyous Christmas with the extended family.", "Whoa. If Alice knows about this, I would invite her personally. Tell her you sent out invites 6 months ago and wrongly assumed she was spending Christmas with her family. It will be a little crapped in the office where Matthew sleeps ...yadda yadda ...in other words fix this because your kids seeing Uncle Matthew's girlfriend on Christmas Day will not scar them. Christmas is about family and at this moment Alice is part of Matthew's family. Until you own this situation YTA.", "YTA. Jesus who cares?

Such a dumb hill to die and nuke everyone\u2019s Christmas. And you\u2019re standing with your husband\u2019s family.

That was rude.\n\nDid you invite someone who was in a primary relationship, without considering whether the two of them would want to travel as a social unit at important holidays?   That was rude.\n\nDid you push the issue by insisting that you didn't want her to come to your party, when you found out that she was planning to come? Instead of apologizing for the confusion and inviting her graciously along with whatever dish she was offering to make?  That was also rude.\n\nDid you do all of this without listening to your husband's wishes and expectations?  Are you continuing to dig in your heels instead of asking your husband for help in how to salvage the relationships in the long term?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYep, YTA.  I don't hear anything in the story suggesting that anyone else is behaving badly at all.", "Depends.  Are you willing to accept that this will probably mean you're not hosting this year?", "YTA\nYou don\u2019t have a space issue, ever heard of an air mattress? It really sounds like you don\u2019t like Alice for some reason and are making up excuses not to have her around. Nobody else in the family seems to share this dislike of her.

You are ruining all of this with this problem that you created that is not a problem at all.\n\nThe gf is family right now and who cares if she sleeps with her boyfriend your brother in law in the same bed or not.\n\nYou have no one to blame but yourself for ruining everything. Your husband is right they can sleep on the snug or they can rent a hotel airbnd.\n\nI think you just have a problem with two people who are not married sleeping together in the same bed.  So what if they are not married or not, they have been together for a year and sleeping together. You are the only one who seems to have a problem.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if your husband divorces you over this.", "YTA it\u2019s obvious that you are making flimsy excuses for not inviting her. What\u2019s really going on here? Your first excuse was that he used to switch gf\u2019s quickly and she may not be around. She\u2019s been around for a year so that doesn\u2019t fly. There was no room for a double bed, but you never offered them to snuggle up or try to make any accommodation. So is he not allowed to bring a partner to your home ever? Then it was your kids liked to use that room as a playroom, but Matt usually sleep there every year so this was about you not liking that Matt sleeps with his gf. This all is starting to give the impression that you have a thing for Matt.", "YTA\n\nI do not understand your logic here.\nYou have to know they will be in your life for ten years for you to celebrate christmas?\n\nHe is 26, an adult.\nYou are treating him like a teen who asks to bring a new gf every christmas.\n\nBUT it is your house and your rules, but I still think you are wrong", "So because you didn't want to fly everyone accommodated you and started coming to your house rather than the in laws.  YTA Also tomorrow is not promised you don't know if you or the in laws will be here in ten years either.  Seriously. Grow up.", "I dunno why you\u2019re worried about the ten years thing. You keep alienating your husband and you might not be around in 10 years either. YTA", "YTA.

Maybe YOU won't be around his family in ten years if your husband stops putting up with you. You demand the holiday be hosted by you and then refuse to be a good host.

You didn't stop to think we'll as they were dating in June they could still be dating in December. Admit it, you didn't think about her at all.

What a ridiculous thing to potentially derail your families entire Christmas over. At this point Alice probably won\u2019t even want to come if you change your mind (I know I wouldn\u2019t), and now everything\u2019s going to be split between multiple households.

What I remember of those holidays is playing with my cousins, my auntie (whom I haven't seen in 14 years now) making gingerbread figures to hang in the tree and playing board games.

(Unless obviously they all be OK with not seeing hubby's family at all over Christmas).", "Better than my first thought \"sorry grandma and grampa, you'll be dead in 10 years so I don't want you at Xmas, kids need people who stick around\"", "Every married person I\u2019ve met who had that opinion on divorce absolutely should\u2019ve been divorced themselves too. My friend\u2019s parents didn\u2019t even live in the same country (but it was like a 30 minute flight/1 hour ferry so they could\u2019ve come over anytime\u2026) and apart from the kids had completely separate lives, but they still wouldn\u2019t divorce.", "Thank you for Grinch comment. I'm old and that's the first thing I thought of. Vain, irrelevant excuses with judgement and no heart. Yta Op", "Clearly it was to diminish his current relationship and further her point that she\u2019s not going to be around in 10 years.\n\nBecause god forbid the kids be exposed to someone on x mas who may not be around in 10 years..", "Ouch. Honest answer though.", "Thank you! I know that\u2019s how it was done with my siblings and I when the whole family would come up! We just camped out where we found a spot for when they were! Simply ridiculous and stupid what OP is wanting. \n\nOP YTA", "I laughed at \"it's their Christmas\" as if isn't Christmas for the rest of the family", "Oh, I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s family is invited at all. God knows I wouldn\u2019t host her in my home for love or money. I despise people who think the world revolves around them and their offspring.", "Op chose to change to becoming the Christmas house for her reasons as well! \u201cWe became the Christmas house because we did not want to travel with kids.\u2019 She makes all the rules to suit her. \nAlice sounds lovely, wanting to bring something. She was probably very excited. How sad.", "He says nothing because \u201cno crying he makes\u201d", "My guess is she looks down on her youngest BIL. She calls him a \u201cgood kid\u201d at 26. If she was 60, I could understand it. But they\u2019re in the same generation.", "My guess is she was only ok with the hotel/air bnb compromise because she knew it would never happen. It\u2019s a week out from Christmas, most everywhere is going to be booked up already. What will be available will be unaffordable. \n\nAnd it was such a shitty compromise. \u201cIf you want to spend Christmas with both your family and your gf you have to pay out the ass for whatever accommodations you can find, if you can even find anything, and then we will deign to let you come see *your own parents and brother* for a few hours.\u201d No wonder the MIL is now talking about hosting. She would have to be a shitty person to allow her son to be treated like that.", "I mean, she didn\u2019t even say she was okay with that. Just that was what her husband proposed to his family to find a way to have everyone together. She glossed over how she really felt about that.", "My guess is that OP may end up being the only one not there in 10 years.", "Don't forget about death.  Anyone could die at any given moment.  Perhaps OP gets in a horrible car wreck, and the doctors give her a heart.", "OMG, this is my ex. He told me explicitly that he thought his family was better than mine because mine had divorces in it. \n\nHis parents stomped all over the house screaming at each other 24/7/365.\n\nBut he's an ex-boyfriend and not an ex-husband so still no divorces! Lol!", "People who never had divorce in their family often think it\u2019s the worst thing that could happen. \n\nThose of us who do have divorce in our families know it can be the best thing to ever happen.", "OMG\n\nThis!!!", "Literally anyone in the house could not be around in 10 years. OP writing that was the stupidest thing I've read for ages.", "I'm just convinced she has a thing for BIL. I can't think of any other reasonable motivation.", "Same!  I still remember the year that my cousin and I slept in sleeping bags in the laundry room because we had about 15 people sleeping in our 1000 sq. ft. house.  My dad rented cots from the Salvation Army and some slept on those.  Did I mention we only had one bathroom?  YTA OP!", "Hey everyone! You all better not celebrate Christmas! It\u2019s only for OP\u2019s kids!", "I bet OP is secretly hoping the couple doesn't work out so they don't get married and have kids then they'd probably not want to travel with kids either.  Causing people to pick between them.  Of course they'd not pick OP since she excludes people from Christmas for no good reason.", "touche!", "If there's no room at the inn, I suppose they'll have to sleep in the stable. Unheard of at Christmas.", "I have family members that have made pallets on the floor to avoid hotel/airbnb costs. At least let them have all the information.", "Completely.  \n\nThe disrespect to the baby of the family here is pervading.", "I realized how my comment could have been interpreted as her saying that so I just fixed it to avoid confusion \n\nSorry about that.", "I\u2019m wondering if there is a bigger issue like race or class.  The \u201cmay not be here in 10 years\u201d sounds like such a made up excuse that a bigot might make.  OP also keeps talking about \u201cher kids Christmas\u201d, as if no one else has right to celebrate. I think OP and her kids can celebrate alone and the rest of the family go where they are wanted, including OP\u2019s husband.", "\ud83c\udfc6", "And the fact that the alternative was to put them in an arbnb, which in no way solves the issue of exposing the kids to a transient x mas participant makes it even more stupid.\n\nWasn\u2019t a legitimate cause to begin with but the arbnb solution shows that OP knew that from the start since that issue wouldn\u2019t exactly be moot if they\u2019re still gonna be at x mas..", "I'm thinking Alice is from a different culture/race/religion/whatever and OP just doesn't want to admit it.", "AKA garage -- now being converted to an ADU", "Yep. Matthew and Alice could just unroll a couple of sleeping bags somewhere in OP's house and be fine. OP's kids also aren't going to be focused on the guests and worried if they're going to be there in 10 years or whatever. Maybe OPs in laws like Alice more than OP and she doesn't care for that.", "After reading the post, I can only hope the arrangement be like that \ud83d\ude02", "No I think OP issue is little bro in law isn't married.  She doesn't want to explain to her kids that unmarried couples sleep together.", "Ooo another good explanation. Something is up and it's not something respectable.", "That\u2019s bigoted, and makes a lot of sense. Definite moralizing.", "I mean, I think it's just plain old petty jealousy mixed in with 'I'm not young anymore' panic. After all, BIL 'is a good kid (even though he's 26)' in op's words"]}
