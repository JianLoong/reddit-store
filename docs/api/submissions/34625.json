They grew up in a small town that very few people get out of and my mom was the quintessential popular girl and my dad the smart guy that should've gotten out. As you can imagine, becoming parents at 17 was not easy for them, but I truly believe they did the best they could. However their relationship was always challenging, my Mom was happy to stay in her hometown but my Dad had always hoped for more. We never really became a \"normal nuclear family\", Dad never married my Mom, they lived apart, and I never had siblings, all of which is an especially sore point for my mother. He's still an amazing father, I always felt he was there for me, even though some nights I know he was dog-tired he would still patiently teach me physics. He provided for my Mom and I, doing back-breaking work to now owning his own construction company, dude paid for my college in full. He told me that any college I could get into, he would sponsor my ambitions.   \n\n\nA couple years ago, my Dad met Anne (33F) who use to be my mentor during my college internship, now job. My Mom has not been handling any of this well, she accused my father of trying to replace her with a new stepmom for me, despite that I was almost 20 at the time when Dad and Anne met. When Dad and Anne got engaged and married, mom accused Anne of stealing her life. When they moved out of state to their dream home, Mom accused Anne of being a gold digger. Last month, I found out that Dad & Anne are 4 months pregnant with a girl. Mom found out last week and has been unconsolable. I'm really trying to be empathetic, but her reaction has been so out of proportion,  accusing Anne of stealing my inheritance. I've listened to her for the last 4 years, playing armchair therapist for her issues with Dad, but yesterday I finally hit my limit and told Mom that she really needed to move on from her personal issues with Dad and find a purpose outside of trying to build a life with him because it obviously wasn't going to happen.

It's understandable that you'd hit a breaking point. Sometimes tough love is needed to shake someone out of a destructive mindset. Your suggestion for her to find purpose outside of the drama with your dad might actually be what she needs to hear. It's tough, but you're not wrong for expressing your frustration. Good luck navigating this family drama!", "NTA and I think that was the nicest possible thing you could have said to her. She is wasting a lot of time with blatant envy when she is still freaking young and can go do as she wants right now. Live your life, you're not her support animal. (I stole that last part from another post here because it just works so well).", "NTA. It\u2019s clear that for as long as you can remember dad has only been interesting in coparenting as separated households. And he waiting until you were independent before fully committing to a woman. \n\nThat\u2019s going to hurt your mom, but she\u2019s had decades to grieve a relationship which never really existed.", "After 25 years, during which \"...Dad never married my Mom, they lived apart, and I never had siblings...\" your mom definitely needs to get over it.  She should have found someone herself, and lived her life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like your mum needs therapy to get past these feelings. She shouldn't be putting all this on you to have to deal with.", "NTA.... Mom needs therapy.... Glad to see that despite the rough start in life your dad did the best he could and stood by you...  He'll likely remain steadfast support for you even with the new family... Don't let mom cloud your judgment.... be supportive of her, but also be happy for Dad and Anne and their baby to be", "You're not the asshole. Honestly, I don't think there *is* an asshole in this situation. Your mom isn't being rational, but as you pointed out, she has some issues. It seems like she has spent 20+ years defining herself by a man who doesn't want the same things she does. Sounds like your mom could use professional therapy. She's been using you to fill that role, and that's really not fair to put on you.", "NTA I\u2019m the daughter of a teen mom.  I\u2019m going to be blunt.  Your mom never matured past the age she had you.  She is forever going to be stuck in that teen girl mindset.  Did she go to school? Have a career? She never married?\n\nShes lived a very small and narrow immature life and you need to stop being her emotional dumping ground.  She needs to grow up and get her life together.  Take a step back from interacting with her and see if it improves your mental well being.", "NTA\n\nFrom what it sounds like, your mom spent the last 25 years pining away for your dad.  Dad didn't want your mom.  That's on your mom.  She needs some serious therapy.", "NTA your mum needs therapy and fast. She needs to stop expecting you to be her therapist and wing man. Well done for putting up with it for so long you must be exhausted", "NTA. It sounds like your mom likely has always harbored feelings for your dad. It\u2019s very sad honestly. You need to encourage her into counseling and then probably her getting away from where she lives to start fresh where she has opportunities she didn\u2019t have by staying in the town. She\u2019s still young if she had you as a teen. She deserves happiness too.\n\nETA-not that anyone is the bad guy here, but please also keep in mind you may not know all the ins and outs of your parent\u2019s relationship the last 25 years.", "NTA\n\nI'd let your mom know if she keeps bad mouthing them to you she risks hurting her relationship with you and that is what she should be focused on. I'd suggest she get in to talk to someone other than her child about her issues she's holding on to.", "NTA - You are a supportive adult child who spoke truth; it's what she needed to hear. Unfortunately she has been pining for him for 20+ years so her changing may not be quick nor peaceful. Therapy may be an excellent option for her; someone who will be supportive and validate her feelings while helping her navigate a new life path. In-person, phone and virtual sessions are available.\n\nRemain focused on your life goals. Best to you.", "NTA. This is one of those in which you read the title and it sounds really harsh and AH-ish, but then you read the whole thing and go \u201cwell, seems about right\u201d.\nI wish you luck and honestly hope your mom will finally move on. it\u2019s about time.", "NTA at all. This sounds extremely frustrating for you. I would set some boundaries with Mom. No more Dad or Anne talk.", "NTA.\n\nPart of your mother's concern appears to be \"on your behalf.\"  That may or may not be her putting a less-selfish spin on her personal pity party.  By making clear to her that you 1) are happy for your Dad, 2) you like Anne, and 3) you aren't owed an inheritance and it's up to your Dad to decide what to do with HIS money, you will take away at least half of your mom's objections.\n\nOn that last point, if your Dad has a successful business then he absolutely should have a will.  He can specify what goes to his wife, what goes to you, and what goes to any half-siblings.  It does your mom no good to rail against Anne as a \"gold-digger.\" It only makes sense if her aim is to make YOU not like Anne, so that at least she can't replace your mom in your heart.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe the most important thing is for you to reassure your mom that she cannot be replaced and you will always be HER son.", "NTA\n\nMy mom divorced my dad over 30 years ago and has never moved on or processed the loss. She just let it build to a tumor of hate and jealousy \n\nNo answer just sympathy because you are in for the pain I have had to live with of choosing a parent for every major milestone because they can't be in a room together.", "NTA. Someone eventually had to say it.", "NTA\n\nYou mother needs therapy.  It has been 25 years; they never were together outside of a teen romance it sounds like.  Maybe it would be good for you mother to focus on herself, find some hobbies, maybe even try going on a vacation. \n\n You are not her go to for bad talking your father; you should be the last person in the world she should bad mouth your father to.  That is basic divorce with kids 101.  I had to take a class that taught that when I divorced, sad for your mom they never even took that step.  She truly should have moved on many years ago. \n\nCongratulations on your new sibling.  I hope that with your degree, you are able to get out of the small town, if you want that for your life.", "NTA - I'm in a similar situation, my dad left my mom when I was 6, and for 30 years she's been stuck on what could have been. She has re-married but because my dad 'likely' had an affair and married this woman, my mom has been seething about her ever since.  I like my step mom. My mom constantly makes passive aggressive insults towards both of them and for her own happiness and health, I just want her to get over it.  She won't go to therapy, she likes being angry.  It's awful.\n\nYou were right to say what you said...throw in a little bit of 'you're only hurting yourself' and shut down all conversation about your dad with her...you don't need to be part of her issues.", "NTA. Your dad has finally found happiness. I hope you are able to have a relationship with your future sister.", "NTA at all.  Your mom should have moved on and gotten therapy a long time ago.  I know it must have been hard, being teenage parents, but you're 25 - there's no reason for her to hang on to this resentment.\n\nI've walked a million miles in your shoes.  I'm 60, and my folks have passed away.  But when I was six, my parents got a divorce.  My dad decided he wanted out of the marriage, and my mom would have done anything to hang onto him.\n\nShe behaved much like your mom did - crying, inconsolable, saying horrible things about the women my dad would date.  This went on for decades, and that's no exaggeration.  I love my parents - they were good parents, they loved all of us too.  But this was never ending.\n\nIn 2003, my brother died of cancer.  And at that point, my mom finally let go of all the pain and anger towards my dad, and they grieved together.  That's what it took - it took a literal tragedy before my mom would wake up and let go of all the senseless anger that was poisoning her.  One of her children had to leave this earth never seeing his parents speak kindly to each other.  My parents divorced when I was six - I was FORTY when my brother died, and she finally let all of this go, and turned over a kinder page towards my father.\n\nI think you said the things she needed to hear.  Hopefully for your sake, hers and everyone's, she'll listen.", "NTA, clearly, your mom really loves her dad which sucks for her. But she needs to accept that since she didn\u2019t move on sooner she can\u2019t have that life she dreamed of. She does need to find purpose and it\u2019s not your job to be her therapist. I think you did good OP", "Ahh, know the feeling. After my father's affair and divorce my mother would always pour her hate for AP and other related problems at me. Everything was always about how hurt she was and how they are monsters even tho their marriage was always rather rocky (mainly her fault also). It completely broke me since I was trying to start uni and escape from all that family drama.

Its not like he left her and divorced her for some hot young thang. she just never got the fairytale bs she wanted and is butthurt at others being happy", "Anne did get your Mom's life, but she didn't steal it. Your father gave it to her and you mom is watching someone else live her dreams. She's allowed to be devastated and doesn't need your approval for that. You will never know what it is to be good enough to raise a man's child and still not be good enough for him to marry. \n\nAnd. \n\nYour mother should never have used you as emotional support for her heartbreak. It isn't fair to you, it isn't appropriate, and it isn't going to help her, because you can only see your dad as your dad, and she can only see him as the man she loved for so long and who chose someone else. You can't comfort her through this and she should never have expected you to. She needs peers or a therapist to talk this through with, to confront her fears and hurts, and to see a new kind of dream form, that doesn't include your father. And you need to give her space and boundaries so she can do that. \n\nNAH. Just a lot of hurt.", "i uh well idk not really i mean mama needs to move on and find another man and she still has you.....or at least it sounds like she did but i kinda understand why she'd be so clingy-ish like that but mama needs to move on and find happiness again", "NTA but your dad might be, depending on your answers to the following -\n\nINFO: I know you said they were never married but \u2022 Did your father ever tell your mother that they wouldn\u2019t be a couple? \n\u2022 Was she waiting for him? \n\u2022 Has he led her on throughout the years?\n\u2022 Did she assume they were a couple, despite their separate living arrangements and lack of marriage?\nObviously not accusing him of anything but I am trying to get the whole picture, as your posts leaves quite a lot of important information out", "NTA for your intentions for your mom.   you're right, she does need to move on and find her purpose.  but, maybe she never grieved the life she wanted but never had with your dad, and maybe she's doing that now.  not that she needs to cry on your shoulder about it all the time, but she does need to find an outlet that will allow her to work through all these feelings without dumping and projecting all over you.  maybe a little therapy will help.  you can't put a time frame on how and when people work through their feelings.  people will repress things for decades before they finally face them or they finally rear their ugly heads, ask any therapist about this.  it has to be hard for you, to hear her talk about and cry over your dad and the life they never had, i'm sorry.", "You are not the asshole it was actually really kind to guide your mother. Her behavior is unacceptable.", "I spent a very long time with a man who never really cared for me. He hurt me really badly toward the end but I had no one to blame besides myself.

Her journey through her feelings is not yours to manage. You can ask her to talk with others (not you) about it and that's fine.   You can't know what she's 'going through.", "ESH, you are right but maybe could have said this more tactfully. It really seems like your mom has been holding on to this hope they would actually be a couple for a very, very, very, long time. I don't know that she can just... turn that off at this point.

Many continue having kids as a way to be avoidant of confronting their lack of fulfillment. Others sit paralyzed and can't get passed the what-could-have-been. Mom needs therapy and mentorship bad. Fact she's putting her son into the parental role illustrates she's very lost and desperate for guidance. Please continue to have empathy for your mom OP, however it's not your job to 'fix' her or fair of her to put you in the position that resulted in this post.", "No sorry, mother is TA for making OP play therapist rather than actually seeing one.", "The thing is, I don't think she has feelings per say for my dad. It's more that she has very set ideas of what she wants/deserves. It doesn't help that she's never left the town she grew up in, all her friends married their HS sweetheart and have 2.5 kids next to their parents house. I have deep empathy for her that it must suck to feel as if my Dad never wanted those things with her, but basically leaped and bent over backwards to marry Anne. But to be honest, they're such different people that if they had married, it would've ended in divorce or a mid-life crisis.", "THIS. Trust me.", "i dont think she loves him i think shes obsessed with him and feels like he did her wrong by not marrying her. very different", "OP says his mother just wants the cushy life from dad,and doesn't actually love him. She's TA.", "You know mother is parentifying OP right? Being made into her therapist is absolutely that. OP is entirely right to tell her to back off as that is inappropriate af.", "Lmao at being the one person to come to this conclusion", "> Her journey through her feelings is not yours to manage\n\nDo you think the OP started the conversation with her, or do you think she put that expectation onto them and therefore the OP failing at a job that wasn't theirs isn't their fault, but is solely the fault of the person who repeatedly put them in that position?", "But it's for her to complain to her daughter about?", "Well then maybe OPs mom shouldn't have made their feelings something for OP to manage, yeesh. NTA", "15yrs ago he was a 10yr old child; it's not exactly something a 10yr old should have to tell their parent tbh.", "ABSOLUTELY. Bad enough that she's using him as a therapist of sorts, but the fact that she's trying to unpack her issues with his father is just so inappropriate. She's not a teenager anymore and should know better. I hope she gets some help because it sounds like she's spent more than 20 years wishing for and being bitter about something that was never gonna happen.", "> Father's new beau clearly must be the devil\n\nBelle. It's a she-devil.", "Agree. Mom's 25+ year focus on the dad is very unhealthy. Especially as it sounds like they never lived together and were never a couple after OP was born (or not for long). So mom has been pining for this guy for decades??? OP definitely needs to remove himself from that situation and stop being a therapist.", "You are very wise. Your Mom is lucky to have you, but that is a lot for you to carry. I hope your Mom finds a way to work through her issues. She will never be happy until she does, and she will always be an obstacle to your happiness. \n\nNTA", "Tbh, it was compassionate of you to help your mom but this isn\u2019t your issue. It\u2019s something she has to get over, and she may never get there. \n\nShe could have tried to improve her own life, get married, have children, but she opted not to for whatever reason. That\u2019s not your fault, your dad\u2019s, Anne\u2019s, or your new sister\u2019s. \n\nDon\u2019t waste your life trying to help her with hers.", "Agreed. The dad put up some pretty clear boundaries but not marrying the mom and not living under the same roof. She had 20ish years of being held at arms length to realize the dad was not romantically interested in her any longer. if she truly loved him she would have accepted this hard truth and tried to move on. Instead she's trying to dictate his romantic life.", "The OP confirms this in a comment:\n\n>The thing is, I don't think she has feelings per say for my dad. It's more that she has very set ideas of what she wants/deserves. \n\nOP's mom had a vision for her life when she became pregnant and part of the vision was that it would be the stereotypical \"they had to get married\" and live their lives together whether they actually liked each other or not. Stay in tiny hometown. Probably have another kid. Raise kids. Kids also stay in tiny hometown. Grandkids eventually. Then how old and die. The fact that she kept that vision and still insists on it is the worrying part. She really didn't emotionally grow past the teenage level of maturity.", "He doesn't know that.", "Thanks, my college roommate's parents were therapists, he majored in psych and is training to become a clinician. Bro was definitely flexing his baby therapy skills on me all 4 years of school \ud83d\ude02 Didn't even have to pay.", "He stated it in a comment.", "Were they ever in a serious relationship, even in high school? Or was you kind of a coincidence which made your mom feel \u201cI guess *Dad* is the one I have to spend my life with.\u201d?", "He said he doesn't know ow if there are feelings at this point and doesn't understand how a high school relationship can be serious. Right before saying all her friends married their HS sweethearts...", "How serious could a few month relationship possibly be in HS? I personally don't believe most people have the maturity to evaluate in HS.   \n\n\nI'm biased but growing up folks would bring up how Dad was voted as \"most likely to be Future President\" in HS yearbook and how they always thought he'd be the most successful but \"Mom hooked him\" which now in retrospect must've stung. I don't recall my parents ever being \"together\", they only ever co-parented.", "I have a son your age (and another younger with a different dad). I'm older than your mum and my relationship with his dad wasn't a high school flash in the pan but it was short lived and I also never lived with him, and we Co-parented in the same small town. Over the years we've had a few ups and downs both individually and with each other but one absolutely unshakeable core of our relationship has been the appreciation we've had for each other for parenting with as much love and stability for our son as possible. \n\n\nI remember when our son was about 10, his dad met a woman that he became serious with. Now, I had married and had another son at this point but it was a bad marriage and an unhappy homelife so oh boy did I struggle with jealousy! I never let it show (I hope) but it gutted me when our boy would inadvertently tell me about the great bedtime book she was reading to him, or the lasagne that was \"even better than yours mum!\" (\ud83d\ude05). I felt guilt that our son could never have that \"happy families\" dynamic in my own house and savage pain that he was getting it elsewhere. Obviously, I dealt with those feelings (and left the bad marriage) but it surprised me at the time how powerfully hurtful it felt even though I didn't want to be with his dad. \n\nI wonder if because your mum has never moved on whether these type of feelings are hitting her like a train right now? Even though you're 25? There's the happy family that she feels like she hasn't provided for you?\n\nLastly though, you are obviously NTA..... And you are also not in the right position to be her therapist, although she is laying all this on you. Nor should you feel that it's your responsibility to reassure her. She's a grown woman. But clearly a grown woman having an emotional crisis. I don't know how it would go down if you suggested therapy, but if you think it might look like you're making her out to be somehow inadequate (which could compound the problem if indeed it's based around what I've described) maybe you could suggest going with her? It might be a great help to both of you to be able to separate your relationship with her, from you and your Dad's. Might help her to see that she's the only mum you'll ever have \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f", "You are not wrong. I feel badly for your mother that she is so wrapped up into him still. I hope she gets some help.", "NTA - Here's a totally different question, though. Why are still hanging around this town? You obviously are smart, studied at a good university. Why stick around?", "I have to wonder if OP\u2019s mom got pregnant on purpose.  Here she is\u201417 years old, pretty, popular, and watching all her friends settle down with their high school sweethearts while she\u2019s hooked up with the one guy looking to leave town.  From the level of her delusions, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she assumed having her boyfriend\u2019s baby would not only make him stay in town but also marry her.\n\nOP, you\u2019re 100% NTA.  Your mom has serious issues that she has not dealt with in 25 years.", "you are not the AH. It can be hard to face reality when you have held on to a dream for so long. Your dad deserves to be happy as does Anne. As do you and your mom. The only way for that to happen is for your mom to move on. Sometimes always agreeing to keep everyone happy just ends up making everyone unhappy. Even though it took you getting frustrated to say something, I believe it needed to be said.", "NTA. Mom is stuck in a moment that\u2019s long gone. She needs to let go and move on.", "NTA- I think it\u2019s time that you set clear boundaries with her.  I mean that you do not discuss your Dad at all. If she brings him up\u2026 walk away or end the phone call.  She\u2019s very immature and needs therapy to truly fix her thinking.", "I just have to comment because this is pretty much my life, I'm the baby half sister. My brother's mother, our father's high school sweetheart, prefers to pretend I don't exist. However, he and I are very close, and he has managed to be a supportive son to her over the years. I wish you luck \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't blame you for losing your patience if you have had to manage her emotions.\n\nAlso, I'm seeing hard projection with that \"gold digger\" comment at Anne from your mother.  She is blaming Anne for a choice your father made and seems intent on getting chosen by your dad for money.  The thing about replacing her as your stepmom does not sound healthy either.", "NTA  \n\nShe really, really needs to talk to someone, though. And it should be someone with a degree and experience--not trauma dumping on you. You gave her the reality of the situation, and that can be really important. Sometimes we need people to tell us straight up what we should hear. She seems attached to this to a toxic degree.", "NTA. It\u2019s really unfortunate that your mom never moved on, but that has nothing to do with you. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to give her any comfort. Your the child. She\u2019s the parent.", "Info: Did your mom ever date or did she just hold out hope your dad would come around? Did your dad date or just stay single this entire time?", "Sometimes hard truths needed to be said. \n\nSounds like your mom never accepted the fact that your dad did not seem to want to build a life with her, and that the only thing that really tied him to her was you. \n\nShe needs to focus on her life and what she wants, instead of what she could have had with someone who did not want her like that. \n\nWhile it's hard to see your mother upset, and harder still to tell her something you know will hurt her in the moment, it needed to be said. Endulging her rants meant she would only keep having them, and remain stuck. \n\nNTA", "Nah your alr", "NTA it\u2019s not good for her to keep living like this, she needs to apply this energy into putting herself out there and finding herself a new person.

Might hear about her over on /JUSTNOMIL", "Nta.", "NTA man... your mom needs to grow up.", "NTA", "Mom still thinks she's in a relationship with Dad", "Right? I'm quite curious what her father did. If he was the type to treat her ambiguously, and so making her continue cling on the idea of them being together, or if he did stand firm in no relationship but woman is just too delulu.", ">She's been using you to fill that role, and that's really not fair to put on you.\n\nSo what you're saying is there is an asshole in this situation.", "I totally agree with this comment. The comment about the girlfriend stealing her life makes me think she has held out for 20+ years hoping ops dad would want her. It also makes me think that maybe her pregnancy with OP wasn't an accident, but her plan backfired when no real relationship formed between her and op's dad.\n\nOP'S not NTA and needs to move out or get mum in therapy.", "I don't live there, I visited for the holidays.", "She is parentifying OP by using him as her therapist, he is 100% justified in telling her to get lost.", "\"My dad keeps ranting about how my mom owes him love and a family, and that her new husband stole his life from him.\" \n\nThis statement comes off as creepy, possessive, and borderline abusive.\n\nWhy is it okay when it it's a woman doing it? Go watch Fatal Attraction, but imagine there was no affair.", "Do you not realize OP\u2019s parents broke up twenty years before the dad started dating Anne? Is 20 years not enough time to move on?", "They both dated, but my dad never once introduced me to anyone so it felt very sudden when he pursued Anne and married her.", "Thats what it all comes down to. OPs mom is acting like they're still in a relationship and that OPs dad is cheating on her. Shes delusional and needs help like...20 years ago.", "That's understandable. None of the other people he dated were good enough to meet you. The fact that he met, dated and married someone you like is a bit of a compliment to you, ensuring a good relationship.  \n\nAs for your mom, it sounds like your Dad finally marrying means she's realizing she spent years waiting for something to happen that never would. I feel badly for her, but she's had plenty of time to come to this realization and seek therapy for moving on, especially now that you're an adult.", "No, he says he doesn't think she has feelings for his dad.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191soa0/aita_for_telling_my_mother_to_move_on_and_find/kgydmmx/?context=3", "Per say.
