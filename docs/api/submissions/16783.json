She's 27 and I'm 26. Growing up we weren't exactly close but we were okay. We have a cousin Beth who is 27. My sister always saw her as a potential BFF and always wanted to hang out with her, but she was way too intense for Beth and was kinda stalkery around Beth. For example she requested a change in class schedule every year of high school a week in so they'd be in all the same classes, she wanted to join every extra curricular Beth did, if Beth was over at our house she'd make up a reason for our parents to let her walk Beth home, even when Beth didn't want to walk with her, she'd wait for her at her locker in school just to speak to her, she asked our parents to take her to a soft play area when she was younger because Beth was going to a party there. Stuff like that was constant. To make things worse Beth and I got along really well. My sister used to hate it and would insert herself into everything and attempt to push me out. More recently she invited Beth to be there when she had my nephew.\n\nNow my sister and I have babies 4 days apart in age. My sister and I chose names that are very different stylistically for our kids. She went with George for her son. My daughter is Lyric. I don't do a lot of social media but I do have an Instagram and Beth commented on the post where I announced my daughter's name saying how much she loved it, etc.\n\nThen a few weeks later we were all at our grandparents and Beth brought up my daughter's name and how she thought it fit her perfectly and was cute. My sister was so jealous. When my partner and I were leaving she asked me why the hell Beth liked my daughter's name so much and how come she never gushed about George the same was she did Lyric. She said she assumed that an Elizabeth who went by Beth would appreciate a strong, classic, royal name. I told her it was nothing to do with me. She told me I must have asked Beth what kind of names she liked when I was pregnant and that's why she was so in love with my daughter's name. She told me I always hogged Beth and that my daughter has a dumb name and she'll hate me.\n\nI could feel the jealousy rolling off her even without her saying that. But it made me realize how we need to keep our distance and I don't want my daughter subjected to that. Now my sister is suggesting that we do joint stuff with the kids. So like birthday parties and Easter parties and stuff. I was like no way are we doing that. She was saying it was perfect and I was being selfish and denying the cousins the chance to be close. I told her her jealousy and over the top reactions to it are why we're not doing joint stuff and that she is not going to get the chance to treat my daughter the way she treats me and is not going to ruin my daughter's special celebrations just because she's jealous that I get along with Beth.\n\nMy sister said I was being unfair, bullying her and punishing her for feeling left out which \"makes me an even bigger bitch\".

Lyric (beautiful name, btw) and George are cousins, and you never know, once they are old enough to enjoy  each other's company, they may end up being each other's Beth. But  until they are old enough to decide  for  themselves what kind of relationship they want, I'd be limiting contact with Auntie MeanSister to larger family gatherings, and be ready to calmly leave an event at the slightest sign of aggression from her.  If you don't mind, here's  a suggestion? When she starts up with the nobody likes me whine, react with polite disinterest as you pack up to leave,  telling her you no longer want to discuss her grievances. Stick to one phrase and just repeat it calmly as needed as you leave the event. You'll have to be tough the first dozen times or so, but consistent calm refusal to engage generally is effective and helps the whole family understand that abusive behaviour should not be tolerated.", "are you sure your sis doesnt want to f\\*\\*\\* with beth? this feels seriously romantically onsided \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you did it she would be mad but it would also put Beth in a bad situation. You are keeping your daughter safe by not letting her engage in your sisters toxic ass behavior. I would worry that she will spew this ideology onto George, taking away the potential for a good healthy relationship with the cousins. But he\u2019s not your circus. I would continue firm boundaries with tori sister for your family\u2019s sake", "She wants to do these joint events because she assumes - rightly or wrongly - that Beth will attend yours but not necessarily hers. \n\nHer obsession, and it is obsessive, is worrying to say the least. This is all about access to your cousin. \n\nNTA. You are stopping the abusive dynamic and not further allowing your sister's weirdness to continue on your watch.", "Wait. So your sister is so obsessed with Beth that when she hears that Beth likes your babies name she assumes that you *intentionally* quizzed Beth on names? \n\nSo you could name your child a name that Beth would like? So as to get closer to Beth and push your sister away?\n\nNot to mention if she modeled her own childs name on an assumption of what Beth would like...\n\nThat is not healthy attachment. Nobody in their right mind would even come up with that, much less think it is true and get upset about it.\n\nNTA and steer clear. That is some creepy stuff your sister has going on in her head.", "Your sister needs some kind of mental help.  She sounds unhinged. Ntah", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a piece of work. I bet she only wants joint celebrations so Beth will show up.", "Your sister is in love with Beth and needs to move on.\n\nNTA, go low contact to avoid as much of this weirdness as you can.", "NTA\n\nBut has nobody ever told your sister she's unhinged? Not Beth? Not you? Not your parents? Her partner? Teachers?", "Based on the information provided, it does not seem like you are the asshole in this situation. It appears that your sister has a history of being possessive and jealous, particularly when it comes to her relationship with Beth and her relationship with you. It also seems like her jealousy and overreactions have caused tension and problems in the past.  \nIn this specific situation, your sister's jealousy over Beth's compliment of your daughter's name and her assumption that you asked Beth what kind of names she liked when you were pregnant is unfounded and irrational. It is understandable that you do not want to subject your daughter to your sister's jealousy and overreactions.  \nWhile it is reasonable for your sister to want to have joint celebrations with your children, it is also reasonable for you to decline if you do not feel comfortable with the idea. It is not fair for your sister to expect you to put your daughter in a potentially uncomfortable situation just because she wants to spend time with her nephew.  \nIt is important to communicate your boundaries and concerns to your sister in a respectful and clear manner. It is also important for your sister to address and work on her jealousy issues, as they are causing strain in her relationships with others.", "So NTA and i personally think the name lyric is stupid lol", "NTA she sounds exhausting. Is she lonely? Does she have an other close girlfriends to lean on?", "NTA", "NTA she sounds like a wierdo. Lyric is a strange one i have never heard before but who am i to judge", "Whoa, she's totally obsessed with Beth. She wants to use you and your daughter to get close to Beth. It's been years and she's still obsessed with her. Both you and Beth should keep your distance. And make sure she doesn't bully your daughter. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour sisters lifelong obsession and fixation with Beth is pretty terrifying. And I\u2019m not surprised your parents played along with it. I\u2019m guessing your sister is the golden child of your family and can do no wrong - I can\u2019t imagine saying half the stuff she says and not getting slapped for it. \n\nTrust your gut, stay far away from her, and never subject your kid to that. Have you spoken to Beth about this too?", "I for one, want to know where the parents and/or guardians were when sister was in high school?\n\nThis should have been addressed when she was changing schedules, and it wasn\u2019t a now it\u2019s worse.  \n\nLady has a kid and she\u2019s still panting after Beth.", "I wouldn't be surprised if Beth eventually just goes NC with OPs sister. This is creepy behavior. Also, who tf gushes over the name George. I'm aware this is just one symptom of a much bigger problem, but COME ON. No offense to the George's of reddit, but it's a boring name. NTA and OP maybe could suggest therapy to her sister before things get worse", "Or she\u2019s going to try to force George and Lyric to be BFFs cousins regardless of if they like each other. Just like she did with Beth", "Yeah she\u2019s definitely projecting and clearly chose George for the reason she stated; she assumed that Beth, being named Elizabeth, would appreciate a \u201cstrong, classic, royal name.\u201d Imagine finding out your mother chose your name in an attempt to impress her stalk-victim. It\u2019s all kinds of messed up tbh.  \nShe seems to have modelled her entire personality around attempting to befriend Beth, became more and more unhinged the more it didn\u2019t work, which in turn made it work even less.  \nShe\u2019s clearly trying to have joint celebrations because she knows that Beth won\u2019t go to hers, but will to OP\u2019s. It\u2019s just another ploy to stalk this poor cousin.", "Ewwww imagine being jealous of the woman your brother f*cks\ud83e\udd22"]}
