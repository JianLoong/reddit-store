If you don't mind, here's  a suggestion? When she starts up with the nobody likes me whine, react with polite disinterest as you pack up to leave,  telling her you no longer want to discuss her grievances. Stick to one phrase and just repeat it calmly as needed as you leave the event. You'll have to be tough the first dozen times or so, but consistent calm refusal to engage generally is effective and helps the whole family understand that abusive behaviour should not be tolerated.", "are you sure your sis doesnt want to f\\*\\*\\* with beth? this feels seriously romantically onsided \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is understandable that you do not want to subject your daughter to your sister's jealousy and overreactions.  \nWhile it is reasonable for your sister to want to have joint celebrations with your children, it is also reasonable for you to decline if you do not feel comfortable with the idea. It is not fair for your sister to expect you to put your daughter in a potentially uncomfortable situation just because she wants to spend time with her nephew.  \nIt is important to communicate your boundaries and concerns to your sister in a respectful and clear manner.
