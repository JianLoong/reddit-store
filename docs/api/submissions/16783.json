She's 27 and I'm 26. Growing up we weren't exactly close but we were okay. We have a cousin Beth who is 27. My sister always saw her as a potential BFF and always wanted to hang out with her, but she was way too intense for Beth and was kinda stalkery around Beth. For example she requested a change in class schedule every year of high school a week in so they'd be in all the same classes, she wanted to join every extra curricular Beth did, if Beth was over at our house she'd make up a reason for our parents to let her walk Beth home, even when Beth didn't want to walk with her, she'd wait for her at her locker in school just to speak to her, she asked our parents to take her to a soft play area when she was younger because Beth was going to a party there. Stuff like that was constant. To make things worse Beth and I got along really well. My sister used to hate it and would insert herself into everything and attempt to push me out. More recently she invited Beth to be there when she had my nephew.\n\nNow my sister and I have babies 4 days apart in age. My sister and I chose names that are very different stylistically for our kids. She went with George for her son. My daughter is Lyric. I don't do a lot of social media but I do have an Instagram and Beth commented on the post where I announced my daughter's name saying how much she loved it, etc.\n\nThen a few weeks later we were all at our grandparents and Beth brought up my daughter's name and how she thought it fit her perfectly and was cute. My sister was so jealous. When my partner and I were leaving she asked me why the hell Beth liked my daughter's name so much and how come she never gushed about George the same was she did Lyric. She said she assumed that an Elizabeth who went by Beth would appreciate a strong, classic, royal name. I told her it was nothing to do with me. She told me I must have asked Beth what kind of names she liked when I was pregnant and that's why she was so in love with my daughter's name. She told me I always hogged Beth and that my daughter has a dumb name and she'll hate me.\n\nI could feel the jealousy rolling off her even without her saying that. But it made me realize how we need to keep our distance and I don't want my daughter subjected to that. Now my sister is suggesting that we do joint stuff with the kids. So like birthday parties and Easter parties and stuff. I was like no way are we doing that. She was saying it was perfect and I was being selfish and denying the cousins the chance to be close. I told her her jealousy and over the top reactions to it are why we're not doing joint stuff and that she is not going to get the chance to treat my daughter the way she treats me and is not going to ruin my daughter's special celebrations just because she's jealous that I get along with Beth.\n\nMy sister said I was being unfair, bullying her and punishing her for feeling left out which \"makes me an even bigger bitch\".

But  until they are old enough to decide  for  themselves what kind of relationship they want, I'd be limiting contact with Auntie MeanSister to larger family gatherings, and be ready to calmly leave an event at the slightest sign of aggression from her.  If you don't mind, here's  a suggestion? When she starts up with the nobody likes me whine, react with polite disinterest as you pack up to leave,  telling her you no longer want to discuss her grievances. Stick to one phrase and just repeat it calmly as needed as you leave the event. You'll have to be tough the first dozen times or so, but consistent calm refusal to engage generally is effective and helps the whole family understand that abusive behaviour should not be tolerated.", "are you sure your sis doesnt want to f\\*\\*\\* with beth? this feels seriously romantically onsided \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you did it she would be mad but it would also put Beth in a bad situation. You are keeping your daughter safe by not letting her engage in your sisters toxic ass behavior. I would worry that she will spew this ideology onto George, taking away the potential for a good healthy relationship with the cousins. But he\u2019s not your circus. I would continue firm boundaries with tori sister for your family\u2019s sake"]}
