If you don't mind, here's  a suggestion? When she starts up with the nobody likes me whine, react with polite disinterest as you pack up to leave,  telling her you no longer want to discuss her grievances. Stick to one phrase and just repeat it calmly as needed as you leave the event. You'll have to be tough the first dozen times or so, but consistent calm refusal to engage generally is effective and helps the whole family understand that abusive behaviour should not be tolerated.", "are you sure your sis doesnt want to f\\*\\*\\* with beth? this feels seriously romantically onsided \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is understandable that you do not want to subject your daughter to your sister's jealousy and overreactions.  \nWhile it is reasonable for your sister to want to have joint celebrations with your children, it is also reasonable for you to decline if you do not feel comfortable with the idea. It is not fair for your sister to expect you to put your daughter in a potentially uncomfortable situation just because she wants to spend time with her nephew.  \nIt is important to communicate your boundaries and concerns to your sister in a respectful and clear manner.

Is it really not enough for you to know that OP is concerned about her sister's behavior and doesn't want to expose her daughter to it? Does that not make sense to you or something?", "I am wondering the same thing. I feel awful for Beth because all the adults in her life failed to help her deal with this extremely bizarre and obsessive behavior.", "It *is* crazy. The sister is accusing OP of acting within what she herself thinks is natural and reasonable. She is projecting her own, less than normal and healthy, behavior onto OP.\n\nWhy else accuse someone of something so outlandish? An honest person expects others to be honest. A liar expects lies. I see the same pattern in OPs sisters' actions.", "> Also, who tf gushes over the name George.\n\nAbominable Snowman? \"I'm going to love him and hug him and squeeze him and call him George\"", "True, just bored so read this sub while waiting at a hospital for a friend. You are correct about too few words to explain and yet people go so strong with their opinions with so little info. The tone of the OP\u2019s writing made me lose my mind and actually hit the reply button.", "She is concerned about her sister\u2019s behavior. That is good. She probably got plenty of advice from this subreddit.", "Even if Beth were named I honor of the late Queen Elizabeth II, she should like the name George bc it's the Queen's great-grandson? Like her other favorite names are Louis, Charlotte, and Archie?? \ud83d\ude04", "Here it is, I was thinking the same thing! This way, Beth will definitely attend all of \"her\" family gatherings and birthdays and she will be able to keep clinging to her", "It\u2019s another example of getting the causality backward. \n\nA lot of people who are bad at relationships will look at the relationship they want to emulate and think \u201cthese people are close, and they do X thing, so if I do X thing with them, I\u2019ll be close with them too!\u201d The problem is that most of the time, X thing is a result of the closeness rather than the cause. So to everybody else it looks like this person is overstepping boundaries and making them uncomfortable, and now they\u2019re even less likely to want the closeness that this person is so desperate for."]}
