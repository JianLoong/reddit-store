I (f 30) let my niece (f 20) live in the basement of my house while she's in university until she can find a place of her own. I am married to my husband (m 30) and we have one child (f 3), we live in a decently large house with a full basement. At Christmas 2 years ago, my sister (f 45) announced that her daughter let's call \"Ella\" had been accepted to the university of her dreams. I just so happen to live a few bus stops away from this school, so naturally as a good aunt I decided to put the offer for her to live with us while she went to school there. I had a few conditions obviously, but nothing too \"over the top\".\n1. Pay rent, the rent isn't expensive either. It's a lot cheaper than most other places in our city.\n2. If she's going to be staying with us she needs to have a job, a plan to move out as soon as she's financially able.\n3. If she is having friends over she should make sure we're okay with it and just to keep her \"party\" decently quiet since we do have a toddler.\nTo be honest she was a pretty good tenant, she paid rent on time, she was an extremely good student, she even had dinner with us and offered to watch our daughter while we had date nights. Around her 20th birthday she got a bit more, irresponsible . She lost her job (which was a fairly well paying job) meaning she stopped paying all rents, she became a lot louder, which as a student I wouldn't be too concerned about but it was getting to the point where she would invite random people over for parties and the neighbours would call the police for the noise. I hit my limit when I found out she was kicked out of the school she worked so hard to get into. I called my sister to ask if she knew anything about all of this and she for some reason was angry and yelled,\n\"Who cares she's just living her life\" and hung up. As expected, I was furious so I did my little snooping and I called her old manager to figure out why she was fired, turns out she was dealing on the job. I have no idea why or where she would've gotten any of that but she did. I emailed the dean of the school she attended and apparently she just stopped showing to her classed and basically failed. I took it upon myself to talk to my husband and her father since my sister wanted nothing to do with any of this. I wrote up a little letter telling her she had to move out within 2 weeks or I'll be removing her stuff myself and she'll be basically homeless. The day of, her mother showed up to my door screaming at me and her daughter hadn't even packed anything up. My husband called the police and they removed her.  AITA\n\nEDIT: My apologies for not making this clear at all. I should\u2019ve mentioned that I have connection with the dean, nothing illegal was going on between us in any way. The dean of the school and I used to date in high school but we decided to be friends instead (not that this is important) but that\u2019s why we had been in contact. He knows my family and vice versa, which is the only reason I asked anything about her school issues. I had emailed him and we met for lunch, caught up then discussed the issue.

However you found out about the dealing - and I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have snooped that much but that\u2019s just me - you could be legally liable if the cops discover your house was being used, even unwittingly, as a place where people buy drugs. That right there would be reason enough for me to say \u201cnah, get the fuuuck out\u201d. The noise, too, is 100% your right to be sanctimonious about - it\u2019s your place after all, and while I haaaate some of that \u201cmy house my rules\u201d BS that comes out of, like, parents of older children, \u201cbe quiet so that I can sleep\u201d seems perfectly reasonable.

I\u2019d own up to that, even embrace it. Hell, it might even be a valuable life lesson for this person if not literally the wake up call that they need. This person needs to understand that not everyone is going to be Mr. and Mrs. Polite when they are an absolute as. And from your perspective, it\u2019s 100% okay to be an asshole to protect yourself and your family. Sometimes you even have to be an unruly asshole who won\u2019t listen to \u201creason\u201d. At the end of the day, I think it\u2019s important to define these things because I feel like people confuse \u201cwanting to be a good person\u201d with \u201cnot wanting to be a dick to anybody\u201d and you wind up backsliding and putting yourself into a position that helps nobody because deep down, in the back of your mind, you know you\u2019re being an asshole on some level and you feel like that in and of itself is wrong.", "ESH.

Most had pro vice chancellors or similar. I do know that PVCs get 100k+ in the UK, a number of colleagues are in (or were in) such positions. Sadly, I'm not that established so quite happy as a Senior Lecturer for the time being - plus I quite enjoy research and teaching and being a PVC/Dean is almost entirely admin/management. I also no longer work in the UK, so who knows - maybe it's changed significantly in the last few years and there's been a shift back to Deans instead of PVCs. Finally, I probably am pretty pathetic - but my student feedback for my teaching is pretty good so not too worried on that front (though I have countless other shortcomings)", "If not you down voting, I apologise for even asking. Someone else not enjoying the truth then.\n\nAs for Deans, I remember Deans from the 1980s and 1990s. When you said there weren\u2019t many, I thought I would check.  Yes, Deans are generally entirely admin related, that I know. I don\u2019t think Durham have Deans. Some of the colleges at Oxford and at Cambridge don\u2019t have Deans either.", "I was in a very similar situation at about the same age as your niece. I was a good kid, good student, never caused problems or got in trouble\u2026took a gap year after high school to \u201cfigure out what I wanted to do in college\u201d and moved out of state and lived with my cousin who was newly married with a 3 yr old. Long story short I started hanging out with the wrong people and while I was legally an adult I was clearly not ready to be living as one and ended up addicted to heroin at age 19. You are most definitely NTA. While I am absolutely not blaming anyone but myself for my situation, none of my family said anything or got involved or held me to the rules and responsibilities I had agreed to, and if they had it may have been enough to stop me from following the path that my \u201cfriends\u201d were on. Your number one priority has to be the safety and happiness of your child and husband. You did the absolute right thing by kicking her out of your house. I feel guilty to this day about having and being on drugs in my cousin\u2019s home that put her family in danger. Anything could have happened, police raid, robbery, accidental ingestion, even CPS involvement if any of these things would have happened. I was too young and naive at the time to even realize I was putting anyone, even myself, in danger. And I promise you this, there is no way ur niece is just selling drugs and not also doing them. She had a good job and a secure place to live, she would not take the risk to make some quick cash if she didn\u2019t have to. She is dealing to support her own drug use because drugs get real expensive real quick when u are in way over ur head and don\u2019t have the foresight and life experience to stop yourself. In no way are you obligated or responsible to do anything more than kick her out of your house as she is legally an adult now, but it might make a huge difference if u do. I wish my family would have confronted me and kicked me out and told my parents, it may have been what I needed to wake up. At the very least it would have made it extremely difficult for me to keep doing drugs and living a secret life that I had no idea how to navigate. Tell your niece\u2019s parents everything you know, however keep in mind parental denial can be very strong and they may not be willing or able to admit to themselves that this is going on with their daughter. It sounds like this is what happened when u tried to talk to your niece\u2019s mom about it. Don\u2019t take it personally, she lashed out at you because of denial, it\u2019s hard for a parent to hear their child is going down such a dangerous path and not feel guilty that they didn\u2019t parent well enough to prevent this. Tell your sister you understand how hard it is for her to hear this about her daughter and that it\u2019s not her fault. My parents were absolutely amazing and I had a wonderful childhood and still ended up an addict. Addiction knows no race, color, creed, socioeconomic status, etc. It\u2019s a disease that can sink it\u2019s deadly teeth into any human being given the opportunity. However, now your sister knows what is going on with her daughter and needs to come to terms with it quickly because denial kills and the longer this goes on the harder it is going to be for your niece to stop. Talk to your niece and tell her that you know about the drugs. Tell her you want to support her but you won\u2019t support her drug problem. If she tells you it\u2019s not a problem and she has it under control or was just experimenting or whatever, don\u2019t fall for it, she may be in denial that she has a problem as well or may not even understand enough about addiction to know that she is addicted (as was my case). I was addicted for a good 3 years before I even fully realized it and was so ashamed and afraid of disappointing my parents that I managed to silently struggle and kept it secret for about 7 years before I was forced to come clean to them about it. And once they finally knew I was able to stop letting this shameful secret control all my choices and I was able to go get help. You never know what might be the thing that will get through to someone and your niece needs something to get through and snap her out of this before she loses the ability to choose for herself and the addiction chooses for her.", "NTA", "Nta if she was dealing at work.
