I (f 30) let my niece (f 20) live in the basement of my house while she's in university until she can find a place of her own. I am married to my husband (m 30) and we have one child (f 3), we live in a decently large house with a full basement. At Christmas 2 years ago, my sister (f 45) announced that her daughter let's call \"Ella\" had been accepted to the university of her dreams. I just so happen to live a few bus stops away from this school, so naturally as a good aunt I decided to put the offer for her to live with us while she went to school there. I had a few conditions obviously, but nothing too \"over the top\".\n1. Pay rent, the rent isn't expensive either. It's a lot cheaper than most other places in our city.\n2. If she's going to be staying with us she needs to have a job, a plan to move out as soon as she's financially able.\n3. If she is having friends over she should make sure we're okay with it and just to keep her \"party\" decently quiet since we do have a toddler.\nTo be honest she was a pretty good tenant, she paid rent on time, she was an extremely good student, she even had dinner with us and offered to watch our daughter while we had date nights. Around her 20th birthday she got a bit more, irresponsible . She lost her job (which was a fairly well paying job) meaning she stopped paying all rents, she became a lot louder, which as a student I wouldn't be too concerned about but it was getting to the point where she would invite random people over for parties and the neighbours would call the police for the noise. I hit my limit when I found out she was kicked out of the school she worked so hard to get into. I called my sister to ask if she knew anything about all of this and she for some reason was angry and yelled,\n\"Who cares she's just living her life\" and hung up. As expected, I was furious so I did my little snooping and I called her old manager to figure out why she was fired, turns out she was dealing on the job. I have no idea why or where she would've gotten any of that but she did. I emailed the dean of the school she attended and apparently she just stopped showing to her classed and basically failed. I took it upon myself to talk to my husband and her father since my sister wanted nothing to do with any of this. I wrote up a little letter telling her she had to move out within 2 weeks or I'll be removing her stuff myself and she'll be basically homeless. The day of, her mother showed up to my door screaming at me and her daughter hadn't even packed anything up. My husband called the police and they removed her.  AITA\n\nEDIT: My apologies for not making this clear at all. I should\u2019ve mentioned that I have connection with the dean, nothing illegal was going on between us in any way. The dean of the school and I used to date in high school but we decided to be friends instead (not that this is important) but that\u2019s why we had been in contact. He knows my family and vice versa, which is the only reason I asked anything about her school issues. I had emailed him and we met for lunch, caught up then discussed the issue.

However you found out about the dealing - and I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have snooped that much but that\u2019s just me - you could be legally liable if the cops discover your house was being used, even unwittingly, as a place where people buy drugs. That right there would be reason enough for me to say \u201cnah, get the fuuuck out\u201d. The noise, too, is 100% your right to be sanctimonious about - it\u2019s your place after all, and while I haaaate some of that \u201cmy house my rules\u201d BS that comes out of, like, parents of older children, \u201cbe quiet so that I can sleep\u201d seems perfectly reasonable. And like for all their yelling at you, why aren\u2019t her own parents taking her in?\n\nBut I mean, you\u2019re absolutely being an AH for tossing her out onto the street. I\u2019d own up to that, even embrace it. Hell, it might even be a valuable life lesson for this person if not literally the wake up call that they need. This person needs to understand that not everyone is going to be Mr. and Mrs. Polite when they are an absolute as. And from your perspective, it\u2019s 100% okay to be an asshole to protect yourself and your family. Sometimes you even have to be an unruly asshole who won\u2019t listen to \u201creason\u201d. At the end of the day, I think it\u2019s important to define these things because I feel like people confuse \u201cwanting to be a good person\u201d with \u201cnot wanting to be a dick to anybody\u201d and you wind up backsliding and putting yourself into a position that helps nobody because deep down, in the back of your mind, you know you\u2019re being an asshole on some level and you feel like that in and of itself is wrong.", "ESH.

She's (supposedly) an adult, and she didn't live up to her part of the bargain.", "Nta.\n\nShe broke allllll the rules. Idk why her mom was so mad? Niece was living there to be close to school, since she dropped out she should have moved home immediately especially with no job and not being able to pay rent. I'm guessing your sister doesn't want her there either? She sucks.", "ESH, two weeks is too short of a notice, it might be legal but legal does not mean moral and this sub is for morality not legality.\n\nShe sucks for lying to you and not upholding the agreement.", "Especially since she got kicked out of uninso there was no point of her living at aunties house", "I wouldn't want a drug dealer around my children either.\n\nHard pass.\n\nYour sister was probably ashamed, which is why she yelled at you.\n\nUnderstandable, but still assholish behaviour.\n\nYou are definitely NOT THE ASSHOLE.", "And the drug dealer couldn't even pay rent, which means it was going up her nose.", "Dealing drugs and the cops have been called on multiple occasions? Completely NTA.\n\nI think there is something else going on, though. Going from model student/tenant to drug dealer who quits school?", "And she wouldn\u2019t have known had she not inquired with her boss.\n\nI would\u2019ve called too, perhaps if only to cover my bases about kicking her out. \nOne Reddit mom found that her daughter was actually being, essentially, forced into \u201clabor\u201d at her restaurant by an ott boss who was abusive and withholding money from tips. \nAnother business owner found out a supervisor was sexually harassing female customers and employees which is why the turnover rate sucked. \n\nBasically, I\u2019d want to know if she quit or was fired for reasons that shouldn\u2019t be held against her. \n\nI\u2019d also feel terrible if the university classes fell through due to something out of her control (perhaps a mental health issue or crisis that I could help navigate)\n\n\nIf op came here and was like \u201cyep I told her to get out bc \u2018you don\u2019t work, you quit college, and had an escalation in risky behavior and that\u2019s not the deal\u201d then people would be upset that she didn\u2019t do enough. \n\nSo she makes sure this is just her niece being a freeloading kumquat and suddenly she\u2019s too nosy. \n\nReddit gives me whiplash with its ever changing standards and stipulations for everyday life. \ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udee3", "Also, calling the manager of her old job and getting info on why she was fired? Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhm, am I the only person raising my eyebrows that an employer gives information like that to a random third party?", "she could move back in with her parents.  This was temp housing while she was in school.  Even if she was made homeless that is better than chancing a 3-year-old getting into her drug stash.", "Wonder if she is dealing as well.", "I think the mum/sister was yelling because she didn't want to take responsibility for her child. When she's living with OP it doesn't have to be her problem.", "I really doubt the niece signed anything. Op says she's friends with the dean.", "OP also states she's not in the US, so FERPA does not apply.", "Ahh, so you're a failure as a parent and are projecting.", "I still doubt the niece signed anything", "Op isn't in the USA. She says so in the post", "Now. It\u2019s clearly in an edit, it was added after the post was made. At the time of my original comment the edit was not there. Hence my edit to my original comment and my acknowledgment of that in this comment."]}
