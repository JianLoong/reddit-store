I (f 30) let my niece (f 20) live in the basement of my house while she's in university until she can find a place of her own. I am married to my husband (m 30) and we have one child (f 3), we live in a decently large house with a full basement. At Christmas 2 years ago, my sister (f 45) announced that her daughter let's call \"Ella\" had been accepted to the university of her dreams. I just so happen to live a few bus stops away from this school, so naturally as a good aunt I decided to put the offer for her to live with us while she went to school there. I had a few conditions obviously, but nothing too \"over the top\".\n1. Pay rent, the rent isn't expensive either. It's a lot cheaper than most other places in our city.\n2. If she's going to be staying with us she needs to have a job, a plan to move out as soon as she's financially able.\n3. If she is having friends over she should make sure we're okay with it and just to keep her \"party\" decently quiet since we do have a toddler.\nTo be honest she was a pretty good tenant, she paid rent on time, she was an extremely good student, she even had dinner with us and offered to watch our daughter while we had date nights. Around her 20th birthday she got a bit more, irresponsible . She lost her job (which was a fairly well paying job) meaning she stopped paying all rents, she became a lot louder, which as a student I wouldn't be too concerned about but it was getting to the point where she would invite random people over for parties and the neighbours would call the police for the noise. I hit my limit when I found out she was kicked out of the school she worked so hard to get into. I called my sister to ask if she knew anything about all of this and she for some reason was angry and yelled,\n\"Who cares she's just living her life\" and hung up. As expected, I was furious so I did my little snooping and I called her old manager to figure out why she was fired, turns out she was dealing on the job. I have no idea why or where she would've gotten any of that but she did. I emailed the dean of the school she attended and apparently she just stopped showing to her classed and basically failed. I took it upon myself to talk to my husband and her father since my sister wanted nothing to do with any of this. I wrote up a little letter telling her she had to move out within 2 weeks or I'll be removing her stuff myself and she'll be basically homeless. The day of, her mother showed up to my door screaming at me and her daughter hadn't even packed anything up. My husband called the police and they removed her.

Change your locks, and be prepared for some of her associates to show up.", "NTA. Your sister failed your niece.", "NTA, it\u2019s *your* house. She\u2019s *not* your kid, not *your* problem. Your niece is trash, and your sister is even bigger trash for not reigning her in", "nta - however, your niece is young and obviously there is something happening that is causing her to fall off the wagon (not saying it isn\u2019t her own doing.) some people have to learn the hard way and unfortunately it seems to be the case for you niece. however, does she have alternative living options? also, check local laws and make sure you evict her correctly if she will not leave willingly. best of luck on your endeavors with this situation", "ESH - if it were my niece I'd try to talk to her instead of this heavy handed 'punishment.' What if something happened? A sudden change in behavior can be associated with a traumatic event, why didn't you ask her what was going on? You went behind her back and snooped on her life while not having a convo with her directly.", "Obviously NTA. Why would you even think it\u2019s close. I don\u2019t believe you told us everything to the story because no grown rational mother would act how hers did unless she too is on heavy drugs.

Definitely NTA by the definition the sub gives to \u201casshole\u201d but let\u2019s be truly honest here: you\u2019re being an asshole but you\u2019re also completely justified in being one. However you found out about the dealing - and I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have snooped that much but that\u2019s just me - you could be legally liable if the cops discover your house was being used, even unwittingly, as a place where people buy drugs. That right there would be reason enough for me to say \u201cnah, get the fuuuck out\u201d. The noise, too, is 100% your right to be sanctimonious about - it\u2019s your place after all, and while I haaaate some of that \u201cmy house my rules\u201d BS that comes out of, like, parents of older children, \u201cbe quiet so that I can sleep\u201d seems perfectly reasonable. And like for all their yelling at you, why aren\u2019t her own parents taking her in?\n\nBut I mean, you\u2019re absolutely being an AH for tossing her out onto the street. I\u2019d own up to that, even embrace it. Hell, it might even be a valuable life lesson for this person if not literally the wake up call that they need. This person needs to understand that not everyone is going to be Mr. and Mrs. Polite when they are an absolute as. And from your perspective, it\u2019s 100% okay to be an asshole to protect yourself and your family. Sometimes you even have to be an unruly asshole who won\u2019t listen to \u201creason\u201d. At the end of the day, I think it\u2019s important to define these things because I feel like people confuse \u201cwanting to be a good person\u201d with \u201cnot wanting to be a dick to anybody\u201d and you wind up backsliding and putting yourself into a position that helps nobody because deep down, in the back of your mind, you know you\u2019re being an asshole on some level and you feel like that in and of itself is wrong.", "ESH. Obviously she\u2019s an asshole. But YWBTA if you didn\u2019t follow the tenant laws in your state.
