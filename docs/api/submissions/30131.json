We've met friends for dinner with him and have sat outside on the patio. They've always known in advance he was coming and were fine with it.

You're not telling us the whole story.\n\nIs the dog unruly? Does it jump on you or lick you? Is it untrained and annoying? Because I know friends who have dogs like that, and it can be a bit much when the dog is all over you. \n\nBut you don't mention anything about the dog's behavior in your post. Just that it EXISTS. That it's (gasp) in YOUR VICINITY. The nerve.\n\nThis is a 'you' thing. And it's making you an asshole and creating rifts in your friendships.

So, I guess say goodbye to your friends with dogs.", "People sometimes don't use any common sense. We had a neighbor that didn't understand why we told him to take his dog home from our outdoor bbq.

Are we really saying that you shouldn't have to make small sacrifices such as, tolerating a dog's existence for a few hours, for the sake of your friend..? Wild..", "I'm going to be in the minority, and say YTA. If it's nice outside, you could've easily just sat outside and barely even acknowledged the dog. They're calmer than kids the vast majority of the time. None of you have an allergy. You just decided to throw a temper tantrum over nothing.", "YTA. I get it if you didn\u2019t wanna sit outside because it was too cold or something but I can\u2019t imagine a dog lying at the owners feet and possibly annoy you that much. \n\nAnd I also dislike dogs. I don\u2019t like them slobbering, I don\u2019t like their nose in my crotch, I don\u2019t like to constantly be bothered by them, and I especially don\u2019t want to constantly correct them, but I tolerate them occasionally for the sake of social interaction.", "NTA. I absolutely love dogs. But please don't bring them unannounced to restaurants with other people.\n\nI, for one, do not want to be watched the whole meal while I can feel even a well trained dog attempting jedi mind tricks thinking \"feed me human food, human food feed me, I want that human food, why oh why must I resist the human food\" along with being almost painfully cute with the puppy eyes while I take bite after bite. I feel like I'm teasing even the best trained dog by sitting and eating in front of it like that while he sits and quietly drools for food that may not even be good for him. \n\nDogs aren't people, you need to meet them where they are and take their nature into account. It's normal for them to be food-obsessed, and it's normal for them to desperately want the food even if they know they can't have it. There's no need to make them sit while they see and smell human food while knowing they can't get any. Leave the pup by himself for a bit, you aren't doing your dog a favor by making him so anxiously attached that he can't chill by himself for an hour or two. Keep them away from the tempting human food smell and come home and give them healthy dog treats and attention later. They'll be more happy chilling on the couch or playing in their fenced yard than sitting and watching all the humans eat insanely good smelling stuff. Seriously. Plus dogs shed and drool and while adorable are not the most hygienic animal, and it's not very sanitary for them to be around human food unnecessarily nor is it necessary to bring the dog around humans you know won't like them when the dog is used to people who faun over him and doesn't get why they're being snubbed. It's great to love your animals as family. But you should still be taking into account the differences in their needs and desires from that of humans and act accordingly.", "YTA. They didn\u2019t bring a dog to your house, they didn\u2019t bring a dog to your place of work. They didn\u2019t bring a dog to your event.

Just let those friends go. You're allowed to feel however you want about dogs but they are also allowed to bring their dog wherever it's allowed. If being around a dog at all is a deal breaker for you and leaving their dog home is a deal breaker for them then you guys just aren't compatible. \n\nI also think you handled this terribly. You could have suffered through one dinner and informed them that in the future you would prefer they just cancel plans if the dog can't be left home. I personally couldn't be friends with someone who acted this way. It would be one thing if it was an out of control dog but you couldn't handle just being in the same vicinity for a couple hours?", "ESH mostly them for bringing the dog.  A dog can stay home on its own for a few hours, and if you are so vehemently anti-dog and they know it, they should have asked you ahead of time.  \n\nBut I think ditching them, trying to get a separate table, and then leaving was a bit much.  I can understand not wanting pets or wanting to be around them, but maybe sitting outside near a well behaved dog would have been ok?", "yes, YTA.", "NTA. Dogs don't need a \"sitter\" when you're only going out for a few hours. Bringing a dog to dinner is a terrible idea.", "NTA. And LOL to a dog sitter for a dinner out. That's not a thing.", "YTA\n\nIdc if I get downvoted lol. If you have no allergies and the dog is well-behaved and quiet, what\u2019s the big deal? You can sit there and eat dinner and barely notice it\u2019s there. Actually, it\u2019s probably better behaved than babies/kids are at dinner", "Nta. My family is a dog family, but we would never take our dog with us to dinner, unless we're on an overnight trip and couldn't find a dog sitter available for the night. And even then, we would make sure to let other parties involved know about the issue, and come up with a plan that benefits everyone. Heck, even in my own home we do this. We have some family friends who don't like dogs who jump. And our dog used to jump a lot, so when they came over for dinner, we would have him in his crate or tied up elsewhere. The issue would be when he would bark nonstop and it started affecting everyone's ears. Since those friends specified their needs, we were like slowly letting our dog be free again in his home and made sure he didn't jump on anyone, and those family friends started liking our dog over time because he would be calm if they were also calm. It got easier as he got past being 2 yrs old. Then we have friends who are allergic to dogs, severely. We try cleaning up the house, inform them there may be some fur so they keep their medications and epi pens on them, and then keep our dog inside his crate. Same for those who fear dogs. My point here is, for our friends who COMPLETELT DISLIKE/are allergic to dogs, we accommodate them.", "I just went out for my birthday last week and, gasp, left the dogs home.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

But again these are general guidelines, and people should just know their dogs. \n\nI get that OP doesn't like dog. But I feel like OP was missing some info here.\n\nINFO: Were they going out to dinner on a day that both the friends had worked a full day? How old is the dog? Is the dog typically well behaved? These factors make a huge difference for my judgement.", "I grew up with dogs. Dogs were left at home during the day with a usual amount of food and water.

They had toys they were allowed to destroy as desired and people giving lots of daily playtime and walks.\n\nTaking dogs everywhere has gotten out of hand.", "I don't consider a dog with severe separation anxiety a healthy dog. Hopefully that's getting worked on", "Usually it's a lot more measured than...whatever the heck this is, though. You often have people who like dogs weighing in but also being sensitive to the fact that dogs need to be well trained, etc. But this just seems like the anti dog brigade!", "And that's certainly your opinion.\n\nWhy ruin a nice evening with friends, when you can just bring your dog with you, who sits still while you enjoy your time?", "You're just assuming his friend is aware of OP not liking dogs this much. For all we know, he doesn't.\n\nAnd you assumed they came in early on purpose just to mess with OP, when that's probably not the case.\n\nThey probably went out with the dog, and ended up there early.\n\nYou can choose to make worst case scenarios to excuse op's childish reaction, but more often than not, that's all it is, a childish reaction.\n\n\"right back at me\" when I didn't even tell you that initially.\nLol, main character syndrome, huh?", "Shit happens every day.\n\nI can die in traffic, get mugged on the street, get beaten up by a gang, a big earthquake can cause havoc, list is long.\n\nLiving in fear and destroying friendships over small chances of something happening is not the way to live.", "This isn't about who has more likes, my man.\n\nThis is about my opinion, and how it's not a weird one by any standards, if it's appreciated by 700 people who have the same train of thought.\n\nIf it was -700 then maybe I'd think that I have weird standards.\n\nJust to explain the obvious.", "We don't know exactly what the friend knows. As OP put it, his friends just know \"dogs are not his thing\", not that he runs away from dogs like the plague, lol", "Yikes.\n\nNo, trust me, in the real world, with mature people, it's not.\n\nMaybe among children it is, as they're easily offended and like to throw tantrums.\n\nBut otherwise, no.

I love them both to bits and hate that the old owners screwed her up so bad", "I've had dogs my entire life, and not once have I had a dog that couldn't be trusted to be alone.
