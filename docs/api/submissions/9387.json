We're getting married in a few months and my current OBGYN suggested we start trying now since \"it won't actually happen for a while\". WELL! We started taking ovulation tests. The first two months I didn't ovulate, as expected. But last month (January) I thought I ovulated but wasn't really sure. This morning we got a faint positive, but a positive nonetheless. I don't know how we managed to conceive our first real try after 4 doctors and I don't even know how many tests said we couldn't. But we did. We obviously know what can go wrong so we're excited but also terrified. Fianc\u00e9 and I agreed we'd keep it between us and 3 friends we agreed on. One of those friends was my friend \"R\". We've been best friends for 14 years. \n\n\"R\" is \\*very\\* childfree. Which is fine. I would never expect him to babysit or go out of his way to play with my children. But I do expect some decency. If the kid comes up to you and says \"Do you like my picture?\" be nice and say yes kind of vibe. R knows how I feel about children and how upset the PCOS. made me. He knows what PCOS is and what the risks and challenges are. When I told him he said \"Oh? There's still plenty of opportunity for something to go wrong.\" and I said \"Yeah...we know...just trying to be excited while we can...\" and he said \"You could just get a puppy.\" And I didn't answer. \n\nMy other best friend \"M\" says IWBTA if I said something to him. She says he's childfree and I can't expect him to \"change\" because I'm having a baby. She also said after all these years of friendship I can't be that caught off guard. I don't think I'm asking I'm to change anything. I'm not expecting him to babysit or change diapers or feed the baby or anything. But a little support? Sympathy? Kindness? I don't think that's asking him to suddenly love children. Technically, sort of, in a way, there's not even a child yet. I'm 12 days past ovulation. I don't even think there's a yolk in the yolk sac at this point. So I'm really asking him to be nice to ME at this point. Although I would like to tell him that when we do have a child, whether that happens from this pregnancy or a different one, he needs to be nice and friendly towards the child. \n\nI want to say something like \"Listen, I know you don't want kids and that's fine. But this is crazy and scary and I would appreciate your support and good vibes. Not jokes about miscarrying so I can get a puppy. And then I have the baby I'm not expecting you to babysit or take care of the child, but I am expecting you to treat them like a human being and show them kindness and respect.\" Too much?

And I'm just sitting here waiting to lose this baby.

Because we haven't legally adopted him. (His mom just literally told me to get him when he was 3 days old because she \"couldn't do it anymore\". I'm thinking it was PPD. They've gotten better over the years so he does spend some time with them now, but it's a slow transition. So I just see R when cousin is with his parents.) So R should know having a kid won't effect our friendship. I mean this one might be around a little more because he won't have every other weekend with other parents.

(not sure I should use that word here) enough to actually get diagnosed with PCOS before we were ready for a baby. So I had time to be told by 4 different doctors (2 gynos, 2 primary) and more tests than I can count that I wouldn't get pregnant. I actually have an appointment with an endocrinologist tomorrow, which was supposed to be for learning more about my hormones so we could have a better idea on what medications I'd need. He saw me sob and sob and sob and have panic attacks over it. I mean maybe he thinks that's all magically erased because I got pregnant on the first try. And I know I'm lucky. I'm so lucky I still don't even think it really sank in. Even if God forbid this doesn't stick. I can get pregnant. We know that now. Awesome. But that does not erase the sheer terror I felt at the thought of not conceiving.", "Oof. I didn't think about needing to go to him for mom struggles, but you're right. He's one of my go-to's because he is so good at helping me organize my thoughts and process my feelings. That's why he was one of our \"tell immediately people\". So I'm bound to want to go to him with mom struggles. Which I know are normal  and will always happen no matter how badly you wanted children.", "Yeah, the miscarriage joke has me a little shook. I'm not the silent treatment type but I had to stop answering once that sunk in.", "I never really thought about it that way. I need to rethink how I'll word things than. \n\nThank you so much. <3 I'm currently having an internal battle between \"just pretend you're not so when it goes bad you won't be as upset\" and \"enjoy it while you can\".", "I do think waiting for another comment would make what I have to say feel less \"attacky\" too.", "I mean, if this isn't the most accurate comment on all of Reddit.

When I was officially diagnosed I held it together in the office and then lost it in the parking lot. It was so bad 2 people stopped and asked if I was okay. (I had to go alone too because of Covid.) And I swear I've cried every day since. But you do eventually get used to it, just like when someone passes away. I'd recommend starting out with the cheapy ovulation tests, we used Pregmate, just to get a feel for your cycle. Then invest in Mira. It's $200 for the machine and it'll run you about $80 a month for the tests. But the more you know your cycle the less tests you'll need because you'll be able to zone in on when you should be testing. But it's really like having a mini lab in your home. I'm not sure what's wrong so I don't know if you'll get pregnant without medical intervention, but knowing your cycle would still help the doctors make the medical interventions more successful. \n\nThose are some REAL friends you have.", "Maybe? I don't know what that is. Lol", "You're my first congratulations!!! :') Thank you!! You know R's response. M just screamed. Legend has it she's still screaming. (Happy screaming.) And my other friend is a nurse so she just started giving me vitamins to take and what to ask my doctor for. Haha \n\nOof! What?! Someone once told me having a child was the most selfish thing you could do because there is no reason to have a biological child that doesn't start with \"I\" or \"we\". I sat and thought for DAYS and she was right. But I don't think you have to keep it a selfish situation. (And either way to call someone selfish for having a baby is WILD! SO inappropriate. She's a foster parent so I guess it's just a sore sport for her. And \"narcissistic\" makes no sense. That's a whole mental illness she accused you of.) I realize life sucks and this child only exists because I had sex. And now they have to deal with heartbreak and taxes and work and bills and school and bullies and all that other bad stuff. But I will make sure their life is so fucking amazing that they don't even care about the other crap. And, your friend can sleep well knowing that we'll teach them to recycle too. We also plant trees all the time because I like trees. Ugh. I'm sorry you went through that. I don't understand these toxic people either.", "I'm so sorry. His comments are cruel, almost as if they are specifically targeted to hurt you, and you have every right to be upset with him.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you with this pregnancy. My sister also has PCOS but managed to have two kids naturally, so it's not hopeless. Wishing you the best!", "He honestly doesn't sound like much of a friend at this point. It's almost like he's wishing you to miscarry so his childlessness won't somehow be inconvenienced. You're anxious enough about this, maybe stay away from him until he cuts the crap and apologizes.", "I have PCOS too and I read plenty of stories about women with PCOS conceiving naturally. Even my grandma, who also had it, was able to have my dad. Make sure you get tested, it has greater risk of gestational diabetes. I wish you the best of lucks.", "Yeah, he doesn't have to be \"nice\", but he can keep his damn yap shut if he wants to stay friends.", "Many boundaries are usually implied.

In the spectrum of bigotry it is most closely aligned with ableism, because just about every complaint that can be made about children can also be wielded against certain disabled adults.\n\nThe thing is, anti-child people don't actually want children to stop being born. They don't want to not have any entry-level workers in 20 years. They don't want to be 90 years old when the last healthcare worker alive just retired. They just want those future people to be born and raised in some manner\u2014in their unformed fantasies\u2014in which they are not affected or bothered by the inconvenience of crying babies or dirty diapers, even if they are never asked to personally provide any care.\n\nSo as you enter parenthood you will find that there are two kinds of people in your social circle who choose to not move into the parenthood phase themselves.\n\nOne kind will be the ones who are thrilled and supportive but say \"parenthood is not for me\" for any reasons they choose. (I'm better as an auntie, I'm not good with kids, health concerns, infertility they don't want to fight, etc. etc.) Of THOSE people some will be super excited and involved with your baby journey and support you the whole way, while others will say, count me out of the kid-centric stuff but I wish you well and I am still a friend to your adult non-parent persona if and when she is available.\n\nBut the other kind are the ones like \\*R\\* who dismiss what you're going through and compare babies to pets. These are the people who vote to underfund education because \"I don't have kids\" and then complain 20 years later when they can't get a doctor's appointment. They will tell you it is selfish of you to be 15 minutes late to work after you were up all night cleaning the remnants of a stomach flu off the walls.\n\nThey cannot be a friend to parents. And if it makes it easier for you, they are going to exit your life as soon as your baby is born because they find it too annoying, so you can just choose to accelerate the process and dismiss them from your circle now.\n\nBest of luck to you and I hope for improvement or at least steadiness with the PCOS and TTC.

Kids are so gross. And so needy. And fucking weird. And oh my gosh EMBARASSING! It is not always an enjoyable time. But that time ends so fast. And he's about to lose me (his only friend, actually) forever over something that might mildly annoy him for a few years.

FUCK OFF!\" and now I'm worried it'll come out as stubborn as me. Pray for us. \ud83d\ude02 And congratulations!!", "Thank you!!", "Wow. That's a really really good point. PCOS is a chronic illness. I mean, it doesn't just effect fertility. I have other things physically wrong that effect my day to day life. And I did work my ass off to get here. I mean, the pregnancy only took one try. But I just lost 50lbs which I'm sure helped. That's hard when nothing is wrong, it's even harder with PCOS.", "Thank you!!", "Oh my goodness I didn't even think about that.", "The funny thing is that all R's hobbies are technically \"kids activities\" he plays kid-friendly video games and is obsessed with Legos and Star Wars. (No judgment, those are all cool things.) So it would be so easy for him to get along with a kid. No one likes changing diapers or dealing with a crying infant, so obviously I wouldn't ask him to do that. To be fair, I wouldn't even ask my friends who are moms to do that. It's MY kid.", "Thank you so much for taking the time to type all that out!! Thankfully most of my friends are parents themselves and I know they'll be over the moon. The two that don't have kids are aunties who are obsessed with their nieces and nephews. (One is child free and one just hasn't met the right person yet.) You're 100% right about what you said though. And it's a good point what you said about disabled people. I never realized it before but you're right! I believe in 2nd chances, so I'm going to talk to R. After that if he blows it the friendship is over because it pretty much has to be at that point.", "For real!! If I lose the baby \\*I'm\\* the one that is physically and emotionally hurt. Me. His best friend. His ONLY friend. I'll suffer. The baby isn't going to feel it or understand what's happening.

NTA by the way OP.", ">want your friend to miscarry\n\nHow can she miscarry, the woman literally isn't pregnant yet. I'd be making jokes too if my mate started announcing stuff this early.

If he was your real bestie he would be happy for you because having a baby is a happy thing!!!!", "Thank you!!\nAnd congratulations to you as well!

Or accepting that you'll have to find different groups to be in that might not be as good as those you left behind.  \n\nAgain, I hope R comes around for his own sake. As someone who never wanted and would never want kids, I can get over myself enough to admit some of my best days and memories have been spent hanging out with my friend's kids... I hope he learns child free doesn't mean child hating, and that kids can actually add a certain variety and value to your life if you're just willing to be patient for them to get past the infant and toddler stages and to the age when they start to have interests of their own.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still shitting on someone when they\u2019d like a little support.

If you'd joke as well.. Y TA, so, yeah, I expect you wouldn't understand how to be a supportive friend who cared about their friend instead of being some child hating edge lord who wants the sick laugh about a puppy being better when you know your friend really wants a kid and has a positive test.

I would have even been fine if he said \"I'd prefer a puppy.\" It's the fact that he basically said he's hoping I miscarry and then just opt for a dog instead.", "That's a pretty good point.

It doesn't matter what the specific reason is; it could be buying a house or getting a promotion or learning a new skill or conquering a debilitating fear.

And, obviously, an AH.", ">It's the fact that he basically said he's hoping I miscarry and then just opt for a dog instead.\n\nYeah that\u2019s the part that pisses me off. Even if I disliked kids (I love them, I just don\u2019t want any) I could never see me saying something like that even as a joke.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m arachnophobic and exotic pet owners often get the type of spider that most makes me feel like I\u2019m in danger. If a friend of mine got one, I wouldn\u2019t be able to ever go their house and would be unable to talk about their pet much without symptoms. I\u2019d be completely unable to even look at pictures. I\u2018d STILL be happy for them to get the pet of their dreams and would never think to \u201cjoke\u201d about something bad happening to their pet. \n\nIf my phobia wouldn\u2019t prevent me from giving the most basic support and just being happy for my friend, his strong dislike is absolutely no excuse.", "I could settle for neutral.

Especially since he was 1 of 3 people we trusted with this news so early.", "Agreed, I'm childfree and I've crocheted/cross stitched gifts for all of my friends who have had babies. I don't want to watch the little buggers, but I'll celebrate with my friends because I want them to be happy. Then they celebrate with me when I do something insane on the other side of the spectrum that they don't understand lol", "Thank you! <3 And thank you for sharing your positive experiences! I feel dumb too honestly so I get what you're saying. We're prepared for a child, so we're excited. And we wouldn't have stopped using protection if we weren't open to the idea of a baby. But we thought we'd have a baby in a year or two, doctors said maybe longer. Now I'm sitting here like \"HoW dId ThIs HaPpEn!?\" like I don't know where babies come from and like we didn't track ovulation and have sex that day on purpose. \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you so much!", "And that's a fear that at least makes sense. I'm not sure if pet spiders can hurt you, but there are poisonous spiders out there. The odds a kid hurts you in pretty fucking low. Like what exactly is he scared of? It isn't contagious?", "Honestly a true friend wouldn't make jokes about miscarriage and say a puppy would make it better. No matter if he wants to be child-free he should be happy for you that you are having a child.

I'm just not sure why you chose to tell this friend....", "NTA, I have PCOS too and am almost 6 weeks with my first ever pregnancy. It's so scary being this excited and knowing something can still go wrong. Your friend is 100% TA for bringing it up as if you're not perfectly aware. You should be excited and I'm really happy for you and your little spark.", "NTA. He's gross. He's never going to be nice to you or your sweet baby. I'd be putting some distance between us, frankly, because that's not an attitude I'd want around my kids. Best wishes to you for a healthy pregnancy!", "YTA. Your making something about a baby that is not. It's about change.\n Your changing. Everything about you. They are feeling a loss. Give them time to process.", "You need new friends- NTA", "I don\u2019t think either one of you is TA, I just think you are looking for support in the wrong person. I\u2019m childfree as well and I just wouldn\u2019t be the best person for one of my friends to look for support in a situation like this. I just can\u2019t relate and obviously he can\u2019t either. I would have chosen to tell maybe other mom friends or friends that have kids.", "NTA.  Husband and I are childfree, and I endured lots of mostly well-intentioned questions about my lack of children when we were young enough to start a family.  Plus a campaign for grandchildren by my mother that lasted well over a decade and a half, and was anything but gracious.  I can't imagine turning all that negativity around and inflicting it on someone else who is choosing to have children.  You are absolutely within your rights to demand that your friend not be rude to you about your choice, and distance yourself from that person if they refuse to stop being rude.", "I'm childfree too and being childfree doesn't give you the right to be awful to or about kids. He's being terrible to you, especially with his nasty implications. NTA. Congratulations on your pregnancy! All the best to you and your partner, it's wonderful news!", "Absolutely NTA. I have several friends who are child free. They were supportive during my pregnancies and congratulated us. Not all of them want to interact with my kids(which is fine because I have 2 under 4 lol) but they have never been jerks or made assholes comments about anything in regards to my kids. \n\nYour friend is a giant asshole. He knows how big a positive test is for you. He knows how much you want this baby. The bare minimum was to congratulate you. He couldn\u2019t even bother to do that. And when you called him out he suggested you get a god damn puppy.", "OP\u2019s friend is an AH no doubt, but in NO WAY is he as bad as the KKK, like WTF???", "You knew how he was, and it's still VERY early. Like REALLY early. Not even a very dark line on the test. WHAT prompted you to share it with him, knowing how he feels? I'm not saying don't share, but should have waited till you're out of woods in my opinion. \n\nCongratulations btw. \n\nAnd a soft ESH.", "Such a gracious take. You've got this!", "Yes, and how they're raised, and the people they interact with, have a lot to do with what kind of adults they turn out to be. One of my docs had two kids, and when they were 4 and 6, she said they were finally getting to be interesting. She loves them dearly, but they're a handful for awhile. But, even as someone who'd be a terrible parent(which I would), it is fascinating to watch them grow up, and I've had a grand time being the \"evil auntie\" to my friends' children. I am truly sorry that your friend is being this way. It's his loss.", "If they're going to wish for a miscarriage? And hate children to the point that OP doesn't know if they can be civil to one? Sounds like someone who hates and rejoices in the demise of those they hate.

The most vulnerable protected class.\n\nAnd they're the worst of the worst.", "I thought it was a positive on an ovulation test? Maybe I misread", "That's what I thought as well.", "It is not that hard to be supportive of friends. He just let his true colors show. It is more important what he thinks of a subject than what you feel. \n\nAnd it is not that hard to be supportive.

M for going on about you wanting to change R when that is not true and R for having no compassion at all. They are supposed to be supportive and caring, they are not. I really hope things work out for you but in the meantime stay away from those two, you don't need their misery to mess with your mental wellbeing.", "Save yourself trouble cut off the friendship now he's just going to get worse and you'll see that his feelings don't only extend to other people they extend to you and your family. NTA but I wouldn't bring it up with him just slowly reduce communication if not go full nuclear and just ignore them", "NTA I am very child free. I\u2019m good with the three to four year old range and higher, but babies scare me. Two of my coworkers just had babies, and though I won\u2019t touch the babies, I still oooh and aw over them. Mostly I just check in with the moms though lol", "NTA but honestly he just showed you he no longer should get updates on your pregnancy. Even if you talk to him he probably won't change. If something happens and you miscarry I highly doubt he's capable of being any sort of emotional support. So don't bother updating him anymore. He's clearly missing an empathy chip.", "YWBTA, so you're using the puppy comment as a reason to basically try to tell him he would be cruel to a potential baby? You are WAY ahead of yourself and no you shouldn't call him out, how absurd!", "NTA. I'd just leave him in the dust. He sounds like he's not actually a friend.", "Bringing up the possibility of something going wrong during a pregnancy isn't part of being childfree, it's part of being an ahole. You are NTA, but you might be expecting too much from this person and might want to reconsider having your child around them if they don't find some basic decency. Wishing you a happy, healthy pregnancy!!", "NTA. I have multiple friends who are child free. One who really hates kids. ALL of them have met my kids and been friendly. My friendship with the one hates kids changed but she still asks about them because she knows they are part of my life. R is a jerk. And M needs a reality check for enabling them.", "NTA. I\u2019ve heard the saying \u201cyou have the right to a child free life but not a child free world\u201d. My friends who are very much child free was still supportive in my pregnancy and in my miscarriage. They know we wouldn\u2019t demand they babysit, help out, etc. We have different wants in our lives and that\u2019s fine for all of us. Your friend is being a dick for no reason. \n\nAlso, congratulations on your pregnancy. The early stages are super terrifying. I hope you get all the love and support you need. And, FYI, Reddit had bumpers groups for people due in the same month. They\u2019re great for resources, support, and knowledge. My first is a toddler now and it\u2019s amazing to connect to other parents with kids the same age because I\u2019ve gotten so much support about everything from picky eating to milestones.", "You got a faint positive test THIS MORNING, and you think you already have a baby and you already managed to create drama around it? Bahaha. You know there is 'no yolk yet' but you are already sharing this with people and expect them to be excited for your, lets call it what it is at this point, missed period? You are... otherwise intellectually gifted.", "That\u2019s a horrible thing to say to anyone, and this person is one of your best friends? You should absolutely say something, they need to realize how insensitive it is to wish a miscarriage on their close friend who they know has experienced complications and will need to be very careful in the future. YWNBTA\nCongrats on your pregnancy. Hoping the best for you and your partner. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Being childfree does not mean you get to be cruel. My best friend is childfree, she wants a full hysterectomy soon. I have PCOS and gave birth 5 months ago. Not once did she ever make a cruel joke or every say anything rude. She supported me through two years of fertility treatment, morning sickness, helped me throw a surprise party to announce my pregnancy to our friends. That\u2019s what friends do. He is not your friend, drop him. \n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy! Many happy wishes to you and your growing family!", "NTA!\n\nR is literally acting like this is about HIM. it's making me mad af. He's such a bad friend, specially if he already knows all of the things you have passed! please don't stress over his ass anymore. he's not worthy of your friendship.", "Honestly his comments would be downright cruel without all the background knowledge. You never wish a miscarriage on someone who is pregnant and wants their baby with a healthy pregnancy and an average chance of miscarriage. Wishing it on someone struggling with infinity and who has a high chance of miscarriage??  Absolutely fucking unacceptable. It\u2019s just not done. Hell, you don\u2019t have to like kids or want to be around them to show the basic level of respect. My best friend used to listen to my daycare stories when I worked at one, and they typically don\u2019t want to be left alone with children or babies. \n\nIt\u2019s really not hard to be excited for someone\u2019s pregnancy, even if you\u2019re not fully comfortable around kids. Especially when you know that friend has been through hell trying to get pregnant and is going to go through hell until that kid is born healthy. \n\nI really hope you carry to term and have a healthy baby. I hope your fears and your worry subside throughout your pregnancy and that your dream of having a healthy child comes through.

I've been reading all of the comments and your responses...congratulations btw!\n\nYou've essentially been parents for almost 5 years now. Celebrated your cousin's birthday. Likely other holidays. Presumably this kiddo is a very large part of your life and with you 80+% of the time. R not liking kids is one thing. This is entirely something else. \n\nSee, I was willing to give R an out on the miscarriage/puppy comment, thinking that while terrible, you becoming a parent and having a squishy little baby around could be really overwhelming for R. But, you've been a parent and had a squishy little baby around for 5 years! \n\nI don't know anything about you or R or what kind of friend he's been/support he's given. I'd suggest thinking about the role he's played in your life the last 5 years, and what role you want him to play in the future. You seem to have to go out of your way for hid comfort.", "I was that friend who doesnt like children when my best friend had a kid. I will say I miss hanging out with my friend but he's no longer the same person from before his kid. It sucks, but after accepting that I was able to make a new group of friends with similar interests and I'm much happier socially. I hope he was able to find a group of dads he can confide his dad stuff with but we just weren't meeting each other's needs anymore.", "Because he's my best friend and has been there for me through some of the worst days of my life. And this is a happy time but also fucking terrifying. I knew he was child-free but didn't think he'd essentially wish death on my child in exchange for a puppy. We're not telling a lot of people. But if God forbid something happens we shouldn't have to go through it alone. We (and every other couple) need and deserve a support system. \n\nAnd thank you!", "Me worried my mom said \"I hope you have a daughter just like you one day!\"one too many times and the universe heard it. \ud83d\ude02", "It doesn't sound like he was joking. It sounds like he was being judgemental. My sister was like this when I announced my first pregnancy. She picked at me for announcing at 8 weeks, said I should have waited till 12, like I was being reckless announcing early to immediate family. Then she proceeded to quiz me on how I was going to afford the baby, maternity leave, etc. Her comment 'I hope your job has a good maternity leave!'. Those weren't jokes She was judging me. She felt she knew more than me, she just had to get her say in. She didn't care that I was 29, married for 6 years, owned a home and had a job where I made enough to where we also announced my husband would be staying home.\n\nThis is exactly what your friend is doing. He doesn't want to be apart of this part of your life and he is judging you for announcing early and in general, having a baby because he hates kids and can't wrap his head around it enough to feel joy for anyone.  This guy is a shit person."]}
