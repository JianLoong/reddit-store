We're getting married in a few months and my current OBGYN suggested we start trying now since \"it won't actually happen for a while\". WELL! We started taking ovulation tests. The first two months I didn't ovulate, as expected. But last month (January) I thought I ovulated but wasn't really sure. This morning we got a faint positive, but a positive nonetheless. I don't know how we managed to conceive our first real try after 4 doctors and I don't even know how many tests said we couldn't. But we did. We obviously know what can go wrong so we're excited but also terrified. Fianc\u00e9 and I agreed we'd keep it between us and 3 friends we agreed on. One of those friends was my friend \"R\". We've been best friends for 14 years. \n\n\"R\" is \\*very\\* childfree. Which is fine. I would never expect him to babysit or go out of his way to play with my children. But I do expect some decency. If the kid comes up to you and says \"Do you like my picture?\" be nice and say yes kind of vibe. R knows how I feel about children and how upset the PCOS. made me. He knows what PCOS is and what the risks and challenges are. When I told him he said \"Oh? There's still plenty of opportunity for something to go wrong.\" and I said \"Yeah...we know...just trying to be excited while we can...\" and he said \"You could just get a puppy.\" And I didn't answer. \n\nMy other best friend \"M\" says IWBTA if I said something to him. She says he's childfree and I can't expect him to \"change\" because I'm having a baby. She also said after all these years of friendship I can't be that caught off guard. I don't think I'm asking I'm to change anything. I'm not expecting him to babysit or change diapers or feed the baby or anything. But a little support? Sympathy? Kindness? I don't think that's asking him to suddenly love children. Technically, sort of, in a way, there's not even a child yet. I'm 12 days past ovulation. I don't even think there's a yolk in the yolk sac at this point. So I'm really asking him to be nice to ME at this point. Although I would like to tell him that when we do have a child, whether that happens from this pregnancy or a different one, he needs to be nice and friendly towards the child. \n\nI want to say something like \"Listen, I know you don't want kids and that's fine. But this is crazy and scary and I would appreciate your support and good vibes. Not jokes about miscarrying so I can get a puppy. And then I have the baby I'm not expecting you to babysit or take care of the child, but I am expecting you to treat them like a human being and show them kindness and respect.\" Too much?

And I'm just sitting here waiting to lose this baby.

I cannot deal with that and R's comments.", "Even though I never explicitly stated my boundaries?", "+1", "It really was the miscarriage comment that got me.

R has never even met him because I know he doesn't want kids hanging around and I respect that. And there's never been a time where cousin \"had\" to tag along with us. Because we haven't legally adopted him. (His mom just literally told me to get him when he was 3 days old because she \"couldn't do it anymore\". I'm thinking it was PPD. They've gotten better over the years so he does spend some time with them now, but it's a slow transition. So I just see R when cousin is with his parents.) So R should know having a kid won't effect our friendship. I mean this one might be around a little more because he won't have every other weekend with other parents. But I'm SURE my mom, sister, cousins, aunts, will BEG for the chance to watch the baby. I'm not even entirely sure I'LL ever get to meet the baby with how excited everyone is going to be.", "Oh my goodness. Endo and PCOS?! You're right, that is a miracle. I hope everything is going well. <3 \n\nI definitely think I need to say something to him.", "He definitely saw me at my worst, which I think makes his reaction hurt worse. I was lucky? (not sure I should use that word here) enough to actually get diagnosed with PCOS before we were ready for a baby. So I had time to be told by 4 different doctors (2 gynos, 2 primary) and more tests than I can count that I wouldn't get pregnant. I actually have an appointment with an endocrinologist tomorrow, which was supposed to be for learning more about my hormones so we could have a better idea on what medications I'd need. He saw me sob and sob and sob and have panic attacks over it. I mean maybe he thinks that's all magically erased because I got pregnant on the first try. And I know I'm lucky. I'm so lucky I still don't even think it really sank in. Even if God forbid this doesn't stick. I can get pregnant. We know that now. Awesome. But that does not erase the sheer terror I felt at the thought of not conceiving.", "Oof. I didn't think about needing to go to him for mom struggles, but you're right. He's one of my go-to's because he is so good at helping me organize my thoughts and process my feelings. That's why he was one of our \"tell immediately people\". So I'm bound to want to go to him with mom struggles. Which I know are normal  and will always happen no matter how badly you wanted children.", "Yeah, the miscarriage joke has me a little shook. I'm not the silent treatment type but I had to stop answering once that sunk in.", "I never really thought about it that way. I need to rethink how I'll word things than. \n\nThank you so much. <3 I'm currently having an internal battle between \"just pretend you're not so when it goes bad you won't be as upset\" and \"enjoy it while you can\".", "I do think waiting for another comment would make what I have to say feel less \"attacky\" too.", "I mean, if this isn't the most accurate comment on all of Reddit.

My therapist said I'm \"surprisingly okay\" for all that I've gone through. Which was the weirdest compliment I've ever received. I've been through some shit, but that's a whole different post.", "I really do though. I think I'd be upset if he wasn't childfree, honestly. His personality just doesn't vibe with being a parent. I think he'd go crazy. So I definitely support his very smart decision. But like just don't be mean to me.", "The grief is awful. I've been there. When I was officially diagnosed I held it together in the office and then lost it in the parking lot. It was so bad 2 people stopped and asked if I was okay. (I had to go alone too because of Covid.) And I swear I've cried every day since. But you do eventually get used to it, just like when someone passes away. I'd recommend starting out with the cheapy ovulation tests, we used Pregmate, just to get a feel for your cycle. Then invest in Mira. It's $200 for the machine and it'll run you about $80 a month for the tests. But the more you know your cycle the less tests you'll need because you'll be able to zone in on when you should be testing. But it's really like having a mini lab in your home. I'm not sure what's wrong so I don't know if you'll get pregnant without medical intervention, but knowing your cycle would still help the doctors make the medical interventions more successful. \n\nThose are some REAL friends you have.", "Maybe? I don't know what that is. Lol", "You're my first congratulations!!! :') Thank you!! You know R's response. M just screamed. Legend has it she's still screaming. (Happy screaming.) And my other friend is a nurse so she just started giving me vitamins to take and what to ask my doctor for. Haha \n\nOof! What?! Someone once told me having a child was the most selfish thing you could do because there is no reason to have a biological child that doesn't start with \"I\" or \"we\". I sat and thought for DAYS and she was right. But I don't think you have to keep it a selfish situation. (And either way to call someone selfish for having a baby is WILD! SO inappropriate. She's a foster parent so I guess it's just a sore sport for her. And \"narcissistic\" makes no sense. That's a whole mental illness she accused you of.) I realize life sucks and this child only exists because I had sex. And now they have to deal with heartbreak and taxes and work and bills and school and bullies and all that other bad stuff. But I will make sure their life is so fucking amazing that they don't even care about the other crap. And, your friend can sleep well knowing that we'll teach them to recycle too. We also plant trees all the time because I like trees. Ugh. I'm sorry you went through that. I don't understand these toxic people either.", "I'm so sorry. His comments are cruel, almost as if they are specifically targeted to hurt you, and you have every right to be upset with him.\n\nCrossing my fingers for you with this pregnancy. My sister also has PCOS but managed to have two kids naturally, so it's not hopeless. Wishing you the best!", "He honestly doesn't sound like much of a friend at this point. It's almost like he's wishing you to miscarry so his childlessness won't somehow be inconvenienced. You're anxious enough about this, maybe stay away from him until he cuts the crap and apologizes.", "I have PCOS too and I read plenty of stories about women with PCOS conceiving naturally. Even my grandma, who also had it, was able to have my dad. Make sure you get tested, it has greater risk of gestational diabetes. I wish you the best of lucks.", "Yeah, he doesn't have to be \"nice\", but he can keep his damn yap shut if he wants to stay friends.", "Many boundaries are usually implied. Now would be a good time to communicate those boundaries explicitly (text or in-person.) Then express what you expect from him as your friend.", "Common decency is not that hard to respect or follow. He was being an a-hole for the sake of it.", "Validate the friendship and let him know how much you love and respect him and don't want to change him. But that this is a super scary time for you and that you really need his emotional support. Promise to never ask to babysit and to always try to make your friendship a priority, but let him know that while you might not have as much quantity time with him, that you will always try to make it quality time.\n\nHe needs to understand that growing up means change. He'll have to change and grow with you or end up getting left behind.", "I couldn't imagine being told that I am infertile, or have fertility issues. My partner is the reason we ultimately had to conceive via IVF, but still going through the process as the person who is ultimately going to be pregnant, was freaking exhausting. \n\nThere is a lot that can still go wrong, and stress can contribute to that. So having friend(s) be supportive is beyond crucial, in any regards, but especially when you do have underlying factors. \n\nSupport should be there always, for everything, regardless of whether your friend wants kids in the future or not.", "I'm so sorry you are in this position.  I hope he chooses to be a real friend.  Best thoughts for a healthy and easy pregnancy!", "The first 12 weeks are the most iffy part in normal pregnancies. I don't have PCOS, so I don't know the additional risk it adds. I just hope it works out. Try to be hopeful, though. Emotional stress is a factor, even if it's a small one.\n\nAs for your friend, I could be wrong and he's just an asshole, but it's a consideration. I am giving him benefit of the doubt.", "Definitely there is a fair chance that conversation has not been living in their head like it has been in yours.", "There's also a huge difference between childfree and child hating. Your friend sounds more like the latter. My Aunt was childfree - never wanted her own. She liked children well enough though, enjoyed chatting to them etc. and was also happy she could always return them to their parents.", "If he continues then cut him off. You don't need the negativity. Pregnancy is hard enough without cruelty.", "I really understand you so much, I also went to the doctor and the exams alone. It's like being swept away by a wave without being able to swim, you go from feeling like you've been taken away from deciding on your body to feeling mutilated in some way and every period that comes is so damn painful for your heart. I have come to feel that I'm less of a woman (although my mind knows well that this does not define who I'm)They discovered it because I had problems with my cycle for many years and I went to consult for that, possibly I need surgery but I take note of everything you kindly shared with me, but since it was an unexpected discovery, it was not in my plans to have children at this time, I don't even have a partner, at least I know what I'm up against but it doesn't stop hurting.\nThey are wonderful friends, they made me feel heard and loved. and they are the only two people in my environment who know it, I don't regret it. \n\nI repeat that I really hope with all my heart that everything goes well with you OP.", "I mean, I do think he has to be nice. Which maybe is why M thinks I'm an asshole. There's not much \"niceness\" he has to do now. But he's bound to end up in the same room as my kid one day. And if they say hello or ask if he likes dinosaurs or says some other weird thing that kids say than I do expect him to be nice and answer. He doesn't have to get down on the floor and play with the kid. But he needs to be nice. Like if he looks at my kid and tells them he wishes they died in utero and would have preferred a puppy I'll definitely turn into an asshole at that point.", "Many boundaries are just common decency.", "Yes yes yes to al of that! We actually have a 4 and a half year old (unofficially adopted from a relative because of reasons, long complicated story). So he should already know I won't push the baby onto him. He's never even met my baby cousin. I haven't purposely kept them apart. There's just never been a situation where they had to be in the same place at the same time. And I'm not going out of my way to arrange visits because he doesn't like kids. He's made jokes about \"he'd prefer a puppy\" when he's seen Franklin in the background if we're video chatting. But the miscarriage \"joke\" made me realize how serious he actually is.", "It's wonderful IVF is possible but it's an absolutely horrible thing to have to go through. I had a few friends who had to do it. And my mom did 13 IUIs to get pregnant with me. (Religious hospital 30 years ago so they wouldn't let her do IVF.) I hope you're doing okay and that you have a good support system. Wishing you the best of luck. <3", "You described the feelings perfectly!! Please know that you are not less of a woman. I'm not just saying that, it's a fact. There are so many issues that cause infertility. I think 1 in 18 women have PCOS. I don't know the numbers for other issues, but it's a lot. Some women have fertility issues \"just because\". There's also male factor infertility. It is SO HARD to get pregnant. It really is. I don't know a single woman who didn't struggle. So I promise, that this doesn't make you less of a woman but rather just a normal one.\n\nI really hope everything goes well for you too. I hope you're in good health and that your surgery goes well and that a baby happens at the perfect time for you. This is a throwaway, but I'll try to remember to come back on and update you!", "Joking about miscarriage? Well i would unleash the hell.", "M is an asshole as well then. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask someone not to say stupid shit when you are going thru anxiety over something you didn\u2019t even think could happen!", "I am child free. I would rather not hold the baby in the family pass-round. I would never in a THOUSAND YEARS bring up the suggestion of miscarriage with a wanted baby or ever say something hurtful to a child. \n\nYour friend isn't \"child free\", he's a dick. I strongly suggest you become him-free.", "It's possible that he may not even realize how you took the joke, and how offensive you may have found it? So maybe if I bringing it up he will temper his thoughts a little more in the future. Mariscarriage jokes are never ever appropriate however.\n\nGood luck, with the friendship and with the baby. Sounds like you have going to have a wonderful wonderful family. Congratulations."]}
