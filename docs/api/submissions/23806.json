To celebrate, we are taking a 5 day vacation, just the 2 of us.  It's the first time that she and I (38M) have been away like this as a couple since the birth of our son almost 4 years ago.  We planned this trip months ago and my wife asked her mom if she would be willing to come to our house and watch our son while we are away.  MIL agreed right away.\n\nMIL is in her early 60s but doesn't have a \"real\" job.  She will do cleaning for her brother who owns a bunch of rental properties and he pays her in cash.  So, it's not like she has a schedule she has to clear to stay with our son for a few days.  \n\nLast weekend, my wife called MIL to talk to her about our trip and to ask if there's anything MIL will need/want us to stock in the house as far as food or necessities.  During the conversation, MIL said that she will need $100 per day from us.  This is the first time she ever brought up wanting to get paid to watch our son.  My wife was caught off guard and just kind of agreed to it.  \n\nBut when she got off the phone and told me about it, I got upset.  I told her that MIL is taking advantage of the situation because she thinks we have no other options.  I told her that is BS that she sprung this on us so close to our trip and I don't think we should pay her anything.  I said that I would call my parents and see if they can watch our son instead.  \n\nMy wife told me that MIL wouldn't ask that sort of thing unless she needs the money and that adding $500 to our vacation trip isn't that much of a big deal.  I told her that it's not about the money to me, it's about MIL being sneaky and manipulative.  \n\nI called my mom and asked her if they would be able to watch our son instead and she jumped at the idea.  Both my parents are recently retired, so they have plenty of free time and would love an extended grandson visit.  I didn't explain the reason for the change, I just told them that things didn't work out with MIL.\n\nI told my wife that my parents can watch our son instead and that she should call her mom and tell her that we no longer need her to babysit.  She said that she didn't want to do that because MIL was really looking forward to seeing our son, it has been over 6-months.  I told her that if she was looking forward to it that much, she wouldn't be trying to swindle us out of $500.  I told her if she didn't want to make the call, I would gladly do it.  \n\nShe reluctantly made the call herself, but it didn't go well.  MIL got upset because we are now \"depriving her of seeing her grandson.\"  My wife got emotional and ended up backtracking and said she would talk to me and see if we could work something out.  After the call, she asked me if there was some way we could figure this out and I told her we aren't changing anything again this close to our trip.\n\nShe said maybe we could offer MIL a lesser amount but I reiterated that it isn't about the money, it's about MIL being sneaky and trying to take advantage of us.

Me. But I also know if something is wrong with my car that I can make a phone call and someone will help me out free of charge.\n\nGetting MILs favorite food and whatnot and asking her if she WANTED TO ahead of time is what's normal.

I think she should have been open about it when first approached, but I don't think she's trying to turn a profit or anything.", "Does it suck though? If my own mom who I get along really well with would do the same I'd tell to go on a hike. You want to be paid, it's fine, but you say that at the start.

And they should have the opportunity to decide what they want.

Helping family has never been transactional for me.", ">Have you done anything for your MIL that would warrant her doing this favor for you?\n\nIn my opinion, yes.  Two years ago MIL's husband (wife's stepdad) threw out his back and couldn't do anything for pretty much 2 months.  My wife and I both helped them extensively with work around their house, errands, groceries, etc.  Never asked for a dime.", "that's literally exactly what he did???", "But MIL should have been upfront about the money.

She made a reasonable request to be paid for services rendered/her time and you equate that with withholding her grandchild. And honestly $100 a day for four-year-old is extremely reasonable, so she was not taking advantage of you at all.", "To me, it\u2019s entitled to expect free babysitting. Like is it nice if they don\u2019t charge yes absolutely but you can\u2019t expect it and then throw a fit when you don\u2019t get that. Especially 24 hrs for 5 days with a 4 yo? That\u2019s a LOT. \n\nEven if one of my friends/ family watches our kiddos and won\u2019t let us pay we do SOMETHING, snacks/food for the weekend/favorite treat, we bought someone a heated camping chair bc they\u2019re always cold \ud83d\ude02", "No she didn\u2019t, OP said they asked her months ago. She only told the wife last weekend she expected 100 a day.", "Up front means when asked to do it, not less than two weeks before hand.", "Yeah ignore those people because they always advise that you are owed endless support but never owe anyone else anything.\n\n\nThats what family and especially grandparents are supposed to do. If she needed payment she could have said it when she agreed. She clearly held off on that news until you were in her estimation too close to the trip day to back out or find replacement child care\n\n\nShe tried to finesse you and your wife and thats gross", "Yeah I mean if she initially was upfront about it then I would side with the other ppl on this sub. However really confused why so many ppl are voting against you on this. The way she did it was sneaky/underhanded and it would piss me off too.

If your in laws were decent parents, your wife is supposed to offer a reasonable amount of assistance to them when they need it and as her husband you\u2019re supposed to support her in that. Running errands and doing house work for two months is a small sacrifice compared to all your in laws sacrificed to raise your wife. \n\nIf you would prefer to have someone watch your kid for free, that\u2019s fine. However don\u2019t act like your MIL is unreasonable to ask to be compensation for giving up five days of her life to take care of your child.", "Alright that's fair.  I also think the MIL's saying your address depriving of seeing the grandson is manipulative. She can see him when she wants right? Just not on vacation. She's allowed to ask for payment, but you are also allowed to decline the offer upon hearing about it. As for helping them out in the future, perhaps do ask for compensation or don't offer.", "Based on the fact that the conversation about money started with the wife asking what MIL wanted in the house, I would say yes", "Well, we were able to find someone else to provide that service for free.  So, free market capitalism wins again!", "It is entitled to assume someone will cover your childcare for free, but it's absolutely not acceptable to agree to provide that service without bringing up compensation or terms first. It would have been perfectly acceptable for her to ask compensation at the time of the agreement.", "Asking for money is one thing. Asking for money at the last minute after agreeing to it months ago is another.", "Great! I\u2019m glad they WANTED to for free. The key to that is that they wanted to do it without compensation, which is amazing. I have friends that will watch my kids for free as well but I offer to pay and if declined we either treat them to something or buy food for the weekend or offered to take their kids in return. It\u2019s reciprocal and not expected. That\u2019s the whole point.", "It sounds like OP wouldn\u2019t have been willing to pay her regardless of when she asked for it. He seems to think that grandparents shouldn\u2019t be compensated for watching their grandkids. That\u2019s my problem with his stance on this. Personally I think compensation should have been offered when they asked her to take care of the child. That\u2019s how my parents always did it. They never asked family to take care of their kids without offering something in return."]}
