To celebrate, we are taking a 5 day vacation, just the 2 of us.  It's the first time that she and I (38M) have been away like this as a couple since the birth of our son almost 4 years ago.  We planned this trip months ago and my wife asked her mom if she would be willing to come to our house and watch our son while we are away.  MIL agreed right away.\n\nMIL is in her early 60s but doesn't have a \"real\" job.  She will do cleaning for her brother who owns a bunch of rental properties and he pays her in cash.  So, it's not like she has a schedule she has to clear to stay with our son for a few days.  \n\nLast weekend, my wife called MIL to talk to her about our trip and to ask if there's anything MIL will need/want us to stock in the house as far as food or necessities.  During the conversation, MIL said that she will need $100 per day from us.  This is the first time she ever brought up wanting to get paid to watch our son.  My wife was caught off guard and just kind of agreed to it.  \n\nBut when she got off the phone and told me about it, I got upset.  I told her that MIL is taking advantage of the situation because she thinks we have no other options.  I told her that is BS that she sprung this on us so close to our trip and I don't think we should pay her anything.  I said that I would call my parents and see if they can watch our son instead.  \n\nMy wife told me that MIL wouldn't ask that sort of thing unless she needs the money and that adding $500 to our vacation trip isn't that much of a big deal.  I told her that it's not about the money to me, it's about MIL being sneaky and manipulative.  \n\nI called my mom and asked her if they would be able to watch our son instead and she jumped at the idea.  Both my parents are recently retired, so they have plenty of free time and would love an extended grandson visit.  I didn't explain the reason for the change, I just told them that things didn't work out with MIL.\n\nI told my wife that my parents can watch our son instead and that she should call her mom and tell her that we no longer need her to babysit.  She said that she didn't want to do that because MIL was really looking forward to seeing our son, it has been over 6-months.  I told her that if she was looking forward to it that much, she wouldn't be trying to swindle us out of $500.  I told her if she didn't want to make the call, I would gladly do it.  \n\nShe reluctantly made the call herself, but it didn't go well.  MIL got upset because we are now \"depriving her of seeing her grandson.\"  My wife got emotional and ended up backtracking and said she would talk to me and see if we could work something out.  After the call, she asked me if there was some way we could figure this out and I told her we aren't changing anything again this close to our trip.\n\nShe said maybe we could offer MIL a lesser amount but I reiterated that it isn't about the money, it's about MIL being sneaky and trying to take advantage of us.

Let\u2019s not downplay the workload that goes into something like that. \n\nAs a parent, I wouldn\u2019t expect my mother to ask me for money to watch my kids but I damn sure would offer it because it\u2019s a ton of work.", "YTA and I\u2019m so surprised that people are saying you\u2019re not! What about assuming positive intentions? I read this assuming she wants to watch her grandson but needs a little money to make up for not working (and cleaning IS a real job). If you clarified that you where absolutely sure she didn\u2019t meet that money, and were not scornful of her job, my answer would be different.", "ESH, sure she could have brought it up earlier, but you think overnight childcare for 5 nights should just be \u2026 free?\n\nShe has a job.

Now you put your wife in the middle of this, and most likey ruining the trip for both of you.", "Luckily we can afford to babysit our grandkids although we\u2019re retired. However, I should say that every time they spend the weekend it easily turns into $200 to $300 between food (they\u2019re picky eaters), outings (zoo, movies, bowling, arcade, etc.) Heck, last week it was $65 just to order pizza for three of them. Everything is extremely expensive. I agree that the mother-in-law\u2018s timing wasn\u2019t the best but honestly it\u2019s quite a bit of money to babysit for a whole week when you factor in all those extras.\nSo I would say  YTA for coming across as condescending and judgmental toward your mother-in-law without knowing her circumstances. If she\u2019s in her 60s, she\u2019s probably retired or nearing retirement and that money adds up.", "I am sure he saying MIL is manipulative and is trying to swindle them will make for a great and joyous celebration for his wife.\n\nBecause, hey, the important thing here is that he save s money. Why would he care to word things nicely and tactfully to his wife when speaking about her mother?", "YTA. I\u2019m probably going to be crucified for this, but you\u2019re being ridiculous. My guess is she may be struggling for money. The economy right now sucks - and depending on how far she\u2019s driving to get to your house - she might need gas money. Have you ever had to admit to someone that you\u2019re struggling financially? It is so hard to do. I also imagine that she might be planning to use that money to take her grandchild to do things. \n\nAll that aside, here\u2019s where you\u2019re truly the AH: you\u2019ve chosen this hill to die on for really no good reason. You called your parents, involved them, and then made your wife call her mom and break the news of YOUR unilateral decision to her. Sure, you said you would, but your phrasing around her (the real job comment) makes it seem like you look down on her and would\u2019ve gleefully called her and been hateful. Is there another reason why you seem so judgmental and nasty about her? \n\nFor all of those out there saying grandparents should watch grandchildren for free, please realize this economy is hard. Grandparents often have to scrimp to even afford food for themselves - and frequently must decide between food and medication.

This strikes me more as a mismatch of expectations coupled with a failure to communicate. If MIL is cleaning houses for cash she\u2019s not rolling in dough, and OP\u2019s wife believes she needs the money; since she otherwise works for family members she may have seen this as an opportunity to see her grandson while picking up a bit extra. She\u2019s TA for assuming that but it\u2019s not a huge stretch. \n\nIt\u2019s OP\u2019s overt paranoia and hostility that takes this over the top and leads me to believe something else is wrong. He uses words like sneaky and manipulative, and accuses her of trying to take advantage of them. He accuses her of trying to swindle them out of $500. (Asking to be paid for services rendered - grandma or not - is not a swindle.) He clearly believes she was trying to trap them, but it\u2019s not like she waited until the last minute - it sounds like she brought this up 2 weeks in advance. And OP\u2019s wife initially agreed. \n\nIt is entirely reasonable to switch grandparents and save the $500. But I can\u2019t help but suspect OP is being TA about it.", "YTA for your attitude towards your MIL.

This would have given you an opportunity to work out a reasonable fee.\n\nYou suck for losing your shit when told the privilege of your child's company for 5 days and nights doesn't eliminate the need for monetary compensation.

During the trip my mom started telling me about how she needed to be compensated (she also doesn\u2019t work) and I obviously told her that we would have went an other route if we knew this prior bc I\u2019m not paying you to watch your grandkids.

Now if I offer, and they refuse, that's a different story and not part of this.\r  \n\r  \nI could see free if it's a day, but 5 days, that is beyond the \"Free\" zone.  Also, who's to say MIL has the disposable income to buy food and the like while babysitting(maybe wants to take the kid on outings, which can easily cost $$$), that $100 per day could easily go toward the care of the kid and not necessarily go into her pocket.  Would it be offensive if she gave them a bill for all the money she spent caring for the kid while they were gone? Or did they just expect all costs to be on the babysitter?  Plus MIL is giving up her work time to watch their kid, she can't work if she's babysitting for 5 days.  The big issues for MIL are the timing and the guilt trip.\r  \n\r\r  \nNow to the parents, family helps family, but it can't be one sided, or else it's taking advantage.  Childcare by itself is expensive.  Taking a grandchild for a day every so often is fine for family time, but any more than 1 day is not family time, that is in the realm of babysitting/parenting; which is CHILDCARE, therefore it should be paid for.  She's helping you, would it hurt to help her, since she's doing you a favor?  THEN going and changing the plans, AFTER AGREEING!  Granted, it should have been discussed before agreeing, but an agreement by 1 is still a commitment.  After said commitment, if plans were going to change, again it should have been discussed, ie. grandparents, can you cover? \"yes\", cool, I'll confirm with MIL.  MIL, $100 wasn't discussed, if you had brought this up earlier, we could have worked something out, grandparents can cover, MIL \"sorry for bringing it up late, but xyz, I can cover for $75 per day, if that helps?\" etc...

Since it\u2019s been 6 months, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the MIL lives far enough away that it\u2019s not really affordable for her to visit regularly. My guess is that the $500 is basically enough to cover gas, household necessities for the week, and a little extra for gas money while she was there and to take the son to a few fun activities.

And you jumped at the chance to compare and show your wife how your parents are so much better than her mom is.\n\nThe relationship that matters here is between your wife and her mom, NOT between you and your MIL. It does not matter what you think of your MIL's request for cash. It's a trivial amount of money. It matters what your wife thinks. \n\nMIL has done nothing to you personally. Stop meddling with your wife's relationship with her mom. You are not part of this dynamic. This is not about you.", "I understand the gut reaction of taking offense, but I think you aren't taking into account that MIL still needs to work for money, and your parents don't. Her financial situation may have changed in the last few months (the pandemic benefits for food stamps, Medicare and medicaid just ended and a lot of people's benefits were cut in half after 3 years).\n\nIt is fine that $500 is more than you want to spend on childcare, but you are  assuming MIL's motivations are malicious. I hope your wife checks on her Mom to see if she's okay or in need. MIL definitely made a bad choice in how she asked for compensation. That doesn't mean she didn't actually need it. \n\nNAH.", "INFO: did you MIL say you needed to pay her $100/day, or that she needed $100/day for incidental expenses that may come up while looking after your kid, like to go out to the park or buying extra supplies?", "YTA. This is a present for your wife. You can afford it your MIL obviously needs the money. You just ruined everything about the trip. The \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have a real job she does cleaning \u201c comment is telling. It\u2019s five days with a toddler. I pay 40\u20ac for my dog. The way she did it might have been sprung on you but you risk your relationship with wife and MIL for so little. Silly move IMO", "I do not believe the MIL was being sneaky. Rather she didn't think to ask for payment right away and then brought it up when the trip was next discussed. Obviously, she knows OP's parents are newly retired and might be available to watch the grandchild on short notice. My parents are around the same age and they are not as quick-thinking as they used to be when they have to make decisions on the spot - MIL could be the same way.", "All the people saying she was being sneaky and underhanded, what kind of relatives do you have? The me tion of compensation came up when the wife asked what she wanted or needed for the week. Maybe that seemed like the right time to discuss that. Obviously she is not well off, and hasn't seen the grandchild for 6 months probably due to travel costs. Maybe all she was saying was that was so they could do fun things while she is there and pay for her gas to and from. It isnt fair to expect someone eho struggles to take on extra financial burden to do you a favor. You don't know because you threw a tantrum and didn't bother to find out. YTA, and somehow I doubt money isn't the issue since your throwing such a fit! Your wife deserves better. I'm a Nana to 7 adorable grands, and no, I would not expect compensation, but I will say, I watch mine anytime they need because I love the little mini people but at times when their parents seem to expect this instead of make sure it's not a problem, it gets aggravating. We are lucky enough to have the free time and means to do so.  The fact she asked should not be offensive as much as you should have wanted to compensate a person you know is not well off for giving up 5 days of their time and away from their home and you also expect them to spend their money to do so. That is an AH move period.", "YTA. MIL has a job. She cleans for her brother. If you're asking her to take 5 days off. She's out that income, whatever you think of her \"real\" job. And you sprang this on her with 2 weeks' notice, as well. You're asking her to take time off from a job she doesn't get PTO from.", "ESH  \n\n\n$100 a day for live in childcare isn't unreasonable but it should have been discussed upfront. Spending a week solid with your son may mean she has to pass up other income earning opportunities. Expecting her to do it for free simply because she doesn't have a \"real job\" and is the grandparent is taking advantage of her IMO. She should have brought it up the first time it was proposed though.", "YTA. But I am biased because I have been in very similar situations with my own mom. Which is surprisingly uncommon based off the majority reaction here.\n\nIt seems clear that you MIL struggles with money and you're aware of this. You should have offered to pay upfront instead of assuming she'd watch your kid for free because she clearly needs the money. She does odd jobs to get by. My mom is in a similar position. We've left her in charge of the kids for a similar length of time and paid her $100/day. My mom doesn't have a lot and this is our way of giving a proud woman money without her feeling like it's charity. \n\nYes, grandparents love to watch their grandkids and do it often without payment. But if your MIL needs extra cash, it's reasonable for her to think you would pay her for watching your kid for 5 days. And if you can afford it, then why are you being stingy instead of helping family? \n\nEveryone here is mad about her not helping out and fulfilling her grandparent/family duties. But from my perspective that's hypocritical because that's exactly what you're doing - she's family, she needs some  extra income but you're taking advantage of free childcare instead of recognizing that and offering it from the get go. Sometimes it's hard for parents to admit they need help from their kids. Did you ever consider this might be embarrassing for her? Especially now, knowing that your parents are A) aware that she asked you for money and B) swooping in to save the day for free? \n\nI dont know, i guess she could be jerk and trying to take advantage of you. But considering how your wife is reacting, i don't think your MIL is as manipulative as this sub would love to believe. I feel bad for her.", "NTA; *But* expecting anyone, even family, to watch your child for free is kinda naive. You both are in the wrong for not addressing it earlier. I would\u2019ve at least offered some sort of compensation, at least giving her the option to turn it down. You would pay a trusted nanny or babysitter to watch after your child, why not compensate your MIL? She\u2019s not obligated to watch your child for you, she\u2019s doing it to help you out. I don\u2019t think she was trying to manipulate you or taken advantage of you.", "Sad that I had to scroll this far to find someone who is willing to take a hypothetical that MIL needs the $500 for non-nefarious reasons", "MIL didn\u2019t say she would spend money on the child. I bet they would leave money for that.", "10 days before trip.", "It\u2019s cheap sure but he has other family willing to do it for free soooo..", "MIL needs to pick a lane. She either wants money to babysit or she wants to be with her grandchild. I think OP did the right thing in calling her bluff and bringing in his parents to babysit. Next time MIL will know the score. If she wants to babysit, she'll have to compete with the other side of the family who will do it out of love instead of expecting to get paid.", "Plus, did OP say it's been 6 months since she visited her grandchild?", "He clearly said money isn't the issue. It is the manner that MIL brought this up. Waiting until last minute to mention getting paid is underhanded. Then complaining about how she doesn't get to see her grandkids lol", "I suspect it\u2019s more likely there was an expectation gap - OPs wife asked what she\u2019d need, and she said $100/day (Which could well include coverage for expenses spending time with grandson) so it wasn\u2019t an entirely inappropriate time to bring it up.", "100 percent this. It sounds like his MIL really wants to watch the kid but is having trouble affording it (probably doesn't have PTO). MIL was probably hoping her daughter would offer some compensation, no offer was made, so she casually asked for a reasonable amount of money. I'm sure it was embarrassing for her to ask for that money from her daughter.\n\nRegardless, it is NOT OP's place to interpret the request for money. It's not his mom. He needs to let his wife run that relationship. It's so inappropriate that he's butting in the way he is. \n\nYou can't go on some scorched earth campaign every time your IL does or says something that you don't understand. Marriages just don't work like that.

I love my niblings to death and always watch them a couple of hours every week for free to help. But because it was just a continuous week with no breaks and she knows we\u2019re not well off, she provided us with some money so we could grocery shop and take the kids out to do something fun. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for MIL to ask for money for that, especially if she needs it and is using it on her grandson! She should have brought it up sooner though if it was that much of an issue.", "Ha! Her worth for a whole week of sitting", "I get this, but his parents offer a much easier solution and the MIL is exhibiting manipulative behavior by accusing her daughter of keeping her grandson from her.

They should have allowed you **choice** and **transparency**. When you called initially to ask the favor, they should have said, \"Sure, I'll pick you up!
