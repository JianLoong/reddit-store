We got married and soon started having problems with household chores. We both work full time, I work from home and he doesn't, but I still expected to split the tasks equally. But he started complaining about it, and it got on my nerves, he's a grown man who lived completely well before me, he can do the housework just as well as I can.\n\nYesterday I finally said \"enough\", I sat down with him and asked him the motivation behind the constant complaints, we talked about divisions of duties as soon as we got back from our honeymoon and I was confused. And he replied that he didn't know how to say this once we had this conversation, but that every day he feels more betrayed because I lied about who I was when we were dating. When I visited him, I did everything at home to help him because I wanted to take care of him during our time together, and he said that he feels trapped in a marriage with someone who turned out to be different, and that he has lost trust in me because I showed myself to be a manipulative liar.\n\nI'm feeling down as I understand, in hindsight, what my actions on my visits conveyed to him about our future life together, but at the same time I don't know if I am the AH, I feel it's unfair of him to expect me to be responsible for everything in OUR house.\n\nWhat is my judgment?

Excuse me? He feels manipulated? No. Absolutely not. If anything, you thought you were marrying someone who would be a partner, and so far he\u2019s doing a piss-poor job of that. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou both work equally and thus it makes sense to split the chores equally.\n\nYour husband is TA for expecting you to do everything or most chores just because you\u2018re now married. It seems like he married you to be his nanny.\n\nHe isn\u2019t ready to be a good husband unless he\u2018s willing to put equal effort into your relationship, INCLUDING household chores!", "NTA he got married he didn't hire a maid! I'm going to have to disagree with people saying Y T A / E S H because your spouse expecting you to split the housework 50/50 is not an evil manipulative gaslighter. Yes you both made assumptions without having a discussion first but the difference is that you made the assumption that you would both be equals while he made the assumption that you would be his live in maid.", "NTA. He's a lazy jerk. Of course you were on your best behavior when dating because that's what you're supposed to do when dating. On what planet did he think it was okay for him to do 0% instead of 50% of the chores after marriage? Is he earning 100% of the money????", "NTA- Run. Promise you, it only gets worse.", "NTA. I don't feel like you intentionally misrepresented yourself. People are often a bit different in the beginning of their relationships especially when visiting for the first time etc.  Living together is a whole different ballgame and takes adjustment from both sides.", "NTA.  Divorce the loser.", "NTA\n\nThis is why people should never get married before living together.", "NTA.  Sounds like he's pissed that he didn't get the maid with benefits that he thought he was getting.  Probably a good idea to reconsider the marriage.", "NTA. Everybody puts in more effort and does extra when they're dating. It's natural. It's silly of him to assume you'd just be his maid forever.\n\nIt is, however, remarkably dumb of both of you to get married without ever having lived together. You really don't know a person until you live with them.", "NTA for this particular problem. However, you guys entered the marriage not knowing each other at all. This should not surprise you and yet, here you are. Better start from the beginning with your spouse and see where it takes you.", "WOW. Just by reading the headline I assumed you kept some big secret from him. I don't think it was realistic of him to expect things would be exactly like they were when you'd visit him once in a while, actually living together and sharing a life definitely comes with its obstacles and it's not some perfect fantasy (as wonderful as it can be). You're not his maid, he's a grown man. Also lied about who you are? As if cleaning up after him is part of your personality? What a load of BS. And you said you actually sat down and talked about this yet somehow he's still surprised? He's the asshole, you're definitely NTA", "Nta talk about gaslighting lmao he flipped that on you so fast. He is the AH because he wants a mother not a wife. Leave before you have kids. You will thank everyone later. He is making you feel guilty about nothing because you are tired just like he is after work. When you visited you weren\u2019t working and had the free time. That sounds like he trapped you. He is the liar because he reneged on a agreement because he is lazy.", "INFO: what do you mean you didn\u2019t have much face-to-face time with the person you were going to marry? How often did you see each other? How long were you together?", "nta - he wanted a maid not a partner. and now he wants out and turning the tables on you by saying u lied to him.  however by him saying this he is also showing his true self.", "NTA. Would he have even married you if he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be a maid for him? He\u2019s a grown man and can help out around the house. It would be one thing if he offered to do some stuff but still ask you to do the majority (it wouldn\u2019t be okay, but slightly more acceptable) but basically saying you have to do EVERYTHING is not okay!", "NTA. He expected an unpaid maid with side benefits, not a partner for life. He's an ass and an idiot. The wedding was recent enough that it should be easier to separate you assets in the divorce.", "NTA. He expected to get a house slave or a bang-maid and instead he got someone who can think for themselves and call him out on his laziness.  Guess you aren\u2019t compatible after all.", "Honestly. Getting married before living together is a terrible idea. These are kinks that need to be worked out before a supposed life long commitment.", "NTA. You were a guest at his house and wanted to help. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s manipulative since you still clean and do chores (just not everything). I do think esh because you clearly didn\u2019t know each other before getting married. How to run your home is one of the first conversations you should\u2019ve had while engaged. I hope you guys can have a smooth divorce or a good couple therapy session. Good luck", "NTA, if your boyfriend brings you flowers on every date while courting, would you expect flowers everyday or once a month to show his appreciation? Same for dates, he may take you out twice a week, but once you live together the dates could happen twice a month? That's life. Dating is showcasing your best self (especially when being long distance), that is why people try living together prior or court for longer periods as time reveals all...", "NTA. What's his commute, like 90 minutes round trip? Ok, that's the difference in how many chores the two of you should do, max. But it isn't really about that, he wanted a housewife (in addition to your income), and he's throwing a tantrum about not having one. He sounds considerably more manipulative than you!", "ESH for not discussing expectations before getting married and moving in together. He sucks a little more for expecting that housework is all on you. It doesn't seem like you lied, unless you explicitly told him he would never have to lift a finger. Doing nice things for someone is pretty normal, especially if you were taking time off work during your visits, extra effort around the house is a little easier than when you're working. \n\nUltimately though, getting married without either living together or having some really frank and open discussions about expectations is usually a recipe for disaster.", "NTA.  He is gaslighting you by turning this on you and saying that you are manipulative and a liar (the cheek of him). It is one thing to help out a few weekends while you are visiting. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that day in and day out. If anything, you can say he misrepresented himself - you thought you www marrying a guy who was fully self sufficient, and instead you got a whiny misogynistic baby. \n\nYou both work full time, so it\u2019s not as if he is the only earner. So then what exactly is he doing to be a good partner? It\u2019s an equal partnership. Full stop. And if he is not doing his share of domestic work, then he is slacking and contributing less while you are doing basically everything. Don\u2019t let him fool you with all his word play - he wants you to do far more work while he sits back. That\u2019s not the sign of a supportive and loving partner.", "NTA, but let this be a lesson to always start the way you mean to go on- my 94 year old grandma taught me that. If you start a relationship by making someone\u2019s lunch every day, it\u2019s going to be an issue when you don\u2019t. \n\nWhen you were visiting, were you on time off, or were you working from his place? If you were on time off, then you need to remind him that you were able to do all that because you were not working when you were there. That the only way that you would be able to do that again would be if you were no longer working, and he was the true breadwinner who covered all the finances including your previous debts, a weekly \u2018fun money\u2019 amount for you, and was covering all of the bills. Of course, now that you\u2019ve seen HIS real behaviour, you can\u2019t consider doing that, because clearly he is an ass and you need your job more than ever for security reasons. Let him marinate on that for a while, while you decide if you want out now or if you still want to try. Unless he is willing to pitch in I\u2019d walk- it\u2019s one thing to both agree on one person staying home and handling the house, but it needs a set agreement and rules and it would be at least three years before I would be willing to risk it because of his behaviour.", "ESH- if you both don\u2019t know how to communicate, I\u2019m not sure marriage was the right choice", "ESH. So you guys didn't have any conversation at all about living together and expectations? You both suck for that.\n\nAlso for the record, everyone puts their best foot forward in the beginning of a relationship and when you're long distance that can extend until you're living together. He's extra TA for thinking that you purposefully tried to trick him.", "ESH, you shouldn't have married when you don't really know who it is you're marrying. Going from long distance to marriage immediately was obviously a big mistake. You're not compatible, that much is obvious. Get a divorce, I don't see this working out.", "Completely unrealistic to think you would be doing all the domestic chores. \n\n What is disturbing is how he flipped that conversation into you being a liar.   Problem is, you can't win with him or even compromise because he will flip all conversations and distort the truth.    He already has you questioning your own integrity and that is a major red flag.  \n\nIf you go to couples therapy, he will just twist things more and use what is said there against you. \n\nNow, before more time passes seriously need to decide what is best for you.  Go get therapy for yourself and make a plan to leave him.", "ESH- \n\nshould have been discussed before the marriage, along with things like finances and kids", "ESH. This was a discussion you should have had WAY BEFORE moving in together and getting married. \n\nYou both assumed things. You both assumed wrong.", "NTA. You were a guest visiting his home. Of course you did more then. Did he only marry you so you\u2019d cook and clean for him?", "NTA.\n\nSomeone who loves you doesn't feel betrayed because he has to do the dishes.   \nHe wanted to have a maid and not a wife.", "NTA. \n\nBut to anyone engaged reading this for the love of God discuss EVERYTHING before you get married. This isn\u2019t one of those things that should have slipped through the cracks.", "NTA\u2014 I have a gay friend who had a boyfriend who had been married to a woman, kids, everything, but snuck out to have fun  and wild gay experiences while wife did the housework and cared for the kids. Finally divorced the wife and moved in with my friend. And one day in that first week they were washing dishes and he whines, \u201cThis is boring! This is like being married!\u201d Like only straight women whine at men to wash the dishes with them, gay men call their fairy godfathers! \n\nUnless someone is fabulously wealthy or finds a real sucker who brings home a pay check and has OCD and loves cleaning, a person is going to have to do housework. Screw him for thinking you were that sucker. \n\nSo what that when you were dating you acted like someone who is dating! I bet you don\u2019t wear a push-up bra and full makeup to bed, either. \n\nHe\u2019s an idiot and a user and should go back to his mommy who loves to spoil him.", "NTA. He misunderstood care on your occasional visits to be a commitment to that division of labor when life together became permanent. Lots of couples find things are different than they expected or previously experienced when they start living together. His assumptions don\u2019t constitute you lying.", "Honestly, if anyone should feel betrayed it's you, because you appear to have married an entitled asshole who thinks manipulation and emotional blackmail are tools to get your own way. \n\nI'd also be wondering why he thinks it's specifically your job to do everything around the house, as well as working full time.", "NTA you didn\u2019t \u201cmanipulate\u201d him.

I was a lot tidier and cleaned a lot more, but I did explain to him that im not a naturally tidy person and that I'm maintaining his home to his standard. So there weren't any surprises.\n\nAlthough your partner should not expect the majority of the household chores to be on you as you both work full time, it should be divided 'equally'.", "NAH. It's reasonable to expect things to change when you get married, and reasonable to expect more or less the same person you dated.

You guys should have a conversation about girls and values and literally how day-to-day living is going to work very soon and decide if you want a divorce.\n\nThe longer you stay married the harder it's going to be to disentangle yourself from the other person when you realize you hold incompatible goals and values.", "Nta", "ESH.

Once you were married, you thought that you could stop, that, since the ring was on your finger, there was no need to impress him.\n\nThat really feeds into the notion that, to women, the ring is more important than the husband. \n\nAs others have said, open honest communication is as important before the marriage than it is afterwards. Phrasing what you did as deceptive advertising is insulting to you. But you did conceal from him what being married to you would be like.\n\nLong distance is very lousy way to decide if that is the person you want to live with and partner with for the rest of your lives.\n\nI'm going with NAH, because no one was mean, deceptive or an asshole.

Nta\n\nI will say though, it feels like you don't get to know each other well enough before getting married. Long distance and relationships that start online have a weird dynamic. You leanlrn so many intimate details about each other but you don't know basic things....like how they like their coffee or if they like coffee. Moving from long distance or online to in person is a major adjustment. Getting married before you truly get to know the day to day about each other just adds a lot more stress and can definitely lead to buyers remorse when you realize the difference in someone day to day from long distance \n\nMy husband and I met playing an mmorpg.

Splitting chores??? Yeah I get talking about kids or finances, but housework should be split equally. One person performing ALL the domestic labor is just not sustainable for a marriage. It\u2019s not fair and puts the weight on one persons shoulders, and especially in this case where OP ALSO WORKS FULL TIME.

You *did* misrepresent yourself to him and got married under false pretenses.  Sorry but facts are facts.", "I guess he sucks more but ESH for basically doing everything they could to have this exact argument in some form or another by refusing to live together before marriage.  That's \"walking off a cliff and expecting to fly\" crazy IMO", "Yea sounds more like he\u2019s trying to manipulate you in to being his servant. Taking care of your partner while they\u2019re at your house is just a nice thing to do. He took that wayyyyy out of context AND ignored the actual discussions you had about it. the only person who hid their intentions and true self was ur husband. Him acting like you tricked him is gaslighting, ya? Because you\u2019re the one actually getting fucked over here , as per your spoken agreements.", "This is like a man getting married and no longer paying for everything and wanting some joint financial responsibility.  That's how a partnership works.  It seems like OP's husband is openly admitting that OP's courtesy is supposed to be an obligation to be exploited.\n\nNo, that's not how it works.", "Exactly, he's just mad that he didn't get a bangmaid and now he has to pull his weight like actual partners do.", "Annulment might still be an option", "Especially in an LDR situation. Seeing someone once every three months is not enough to get to know how they really are irl.", "Interestingly enough, statistically couples that live together before marriage are more likely to divorce than those who do not.", "NTA. But he is pinning your entire character on your unwillingness to do all the the chores?! Calling you a manipulative liar is a bit much. Maybe some counseling will help you both get back on track.", "Yeah, I think I\u2019ve been on reddit too much and thought she would reveal she had stalked him or something similar from the title.\n\nNope, this is just a dude thinking he found himself back in the 1950s. OP is NTA but this should have been discussed and resolved before marriage.", "Yeah, the way that he's talking to her just screams misogynist with a warped idea of what married women should do and be like.

We saw each other every three months or so, usually for a week.", "that's how we do it, too. the partner working from home does *slightly* more chores, because they have more free time. and it's still like a 60/40 division, so not vastly inequal. \n\ni would be very, very uncomfortable if i was not pulling my own weight.", "I genuinely don't understand how someone could do that without it being some form of sabotage.  I'm **not** accusing OP or husband of that, to be clear, it's honestly more of a \"I'm not even mad, I'm impressed\" at what a terrible idea that is and that two grown adults agreed to it.", "Are you for real with that vote?

Either way they discussed division of chores before the honeymoon was over and even beyond that WHY DOES THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED BETWEEN TWO ADULTS?????????

I don't follow your logic.", "Not even close. Of all the things couples should discuss before getting married or moving in together, household chores ranks pretty low. So many other things are way more important. This is a simple oversight and hardly worth assessing OP as at fault too.", "Right? Y\u2019all never lived together before getting married? Is this the 60s???", "What? How did you get to that conclusion?", "Read the post again and try to comprehend if that\u2019s not too hard on your brain. She clearly said she expected to split chores.

Which to me makes sense since the only people I\u2019ve known who don\u2019t live together before marriage have religious reasons for it. And if you\u2019re very religious, I imagine you\u2019d be less inclined to pursue a divorce, even if you\u2019re just as unhappy as someone who did live with their spouse before marriage.
