We got married and soon started having problems with household chores. We both work full time, I work from home and he doesn't, but I still expected to split the tasks equally. But he started complaining about it, and it got on my nerves, he's a grown man who lived completely well before me, he can do the housework just as well as I can.\n\nYesterday I finally said \"enough\", I sat down with him and asked him the motivation behind the constant complaints, we talked about divisions of duties as soon as we got back from our honeymoon and I was confused. And he replied that he didn't know how to say this once we had this conversation, but that every day he feels more betrayed because I lied about who I was when we were dating. When I visited him, I did everything at home to help him because I wanted to take care of him during our time together, and he said that he feels trapped in a marriage with someone who turned out to be different, and that he has lost trust in me because I showed myself to be a manipulative liar.\n\nI'm feeling down as I understand, in hindsight, what my actions on my visits conveyed to him about our future life together, but at the same time I don't know if I am the AH, I feel it's unfair of him to expect me to be responsible for everything in OUR house.\n\nWhat is my judgment?

Excuse me? He feels manipulated? No. Absolutely not. If anything, you thought you were marrying someone who would be a partner, and so far he\u2019s doing a piss-poor job of that. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou both work equally and thus it makes sense to split the chores equally.\n\nYour husband is TA for expecting you to do everything or most chores just because you\u2018re now married. It seems like he married you to be his nanny.\n\nHe isn\u2019t ready to be a good husband unless he\u2018s willing to put equal effort into your relationship, INCLUDING household chores!", "NTA he got married he didn't hire a maid! I'm going to have to disagree with people saying Y T A / E S H because your spouse expecting you to split the housework 50/50 is not an evil manipulative gaslighter. Yes you both made assumptions without having a discussion first but the difference is that you made the assumption that you would both be equals while he made the assumption that you would be his live in maid.", "NTA. He's a lazy jerk. Of course you were on your best behavior when dating because that's what you're supposed to do when dating. On what planet did he think it was okay for him to do 0% instead of 50% of the chores after marriage? Is he earning 100% of the money????", "NTA- Run. Promise you, it only gets worse.", "NTA. I don't feel like you intentionally misrepresented yourself. People are often a bit different in the beginning of their relationships especially when visiting for the first time etc.  Living together is a whole different ballgame and takes adjustment from both sides.", "NTA.  Divorce the loser.", "NTA\n\nThis is why people should never get married before living together.", "NTA.  Sounds like he's pissed that he didn't get the maid with benefits that he thought he was getting.  Probably a good idea to reconsider the marriage.", "NTA. Everybody puts in more effort and does extra when they're dating. It's natural. It's silly of him to assume you'd just be his maid forever.\n\nIt is, however, remarkably dumb of both of you to get married without ever having lived together. You really don't know a person until you live with them.", "NTA for this particular problem. However, you guys entered the marriage not knowing each other at all. This should not surprise you and yet, here you are. Better start from the beginning with your spouse and see where it takes you.", "WOW. Just by reading the headline I assumed you kept some big secret from him. I don't think it was realistic of him to expect things would be exactly like they were when you'd visit him once in a while, actually living together and sharing a life definitely comes with its obstacles and it's not some perfect fantasy (as wonderful as it can be). You're not his maid, he's a grown man. Also lied about who you are? As if cleaning up after him is part of your personality? What a load of BS. And you said you actually sat down and talked about this yet somehow he's still surprised? He's the asshole, you're definitely NTA", "Nta talk about gaslighting lmao he flipped that on you so fast. He is the AH because he wants a mother not a wife. Leave before you have kids. You will thank everyone later. He is making you feel guilty about nothing because you are tired just like he is after work. When you visited you weren\u2019t working and had the free time. That sounds like he trapped you. He is the liar because he reneged on a agreement because he is lazy.", "INFO: what do you mean you didn\u2019t have much face-to-face time with the person you were going to marry? How often did you see each other? How long were you together?", "nta - he wanted a maid not a partner. and now he wants out and turning the tables on you by saying u lied to him.  however by him saying this he is also showing his true self.", "NTA. Would he have even married you if he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be a maid for him? He\u2019s a grown man and can help out around the house. It would be one thing if he offered to do some stuff but still ask you to do the majority (it wouldn\u2019t be okay, but slightly more acceptable) but basically saying you have to do EVERYTHING is not okay!", "NTA. He expected an unpaid maid with side benefits, not a partner for life. He's an ass and an idiot. The wedding was recent enough that it should be easier to separate you assets in the divorce.", "NTA. He expected to get a house slave or a bang-maid and instead he got someone who can think for themselves and call him out on his laziness.  Guess you aren\u2019t compatible after all.", "Honestly. Getting married before living together is a terrible idea. These are kinks that need to be worked out before a supposed life long commitment.", "NTA. You were a guest at his house and wanted to help. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s manipulative since you still clean and do chores (just not everything). I do think esh because you clearly didn\u2019t know each other before getting married. How to run your home is one of the first conversations you should\u2019ve had while engaged. I hope you guys can have a smooth divorce or a good couple therapy session. Good luck", "NTA, if your boyfriend brings you flowers on every date while courting, would you expect flowers everyday or once a month to show his appreciation? Same for dates, he may take you out twice a week, but once you live together the dates could happen twice a month? That's life. Dating is showcasing your best self (especially when being long distance), that is why people try living together prior or court for longer periods as time reveals all...", "NTA. What's his commute, like 90 minutes round trip? Ok, that's the difference in how many chores the two of you should do, max. But it isn't really about that, he wanted a housewife (in addition to your income), and he's throwing a tantrum about not having one. He sounds considerably more manipulative than you!", "ESH for not discussing expectations before getting married and moving in together. He sucks a little more for expecting that housework is all on you. It doesn't seem like you lied, unless you explicitly told him he would never have to lift a finger. Doing nice things for someone is pretty normal, especially if you were taking time off work during your visits, extra effort around the house is a little easier than when you're working. \n\nUltimately though, getting married without either living together or having some really frank and open discussions about expectations is usually a recipe for disaster.", "NTA.  He is gaslighting you by turning this on you and saying that you are manipulative and a liar (the cheek of him). It is one thing to help out a few weekends while you are visiting. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that day in and day out. If anything, you can say he misrepresented himself - you thought you www marrying a guy who was fully self sufficient, and instead you got a whiny misogynistic baby. \n\nYou both work full time, so it\u2019s not as if he is the only earner. So then what exactly is he doing to be a good partner? It\u2019s an equal partnership. Full stop. And if he is not doing his share of domestic work, then he is slacking and contributing less while you are doing basically everything. Don\u2019t let him fool you with all his word play - he wants you to do far more work while he sits back. That\u2019s not the sign of a supportive and loving partner.", "NTA, but let this be a lesson to always start the way you mean to go on- my 94 year old grandma taught me that. If you start a relationship by making someone\u2019s lunch every day, it\u2019s going to be an issue when you don\u2019t. \n\nWhen you were visiting, were you on time off, or were you working from his place? If you were on time off, then you need to remind him that you were able to do all that because you were not working when you were there. That the only way that you would be able to do that again would be if you were no longer working, and he was the true breadwinner who covered all the finances including your previous debts, a weekly \u2018fun money\u2019 amount for you, and was covering all of the bills. Of course, now that you\u2019ve seen HIS real behaviour, you can\u2019t consider doing that, because clearly he is an ass and you need your job more than ever for security reasons. Let him marinate on that for a while, while you decide if you want out now or if you still want to try. Unless he is willing to pitch in I\u2019d walk- it\u2019s one thing to both agree on one person staying home and handling the house, but it needs a set agreement and rules and it would be at least three years before I would be willing to risk it because of his behaviour.", "ESH- if you both don\u2019t know how to communicate, I\u2019m not sure marriage was the right choice", "ESH. So you guys didn't have any conversation at all about living together and expectations? You both suck for that.\n\nAlso for the record, everyone puts their best foot forward in the beginning of a relationship and when you're long distance that can extend until you're living together. He's extra TA for thinking that you purposefully tried to trick him.", "ESH, you shouldn't have married when you don't really know who it is you're marrying. Going from long distance to marriage immediately was obviously a big mistake. You're not compatible, that much is obvious. Get a divorce, I don't see this working out.", "Completely unrealistic to think you would be doing all the domestic chores. \n\n What is disturbing is how he flipped that conversation into you being a liar.   Problem is, you can't win with him or even compromise because he will flip all conversations and distort the truth.    He already has you questioning your own integrity and that is a major red flag.  \n\nIf you go to couples therapy, he will just twist things more and use what is said there against you. \n\nNow, before more time passes seriously need to decide what is best for you.  Go get therapy for yourself and make a plan to leave him.", "ESH- \n\nshould have been discussed before the marriage, along with things like finances and kids", "ESH. This was a discussion you should have had WAY BEFORE moving in together and getting married. \n\nYou both assumed things. You both assumed wrong.", "NTA. You were a guest visiting his home. Of course you did more then. Did he only marry you so you\u2019d cook and clean for him?", "NTA.\n\nSomeone who loves you doesn't feel betrayed because he has to do the dishes.   \nHe wanted to have a maid and not a wife.", "NTA. \n\nBut to anyone engaged reading this for the love of God discuss EVERYTHING before you get married. This isn\u2019t one of those things that should have slipped through the cracks.", "NTA\u2014 I have a gay friend who had a boyfriend who had been married to a woman, kids, everything, but snuck out to have fun  and wild gay experiences while wife did the housework and cared for the kids. Finally divorced the wife and moved in with my friend. And one day in that first week they were washing dishes and he whines, \u201cThis is boring! This is like being married!\u201d Like only straight women whine at men to wash the dishes with them, gay men call their fairy godfathers! \n\nUnless someone is fabulously wealthy or finds a real sucker who brings home a pay check and has OCD and loves cleaning, a person is going to have to do housework. Screw him for thinking you were that sucker. \n\nSo what that when you were dating you acted like someone who is dating! I bet you don\u2019t wear a push-up bra and full makeup to bed, either. \n\nHe\u2019s an idiot and a user and should go back to his mommy who loves to spoil him.", "NTA. He misunderstood care on your occasional visits to be a commitment to that division of labor when life together became permanent. Lots of couples find things are different than they expected or previously experienced when they start living together. His assumptions don\u2019t constitute you lying.", "Honestly, if anyone should feel betrayed it's you, because you appear to have married an entitled asshole who thinks manipulation and emotional blackmail are tools to get your own way. \n\nI'd also be wondering why he thinks it's specifically your job to do everything around the house, as well as working full time.", "NTA you didn\u2019t \u201cmanipulate\u201d him.

He is a grown ass man and he shouldn\u2019t play the victim when he tried to manipulate you for playing the perfect good wife that he picture himself when he can\u2019t be a descent husband for you! \nMy Gosh what a idiot !!", "ESH. Did you guys ever talk to each other while you were dating? These things should've been ironed out before you went and made it expensive to leave. Good luck with the divorce", "ESH. This is a great example of why I\u2019m a big believer in cohabitation.", "ESH - only because a conversation should have been had about expectations and domesticated duties before being married. \n\nAlthough not married, I was the same with my partner when I stayed at his house. I was a lot tidier and cleaned a lot more, but I did explain to him that im not a naturally tidy person and that I'm maintaining his home to his standard. So there weren't any surprises.\n\nAlthough your partner should not expect the majority of the household chores to be on you as you both work full time, it should be divided 'equally'.", "NAH. It's reasonable to expect things to change when you get married, and reasonable to expect more or less the same person you dated.

Also, this is why you should live together with someone before you jump into marriage.", "ESH - you literally FAFO by not having any discussion about how things in your married life were going to work before jumping into the very huge commitment marriage is.\n\nAdditionally, his expectation of you taking on all the workload is reason enough to get divorced. You guys should have a conversation about girls and values and literally how day-to-day living is going to work very soon and decide if you want a divorce.\n\nThe longer you stay married the harder it's going to be to disentangle yourself from the other person when you realize you hold incompatible goals and values.", "Nta", "ESH.

He's not your dad He's your husband, he needs support too.", "You did your best to impress and please him before marriage. Once you were married, you thought that you could stop, that, since the ring was on your finger, there was no need to impress him.\n\nThat really feeds into the notion that, to women, the ring is more important than the husband. \n\nAs others have said, open honest communication is as important before the marriage than it is afterwards. Phrasing what you did as deceptive advertising is insulting to you. But you did conceal from him what being married to you would be like.\n\nLong distance is very lousy way to decide if that is the person you want to live with and partner with for the rest of your lives.\n\nI'm going with NAH, because no one was mean, deceptive or an asshole.

Nta\n\nI will say though, it feels like you don't get to know each other well enough before getting married. Long distance and relationships that start online have a weird dynamic. You leanlrn so many intimate details about each other but you don't know basic things....like how they like their coffee or if they like coffee. Moving from long distance or online to in person is a major adjustment.

Splitting chores??? Yeah I get talking about kids or finances, but housework should be split equally. One person performing ALL the domestic labor is just not sustainable for a marriage. It\u2019s not fair and puts the weight on one persons shoulders, and especially in this case where OP ALSO WORKS FULL TIME.

Good luck!", "Fair enough - I\u2019m thinking of things like \u201ci like cooking\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like cooking - if you cook tonight i\u2019ll\u2026.\u201d  Or \u201cno - I always do by own laundry because I work around toxic chemicals.\u201d\n\nBut I never got married without living together first - so you couldn\u2019t miss this.", "So you\u2019ve never had a successful long-term relationship, but can\u2019t understand why two adults shouldn\u2019t discuss the division of household chores before moving in together?\n\nIt sounds to me like you\u2019re giving advice without actually knowing what you\u2019re talking about.", "Fair point. I also discovered when I went source searching that the full picture is significantly more complicated than I thought. I\u2019m going to edit my comment to reflect that.", "Makes sense that they wouldn't divorce though, it's much more frowned upon in their culture.", "I didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m just saying that not everyone who doesn\u2019t live together before marriage is conservative or religious.", "The issue with conversation ONLY is that a lot of people lie, minimize or exagerate or/and don't know themselves enough. \n\nThey tend to show their best side to their partner. \n\nI will always chose actions over words cause your behavior cannot lie that long.", "> if he wants the \u201cyou\u201d when you were visiting AND NOT WORKING your regular hours\u2026fine\u2026he can be the breadwinner. Set up a SAHP relationship with a household allowance and your personal allowance and divide up chores that way.\n\nThis is horrible advice! Why are you asking for OP to be financially dependent on a man like this because he wants someone to do his chores?? If the husband says \u201cyeah that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to work\u201d do you really think OP should then give up her career and quit her job to do all the chores for this man? Wtf \n\nNo one would give this advice to a man to quit his job if his wife doesn\u2019t do her share of housework.", "You seem to know a lot about being married?", "If husband lied to her about his expectations in the discussion after the honeymoon, why suppose he would be honest during the engagement?", "> we talked about divisions of duties as soon as we got back from our honeymoon", "How do you come out the gate with such an assumption like I could\u2019ve fixed my wording but I\u2019m still with the one I don\u2019t live with like you also do not know what you are talking about here sorry I choose partners who don\u2019t need to spend hours dwelling on who cleans what", "Kudos to you!", "Do you understand the meaning of the word \"majority\"? Because this is the comment you replied to.\n\n>I\u2019m gonna guess that\u2019s because the **majority** of them are conservative/religious and don\u2019t believe in divorce.\n\nedit: emphasis, mine", "Of course not, no one said otherwise. People who are conservative/religious are more likely to wait until marriage to move in together. That doesn't mean everyone who waits is. It's a Venn diagram with a lot of overlap", "They didn\u2019t talk at all during the engagement that\u2019s the problem. He assumed that she would be doing most of the household work, she assumed it would be more equal. \n\nI\u2019m guessing OP brought up division of labor when they first moved in together (after the honeymoon) and the husband didn\u2019t want to make waves about it but he was thrown off and surprised.", "How? Because Your comments read as if you\u2019ve never had a successful or meaningful long-term relationship, so I\u2019m calling out your bullshit.", "And anybody who takes lunch to work dirties an equivalent number of dishes in preparing / transporting that. The only new dishes would be maybe a coffee or water glass since those would be cleaned at the office.", "Maybe read as that but I consider my relationship pretty long term lmaoo. Not sure what you consider a successful relationship but we\u2019re doing fine over here. This is a really silly thing to argue back and forth over, thinking what you want won\u2019t change the reality so it\u2019s okay. As I said, splitting chores shouldn\u2019t be this big of a deal", "So you should have said before DECIDING to move in together. That is not what you said though.", "i can't find a polite way to ask this, so here goes. \n\ndo you not habitually clean up after yourself as you go about your life? do you use a knife and just leave it on the counter? do you drop your socks on the floor instead of tossing them into the hamper? you get toothpaste on the sink and let it stick there to harden?\n\nbecause my house we do tidy after ourselves, and it does not get *incredibly messy* on weekends when we're all at home."]}
