He presented her with a tiny daisy and was very nervous asking her but I found it very sweet. She asked me (45M) and my wife/her mom Mary (44F) if one of us could take her to the cinema if Alex came with his mom Betty. My wife said it was fine but wanted my daughter to have her brother Mark (10) tag along. He also wanted to see the new Avatar movie but Emily said no, she just wanted it to be her, Alex, his mom and either me or my wife. My wife tried to say that Emily should be a good big sister and let Mark tag along and she refused. My wife then tried to ban Emily from going and I said absolutely not. Emily was asked, she is going and that id take her myself. My wife tried to pressure me into taking Mark and I refused. I explained to Mark that I\u2019ll happily take him to see the film another time, but that he needs to understand that sometimes he can\u2019t tag along to things and that only his sister was invited and that he cant always tag along to thing she\u2019s doing and that it would be the same for her and any activity he was doing. He was upset but I think he understood.\n\nAnyway, I went the other night with Emily. She sat in a seat beside Alex and they shared food and popcorn whilst Betty and I sat in the row behind them. The kids enjoyed themselves and even talked about hanging out again. I think they either have little crushes on each other or are developing a sweet friendship. Either way the outing was a success.\n\nWhen I got home, my wife berated me and said I was playing favourites with the kids and purposely excluding my son. She accused me of not loving my son enough and that I could have easily taken him along. I told her again that only Emily was invited and that my son won\u2019t always be invited to things my daughter is at. Mary says that just this once I could have let him go as he wants to see the film. I said I can literally take him or she can and she said that\u2019s not the point. In her eyes, I should have sucked it up and brought my son along even though I told her he needs to learn that he can\u2019t always be there and needs to accept Emily will want to do things on her own without my son also being there. I also said it\u2019s not a discussion of love. I love both my kids the same but Emily was asked by Alex, my son wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: this is weird behaviour from my wife. She\u2019s never forced Mark to hang out with Emily before like this and she\u2019s never forced Emily to hang out with Mark. Both have separate friend groups and this is a first. My wife\u2019s parents are lovely and she was never pushed to the side or anything growing up as a child. She had boundaries of course but they were normal. I don\u2019t know why she is being so forceful or pushy. Perhaps it\u2019s an isolated incident and that she just wanted a night to herself but idk. I\u2019m going to talk to her when I can and yes, I will be taking Mark to see Avatar soon and I\u2019m going to find out what\u2019s going on with my wife and make her see she needs to apologise and make up with Emily.\n\nETA 2: my wife has been coming across as stressed and overwhelmed lately and has made casual mentions on the past few months about some of her friends displaying symptoms of the menopause. My wife has complained about not feeling great sometimes so this may be a coincidence but idk. She has never gone into great detail about this but I think I\u2019ll talk to her.", "created_utc": 1673526701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109yjqn/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_son_to_the_cinema/", "score": 1668, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is growing up and doesnt need to drag her little brother along everywhere she goes, especially on dates. If your wife keeps this up, she will create resentment between siblings where there currently is none. The offer to take your son to see the movie at another time was the correct answer.\n\n\n\nEdited for clarity and spelling.", "NTA. I'm the youngest of 3 and even i understood that my sisters had their friends to do things with and i had my friends to hang out with. \n\nIt's okay for siblings to do things without eachother and at the end of the day, it isn't yours or your daughter's place to invite someone along to something they weren't invited to.", "NTA. you were basically asked to chaperone a date. I wouldn\u2019t want my siblings to tag along on a date either. Boundaries!", "Nta\n\n\nYour wife wanted a night on her own with no kids at home and made a whole backstory to vilify you.", "NTA. You did the right thing and your wife is basically teaching your son that whining is going to get him whatever he wants. She\u2019s going to eventually make your daughter resent him and that\u2019s not ok.", "NTA, parenting done right! This isn\u2019t about playing favourites, it\u2019s about introducing your daughter into a new chapter in her life. Whether the boy had romantic intentions or not, this sounds a lot like a date. Bringing your little brother along is not a great first step. I think you handled this situation perfectly, and your wife needs to calm down. She very easily could have taken Alex herself a different day and made a big deal out of it for him.", "NTA. You're absolutely right to say that your son needs to understand he can't always be included in everything that happens, & he seems to grasp that fact of life better than your wife does.", "NTA it was a date. (I know it's a bit of a weird word to use for 11 year olds but I guess it's an 11 year olds version of that) and you don't take your siblings along to those...", "NTA and I'm glad to see a dad stand up for his little girl, your wife is enabling a little entitled monster if she keeps this up", "NTA. Taking your son to your daughter's outing would have been playing favorites, not the other way around.", "Nta. Just to get the verdict out of the way first.\n\nDude, your wife seriously has the most warped logic I have ever heard. Your daughter is invited to watch a movie with a guy. What's the brother got to tag along for? To be a street lamp on the side? You literally just told her you are open to the idea of taking your son alone to watch Avatar some time down the line and her response is that 'That's not the point?'.\n\nUh - except it is the point. Her argument of you playing favorites is predicated on the absence of your son attending a movie date that doesn't warrant his presence (which, for some reason, she thinks it does because inclusivity? Idk). So going by her argument, you can bring your son, alone, to the movies where the daughter's presence is not warranted and all of a sudden, you will be 'playing favorites' with your son. See? Cancels the favoritism out. According to her argument. \n\nWhere's the problem?", "NTA\n\nYour wife could have gotten off her ass and taken your son to another theater or to an earlier/later showing.  The easiest fix in the world was in her grasp, but she'd rather yell at you for this and, more importantly, deny your son a trip to see Avatar.", "NTA. Parents who think kids should always do exactly the same things all the time drive me bonkers. As kids grow up they have different interests and identities, and always forcing them to do things together only leads to resentment. You offered to take your son another time, so you were definitely not playing favorites.", "Nta\n\nIm glad you stood up for your daughter, your wife sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. He wasn't invited, simple as that. Besides, you said that you could take him another time, so I don't see the problem.", "NTA - this was the right thing to do. Also if your son wanted to see it so badly why is your wife waiting until your daughter was asked to see it? Why not take him on his own at any point in the last few weeks if shes that concerned.", "NTA. Your daughter was on a date. Siblings need the chance to be individuals. If your wife was so adamant your son see the movie she could have taken him", "NTA. You weren't playing favorites, you were merely not forcibly inserting your son into a social situation to which he was not invited.", "NTA.\n\n1. It wasn't an outing between friends, it was a date. A date with chaperones, but still. Where did the little brother fit in all that?\n2. You offered to bring the brother to the cinema at a later time. It was a good compromise. \n3. The brother does not have to be everywhere his sister is. She can have her life, friends, activities, etc. of her own.\n4. One does not bring uninvited parties to an event for the sake of \"fairness\". It's rude. \n5. She could have gone to the movies with her son, separately. There was no need to force you to force the brother to partake in the date.", "NTA you did the right thing. It sucks not being invited but that's life! Your wife can take him to the movie.", "NTA, it's your daughters date.  Take the boy on his own.", "Nta", "NTA. You didn't decide out of the blue (sorry, couldn't resist) to treat your daughter to a movie.  You decided to chaperone a movie to which your daughter had been invited.

You're a good dad for sticking up for your kid.", "NTA.  You handled this 100% correctly IMO.  Your son is not going to crash by  being told 'not today but soon'.  Your wife needs to understand both kids are not ONE child.  Both are individuals.  Bravo to you, OP.", "Absolutely NTA. Your daughter was asked out on a date! And you wife really expected her younger brother to tag along. You were definitely correct in not taking him. He sold enough to understand that\u2019s he\u2019s can\u2019t alway tag along. It would be better to take him for some father/son time anyway to go see the movie. Your wife\u2019s being ridiculous and it sounds like your son is her golden child and she\u2019s the one playing favorites here!", "NTA. You don't bring your brother on a date.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t about not living your son, it\u2019s about respecting your daughters boundaries and you did a great job. Wife is going to need to learn that both kids are going to do their own activities and playdates and not everything your daughter does is a joint event.

Did your wife get left out of things a lot as a child? She seems to be projecting? \n\nHonest question- why couldn\u2019t the other parent take Mark and sit in a different area of the theatre. So not interfering with his sisters date, but still able to go and enjoy the movie?\n\nMy judgement come from the idea that Emily and Mark will want to do things solo and the other does have to understand this.", "NTA, but now turn around and take your son to see the movie. I mean the same day or no later then the next day.", "NTA.\n\nI'm confused by your wife's logic.  Where does the line end?  Your daughter goes on dates, has to take her brother.  Your daughter gets engaged, better include her brother!  Getting married now, must include her brother!!\n\nThis isn't favoritism, it's... normal behavior?\n\nMaybe she wanted a day alone, maybe she doesn't want to admit that her daughter is growing up and going on cute dates.  Either way, she needs to understand that she's making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\nOut of curiosity, if your son was invited out by a friend or wanted to invite someone out, would he have to include his sister?", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But something is up with your wife. So I\u2019d dig into that.

Realistically you could have brought your son along, sat one or two rows further back, and not interrupted your daughter's date. My mom brought my younger siblings with her plenty of times when she was chaperoning my friends and I at the mall or at the movies and it was never an issue, so I know first hand it can be done if needed. And with the way your wife was really wanting y'all to take your son along, it sounds like she might be struggling and need some time to herself.

I think it was good for you to make this space for Emily and let Mark know that he should too. \n\nSounds like perhaps your wife was triggered by your daughter going out with a boy for the the first time, even though it was all very age appropriate and well supervised by you and his mom. Maybe ask her what upset her so much about this situation in particular, and, perhaps, to replay it with the friend being a girl and see if she would have reacted the same way. \n\nIf your wife can see a doctor and consider bioidentical HRT, that will probably make the next few years easier around your place - a daughter going through puberty and a mother going through menopause is a rough mix even in the most well-adjusted families.", "NTA\n\nIt was nice for you to take your daughter to see her friend for a movie and your right your son don't need to go where he wasn't invited.

Imagine if you make her brother go and he ruins it for her, she would then know that she has to try to meet boys secretly to avoid her brother coming along and that can lead to way worse things. Your wife needs to come to terms with this and understand that if she pushes on this issue, it will only cause resentment from her daughter, a rift between the siblings, and will give daughter reasons to want to be sneaky about this sort of thing in the future, causing her to get into potentially unsafe situations.
