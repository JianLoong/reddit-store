He presented her with a tiny daisy and was very nervous asking her but I found it very sweet. She asked me (45M) and my wife/her mom Mary (44F) if one of us could take her to the cinema if Alex came with his mom Betty. My wife said it was fine but wanted my daughter to have her brother Mark (10) tag along. He also wanted to see the new Avatar movie but Emily said no, she just wanted it to be her, Alex, his mom and either me or my wife. My wife tried to say that Emily should be a good big sister and let Mark tag along and she refused. My wife then tried to ban Emily from going and I said absolutely not. Emily was asked, she is going and that id take her myself. My wife tried to pressure me into taking Mark and I refused. I explained to Mark that I\u2019ll happily take him to see the film another time, but that he needs to understand that sometimes he can\u2019t tag along to things and that only his sister was invited and that he cant always tag along to thing she\u2019s doing and that it would be the same for her and any activity he was doing. He was upset but I think he understood.\n\nAnyway, I went the other night with Emily. She sat in a seat beside Alex and they shared food and popcorn whilst Betty and I sat in the row behind them. The kids enjoyed themselves and even talked about hanging out again. I think they either have little crushes on each other or are developing a sweet friendship. Either way the outing was a success.\n\nWhen I got home, my wife berated me and said I was playing favourites with the kids and purposely excluding my son. She accused me of not loving my son enough and that I could have easily taken him along. I told her again that only Emily was invited and that my son won\u2019t always be invited to things my daughter is at. Mary says that just this once I could have let him go as he wants to see the film. I said I can literally take him or she can and she said that\u2019s not the point. In her eyes, I should have sucked it up and brought my son along even though I told her he needs to learn that he can\u2019t always be there and needs to accept Emily will want to do things on her own without my son also being there. I also said it\u2019s not a discussion of love. I love both my kids the same but Emily was asked by Alex, my son wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: this is weird behaviour from my wife. She\u2019s never forced Mark to hang out with Emily before like this and she\u2019s never forced Emily to hang out with Mark. Both have separate friend groups and this is a first. My wife\u2019s parents are lovely and she was never pushed to the side or anything growing up as a child. She had boundaries of course but they were normal. I don\u2019t know why she is being so forceful or pushy. Perhaps it\u2019s an isolated incident and that she just wanted a night to herself but idk. I\u2019m going to talk to her when I can and yes, I will be taking Mark to see Avatar soon and I\u2019m going to find out what\u2019s going on with my wife and make her see she needs to apologise and make up with Emily.\n\nETA 2: my wife has been coming across as stressed and overwhelmed lately and has made casual mentions on the past few months about some of her friends displaying symptoms of the menopause. My wife has complained about not feeling great sometimes so this may be a coincidence but idk. She has never gone into great detail about this but I think I\u2019ll talk to her.", "created_utc": 1673526701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109yjqn/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_son_to_the_cinema/", "score": 567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is growing up and doesnt need to drag her little brother along everywhere she goes, especially on dates. If your wife keeps this up, she will create resentment between siblings where there currently is none.

I'm the youngest of 3 and even i understood that my sisters had their friends to do things with and i had my friends to hang out with. \n\nIt's okay for siblings to do things without eachother and at the end of the day, it isn't yours or your daughter's place to invite someone along to something they weren't invited to.", "NTA. you were basically asked to chaperone a date. I wouldn\u2019t want my siblings to tag along on a date either. Boundaries!", "Nta\n\n\nYour wife wanted a night on her own with no kids at home and made a whole backstory to vilify you.", "NTA. You did the right thing and your wife is basically teaching your son that whining is going to get him whatever he wants. She\u2019s going to eventually make your daughter resent him and that\u2019s not ok.", "NTA, parenting done right! This isn\u2019t about playing favourites, it\u2019s about introducing your daughter into a new chapter in her life. Whether the boy had romantic intentions or not, this sounds a lot like a date. Bringing your little brother along is not a great first step. I think you handled this situation perfectly, and your wife needs to calm down. She very easily could have taken Alex herself a different day and made a big deal out of it for him.", "NTA. You're absolutely right to say that your son needs to understand he can't always be included in everything that happens, & he seems to grasp that fact of life better than your wife does.", "NTA it was a date. (I know it's a bit of a weird word to use for 11 year olds but I guess it's an 11 year olds version of that) and you don't take your siblings along to those...", "NTA and I'm glad to see a dad stand up for his little girl, your wife is enabling a little entitled monster if she keeps this up", "NTA. Taking your son to your daughter's outing would have been playing favorites, not the other way around.", "Nta. Just to get the verdict out of the way first.\n\nDude, your wife seriously has the most warped logic I have ever heard. Your daughter is invited to watch a movie with a guy. What's the brother got to tag along for? To be a street lamp on the side? You literally just told her you are open to the idea of taking your son alone to watch Avatar some time down the line and her response is that 'That's not the point?'.\n\nUh - except it is the point. Her argument of you playing favorites is predicated on the absence of your son attending a movie date that doesn't warrant his presence (which, for some reason, she thinks it does because inclusivity? Idk). So going by her argument, you can bring your son, alone, to the movies where the daughter's presence is not warranted and all of a sudden, you will be 'playing favorites' with your son. See? Cancels the favoritism out. According to her argument. \n\nWhere's the problem?", "NTA\n\nYour wife could have gotten off her ass and taken your son to another theater or to an earlier/later showing.  The easiest fix in the world was in her grasp, but she'd rather yell at you for this and, more importantly, deny your son a trip to see Avatar.", "NTA. Parents who think kids should always do exactly the same things all the time drive me bonkers. As kids grow up they have different interests and identities, and always forcing them to do things together only leads to resentment. You offered to take your son another time, so you were definitely not playing favorites.", "Nta\n\nIm glad you stood up for your daughter, your wife sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. He wasn't invited, simple as that. Besides, you said that you could take him another time, so I don't see the problem.", "NTA - this was the right thing to do. Also if your son wanted to see it so badly why is your wife waiting until your daughter was asked to see it? Why not take him on his own at any point in the last few weeks if shes that concerned.", "NTA. Your daughter was on a date. Siblings need the chance to be individuals.

You weren't playing favorites, you were merely not forcibly inserting your son into a social situation to which he was not invited.", "NTA.\n\n1. It wasn't an outing between friends, it was a date. A date with chaperones, but still. Where did the little brother fit in all that?\n2. You offered to bring the brother to the cinema at a later time. It was a good compromise. \n3. The brother does not have to be everywhere his sister is. She can have her life, friends, activities, etc. of her own.\n4. One does not bring uninvited parties to an event for the sake of \"fairness\". It's rude. \n5. She could have gone to the movies with her son, separately. There was no need to force you to force the brother to partake in the date.", "NTA you did the right thing. It sucks not being invited but that's life! Your wife can take him to the movie.", "NTA, it's your daughters date.  Take the boy on his own.", "Nta", "NTA. You didn't decide out of the blue (sorry, couldn't resist) to treat your daughter to a movie.  You decided to chaperone a movie to which your daughter had been invited.

You're a good dad for sticking up for your kid.", "NTA.  You handled this 100% correctly IMO.  Your son is not going to crash by  being told 'not today but soon'.  Your wife needs to understand both kids are not ONE child.  Both are individuals.  Bravo to you, OP.", "Absolutely NTA. Your daughter was asked out on a date! And you wife really expected her younger brother to tag along. You were definitely correct in not taking him. He sold enough to understand that\u2019s he\u2019s can\u2019t alway tag along. It would be better to take him for some father/son time anyway to go see the movie. Your wife\u2019s being ridiculous and it sounds like your son is her golden child and she\u2019s the one playing favorites here!", "NTA. You don't bring your brother on a date.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t about not living your son, it\u2019s about respecting your daughters boundaries and you did a great job. Wife is going to need to learn that both kids are going to do their own activities and playdates and not everything your daughter does is a joint event.

Did your wife get left out of things a lot as a child? She seems to be projecting? \n\nHonest question- why couldn\u2019t the other parent take Mark and sit in a different area of the theatre. So not interfering with his sisters date, but still able to go and enjoy the movie?\n\nMy judgement come from the idea that Emily and Mark will want to do things solo and the other does have to understand this.", "NTA, but now turn around and take your son to see the movie. I mean the same day or no later then the next day.", "NTA.\n\nI'm confused by your wife's logic.  Where does the line end?  Your daughter goes on dates, has to take her brother.  Your daughter gets engaged, better include her brother!  Getting married now, must include her brother!!\n\nThis isn't favoritism, it's... normal behavior?\n\nMaybe she wanted a day alone, maybe she doesn't want to admit that her daughter is growing up and going on cute dates.  Either way, she needs to understand that she's making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\nOut of curiosity, if your son was invited out by a friend or wanted to invite someone out, would he have to include his sister?", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And with the way your wife was really wanting y'all to take your son along, it sounds like she might be struggling and need some time to herself.

Maybe ask her what upset her so much about this situation in particular, and, perhaps, to replay it with the friend being a girl and see if she would have reacted the same way. \n\nIf your wife can see a doctor and consider bioidentical HRT, that will probably make the next few years easier around your place - a daughter going through puberty and a mother going through menopause is a rough mix even in the most well-adjusted families.", "NTA\n\nIt was nice for you to take your daughter to see her friend for a movie and your right your son don't need to go where he wasn't invited.

OP is right with this and is setting up healthy boundries for the kids.\n\nSounds like something is really bugging OP's wife and this probably isn't the root problem.  Sounds like OP is taking the right steps and is planning on speaking with his wife about it.", "Maybe the wife was, hoping for a night home alone?", "[removed]", "I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but OP sounds like a pretty involved dad. Based on the dynamics described in the post, if she wanted a night to herself, she could have just asked OP to take both kids to the movies another night and he would have. I don\u2019t see any reason to make up an elaborate backstory for a very simple request.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that the mom was pretending VERY HARD that her daughter was not, absolutely not, no way in hell asked on her first date (and also in pretty deep denial about it.) Little brothers are the ultimate romance destroyers.", "was wondering if i was the only one questioning why mom & son didn't go to another show/theater?? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Honestly this was my first thought. I live in an area without a theatre nearby so I\u2019d never be able to leave a younger sibling at home while I only went to the movies.\n\nNot to mention it becomes more expensive because now they need to pay for a parents ticket twice.\n\nI\u2019m probably projecting, but I agree that a little more I N F O is needed for the logistics.", "Honestly, I suspect this is what your wife doesn't like. If her brother goes along, then it's taking out \"the kids\", but when it's just her on a date with a boy, that means she's growing up.\n\nETA that is really disgusting and manipulative that your wife said you don't love your son just to get her way. I'd be thoroughly pissed about this in your place", "You're a good dad. You made your girl first Dating exp great, and this will help her in adult life.

Taking her brother makes it a family outing instead of a date, which probably feels more comfortable. Having that first kid transition into dating can be a big adjustment and mom likely thought they weren't quite at that point. 11 is younger than most people think about their kids' dating, at least in my experience, so this might have felt really sudden. My guess is that she just was caught off guard by the need to shift into this next phase of parenthood and reacted poorly. She made the wrong call, but I kinda get it.", "[deleted]", "Yep.

If as you mentioned this is not normal behavior for your wife, I bet you any money her daughter being asked on her first date was a trigger. My mom started acting funny around this time too. \n\nIt could be hitting her that her kid is growing up, or even more likely that she is becoming anxious that her daughter will have to start realizing soon that not all boys are nice, safety precautions must be followed, etc etc. In short, I think moms get anxious when girls grow up because they know how scary it is to be a teenager girl!", "NTA great work Dadding.", "NTA. Honestly your wife was out of line even suggesting you take your son out to your daughter's date. I'm sure your daughter must really appreciate that you stood up for her.  \n\nAlso you should consider taking your son out before he prompts you to. You do now owe him a movie and maybe you can take him to a dinner or something too to get some bonding time.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t playing favourites, you are establishing very reasonable boundaries for your son.

Your children should be their own people with their own friends and hobbys, not slumped together because SiblingsTM, it doesn't help them bond, it just makes one of them start resenting the other", "Absolutely NTA. I think you handled this perfectly. Mark wont be coming on Emily\u2019s dates (unless she specifically asks for him to) and that\u2019s okay. Crush or friendship, this boy asked her because he wanted to spend time juat with her, not her and her baby brother, who undoubtedly would have been trying to get at least some of this fellow boy\u2019s attention with boy-centric things. \n\nI am not sure what\u2019s going on with your wife, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re in open discussions. Good luck!", "NTA -  What the heck is she thinking??? It's your daughters first date. A DATE! You don't haul a random sibling along on a date when someone else invites you, that is rude and inappropriate.\n\nIf she is so concerned for the younger child, she could have offered that you chaperone and she take the child by herself (different theater or different timing, so not to crash the date).", "Nta.  You just chaperoned a little adolescent date dude.", "NTA.

Sounds like a date\u2014whether as friends or as crushes doesn\u2019t matter. Sounds like despite your wife\u2019s misstep, that you have a very health relationship with each other and the kids. I like the idea of talking things out with your wife. Maybe she\u2019s going through something internally. Even people without crazy stressors can get unexpectedly hit with depression or anxiety. Plus if she is premenopausal, even more at risk. But be careful\u2014both you and your wife want to avoid blaming every dispute on hormones. My dad was given the worst death stare I\u2019ve ever seen from my mom when he tried that one lol. To me, this almost sounds like two parents who need to revisit their rules, etc. And discuss how things might change as they enter a new stage in life. Both of your kids are very close in age\u2026and about to go through puberty if not already. This is going to be a whole new world you two will have to navigate together as parents. One thing that can also help is to talk to each child about puberty and normal changes with that (if you haven\u2019t already). If you stress about that conversation, then ask their pediatrician for help!", "NTA. Honestly, this is no different than if one kid was invited to a classmate's birthday party. You *DON'T* force the host to allow a child who is a different age and NOT a friend of their child to attend.\n\nThis was a \"date\" and he can't tag along. If your wife wanted to, she could have taken him to see the movie (a different theatre or a different showing though).", "NTA\n\nI have 4 theories on your wife:\n\n1. She just wanted both kids out of the house\n2. She didn't want her little girl going on a date, so she wanted add a 5th wheel\n3. She wanted Mark to get this movie scratched off the list without her having to plan another trip\n4. She just didn't like hearing no.", "NTA, Sounds like your wife might be having issues with her little girl growing up.", "Nta. The kids have separate friends and you can't force them to always hang out with their sibling.", "NTA, but as your edits strongly suggest, I do think that your wife has some feelings about the whole situation that she needs to get off her chest.  I don't know if she's anxious about 'losing' Emily to the freewheeling, independence-seeking teenage years she's about to enter, or maybe she isn't ready for Emily to be hanging out with boys 1-on-1 outside of school.  Perhaps Mark has been feeling left out in other ways that your wife has picked up on but you haven't.  Maybe your wife really is feeling like menopause is on her front step, or anxiety about is making her feel as if she needs to put her foot down and be in control of SOMEthing.  Maybe, it's as simple as the idea that she just really did want that time to herself once she saw the opportunity to have it.\n\nIf there is an AH in this situation, it's unfortunately your wife, but I think it's coming from a deeper place that needs some communication to shed light on it.", "NTA.  Explain in simple terms, this was a date, not a family outing.  Your daughter asked for a chaperone.  It would have been highly inappropriate for her son to go.  You don't bring your siblings on a first date or any date for that matter!  Good Lord!", "NTA. It would be insanity rude for her to show up with her brother I mean no one likes inviting the kid who\u2019s parents make them bring their little siblings", "NTA", "She is afraid of her daughter growing up and going on \"dates\". She wanted her son there to kill the \"date\" vibe (doesn't feel right calling it a cock-block when they're 10 and 11 but you get the drift). That's why this time is different. But she needs to learn to use her words and not just throw temper tantrums about it. Either way you handled it very well, and thank you for standing up for your daughter. The next few years are going to be extremely difficult (I too went thru puberty the same time my mom went thru menopause and it was just the two of us, no buffer like you to keep the sanity) so you should probably try to get on the same page ASAP. Good luck, sincerely!", "NTA, and after reading your edits -- it could also be that she's freaked out by the thought of her daughter starting to date/get interested in boys/grow up. If the brother tags along it can't be a date, but if not...", "So, reading your edits, it occurred to me that your wife may be having issues with accepting...not just her own age, but that her daughter is growing up? The kids having a crush on each other (it might just be a friendship as you note, but a crush is also a possibility) might be bringing home to her that her kid is entering the age where romantic, sexual relationships are no longer things to be in the future. It might not be an articulated thought in her mind, just something she's reacting to subconsciously. And a way of negating that is to have your son go. If he's there, it's a kids are just hangin' scenario. If it's them (despite the parental presence) it's a boy and a girl (the girl being asked out with a flower, which was super cute and made me go aww, but does indicate a more than friendship interest). \n\nIf she's usually not like this, favoring your son, being so pushy with your daughter then it might be worth digging into. It's not uncommon to have this reaction, but exploring it in early states wiould probably help with ensuring that it never turns toxic as far as your kids are concerned. It's fine to have weird feelings about these things--it's not okay to manifest it in unfair behavior. \n\nNTA", "INFO - I don't understand why you couldn't take your son and he sits next to you? Would that have made any difference to your daughter?", "Based on the edits, it sounds like OP's wife has an issue with her daughter going on a \"date\" and wanted her brother there, additionally, to supervise, or something.
