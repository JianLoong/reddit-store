If the medicine you bought didn't work, what would your stepson do then?  Would he even be able to distinguish between the medicine not working yet, versus not working, versus causing an adverse effect?  \n\nIt may help to have a communication notebook that gets passed back and forth between household with your stepson, where any parent or stepparent can record and communicate any issues to the other parents and stepparents.
