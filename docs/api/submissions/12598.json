The deodorant wasn't working out, step-dad gave him something else to try.  Maybe Step-Dad did something critical of Dad at the time, like snorted and said \"Deodorant?  That's dumb.\" Maybe the child just made it seem that way.

By the time he starts to stink, the habit will be ingrained.", "Some kids have smelly armpits by 10. It is also possible he's only using deodorant to emulate his dad or because his dad told him to. That seems more likely since he also put it on his groin and under his feet.\n\nAlso, you definitely don't need to get a doctor's opinion to use cortisone cream. You only need to consult a doctor if you have an allergic reaction or the condition doesn't improve within a few days.\n\nAs long as the kid doesn't use it for weeks and is careful about where he applies it, it should be completely safe.

The maximum strength you can get without a prescription is 1%, at least in my state, and most people use 0.05% or 0.10%.

This is a medical issue, it doesn't matter whether the kid would be \"embarrassed\", mom needs to know. For her own knowledge of her child, and to tell bio dad.

Cuz all it takes is one person to misconstrue your intentions.", "You just need to stop. You are clearly clueless.

But puberty before the age of 8 for girls and 9 for boys is a medical condition (precocious puberty), can be caused by many serious diseases (ofc some are just genetic or familial).\n\nThe smell of sweat that any person will have after a work out is vastly different than the armpit stink of an adult.

Now if dad wanted you to not help the kid at all until he is notified, then he would have been the ah - but this is not what I get from your story.\n\nAlso, the kid should have had a shower to remove the allergen from his skin; THEN use the cortisone, if still necessary. But this doesn't count in the verdict; in fact you sound like a good step-dad. Just not very good at collaborating with the other parent.", "NTA, kid's dad gave him awful life advice that led to athlete's crotch. Good on you to help a mini-bro out.", "NTA.  I'm a female and, while I wouldn't have inspected the area, I would have asked questions about the rash and provided the cortisone.  That is one area you don't want to have itching, I don't care what gender you are.  I also think you were right to tell your stepson to discuss it with his dad.  That way, you didn't betray his trust.  Plus, he's getting to that age where kids kind of start wanting to handle things for themselves.  This gives him a chance to learn how to have delicate conversations without too much embarrassment.", "NTA. The kid chose you to speak to.", "NTA.

Is that a thing guys do??????? \n\nYou gave him the lotion, it's not like you applied it yourself.", "NTA. I\u2019m absolutely sure your stepson appreciated the help relieving his itchy pain. And he very clearly trusts you if he came to you with this problem, I\u2019m sure his dad would\u2019ve just told you to give him some anti-itch cream anyways. Dude was suffering and asked you for help, and you did just that. I don\u2019t see a problem. And if your stepson wants/needs deodorant for any smelly areas that normal deodorant doesn\u2019t cut it for, I would recommend Lume. They make a version that comes in a lotion form that helps tremendously with smells anywhere on the body. Lasts quite a while from what I\u2019ve heard. Hopefully it won\u2019t irritate his skin too, but worth a shot? Maybe tell his dad that you were only trying to help and your stepson wanted to talk to his dad about it himself in person?", "Absolutely! And should be so glad his son feels safe and comfortable enough to have a mature and honest discussion like this with someone in his home! It\u2019s not like dad is there 100% of the time and it\u2019s great that a young person at an age where all sorts of crazy starts going on with your body has a back up person that they are happy to talk to! It should be a big relief to him rather than an issue.", "My only problem is that from the story it doesn't appear like the dad wanted to make the call, just that he wanted to be warned there was something wrong with his son.", "Yes, I wondered about that too! Wouldn't that be horrendously irritating? My husband taught our son to use Gold Bond medicated powder around his crotch if he got itchy from sweating.

The amount of shame about puberty instead of just arming people with the necessary info to tackle a body on mayhem haywire mode for a while gets me a bit grouchy.\n\nI still try to loom, but now everyone is taller than me T_T\nFor a few magical years, I was a giant amongst mortals.", "Unfortunately, yes", "We had that as our health module in 4th-6th grade in the 70s but without parents", "I never considered neosporin a medication but I guess others do", "Just because we can get something over the counter doesn't mean it isn't considered a medication.
