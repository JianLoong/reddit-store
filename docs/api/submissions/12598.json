Also to correct the problem otherwise next week the kids has rush all over cause he continue to spay himself away. This could be even relate to something smaller \u2018ehi don\u2019t use that brand of body wash I saw redness after bath time\u2019, adults do not comuniate between each other, specially in extended families. Kids are not reliable. Not their fault just still too young.", "NTA. A kudos to you for being a parent and kudos to your stepson for being comfortable enough to talk to you about it. Definitely an awkward situation but you handled it very well and helped him. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "You shouldn't give a kid cortisone without consultation with a parent first.", "Cortisone is general first aid here, I thought this required a doctors visit and an Rx", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA \nYour step son was uncomfortable. You took care of it. He should not have to wait for his mom or dad before he gets some help. You did the right thing.", "NTA- you helped the kid.", "NTA at all.... he trusted you to share, his dad needed to respect that and be thankful you helped.", "That's what I was wondering too.  I could understand some men doing that in hot weather while working outside, but to tell a 10 year old to do it???  No way that's gonna turn out well.  Plus I really hope stepdad had the kid wash his junk before using the cream.  Either way, stepdad is NTA!", "I was using deodorant (not antiperspirant, hippy mum that I'm now grateful for) aged 10 because I needed it. Puberty can start at 9, or at 16.", "I think Dad was upset that Step-Dad basically said his advice (deodorant) was wrong, and Step-Dad's advice (cortisone) was correct.\n\nWhich is petty and silly.  The deodorant wasn't working out, step-dad gave him something else to try.  Maybe Step-Dad did something critical of Dad at the time, like snorted and said \"Deodorant?  That's dumb.\" Maybe the child just made it seem that way.  Or maybe Dad just can't handle any perceived slight of his superior judgement on all matters.\n\nThe question of AH is more a matter of tone and attitude.  Based on OP's version of the story, NTA.", "No. I gave my son some at nine. Why? Because the sooner he develops the habit of putting it on the better. By the time he starts to stink, the habit will be ingrained.", "Some kids have smelly armpits by 10. It is also possible he's only using deodorant to emulate his dad or because his dad told him to. That seems more likely since he also put it on his groin and under his feet.\n\nAlso, you definitely don't need to get a doctor's opinion to use cortisone cream. You only need to consult a doctor if you have an allergic reaction or the condition doesn't improve within a few days.\n\nAs long as the kid doesn't use it for weeks and is careful about where he applies it, it should be completely safe. Most side effects only occur after weeks or months of continuous use.", "Cortizone cream is not medication btw. It's an over-the-counter ointment that can be used for ezcema, bug bites, etc. It's basically like a soothing lotion.", "No 10 is definitely not too young", "Why does bio dad sound like a dick?", "and? Its nothinng compared to \"traditional\" steriods and is probably over the counter - meaning it is the lowest concentration they have", "A STEROID, is any member of a class of natural or synthetic organic compounds characterized by a molecular structure of 17 carbon atoms arranged in four rings. \n\nIf you don't know what a word means, don't try to use it to imply something bad...", "Are you sure you can't get the 0.5% stuff over the counter?", "I'm assuming OP is in the U.S., and you aren't.  Here in the U.S., the over-the-counter cortisone creams we can get are nowhere near the strength you think they are.  The maximum strength you can get without a prescription is 1%, at least in my state, and most people use 0.05% or 0.10%.  And it's not like it's slathered on - you only need to use a very small amount, like the size of a pea.", "I\u2019m also shocked by the women who use baby powder. Is it because they\u2019re sweaty? Or is it for chafing? Idk.", "I was one of those second graders. My apologies to my classmates. I also got acne by 4th grade and my period by age 10.", "Perfect analysis! \nI totally agree.", "It\u2019s medication. The weakest strength (0.5% where I live) is OTC. But it\u2019s still medication. Just like aspirin and Tylenol and lots of other OTC medications. Doesn\u2019t mean it was inadvisable to use it. But it\u2019s a medication.", "Why can step dad not talk to bio dad? Seems a bit silly. Grown adults who are parenting the same kids should all have open communication.", "This is what I'm missing from the top comments. This is a medical issue, it doesn't matter whether the kid would be \"embarrassed\", mom needs to know. For her own knowledge of her child, and to tell bio dad. FYI, teaching kids to keep secrets from their parents is something they now teach as a sign of child s*xual abuse, so for your own sake (not saying you're a creep, just saying from an outside perspective) don't encourage secrets between you and him that his bio parents don't know about. Cuz all it takes is one person to misconstrue your intentions.", "You just need to stop. You are clearly clueless. My kids bathe daily and wear clean clothes and have worn deodorant since 7/8 years old as do lots of clean children. Also puberty isn't a medical condition.", "The head of my son\u2019s middle school (5-8) will discretely pass students who need to use it travel deodorant sticks. She warns the parents at orientation. My son started using it starting in 5th because he didn\u2019t want to risk that.", "Please tell me it wasnt the powder fresh scent. That plus teen/pre-teen sweat smells like dirty diapers. And it was the one the school provided when I was in 5th grade. The scent still makes me gag.", "I mean do you think Neosporene is a medication? Or aloe vera?", "Really? I thought puberty is a form of cancer!\nI know it is not a medical condition! But puberty before the age of 8 for girls and 9 for boys is a medical condition (precocious puberty), can be caused by many serious diseases (ofc some are just genetic or familial).\n\nThe smell of sweat that any person will have after a work out is vastly different than the armpit stink of an adult. I love how people read my comment in every possible wrong way. One person said she knew a kid whose feet stinks! When was that even remotely related to deodorant.\n\nAnyways, if your kids need deodorant put it on them! \nThis whole debate went sideways for too long.", "Last year I taught 3rd grade, and by the end of the school year things started to reek. I had to gently suggest the use of deodorant (in general, without singling out anyone).", "Neosporin is an antibiotic ointment.  Do you honestly think antibiotics aren't medication?", "Why wouldn't they be?", "Nah you just called out for your ignorance and you're still acting like you know something. Like I said you just need to stop.", "Yeah baby powder isn\u2019t great."]}
