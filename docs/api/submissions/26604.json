My parents had me young and my brother when they were older. My dad is having health issues due to the many years of abusing pills. He was in the hospital for two week for kidney failure and is definitely not 100%. \n\nI come by a lot more to literally make sure he's alive and not dead. Andreas is very used to being the center of our dad's attention and has been acting out because our dad is sick. \n\nYesterday I was cleaning up my dad's room when he asked Andreas to please make him soup and to take a shower. My brother said go make it yourself and he doesn't care about needing a shower. I asked my dad if he was going to let him talk to him that way and he said it's fine. I said it wasn't.\n\nI told Andreas not to talk to our dad that way and go be helpful by making him soup. He said I don't live there so he doesn't have to listen to me. I said actually you do because I'll take your Switch away. I'm your older brother and you will listen to me. \n\nHe didn't say anything for a minute and he just said no. So I took his Switch away and he started to cry. He tried to take it back and I said you're not getting it until you make our dad soup and take a shower and if you talk back then I will take your Switch home with me.\n\nMy dad told me he couldn't stand the fighting and to just it back and I'm the brother not the parent. I said I'm not letting him disrespect me. My brother got my dad his soup and took a shower and locked himself in his room until I left.\n\nI don't feel sorry for Andreas. It's because of me that he has clean clothes, gets to where he needs to be at, has food, etc.", "created_utc": 1694358984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f2snq/aita_for_disciplining_my_younger_brother/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If/When his dad dies, he'll be going through a lot and will need to have those boundaries reinforced by *someone.* That's just as important as emotional support with a young child in his position.\n\nIn your dad's condition, every little thing can be exhausting.

If there are no other adults in your lives to step up and help out then social services should be called to arrange nursing care or a personal support worker. Most hospitals in any civilized country have social workers to help with such things in the case of a seriously ill single parent going home to a young child.\n\nYour father is a massive AH for expecting a 9-year-old child to provide most of his home care, feeding him and tending to him. At that age a child still needs adult supervision and cannot even legally be left to care for themselves, much less be in charge of the care of a helpless adult recovering from a serious hospital stay. And you are an even bigger AH for just popping in and out of their home and thinking you're some big saviour, whilst leaving that child to do the daily care of your dad . . . and then literally PUNISHING an overwhelmed, stressed out, traumatized kid for behaving in an entirely age- and situationally-appropriate manner.

The biggest thing assholery about it seems like the last comment about not having empathy- He's 9 dude.
