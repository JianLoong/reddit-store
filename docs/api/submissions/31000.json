I don't feel like its fair to exclude him, especially since he is clean, following the Dr's orders and is acting pretty much like his old self again. I think it will discourage him and cause him to not want to continue trying. He is really excited to see her and doesn't know how she feels. I told her she would have to tell him herself, because that's between them.\n\nShe says its not fair that she is coming all the way home, paying for a hotel and then not going to be able to spend time with anyone.\n\nEdit: I should have also mentioned my son is living with me and I am getting legal guardianship of him, so I am making sure that he is taking his meds and going to his appointments.

Who knows when the holidays come around he may well be back on the street drugs or not taking his prescription drugs at all or not in the right way. How long do you think it will take you to find out if/when he's gone back to using street drugs? I think it's also common for people with this kind of mental illness to stop taking their prescription drugs because of their undesirable (side) effects when they feel they are doing better, not fully realising that their feeling better is all due to the positive/intended effects of the drugs, not because they 'got better'. They quit taking the drugs because they think they are better and can manage on their own, and they can't, they fall back into their reckless/dangerous behaviours, they end up getting in (serious) trouble, get admitted, get put back on prescription drugs, and the cycle starts again. I hope your son is different but you can't guarantee that. You can't guarantee that he will still be clean on the holidays or that he won't act in an aggressive, dangerous, or scary manner.\n\nIt is totally fair to not want to spend time around someone with such severe mental health issues who chose to use illegal drugs and is only super recently clean and only recently been back on the prescription drugs. She shouldn't have to subject herself to that as she is probably scared for his behaviour. I would be too if I had heard stories of how bad it got. I'd wait for him to be more like 6+ months clean and taking his prescriptions. You don't get to decide when she should feel safe to be around him.\n\nBut it's your house and you get to decide who you invite. If you insist on including your son, then I understand you don't like your daughter's suggestion of basically taking the party you planned elsewhere, but you are inconsiderate to her feelings and fear. But if you are planning to stick to your plan, you need to tell your daughter. Why not suggest doing something with her and a few other close family members that SHE invites on one of the other days of her trip? If she's going through the effort and expenses to travel and get a hotel then you should make time for her in a way that she feels comfortable. Otherwise tell her not to bother coming home and she can choose to not come at all as it will just be a waste of her time and money if you don't want to see her without your mentally ill son.", "NTA sounds like you're trying to be a good father imo", "NAH. \n\nYour daughter is allowed to host an event at the hotel if she so chooses and invite who she wants. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for wanting your son to be a part of things.

But, I also don't think one of my kids gets to ask me to exclude their sibling from anything having to do with my home, my time, or my family.\n\nI'd put this back in my daughter's lap.

You get to say who can be in your home. But at the same time your daughter gets to say who can come to her hotel room.", "NAH\n\nAt a month and a half, people can still be tweaking and have cravings after getting clean. It takes time to truly see if someone has gone sober. Relapses early in sobriety are very common, unfortunately. \n\nIn her eyes he is a drug addict. Its harsh, but he hasn't been clean that long. So her not wanting to be around him makes some sense. \n\nYou're his dad, and no parent wants their kid excluded. \n\nI don't think either one of you has invalid reasoning. It may take time for her brother to earn trust and work his way back into her life.", "NAH. You want to help your son with his recovery and mental health, and that's the right thing to do.\n\n...but I also guarantee your son's done something that's completely got your daughter on edge about being near him. Hopefully, it's only something as minor as stealing a few bucks from her to feed his drug habit... But drugs, psychosis and schizophrenia are a combination that means something really, really, bad could have happened and she has legitimate reason to be afraid of him.\n\nMaybe you should talk to your daughter about exactly why she doesn't want to be around him?", "Not at all, I think excluding him would be wrong and is unfair to put him through given that he already struggles with mental health issues. I think it's worth talking to your daughter and seeing if you explain to her the implications of not inviting him, remind her that that is her brother.", "Your house you don\u2019t have to (not should you exclude) him if you don\u2019t want to\n\nBut that may mean she doesn\u2019t come at all.  Are you prepared for that?  Maybe try and find a compromise-can you go see her a different week or something?", "NTA - Family should support each other, especially during the holidays. Excluding your son could discourage his progress and hinder his mental health. It's important to communicate and find a compromise that works for everyone.", "NTA\n\nAnd well done refusing to meditate between your adult children. This is no longer your job. If your daughter doesn't want to see him, she needs to own it. And, it seems unyielding and unforgiving, though somewhat understandable, to refuse to see someone because of the mental illness and behavior that never directly affected her. It's hard when people use street drugs to treat their mh; you often get the worst of both worlds (dug seeking behavior and poor mh). Your son is lucky to have your support through this.", "Leaning towards YTA. Your daughter has reason to not want to be around her brother. She knows that he has been self medicating and is probably weary and nervous to be around him. She doesn\u2019t have to be present for his harmful behavior to be impacted by it or become scared of him. She is traveling home and paying for a hotel and is basically missing thanksgiving just to avoid seeing him. If she wants to have some gathering in her hotel to have some sort of holiday celebration she should. Especially when they celebration is not interfering in the official family holiday celebrations. \n\nYes it may be hurtful to her brother but she isn\u2019t asking for him to leave his home during thanksgiving. You are only protecting your son and aren\u2019t caring for your daughter at all. She is traveling, paying for a hotel, and making other plans with family.

Bottom line all of this is \"grown folks business\" I've always been told, so you just need to move forward with your plan and tell your daughter this.

If she does and it doesn't go well with your son there's nothing you can do.

Has anything specifically happened between both of them? You also stated that she heard from family members and wasn't around when your son was going through his mental health issues. It seems like something is missing. If not, then your daughter is judgemental and has no right to dictate how things will go if she is coming home to visit. She does have the right to not be around her brother and she needs to be an adult and communicate her issues with him to his face. You are not the middleman. Celebrating early Christmas, playing prize games, and doing gift exchange is a whole event. On top of the fact that everyone but him can attend. Why did she even bother deciding to come home?", "Info: Personally I\u2019m usually against the age & sex being required because I believe it adds nothing but bias. In this scenario though it\u2019s needed. Who is every one? Are they adults?\n\nEven without that though, I don\u2019t believe this is just over what you say it is.

Yes, he's been sober for a month and a half, but he's just beginning the recovery process. He's taking medication for his schizophrenia now, but that's a very recent change as well. It's common for relapses to happen, especially when the underlying reason for the addiction remains unresolved. Reconnecting with family after an addiction is hard, because in many cases, they've seen the cycle multiple times before. Sobriety, promises, relapse, repeat. There comes a point where most people have to take a step back and see if the loved one actually remains sober for a period of time before jumping into reconciliation again. In his case, it's twofold - is he actually staying sober AND is he taking his medication? Trust has to be earned, and that takes time. That's something that should have already been discussed with him and should continue to be discussed throughout his recovery process. Some relationships can recover, some can't, some relationships get rebuilt but are never the same.

Maybe not the whole Christmas party, but something. If they don\u2019t the daughter could feel like OP is choosing the son over the daughter. That breeds resentment really quick.
