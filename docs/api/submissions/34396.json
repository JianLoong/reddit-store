There was a backpack taking up the last spot that would fit my carry-on suitcase. There was a small spot in the very adjacent compartment that fit the backpack perfectly (a spot literally right next to it, I would never move a bag farther than that). I asked around whose backpack it was so I could move it. No response. I asked the flight attendant if the backpack could be moved and pointed to the adjacent free spot. He just stared at me, no response.\n\nPeople are waiting behind me, compartments are full, flight attendant hasn\u2019t helped. I got desperate and had to move the backpack myself. I shifted it over to the free space right next to where it was. It fit perfectly in the empty space. The owner then stood up and got mad at me for moving it. He has been in the seat right across the aisle, most likely (from my POV) would\u2019ve heard me and seen my struggle finding a spot. I tried to explain that it was taking up literally the only spot big enough for my carry-on. The flight attendant joined in and scolded me, telling me I can\u2019t touch other bags. I know that but I literally asked for help??\n\nI feel there\u2019s only so much I can do when no one claims a bag when I ask and flight attendants aren\u2019t helping.

Tricky to explain but I'm a FA and while we're lowkey boycotting the whole unpaid during boarding thing (likely why you [edit: interpreted*] \"you're on your own\"), we _do_ encourage moving backpacks around (in most cases, shoving it to the side) if we know it needs to be moved. _In saying,_ the FA you dealt with clearly wasn't any help, especially considering they scolded you afterwards. We technically are supposed to aid in the boarding process because we need to keep with On-Time Performance (OTP), avoiding future delays and issues. Nobody responded to the backpack question and you saw a good opportunity to move it around. It should have been under the seat in any case.\n\nI do the on-board announcements and I make it EXCEPTIONALLY clear to my passengers that smaller bags need to be under the seat, regardless of room. Most don't listen and learn the hard way. If the announcement was made during the boarding process, NTA. If the announcement wasn't made, people will subjectively think YTA with no clue in what's happening.\n\nYour FA is TA though.

You asked, got no response, you were fine.\n\nThe flight attendant is an AH - they should have helped move it and clarified the policy/courtesy of shared spaces.\n\nOne thing though - a backpack has just as much right to be in the overhead as a suitcase - plenty of backpacks won't fit under the seats, or someone might have a small bag already taking up the under seat space and place the larger bag overhead, even if it isn't full-size.", "NTA for moving the backpack over a few feet after asking for an owner and not getting a response.\n\nYou just got unlucky with who owned it and the cabin crew (usually the attendants are sliding things around during boarding to make room)\n\nYout attitude about how backpacks shouldn't be up there at all I take issue with.

Why are people so touchy and so selfish? It's not like OP is chucking the backpack across the plane or slinging it out the door, they're literally moving it a few inches. If the backpack owner didn't want anyone touching their luggage, why didn't they speak up when OP asked and just stand up and move it the couple of inches themselves?", "Personally I think all suitcases should be in the hold and only small day-sacks/handbags allowed in the cabin. No one ever needs to go into these suitcases. Also the damage they do if the lockers pop open and they come out is horrendous. But NTA in this instance as you gave people the opportunity. Usually stewards ask people to put rucksacks under the seat. Which I also disagree with - stretching, DVT, and emergency access/egress but them are the rules we fly by.", "ESH.

I have been in this situation and you are so stressed holding up the line. You have to do *something* to keep it moving. I was recently on a flight that had the 2/1 seat configuration at the front of the plane & I had the 1 seat side in the 1st 5 rows. I was in the 1st boarding group but  *ALL* the bins in my area were full even though only one person was sitting in my section (people in the back before me threw their bags in) I had my laptop bag & a small hard-shell carry on. the bin above my seat had ONE suit jacket in it & I was looking frantically for a FA to ask if I could check my bag as the bins were full. No response & I knew I was blocking the aisle , I was standing there blocking everything so I just plopped by carry-on in my seat & stood in front of the seat so people could pass while trying to get an FA's attention so I didn't hold up boarding. Finally the one guy in the section looks over & asks \"do you need me to move my coat?\" and proceeded to take 5 minutes taking it out & folding it up blocking the aisle yet again. I don't think I was unreasonable AH expecting the bin below a one-seat aisle (and being in the 1st group to board)  would be accessible.", "NTA.

Small roller bags are literally often called carry ons because they fit the overhead compartment.  There\u2019s no reason for someone *not* to bring a roller suitcase on board.

It\u2019s my pet peeve that you think I should put my bag under my seat just because you want to carry a larger bag.    I appreciate the real issue is the airline not restricting the sizes more.

You might be putting it behind a person so they have to wait to disembark or they may be asleep/in a different part of the plane and panic when they can't find it later.\n\nI think it was fair of you to ask the flight attendant and the people seated around the bins, but you shouldn't have taken matters into your own hands. Unfortunately, If you're a later boarder with a large carry on, you're not guaranteed to find open space above your seat (or at all in the plane) and you should plan for that.

You are not entitled to the overhead space closest to you if you are flying economy. It would probably be nice, but it\u2019s not how it works. You should have carried on walking and checked for spots in the overheads further down. Then if need be checked the other aisle. If you still found nothing available then stand at the back of the plane and wait for everyone to be seated. Then you can tell the FA you can\u2019t find a spot. All else fails, they will check your bag for you free of charge.
