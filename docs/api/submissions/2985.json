A few things.  First, that whole express line isn't written in stone just because there is a lighted sign.  If the store is busy, ANYONE can go to the express line regardless if they have over 15 items.  The cashier can call someone over from a regular line if there is no one in the express lane as well.  How busy was the store?  Did the cashier call him over from a regular line?  Second, even if they take up time, you have to be aware that stores offer coupons and people use them.  How is it this guys fault, or some little old lady's fault or anyone else's fault for taking advantage of something that EVERYONE can take part in.  Just because you don't doesn't make anyone who does any less or more deserving of common decency.  Finally, it's obvious that the cashier was the one to blame because she did ring him up wrong if there was a difference from the first time.  Why are you giving this dude any shit at all?!?!?  HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO MAKE THE CASHIER DOUBLE CHECK!!!  It's not your money so who are you to say anything about $8.  How do you know what their budget is or what they are going through that might make that amount matter.  There is no excuse here for your behavior.

I always hated the practice.", "Does your grocery store not have self-check out? I mean if I got behind someone in the express lane with a huge cart of groceries then I would just know that there would be issues of some kind (coupons, incorrect price scanning, digging for that extra penny).

How is this not the managers fault?  Do you do EVERYTHING that a sign tells you to do?  i.e. speed limit sign?", "OP got in line when the gentleman was already there.  Could the cashier have called him over from a different line because there was no line at her register?  Also, the manager said \"don't refuse customers who have over 15 items\".  What if the gentleman was a regular and knew this and took advantage of the manager's dumbassery?  If the manager isn't going to enforce it, why have it?  How is this the gentleman's fault?  OP could have been a better person.", "Actually, yes: whether the guy in front of OP is the asshole is by definition included in the question here, that\u2019s how this sub works.

You could be hauling 5 carts full of groceries and go to the 15 items or less registers, the cashiers couldn't do a damned thing about it.\n\nAfter spending 12 hrs butchering meat, the last thing I want to do is stand in line for 20 minutes for two items.", "NTA.  NTA.  NTA.  And also, THANK YOU for doing this.  As we see from this sub, there are WAYYYY too many As in the world, and you just helped reduce that number.

Too long to type out, but it involved buying a microwave at lowes that ended up taking an hour and a half, poorly trained staff (not their fault), being told to go out in the PARKING LOT and order it on-line, having that canceled, being ignored and FINALLY leaving with it.

Bad choices were made on both parts. The world needs more patience and compassion. Yeah you REALLY WANTED to go home, but if you\u2019re just going home then you had 10 minutes to spare for someone who doesn\u2019t move as quickly and easily as you do. Someday the roles will be reversed. Hopefully that person will have patience and compassion for you", "Plus a massive hypocrite. If he had the patience he was advocating, he would have gone to the regular line.", "My worst experience, I was behind an extreme couponer with a two- layer fishing tackle box.  I still have nightmares, lol.", "Then write a check.  Ugh...", "Seems like either the guy or the cashier would have mentioned it if he was pulled out of the proper line.", "And don\u2019t even start filling out the check while items are being scanned\u2026", "Maybe, but that comes down to the person.  Some would argue that it's no one's business and others would argue that if effects everyone else in line.", "Seriously, if you've got two items versus my twenty, I don't mind waiting an extra minute or two so you can get out with the few items you've got. I've seen people flip out over someone politely asking if they could do so, and I just can't comprehend how stuck up your own ass you have to be to get offended over something so trivial.", "Found the guy\nNTA Op", "Because adults should be capable of self regulation and going with community expectations, ie following a sign.\n\nThat's why the old guys an ass hat.  Because the reason the manager doesn't enforce it is because pricks like him won't remove themselves even when confronted and it's not illegal so what are they actually going to do.\n\nDoes following signs hurt you somehow?  I bet you wipe your ass, look at the \"please wash hands\" sign and say \"I ain't no sheep\"", "No, no it's not.  The question from OP is her wondering if she was the asshole for how she acted.  Yes, yes she is because there is no reason to act like a petulant child when you're 24.  Also, OP didn't know the whole story.  Would the guy still be the asshole if the cashier had called him over from another line because hers(the express line) was empty?  Would he still be the asshole if he KNEW that the manager doesn't enforce the \"sign\" that says Express Line?  How come the manager isn't the asshole?", "Yes, it is. Try reading the rules of the sub.", "So he's the asshole just because he was in front of OP?"]}
