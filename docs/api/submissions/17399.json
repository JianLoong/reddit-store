He had been the one holding our family up working overtime just to keep us afloat. My mom hadn't had a job for over a year at that point, and never bothered to try looking for one. When he passed I was the only one working. I won't say where I worked, as I'm still there, but it was and still isn't nearly as profitable as my dad's job was.\n\nWe ended up moving, receiving the life insurance money not long after. At this point I had already spent most of my savings helping us move and pay the last couple months of rent and groceries we needed to survive. Of all this money I spent trying to help, I was told I would get every penny back. I've received maybe $100 so far. I was 18 at this point and a lot of pressure had been put on me to basically fill my dad's role as caretaker for a while. Something, I felt, I shouldn't have to do at that age, or even now for that matter. \n\nThroughout the past year and a half she's been terrified of any expense that wasn't absolutely essential. Tires for her car went onto my credit card (at this point I didn't have Mt own car so she was my transportation). A security system for our house, almost $400 of expense which still hasnt been set up, fell on me as well. Life continues like this for a while.\n\nThe insurance money lasted us a while, up until very recently. She waited until after our rent was due to tell me she didn't have any money and needed help with rent. At this point I have just purchased my first car and am paying our phone, internet, and my car, as well as the past few months of utilities. I was able to pitch in $300 towards rent but the rest had to go elsewhere.\n\nI told my few closest friends what was going on as well as my job. I was approved for overtime at work but even with that I would still most likely have to work a second job to get my family through. My friends have finally had it with how I've been forced into the role of caretaker and one of them spoke with their landlord about the potential of letting me rent a room like he is. I was given an offer of $400 a month. I'm ready to move through with it. Mom doesn't know anything yet.\n\nAt this point in time after keeping track of everything I've been promised I would be paid back for, I'm owed $10,421.29.\n\nSo, my question is, am I the asshole for leaving them behind to start on my own because I can no longer afford to live with them?", "created_utc": 1684253465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j9imk/aita_for_moving_out_when_my_mother_57_isnt/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your mother is doing is putting you into the space your father filled which is unfair to all of you. She is going to have to put her big girl pants on and start being the adult she is supposed to be.", "It sounds like your mom isn\u2019t going to change until she has to. She could have used the life insurance to build up to self sufficiency , but hasn\u2019t. \n\nSit down with her, and your brothers. ( why isn\u2019t the 19 yr old helping?!) Tell her you are leaving  out of funds and she has to start supporting herself and the household.  \n\nStop giving her your credit card or bank info. Change accounts if you have to.  Add up every thing you have given over the last few years and tell them this can\u2019t continue \n\nI don\u2019t know if there are any social services in your area but they might be able to help. NTA", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility to take on at such a young age.\n\nYour mother is supposed to be the parent and is responsible for finding a job and financially taking care of your brothers. If she can\u2019t do that, she should be on welfare. Your 19-year-old brother is also old enough to start working and contributing to the household, or at least start paying for his share of expenses. What is he doing? The biggest concern here is your 16-year-old brother as he\u2019s a minor, but thankfully he only has a couple years to go until finishing high school and being able to work full time as well. That will at least ensure both of them have some means of taking care of themselves and not have to depend on your mother. Your mother sounds untrustworthy in regards to money. \n\nI highly recommend taking this new apartment and focusing first and foremost on supporting yourself. One financially stable and independent member is far more beneficial for the family than all members drowning to support each other. Maybe invite your brothers over for weekly meals (to make sure they\u2019re being fed) and moral support, and give or loan them some money when you can, especially for bare necessities and investments (eg. school) that will help them build their own lives in the future? They, not your mom, will be responsible for eventually paying you back what you lend them directly.", "NTA\n\nPlease break the news about moving out to them gently.\n\nINFO\n\nWhat are your mother's and brothers' excuses for not working?

Your mother and the 19 year old can get jobs, they just don't want to. Your relatives are *using* you. Get out now, while it is \"only\" $10,421.29. Because it will only get bigger, and you'll never see a penny of it back.\n\nGo,  start to live your own independent life.", "NTA. I understand your ethical struggle and it's very much NTA of you to worry of whether you would be an asshole to leave them like that. Truth is: you're NOT your father. You're just a youthful who deserves to start his own life and think of his own affairs. You've been even too nice to support them until now. \n\nInfo: Why is your mother not working? Is she applying for jobs with no luck? Would she be able to support your two siblings and herself if she got a job? What is stopping her? Is she sick? If she was sick, maybe I would understand her situation better, but it still wouldn't make you an asshole for wanting to live your own life...", "NTA. Your mother took advantage of your dad and now she is taking advantage of you. She and your siblings are not your responsibility, This is the time where you should be off living your life, so go do that. She will have to figure out her financial situation on her own.", "NTA get out now before that 10k turns into 100k, do what you can for your brothers but unless you want to have your mom living off you forever just leave now while you can", "NTA for sure. You have done so much at such young age, given so much to your family. It's not your problem what happens from now on, you have to start looking out for your best interests. It's not fair for you to consider a second job when 3 family members don't even contribute.\n\nIf something were to happen to you tomorrow, your mother would start job hunting and your siblings would look for part time jobs and they'd work it out.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get a job", "NTA\n\nYour mom isn't working or looking for a job. Your legal-adult brother isn't helping, either. You are setting yourself on fire to keep them warm, so ask yourself: when does this end? At what point will they become more self-sufficient and not rely on you to subsidize them?\n\nMost of the time in these situations, the answer is 'never'. You will start burning out. You will push them to get a job, to contribute materially. They may seem agreeable, they may push back hard, but regardless of what they say\u2014they will not do anything until you force the issue by moving out and leaving them to fend for themselves.\n\nCut out the parts that will be difficult with no payoff, and jump straight to \"moving out and taking care of yourself.\"\n\n> At this point in time after keeping track of everything I've been promised I would be paid back for, I'm owed $10,421.29.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, you are very unlikely to see any portion of that money back.
