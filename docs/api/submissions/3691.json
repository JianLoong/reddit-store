All children call my wife their mum, she\u2019s a great parent; she got the eldest into gymnastics and swimming, she does their homework with them and they\u2019re really close - it\u2019s nice to see. It\u2019s hard to explain exactly how she\u2019s a good parent? She just is.\n\nWe found out we were expecting 8 months ago, and this caused our youngest to start acting out (nursery teachers told us it was completely normal for young children to regress when big news happens). 7 months into our pregnancy we lost the baby, it upset me but it\u2019s completely devastated my wife\u2026she acts like everything\u2019s normal, but she\u2019s crying herself to sleep.\n\nI don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth anymore, I\u2019m exhausted. We just lost a child, not just her.\n\nI\u2019d been trying to get ready for work, while my wife got the youngest ready and I guess we were having a rough morning because I heard my youngest tell my wife \u201cyou\u2019re not my mum, you don\u2019t love me\u201d obviously not exact wordings, it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s told my wife this (we don\u2019t even know how the youngest knows this)\n\nI went to work, when I came back the eldest told us that my wife dropped youngest off at nursery and then locked herself in our room, and apparently had been crying for a few hours then left\u2026I messaged her and got told \u201cthanks for helping me this morning, I\u2019m staying at my mothers. I\u2019m not in the mood to help with your child at the moment since you don\u2019t help me/tell her I\u2019m her mother\u201d\n\nYoungest deserves to know her background, we\u2019ve tried to explain to her step mother etc but she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll understand when she\u2019s older.\n\nI explained that I had work, she\u2019s handled it before but I\u2019ve been left on read. I apologised, didn\u2019t realise she was so unhappy but said at the end of the day youngest lost her sibling too and it\u2019s been a difficult transition, we\u2019re looking into family counselling. I did say I\u2019d appreciate her not having eldest witness her being this upset next time as she\u2019s still a child.\n\nIf I\u2019ve left any info out I\u2019ll answer, hands are greasy and it\u2019s hard to type! \n\nIt was a casual morning, she usually handles getting them ready and we\u2019ve had issues like this before that she\u2019s handled, honestly sometimes hearing things like this has become white noise now because I know my wife can handle it when I\u2019ve got to work.\n\nEdit; the reason I say not to be as upset in front of my eldest is because eldest went to her biological mum and told her she was worried about her mum (my wife) which I don\u2019t think is fair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669921605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9wihr/aita_for_not_comforting_my_wife_after_my_daughter/", "score": 6608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is rightfully distraught. You should be there to comfort her in her time of need.

I notice you used the phrase \" I guess *we* were having a rough morning\". Nah, dude you were having a fine morning while your wife is getting screamed at by YOUR affair baby.\n\nAnd your don't appreciate your eldest witnessing her be upset?  Why not? Being upset after an emotionally trying day is completely normal. Maybe instead of lecturing her via text, you should ask what you could to help. You should hope your wife forgives you.

Your 3 year old doesn't understand about big life changes yet and you've gone through two major life changes related to each other. Potential birth AND loss. Those are big things for a child. Sit down with youngest and have a conversation with her. With wife present so she can answer questions youngest has for her. Let them both know you love them.

She must get that from you. \n\nYTA\n    \nEdit for spacing", "YTA, and holy crap dude, your wife is emotionally a wreck from losing her baby not long ago.

Hope she leaves you.", "YTA so.. you go, get another woman pregnant because you and your partner are \"going through a rough patch\", then your partner puts all the effort in to be a mother to the child, then she loses her baby and clearly is extremely depressed and you don't get how hurtful it is when you let the \"you're not my real mom\" pass?\nDo you understand how hard it is to lose a baby, let alone that late into a pregnancy? She's probably blaming herself in some way on the lines of thinking of \"my body/I doesn't/don't have what it takes to be a mom\". There probably is some kind of self-blame there (though obviously it's not her fault) and you don't get she's more vulnerable to your daughter saying she's not her mom in that context? Very clear AH imo. Where's your empathy?\n\"I did say I\u2019d appreciate her not having eldest witness her being this upset next time as she\u2019s still a child.\" - wtf dude are you out of your mind?

My 3 year old sometimes says she doesn't love me.  It hurts but I know she doesn't mean it, she'll often run and hug me right after saying it.   But your wife is dealing with a massive loss.   You have 3 biological children and it sounds like she has none.  I'm sorry, but you really can't understand what she's going through and telling her to suck it up and hide her emotions is awful.  It's also not healthy for the older children, and doesn't teach them how to work through life's problems.   You need some serious therapy.", "YTA.\n\n\nYour wife has a miscarriage at seven months and is raising a child who is the product of your affair and of two other children who aren\u2019t hers and yet you can\u2019t extend an ounce of empathy or sympathy? \n\nShe stood by you through all your crap and now that she\u2019s suffering, you do nothing and blame her.\n\nJesus.

One of them told the youngest, probably more than once for a three year old to remember & repeat. This would not have been done because they were mad at mom, but mad at you & resentful of the child. \n\nSeeing that you don't offer your wife any support after having lost a baby, when your affair child says \"not my mom\", I can guess you are also oblivious to anything your older children went through after YOU disrupted their lives with bringing another child into the situation that was \"not mom's.\"\n\nYou all should have started counselling/therapy as soon as you bought the youngest into the family.", "YTA. Do you have any redeeming qualities that we don't know about?", "YTA dude, she is raising YOUR kids and you don't help her after the traumatic experience that she had, wrf is wrong with you? Oh she handled it before, f*ing pathetic excuse, now listen to me, you are going to make it up to her, I don't how but you will need to do it immediately, because for what is sounds you have everything to lose and she can go away, and honestly I think that will be the best for her", "YTA. Oh my god, my heart is breaking for your poor wife! She\u2019s married to a cheater with several children from different women who don\u2019t respect her, and lost her own CHILD in the womb.

You are beyond fortunate to have such a forgiving and caring partner who treats your affair child like her own, no less. Basically it sounds like your wife is the one who gives all the emotional support in your household and you just lap it up with the kids while ignoring her because she always handles it. And then when she needs just a tiny bit of support because she lost her pregnancy, you\u2019re just not there for her, even for a moment. She gives and gives, and everyone else takes and takes. She needs your support as an actual partner. \n\nAnd this is just a pet peeve of mine, but you and she were not both pregnant (you said \u201cour pregnancy\u201d). She was pregnant and you were both expecting a child. Pregnancy involves changes to the body that you do not go through, so while you both are devastated, she also is dealing with hormones and the aftermath of losing a late term pregnancy. She needs you. A lot. Please step up and be kind and caring to her.", "YTA - that poor woman. Stepmother to a 25 year old man\u2019s children when she was still a teenager, only for him to cheat on her and expect her to raise that child too with no emotional support and concern after her still birth. You\u2019re a horrendous person and I hope to god she leaves you", "YTA - your wife birthed a stillborn baby a few months ago. You know she\u2019s still devastated.l, you witness her sobbing daily. And when she says she\u2019s upset with you you CRITICIZE HER!!  My god the audacity. I hope she stays at her mom\u2019s where someone takes care of her and you can raise your own kids on your own.", "YTA - she is not biologically related to any of your children yet somehow she\u2019s managed to have a larger role raising them than you.

She had just turned \u201cthe legal age\u201d so he could avoid prison but she couldn\u2019t even drink alcohol legally. This was most likely her first long term relationship with an older man so chances are she\u2019s been thinking that this is just how relationships are supposed to be like or he\u2019s gaslit to her hell and back which would make sense since he justifies his affair as \u201ca one month break\u201d.\n\nYou have no care or compassion for your wife. You think your only responsibility to your family is being the breadwinner. It\u2019s hard to be believe you\u2019ve ever been selfless and put you wife\u2019s feelings as an sort of priority.", "YTA. your wife is a saint.", "YTA. For so many reasons in this post. \n\nYou were a 25 year old dad of 2, who took advantage of an 18 year old girl.

She sticks around and helps you raise the oldest two half of the time and the youngest full time.

You marry a barely legal teen and instead of enjoying her youth, she's playing mommy to YOUR children. Which probably means she's always had dreams of her own babies.... but instead, you knock some other woman up and pawn your affair baby off on her as well. She probably only stayed with you at this point because she's never had an adult life outside of you - you and those kids are her ENTIRE world. THAT'S SCARY. \n\nThen she finally gets to experience a pregnancy. The elation, the excitement. At 7 months it's not a miscarriage. It's a stillbirth. A 3 year old can't really understand what happened.

And your wife doesn\u2019t need *you* dismissing this as something she just needs to suck it up and deal with when you should\u2019ve jumped in and dealt with it *before* it became a recurring problem.

She felt the kicks. She felt the movement. She had already started bonding with the baby she was carrying. And then the baby died. She had to go through the trauma of knowing she was carrying a dead baby inside of her and then go through the process of birthing a dead baby, knowing she was going to leave the hospital bleeding, leaking milk out of her boobs, bloated and empty handed. I\u2019m sure she is probably blaming herself for losing the pregnancy.

It was 5 years ago yesterday that my baby was stillborn, and that pain still guts me at times. I also know that yes, you BOTH lost a child but until you've carried and delivered a baby, you can't possible fathom how much pain your wife is in. I can't imagine how much it hurt to hear those words from the little one, but also how unsupported she felt in that moment. I'm glad you're getting family counseling, it should help tremendously. Let your wife know, it doesn't seem like it will but it does get easier to live with, from an anonymous reddit user who knows how hard it is.\n\nMy judgement is that YTA in this situation. She needs a lot of support, comfort, and compassion right now. 8 months is not a long time in this journey.", "YTA \n\nShe literally lost a human that was growing in HER body.

You were getting ready for work but it would have taken 2 seconds to say \"listen to your mother\" or step in some way. The other part is you really told her to \"not be upset in front of\" your other kids. Sorry but you can't tell someone to just suck it up and hide their emotions in their own home and own family.

Rather than being upset that she went to her, you should be proud that she has the maturity to know that the problem is severe. You should be concerned that she went to her other mom rather than you. Your wife lost a child and could, and even most likely, has postpartum depression. Having her youngest tell her she's not her mom will not help in any way. Either one of you told the 4y/o the circumstances of her birth, which in my opinion she is far too young for, or she's acting out because she's 4.

She clearly is a great mom because she is parenting your children from 2 other women, including one affair, with love and time. You need to do a better job of dealing with your youngest.

I know someone who was in a very similar situation (minus the cheating) where the wife had a complete mental breakdown after a later term miscarriage to the point that he was so busy making sure she didn\u2019t completely self destruct that he never really had the opportunity to mourn. I understand stillbirth and miscarriage hits mothers in a different way but you are also allowed to mourn as a father and I can understand if you are burnt out. \n\nThat said, your wife has put up with A LOT. A lot a lot a lot. Raising multiple kids that aren\u2019t hers, you cheating, etc. And she was so young when you met her which doesn\u2019t sit well with me, but that\u2019s really beside the point. Yes, the youngest is having a hard time with this situation. Yes, she is young and doesn\u2019t really understand, and you are probably not equipped to handle this child\u2019s issues and need to get her professional help (which you at least seem interested in doing).

A simple \u201cI know that was very hard for you to hear but just know that I know you have really been her mother her whole life, even if she\u2019s too young to understand it yet. I will seek counseling for her and the family in general.\u201d Not hard. \n\nI can understand that you want to keep these issues within the family and don\u2019t want your other children\u2019s mothers knowing the details about private matters.

Worse, she's the mum to three of *your* kids, including one from what amounts to infidelity on your part. This was her child *with* you, and I'm sure that hurt all the more.

I was going to spend 12 weeks with him, never alone. Then I was going to have to go back to work without him. Still don't know how that's going to work out, 3 weeks to go.", "Yep, as per the quotes about employers who pay minimum wage would go lower if it was legal, the theory works for sex too - anyone that much older dating an 18yo would probably go younger if they could.\n\nTerminology suggests OP is British where legal age is 16, but official adulthood is 18 and adult men going younger is morally and socially frowned upon. They'd go younger if they could get away with it.", "Nah what be clearly needs to do is first he needs to find a new woman, make her care for all his current kids *and then* have baby #4 by cheating on her in another one night stand and making her raise that kid as well while constantly reminding her she\u2019s not their actual mom. \n\nMeanwhile bio mom receives a get out of jail free card.", "Wouldn't she have been 18 when they got together?  She was just a kid herself while he was 25, and she took on the responsibility of his two kids, then she accepted another child who resulted from his cheating on her, and then he decided she was only allowed a certain amount of time to grieve after a stillbirth.  She is taking responsibility for THREE children he created without her, and he can't give her support in return after the stillbirth and the physical and emotional consequences.  She must be a saint, or else he brainwashed her as a teenager so she expects to be mistreated. How clueless are you, OP? Yes, you are the AH!  It's a miracle she hasn't divorced you...yet.  Edit: when I typed this, I didn't realize she gave birth and lost her child only a month ago! Can OP possibly believe she would be over the death of her child plus the physical and hormonal symptoms in a month?", "easy she was 18 when they met and he was 25 with 2 kids whom he shoved on her, she probably doesn't think she can actually leave cause he uses the kids against her, he full on groomed her using his kids which is sad as hell", "This is super normal 3 year old emoting, especially when they HAVE experienced a loss in the family or some other unstabilizing event. Not to say it should be ignored, and this AH needs to parent his damn child, but it's not a red flag in itself.", "He apparently thinks she has been grieving too long, and it sounds like her stillbirth was only a MONTH ago!  Does he seriously imagine that the physical and emotional effects of giving birth and losing a child less less than a month?  OP you are the AH, and I can't believe your wife is willing to be married to you.  She takes care of 3 children you had without her (one from cheating during the marriage) and you should be kissing her feet, not getting on her case because she grieves for her dead child!  This is one of the worst things I have read.  How can you possibly take so much from her and give so little in return?", "Another Don\u2019t Forget is that he seems to make it clear the 3 year old wasn\u2019t happy about the baby. That\u2019s fine. She\u2019s practically still a baby herself. But to then throw out to his wife that \u201cat the end of the day youngest lost her sibling too.\u201d Seriously dude? She doesn\u2019t realize what\u2019s going on. She\u2019s not grieving her sibling. And I\u2019m sure that what the 3 year old said hit a nerve because of the situation but it\u2019s not just because 3YO said she\u2019s not her mom that the wife is so upset about. She\u2019s devastated  that she\u2019s not a bio mom yet. And the hormones. And the loss. And the f\u2019n lack of support. \nAND (!!!!) the whole \u201cI guess WE were having a a rough morning\u201d line made my blood boil.  He was not a part of that \u201cwe\u201d at all. Yeah, dick, you are most definitely the AH. Much worse than AH actually.", "She probably started off as his babysitter", "Oh god, probably. I wonder how long he knew her before he started \u201cdating\u201d her at 18\u2026", "OP doesn't like it because it makes him look bad. And he has the emotional intelligence of a wet fart.\n\nEdit: almost forgot\n\nYTA OP!", "You left out the part about how he thinks a *3 year old* \u201cdeserves to know her background.\u201d Despite the fact, which he even admits, she doesn\u2019t understand. \n\nSounds like OP has a long history of dumping problems on everyone around him and expects them to clean up his mess. Even toddlers. \n\nYTA, OP. And if you care about your family you would get yourself in therapy to find out why you treat them like this.\n\nEdit: punctuation", "She was 18 when she met him, and for sure she has sel esteem issues. He was around her like a predator, getting a living nanny", "I love the AITA\u2019s where the OP is clearly hoping to take this to their spouse as evidence how bad they are, and instead it\u2019s 100% \u201cshe should leave you.\u201d", "Yep and he\u2019s been gaslighting her about it ever since. Calling it a rough patch and downplaying the entire situation is not just for us, it\u2019s for his wife too so she thinks this is normal and she should accept this life.", "He didn\u2019t feel baby hiccup and kick everyday. To suddenly not feel your baby anymore and also not have baby in your arms is beyond heartbreaking. The bond between a mother and her unborn baby is special.", "She needs to leave him so he doesn\u2019t steal the rest of her years.", "Also, the kids all have bio-moms who haven't given up parental rights.  If she walks, she loses all access to the kids she spent 10 years loving and caring for.\n\nThat would keep a lot of people holding onto a marriage, literally for the kids.", "This asshole made a lot of us \u201csometimes i forget things and screw up a little\u201d type guys look alright to some of the people reading this thread\u2026OP\u2019s wife\u2019s suffering was not worth it but a few partners are gonna get a pass for a couple missteps today. \n\nThat said, jesus OP there is no way you read this before you hit post. There isn\u2019t one person with their head not stuck up their own ass that would read that and not notice how big of an asshole they\u2019re being. \n\nBuy your wife a spa day first and foremost\u2026then for fucks sake apologize and do better holy fucking shit\u2026DO BETTER.", "And with the wife still bleeding and now going to her mums, you can bet OP is still getting it elsewhere.\n\nIf this poor woman is stupid enough to come back, she will probably be looking after a newborn in about 9 months as well as the other 3.", "Oh, I had done the maths but not that far back, only that she was 18 when they got together. 13 years age difference - that's like a big sister. No wonder the 15yo went to tell her mum, she cares about her and while she may call her stepmum \" mum\", they might possibly have a relationship that's more like sisterhood. I feel so sad for OP's wife. \n\nEdited: I wondered where the wife's family was but realised she has gone to stay with her mum, which is good.", "OP\u2019s wife was only 18 when they got together, so in three years time his daughter should be mature enough to take on two stepchildren and one giant AH", "My coworker's baby is measuring teeny tiny at 3lb 6oz at 32 weeks and her OB has her on medications to help fetal development because baby is so small. No way is a 26 weeker that big if a baby 6 weeks further along is considered seriously underdeveloped at less than 2/3 of that weight.", "Predators. \n\nThat\u2019s the kind of \u201cdude \u201c that you are speaking of.", "The ex already knows. She's the ex.", "BECAUSE SHE DESERVES TO KNOW!!!\n\nThis is just mind blowing\u2026 \n\nNo, OP, kids need to know things that are age appropriate. A three year old can not process correctly the fact that she is a result of your cheating and the nice lady raising her is not her mommy.\n\nI don\u2019t even want to imagine how he phrased this to a toddler.", "I\u2019m thinking she was also very young and possibly not ready to be a parent but somehow got pressured to carry to term to provide OP with another kid"]}
