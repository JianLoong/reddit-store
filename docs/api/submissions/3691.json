All children call my wife their mum, she\u2019s a great parent; she got the eldest into gymnastics and swimming, she does their homework with them and they\u2019re really close - it\u2019s nice to see. It\u2019s hard to explain exactly how she\u2019s a good parent? She just is.\n\nWe found out we were expecting 8 months ago, and this caused our youngest to start acting out (nursery teachers told us it was completely normal for young children to regress when big news happens). 7 months into our pregnancy we lost the baby, it upset me but it\u2019s completely devastated my wife\u2026she acts like everything\u2019s normal, but she\u2019s crying herself to sleep.\n\nI don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth anymore, I\u2019m exhausted. We just lost a child, not just her.\n\nI\u2019d been trying to get ready for work, while my wife got the youngest ready and I guess we were having a rough morning because I heard my youngest tell my wife \u201cyou\u2019re not my mum, you don\u2019t love me\u201d obviously not exact wordings, it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s told my wife this (we don\u2019t even know how the youngest knows this)\n\nI went to work, when I came back the eldest told us that my wife dropped youngest off at nursery and then locked herself in our room, and apparently had been crying for a few hours then left\u2026I messaged her and got told \u201cthanks for helping me this morning, I\u2019m staying at my mothers. I\u2019m not in the mood to help with your child at the moment since you don\u2019t help me/tell her I\u2019m her mother\u201d\n\nYoungest deserves to know her background, we\u2019ve tried to explain to her step mother etc but she\u2019s young, she\u2019ll understand when she\u2019s older.\n\nI explained that I had work, she\u2019s handled it before but I\u2019ve been left on read. I apologised, didn\u2019t realise she was so unhappy but said at the end of the day youngest lost her sibling too and it\u2019s been a difficult transition, we\u2019re looking into family counselling. I did say I\u2019d appreciate her not having eldest witness her being this upset next time as she\u2019s still a child.\n\nIf I\u2019ve left any info out I\u2019ll answer, hands are greasy and it\u2019s hard to type! \n\nIt was a casual morning, she usually handles getting them ready and we\u2019ve had issues like this before that she\u2019s handled, honestly sometimes hearing things like this has become white noise now because I know my wife can handle it when I\u2019ve got to work.\n\nEdit; the reason I say not to be as upset in front of my eldest is because eldest went to her biological mum and told her she was worried about her mum (my wife) which I don\u2019t think is fair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669921605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9wihr/aita_for_not_comforting_my_wife_after_my_daughter/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is rightfully distraught. You should be there to comfort her in her time of need.

I notice you used the phrase \" I guess *we* were having a rough morning\". Nah, dude you were having a fine morning while your wife is getting screamed at by YOUR affair baby.\n\nAnd your don't appreciate your eldest witnessing her be upset?  Why not? Being upset after an emotionally trying day is completely normal. Maybe instead of lecturing her via text, you should ask what you could to help. You should hope your wife forgives you.

Your 3 year old doesn't understand about big life changes yet and you've gone through two major life changes related to each other. Potential birth AND loss. Those are big things for a child. Sit down with youngest and have a conversation with her. With wife present so she can answer questions youngest has for her. Let them both know you love them.

She's probably blaming herself in some way on the lines of thinking of \"my body/I doesn't/don't have what it takes to be a mom\". There probably is some kind of self-blame there (though obviously it's not her fault) and you don't get she's more vulnerable to your daughter saying she's not her mom in that context? Very clear AH imo. Where's your empathy?\n\"I did say I\u2019d appreciate her not having eldest witness her being this upset next time as she\u2019s still a child.\" - wtf dude are you out of your mind?

My 3 year old sometimes says she doesn't love me.  It hurts but I know she doesn't mean it, she'll often run and hug me right after saying it.   But your wife is dealing with a massive loss.   You have 3 biological children and it sounds like she has none.  I'm sorry, but you really can't understand what she's going through and telling her to suck it up and hide her emotions is awful.  It's also not healthy for the older children, and doesn't teach them how to work through life's problems.

One of them told the youngest, probably more than once for a three year old to remember & repeat. This would not have been done because they were mad at mom, but mad at you & resentful of the child. \n\nSeeing that you don't offer your wife any support after having lost a baby, when your affair child says \"not my mom\", I can guess you are also oblivious to anything your older children went through after YOU disrupted their lives with bringing another child into the situation that was \"not mom's.\"\n\nYou all should have started counselling/therapy as soon as you bought the youngest into the family.", "YTA.

You are beyond fortunate to have such a forgiving and caring partner who treats your affair child like her own, no less.

And then when she needs just a tiny bit of support because she lost her pregnancy, you\u2019re just not there for her, even for a moment. She gives and gives, and everyone else takes and takes. She needs your support as an actual partner. \n\nAnd this is just a pet peeve of mine, but you and she were not both pregnant (you said \u201cour pregnancy\u201d). She was pregnant and you were both expecting a child. Pregnancy involves changes to the body that you do not go through, so while you both are devastated, she also is dealing with hormones and the aftermath of losing a late term pregnancy. She needs you. A lot. Please step up and be kind and caring to her.", "YTA - that poor woman. Stepmother to a 25 year old man\u2019s children when she was still a teenager, only for him to cheat on her and expect her to raise that child too with no emotional support and concern after her still birth.

She had just turned \u201cthe legal age\u201d so he could avoid prison but she couldn\u2019t even drink alcohol legally. This was most likely her first long term relationship with an older man so chances are she\u2019s been thinking that this is just how relationships are supposed to be like or he\u2019s gaslit to her hell and back which would make sense since he justifies his affair as \u201ca one month break\u201d.\n\nYou have no care or compassion for your wife.

For so many reasons in this post. \n\nYou were a 25 year old dad of 2, who took advantage of an 18 year old girl.

You marry a barely legal teen and instead of enjoying her youth, she's playing mommy to YOUR children. Which probably means she's always had dreams of her own babies.... but instead, you knock some other woman up and pawn your affair baby off on her as well. She probably only stayed with you at this point because she's never had an adult life outside of you - you and those kids are her ENTIRE world. THAT'S SCARY. \n\nThen she finally gets to experience a pregnancy. The elation, the excitement. At 7 months it's not a miscarriage. It's a stillbirth. A 3 year old can't really understand what happened.

And your wife doesn\u2019t need *you* dismissing this as something she just needs to suck it up and deal with when you should\u2019ve jumped in and dealt with it *before* it became a recurring problem.

She felt the kicks. She felt the movement. She had already started bonding with the baby she was carrying. And then the baby died. She had to go through the trauma of knowing she was carrying a dead baby inside of her and then go through the process of birthing a dead baby, knowing she was going to leave the hospital bleeding, leaking milk out of her boobs, bloated and empty handed. I\u2019m sure she is probably blaming herself for losing the pregnancy.

Wtf dude. Do you seriously need to post in this sub to know if youre the asshole lol. Plus what your youngest daughter said to your wife is really rude and condescending considering your wife has accepted and raised said daughter as her own when that daughter is a product of a one night stand affair, especially after your wife has a stillbirth with her 7 months old baby. That is a fucking awful thing for your youngest to say to your wife. Do you really not for a moment consider how she feels after losing her baby and having to deal with the attitude from your kid. Plus its not the first time your kid has said such a mean thing to your wife, dont you keep her in check at all honestly. Maybe wash your youngest daughters mouth with soap so she learns to be grateful to the mother figure that is raising her instead. It is not an easy thing for a wife to accept a child who is the result of a husbands affair. By now she'd probably be happier not being your wife tbh. Or maybe you should be paying her as your babysitter for your three kids instead considering you don't really treat her like a wife anyway. Your eldest daughter is even more worried for your wife than you are. Damn I'm really sorry for your wife I wish I could just hug her and tell her she deserves so much better.

I know someone who was in a very similar situation (minus the cheating) where the wife had a complete mental breakdown after a later term miscarriage to the point that he was so busy making sure she didn\u2019t completely self destruct that he never really had the opportunity to mourn. I understand stillbirth and miscarriage hits mothers in a different way but you are also allowed to mourn as a father and I can understand if you are burnt out. \n\nThat said, your wife has put up with A LOT. A lot a lot a lot. Raising multiple kids that aren\u2019t hers, you cheating, etc. And she was so young when you met her which doesn\u2019t sit well with me, but that\u2019s really beside the point. Yes, the youngest is having a hard time with this situation. Yes, she is young and doesn\u2019t really understand, and you are probably not equipped to handle this child\u2019s issues and need to get her professional help (which you at least seem interested in doing).

A simple \u201cI know that was very hard for you to hear but just know that I know you have really been her mother her whole life, even if she\u2019s too young to understand it yet.

Worse, she's the mum to three of *your* kids, including one from what amounts to infidelity on your part. This was her child *with* you, and I'm sure that hurt all the more.

It also isn\u2019t unreasonable that she got so upset after just losing a pregnancy.", "I agree with this.\n\nI can understand if he didn't know that the comment from the 3 year old upset his wife at the time.\n\nHowever the comment about his eldest is out of order. It isn't  his wife went out of her way to get the eldest involved. The eldest overhead her crying and was concerned like a normal person would be.", "This part completely.  OP keeps looking at it as what his wife was doing for him, when it needs to be what is he doing to help her, not only in general but with HIS kids?  How is he stepping up now to help his wife, and children, get through this tough time?  He keeps piling more and more on her, but not taking on anything himself to help her. \n\nI mean, they just lost the baby (not a miscarriage) a month or so ago!  My best friend lost a baby at 20 weeks, they had named her.  They had a funeral for her, joined a support group...has the OP's wife had a chance to do any of this?", "\ud83d\udd25", "i\u2019m not surprised she hasn\u2019t, if this is her first adult relationship and she\u2019s been thrown into parenting from the very beginning it must be hard to imagine her life any other way", "Yea. I have a brother born at 27 weeks who is 15 now. Losing a child no matter what is traumatic I'm certain! However there's a reason there's a different term for miscarriage and still birth, there's differences in so many areas. And this was definitely the second.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I cannot even imagine.", "This is very important.  Op needs to imagine how he'd feel if the situation was reversed.  If his wife was carrying someone else's child after their one month break.", "I hope he reads this one. It\u2019s so dead on. What a gigantic asshole.", "I'm actually equally worried about the younger child as the wife. She starts acting out when the woman she knows wasn't her mom was having a \"real child\" and then when the kid she wished wasn't coming died she's going to have a helluva lot of mixed feelings about it. Possibly even guilt. Definitely feelings about her pay grade.", "With no protection it seems....to make it worse", "They were on a break!!!", "I was looking for this comment!", "And her hormones are still a mess and everything else that comes with a pregnancy, on top of the grieving. \n\nShe's a star just for getting out of bed every day. And he's less than a useless lump of flesh, not even helping to parent his own kids. Just awful.", "And her actual due date is quickly approaching. My heart hurts for this woman.", "And her hormones are literally ALL over the place post pregnancy PLUS grief. DUDE - MAN UP!! YTA!!", "There\u2019s a good chance she\u2019s still bleeding too, if it was only a month ago. She\u2019s probably got all the postpartum symptoms, without the joy of holding her baby. The poor woman.", "Umm... No. The lactation window is actually pretty darn brief. Not to take away from your point, this whole situation is awful, but breastfeeding has to start right away because otherwise the milk doesn't come in.\n\nIf the initial colostrum isn't pumped or eaten by a baby, the milk does not come in. In most cases anyway. And that window is around 3 days.", "And is still healing from the birth, depending on how it went down. Her body is still ravaged from a full term birth and there is no baby there, just wild little toddlers saying hurtful things, and OP can\u2019t even help by setting THAT one straight.", "I feel for her and I feel for the children. Imagine growing up with such an asshole, there's no way this doesn't bleed into everything else he does.", "Then for her sake let's hope she's not in the US, or anywhere else with these barbaric laws.", "I have no issue with starting another marriage after a failed one, but I find the fact he was basically looking for the youngest woman he could get DISGUSTING.", "I had the same conclusion", "For real, and I thought people couldn\u2019t get worse. I hope the wife sees this as a wake up call and serves OP divorce papers honestly. I know it\u2019s usually a big leap on most posts and totally uncalled for- but not for this one. OP doesn\u2019t deserve her", "That doesn\u2019t give him any reason to be less of a partner and father. He is a huge asshole and I doubt therapy is gonna make him see that. He\u2019s causing serious issues in his children\u2019s mental health so good luck with emotionless and hiding emotion children that gets raised from this", "We are getting therapy, I am going therapy separately as is my wife.", "Exactly! He is so fucking ungrateful and unkind to his wife. I hope she leaves his ass so he has to be a parent to his own damn kids.", "Please this isn't the first the the chid has said it and  give no fs where he was going to the moon or to work him earing his daughter say that needed addressing. It would of only taken 5 min t ask his wife honey are you ok? If she was then ok if not step in like he should of", "Is that really a common thing to say? Maybe my kids just love me too much but never once have they ever told me or my partner that we aren\u2019t their parents.", "Agree, based on the calculations she started out with him at 18 and he was 25. Just an awful, awful post all over. I pray it\u2019s fake.", "Thank you it\u2019s very kind of you. It was a long time ago so it doesn\u2019t hurt as terribly. But no parent should ever have to deal with that. Having a garbage support system on top of it must be devastating for ops wife.", "It took me a minute to catch this but omg that\u2019s hilarious.", "That is  not true for everyone.  I know people who started lactated well before their due date.", "Oh I wholeheartedly agree.\nHis edit as well... I don't think he gets what the problem is. Pretty sure a 15 year old won't be traumatized from seeing their mom be rightfully devastated cause she lost her 7 month old baby. Pretty sure it will fuck up a 15 year old if their dad acts like expressing emotions is shameful.", "You definitely need it.  She deserves better and so do your kids.", "Whats ur wifes reddit, ill give her all the reasons to leave ur ass. Absolutely disgusting behavior from a person who shares my sex. Cant believe you wrote this whole thing and thought what u said would be approved by humans who actual emotions. Disgusting.", "Good. Maybe a therapist can help her realize she\u2019s been taken advantage of since she was eighteen years old and she can GTFO of this \u201cmarriage.\u201d My god, man. YTA doesn\u2019t seem sufficient, but I don\u2019t want to get banned.", "Are you being true with your therapist? Especially about your selfishness and refusal to support your partner and your family? Honesty and transparency are essential to make progress in therapy.", "It\u2019s obviously not working for you. When you say that your getting therapy, are you talking about physical therapy for an injury or something?", "babe i think you need a little more then therapy", "Sadly, I'm confident he will find a way to lure another very very young woman to take all the parental responsibility while being his eye candy very quickly. :(", "Here's the part that's missing though....\n\n> I explained that I had work, she\u2019s handled it before\n\nHe specifically claims she's handled it before. I assume in the past she handled it well enough that he didn't need to intervene. I also hope that he has talked to the kid about it on previous occasions. You're assuming he hasn't. If you want to base the judgment on that... you probably need more info.\n\nThe dude is **NOT** doing a good job taking care of his saint of a wife, but I'm not sure he was an asshole for **THIS ACT** based on given info.", "Yes, people can create colostrum well before, as early as 20 weeks. But once the baby is out it's a short window.", "My five year old has seen me cry. She gives me a hug and says I love you I\u2019m sure if a literal toddler can handle emotions that are sad so can his 15 year old. Also it\u2019ll create a child who fakes emotion. Like I had that issue took a bit but I figured it out eventu", "For real!!! I hope this post opens his eyes but somehow I doubt it.", "Ugh I know! He needs them young and naive, otherwise they\u2019ll know how gross he is and steer clear. I feel for all the young women who fall prey to toxic, shitty, predatory men.", "Yea exactly. It's important children experience their parents express emotions. It would only be bad if someone went and exploited their child as therapist or friend to a degree the child feels like the roles are reversed and they have to be the caretaker, but nothing about op's wife and their situation sounds like that is the case. He literally said she acts like everything is fine (which again.. So exhausting and she shouldn't have to. I really feel for that woman)", "As a parent absolutely. Like my kids are five and four so like they can\u2019t grasp mom has depression but they can grasp moms sad movie time or maybe a hug. Like my toddlers understand that crying and being angry and any other negative emotion is NORMAL. They have their own small way of making people feel better but still if they can understand it most teenagers can to if it\u2019s a normal thing.  I pity that women she has a cheating husband and he has a shitty fucking relationship with emotions. like no don\u2019t make a child your therapist but simply going well mommy is sad at the moment and just needs a good cry."]}
