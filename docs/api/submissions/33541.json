(Sadly no adult helped us with this parent, we didn't have any family around us, but we siblings grew up learned what we could about mental health and had the parent forcibly admitted after some scary episodes and probably saved their life - they're on medication and doing better now).  \n\nDespite all this traumatic history if my husband wanted to see some proof because of something playing on his mind I would also rub the proof in his face before scolding him for having negative thoughts like that but would also forgive him if it wasn't excessive and often (and in the back of my mind I'd be slightly triggered so I'd actually try and not scold him too much and take a walk because he shouldn't be punished for what my parent did). \n\nOP's wife has either shutoff from the relationship and may even be distancing and preparing to leave so doesn't feel the need to simply walk over and show the new perfume bottle or the new perfume bottle doesn't exist.

But it's equally possible that he's been honestly trying to have a conversation about her seeming distant, and that she consistently blew him off.

Then he said I am hard to love sometimes.\n\n He has done this throughout our 19 years together, and I feel like I'm going crazy and don't know my reality.

So based on your husband that would be at least four times a month for six months. Every week basically. And you would still be like, yeah this is fine and I'll entertain your paranoia. Not me. I'd be tired as hell of it and by 6 months he would be getting my full petty. There's a chance she's cheating but it's also likely she's tired of having to defend herself and deny the same shit over and over. Literally no way to know. OP needs to get proof or STFU.

Some people are so committed to the narrative they created in their head, more often than not because they're doing the dirty and projecting it on you. \n\nIt can be that you cannot prove that you did NOT do something, and it's on them to prove you did. For example, I dated a guy years back who thought I was cheating. I wasn't,  he was, as I found out later. But since he couldn't find any proof of cheating (because it wasn't freaking happening!!!), he was sure I was just very good at covering my tracks. Kinda like the joke where the woman doesn't find a single strand of hair on her husband's jacket so she concludes he's cheating with a bald woman. \n\nHe proposed I take a polygraph test. That's right. A polygraph test. I could have done it, since I had nothing to hide, but I felt this was him taking it way, way to far, especially since there was nothing that could have clued him in that some cheating was happening. I found that incredibly disrespectful and straight up refused. Naturally, that convinced him that I was indeed cheating. And from what he's shown me, even if I took the test and it came back I was truthful, he would have accused me of being good enough of a liar to cheat a polygraph test. There was no winning with him. Whatever story he made up in his mind was the absolute truth. Good riddance! \n\nPoint is we should have enough critical thinking to figure out if it's worth giving in to their demands of proving/disproving something or if we're just creating a precedent where we'd constantly have to prove ourselves to them.", ">if you were to get mad at being accused about the perfume, you would show him and then get mad\n\nNah bro. After six months of being falsely accused, I would be in full FAFO mode, aka super petty. No way would I pony up the perfume. I'd hide it or even throw it away just to fuck with him for being a big enough tool to accuse me constantly for SIX months. And to be clear, my husband 100% knows this and would never accuse me without *actual* proof (which he would never have because it wouldn't happen anyway). And vice versa. I would never accuse my husband without proof.
