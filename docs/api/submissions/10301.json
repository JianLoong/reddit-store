Lisa sounds immature from your description, and I'm unclear on why she's criticizing you in the first place. She's not your mom, and she doesn't need to be in your business. She's probably jealous that you don't have kids and the responsibility she did at your age. Take your time. Have some fun while you're young!", "NTA.  \nBut this is your mother's house. Her house, her rules, including not answering back when her friends are rude. However, you don't have to spend time with this friend. Next time she comes over, grab a glass of milk and a sandwich (or whatever) and go to your room. If your mother protests, tell her you refuse to be insulted by her friends.", "op=nta\n\nMaybe Lisa should stick her nose out of your business.", "NTA.  Mom's friend is bullying you, sounds like middle aged mean girl jealousy.  Why is your mom sticking up for her when she is attacking you?  What's that all about?  Anyway, the older woman picking on the younger woman's life circumstances and choices screams of envy, jealousy, and regret.  I've seen it and experienced it.", "NTA. Lisa is jealous of you, so she tries to make you feel inadequate to build herself up. Good on you for standing up to her. Do it every time she starts in on you.", "I didn\u2019t graduate college until I was near my 30s. No shame in that. And you\u2019re NTA", "NTA. Definitely NTA.", "NTA, and I\u2019m a bit concerned that your own mother won\u2019t stand up to her friend when she makes comments attacking and degrading you. If this is a pattern, you may want to sit down and chat with your mother about this, and explain that you will be avoiding interactions with her \u201cfriends\u201d in the future if she allows them to treat you like this.", "So Lisa got knocked up at 16 and wants to throw shade at you? She had that coming. NTA", "NTA but she had it coming. Good for you.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it sounds like she regrets how her life turned out and is taking it out on you. She may even be jealous that you are returning to school when she didn't.", "So many people love dishing it out but hate when it gets flung back in their direction.", "NTA LOL at this woman thinking she can criticize every aspect of your life, but how dare you talk about her? That\u2019s not the way it works, lady.\nAlso, a 22-year-old who is pursuing higher education should be single and child free! This isn\u2019t the 1800s.  This is the time to focus on yourself and school.", "Ah, another \"fuck around and find out\" AITA post.\n\nNTA OP, Lisa needs to be humbled if she's treating you like this. She has no right to try and demean you, and you didn't \"degrade\" her at all.\n\nIf anything, you just turned a mirror on her and she hated what she saw.", "You are NTA. \u201cI mOvEd OuT aT 18!\u201d Good for you, Lisa. Things aren\u2019t the same as they were when she was 18. Good for you for defending yourself and good luck with everything!", "NTA. Avoid this person with all energy available.", "Like having kids at 22 is what she wanted to brag about?  Having kids is great (if that's what you want).  Doesn't mean that everyone has to do what you did and by a certain  age.  The elder is the AH.  Not you. NTA.", "NTA- and Lisa is a little punk. She can dish it but definitely couldn't take it. Please don't you dare ever Apologize unless she does so genuinely first", "NTA. Make a reputation for yourself as someone who will not be spoken down to. They won\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is to establish firm boundaries for yourself because you have self-respect.", "So you're on a gap year from school college/university but she got pregnant at 15/16? And she wants to criticise you for your life choices? FFS. NTA.", "NTA. Lisa sucks. And, not for nothing, so does your mom, OP.", "NTA. Lisa needs to learn take it if she's going to dish it out. You did nothing wrong. Your mom is just mad because her friend made herself look stupid.", "Something about glass houses comes to mind... NTA", "NTA. Classic can dish it but can't take it. Hopefully she learns to shut her mouth after this. And good on you for standing up for yourself! If Mom continues to bring it up, only answer by asking her why her friend can questions your life choices but you can't question hers. Do not apologize. You are not in the wrong.", "Hahahahahaha~ NTA", "NTA - Good for you. You were rational, and simply stated the truth of things. Lisa is clearly being condescending, and insulting you on purpose, all you did was respond with the truth. If your mom thinks what you said was insulting, then why the hell does she allow Lisa to say it to you on a regular basis?", "Nta and maybe mom should look for more friends. Cause misery loves company and that miserable lady is trying to take your mom with her base on the reaction at the end", "HA! Being a parent by no means makes you a good person or better than anyone. There are a LOT of selfish assholes with children. There's lots of parents who wish they had waited. There's some who regret the whole thing and know they shouldn't have become parents but were pressured to do so, by stupid comments like that. I don't even want to imagine the burden that they carry. And it never ends. \n\nIf she doesn't like criticism, she shouldn't be critical. And your mom needs to step up and shut that shit down. No one should be coming into your space, making you feel bad. It doesn't matter how old you are.", "NTA \nI remember once when I was in college, my aunt was insulting my Mom. Some crap about because my parents only had one child, they must not have a happy marriage. Me being sarcastic with no filter promptly said the fact that I have to announce myself loudly if I come home early so I don't catch them having sex again says otherwise to their unhappy marriage. \nMy aunt was so offended that I dared to speak to her like that. She told my parents that they needed to make me apologize, and they said no way, I don't have to apologize for standing up for them or myself. \nIf someone wants to be a bully, they better learn real quick that there will be someone else out there who won't just quietly take their shit.\n\n\n Plus, this crap about children fulfilling a life purpose just really pisses me off.", "NTA, deserved for her", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhy the fuck is your mom letting her talk like that to you? Who is she to be passing judgment on you? \n\nI\u2019d ask mom why she feels it\u2019s OK for her \u201cfriend\u201d to talk to you like that.", "NTA. Lisa sounds like a bully who needs to make herself feel better by bringing other people down. \n\nGood for you!", "NTA lol moving out at 18 to share rent with someone else in 1995 and then it not working out vs living at home as a single person at 22 in the year 2023 when rent is probably triple?\n\nLisa needs to chill. You are doing fine.", "NTA\n\nPeople judge others when they are so insecure and upset about their life, they need to focus on others.\n\nNever feel bad for how fast or slow you need to take to do what is best for you in life.", "NTA. Truth always hurts.", "Did Lisa have her first kid when she was 16? Sounds like Lisa is probably just hating on you for not having kids and going to school, something she couldn\u2019t do cuz she had kids to raise as a single mom.", "NTA she really sounds like a lovely person to be around!", "u/ThrowRA-collegeexpen First off, nobody is too old for higher education. My boyfriend and his best friend both got their BAs at 37 and finished MBAs at 39. My boyfriend is in his second year of his PhD program and he's almost 42. The only thing that's important is that you graduate! \n\nSecond, Lisa is a bully. You don't need to hang out with her- especially because your mom won't defend you when she makes these remarks. She got what she deserved when you clapped back. Keep calling her out if you happen to hear her say something else. \n\nNTA", "NTA at all.\n\nFirst of all, generations can't compare to one another. When my grandfather was 25, he had fought in WW1, suffered several gas attacks, lost friends, lost his hearing to artillery and screaming mules (he was a muleteer) and had PTSD. What had she done even remotely comparable.\n\nScrew her. If she's too dumb to realize every generation has different stressors, the hell with her. Having kids is great, but guess what? Not having kids is great too.\n\nWhy isn't your mom defending you. Lisa had a pretty asshole comment.  It was really rude. You graduated right when you were supposed to.  You are doing what you are supposed to and ole Lisa is whinging and NOT doing what she is supposed to, namely be fuckin' supportive. Jeez!", "What an epic mum you have, letting a friend degrade you like that, NTA", "Your mom is like her friend. Fine with verbal abuse. Acting all superior... NTA.", "She jealous\u2026nta", ">\u201cWhen I was 22 I was a mother of two and you\u2019re an unmarried young girl who lives with your mom, works part time and is still in school.\u201d\n\n\nDoes your mother have an issue with you living with her?  Does she want you to move out?  I can't imagine why Lisa feels that she can make comments like that to your face in front of your mother unless she knows your mother won't respond.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Nta.", "NTA Lisa can get fucked", "you are NTA. she's awful, and your mom isn't exactly covering herself with glory either.", "I don\u2019t like your mom or Lisa. NTA. You turned her words around on her. If what you did degraded Lisa then why is it not the same when Lisa does it to you?", "NTA\nYour mom's friend was trying to brag and insult you at the same time. Why I don't understand. Your mom though, didn't stick up for you. So wrong.", "Your comments should NEVER have happened because your mother should have shown her \"friend\" the door as soon as this person started to denigrate you.  NTA", "Yeah some people just have to put others down to feel better. My sister does it all the time. I have almost stopped telling her things and our conversations are now me just listening to her.", "NTA- how hilarious.  Don\u2019t dish it, if you can\u2019t take it. Good for you OP.", "NTA", "ETA That is an awful thing to say regardless of the initial probing, which was also shitty. \n\nThat being said, I salute you for saying it and would not tell you to apologize. You can be an asshole and be right. :)", "Exactly what I was going to say. I graduated at 25 and it literally never comes up in conversation anyway (unless I bring it up). Also, not a single person in my family graduated undergrad within 4 years - it\u2019s hard even without health problems!", "Exactly. Having some maturity and perspective on life can be a huge asset when starting a new career.", "I graduated at 24, OP! I didn't have a good excuse like medical reasons either. I kept switching majors and schools and then took a gap year myself because I didn't know what I really wanted. I started college at the age of 17 too, so it took me 7 years to get a 4-year degree!\n\nI'm in my 50s now. I have a great career and a great life. It doesn't matter when you finish, just that you *do* finish.", "If yah can\u2019t take the heat, stay out of the kitchen!!!!", "I'm disappointed in the mother for not having OP's back here and is telling her off for doing to Lisa what Lisa is doing to OP. What, Lisa can degrade your daughter, that's ok. But daughter can't serve Lisa equally? \nYea, disappointed in OP's mom.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I see this is already brought up. But I'll still leave mine.", "Yeah, OP, ask your mom why she cares more about you responding in kind to her friend rather than someone degrading her own daughter? I would go burn someone's house down if they talked to my daughter that way. I don't care who they are.", "NTA-- And, Pointing out that OP is *ALSO* an *Adult* and Lisa is the AH and so is the Mom!", "Congratulations in advance, catsareweirdroomates! Love the name, too. Though my cat just said, \"We're not roommates. We're overlords.\"", "How is OP stating that Lisa was in the same position she's commenting on (with the addition of two children she had when she was possibly still a teenager) an attack? If you think Lisa saying the same exact thing wasn't an attack, then you just have a problem with people younger than you pointing out your hypocrisy because ElDeRs DeSeRvE respect. News flash - EVERYONE deserves respect, regardless of age. However, it seems many older people confuse \"respect\" with \"recognizing my authority.\"\n\nAnd before you go assuming - no, I am not a \"young person.\" I am middle-aged. My parents just raised me well.", "That\u2019s the point. Middle aged people sometimes see 22 year olds that they\u2019ve known for years as kids & expect to give them unsolicited advice/comments unchallenged in the same way they did when they were kids.", "Mom lets her friend insult her daughter and was appalled when you finally fought back. She's enabling her friend to abuse her. I'll bet the mother doesn't ever stand up to this bully friend. NTA. Good for you for knocking her off of her high horse. Next time you could add that you still managed to get your degree despite your medical issues yet she never finished college due to her kids.", "Can also twist the knife and mention how breeding isn't really an accomplishment since it's literally what we evolved to do.  The mother being an AH is the bigger problem, though", "Migraines suck. I hope you're feeling better now.", "Yeah no -- that's 100% different.  If someone came up to me and called me overweight, even if it was a fact it was unkind and none of their GD business.  The sole purpose of that comment was to hurt and demean.  OP's scenario is more similar to mom's overweight friend telling OP she needs to drop a few with OP responding \"you should talk.\"  Big difference IMHO.", "the downside to not saying anything would be that Lisa would continue to harp at her with no one ever having her back. While it was \"mean\" to repeat the words back to Lisa, after correcting the facts, it was well-deserved. A person should not have to endure people constantly insulting them and always turning the other cheek because that would be \"nicer.\"", "I'm not sure that's true. Let's go with the assumption that, had OP not said anything in retort, Lisa would have maintained that what she said to OP wasn't mean, just factual. So, in essence, OP was operating on the insinuated intent that Lisa herself assigned to the comments - it's just facts. Because, even if OP felt the words were mean, she can rightfully say she was operating on the assumption that this was a Facts Party, not Lisa just being a dick. Because, if Lisa was just being a dick, why should OP have to take it?\n\nIf the argument is intent, then Lisa can't have it both ways. Either it is insulting or it is just stating facts. If Lisa and OP'S mother think what OP said was mean or degrading, then, by default,  Lisa was just being an asshole for no reason.", "What's different here is the INTENT.  I believe Lisa was bragging that she was \"all grown up\" by OP's age, having had children.  OP merely pointed out that she wasn't as independent then as she claimed to be.  If anyone was mean here, Lisa was.  OP just stated the truth.", "Or more like mom\u2019s 200-pound friend telling a 200-pound OP she needs to lose weight and OP saying \u201cWe both weigh 200 pounds.\u201d", "You are confusing this with OP being justified. Sometimes it is justified to be mean to someone.", "It still wouldn't be nice. But sometimes, it's OK to not be nice. I think a good portion of these aita scenarios wouldn't  happen if people were more comfortable with not being \"nice\".", "I have already said in that comment chain that it was justified to be mean. OP is obviously NTA. I just think pretending like she was saying some \"neutral fact\" is stupid, and that saying all facts are neutral is even more stupid.", "The friend's intent was to be mean. OP's intent was to give her a taste of her own medicine by being just as mean. OP easily could've just said something like \"why would you say something so unkind and judgemental?\", but chose to go the petty way. And good for OP to go the petty way. All justified, in case I haven't had repeated that enough times. But let's not pretend OP is some saint just stating neutral facts."]}
