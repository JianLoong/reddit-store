These were all things that if taken individually could be ignored or laughed off due to the absurdity, but it was cumulative, and no one had my back. There were times when I attempted to defend myself, and my family would accuse me of being a bully while my SIL smirked at me from behind their backs.

You're doing good.", "NTA Sounds like mom doesn\u2019t have many friends. Otherwise Lisa should have been asked to stop degrading her daughter.  There is nothing wrong with graduating at 24 or any other age.  And the fact your mother\u2019s friend, and I use that term loosely, moved out at 18 is not impressive since she moved in with and for a boyfriend.  She didn\u2019t move out and work her rear end off, no, she moved in with someone and calls that better than you.  Good grief! OP, you have a goal.

You seem to have a good head on your shoulders!", "i started university at 23 graduated at 31. i am 36 and childless. i am happy with my choices. \nalso, having children isn\u2019t \u201cselfless\u201d. it\u2019s literally the most selfish thing one can do - to create a copy of yourself that you can mold to do all the things you couldn\u2019t accomplish yourself. and the state of the world is in, it\u2019s irresponsible beyond belief to have children. \nthis woman is a dumb insecure idiot who is jealous of you being young and free, not shackled to the responsibility of raising kids. \n\nyou\u2019re doing just fine.", "Don\u2019t be embarrassed about graduating a couple years later. Additionally, you had a super legitimate excuse for not graduating \u201con time.\u201d I smoked too much weed and like never studied or did homework and it took me four years longer because I was a piece of shit in my early twenties. I did end up graduating and (somehow) went to grad school and I even felt a bit of weirdness being around a bunch of 22 year olds as a 27 year old so I do get the insecurity.\n\nEdit - NTA, OP. Lisa\u2019s experience at her age is completely irrelevant to yours, and any rational person would look at the context of her statement and instantly understand it was nothing less than just blatantly derogatory.", "NTA! Good job giving it back to Lisa. Did your mom not think Lisa was putting you down? Lisa shouldn\u2019t dish it out if she can\u2019t take it. Sounds like you\u2019re better off than Lisa was at 22, good luck with school!", "NTA", "NTA It also sounds like Mom wont have your back if you need her to. Keep that in mind.", "NTA - As a mom I would never allow someone speak to my child like that; regardless of my child's age. The fact that this has been going on for an extended amount of time tells me your mom is the problem. She is letting this woman degrade and bully you and it needs to stop. I'm glad you stood up to her. She needs to keep her mouth shut.\n\nI was unmarried and pregnant with my second child. I ended up on bed rest and still managed to get my degree. I never used it as an excuse to mistreat anyone. I viewed it as a crap time in my life and what a struggle it was. It doesn't make me better then anyone. She uses it as an excuse.  It's a weird way of saying she's better then you by having kids at your age and not getting anywhere in her life.\n\nShe's jealous and old.

You merely corrected her comparison to more accurately reflect any parallels that exist between your lives.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird that she started comparisons at all. YOU are in a much better situation than she was at your age.  Congrats on continuing school. Great decision.", "Lisa has a classic case of because my life was harder than yours, you are lacking. I am not discounting Lisa's struggles, but it was because of her choices. I am now 62 years old, and was a single mother for many years struggling to put food on the table for my children with no child support because of my own mistakes on choosing a partner (although there are some things beyond our control, and sh\\*t happens). NOBODY should put you down and diminish you because you have not made the same mistakes they have or gone through the struggles they have. You are on an amazing path, and your own mother should have your back and not give flying f\\*ck what Lisa thinks", "You can poke a sleeping bear all you want, but eventually the bear wakes up.", "Umm, she\u2019s looking way worse than you.  She didn\u2019t have herself together and brought two kids into the mess she wasn\u2019t prepared for.  Tell your mom that the woman needs to look herself in the mirror and admit her failings and stop being a judgmental  AH, or she needs to accept all the calling out that you and life and everyone she insults throws at her.

No Biggie, to be honest I'm glad I'll finish a bit later. Feel a bit more mature entering \"adulthood\" lol", "NTA. People who dish it can rarely ever take it. You\u2019re right, there was nothing insulting about it when Lisa was saying it all to you so it should go both ways.

You merely corrected her comparison to more accurately reflect any parallels that exist between your lives.", "This woman is out here bragging about how she was a mother at such a young age. Being a mother at 16 isn't something to brag about. You're still a child yourself at that age.

It is interesting that you appear to be attacking me.\n\nMaybe you thought you were directing your comment to someone else?", "NTA... you are working towards your goals. You are not staying home to play video games and avoid becoming an adult. It does not matter if you take a few extra years to get a good launch. I'd hate to see you add children to the mix. If you want children  that can wait till you are comfortable with your path. Good luck to you.", "NTA but your Mum and her friend are.

However, if your mom wants you to be kinder to Lisa, do it. When Lisa does it again politely ask her to stop making comparisons.

Also you shouldn't feel bad about graduating at 24! No one cares (in a good way) about how old you are in college, and classes are more diverse in age/life stage than you think. Plenty of people take gap years or take more time to graduate for a variety of reasons. That is nothing to be embarrassed about.\n\nLisa's weirdly insecure herself if she feels like she needs to level with you, at half her age. Being a mother at 22 isn't the flex she thinks it is.

Instead of taking it, you saw what you could and couldn't change about the situation, and made choices based on it.", "I can think of 100 different ways those same facts could have been used an insult. OP didn't do that, she turned a phrase, using the same words Lisa did, but Lisa knew the context and took it as an insult. That's on Lisa. NTA", "Given that she was barely an adult when she got pregnant, she probably got with the first ~~man~~ boy that came along. It's also telling they broke up shortly after having had the kids. I'm not sure if that counts as an accomplishment, sounds more like a fkup.\n\nYou go OP!", "Barely an adult? She was 16! What an accomplishment, becoming a single mother at 16 and then trying to tout that as making her superior."]}
