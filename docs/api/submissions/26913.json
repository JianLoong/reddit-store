We have 2 kids together (8 & 5) and she has a 19-year-old daughter (Jen) from a previous relationship.  Obviously, I have been in my stepdaughter's life for a long time and I view her and love her as my own daughter.  Her bio dad is still active in her life, but throughout high school she lived primarily with us because we live in a better school district.  She graduated this past spring and was supposed to start college this fall.\n\nI say \"supposed to\" because she never went.  Her BF of 3 years broke up with her this summer because they were attending different colleges and he didn't think it would work out.  He ended things 2 weeks before Jen was supposed to leave.  Jen was heartbroken and pretty much didn't leave her room for a week.  Both my wife and I tried to talk with her and encourage her to see this as an opportunity for personal growth while at college.  But all Jen did was dwell on the negative and sulk.  \n\nThen, Jen started saying that she didn't want to go to college because she was depressed.  We had numerous talks with her about this and encouraged her to go and to view it as an opportunity and a springboard to a new life.  However, none of our encouragement got through to her.  Without our knowledge, she contacted the school to cancel her enrollment and left to her dad's.  Before she left, she sent my wife a text telling her that our lack of support during this time proved to her that we don't have her best interests in mind and that she will be blocking us and told us not to try and contact her. \n\nOf course, this left my wife heartbroken because she didn't know what we did wrong.  This all came as a shock.  For me though, I was pissed.  We had already taken out parent plus loans to help Jen financially and are on the hook for that money.  I also got Jen a newer car and a credit card (both in my name) this summer for her to use at college.  She is also still on our family cell phone plan.  \n\nAfter Jen had been gone a couple days, I decided to check the credit card statement, she was using it and had racked up almost $1,000.  I immediately cancelled the card.   I then talked with my wife and told her that if Jen wants nothing to do with us, then I don't feel comfortable continuing to pay for things for her, like the car and cell phone.  My wife agreed and we contacted Jen's bio dad to talk with him.  \n\nHe said Jen only stayed with him a few nights before leaving one day and not coming back.  She texted him that she's staying with friends and was safe. I told my wife I am considering reporting the car stolen because it's registered in my name and I'm the one making payments for it.  But my wife thinks that would be an AH move and she already thinks me cancelling the credit card was a bad idea.\n\nI told her that Jen is trying to have things both ways.  She wants nothing to do with us, but also has no problem taking full advantage of the things we provided for her.

Damn what a hard situation to be in, and what a dumb move on your stepdaughter's part... If she refuses to keep contact with you, you obviously can't enable her life by providing money. I mean, you don't even know where she is! Cancelling the card is the right step to take, for sure. \n\nWith regards to the car, I'd take an extra step before going nuclear. A crime like this could stick to her record for life, and make things much much harder in the future. So, no matter how dumb she's being, it's normal that your wife is hesitant. I would contact her dad (since he seems to have contact with her) and tell him to let her know she has X days to get the car back to your place, since it's in your name and paid by your own money. And that if she doesn't do it, you'll be forced to contact the police.\n\nThen the ball is in her field. If she continues to make terrible choices, you need to take drastic measures. Being out there with access to a car and unlimited money is not good for her mental health anyway, and she'll eventually run into trouble.", "NTA to this point.\n\nYour cancelling of the credit card was appropriate. What you should first do though, is attempt to contact Jen by texting her directly and ask if her father would also contact her, to state that you want the car returned BEFORE you report it stolen.\n\nIf she has obviously received the message and then refuses to return the car, that's when you can proceed to next steps.", "NTA.\n\nSince she cancelled her enrollment in college, your first order of business should be pursuing at least a partial refund against the parent plus loans.\n\nSecond should be trying to contact her via cell phone, text, and email. Something to the effect of, \"The car is in my name. I got it so that you could attend college. You need to return it to me within two days or I will report it to the police as stolen\" seems reasonable enough.\n\nHowever, actually going through with that is something you need to get your wife to agree to. Getting her daughter arrested isn't something you should do without her consent.", "NTA.\n\nJen is in a rough spot -- first or early breakups are *hard*, especially when you have so little experience to rely on. I think it's worth remembering that this is far more difficult for her than you might think. As adults, we're better equipped to handle strong emotions due to sheer experience (most of the time).\n\nThat said, Jen needs to learn that her inability to handle her emotions doesn't give her free reign to do whatever she wants. She's sabotaging her own future because she can't see that future. Unfortunately, whatever the solution is, it doesn't involve dragging you down with her.\n\nCancelling the credit card and retrieving the car are not just ways to protect your own finances, they may be a wake up call to Jen that she needs to get her shit sorted out.", "NTA: You don't get to go NC with someone but still milk them for money and all the privileges of being in contact regardless of the circumstances.  She made an adult decision now she has to deal with adult consequences.  That is life...", "NTA but try to warn her first.", "NTA. But don't call the cops. Find out where she is staying and take it back yourself. If anyone has an issue with it, that's on them.", "NTA, \n\nCheck with the loan company for the student loan.  As she canceled her enrolment the money should not be distributed as most loans go through the financial aid office.  \n\nGive her a time frame to get the car back to you. As for the car it is not a good situation when a 19-year-old is just crashing with friends and has a car.  Good chance others are driving it as well.  Does the car or the phone have tracking on it so you can find her location.  Find out her location and at the end of that time you can pay a repo company to pick up the car or if you have the extra keys, you can go pick it up yourself.  Just have the paperwork showing you are the rightful owner of the car.  \n\nGive her a time frame to get a job and keep a job or the phone will be cut off.  \n\nShe is 19 years old, not a child.  Breaking up with you first love is hard to do but she needs to work through it and get her life on track.", "NTA.  I\u2019m so getting down voted here.  Get bio dad to get a meeting set up, since she blocked you.  And warn her about the car and credit card.  Offer her the option of paying for the car.   Start a dialogue.  \n\n\nNow, let\u2019s stop with the crisis comments here.  She broke up with her boyfriend.  Yes, it hurts but life goes on.  And as a woman, letting some boy derail your life, is stupid!  That boy is going to college and building his life.  God only knows what she\u2019s doing!  Yeah, it hurts!  But sometimes you\u2019re the heartbreaker or heartbroken.  Sulk, cry and rail at the world!  But baby gurl, no man is worth stopping your growth.   You have parents who want pay for school, got you a car and a credit card!?!. Please!", "NTA but you would be the AH if you don\u2019t tell her before you report this all stolen. You can get her into some serious trouble if she\u2019s gets pulled over in a stolen vehicle. Let her know what\u2019s going to happen instead of screwing her over with no warning. Credit card is reasonable, because that\u2019s actively costing you money, but no sense in sending her to jail bc she flew off the handle over a breakup", "NTA, for an adult Jen is acting like a toddler.  Any continued support should be contingent upon a psych eval.", "NTA you did support her and you did try to make her reason and do an adult choice, she didn\u2019t. She want make her choices then comes the consequences of those choices. \nI will cancel the card, phone and any other thing you paid for and inform her the car have to be returned by date xxx or it will be reported stolen (yes a grace period and a notice is deserved).", "So instead of reporting it stolen, when I ran away from home with \u201cmy\u201d car that my dad was paying for, he reported it as unauthorized user. But I know I might live in a different state. But they had no idea where I was and my dad paid for everything for me too. That was the only way they could try to find me.", "NTA. But don't report the car stolen just yet. Give your daughter an opportunity to return the car on her own. Let her know that you will be reporting it stolen after 2nd or 3rd reminder. If she wants to be an adult then she has to face the adult consequences.", "NTA for not wanting to support her any more. Just know that if you report the car stolen, your SD will end up with a criminal record with a felony charge.  I think the smarter thing to do would be to contact her and tell her she has XX days to return the car and that if she doesn't you will report it as stolen.  As it stands right now, she left with the vehicle with your permission.", "NTA -Your step daughter is 19. It appears y\u2019all have become a scapegoat for her ex BF. She can\u2019t lash out at her ex so she is lashing out at y\u2019all  \n\nCancelling the credit card that she is using is the right thing to do\u2026.$1,000 is a lot.  Reporting the car stolen, might be going too far-but I would do it. The credit card & car were to be used at college which she is not going to. Plus you took out loans for her education. That\u2019s a huge financial investment for your family. \n\nHopefully she snaps out of it, but you need to protect yourselves financially.", "NTA Report the car stolen, disconnect her phone, demand the refund from the school for any money spent out of the loan, take her to small claims court for the money you're out so far including the credit card bill and get a legal judgment against her. She wants to be petty and childish and go off the rails after a heartbreak, let her know she's not taking you with her.", "NTA - but the last thing you want to do is report the car stolen and have her get arrested.  She is struggling and this would be counter-productive to her future opportunities.  The same ones that you used to persuade her to go to college.  This would make you a hypocritical AH.  \n\nInstead of reporting the car stolen, file a missing persons report.  She's lost right now and just needs to find a way to get her feet on the ground again.  Don't tell her what she has to do.  Just listen to what she has to say and how she feels and show her that you DO support her.  Right now she probably feels lost and that the world is out to get her and no one cares.  You obviously do so please do the right thing.", "Of course she\u2019s depressed. Losing a relationship like that sucks. No amount of encouragement is going to cut through that! Jen is right: you and your wife were not supportive. You failed to acknowledge and validate her emotions, expecting her to see a silver lining and magically be happy again.\nCancelling the credit card, reasonable move. Reporting the car as stolen, not. As others have suggested, a criminal record is not how you set your child up for success.\n\nThat said, I get why you want to go nuclear. Jen essentially did. She canceled college, leaving you in debt with nothing to show for it. She blocked you yet continued using your money and car. That sounds like it hurt, and it\u2019s human to want to cause hurt back. \n\nYou would be TA for reporting the car as stolen. I was going to say E S H, but as I typed why, I ended up in YTA camp. You and your wife essentially told Jen to get over a major heartbreak instead of being a safe space for her to process this pain. Sure, Jen cancelling college, leaving you in debt, blocking you, and racking up more debt was wrong. She wouldn\u2019t be in the position where she felt the need to do that if you had allowed her to process and heal from her pain instead of pushing her to ignore it and focus on the positive. Given the pain she\u2019s in from her ex, and the extra pain from parents who lacked the emotional intelligence to support her, I don\u2019t expect her to be making the best decisions right now. \n\nI have one important question. She said you don\u2019t have her best interests in mind \u2014 is this an accusation that she\u2019s made before? I feel like that\u2019s an odd association to make in this situation, absent previous issues. \n\nFinally, please consider seeing a therapist. You and your wife could stand to develop your emotional intelligence so the next time Jen needs support, you have the tools to be there for her.\nJen needs support now, and while you and your wife may not presently have the knowledge needed to provide that, a therapist will.", "Not the ah. She needs to grow up and accept responsibility. If she\u2019s not willing to go to college she needs to get a job and stop relying on you financially. She may wake up if you repo the car.", "NTA. If she wants nothing to do with you she doesn't need what you've provided. Your wife is out of line expecting you to continue to provide to her adult daughter, who has cut contact with you.\n\nText her and tell her to return the car or it'll be reported stolen and that she needs to make other arrangements for phone service. If she has already blocked you, ask her bio dad to pass on the message. Then cancel her phone and report the car as stolen.\n\nDid you give Jen cash from the parent plus loans? If you have the money in your account you should be able to repay the loan.", "NTA", "ESH. She's not acting rationally. She told you she was depressed and you just kept pushing her to leave. From your perspective you were supporting her for the future, but she needed your support now. She is not okay and all you wanted to do was push her to solve a future problem.", "NTA. But also people need to stop pressuring their kids into going to college. It isn't for everyone, and pressure makes people act out.", "ESH. When your daughter is not leaving her room for a week and telling you she\u2019s depressed, the appropriate response is to get her professional help, not belittle her feelings by telling her she should see the good in it and view it as a new opportunity. She\u2019s clearly struggling and she needed support that she didn\u2019t get from you. You\u2019re not wrong for cancelling the credit card though. She was given the credit card and car to help her during college but if she\u2019s not in college she doesn\u2019t need and shouldn\u2019t have those things. She can\u2019t cut off contact with you and expect to still get those from you, so you went through the appropriate channels to stop her from using those when she refused to come home or communicate like an adult.", "NTA\n\nBut her reaction does seem extreme. Has she ever shown signs of depression or acted dramatic about things before? \n\nEither way, give her a chance to bring the car back before getting the police involved. Filing a report against her will have long term repercussions. She already dug herself into a hole unenrolling from college and racking up a $1,000+ credit card. Give her a chance to listen to reason. Cancelling the card and her phone and retrieving the car may be harsh, but it sounds like she needs some tough love right now. And you need to protect your own finances. And if Jen wants to pull the \"I'm an adult now\" card? Well, guess what? She IS an adult. And if she wants to be an adult, that means she can deal with adult realities; paying her own phone bill, finding a place to live and transportation, etc. She can also deal with adult consequences, such as having a police report filed against her.", "An adult told you they were too depressed to handle college.\n\nInstead of believing them, you tripled down.\n\nThat was dumb. That was the asshole move.\n\nYou are right to cancel the card and phone if you wish. But you aren't owed anything on those.\n\nThe car is NOT stolen. You need to involve a lawyer.", "Nta for canceling the card. \n\nYta if you just report the car stolen.  \n\nNo money is one thing. But giving her a police record is really fucked up.  Stealing a car is a felony.", "NTA\n\nAs others said, make every attempt to reach out to warn her about the car and give her at least a few weeks, if not a month. This is the nuclear option and could result in her catching a felony if it spirals. That being said, no she shouldn't keep it all considering.\n\nFor your parent plus loans, you should be able to pay off that money right away. Hopefully you'll only be on the hook for interest.\n\nSorry about your daughter. Hopefully this is only a large bump in the road and not a sign of who she's going to be as an independent adult.", "NTA.\n\nThere's something seriously wrong with your daughter-in-law. She's being extremely self-destructive. An intervention is required before she ends up a homeless junkie.\n\nDon't report the car as stolen without a warning first.", "Nta, but I wouldn't report the car as stolen. Although you've made a mistake by not signing it over to her sooner because now anything that she does while its in her possession will come back to you as the legal owner and Insurance holder.", ">We had already taken out parent plus loans to help Jen financially and are on the hook for that money.\n\nIf she never went to school you get most of that back and can pay off the loan immediately. So what is your concern here? Why is this a major issue?\n\nWhy are you guys not concerned that your 19yo is seemingly going through a MAJOR crisis? Totally withdrawing from family this way, especially without any income, stable housing or apparent plan or goal, is not normal. Where's the concern that she may hurt herself or engage in destructive behaviors?\n\nWhere's the concern that without a credit card or cellphone she has no way to get home safely? Or out of a dangerous situation?\n\nYTA", "Encouraging her is not the same thing as validating and holding space for her feelings, and asking what she wants, to help her figure that out. \n\nShe is lost right now, she needs emotional support, she couldn't get it from you so she left. Stop focusing on the money and love your daughter. She is being a 19 year old. Its your job to be someone she can count on no matter how much she fucks up.", "NTA\n\nShe is being entitled, overly dramatic, and spoiled.\n\nToo depressed for college, not depressed when spending your money.\n\nPoor princess \ud83d\ude22", "Yes, report the car stolen so your stepdaughter gets arrested for felony theft. Amazing parenting skills. That\u2019ll show her!\n\nYTA.", "your child has blocked you out of her life and left your home and your concerned about the material things?  literally what is wrong with you.  the last thing she needs is MORE lack of support.  she already expressed to you that you didn't support her during a tough time, taking away her car might put her into a situation she can't get out of.  she might have used the credit card for necessities, have you thought of that? \n\nshe was depressed enough to stay in her room for a week and all you could do was talk to her about school.  no wonder she left.  she wasn't dwelling on the negative, she was grieving a loss.  do you even have a soul?  \n\nhow dare you call her your daughter.  also, your wife needs to grow a backbone and not follow your lead and ignore her own instincts when it comes to her daughter.  YTA.", "YTA. For starts, you will have a hard time filing a police report after they find out you willingly gave the keys to your step-daughter and she has been using the car for months. Second, potentially giving her a criminal record because there is a familial spat happening is pretty petty. \n\nYes she is legally an adult but at 19 we are still dumb and our brains aren\u2019t fully developed. You said she feels depressed, has anybody suggested therapy? Hell it sounds like some family sessions would be beneficial. \n\nAt 19 she still needs parental guidance IMHO. If you report the car stolen you\u2019ll likely be damaging the relationship and making it harder for her to come back home for guidance and support. She is in a transitional period, give it a couple more months and focus on improving the relationship. She might need some space right now and how you respond is going to set the stage for the next several years if this relationship.", "YTA if you don\u2019t at least ask for the car back before reporting it stolen. That kind of criminal record can be life ruining, and from her vantage point it was a gift. \n\nAlso you can get a refund on the cost of tuition, etc and use that refund to pay the loans back.", "Ywbta.\n\nYou can't report a car as stolen when it is not in fact stolen. That's called making a false police report. That is a crime. \n\n If the police are remotely competent they are going to ask you questions when you tell them the car is stolen. Questions like \"how did she get the car\" \"when was she supposed to return it\"  or \" has she refused to return it\". Based on what you've written here, she had permission to use/keep the car and has no idea you are revoking the permission. That's not theft. You may not get into trouble if the police and prosecutor's office view your report as a misunderstanding of the law rather than a deliberate lie to get her in trouble. That should not be a gamble you want to take.\n\nYou certainly aren't an asshole for being disappointed and angry and feeling taken advantage of. Cancelling the credit card makes sense. You have every right to demand the car back by a certain date (assuming your name is on the title). But making a police report that would at best do nothing or at worst get yourself in trouble is really foolish.\n\nSource: I am a prosecutor.", "Yta.\nDon't report something as stolen when it wasn't. You don't need the car. You just want to revoke her independence because she's using it. Stop. Think. What is best for your daughter?", "ESH.  First, you reporting the car as stolen is absolutely an AH move, since it isn't stolen.  Also, it does seem like you weren't emotionally supporting her during a tough time.  However, she shouldn't be spending money of yours without permission.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't consider her using a car that was bought for her stealing, since (I assume) she was never told that the car she was given could not be used by her anymore.  I know it is legally in his name, but this isn't about legal problems.", "ESH. Your stepdaughter is one AH for going no contact and running up credit card charges. Assuming you are giving us the whole story, it sounds like she really needs a psychiatric evaluation and therapy to work through her feelings, learn how to cope in a healthy manner, and reconcile with you and her mother. But she is also a legal adult, and you can not compel her to do that or to go to college.\n\nYou are the other AH. Not for cutting her off financially, but for wanting to lie to police about the car being stolen. A felony arrest for grand theft auto can derail whatever future she hopes to have - getting her fired from a job or denied future admission to the college - at least until it is cleared up at the expense of hiring a defense attorney. Do you really want to ruin her life over this? Also, it is a crime to file a false police report, so charges could be brought against you by the DA once they sort out what really happened.\n\nI understand that you feel hurt right now, but you need to pause for a beat and see if you can make contact with her. Try negotiating through her dad, since they're still talking. Ultimately, you would need to pursue a civil course of action to get the vehicle back. But really, you should only be focused on your stepdaughter's well-being right now. It sounds like she needs help.", "YWBTA if it's her name on the title and you report it as stolen. For one thing, you'll have her tossed in jail for at least one night with actual criminals. For another, you don't say anything about having asked her to return it. And for the kicker, if it's in her name you'll get yourself arrested for filing a false police report.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's in your name, you can request it back. Make sure that's documented. Because if it's in your name and you were only really letting her use it, it would be wrong for her to keep it.\n\nIt sounds like she's in a depressive spiral and could use help more than she could use revenge.", "NTA. But I wouldn't report the car stolen. Everything else is fair.\n\nINFO: Since she cancelled enrollment, you should still have the loan money and just pay it back, right?\n\nYour step daughter is making a huge mistake though. Not going to college over a *guy*. Hopefully she'll come to her senses and re-enroll soon.", "YTA if you report the car stolen. It\u2019s her car you gave it to her it isn\u2019t stolen you just don\u2019t agree with her actions. This isn\u2019t a police matter.

We have 2 kids together (8 & 5) and she has a 19-year-old daughter (Jen) from a previous relationship.  Obviously, I have been in my stepdaughter's life for a long time and I view her and love her as my own daughter.  Her bio dad is still active in her life, but throughout high school she lived primarily with us because we live in a better school district.  She graduated this past spring and was supposed to start college this fall.\n\nI say \"supposed to\" because she never went.  Her BF of 3 years broke up with her this summer because they were attending different colleges and he didn't think it would work out.  He ended things 2 weeks before Jen was supposed to leave.  Jen was heartbroken and pretty much didn't leave her room for a week.  Both my wife and I tried to talk with her and encourage her to see this as an opportunity for personal growth while at college.  But all Jen did was dwell on the negative and sulk.  \n\nThen, Jen started saying that she didn't want to go to college because she was depressed.  We had numerous talks with her about this and encouraged her to go and to view it as an opportunity and a springboard to a new life.  However, none of our encouragement got through to her.  Without our knowledge, she contacted the school to cancel her enrollment and left to her dad's.  Before she left, she sent my wife a text telling her that our lack of support during this time proved to her that we don't have her best interests in mind and that she will be blocking us and told us not to try and contact her. \n\nOf course, this left my wife heartbroken because she didn't know what we did wrong.  This all came as a shock.  For me though, I was pissed.  We had already taken out parent plus loans to help Jen financially and are on the hook for that money.  I also got Jen a newer car and a credit card (both in my name) this summer for her to use at college.  She is also still on our family cell phone plan.  \n\nAfter Jen had been gone a couple days, I decided to check the credit card statement, she was using it and had racked up almost $1,000.  I immediately cancelled the card.   I then talked with my wife and told her that if Jen wants nothing to do with us, then I don't feel comfortable continuing to pay for things for her, like the car and cell phone.  My wife agreed and we contacted Jen's bio dad to talk with him.  \n\nHe said Jen only stayed with him a few nights before leaving one day and not coming back.  She texted him that she's staying with friends and was safe. I told my wife I am considering reporting the car stolen because it's registered in my name and I'm the one making payments for it.  But my wife thinks that would be an AH move and she already thinks me cancelling the credit card was a bad idea.\n\nI told her that Jen is trying to have things both ways.  She wants nothing to do with us, but also has no problem taking full advantage of the things we provided for her. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP has to protect himself.", "You say that like they know where she is staying", "The line \"But all Jen did was sulk\" tells a lot about the father's lack of detail in regards to the conversations, and \"encouragement\". Yes, Jen shouldn't have used the CC - but going as far to try and get her charged? Come off it. Really prove her point. \n\nA lot of privileged older guys who have the means to fortunately support their kids like this, don't see that the toxic shitty behaviors that got them there, are toxic shitty behaviors. You genuinely think those conversations were as cordial as he's representing? I highly doubt it. There's information missing here that OP is obviously committing", "Possession does not magically become theft because OP changes their mind.\n\nLike u/Last_Day1997 mentioned, disagreement over whether or not she's entitled to keep the car is a civil matter, not a criminal one.", "At least in California, the law prohibiting auto theft requires proving that the alleged perpetrator took the vehicle without the owner's consent.\n\nIn this case, OP's stepdaughter had his consent at the time she took the vehicle. If he changes his mind, that's a civil matter, not a criminal one.", "Your point being?\n\n\"Mr. Policeman!! That car is mine. Make her give it back.\"\n\n\"How did she get the keys?\"\n\n\"I gave them to her. But now I want it back.\"\n\n\"Then sue her. This is a civil matter.\"\n\nHis credit card company is going to tell him the same thing if he tries to reverse the charges she made. She was an authorized user. She made purchases. He's responsible for paying the cost. If he wants her to pay him back, he'll have to sue her in small claims court.", "I would do that first.  Honestly it sounds like she is having a mental breakdown and is in a pretty downward spiral.  I mean in a couple of weeks she has dropped out of college, cut off contact with family,  and is probably effectively homeless living off of friends couches\u2026\n\nI would have a talk with wife and bio dad, this seems pretty serious and there\u2019s several mental health disorders that pop up right now.\n\nINFO:  how was she before the break up? Was she normal? Did she seem maniac?  I asked because bipolar disorder pops up around now, and people with it can go from very happy(but destructive) to incredibly self destructive and depressed very quxikly", "Have a friend call the number or get a new phone number(Google has an app for setting up quick phone numbers).  Emails can also be setup so you can see if someone\u2019s viewed something", "The sarcasm here is really telling too.. Grow up, guy.", "We haven't cancelled her phone yet.  My wife is holding out hope that Jen will respond to one of the many texts she sends every day, or answers one of the calls she makes every night.  The phone is our best chance to get in touch with her.", "She blocked them and took off gor parts unknown. At that point she can't expect support from them.", "He said he doesn't want to pay for her cell phone or car any more. He didn't say he'd cancelled her cell plan, only the CC.", "At what point would you consider it concerning? How do you differentiate a temper tantrum from a situation with serious risk of self-harm?", "She's an adult not 3. She didn't do anything wrong by deciding she wasn't ready for college.", "Possible, but there's no evidence of that. And that wouldn't be real stable or healthy behavior on her part.", "Legally, yes, but if you were given a car as a gift, you would expect to be able to use it, therefore using it is not stealing.  He can tell her to give it back since she isn't going to college, but straight up reporting a car that wasn't stolen as stolen is an AH move.", "She's having some kind of mental breakdown. I'd expect a parent whose child is going through that to put in more of an effort to track her down than simply turning her in for an alleged car theft. Say, by coordinating with her bio dad.\n\nApparently reddit isn't particularly forgiving. A whole bunch of NTAs. I'd be more worried about my daughter's safety than my own wounded pride or a car.", "No, it's not in her name. Legally, the car is OPs... so if she doesn't return it... then it's theft", "Every resting dad face guy on this thread is never gonna believe it.", "We don't know where they are; step had consent to use car at home and in college town. She went to her dad's without knowledge or consent, cut contact and took off with car to parts unknown.\n\nIf she remained in contact and told them where she was going, you'd have an argument. The fact she cut contact and they no longer know her location says theft.", "Thats not in anyway shape or form how the law works\n\n\n\u201cDoes she have your consent to use your car?\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it back or put your hand behind your back\u201d", "Oh, my mistake on that then. Sorry, will edit the comment.", "Have other friends call her, she can\u2019t block numbers she doesn\u2019t know", "At what point do you stop making everything trauma and crisis. 19 year old takes it upon herself to disrupt everyone else\u2019s life with out communicating at all. What are they supposed to do?  Hunt her down and throw her into a clinic against her will because a kid dumped her? Lol", "Exactly. Just proved my point. She\u2019s an adult so she can get herself her own car in her own credit card.", "There's no evidence of real stable or healthy behavior on her part tho.", "If you were being lent a car for use in a specific situation, and then you take the car and disappear... that's not the situation you were lent the car for. \n\nShe has blocked them and disappeared, how do you think he is going to get his property back?", "> if you were given a car as a gift\n\nBut it's not a gift if it was given for a specific circumstance and ownership remained with the giver.", "For sure what will make a teenager think highly of her parents is them helping give her a criminal record when she told them she's going through a mental health crisis.", "The mum texts and calls many times a day, and gets no response. The daughter has told no one where she is, except to say she's staying with a friend. \n\nI would be more worried about my child's safety too. But that doesn't change that you're suggesting they do the impossible.", "Maybe, depending on where OP lives. In California, for it to qualify as auto theft requires proving that the daughter did not have OP's consent to take the vehicle. Since she plainly did have his consent at the time, him changing his mind after the fact is irrelevant. From a legal perspective, she did not steal the car.\n\nIf he wants it back, that's a civil matter, not a criminal one.", "LOL. That's demonstrably true.", "If I was seeing directly manipulative behavior from the daughter. If she was in contact and making her return contingent on demands, if she was guilting the parents (any set of parents), if she was clearly in a physically safe and stable situation (eg at her bio-dad's house) but still wanted to use OP's credit card and car.\n\nAny of those things would say to me it's not a crisis and she's just being a brat. But none of those things are happening.\n\nHow about you answer my questions now.", "She could, that doesn't change the gift nature of use of the card and car, which isn't stolen. \n\nYou probably identify with the op because you tried to control your adult children and were disappointed.", "What's your point?", "Did they tell her it was conditional on her going to college?\n\nIt\u2019s not worth sticking her with a felony before you go through the trouble of asking for the car back.\n\nThey can talk to her dad.", "I highly doubt California law works in a way where they can have the car Indefinitly because you let them drive it to work for a day. Or got the car to drive to college and then drove to join the circus. If you can find a case where someone won that lawsuit show it. But until then... You're more than likely misinterpreting how the law is enforced.", "I already answered your question there are no signs of crisis. She\u2019s being a brat. We obviously disagreed and that\u2019s OK.", "Cutting contact with her mom and OP, taking off for parts unknown with their car is stealing it. They provided the car for her to use at the college she was enrolled in, she canceled her enrollment and took off.", "You keep saying multiple times that the car isn't stolen.  Are you a lawyer?  Everything for the car is in my name.  Jen's name is not on any paperwork related to the car.  It is registered to me.  The title is in my name only.  The car is mine that we allowed Jen to use for college.  It's not Jen's car, it's mine.  She took it and we don't know where it is.

Lol", "There is absolutely not gift nature of the credit card, this is the most ridiculous thing ever, even the car came with the president attachment promise of attending college.  Like an engagement ring come with a promise which if broken must be returned. Also who the f gift credit cards?", "Read your comment above", "\"I also got Jen a newer car and a credit card (both in my name) this summer for her to use at college.\"\n\nI don't know if they told her it was conditional. But the post definitely suggests that they did.", "That's not an answer that's just you stating your opinion again. I asked HOW you differentiate a temper tantrum from a reason for concern. As in, what signs, behaviors, or choices make you think she's being a brat?\n\nWhy do you think she's acting out for attention when she cut contact - which is the opposite of engaging for attention?", "She violated the terms of a verbal civil agreement for the gift of use of a car. \n\nThat's not car theft.", "Did you tell her that it was a loaner while she was in college? I'm just curious. I've been saying it counts as stolen, so I'm not fighting you!", "I'm not suggesting you are not entitled to the (eventual) return of the car. Merely that no crime is committed and it's a civil matter.\n\nYou will need to follow civil law. If you're weren't so clumsy and bombastic as you make yourself out to be you could have already figure out how to do that in your state.", "I know what my comment says. I'm not clear on what you're trying to get across with that reply.\n\nIf the daughter really doesn't have a history of stable or healthy behavior throughout her teens, that's even more reason for concern. And going to her BF's college town wouldn't lessen that concern.", "I just think it\u2019s worth it to contact her dad and tell him they want the car back and will report it stolen if she doesn\u2019t return it, because a felony can ruin your life and from her view she might just think this is a car for her use.\n\nIn my state, it would be up to 10 years in prison.", "Temper tantrum is defined by what this kid is doing. Need more help?", "Taking it to parts unknown, telling them not to contact her and she's blocking them make it theft; she clearly had no plans to either return it to them or let them know where it is.", "You are all over here saying it was a gift. It was not a gift. To gift someone a car you title the car in their name. This car was to be used with conditions that the daughter no longer is meeting. It was taken without permission since it is not being used for the purpose of college. \n\nShe was not given a car she was allowed to use OPs car and there is a huge difference. All parking tickets or towing charges she gets during her mental health crisis are now on OP and not the daughter. If you have a car that is not titled to you permission can be revoked at any time by the owner unless there is a contract in writing stating otherwise.", "My wife and I made it very clear to her that this is NOT her car.  This is a car that I am buying and allowing her to use at college.  I am paying for it.  I am paying for insurance.  It is registered and titled in my name.  We told her she is only responsible for gas and oil changes.  She knows it is not her car.", "So......you're not a lawyer you just like sounding like one on the internet.", "OP responded\n\n>My wife and I made it very clear to her that this is NOT her car.
