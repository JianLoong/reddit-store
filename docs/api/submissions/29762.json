It's already tacky not to inform invited guests beforehand that they need to contribute to a meal financially. Even tackier to then buy expensive food without confirming that all guests can afford to pay for the meal. And then they're asking you to pay half the money *without even giving you half the food?* That's not even tacky anymore, that's just rude and greedy.\n\nMaybe I'm sensitive, but such a thing would make me reevaluate the friendship. At the very least, my friend and I would need to have a talk about that - and I'd probably not attend anything they host in the future.", "YWNBTA. You were invited over, it wasn\u2019t discussed before or when they ordered, and you weren\u2019t offered leftovers. Having said that, it may not be a hill worth dying on. You could certainly offer to cover a portion you feel reasonable given they kept all the leftovers and if they had more, etc, and I even think it\u2019s fair to say you wished it was communicated, didn\u2019t expect to pay etc and never go there again. I do think just straight up refusing to pay may start something that may not be worth the trouble, but if you feel it is then you wouldn\u2019t be TA for not paying and explaining why.", "NTA. Tell him that as you were invited, you didn't expect to receive a bill at the end. You didn't force him to order in and, by the sound of it, neither decided on what to order nor how much to get. I presume the leftovers stayed with him? Doesn't sound fair to make you pay for that!", "Are we talkin USD? lol how big is his family? Like did he buy every item on the menu?\n\nFirst he's to lazy to host properly then he stiffs you with the bill. Sounds like you are being played and he just wanted to order on your expense.\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA.  This isn't the first time I've heard someone do this.  You were invited and they opted not to cook. I wouldn't pay either.", "Ywnbta they invited you to their home for dinner and they chose not to cook\u2026take away bill is on them.
