Regardless of your reasons, it is perfectly acceptable to not want someone you don't know to come into your home. If its important to her that her boyfriend comes then maybe suggest she host instead of you.", "NAH. This is a tough one and personally,  I think you are overly concerned about your home's appearance and you are killing the party.  If your home is in good enough shape to host your friends, who you care about,  then it's in good enough shape to include your friend's boyfriend,  whose opinion shouldn't be as important and who will likely sympathize with construction zone mess.  Still, your house,  your comfort zone, limiting who you choose to invited into your home is rarely AH behavior.", "NTA, your home, your rules. I completely understand your anxiety. I work myself up into a state letting people into my home if I can\u2019t make it at least presentable. Which I am having a hard time doing at the moment. The judgment I feel radiating off a newcomer is more than I can stand.", "NTA.\n\nYou have understandable reasons and it\u2018s your home. It would be different if her boyfriend had been introduced to you and become a friend before.", "NAH\n\nI also have certain people who can see my house in a state that others can not. I totally get it. But Emma is allowed to feel how she feels and go somewhere else with her boyfriend to watch.", "NAH. \n\nI can\u2019t believe all the people calling you an AH. Everyone is different. Some people are house proud and others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being one or the other.\n\nOP is definitely house proud and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone who\u2019ll see it for the first time like that. While that might be difficult for her friend Sarah to understand and she\u2019s making her decision to not come, OP is well within her right to do what she is comfortable doing in her own house.\n\nAdditionally, I can imagine that with construction there may be other issues. And people who care about how they host may not want to host people if they feel they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. I\u2019m chill but my husband is like that - when people come over, he has to prep a multi course meal and make sure people are well fed. I on the other hand might just order food. That doesn\u2019t make either of us AHs. It\u2019s just about what your comfortable and OP is drawing her boundaries which is totally fine.", "NTA. I get your reasoning", "Going with NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable not wanting to have a stranger over while your home is in renovation chaos, and it\u2019s not wrong for wanting to put your best foot forward. If Emma doesn\u2019t want to come, that is her prerogative.", "NTA \n\nIt's your home. You are well within your rights to dictate who does or does not visit. \nI can understand why your friend is a bit put out that her BF can't tag along, but she should respect your decision", "Nta. The YTAs here are ridiculous. Some people don't like having strangers invited to their house. If this was a woman nobody would be saying anything against them.", "NTA. I completely understand where you are coming from. My parents remodeled their home and we're the same way.  Either way your home your choice.", "Nah but if you continue to exclude the bf you might be down a friend", "NTA she barely started dating and your not comfortable with someone you haven't met come to your house.", "NTA inviting into your home a SO of a six year relationship who has fully integrated into the friend circle is not comparable to a SO of maybe a month and a half that no one has met yet. There's a time a place for introducing a stranger to your friends, and a friend's house that's undergoing some renovation doesn't seem like the best option.", "YTA. This complex algorithm that decides who can and can't see your house sounds exhausting and confusing. Either have people over or don't.", "NTA I have been in a similar situation with a kitchen remodel. It was right in the center of the house and you couldn\u2019t get to either sitting/tv room without seeing it or walking through it (big plastic sheets over the doors). I wouldn\u2019t let anyone in my house that I wouldn\u2019t trust to keep my darkest secrets. People are judgmental! And I\u2019m glad to know I\u2019m not the only person with this thought process! There\u2019s at least 2 of us!", "Nta, I don't know if you fully explained your reasoning , and if you didn't then you really should. But being a construction zone and a potential safety hazard it is just good judgment to not let strangers into your house.  Could be an easy lawsuit if the wanted to get destructive and have an easy payday", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "YTA. This is a classic AITA case of 'I technically have the legal right to do X, therefore I can'. You have alienated one of your friends as a result, and it could easily cause lasting damage to your friendship, and for what? I mean, even as someone who has struggled with social anxiety myself, I don't really understand why you couldn't just have Emma tell her boyfriend ahead of time that your house is undergoing repairs and to not worry about the mess.", "NAH. Honestly, I think your excuse is kinda weird but I wouldn\u2019t have people over while remodeling because of the potential safety hazard. That goes double for people I hardly know. In fact, you should probably just consider going to a sports bar/restaurant and catching the game there with your friends. \u201cConstruction site\u201d doesn\u2019t sound super safe. At the end of the day though it\u2019s your house and you don\u2019t have to have someone you\u2019re uncomfortable with there.\n\nEmma\u2019s feelings make a lot of sense here. Your excuse is silly (how do you know if her boyfriend is judgmental or not?), and she\u2019s justified in asking if she can bring her boyfriend along. Sarah and Chris are also a couple, which is most likely why this not being \u201cokay\u201d with you was unexpected. She\u2019s also totally justified in not wanting to go, and watching the World Cup with her boyfriend.", "YTA. If the only reason you're saying this is really just.. oh my house is a work in progress, get over yourself. Yes, your house your roles but that doesnt' mean your roels don't make you an AH.", "YTA. i don't get why you care what some stranger thinks of your home. And if it's an acceptable reason for the mess, then fine. it's not as if you're deliberately being a slob.", "YTA While it might be 100% accurate that your reasons are exactly as stated, it comes off as your reasons being some thing else and petty. Basically no one\u2019s going to believe that. So now it just looks like you\u2019re trying to exclude this poor guy on purpose and what has he done to you to be shunned like this?", "Light YTA. Of course you\u2019re not obligated to have anyone in your home you\u2019re not comfortable hosting. But I think you\u2019re losing sight of the forest through the trees. \n\nIn trying not to be perceived as messy by one stranger, you\u2019re causing yourself to be perceived as an asshole by your close friends, and that same stranger. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable hosting with your house in its current state, don\u2019t. If you do, then let go of the obsessive worry about how your one friend\u2019s new boyfriend is going to perceive your home. If you\u2019d extended the invitation to him, I\u2019m sure all he would have perceived you as would be a nice inviting guy who\u2019s inviting him over despite construction. Instead, you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s alienating his GF (your good friend) over a soccer party invite, and now he probably is (understandably) judging.", "Technically NTA mostly because you haven't met him yet but, I personally don't see the big deal.", "Sure, technically you have every right to make the rules in your home. You were inhospitable to a benign request from someone you call friend. I don't see why you dug your heals in over one person but that is your choice. Enjoy being technically right and the AH for no reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
