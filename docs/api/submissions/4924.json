Regardless of your reasons, it is perfectly acceptable to not want someone you don't know to come into your home. If its important to her that her boyfriend comes then maybe suggest she host instead of you.", "NAH. This is a tough one and personally,  I think you are overly concerned about your home's appearance and you are killing the party.  If your home is in good enough shape to host your friends, who you care about,  then it's in good enough shape to include your friend's boyfriend,  whose opinion shouldn't be as important and who will likely sympathize with construction zone mess.  Still, your house,  your comfort zone, limiting who you choose to invited into your home is rarely AH behavior.", "NTA, your home, your rules. I completely understand your anxiety. I work myself up into a state letting people into my home if I can\u2019t make it at least presentable. Which I am having a hard time doing at the moment.

I totally get it. But Emma is allowed to feel how she feels and go somewhere else with her boyfriend to watch.", "NAH. \n\nI can\u2019t believe all the people calling you an AH. Everyone is different. Some people are house proud and others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being one or the other.\n\nOP is definitely house proud and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting someone who\u2019ll see it for the first time like that. While that might be difficult for her friend Sarah to understand and she\u2019s making her decision to not come, OP is well within her right to do what she is comfortable doing in her own house.\n\nAdditionally, I can imagine that with construction there may be other issues. And people who care about how they host may not want to host people if they feel they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. I\u2019m chill but my husband is like that - when people come over, he has to prep a multi course meal and make sure people are well fed. I on the other hand might just order food. That doesn\u2019t make either of us AHs. It\u2019s just about what your comfortable and OP is drawing her boundaries which is totally fine.", "NTA. I get your reasoning", "Going with NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable not wanting to have a stranger over while your home is in renovation chaos, and it\u2019s not wrong for wanting to put your best foot forward. If Emma doesn\u2019t want to come, that is her prerogative.", "NTA \n\nIt's your home. You are well within your rights to dictate who does or does not visit. \nI can understand why your friend is a bit put out that her BF can't tag along, but she should respect your decision", "Nta. The YTAs here are ridiculous. Some people don't like having strangers invited to their house. If this was a woman nobody would be saying anything against them.", "NTA. I completely understand where you are coming from. My parents remodeled their home and we're the same way.  Either way your home your choice.", "Nah but if you continue to exclude the bf you might be down a friend", "NTA she barely started dating and your not comfortable with someone you haven't met come to your house.", "NTA inviting into your home a SO of a six year relationship who has fully integrated into the friend circle is not comparable to a SO of maybe a month and a half that no one has met yet. There's a time a place for introducing a stranger to your friends, and a friend's house that's undergoing some renovation doesn't seem like the best option.", "YTA. This complex algorithm that decides who can and can't see your house sounds exhausting and confusing. Either have people over or don't.", "NTA I have been in a similar situation with a kitchen remodel. It was right in the center of the house and you couldn\u2019t get to either sitting/tv room without seeing it or walking through it (big plastic sheets over the doors). I wouldn\u2019t let anyone in my house that I wouldn\u2019t trust to keep my darkest secrets. People are judgmental! And I\u2019m glad to know I\u2019m not the only person with this thought process! There\u2019s at least 2 of us!", "Nta, I don't know if you fully explained your reasoning , and if you didn't then you really should.

Could be an easy lawsuit if the wanted to get destructive and have an easy payday", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "YTA. This is a classic AITA case of 'I technically have the legal right to do X, therefore I can'. You have alienated one of your friends as a result, and it could easily cause lasting damage to your friendship, and for what? I mean, even as someone who has struggled with social anxiety myself, I don't really understand why you couldn't just have Emma tell her boyfriend ahead of time that your house is undergoing repairs and to not worry about the mess.", "NAH. Honestly, I think your excuse is kinda weird but I wouldn\u2019t have people over while remodeling because of the potential safety hazard. That goes double for people I hardly know. In fact, you should probably just consider going to a sports bar/restaurant and catching the game there with your friends. \u201cConstruction site\u201d doesn\u2019t sound super safe. At the end of the day though it\u2019s your house and you don\u2019t have to have someone you\u2019re uncomfortable with there.\n\nEmma\u2019s feelings make a lot of sense here. Your excuse is silly (how do you know if her boyfriend is judgmental or not?), and she\u2019s justified in asking if she can bring her boyfriend along. Sarah and Chris are also a couple, which is most likely why this not being \u201cokay\u201d with you was unexpected. She\u2019s also totally justified in not wanting to go, and watching the World Cup with her boyfriend.", "YTA. If the only reason you're saying this is really just.. oh my house is a work in progress, get over yourself. Yes, your house your roles but that doesnt' mean your roels don't make you an AH.", "YTA. i don't get why you care what some stranger thinks of your home. And if it's an acceptable reason for the mess, then fine. it's not as if you're deliberately being a slob.", "YTA While it might be 100% accurate that your reasons are exactly as stated, it comes off as your reasons being some thing else and petty. Basically no one\u2019s going to believe that. So now it just looks like you\u2019re trying to exclude this poor guy on purpose and what has he done to you to be shunned like this?", "Light YTA. Of course you\u2019re not obligated to have anyone in your home you\u2019re not comfortable hosting.

If you do, then let go of the obsessive worry about how your one friend\u2019s new boyfriend is going to perceive your home. If you\u2019d extended the invitation to him, I\u2019m sure all he would have perceived you as would be a nice inviting guy who\u2019s inviting him over despite construction. Instead, you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s alienating his GF (your good friend) over a soccer party invite, and now he probably is (understandably) judging.", "Technically NTA mostly because you haven't met him yet but, I personally don't see the big deal.", "Sure, technically you have every right to make the rules in your home.

If he said no then he said no. No one is forcing this girl to come without her boyfriend, she can just as easily not come. It's not confusing at all, he's comfortable with close friends, how is that confusing? It sounds exhausting? Again if he wants to be \"exhausting\", it's his choice. Sorry not sorry but your comments is annoying that you think he either has to let everyone over who wants to come over or nobody at all. LMAO.", "The algorithm is this:  his house, his choice.  He doesn't want a random dude he never met in there so the guy doesn't get to come.", "What context is there here? All I see is a person who isn't comfortable inviting a stranger into their home. And your statistical claim there is inaccurate. Women are statistically more in danger of sexual and domestic violence, not physical violence as a whole. Nearly 80% of homicide victims worldwide are men. Men are more likely to be victims of a violent crime. \n\nBut again, kinda irrelevant. People invite their friends over all the time without the expectation of their partners being invited.

Lemme guess, he should just man up and deal with it?", "That's just strictly false.", "You\u2019re right. What\u2019s exhausting is letting complete strangers in his house, and not being allowed to because some folks on Reddit says it makes everything a sussy cover for something if he\u2019s not comfy letting a stranger in. He just wants established friends in his house so it\u2019s a good time.  Redditors need to touch grass and understand their partners aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s close friend when they\u2019ve literally never met.

Also OP has stated they\u2019ve never even met the man", "But again, that's not quite accurate. If he allows the guy in his home, he has to deal with the source of his discomfort in his face. If new boyfriend doesn't come, he may have to deal with discomfort elsewhere in the future but not in his own home. Which means he, at the very least, has an escape should it turn out he doesn't get along with the guy he has never met. Also note that I didn't bring up safety, you did. I merely responded to what you brought up. My point was his discomfort and his discomfort alone. \n\nErr, actually, going by your reply my women analogy is spot on. You said its not the same because women are more likely to be victims of violent crime, strongly suggesting that if the shoe was on a woman's foot you'd be saying NTA. And going by your insistence that it's so different for a woman than a man, I'm pretty sure that's what you're saying here. \n\nAgain, I didn't bring up the safety aspect. You did. I just said that if this post was written as is by a woman, the people voting YTA would be voting NTA. By bringing up the safety aspect for a woman even though safety isn't mentioned in the post, you're actively finding reasons to vote differently assuming only a gender swap. \n\nAnd I'm not projecting anything. Even without using those words, that's what you're saying here. His discomfort doesn't matter, he should deal with it. That's what a YTA vote means in this scenario. \n\nFrom Google: Man up - be brave or tough enough to deal with a difficult or unpleasant situation.\n\nYou're literally telling him to put himself in a situation he feels uncomfortable in, otherwise he's TA. He doesn't want someone to see his house as it is now who he has never met, that's it. I don't get why you think he'll be judged by the exclusion of a guy he never met. In the boyfriends shoes I'd think it's entirely reasonable for someone to not want to meet a stranger in their house and maybe suggest going for a drink some time in the near future to actually integrate with the group instead in an open environment.", "I know what \u2018man up\u2019 means, cheers. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is a gender issue at heart and I think you\u2019re slapping on a lot of hypotheticals here (the \u2018if this was a woman\u2019 line of reasoning).\n\nI think it may well be awkward in the future for these two guys but, hey, maybe they\u2019re both chill kind of people and it won\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019ve seen resentment spring up over less. Enjoy your evening.", "This is stupid and ignorant lol. I\u2019m in the process of moving, and I don\u2019t want anyone over because it\u2019s so messy. You and the other idiots can\u2019t actually be this stupid", "My wife and I don\u2019t like having people on our space in general but even more if things are messy/cluttered. Whether or not we\u2019d want someone coming over if we were in the middle of remodeling really depends on who it is. My goblin child of a friend from college who is a disaster wants to stop by for a bit? Sure. Our couple friends who live close by? Not unless this place is immaculate."]}
