It's insultingly bad that they're always late. Your mother acknowledges that there's an elephant in the room, but nobody should mention its presence.

The rest of you shouldn't have to adjust to their wasting your time.", "NTA.  When people are late we start without them.", "NTA \n\nLate people bother me to no end. As if their time is somehow more important, or they attempt to mask how they value their time over yours with excuses like ADHD. \n\nADHD is a real illness of course but it is not an excuse for being chronically late.", "NTA.

Is it possible that brother is the golden child who can do no wrong? Is there some history of this?", "Yep. Absolutely do not wait for these people.", "You sound like my wife's family. They are always ,\"fashionably late\", but my family is always punctual. At first we told them earlier times, then started without them. Always pissed off my family, and my wife was like your mom. Finally I put my foot down and insisted we do separate get togethers, one for my family and one for hers. She and her family are put out by it, but my side of the family and I love it!", "Well I guess I could have elaborated a little more. She doesn\u2019t like \u201cunnecessary\u201d conflict among family. She thinks that because we are family, we have to put up with behaviors that can bother us because that\u2019s what family does. I understand where she is coming from\u2026to a point. But I have a difficult time tolerating certain behaviors whether it\u2019s coming from family or a complete stranger.", "Everyone I know is like this. Even friends not just family. It might just be a Latino thing. Or maybe a SoCal thing? Sometimes traffic makes it impossible to get somewhere on time. You know? Plus the party keeps going till everyone is gone. So it really doesn\u2019t matter if someone is a couple hours late. Right?! Haha idk", ">... because we are family, we have to put up with behaviors that can bother us because that\u2019s what family does.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSo brother and SIL can put up with your comments about their tardiness and utter lack of respect then.", "Okay, I can see where she's coming from. This low-conflict and tolerance could and should be done in a different way for this problem.\r  \n\r  \nRight now, those who respect the schedule are being punished and the ones who show up late are being rewarded. Ignoring this builds up a pool of enmity and resentment that occasionally explodes.\r  \n\r  \nSuppose your mom stuck strictly to the schedule. Brother and SIL could show up whenever, and they'd just pick up with whatever is currently going on. If things just proceed without a blip, as if they'd been there all along, nobody gets annoyed, because it truly doesn't matter whether they were there or not. It becomes a matter of indifference about when they arrive. There\u2019s no conflict and you all can easily ignore their lateness.\r  \n\r  \nBrother and SIL may start adjusting their own schedule to arrive on a more timely basis in their own self-interest. If not, the only ones they're hurting are themselves."]}
