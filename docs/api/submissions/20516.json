Get together in the Philippines are not formal  you can pick up, mingle, talk to relatives as we have BIG families even if you are late it doesn't matter.\n\n There's also the heavy traffic especially in Cities which causes a lot to be late so we kinda think it's normal. Sometimes it takes you an hour and a half drive just to get to your destination in 4KM.\n\nYou can always start without them. Again this is normal in the Philippines.\n\nThis wasn't a formal event.

Very annoying but usually whatever. But when they were late to my mother\u2019s funeral (her sister) and we had to delay a little bit that was infuriating.  I felt for my dad. I\u2019ve never viewed her the same after that. It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful of people\u2019s time and effort. But some people have no awareness and don\u2019t care.  She hasn\u2019t changed either.", "NTA. They are inconveniencing everyone with their lateness and are incredibly rude. Should've called them out earlier tbh.", "NTA.

He didn\u2019t even come outside to eat with our family. I thought it was so rude and disrespectful to his wife (who cooked), his sons who were home from college and my Father. It was Fathers Day and my BIL didn\u2019t spend it with his sons! My Dad and I brought dessert, but we left before it was served. We were uncomfortable and upset at BIL\u2019s drunken behavior.", "Yes! Like I said on a similar post, I used to be a late person until a friend called me on it, and now I can\u2019t stand when people say \u201coh I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m always late!\u201d Like are these people being fired from jobs for being regularly late? If they have a flight, will they show up at the airport late and miss the plane? Will they come to grandpa\u2019s funeral late in the middle of the service? If the answer is yes, there is something deep and serious going on and I empathize. If the answer is \u201cno of course they\u2019d be on time!\u201d then no understanding from me. They can show up on time and choose not to because they don\u2019t care, are disrespectful of other people, whatever other reason.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my close friend explained to me that regularly showing up super late made her feel disrespected and uncared for. I lived in NYC at the time and had mental health issues as I do now so I relied on excuses like the trains being bad/traffic/typical NYC nonsense going on. Anyone who lives there knows. But my friend pointed out that I went to grad school classes on time, graduated and went to job interviews on time, then managed to show up to my 2 jobs on time. When I flew home to visit family every couple months, I made it to the hell that is La Guardia on time. Hearing that my friend felt hurt and unimportant really changed my perception and made me reevaluate and improve myself.", "NTA, im petty as hell and this happened to me I'd make a family bet. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Despite what you think, it\u2019s a part of how ADHD affects your life. As someone with ADHD, I never want to be late to anything, I feel awful when I am late, but sometimes it happens. I\u2019ll get super focused on something and just have no concept of time at all and you wind up late because of it. It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s like your brain can\u2019t stop something once you\u2019ve started. It\u2019s not like I actually need to read everything I can find on the internet about Wendy\u2019s founder Dave Thomas, then get side tracked to read about SCTV alumni Dave Thomas, then move on to Pete Ubu singer Dave Thomas but your brain really feels like it needs to. It\u2019s like if I leave in the middle of it, I\u2019ll only be able to think about it until it\u2019s done. So time just sort of happens then and you kinda have no concept that you spent 10 hours doing that. \n\nListen there\u2019s lots of things about having ADHD that are a bit annoying for people around, but someone being late to something and saying it\u2019s because of their ADHD is probably less annoying than actually having ADHD.", "I have ADHD and I make sure I am never (close to never, but typical people can be late too) late. Because of that, I am oftenly very early but wait (outside or in my car) until it's the appropriate time to arrive (I put on an alarm so that I will move and be on time and not get distracted from waiting). Alarmsclocks, notifications, getting dressed and done as soon as I wake up and not when it's x time before leaving... Yes I have a horrible sense of time and get distracted easily, but if I can get on time with my job else I get fired I can get on time for family. It takes effort a lot, and it's easier for me to be very early rather than right on time. So that's how I adjust. And while having ADHD is more annoying than people being late, I hate it when people use it as an explanation, as if not to try anymore. \n\nFunnily enough I do hate people being late and so does my family who all have ADHD, so maybe that's why this just grinds my gears lol.", "You're disrespecting people by being late, as if your time is more valuable than theirs. It's your job to manage your time and take all the measures you need to make sure you're in time. Leave two hours early if you have to. Put up a whole lot of alarms telling you when to start preparing to leave. Don't start anything you know will distract you and make you late. Ask a therapist to help you to manage your time if you need to. But don't waste other people's time.", "This is basically me! I hate people being late as well and I have ADHD.  It takes a huge amount of effort for me to be on time (and like you I tend to be early) but I do it if I think it's worth it.", "What a HUGELY ableist post!\n\nWow!!! Absolutely disgusting response.", "NTA, and your comment was pretty mild IMO.\n\nMy SIL uses her kids as the reason she\u2019s late to everything, one year it was my breaking point and I said \u201cWhat was your fucking excuse before you got knocked up?\u201d", "NTA Your comment was hilarious \ud83e\udd23", "NTA and I would say \"We left your plates in the microwave\"", "NTA.

Being disrespectful, or pointing out someone else's disrespect?\n\nCause that is what happened. Your brother and his wife disrespect everyone by always being late. You simply pointed out that you were being disrespected. \n\nNTA", "I mean, what you said kind of made you sound a bit racist, so ESH. Being late is only excusable if there was an emergency or something happened that was outside of their control, but that\u2019s just my opinion. You probably should have asked why they are always late when you guys are trying to stick to a schedule, probably could have ironed out the issues with a simple conversation, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "This is the answer OP. My aunt was like your brother and his wife. Always hours late, even with food. Once we started eating without them they magically managed to start making it on time! It was a miracle.", "I'm not saying this is everyone, but because I have ADHD I focus on not being late, and then I'm always way too early. ADHD Is not an excuse to waste people's time. NTA OP that's just rude.", "It doesn't matter the colloquialism... and here in the US Christmas Dinner IS a major deal... OP is right to call it out as the lame ass excuse it is... Get there on time or don't come... OP never hold events up for them in the future... their time is not more valuable than yours.", "I'm so glad you said this", "This is a weird take. OP and his mom doesn\u2019t have to wait for them to arrive. If shit is planned to start at 10am, get shit started at 10am. It makes zero sense to plan something at 10am, know they won\u2019t be on time, wait for them to arrive, then complain about them being late. Just start the shit on time. Its very simple", "I am like you- but I will say that it took 20 years for me to learn those skills and during those 20 years i was chronically late. It\u2019s extremely difficult to be on time with ADHD and all that clock setting, outfit changing, notification getting are habits and skills that are very hard to build with an adhd brain. \nEspecially if you don\u2019t have someone to help you, or you get diagnosed later in life, or you are unmedicated. People with adhd can\u2019t just wake up and decide to never be late again by really trying, its a huge learning curve.", "Ooh same! I truly get irked when people say they can\u2019t make it somewhere on time. Like I said in a previous comment when my friend got annoyed with me, I legit got into a habit of starting to get ready 4 hours early. I would shower and do my makeup and such and then sit around relaxing or doing work or what have you until I went to the train. It helped me change my mindset that if I went to work on time (because I\u2019d get fired if I didn\u2019t) I can be on time for friends too. I also used alarm clocks and calendar notifications for the habit as well until I could handle it myself.\n\nFor anyone who may need this technique: say my friend and I had plans to meet up for drinks at 9. I used to say I can leave at 8:30 and make it. But that didn\u2019t account for subway delays and such so I pushed it to 8:15. I had an alarm set at 8:15 telling me that I shall be out the door at that time. When my goal was to be ready by 8:15 I would never be on time. Shower would take longer, my cat would barf, I\u2019m distracted, whatever and I\u2019d be late. I made it my plan to be ready absurdly early. Like get in the shower at 3 or 4 and then do my makeup and be ready to leave at 5 or whatever. Then I would go about my life being ready to go. When the alarm went off at 8:15 I was totally good: no fighting the clock.", "Exactly. Like I've always had unpredictable work schedules so I always told family to just start weekly family dinner without me because I can't guarantee I can be there at a set time. If I end up having to reheat leftovers I'm fine with that", "Sounds like an inconsiderate thing. You were raised by inconsiderate people and therefore attract friends who behave the same way.", "NTA- even if they have ADHD/cultural explanations for their behaviour, these are not excuses. My sister with ADHD sets a tonne of alarms so that she can get places on time. Not doing so shows a lack of respect to those kept waiting. I\u2019m guessing your brother/SIL doesn\u2019t rock up to work two hours late because they respect the hours there. Family deserves the same respect, especially with turkey going drier by the minute in the oven!", "NTA. My mom was late to everything. We would have to tell her to be ready an hour before she had to be so we could be on time.  We were never on time for church. So, when she passed, we started her funeral 10 minutes late because we wanted one last time.", "NTA, because chronically late people suck. But 10am for Christmas at the in laws?! I'd just be honest and tell them I'll see them at 2 and to go ahead and start without me!", "Calling out someone who inconveniences everyone else is definitely NTA.", "Lmao \u201cthis ain\u2019t the Philippines\u201d\u2026\nNTA, it\u2019s one thing to be a few minutes- half an hour late but time after time they are hours late?? Rude and disrespectful.", "YTA, because the way you worded it kinda sounded racist rather than complaining about being late. Do they live locally or do they live in the philippines and fly in for holidays and are jet lagged as fuck and that's what she's referencing?\n\nPeople are late or turn up at different times at holiday gatherings, you just go on without them. So you open presents without them, have lunch when planned, if they miss presents they miss presents.\n\nLots of families also have their own traditions. Maybe they just open presents with their kids, do their own traditions then come for dinner.\n\nJust because your family want them there at 10am and then spend the whole time there doesn't mean they want to or have to.", "NTA\nThey\u2019re the AHs for not respecting other people\u2019s time.", "NTA I hate when people are continually late.

Your mother should stop playing doormat to your brother and his tardy wife. Lateness, unless caused by unforeseeable situations, is rude, bordering on unforgivable. If I was the one organising the event I would stop inviting them.", "I think youre being a bit rigid and need to communicate before you blow up saying rude shit that comes off pretty offensive. Like just dont hold up your schedule for their timing. But also, I dont get WHY you cant just change the time to 12pm if that's when they can make it, if the intent is actually spending time together. Are those two hours that precious? Can you have brunch while you wait? Open a few small gifts without them? People who come from different families/cultures/backgrounds dont have the same type of militancy around family gatherings as you do. They also probably wont be offended if youre already doing stuff when they arrive. Disparaging someone else's culture isnt the move here and you said it in a way that sounded pretty bad/xenophobic. That makes YTA. This whole tight-lipped patrician holiday dynamic is my worst nightmare lmao.", "ADHDer with dyspraxia here, hello.. I\u2019m chronically late and my time management skills are second to none. I genuinely have no perception of time and I\u2019ve tried every hack imagined to help try and overcome this issue, but I\u2019m still late. \n\nI can assure you that it\u2019s not an excuse. Nor do we want to be late. The amount of jobs I\u2019ve been sacked from because I can\u2019t show up on time. I\u2019ve now got a job that understands, but I\u2019ve lost around 3k+ in the past 2 years due to me being late. Who tf want to loose that sorta money willingly? Because I certainly don\u2019t. \n\nThe amount of important appointments I\u2019ve missed because I\u2019ve been late. The amount of times people are pissed at you because your late. The amount of times you receive passive aggressive comments about being late.. and when you\u2019re on time, jeez.. the patronising comments you receive from people because \u2018you\u2019re actually on time for once\u2019. \n\nI would do absolutely anything to be able to have time management skills of a \u2018normal person\u2019.

Then he had the audacity to ask why we made him wait 10 minutes (the time it took to get there from where we were). Never made plans with him again.", "Your last sentence really bothers me. You do not get to tell someone what is more annoying to them. If they feel hurt because someone is always late (regardless of reasons), you do not get to invalidate their feelings. If you are occasionally late, that\u2019s a whole other thing. Lots of people are occasionally late do to unforeseen circumstances and not their general disrespect for other peoples time. It\u2019s the same if you have ADHD; being occasionally late is generally OK with people but only because shit happens.", "You need to be an adult and figure out a way to handle it. I have ADHD. I hate being late for anything. An appointment in the afternoon has me in 'can't do anything because I have an appointment later' mode so that I'm not late. Alarms, reminders, you name it. There is zero excuse to disrespect everyone around you by being chronically late. Yes, it is absolutely a very real problem with ADHD. But it's still a problem we all need to handle. That might mean just not making scheduled commitments, like agreeing to show up at a specific time, if you're unable to follow through.", "So what's your solution here? Because you are inconveniencing people yet with no real strategy beyond shrugging and saying, \"okay, that's how I am, you all just need to learn to deal.\"\n\nAnd for the record, I'm disabled too in multiple ways that need understanding and accomodations from others. But I have never just shrugged and told others, \"well, deal\". Working compromises are needed, yet you appear to have no idea how to do that.", "and i don\u2019t give a shit about anything you say", "Indeed it's a weird take. Filipino time is normal in the Philippines but so is starting the occasion without them, the late people playing catch up.\n\nThey need to be there earlier; it's not the Phils anymore after all.\n\nIt should be noted OP and his mom have been very understanding throughout.", "So you\u2019re continuously late for work, have missed several flights, restaurant bookings. Christmas dinner isn\u2019t a party it\u2019s a sit down meal. NTA OP Maybe next time say dinner will be served at 2pm prompt. Then start without them.", ">Suppose your mom stuck strictly to the schedule\n\nIt\u2019s better than having everyone else fuming and being passive aggressive with them when they do get there.\n\nBy starting whenever they choose to arrive, it communicates that the start time really is flexible.\n\nAlternatively, if your mom really isn't comfortable to change (i.e. start without them), switch to a buffet style meal, eat first, then open gifts. That way nobody sits around waiting to eat, the food is available through the day, and the people who have arrived on time can enjoy themselves. \n\nNTA.", "As another ADHDer who is perpetually early, it us so good to read I am not alone lol. I have spent thousands of hours, life to date, doing things like walking repeatedly around the block until I was \"only\" 5 mins early etc", ">it took 20 years for me to learn those skills and during those 20 years i was chronically late\n\nThis is what I came here to say. I had to figure why I was late and I had to train myself to avoid those pitfalls.\n\nMy main reasons for being late\n- chronically underestimating how long it took to do something (e.g. if I thought it was going to take 20 minutes to get ready, it usually took 45 minutes)\n- being overly optimistic about traffic\n- not being able to tear myself away from whatever I was doing, in order to start getting ready or to actually get in the car to leave\n- not being able to find my car keys, cellphone, handbag, etc\n- forgetting that I hadn't put petrol in my car and having to make an unscheduled stop\n- getting distracted and making a wrong turn\n\nThere are more, but you get the idea.\n\nThe difference is that I was usually enormously stressed about being late - it wasn't because I didn't care about other people's time."]}
