Get together in the Philippines are not formal  you can pick up, mingle, talk to relatives as we have BIG families even if you are late it doesn't matter.\n\n There's also the heavy traffic especially in Cities which causes a lot to be late so we kinda think it's normal.

I\u2019ve never viewed her the same after that. It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful of people\u2019s time and effort. But some people have no awareness and don\u2019t care.

If they have a flight, will they show up at the airport late and miss the plane? Will they come to grandpa\u2019s funeral late in the middle of the service? If the answer is yes, there is something deep and serious going on and I empathize. If the answer is \u201cno of course they\u2019d be on time!\u201d then no understanding from me. They can show up on time and choose not to because they don\u2019t care, are disrespectful of other people, whatever other reason.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my close friend explained to me that regularly showing up super late made her feel disrespected and uncared for. I lived in NYC at the time and had mental health issues as I do now so I relied on excuses like the trains being bad/traffic/typical NYC nonsense going on. Anyone who lives there knows. But my friend pointed out that I went to grad school classes on time, graduated and went to job interviews on time, then managed to show up to my 2 jobs on time. When I flew home to visit family every couple months, I made it to the hell that is La Guardia on time. Hearing that my friend felt hurt and unimportant really changed my perception and made me reevaluate and improve myself.", "NTA, im petty as hell and this happened to me I'd make a family bet. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Despite what you think, it\u2019s a part of how ADHD affects your life. As someone with ADHD, I never want to be late to anything, I feel awful when I am late, but sometimes it happens. I\u2019ll get super focused on something and just have no concept of time at all and you wind up late because of it. It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s like your brain can\u2019t stop something once you\u2019ve started. It\u2019s not like I actually need to read everything I can find on the internet about Wendy\u2019s founder Dave Thomas, then get side tracked to read about SCTV alumni Dave Thomas, then move on to Pete Ubu singer Dave Thomas but your brain really feels like it needs to. It\u2019s like if I leave in the middle of it, I\u2019ll only be able to think about it until it\u2019s done. So time just sort of happens then and you kinda have no concept that you spent 10 hours doing that. \n\nListen there\u2019s lots of things about having ADHD that are a bit annoying for people around, but someone being late to something and saying it\u2019s because of their ADHD is probably less annoying than actually having ADHD.", "I have ADHD and I make sure I am never (close to never, but typical people can be late too) late. Because of that, I am oftenly very early but wait (outside or in my car) until it's the appropriate time to arrive (I put on an alarm so that I will move and be on time and not get distracted from waiting). Alarmsclocks, notifications, getting dressed and done as soon as I wake up and not when it's x time before leaving... Yes I have a horrible sense of time and get distracted easily, but if I can get on time with my job else I get fired I can get on time for family. It takes effort a lot, and it's easier for me to be very early rather than right on time. So that's how I adjust. And while having ADHD is more annoying than people being late, I hate it when people use it as an explanation, as if not to try anymore. \n\nFunnily enough I do hate people being late and so does my family who all have ADHD, so maybe that's why this just grinds my gears lol.", "You're disrespecting people by being late, as if your time is more valuable than theirs. It's your job to manage your time and take all the measures you need to make sure you're in time. Leave two hours early if you have to.

Ask a therapist to help you to manage your time if you need to. But don't waste other people's time.", "This is basically me! I hate people being late as well and I have ADHD.

Being disrespectful, or pointing out someone else's disrespect?\n\nCause that is what happened. Your brother and his wife disrespect everyone by always being late. You simply pointed out that you were being disrespected. \n\nNTA", "I mean, what you said kind of made you sound a bit racist, so ESH. Being late is only excusable if there was an emergency or something happened that was outside of their control, but that\u2019s just my opinion. You probably should have asked why they are always late when you guys are trying to stick to a schedule, probably could have ironed out the issues with a simple conversation, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "This is the answer OP. My aunt was like your brother and his wife. Always hours late, even with food. Once we started eating without them they magically managed to start making it on time! It was a miracle.", "I'm not saying this is everyone, but because I have ADHD I focus on not being late, and then I'm always way too early. ADHD Is not an excuse to waste people's time. NTA OP that's just rude.", "It doesn't matter the colloquialism... and here in the US Christmas Dinner IS a major deal... OP is right to call it out as the lame ass excuse it is... Get there on time or don't come... OP never hold events up for them in the future... their time is not more valuable than yours.", "I'm so glad you said this", "This is a weird take. OP and his mom doesn\u2019t have to wait for them to arrive. If shit is planned to start at 10am, get shit started at 10am. It makes zero sense to plan something at 10am, know they won\u2019t be on time, wait for them to arrive, then complain about them being late. Just start the shit on time. Its very simple", "I am like you- but I will say that it took 20 years for me to learn those skills and during those 20 years i was chronically late. It\u2019s extremely difficult to be on time with ADHD and all that clock setting, outfit changing, notification getting are habits and skills that are very hard to build with an adhd brain. \nEspecially if you don\u2019t have someone to help you, or you get diagnosed later in life, or you are unmedicated. People with adhd can\u2019t just wake up and decide to never be late again by really trying, its a huge learning curve.", "Ooh same! I truly get irked when people say they can\u2019t make it somewhere on time. Like I said in a previous comment when my friend got annoyed with me, I legit got into a habit of starting to get ready 4 hours early. I would shower and do my makeup and such and then sit around relaxing or doing work or what have you until I went to the train. It helped me change my mindset that if I went to work on time (because I\u2019d get fired if I didn\u2019t) I can be on time for friends too. I also used alarm clocks and calendar notifications for the habit as well until I could handle it myself.\n\nFor anyone who may need this technique: say my friend and I had plans to meet up for drinks at 9. I used to say I can leave at 8:30 and make it. But that didn\u2019t account for subway delays and such so I pushed it to 8:15. I had an alarm set at 8:15 telling me that I shall be out the door at that time. When my goal was to be ready by 8:15 I would never be on time. Shower would take longer, my cat would barf, I\u2019m distracted, whatever and I\u2019d be late. I made it my plan to be ready absurdly early. Like get in the shower at 3 or 4 and then do my makeup and be ready to leave at 5 or whatever. Then I would go about my life being ready to go. When the alarm went off at 8:15 I was totally good: no fighting the clock.", "Exactly. Like I've always had unpredictable work schedules so I always told family to just start weekly family dinner without me because I can't guarantee I can be there at a set time. If I end up having to reheat leftovers I'm fine with that", "Sounds like an inconsiderate thing. You were raised by inconsiderate people and therefore attract friends who behave the same way.", "NTA- even if they have ADHD/cultural explanations for their behaviour, these are not excuses. My sister with ADHD sets a tonne of alarms so that she can get places on time. Not doing so shows a lack of respect to those kept waiting. I\u2019m guessing your brother/SIL doesn\u2019t rock up to work two hours late because they respect the hours there. Family deserves the same respect, especially with turkey going drier by the minute in the oven!", "NTA. My mom was late to everything. We would have to tell her to be ready an hour before she had to be so we could be on time.  We were never on time for church. So, when she passed, we started her funeral 10 minutes late because we wanted one last time.", "NTA, because chronically late people suck. But 10am for Christmas at the in laws?!

Rude and disrespectful.", "YTA, because the way you worded it kinda sounded racist rather than complaining about being late. Do they live locally or do they live in the philippines and fly in for holidays and are jet lagged as fuck and that's what she's referencing?\n\nPeople are late or turn up at different times at holiday gatherings, you just go on without them. So you open presents without them, have lunch when planned, if they miss presents they miss presents.\n\nLots of families also have their own traditions. Maybe they just open presents with their kids, do their own traditions then come for dinner.\n\nJust because your family want them there at 10am and then spend the whole time there doesn't mean they want to or have to.", "NTA\nThey\u2019re the AHs for not respecting other people\u2019s time.", "NTA I hate when people are continually late.

If I was the one organising the event I would stop inviting them.", "I think youre being a bit rigid and need to communicate before you blow up saying rude shit that comes off pretty offensive. Like just dont hold up your schedule for their timing. But also, I dont get WHY you cant just change the time to 12pm if that's when they can make it, if the intent is actually spending time together. Are those two hours that precious? Can you have brunch while you wait? Open a few small gifts without them? People who come from different families/cultures/backgrounds dont have the same type of militancy around family gatherings as you do. They also probably wont be offended if youre already doing stuff when they arrive. Disparaging someone else's culture isnt the move here and you said it in a way that sounded pretty bad/xenophobic. That makes YTA. This whole tight-lipped patrician holiday dynamic is my worst nightmare lmao.", "ADHDer with dyspraxia here, hello.. I\u2019m chronically late and my time management skills are second to none. I genuinely have no perception of time and I\u2019ve tried every hack imagined to help try and overcome this issue, but I\u2019m still late. \n\nI can assure you that it\u2019s not an excuse. Nor do we want to be late. The amount of jobs I\u2019ve been sacked from because I can\u2019t show up on time. I\u2019ve now got a job that understands, but I\u2019ve lost around 3k+ in the past 2 years due to me being late. Who tf want to loose that sorta money willingly? Because I certainly don\u2019t. \n\nThe amount of important appointments I\u2019ve missed because I\u2019ve been late. The amount of times people are pissed at you because your late. The amount of times you receive passive aggressive comments about being late.. and when you\u2019re on time, jeez.. the patronising comments you receive from people because \u2018you\u2019re actually on time for once\u2019. \n\nI would do absolutely anything to be able to have time management skills of a \u2018normal person\u2019.

He also has told me that he won't blame me for telling him that things start earlier than they actually do.", "Absolutely! Rather too early than too late, I'll amuse myself until my alarm notifies me that it's acceptable to arrive, haha.", "I was undiagnosed and unmedicated until a few months ago, I know how life is that way.\n\nMy whole life existed (and still does, meds just help not solve) out of adapting and learning, with rise and falls, until pregnancy hormones threw my ADHD out of superwhack (nothing I did worked anymore).  I do not need an explanation about what is hard with ADHD.\n\nBut a difference between me and a friend, who both have it, is that he always victimises himself and this condition. ADHD makes things hard, but it's also hilarious. I love me and my whole family and our ADHD quirks. There are many positives to this divergency, even when other things are harder. \n\nPerhaps that's why this mentality just pisses me off. He thinks he is adjusting his habits, but when I ask to really tell me what he does differently, he said he makes a different planning. Which is pointless, if you don't have a sense of time....", "Yup this is my way as well. Make sure you can set an alarm and immediately react to it (like get out the door). And get ready earlier (dressed, make-up, shower) and do other life things in between.", "It took me years, yes, and I know a lot of fellow people who try hard. I would absolute have empathy for ADHD people that come up to 30 mins late.\n\nIn this post? That's two bloody hours and that's just insane.  There is no reason to be 2 hours late (not even if they would have had ADHD, which isn't mentioned).\n\nWe don't have a sense of time, but coming 2 hours late is inexcusable.\n\nThere is some leniency and empathy to be given to people with ADHD as it can absolutely be a challenge for but 2 hours vastly passes that limit.", "Everything is a spectrum.  It's why some people survive cancer, and others don't.  Why some people sneeze a half dozen times a day from their seasonal allergies, and others' faces are all swollen.  Why some people go nearly catatonic for months after a loved one's passing and others go to work the next day.\n\nYou're absolutely right, my friend.  I do not have ADHD, but I'm a recovering alcoholic.  My best friend stopped drinking nearly five years ago, and for her, she described it as a \"switch flipping\".  She admits it was incredibly easy for her, even though she's absolutely an addict.  I, on the other hand, stopped 15 months ago after five inpatient rehab and over a dozen detox stays.  After multiple IOP programs and nearly dying from withdrawal numerous times.  It's a spectrum.", "Oof, that couldn\u2019t have been fun.

But there are things most people can do to try and help themselves. It won't fix it, but people can help themselves and there is a loud perhaps minority of people with ADHD who straight up expect other people to pick up the slack on them being late.\n\nI'm not asking people not to be disabled\ud83e\udd26\nExactly, you've done what you can to manage it. You've tried things to help yourself and have adjusted your life accordingly.... Which is the exact point I'm trying to make. Read through the comments on how many people expect everyone else to be fine with them being late to everything. People are allowed to feel as if their time isn't being valued, and it is hard when somebody won't TRY to meet you in the middle repeatedly but expects you to accommodate them constantly. \n\nTaking regular breaks, which is literally one of the ways you're managing your back, isn't the same as turning up to places hours late. You're not refusing to help yourself.", "Well, one is by obligation and one is by choice. Clearly choosing to be late makes them the assholes.", "[removed]", "Same! I'm Swiss and had a mother (I'm NC) who would drill into us to be 5 min early. Punctuality is a massive thing here. I get anxiety when late.\n\nI'm struggling more since going solo 4 years ago, it was easier when I had a partner who patiently supported me to get both of us ready on time while I remembered gifts, cake or sunscreen that we needed to not forget. We completed each other in that regard haha.\n\nI'm almost always early or on time, but with some of my friends who also struggle, we have taken to saying \"around 12.45 in front of the venue\" when ticket or tables are for 13.00.\n\nOr if I'm late (seldom) because I have bad executive dysfunction, I let them know as soon as I notice that it's not gonna work out on time. They then go hold the table for me and I buy drinks for the night, or I call the venue and delay the table a bit. They are often glad to have an extra half an hour too.\n\nBut alarms have really helped, especially the ones 30 to 15 min before leaving. I try to be putting my shoes on and finding my misplaced phone 15 min before I have to go.", "Woah, great job, amazing!
