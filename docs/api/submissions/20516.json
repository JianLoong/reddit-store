Is it possible that brother is the golden child who can do no wrong? Is there some history of this?", "Yep. Absolutely do not wait for these people.", "You sound like my wife's family. They are always ,\"fashionably late\", but my family is always punctual. At first we told them earlier times, then started without them. Always pissed off my family, and my wife was like your mom. Finally I put my foot down and insisted we do separate get togethers, one for my family and one for hers. She and her family are put out by it, but my side of the family and I love it!", "Well I guess I could have elaborated a little more. She doesn\u2019t like \u201cunnecessary\u201d conflict among family. She thinks that because we are family, we have to put up with behaviors that can bother us because that\u2019s what family does. I understand where she is coming from\u2026to a point. But I have a difficult time tolerating certain behaviors whether it\u2019s coming from family or a complete stranger.", "Everyone I know is like this. Even friends not just family. It might just be a Latino thing. Or maybe a SoCal thing? Sometimes traffic makes it impossible to get somewhere on time. You know? Plus the party keeps going till everyone is gone. So it really doesn\u2019t matter if someone is a couple hours late. Right?! Haha idk", ">... because we are family, we have to put up with behaviors that can bother us because that\u2019s what family does.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSo brother and SIL can put up with your comments about their tardiness and utter lack of respect then.", "Okay, I can see where she's coming from. This low-conflict and tolerance could and should be done in a different way for this problem.\r  \n\r  \nRight now, those who respect the schedule are being punished and the ones who show up late are being rewarded. Ignoring this builds up a pool of enmity and resentment that occasionally explodes.\r  \n\r  \nSuppose your mom stuck strictly to the schedule. Brother and SIL could show up whenever, and they'd just pick up with whatever is currently going on. If things just proceed without a blip, as if they'd been there all along, nobody gets annoyed, because it truly doesn't matter whether they were there or not. It becomes a matter of indifference about when they arrive. There\u2019s no conflict and you all can easily ignore their lateness.\r  \n\r  \nBrother and SIL may start adjusting their own schedule to arrive on a more timely basis in their own self-interest. If not, the only ones they're hurting are themselves.", "A Christmas at the in-laws.  I'm pregnant  feeling sick I need to eat.  SIL her bf and his  mother are 2hrs late. I with permission from Mil have some food as the late ones walk in. His mother feels it's ok to comment on how rude I am.   I comment how late they are and if I'd known fetus and I would have eaten earlier instead of expecting lunch before 4.00 .", "NTA\nShe used the excuse \"Filipino Time\"\nWhich is a common expression here in the Philippines.\nPeople are chill with time here so most likely she grew up conditioned to that. It's a cultural difference. \n\nExplain it properly why you're upset. Again different cultural backgrounds. Get together in the Philippines are not formal  you can pick up, mingle, talk to relatives as we have BIG families even if you are late it doesn't matter.\n\n There's also the heavy traffic especially in Cities which causes a lot to be late so we kinda think it's normal. Sometimes it takes you an hour and a half drive just to get to your destination in 4KM.\n\nYou can always start without them. Again this is normal in the Philippines.\n\nThis wasn't a formal event. (Wedding Baptism) It may sound like I'm defending them but just trying to explain the reason why she used that excuse and the way she is. This does not excuse their behavior in anyway.\n\nSince you are a FAMILY part of being a family is communication why that is not ok...", "NTA - you should have asked what was their excuse for every other time", "NTA. Start telling them in a separate text or phone call 2 hours ahead of everyone else and then hopefully they will be on time.", "NTA. My aunt and as a result her family are always the late ones. Very annoying but usually whatever. But when they were late to my mother\u2019s funeral (her sister) and we had to delay a little bit that was infuriating.  I felt for my dad. I\u2019ve never viewed her the same after that. It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful of people\u2019s time and effort. But some people have no awareness and don\u2019t care.  She hasn\u2019t changed either.", "NTA. They are inconveniencing everyone with their lateness and are incredibly rude. Should've called them out earlier tbh.", "NTA. I spent most of my life being chronically late. No one who ever called me out on it was wrong.", "My brother in law shows up late to every dinner\u2026 that his wife (my sister) cooks or the holiday meals I cook in their house. This past Father\u2019s Day, my sister grilled filet mignon & ribs and my brother in law was fiddling with the humidifier and doing god knows what in the house. He didn\u2019t even come outside to eat with our family. I thought it was so rude and disrespectful to his wife (who cooked), his sons who were home from college and my Father. It was Fathers Day and my BIL didn\u2019t spend it with his sons! My Dad and I brought dessert, but we left before it was served. We were uncomfortable and upset at BIL\u2019s drunken behavior.", "Yes! Like I said on a similar post, I used to be a late person until a friend called me on it, and now I can\u2019t stand when people say \u201coh I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m always late!\u201d Like are these people being fired from jobs for being regularly late? If they have a flight, will they show up at the airport late and miss the plane? Will they come to grandpa\u2019s funeral late in the middle of the service? If the answer is yes, there is something deep and serious going on and I empathize. If the answer is \u201cno of course they\u2019d be on time!\u201d then no understanding from me. They can show up on time and choose not to because they don\u2019t care, are disrespectful of other people, whatever other reason.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my close friend explained to me that regularly showing up super late made her feel disrespected and uncared for. I lived in NYC at the time and had mental health issues as I do now so I relied on excuses like the trains being bad/traffic/typical NYC nonsense going on. Anyone who lives there knows. But my friend pointed out that I went to grad school classes on time, graduated and went to job interviews on time, then managed to show up to my 2 jobs on time. When I flew home to visit family every couple months, I made it to the hell that is La Guardia on time. Hearing that my friend felt hurt and unimportant really changed my perception and made me reevaluate and improve myself.", "NTA, im petty as hell and this happened to me I'd make a family bet. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Despite what you think, it\u2019s a part of how ADHD affects your life. As someone with ADHD, I never want to be late to anything, I feel awful when I am late, but sometimes it happens. I\u2019ll get super focused on something and just have no concept of time at all and you wind up late because of it. It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s like your brain can\u2019t stop something once you\u2019ve started. It\u2019s not like I actually need to read everything I can find on the internet about Wendy\u2019s founder Dave Thomas, then get side tracked to read about SCTV alumni Dave Thomas, then move on to Pete Ubu singer Dave Thomas but your brain really feels like it needs to. It\u2019s like if I leave in the middle of it, I\u2019ll only be able to think about it until it\u2019s done. So time just sort of happens then and you kinda have no concept that you spent 10 hours doing that. \n\nListen there\u2019s lots of things about having ADHD that are a bit annoying for people around, but someone being late to something and saying it\u2019s because of their ADHD is probably less annoying than actually having ADHD.", "I have ADHD and I make sure I am never (close to never, but typical people can be late too) late. Because of that, I am oftenly very early but wait (outside or in my car) until it's the appropriate time to arrive (I put on an alarm so that I will move and be on time and not get distracted from waiting). Alarmsclocks, notifications, getting dressed and done as soon as I wake up and not when it's x time before leaving... Yes I have a horrible sense of time and get distracted easily, but if I can get on time with my job else I get fired I can get on time for family. It takes effort a lot, and it's easier for me to be very early rather than right on time. So that's how I adjust. And while having ADHD is more annoying than people being late, I hate it when people use it as an explanation, as if not to try anymore. \n\nFunnily enough I do hate people being late and so does my family who all have ADHD, so maybe that's why this just grinds my gears lol.", "You're disrespecting people by being late, as if your time is more valuable than theirs. It's your job to manage your time and take all the measures you need to make sure you're in time. Leave two hours early if you have to. Put up a whole lot of alarms telling you when to start preparing to leave. Don't start anything you know will distract you and make you late. Ask a therapist to help you to manage your time if you need to. But don't waste other people's time.", "This is basically me! I hate people being late as well and I have ADHD.  It takes a huge amount of effort for me to be on time (and like you I tend to be early) but I do it if I think it's worth it.", "What a HUGELY ableist post!\n\nWow!!! Absolutely disgusting response.", "NTA, and your comment was pretty mild IMO.\n\nMy SIL uses her kids as the reason she\u2019s late to everything, one year it was my breaking point and I said \u201cWhat was your fucking excuse before you got knocked up?\u201d", "NTA Your comment was hilarious \ud83e\udd23", "NTA and I would say \"We left your plates in the microwave\"", "NTA. My sister-in-law and her family are the same way. They're from El Salvador and they're ALWAYS \"fashionably late\" to EVERYTHING. It gets rather annoying at times.", "NTA\n\nIf people are consistently late to the detriment and annoyance of everyone, they deserve to be called out for it.\n\nPart of the reason people are later is because they are taught that it is no big deal - everyone is polite and accepting and they don't realise how much is an imposition it actually is.", "Your mom was mad you were \"disrespectful\". \n\nBut what is worse? Being disrespectful, or pointing out someone else's disrespect?\n\nCause that is what happened. Your brother and his wife disrespect everyone by always being late. You simply pointed out that you were being disrespected. \n\nNTA", "I mean, what you said kind of made you sound a bit racist, so ESH. Being late is only excusable if there was an emergency or something happened that was outside of their control, but that\u2019s just my opinion. You probably should have asked why they are always late when you guys are trying to stick to a schedule, probably could have ironed out the issues with a simple conversation, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "This is the answer OP. My aunt was like your brother and his wife. Always hours late, even with food. Once we started eating without them they magically managed to start making it on time! It was a miracle.", "I'm not saying this is everyone, but because I have ADHD I focus on not being late, and then I'm always way too early. ADHD Is not an excuse to waste people's time. NTA OP that's just rude.", "It doesn't matter the colloquialism... and here in the US Christmas Dinner IS a major deal... OP is right to call it out as the lame ass excuse it is... Get there on time or don't come... OP never hold events up for them in the future... their time is not more valuable than yours.", "I'm so glad you said this", "This is a weird take. OP and his mom doesn\u2019t have to wait for them to arrive. If shit is planned to start at 10am, get shit started at 10am. It makes zero sense to plan something at 10am, know they won\u2019t be on time, wait for them to arrive, then complain about them being late. Just start the shit on time. Its very simple", "I am like you- but I will say that it took 20 years for me to learn those skills and during those 20 years i was chronically late. It\u2019s extremely difficult to be on time with ADHD and all that clock setting, outfit changing, notification getting are habits and skills that are very hard to build with an adhd brain. \nEspecially if you don\u2019t have someone to help you, or you get diagnosed later in life, or you are unmedicated. People with adhd can\u2019t just wake up and decide to never be late again by really trying, its a huge learning curve.", "Ooh same! I truly get irked when people say they can\u2019t make it somewhere on time. Like I said in a previous comment when my friend got annoyed with me, I legit got into a habit of starting to get ready 4 hours early. I would shower and do my makeup and such and then sit around relaxing or doing work or what have you until I went to the train. It helped me change my mindset that if I went to work on time (because I\u2019d get fired if I didn\u2019t) I can be on time for friends too. I also used alarm clocks and calendar notifications for the habit as well until I could handle it myself.\n\nFor anyone who may need this technique: say my friend and I had plans to meet up for drinks at 9. I used to say I can leave at 8:30 and make it. But that didn\u2019t account for subway delays and such so I pushed it to 8:15. I had an alarm set at 8:15 telling me that I shall be out the door at that time. When my goal was to be ready by 8:15 I would never be on time. Shower would take longer, my cat would barf, I\u2019m distracted, whatever and I\u2019d be late. I made it my plan to be ready absurdly early. Like get in the shower at 3 or 4 and then do my makeup and be ready to leave at 5 or whatever. Then I would go about my life being ready to go. When the alarm went off at 8:15 I was totally good: no fighting the clock.", "Exactly. Like I've always had unpredictable work schedules so I always told family to just start weekly family dinner without me because I can't guarantee I can be there at a set time. If I end up having to reheat leftovers I'm fine with that", "Sounds like an inconsiderate thing. You were raised by inconsiderate people and therefore attract friends who behave the same way."]}
