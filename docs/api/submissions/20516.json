Get together in the Philippines are not formal  you can pick up, mingle, talk to relatives as we have BIG families even if you are late it doesn't matter.\n\n There's also the heavy traffic especially in Cities which causes a lot to be late so we kinda think it's normal.

I\u2019ve never viewed her the same after that. It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful of people\u2019s time and effort. But some people have no awareness and don\u2019t care.

If they have a flight, will they show up at the airport late and miss the plane? Will they come to grandpa\u2019s funeral late in the middle of the service? If the answer is yes, there is something deep and serious going on and I empathize. If the answer is \u201cno of course they\u2019d be on time!\u201d then no understanding from me. They can show up on time and choose not to because they don\u2019t care, are disrespectful of other people, whatever other reason.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my close friend explained to me that regularly showing up super late made her feel disrespected and uncared for. I lived in NYC at the time and had mental health issues as I do now so I relied on excuses like the trains being bad/traffic/typical NYC nonsense going on. Anyone who lives there knows. But my friend pointed out that I went to grad school classes on time, graduated and went to job interviews on time, then managed to show up to my 2 jobs on time. When I flew home to visit family every couple months, I made it to the hell that is La Guardia on time. Hearing that my friend felt hurt and unimportant really changed my perception and made me reevaluate and improve myself.", "NTA, im petty as hell and this happened to me I'd make a family bet. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Despite what you think, it\u2019s a part of how ADHD affects your life. As someone with ADHD, I never want to be late to anything, I feel awful when I am late, but sometimes it happens. I\u2019ll get super focused on something and just have no concept of time at all and you wind up late because of it. It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s like your brain can\u2019t stop something once you\u2019ve started. It\u2019s not like I actually need to read everything I can find on the internet about Wendy\u2019s founder Dave Thomas, then get side tracked to read about SCTV alumni Dave Thomas, then move on to Pete Ubu singer Dave Thomas but your brain really feels like it needs to. It\u2019s like if I leave in the middle of it, I\u2019ll only be able to think about it until it\u2019s done. So time just sort of happens then and you kinda have no concept that you spent 10 hours doing that. \n\nListen there\u2019s lots of things about having ADHD that are a bit annoying for people around, but someone being late to something and saying it\u2019s because of their ADHD is probably less annoying than actually having ADHD.", "I have ADHD and I make sure I am never (close to never, but typical people can be late too) late. Because of that, I am oftenly very early but wait (outside or in my car) until it's the appropriate time to arrive (I put on an alarm so that I will move and be on time and not get distracted from waiting). Alarmsclocks, notifications, getting dressed and done as soon as I wake up and not when it's x time before leaving... Yes I have a horrible sense of time and get distracted easily, but if I can get on time with my job else I get fired I can get on time for family. It takes effort a lot, and it's easier for me to be very early rather than right on time. So that's how I adjust. And while having ADHD is more annoying than people being late, I hate it when people use it as an explanation, as if not to try anymore. \n\nFunnily enough I do hate people being late and so does my family who all have ADHD, so maybe that's why this just grinds my gears lol.", "You're disrespecting people by being late, as if your time is more valuable than theirs. It's your job to manage your time and take all the measures you need to make sure you're in time. Leave two hours early if you have to.

Ask a therapist to help you to manage your time if you need to. But don't waste other people's time.", "This is basically me! I hate people being late as well and I have ADHD.

Being disrespectful, or pointing out someone else's disrespect?\n\nCause that is what happened. Your brother and his wife disrespect everyone by always being late. You simply pointed out that you were being disrespected. \n\nNTA", "I mean, what you said kind of made you sound a bit racist, so ESH. Being late is only excusable if there was an emergency or something happened that was outside of their control, but that\u2019s just my opinion. You probably should have asked why they are always late when you guys are trying to stick to a schedule, probably could have ironed out the issues with a simple conversation, but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "This is the answer OP. My aunt was like your brother and his wife. Always hours late, even with food. Once we started eating without them they magically managed to start making it on time! It was a miracle.", "I'm not saying this is everyone, but because I have ADHD I focus on not being late, and then I'm always way too early. ADHD Is not an excuse to waste people's time. NTA OP that's just rude.", "It doesn't matter the colloquialism... and here in the US Christmas Dinner IS a major deal... OP is right to call it out as the lame ass excuse it is... Get there on time or don't come... OP never hold events up for them in the future... their time is not more valuable than yours.", "I'm so glad you said this", "This is a weird take. OP and his mom doesn\u2019t have to wait for them to arrive. If shit is planned to start at 10am, get shit started at 10am. It makes zero sense to plan something at 10am, know they won\u2019t be on time, wait for them to arrive, then complain about them being late. Just start the shit on time. Its very simple", "I am like you- but I will say that it took 20 years for me to learn those skills and during those 20 years i was chronically late. It\u2019s extremely difficult to be on time with ADHD and all that clock setting, outfit changing, notification getting are habits and skills that are very hard to build with an adhd brain. \nEspecially if you don\u2019t have someone to help you, or you get diagnosed later in life, or you are unmedicated. People with adhd can\u2019t just wake up and decide to never be late again by really trying, its a huge learning curve.", "Ooh same! I truly get irked when people say they can\u2019t make it somewhere on time. Like I said in a previous comment when my friend got annoyed with me, I legit got into a habit of starting to get ready 4 hours early. I would shower and do my makeup and such and then sit around relaxing or doing work or what have you until I went to the train. It helped me change my mindset that if I went to work on time (because I\u2019d get fired if I didn\u2019t) I can be on time for friends too. I also used alarm clocks and calendar notifications for the habit as well until I could handle it myself.\n\nFor anyone who may need this technique: say my friend and I had plans to meet up for drinks at 9. I used to say I can leave at 8:30 and make it. But that didn\u2019t account for subway delays and such so I pushed it to 8:15. I had an alarm set at 8:15 telling me that I shall be out the door at that time. When my goal was to be ready by 8:15 I would never be on time. Shower would take longer, my cat would barf, I\u2019m distracted, whatever and I\u2019d be late. I made it my plan to be ready absurdly early. Like get in the shower at 3 or 4 and then do my makeup and be ready to leave at 5 or whatever. Then I would go about my life being ready to go. When the alarm went off at 8:15 I was totally good: no fighting the clock.", "Exactly. Like I've always had unpredictable work schedules so I always told family to just start weekly family dinner without me because I can't guarantee I can be there at a set time. If I end up having to reheat leftovers I'm fine with that", "Sounds like an inconsiderate thing. You were raised by inconsiderate people and therefore attract friends who behave the same way.", "NTA- even if they have ADHD/cultural explanations for their behaviour, these are not excuses. My sister with ADHD sets a tonne of alarms so that she can get places on time. Not doing so shows a lack of respect to those kept waiting. I\u2019m guessing your brother/SIL doesn\u2019t rock up to work two hours late because they respect the hours there. Family deserves the same respect, especially with turkey going drier by the minute in the oven!", "NTA. My mom was late to everything. We would have to tell her to be ready an hour before she had to be so we could be on time.  We were never on time for church. So, when she passed, we started her funeral 10 minutes late because we wanted one last time.", "NTA, because chronically late people suck. But 10am for Christmas at the in laws?!

Rude and disrespectful.", "YTA, because the way you worded it kinda sounded racist rather than complaining about being late. Do they live locally or do they live in the philippines and fly in for holidays and are jet lagged as fuck and that's what she's referencing?\n\nPeople are late or turn up at different times at holiday gatherings, you just go on without them. So you open presents without them, have lunch when planned, if they miss presents they miss presents.\n\nLots of families also have their own traditions. Maybe they just open presents with their kids, do their own traditions then come for dinner.\n\nJust because your family want them there at 10am and then spend the whole time there doesn't mean they want to or have to.", "NTA\nThey\u2019re the AHs for not respecting other people\u2019s time.", "NTA I hate when people are continually late.

If I was the one organising the event I would stop inviting them.", "I think youre being a bit rigid and need to communicate before you blow up saying rude shit that comes off pretty offensive. Like just dont hold up your schedule for their timing. But also, I dont get WHY you cant just change the time to 12pm if that's when they can make it, if the intent is actually spending time together. Are those two hours that precious? Can you have brunch while you wait? Open a few small gifts without them? People who come from different families/cultures/backgrounds dont have the same type of militancy around family gatherings as you do. They also probably wont be offended if youre already doing stuff when they arrive. Disparaging someone else's culture isnt the move here and you said it in a way that sounded pretty bad/xenophobic. That makes YTA. This whole tight-lipped patrician holiday dynamic is my worst nightmare lmao.", "ADHDer with dyspraxia here, hello.. I\u2019m chronically late and my time management skills are second to none. I genuinely have no perception of time and I\u2019ve tried every hack imagined to help try and overcome this issue, but I\u2019m still late. \n\nI can assure you that it\u2019s not an excuse. Nor do we want to be late. The amount of jobs I\u2019ve been sacked from because I can\u2019t show up on time. I\u2019ve now got a job that understands, but I\u2019ve lost around 3k+ in the past 2 years due to me being late. Who tf want to loose that sorta money willingly? Because I certainly don\u2019t. \n\nThe amount of important appointments I\u2019ve missed because I\u2019ve been late. The amount of times people are pissed at you because your late. The amount of times you receive passive aggressive comments about being late.. and when you\u2019re on time, jeez.. the patronising comments you receive from people because \u2018you\u2019re actually on time for once\u2019. \n\nI would do absolutely anything to be able to have time management skills of a \u2018normal person\u2019.

However, if you take this person\u2019s glasses and put them somewhere they don\u2019t know, the person has to go looking for them. But they cannot see without their glasses, so they cannot find their glasses, so they\u2019re not able to see. In order to find the thing that helps them they need the thing that helps them. Can you see, how that would be very hard or even impossible for them to get the help they need without any outside help? Also, it would not help to scream at them things like: \u201cyou are lazy/dumb\u201d, \u201cyou inconvenience everyone around you\u201d, or \u201cyour disability is not your fault but your responsibility\u201d. That does not help them find their glasses; it just makes them feel bad.\n\nAlso, another example: Someone who has broken their leg, and now needs crutches to get around. Let\u2019s assume they need to go up some stairs and there is no elevator or escalator or anything else that would help them go up the stairs, just them and their crutches. So, it would be very hard or even impossible to go up the stairs. They would take a long time or even have to take breaks in between. Now, if this was your friend or family member, you would ask them how you could help or at least wait patiently for them, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nLet\u2019s assume further, the person has to go up that flight of stairs everyday with their broken leg. However, some days they are in very good shape, they are well rested, and their leg doesn\u2019t hurt at all. So, they can go up the stairs just fine and just as fast as you. But maybe, that exhaust them more than you and now they have a harder time to do other things than you. Sometimes, they might have a bad day. Their leg hurts like hell. They haven\u2019t slept well the last few days. Work stresses them out. They are very exhausted. In this case, they take a very long time to go up the stairs. Maybe, they have to take a break every few steps or they just break down crying because they are in so much pain and are so exhausted. Now, you would understand his situation and have empathy and sympathy, wouldn\u2019t you? You would understand that some days are harder and some are easier, wouldn't you? You wouldn\u2019t just scream at them \u201cbut yesterday you did just fine, why can\u2019t you do that today as well?\u201d or \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just try harder?\u201d, would you?\n\nLastly, let\u2019s assume that there are a lot of people, who have broken their legs. However, all their situations are unique. Some \u201conly\u201d broke their leg in one place, some in many places. Some have complicated fractures some don\u2019t. One has got an infection and is now running a fever. One has a very high pain tolerance, and one has a very low one. One has weak muscles in their arms, and another one has coordination issues so both of them have a hard time with their crutches. Some have gotten good pain killers, some got bad ones, for one they do not work at all, one is allergic to all pain killers, and one doesn\u2019t even need any pain killers. In the end, all have a broken leg, but for some it is easier to handle and for some it is harder. But, you cannot see that from the outside. All you can see are the plasters and the crutches. So, don\u2019t tell them: \u201cthat other person can do this, why can\u2019t you\u201d Well, because their situation is different. Additionally, what helps one person may not help another one or might even harm them.\n\nIt is the very same for mental illnesses. So, instead of hating people for not being able to do stuff like you can take your time and inform yourself or think about, how their illness affects their life and makes things harder for them. Also, if they tell you their limitations due to their illness, believe them and don\u2019t assume they lie or do not try enough. Because, believe me, we try, a lot, every day, and we know our limitations better than anyone else, because we live with them every day. \n\nJust because it looks like we don\u2019t try, doesn't mean we haven\u2019t done so. Most of the time, we have tried as hard as we could, we have poured all our energy into this thing, even more energy than we actually have, but in the end we still failed. Because no matter how hard we try, we still have a disease or disability that prevents us from doing everything just as well as every healthy person. But nobody can see how hard we try on the inside and how much energy that cost us. All they see is that we failed, and then they berate us and scream at us that were selfish, lazy, and stupid losers and failures. When we then try to tell them that we have indeed not failed as a person but instead have a disability or disease, they just answer: \u201cdon\u2019t use your disability/disease as an excuse/crutch for not trying hard enough\u201d We don\u2019t do that. We use it as an explanation and sometimes a reason that we are not worse human beings than everyone else for not being able to always do everything as well as everyone else.", "On of the problems with ADHD, is that the skills and things required to manage and treat this condition are the very skills and things that are impaired due to this condition.\n\nTake a severely short-sighted person for example; they can just get glasses, and then they're able to see again. However, if you take this person\u2019s glasses and put them somewhere they don\u2019t know, the person has to go looking for them. But they cannot see without their glasses, so they cannot find their glasses, so they\u2019re not able to see. In order to find the thing that helps them they need the thing that helps them. \n\nAlso, it would not help to scream at them things like: \u201cyou are lazy/dumb\u201d, \u201cyou inconvenience/disrespect everyone around you\u201d, or \u201cyour disability is not your fault but your responsibility\u201d. That does not help them find their glasses; it just makes them feel bad.\n\nCan you see, how that would be very hard or even impossible for them to get the help they need without any outside help? Even if you get outside help, it does not magically give you the skill sets you need to have. It takes a lot of time, energy, and failed attempts, and maybe some people can never do it.", "I\u2019m physically disabled and have ADHD. I find it really interesting that having a flare-up is seen as a legitimate reason for being late, but ADHD paralysis or time blindness is not. To me, both of these things are equally debilitating.

And really engaged them in talking about what they want to do for the holiday?

Nowhere in the original post does it say there is a diagnosis and I would argue being chronically late to the degree they are is likely due to some type of medical issue. \"Normal\" people aren't chronically late like that. Asking a person to manage a disability they don't even know they have is ridiculous. \n\nAccommodations are always required for disabilities and should always be available. That is what would provide equity and allow people with disabilities to be able to be on a similar level to someone who isn't disabled. I understand that it is hard to grasp in our current system but if there aren't available accommodations for everyone then that is an indictment on the system, not the person. If someone can't walk they will always need to be accommodated with ramps. If a ramp is not there the problem is not with the person who needs it. Putting the responsibility solely on the disabled person when they already have to work harder due to their disability just sets them up for failure. \n\nMy mom was chronically late to family functions my whole life. Our family ridiculed her for it and she was the butt of the joke. They were making fun of her disability even if they didn't know it at the time. And unsurprisingly, the ridicule didn't make her show up on time. Who would have thunk that you can't shame yourself into not being disabled anymore. \n\nAnd all of that is the point I'm trying to make. Is the chronic tardiness worthy of a discussion? Absolutely.

Disabled people understand that there are consequences to things. But at the end of the day, and I'm sure you know this, disabled people are already starting behind.

That has no effect on your ability to better meal plan, give yourself insulin or do sports (unless your blood sugar is really high or low, which would be an emergency). \n\nHowever, ADHD impacts your sense of time, your planing and organisation skills, your ability to control your focus and attention, your ability to control your impulsivity etc. which are all necessary skills to manage anything, especially something as complex as one's whole life.\n\nDo you anderstand the difference between those things?", "Ah, yes, \u2018grow up\u2019 is always a tried and true ADHD treatment.\ud83d\ude44\n\nYou need to learn more about ADHD if you think it\u2019s that simple.", ">Thats like saying, \"ADHD makes organization difficult, so I need to improve my organization skills to help me with my organizations.\"\n\nWhich is exactly, what all those \"helpful\" tips are doing. If someone says: \"I can't remember xyz because I have ADHD\" Someone answers: \"Have you tried remembering abc and efg\" But that may not help, because you still have to remember stuff. Maybe it is easier to remember abc than xyz, but maybe it is just as hard.\n\nIt is the same with other organization and time managment skills, like using planers, reminders and alarms. They are there to help you organise your life but in order to succesfully use them you need organisation skills which ADHDers usually lack to at least some degree.\n\n>That's the case with most conditions\n\nYes, diseases and disabilities make stuff harder, but for most of the physical ones they don't interfere with the very thing that is necessary to help them. If nobody hides your glasses, you can live a \"normal\" life using your glasses. Having diabetes does not interfere with your ability to give yourself insulin unless your blood sugar is really dangerously low or high. A broken leg does not hinder you to wear a cast or use crutches. Being blind does not hinder you to use a cane or service dog or being able to read braille. Do you see were I am going with that?", "So you don\u2019t actually understand how ADHD works? Because sometimes \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 means \u2018my brain is putting up an infinitely large wall that is preventing me from doing this thing.\u2019 You can\u2019t use tactics to get around the wall because you brain simply won\u2019t do them.\n\nTo borrow your wheelchair example, it\u2019s like someone telling a person who can\u2019t walk that they should just use that wheelchair up there at the top of the Empire State Building, but the elevators are broken and the door to the stairs is locked.", "And if there aren\u2019t enough people for soccer because they\u2019re waiting for everyone else to show up? Or if the host wants to serve dinner hot? Or if there are dinner reservations? There are so many times where it does actually matter. And like I said, if your group doesn\u2019t care so be it, but if you know the host cares and you still don\u2019t even try to be on time, then yea, you\u2019re assholes.", "this is such an apt way of describing it.", "I don't think you need to have organization skills to learn how to use a planner. \n\nOne of my friends was late to/would skip class and meetings all the time and it was hurting her academically, so she asked me and a few other friends for advice. I gave her some tips and tricks (having a planner/calendar, putting a post it note for an important meeting on your computer, using iphone reminders/alarms to get ready on time) and after our talk, she became a lot better at time management. \n\nYou don't need to have organization skills to become better at organization and use all of those tips and tricks. You just need to recognize that you are struggling and ask those around you to help you out and teach you how to use organization tools. And once you start using organization tools, you will become much better at organization (even if they do take some time to become automatic.)", "Fair enough. I already said in my last comment that you made a good point", "I mean congrats on bootstrapping your way out of being affected by your ADHD but maybe consider that doesn\u2019t really make you superior at anything except being punctual.", "Ok. I actually wasn\u2019t sure if you were saying that or trying to be sarcastic, problem with not hearing a person speak out loud. Have a good day!"]}
