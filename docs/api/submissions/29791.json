He told me he had left the hot tub a few minutes before and might have dropped an AirPod into the hot tub. He asked me if I could check so I looked around, groped around the sitting area with my hand (it was hard to see anything because of the bubbles) and also walked back and forth inside the hot tub a few times to see if I would step on anything. Nothing turned up so the man asked if I would go underwater for a few seconds to see for sure. Without elaborating on my reasons (the reasons were actually that it\u2019s gross and also too hot), I said \u201csorry, no\u201d and that I had reached the limit of what I could do to help. I also told him that the AirPod was most likely destroyed by the heat anyway. I doubt I\u2019m in the wrong here but the man got upset and called me an asshole before storming off\n\nEdit to add that he was already dressed so it wasn\u2019t as easy for him to go in himself.

The madness began way before the request to take a faceful of human broth. In fact the stupidity of the loss was a predictor of the stupidity of the request LOL.

Maybe he's just an entitled dumbass, or maybe it was some kind of ploy to... I don't know, distract OP so he could steal a phone or something nearby?  I can't think of what other scam it could be, tbh.  Probably a reach but I do wonder when someone asks for something really unreasonable like that, and then gets mad when you won't do it.", "I can happen.  The intakes are usually at your feet and if you have long hair, it can totally be sucked in.  I had a friend that sold them and showed me intakes were on different models and the pump in some was less than 4 inches from the intakes.", "Yeah, to that point, who TF does that? Can we gather a decent sample size of such people and take some surveys on what TF they are thinking?", "I do my best, thank you \ud83d\ude02", "There's only so much chlorine can kill, though. Not only that, but there's only so much filtration a cartridge (what's typically used in spas) can do when it's full. Once a pool or spa's filter needs cleaning (cartridges or DE filters usually need regular cleaning, sand almost never needs to be touched), it can just start spitting stuff back into the water. \nAlso, in commercial settings, the ppm needs to be above a certain amount as well as BELOW a certain amount. In my state, the regulations are that once a public pool is above 5ppm, it needs to be shut down until the chlorine lowers. Suggesting a minimum of 3ppm in a spa, especially when spas are often not even chlorine-based, is very irresponsible.", "Phosphates were discovered around, like, 10 years ago and chlorine cannot kill them. They can still get into indoor pools (I'm speaking from hotel experience, especially with usage, sunscreen and skin oils put phosphates in badly). You have to use a special treatment to remove phosphates and in a spa? It's more worth it to drain the entire thing. Whereas a pool almost never gets drained.", "First thought was ow eye infection", "\"Faceful of human broth\" made me chuckle. Thank you for that kind stranger! \ud83d\ude0a", "Rip long haired victims of jacuzzis", "Ewww. Why don't they clean it daily if there's that much gunk collected?", "We\u2019ll call on you when you\u2019re asked, thank you", "I used to use a pool nearby - after seeing the # of people who'd walk from taking a dump straight to the pool, I stopped. Not doing it again.", "Private ones are way worse on average...they don't get cleaned as often and the people who use them are less likely to wash before getting in. Keeping that in mind, I have two words for you: \"fecal\" \"shed\".", "It's collected from the filter. It's not all in the water. It's a little gross, but no more harmful than swimming in a clean lake.\n\nGranted, hot tubs do collect a lot of gunk. If you're using a private one you will see a lot of it. But public pools, including hot tubs, have fairly effective filtering throughput.", "Because not every week has the same usage and if it needs cleaning in between we will. The spa is fully drained weekly, though (not always, just where I am), so they do the deep clean then.", "I'm in the middle of closing pools in my area for the season and the amount of things I see absolutely baffles me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "I wasnt clear in my other comment lmao I tell customers that I'll only ever use my own spa, or that of someone I know well (literally, like, someone I'd consider having sex with or something lmao it's THAT intimate imo). You are LITERALLY taking a bath with everyone.", "Thank you for the information.", "Thank you for explaining!", "Elaborate?", "That's entirely reasonable \ud83e\udd23 I always think of it as at least I know there's a metric fuckton of chlorine in a public hot tub, but if I don't know the people with the private hot tub the chances of the maintenance being adequate go way down. If I know the person well enough I'd have to ask them very pointed questions about how they care for it before I even think about getting in.", "A few years back, my partner saw a pool that hadn't been opened in, like, 6 years, and the cover had disintegrated into just the straps. Trees had begun to grow, and the roots wrapped into the cover straps to form a floating island with upwards of 6 ft. tall trees growing off of it. That was open season, tho.\n\nNow brace for some ickiness and sadness:\n\nI just put a cover on one pool that was smeared in dog shit lmao\n\nLast open season, I had one pool whose mesh cover also had dog shit all over it, but had been seeping into the water like a tea bag\n\nAt open season, we often have to commit mass genocide on tadpoles. I have a pond that I bring them to, but I can only save so many, and I've cried multiple times because of how formed the babies are.\n\nA lot of people just stop checking their pools at a certain point, too lmao they'll just turn it off and the water is a swamp when we come to close, which sucks because often times we have to get in the pool to close it.\n\nYesterday, my partner just had to, essentially, free climb a rock fountain covered in algae to attach the cover for the pool. The water was around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nOnce, I had to fish a dead cat out of a skimmer (those baskets that collect bugs and leaves) that had been there for a week and was so bloated it almost blew up from the pressure change of me just moving it.\n\nOnce my coworkers found a dead dog in a pool.", "Read my other comments about public hot tub chlorine because you're really wrong.\nETA - that read as much more rude than I meant \ud83d\ude02 there's just very strict regulations about chemicals in public facilities", "Ugh. That's awful.\n\nWhen I was 16-18 I lived in a rural area. One road in and out. That road went through a wildlife sanctuary that was a breeding area for a certain kind of frog. During mating season the road would be covered in frogs at night and every night on my way home from school or work I'd have to drive over the frogs. I probably killed thousands of them every year. I'd cry every time.", "It's the worst! Like, you can't even do anything about it, especially since it's technically just nature and natural selection, but you still feel so badly! I'm sorry you had to feel that, too!"]}
