I was relaxing in a hot tub at the pool I often to go to when a man came running frantically up to me.  He told me he had left the hot tub a few minutes before and might have dropped an AirPod into the hot tub. He asked me if I could check so I looked around, groped around the sitting area with my hand (it was hard to see anything because of the bubbles) and also walked back and forth inside the hot tub a few times to see if I would step on anything. Nothing turned up so the man asked if I would go underwater for a few seconds to see for sure. Without elaborating on my reasons (the reasons were actually that it\u2019s gross and also too hot), I said \u201csorry, no\u201d and that I had reached the limit of what I could do to help. I also told him that the AirPod was most likely destroyed by the heat anyway. I doubt I\u2019m in the wrong here but the man got upset and called me an asshole before storming off\n\nEdit to add that he was already dressed so it wasn\u2019t as easy for him to go in himself.
