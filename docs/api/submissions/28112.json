I was the one (as a child) who had to plan the Christmas get togethers for both families because everyone was so bitter they wouldn\u2019t communicate.  This usually left me having a minimum of two, but sometimes more for grandparents, of every holiday.  I hated it.  It made me loathe the holly jolly season.  \n\nNow go back eight years, I meet my wonderful husband (27).  Each year is still me planning each holiday around my divorced parents, and his family that lives three hours away.  I usually get it figured out okay, and don\u2019t make too many people mad, but this year I decided I wasn\u2019t doing it.  (Gave everyone a years notice.).  \n\nOne big reason for me not doing five different holidays is that my husband and I have welcomed a wonderful four year old boy into our home that we are adopting.  Sadly, he didn\u2019t have a stable upbringing, and I really want his first holidays with us to just be filled with his loving family in our home.  My side of the family have put aside their differences for the little guy, and have decided they will all be joining us.   \n\nMy husbands family is a little challenging.  He has a sister who has assured us it\u2019s tradition to spend Christmas and Christmas Eve with her husband\u2019s family so they won\u2019t attend unless we make multiple different Christmas events.  They requested the week after the holiday.  While I am at work.  I pretty much said no thanks, and it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll see ya next year!  But this has not flown well with my husband\u2019s family, and I almost get the vibe my husband is sad as well.\n\nAITA for wanting one Christmas for once?\n\n\n\n\nEdited to add:::  Husband\u2019s family lives out of state, and it\u2019s illegal to take my son since the adoption isn\u2019t finalized until spring/early summer.

They are free to host another event if they want, but they cannot force you to do so or expect you to \"fall in line\".", "NTA\n\nThe holidays so often involve everyone with their traditions and you're expected to conform. There's nothing wrong with telling people that you are starting your own traditions now that you have a child. I did that once I had kids, too.

I've seen this so much in my own family, people have a hard time changing up \"tradition\" because family members get married, have their own kids, can't do what they used to.

Sometimes plans can't be the exact same every single year. \n\nFor example, we usually do Xmas lunch with my family and then dinner or boxing day with hubby's family. This year his sister is coming home for Xmas from overseas. We haven't seen her for a few years. My mum, sister and nephew were invited to my inlaws for Xmas lunch. They said no because my sister has already invited a friend over for Xmas night.

I hope you have the best Xmas.", "When I was a kid, we had a Christmas season\u2014we had all kinds of Christmas gatherings.  My great uncle started it off a week before Christmas with a big get together (kids outside with a ton of fireworks and adults inside playing dominoes).

It was awesome.", "Nah. Nothing wrong with having more than one holiday. Most families do, even when no one is divorced. \nThe issue is you always being the one to plan and move things around to accommodate. That can change immediately. When your son is officially adopted (congrats!) And you can move around freely, decide a plan that doesn't involve you doing everything and moving around to accomodate others. Cause it sounds like that is more the issue than more than one gathering (kids will gladly accept presents daily..lol) \nAs far as traditions, they change as people move, die, families grow, etc. \nTry to have some compromise with his family as you welcome this little boy.", "NTA. I hated and still hate the holidays because of this very thing and I don\u2019t do the several holidays a year anymore.", "I feel you! Grew up with divorced parents and shuffled back and forth then I got a license so then I was told  I could drive to my dad\u2019s side on Christmas. Then I got married and it was trying to figure out holidays with my in-laws and my 2 families. Plus seeing my in-laws had to be arranged around my SIL\u2019s in-laws.  It wasn\u2019t too bad since we all lived near each other. \n\nFast forward a few years and my husband parents moved out of state and of course when they came in for Christmas we had to make sure we were around. It was always me arranging get togethers, buying all the presents, wrapping, etc.  \n\nWe have 3 kids, 2 on the autism spectrum and it was just getting more and more stressful and of course my husband was useless in helping. \n\nThe pandemic hit and I finally was done. Christmas is at my house with my mom, stepdad, & brother. I meet my stepmom (my dad passed away before the pandemic) aunts, 2 cousins for a Christmas lunch which of course I have to organize.  My SIL drops by on the way to my nieces house (she lives out of state - 2 hours away) on Christmas Eve.   We finally have a system and I refuse to stop it.", "I thank everyone for their replies!  I will say I do love my in laws.  We usually get along great, but the holidays have always been headaches.  I want our families to be able to all get together, and that was the original plan last Christmas.  I definitely don\u2019t want to keep my child from them like some comments have been insinuating.  We even invited them over this weekend just to spend time with us.  I promise I would never want to keep my husband from his family.  \nThanks!!", "NTA but what is really common in a two parent household is to have one side of the family celebrate on christmas and one side celebrate on another date. In my family we would usually alternate thanksgiving and christmas each year (so if we go to moms family for thanksgiving then we celebrate with dads family for christmas) Especially if both sides are close by or one is distant. I think what is really ruining your holiday is probably the fact that you have to plan both of them. Now that things are happier with the families, are you able to step back from that job?", "NAH Divorced or no, it\u2019s pretty normal to have multiple family celebrations. When I was a kid, it was Mom\u2019s family one weekend,  nuclear family on Christmas, and Dad\u2019s family another weekend.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re opposed to celebrating with your husband\u2019s family the last Saturday in December. You don\u2019t have to plan it. Tell your SIL to manage it & your little family will be there. \n\nThe problem, I think, is that you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re the only one who can plan. Your dad\u2019s family can invite you, your mom\u2019s family can invite you, and your husband\u2019s family can invite you.

I sympathize, one side of my family got so burnt out on too many things to do at christmas that they literally cancelled all holidays for three years (don\u2019t be that way).

Hopefully you can work towards finding a day or holiday that will work with his family.", "NTA\n\nIt is good to have a quiet family Christmas.\n\nI don't think I could stand this you come to us, we go to them every other year business.

Stop catering to everyone else and focus on your family. Even your husband needs to realize that all the stress involved in trying to keep everyone happy is ridiculous.

Given the adoption thing, I get that legally you can\u2019t take him this year (though I\u2019m not counting that excuse because that was totally an afterthought and not part of your reasoning), but your shitty upbringing doesn\u2019t seem like a fair reason to punish your son and husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

TA-ly thing to do is give relatives a hard time for making reasonable holiday plans (and effort isn't constantly a 1-way thing).\n\nGift exchanges do not require face to face interactions, and something like zoom can be used so everyone can interact.", "I asked my husband to suggest a get together here on the 17th, but they read the message and never replied.  This was this morning.  \nHis family lives out of state and we legally cannot take our child out of state until the adoption is finalized this summer.", "As somebody who has to frequently be the one to travel for holidays.  Hats off to OP.  It\u2019s gets old always being the one whose expected to travel to accommodate everyone else.  It\u2019s not like she\u2019s never saying he can\u2019t see his family again.  She just wants one stress free low key Christmas.", "Husband family in a different state and adoptions isn\u2019t finalized until the summer. So they are not able to travel to them.", "This! Establishing your family custom is important. I ran the gauntlet of multiple Christmases with/for relatives, and the result was I never established our own \"family Christmas\". My kids escaped that holiday marathon with their own families. Give strong consideration to establishing your own Christmas tradition. Visit others before or after, maybe attend others later, but you will enjoy having your own family holiday rituals.", "That\u2019s what I was hoping.  Like one year with them and one year have them with my family.  That\u2019s why I told them last Christmas we\u2019d be doing this.  Husband\u2019s family lives out of state, and I legally can\u2019t take my son until the adoption finalizes beginning of summer", "This my husband and I tired of being the ones to always travel for holidays.  So we told everyone this thanksgiving we\u2019re staying home.\n\nMaking a feast fit for hobbits and elfs and binge watching the hobbit and LoTR movies.", "I thinks hubs is just sad that he won't see his sister over the holidays. OP didn't say he's voice any rejection of the idea or anything, in fact OP presented it as this was already the decision of what's to happen (no merry go round)", "That\u2019s awesome!  I\u2019m happy you have wonderful memories of the Holiday season", "I wouldn\u2019t necessary say things are happier between the families.  \nIt\u2019s more to keep my son happy.\nHusband\u2019s family is out of state so it\u2019s illegal to take my son there until the adoption is finalized Spring/beginning of the summer", "The planning started when I was a child because my parents would talk through me instead of to each other.  It has just kept going into my adulthood.  My husband offered to meet the 17th which is a Sunday, and his sister offered to meet during the week which wouldn\u2019t work due to us both working.  The end of December doesn\u2019t usually work as my husband has another sibling in college that likes to ring in the new year with friends \n\nI do feel like an AH because I feel selfish for wanting a Christmas with no traveling \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My family only does one Christmas. Either at home, mom side or dad side. We would rotate when we were younger but once we were teenagers it was always at home.", "We offered the 17th instead of the 25th and no one replied to it.  The sister was saying come during the work week.  When my husband and I will both be at work.", "I\u2019m sorry if I confused", "My husband and I talk constantly.  \ud83d\ude0c\nHe\u2019s actually at plumbing school right now or we\u2019d be talking up a storm.  My husband doesn\u2019t like to upset his family so he steps back from these matters and would rather me decide for him.  \nSadly, this situation has put us in a pickle.  But thank you for your caring!", ">they won\u2019t attend unless we make multiple different Christmas events. They requested the week after the holiday. \n\nIt sounds like OP is saying that if they don't come for Christmas day or Christmas eve then she won't see OP's sister at all.", "Oof.  My husband can\u2019t break the law, and get our child removed to go see his family.  We offered a different day they have yet to even reply to.  It\u2019s not my fault our families are in different states.  \nI do apologize for adding that thought as an edit.  \nAlso my husband has been on board with my Christmas plans since last year so I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m punishing anyone", "They offered a date and no one replied. That shows to me its not important enough to husband family to see them", "We offered for them to come down the 17th instead, but my husband said no one replied to his text in the group chat", "He offered the 17th in their group chat, but no one replied to it.  So we wait", "Ok, NAH then as long as you\u2019ve made an effort to see them.   I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fact that they haven\u2019t responded yet.   Maybe they were busy all day or know they have another holiday event that day and are trying to rearrange things.", "NTA. If he wants to, send your husband to see his family out of state the week after. You\u2019re working and the child can\u2019t leave the state. The end. If they don\u2019t like it then your SIL can adjust HER plans with her in-laws. Her family traditions aren\u2019t your problem. You have done enough sacrificing over the years to make everyone else have a happy holiday. You can be done with that. You\u2019re allowed to make your child and your wants and needs a priority. I wish you luck navigating this!", "It's only October. It's still pretty early to be formalizing holiday plans. Maybe they are not sure of their schedules and need time to think about it, especially if they need to travel. I'd give them a little time.", "You may not be able to change dynamics outside of your immediate family, any more than you could as a child. Maybe your boy is bringing up old wounds and some grief work is in order for you now. Your pain is not his pain, and its important to have clear boundaries and outlets for yourself during this transition so you don\u2019t add to his losses by expanding the story about disappointment and family. Everything might be okay, exactly how it is, if you can find ways to express your feelings regularly to caring therapist or friends? \u2764\ufe0f", "Ok tell him to send a question mark and if that dorsnt work ask your husband what we wants to do and have him plan and organize it.", "Yes!  I love his family!  Please don\u2019t get me wrong", "If hubby cops an attitude, she won't get it", "I totally agree! I was so excited to create our family's christmas traditions and make them our own. A divorce ended some of those, but I did it again with my 2nd husband. These are the things that your kids remember their whole lives.", "OH OP you gotta put that in the post! I was already on your side but this is a huge piece of information to not have included.", "Has your son said anything about the holidays that would make it seem he would be less happy with multiple? Usually as a kid i loved multiple holidays because it meant more gifts. People felt more obligated to get me a gift if they were going to see me in person at a party. You might be projecting your negative feelings of multiple holidays onto your son if he hasn't said anything? Obviously you would never make him work to set the holidays up the way your parents did to you.", "You're not selfish or stubborn. Sometimes compromises don't work out and people will be disappointed. That's okay and nothing to beat yourself up about especially when you have a new little boy to get hyped with! If your husband wants to see his family/have them visit let him plan it. No reason to stress yourself out or tell him he can't have the holiday he wants.", "You literally cant travel soo and the 17 is the only day that works for you. The end", "Oh, OP you need to get your husband a backbone! This is his family and so he really needs to stand up beside you and speaking to them. The way he's behaving now allows you to be the villain for everything they don't like, even if it was his idea or he agrees with you.", "My comment was mostly about your reacting to a \"vibe\" about your husband maybe being sad. If you're talking about feelings together, that's good. Don't let him step away from these relatives decisions. There will be more now that you've got a child!", "She was saying during the work week.  My husband and I both work in the plumbing field so we\u2019ll have to work normal business hours.  My husband offered the 17th in their group chat, but they haven\u2019t replied to it.", "How long ago did he send the message?", "NTA, because the other party is \"my way or the highway\", and won't compromise. You can just send gift via mail", "I feel you.  Sometimes you just want to relax and not the extra hassle of traveling.  Enjoy the holiday not worry about the semantics of it all. It\u2019s not like you are barring him from seeing them.  You just want to enjoy the holiday.  It\u2019s okay to put yourself and *your family* first.", "I didn\u2019t even think to include it to be honest.  I\u2019ll see if I can edit the post to add.  Thanks!", "He hasn\u2019t really said anything about the holiday\u2019s yet, but I know him going from place to place stresses him out as he bounced from foster home to foster home.  So I was worried about him stressing out.  But I didn\u2019t think about me projecting onto him.  That\u2019s a good point.  Being a momma is hard\ud83e\udd72", "I mean, which day in particular isn't really the point, obviously whatever day it is would have to work for y'all in terms of other scheduling commitments. I'm just more thinking that it sounds like you're resistant to the idea of finding the time that would work at all, whereas sister seems to be saying \"the 25th doesn't work for us but when else could we meet\" which on its face sounds pretty reasonable.\n\n(On a somewhat tangential note, is your kid actually going to enjoy meeting the whole family all at once in a big christmas party??? because off the top of my head I'd assume that a four year old with a traumatic early childhood would do better with smaller groups of new people, especially in potentially overwhelming situations like a christmas party.)", "It is indeed! A compromise I thought of. You could still have multiple holidays to make the family happy if that is the final decision, but make the deal breaker that it has to be at your house. It might be more work for you, but it would mean that your son would be able to retreat to his bedroom if he wanted and wouldn't be moved around as much. Just a thought. Hope you figure it out!", "I mean what day kind of is the point.  It can only be on the weekend as we both have M-F jobs with my husband then having college after work some days.  The days she has offered are during the work week.  We have offered weekends.\n\nI will say I didn\u2019t think about the actual Christmas get together stressing my son out.  He does tend to love to be the center of attention, and we don\u2019t have massive families, but that is something I will think about.", ">The days she has offered are during the work week. We have offered weekends.\n\nGreat, that's all I was commenting on. The point is that regardless of whether your schedules will actually align to allow you to see each other, there's a difference between being unable to schedule a celebration with them and being unwilling to schedule any celebration other than the main one you're planning on the 25th."]}
