The celebration was about the divorce being completed. Not about ex-SIL. You could have had the same party regardless of who got divorced. It's a long, difficult, and painful process. I don't blame anyone for wanting to celebrate the end of a massive, long standing, stressful, legal circus.\n\nIt sounds like the ex-SIL was determined to make this about herself, and how she was wronged, regardless of what reality is.

It doesn't sound like it but I thought I'd ask.\n\nPedantically, I'd say it doesn't sound like you were \"celebrating\" his divorce,  more like offering support to someone who went through a difficult time and is now over the worst part so the next phase in his life can commence.  Kind of like you might do when someone has completed cancer treatment and been declared cancer free.\n\nBut then YOU used the term \"celebration dinner.\"\n\nSo I'd say I vary between NTA in the sense that you weren't really \"celebrating\" the divorce to a very mild YTA because even if it's a long time coming, \"celebrating\" the end of someone else's relationship is kind of a low-class move.   To me, \"celebrating\" a divorce is a much milder version of hearing that someone you always hated had died, and you throw a party to celebrate.  Or you hear that your old boss, who you always despised, got fired from his job so you celebrate.  IOW, understandable, but still kind of dick-ish.\n\nIf there are no kids involved, I'd say a very mild YTA (in legal terms, not even a misdemeanor, more like a petty offense like speeding 5 mph over the limit.)  OTOH if there are kids who now have a broken home, then this is felony level YTA because you'd be celebrating the fact that some kids now have a broken home.\n\nTaking joy from someone else's misery is a dick move no matter how much they deserve it.\n\n**EDIT:  I see there were no kids involved so I'll go back to NTA.  IMO probably better to not use the term \"celebration\" but I get where you're coming from. Given that the divorce was a mutual thing and both parties are likely better off than they were before, I'd rate this as NBD and your ex-SIL sounds like a real piece of work.**", "NTA at all so long as this was all fine and dandy with the man of the hour, OPs brother.

My brother was all for it however.", "Yes he wanted out of the relationship, he knew what the dinner was for and was very happy to be there.", "100% this right here.  NTA.  Block her and move on.", "before blocking her send a single \"\ud83d\ude02\" in reply \n\ncompletely nta-- i have a few friends id do the same for if they got a divorce. maybe not so many people but toxic people leaving is a thing worth celebrating", "I love how he's going to get all these random views all from a reddit shout out \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Pi\u00f1ata- nice touch!", "I'm tacky as hell then because after my divorce, which was fairly amicable, a few of my friends and I went to Disney World for the food and wine festival for an entire week to celebrate!", "I don't blame you, I'm planning a party for when a ex friend dies", "Then NTA, you guys celebrated discreetly, and honestly, if you wanted to be petty, you could report the employee/server, but other than that, block the ex sil.", "NTA then. Although I\u2019m sure you can see how others may think it\u2019s distasteful to do that, especially someone who doesn\u2019t know the relationship.", "Agreed.", "I like the way you think!", "This is weirdly wholesome", "The server was wrong, but no restaurant is firing a server over repeating a comment she heard unless they are severely overstaffed (which is unlikely) and she was a shitty employee already. I have worked in a restaurants and all that would happen is a manager might tell her not to do that again. Especially if its a smaller restaurants that has regulars come in and ask for specific servers. I knew a girl that would get away with anything because the customers loved her. People gossiped all the time so it would be unfair that they would fire one employee because it blew up. Its not a favorable opinion, but its true.", "She might have sucked but I don't think comparing her to Thatcher is fair tbh /s", "Exactly what I thought too!  OP should definitely complain to the manager and let them know the wait staff verbally intruded on their celebration and then proceeded to tell what she overheard, which then made issues in his PERSONAL life. If the manager doesn\u2019t talk to her about this, he will be leaving a bad on-line review and will be letting his friends, family, coworkers know it is not a good place for privacy and celebration.", "And fly a plane over her house to spell out: GOOD RIDDANCE (HER NAME)!", "This is the way", " want stories. want stories NOW!", "NTA. It's sounds like that divorce was Independence Day for your whole family. I hope they didn't have any kids.", "NTA. Nope. I think it could have been a full blown party. Who cares what the ex thinks. Not your concern.", "Not even my own mom, if its my aunt she did it to, I'll fight her. There's no way she can be let into the house ever again. The pain after chemo is awful, how dare she", "Bruh if someone did that to ANYone, let alone someone battling cancer, I\u2019d yank it back from them so fast and watch them try to justify taking the pillow", "I called mine my \u201cbecoming a bachelor again\u201d party. It was epic.", "Wow... you're so petty. \n\n\nI loved it. I would do the same. Great idea, great idea!!!", "I'm in the process of divorcing a toxic a-hole. There will absolutely be a party when it's done.", "Oh! Nice touch!", "My ex and I call it our Un-niversary", "Well, look at the company they keep.", "In the wrong size and an UGLY color!! \ud83d\ude08", "My parents thought they were hiding their very loud arguments from us kids by going to the bedroom to do it. But it came right through the ducts.", "NTA and I'd report that restaurant worker to their management for their unprofessional behaviour.", "NTA\n\nDivorce parties are pretty common and it's not like you did this in front of her friend on purpose or tried to rub it in her face.\n\nHer friend should have kept her mouth shut.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your brother minded it, and that\u2019s what matters!", "NTA\n\nWhy your X-SIL cares what you and your family-friends does after their divorce.? And why your wife even cares what she thinks.?", "When my sister divorced, we had a whole night. Limo, drinks, toast, stripper etc. It was perfect!", "NTA I just celebrated my friend's divorce with a girls night out. We treated it like a bachelorette renewal party. We all wore sashes and hers said \"Divorced that Fucker.\" She got high fives and free drinks all night long.", "NTA but I will admit celebrating the end of a marriage rubs me the wrong way. As a wife, my insecurity says \u201cwow would you be that glad to be rid of me?\u201d I kinda get why your wife isn\u2019t pleased but in reality you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Just NTA. Some divorces are worth celebrating. Some aren't. Sounds like this one was. Ex-SIL can suck eggs. Who cares what she thinks? Not really sure why your wife is so bothered by it..", "NTA but what does your brother think? It was his party", "NTA. \nAny happy achievement deserves a celebration. We used to throw divorce parties on the regular back in our day. If ex-sister-in-law is bitter thats her problem now. Block her,  delete the number, and be thankful it's over. \nAgain, NTA.", "NTA throw an even bigger party and make shirts!", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything", "OP, definitely NTA as long as your brother sees it as celebratory!  It has been a year and I still have not figured out how to celebrate, lol.  But I figure I'm happy and FREE, so it is all good.  Congratulations to your brother, OP. And to your whole family for standing by your brother despite his choice.", "Made out of the marriage license", "Agreed! That\u2019s when she could tell her manager \u201cI need to stay away from that section\u201d, and then maybe tell his ex later if she wants (can\u2019t control that). \n\nThey\u2019re divorced. He could do anything. Cry, commit crimes, go to a stripe club, literally get married again ASAP. I think going out to celebrate is quite reasonable.", "Ending with a PSA for single men that if they see this person approaching them with a smile, turn and run.", "Let's not forget the singing telegram...lol", "You don't live in Denver, do ya?\n\n(Smells like shit and slaughter whenever it's gonna snow thanks to winds from elsewhere and topography)", "Yeah I agree with the person who replied to you, this wasn't the servers business, and the brothers weren't doing anything morally repugnant, like cheating. Many people celebrate divorces- should be more of a thing honestly, given (hopefully) that the people are trying make their life better when they choose to divorce."]}
