You could have just said no. You have that right. You don't have any obligation to give anything to anyone. This was a childish request and response from them to begin with and also makes me wonder why this person didn't have a caregiver if they are on this level of reasoning and function. They're clearly impaired enough to need one. Possibly they're also homeless and just that rude and shameless, and those people will often loiter on the bus instead of other places they'll be removed from.\n\nI'm autistic and disabled and this is not an excuse for poor behavior like James in this situation exhibited. Your things are your things and you do not have to give them to others.

You weren't on any obligation to give the man a drink if you didn't want to. It wasn't like it was an emergency.", "NTA, you bought the drink for yourself and should have had the right to own it and have it to yourself. Sure you could have been a good Samaritan and given him the drink but there was no incentive for you to give it to him if he was just disabled. James would have likely been able to survive without the drink and if he desperately wanted he could have gotten one for himself.

Like she was all coked out or something. Kept telling me I looked like a princess? At some point I take a drink from the water bottle that I got from my OB's office for the ride home cause it was 90\u00b0F+ and she asks me if she can have some.
