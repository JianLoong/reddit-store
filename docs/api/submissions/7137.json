This is the first year all the kids have been in school together. Every year in January and June the school has some sort of show, like talent show or band recital. This year it\u2019s a play by the 10-18yrolds. Sally and Jane both play parts. The whole family is attending, of course. For the play, both girls need knee-length dresses. When I looked for  dresses that fit the description, I only found ones that would fit Becca and Hanna. But everything else was too big or too small for the two actually in the play. The girls were excited because they thought they would get new dresses but I had to say no; their older cousins had hand-me-downs perfect for the play. (They were in good condition, no staining or rumples or anything, and fit nearly perfectly.) \n\nBut then they were grumping the next afternoon, they said they wanted to go shopping for a new dress really bad. But again I had to say no, we bought all their regular clothes and extras, we can\u2019t afford two brand-new dresses for perhaps one or two occasions. (They had other fancy dresses that didn\u2019t fit the description at home so they don\u2019t need a new one for one day). I understand it was special for them, especially Sally\u2019s first performance, but I can\u2019t waste money. And Chris said in the conversation if they kept being spoilt brats he wouldn\u2019t come and would go hunting instead. That\u2019s was harsh and I told him so. But now he\u2019s mad at me,( I /was/ rude while our talk after that conversation) and Jane and Sally are angry too because I won\u2019t get them new dresses. So I feel kind of bad, I could probably afford dresses but I don\u2019t want to waste money. AITA?\n\nEDIT: yes, I can actually afford having six kids. Ever heard of hand-me-downs? Doesn\u2019t make me poor. The girls got a ton of new clothes for Christmas but their dresses didn\u2019t match the play requirement. Also when I said the only dresses I found would fit the younger two, I meant dresses from around the house.", "created_utc": 1673502564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109rs6q/aita_for_making_my_daughters_wear_old_dresses/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Luckily the school had a great wardrobe department, and other parents came through for me finding me outfits. It sounds like you have done the legwork to find them appropriate outfits.

They were always old-fashioned(even a few years makes a difference), and I felt like I stood out compared to my peers.", "NTA nothing wrong with hand me downs. IT\u2019s economical and good for the environment. My kids get plenty of these plus new clothes when needed", "NTA. I wear hand me down clothes from my mom on the regular, it doesn't make me poor or anything.

This is especially true for big fancy period drama costumes. Those never get chucked they get recycled forever. And at big award ceremonies most of the ladies are in borrowed dresses from the fashion houses. They don\u2019t buy them or even keep them, they just model them on the red carpet and send them back afterwards. They even get botox shots in their armpits so the don\u2019t sweat on them. \n\nAll that aside, borrowing dresses is completely reasonable.", "NTA. It's a play, maybe a couple of hours long.

Its about feeling of confidence you get while wearing it. You made it about the money. YTA and you're married to one too. \n\nYour husband sounds like a great partner...if you like making all the hard decisions and doing all the parenting. I feel like he just wanted to go hunting and was using that as an excuse. You probably could have burned dinner and gotten the same response.", "NTA. It's not the end of the world if they don't get new dresses for a play but I will give you some advice. My sister (11) is very tall for her age so any costume I ever used does not fit her, she had a play in october and needed a Japanese inspires costume. My mom gave her to choises she can have her new costume and use it for Halloween or we could make something with what we have in the house. She decided she wanted the costume and went trick or treating in it. Maybe you can compromise with them that you are getting them the new dresses but they can't ask for new stuff/clothes in the near future. Like yes if their shoes does not fit in two weeks obviously get them new shoes but not anything to fancy, just shat they really need.", "OP, if two new dresses are in no way gonna break the bank, just buy the dresses.

If you do give in now these daughters will know how to behave next time they want something, and so will all your other children as they grow up. I honestly don\u2019t think your husband overreacted, he doesn\u2019t put up with their behaviour. \n\nYou have proposed dresses for them, if they have saved money themselves they should eb allowed to buy dresses with that money. But since you\u2019ve already set the bounds I think you should stick to them if the second hand dresses truly does look good enough for the roles they play (and doesn\u2019t look like they are as old as your daughters are).", "YTA, they probably want new dresses because literally every person in their world will be looking at them for this one day only and they don't want to be embarrassed because of your broke-ness, not because they are being greedy or spoiled.  Are you sure you can afford the number of children you have?  2 of your children got new dresses and the other 2 didn't? Your husband's first response is to bail and go hunting instead of going to his children's show?  How hard did you actually look?  You do not seem to have taken the time to truly understand why they want new dresses so deeply.\n\nAs someone who was in the position of Hanna and Cory, the little humiliations that built up over the years was eventually too difficult to cope with.  Don't be surprised when some of your children do not have a relationship with you in 15 years.", " NTA. Your logic makes sense here.", "NTA\nNew dresses are not a necessity. As long as the hand-me-downs are clean and in good condition, they work just as well. Source: grew up wearing thrift-store clothes and family hand-me-downs.", "NTA. It\u2019s common for kids to wear thrifted or borrowed clothes for school plays. Especially if it calls for something very specific or something the students don\u2019t typically wear.\n\nThat being said, I think you could smooth this over a bit. Could you offer the girls a budget of $XX and offer to take them to a thrift store in exchange for chores? If you can\u2019t swing enough for a dress, maybe the girls can find some sort of accessory that\u2019ll match the borrowed dresses?

Why do people keep procreating when they can't afford it? I know! Not the AITA question, but Seriously. W T ACTUAL F?)", "YTA. Why did you have six kids if you can\u2019t afford to support them?", "YTA. I would be so miserable being in your giant poor family.", "YTA - you could have stopped after half the children so when they want something new you can afford it.", "NTA. Why waste. Maybe add some embellishments to make the dresses 'new'?", "NTA. \n\nHaving children is a difficult journey at times. It is often difficult to foresee how much money they may cost over time. For the individuals in here saying have less children, consider that one miscalculation does not make a bad mother. Stow your venom for the plethora of genuinely horrid parents in this world.\n\nAs for you, OP. Do not feel bad. Children nowadays want brand new everything. The reality is that you are doing the best you can, and that is to be commented; not forsaken. \n\nShame on all of you who are giving this woman a hard time. The children already exist, obviously all that can be done now is her very best.", "NTA in the slightest. My children are the 6th and 8th out of 9 children within the family. They live in hand me downs and it's very rare I get them brand new clothes. As long as the clothes are in good condition and not tatty, I see no problem.", "NTA you are talking about costumes, some places that put on plays supply the costumes. This is no different because they wouldn\u2019t be new either. It\u2019s not like you are talking about their wardrobe. Don\u2019t let people bully you", "Soft YTA because I think you might have a blind spot for how your kids might actually feel. Going onstage with dresses that don\u2019t make you feel confident is pretty heartbreaking. Kids are definitely aware of what they have in comparison with others, that\u2019s just part of social mirroring. \n\nBut you might also have a blind spot in quality \n\u2014It wasn\u2019t until I left my mom\u2019s hoarder home (and also had some blind spots about what what actually nice cleanly pressed clothing) I felt like a new person when I started wearing clean new clothes that fit me as a person instead of hand me downs. \n\nThe crazy thing is that my moms mom was a renowned seamstress and embroiderer with a lot of taste.  My mom tended to scoff at these \u2018nice\u2019 things as an unnecessary luxury. To me, it felt good to care for things that I use\u2014not necessarily to spend money but it\u2019s okay to want a higher standard. \n\nTrust, I used to live in a multigenerational household\u20141500 sq ft of my parents, my siblings, both sets of grandparents and my aunt, uncle and two younger cousins. I slept on the living room floor for most of my childhood in a sleeping bag and didn\u2019t have my own room until I was 13 when my cousins family moved out into their own place. I know what it feels to need to make the most out of everything and I always had my older cousin\u2019s outdated handmedowns. I don\u2019t blame my parents\u2014it was hard to get by sometimes, but that\u2019s life. It \n\nBe a little more open to those needs\u2014even if you can\u2019t afford it now, just acknowledging how they feel goes a long way into accepting that it takes baby steps. \n\nI\u2019m 33 and my husband and I finally bought our first house and my baby will grow up with their own room, as well as a room for my mom when she stays with us. Anything can happen, and I hope your kids get to experience nice things for themselves and still appreciate their humble beginnings", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand why the girls wanted new dresses and a number of their classmates are probably getting new ones for the play.

Luckily for me, she seemed to always be ok with this - because when I was young I was as upset and disappointed as your girls when things like this happened.

Why is it x colour, do they love that colour or hate it, etc\u2026 etc\u2026", "I agree, also OP is NTA\n\nBut I'm always stunned when parents can't emphasize with their children's disappointment or emotions. Like the father instantly threatening to skip the whole event if they don't suck it up. \n\nOf course they are going to be disappointed, especially if they are the younger ones and often get hand-downs. It's not like they cussed anyone out, but even as kids their feelings are valid. I think this has nothing to do with being entitled.\n\nThe problem isn't OP, the problem is her husband for choosing to escalate things rather than dealing with his kids through talking to them.

Ridiculous.", "Agreed\n\nUnfortunately the fact that we have no idea what the structure and origin of her family is, and that she hasn\u2019t asked to be judged on that (in a sub where people are only supposed to debate the actual question) doesn\u2019t stop some people from feeling morally superior and making sweeping assumptions to justify their uninvited proselytising. \n\nBasically - it\u2019s rude.", "Mine would have as well, as I said, NTA for hand me downs, there's too much fast fashion out there anyway.\n\nIf she had just said she didn't feel it was necessary or appropriate that's one thing. But she complained they couldn't afford it, and complaining about lacking money when it was your own choice to create 6 new humans (which considering overpopulation is already a problem and young people are stressed about what kind of future they can even expect is incredibly selfish and detrimental) just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nNot that it matters if you're rich or poor, significantly increasing the population is a dick move either way. But its a dick move AND a stupid move if you're not rich.", "As I said, I've not problem with hand me downs. Actually I would take good quality hand me downs over fast fashion any day, I also grew up on second hand clothes and some of those were my favourite clothes. \n\nMy problem isn't with hand me downs. It's with people thinking their enjoyment of children gives them the right to create as many new humans as they want and having the audacity to complain about money whilst fucking the earth and therefore the rest of us over. \n\nNot everyone can have 6 kids or we'd be fucked, and the arrogance of thinking that doesn't apply to you, or the ignorance about not thinking of it at all baffles me.", "That play seems to be very important as the first response of their father was to not go as a punishment. Things like that can grow resentment in children. It is also the parents job to let them grow up happy and part of it is being proud of having something for themselves. If this is like a one time occasion then it should be treated as such. We don't have any info if they have that kind of event regularly or very seldom, so I can only assume out of the described reaction. Imagine not being able to be empathic enough to see it through the eyes of the children.", "Your assumption that people have 6 kids is because they feel \u201ctheir enjoyment of children gives them the right to create as many new humans as they want\u201d is grossly unimaginative and privileged. OP hasn\u2019t said anything about the nature or structure of her family - because that\u2019s not what she\u2019s asking to be judged on.\n\nYou did anyway, with a \u201cclaim\u201d that assumes culture, religion, social status, access to birth control, access to abortion and freedom from sexual abuse or coercive control. It means no blended families, no fostering or adoption. You assume that every child is a choice, when sadly it\u2019s not in many places in the world. \n\nMoreover, OP said she could \u201cprobably\u201d afford the dresses but didn\u2019t feel spending money on two dresses that wouldn\u2019t be worn again was justified. That\u2019s not \u201caudacity\u201d or \u201ccomplaining\u201d that\u2019s budgeting. That\u2019s not giving children everything they want went they want it.", "The father\u2019s response was not ok and responses like that would be valid for not wanting to stay in touch with your parents but not getting a new dress for a play is not. It\u2019s a play where you should be proud of what you put into it, not what you\u2019re wearing. Talent shows happen every year, they\u2019re fun but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s prom. I grew up with hand me downs until I could afford to buy my own clothes. Did I get bummed out when I couldn\u2019t get something new? Yeah, but I literally can\u2019t remember what they were for anymore. Happy childhoods revolve around the people not material possessions.", "Yeah very fair points. \n\nI made the assumption based on their English level, access to reddit, and cultural references like hunting and Christmas that it's likely they have access to education and birth control (but yes, not necessarily abortion which is fucked). \n\nTo clarify, if it wasn't a choice or the kids are adopted etc then of course my comments don't apply. The crux of my point is that *if* you CHOOSE to have this many kids then you're a dick.", ">Happy childhoods revolve around the people not material possessions.\n\nExactly, which means also respect what your children may want. The father doesn't want to go as a first response to being slightly offended by the children and  said that wanting something new is being spoiled. The mother instead of just going to a thrift shop and buying something \"new\", calls what the children wants a waste of money, which if she said that in front of the children is very hurtful. If money and attitude is that tight in that family, maybe family planning should have been smarter.", "The father was wrong for his reaction but if we\u2019re answering on if OP is the AH for not buying new dresses she\u2019s not. It IS a waste of money and I hope OP explained why it was to her kids because she should be teaching her kids so they know how to be smart with money. The reason why they don\u2019t own knee length dresses is because they just aren\u2019t likely to wear them after the play is over. The oldest is 16, lots of kids her age have part time jobs at her age, she could find a way to buy her own dress if she wanted to. It\u2019s just not worth putting the effort into because it\u2019s a play. Chances are if she gave them the option of pocketing whatever they would\u2019ve spent on the dresses they would also forgo new dresses.", "NTA.\n\nEven in the professional world, being in a play/performance can often mean wearing thrifted clothes, clothes from the company wardrobe (which have inevitably been worn in plays gone by and may have even been second-hand in the first place) or clothing from your own acting wardrobe, which you might have worn in plays before and once again a likely second-hand.\n\nAlso even in films or on TV some clothes and outfits are recycled! Actors I know always try to get the best deal on the right look. If they pay for a new piece to be made or buy something expensive, it's an investment for future performances/getting work.\n\nOf course, when it comes to school plays, there's a good chance there are parents splashing out on new outfits for their kids, but this is really not a necessity. If it's not in your budget, it's not in your budget.\n\nTalking to them about why they felt they needed new dresses for the performance might help you understand why they immediately assumed they'd get new dresses (I'm guessing it's being talked about at school?)\n\nIs there anything you'd be spending on them in future that you could even consider \"trading\" for a new dress? As in saying \"If you get a new dress for this play now for X amount, then the budget for this future thing will be down by X\"? Although it may work less well with the 11 year old who will be very tempted by instant gratification, a 16 year old should start looking at money in this sort of way anyway. (This is just a thought, not me saying this 100% is the best option.)", "NTA. Nothing wrong with hand-me-downs. These moments in life provide valuable lessons on wants vs needs.", "NTA at all. I was the younger sister and I wore mostly hand me downs probably through middle school.  Yeah it's nice to get new clothing, but it's not always affordable.", "You must think you and your husband are really f\\*\\*\\*ing special to reproduce so many times. Or you're religious. Probably both as religious people always think they are very very special.", "NAH. You're right to give them the hand me downs, especially if it's for a one time thing. That said, they are kids and it's normal for them to want new stuff. You're not a bad mom, and they're not spoiled brats, it's just a situation where they can't get what they want, even though what they want is reasonable. Don't sweat it.", "Info (based on your edit) : why didn't you pick out a dress that would work for the play and have that at an early Christmas gift?", "NTA. \nI love hand-me-downs and my daughters do too. The younger one can't wait for the older one to outgrow her stuff so that she can get it.", "Yta and trust me they will remember having hand me downs.", "Your husband hunts?\nFrom my understanding that can be quite an expensive hobby. Gear an ammo are not cheap. Yet there is hesitation on getting each girl a 40$ dress? \n\nOP I get being frugal but this is a special occasion. If your husband has money for hunting you have money for dresses. \n\nWhat your husband calls spoiled may be understandable frustration. \n\nINFO: what does your husband hunt and how much will his trip cost? (Gas, ammo, butcher costs)", "Yeah, the sewing was my idea, too - like, could they have made the dresses fit better, or shortened another dress that they'd have preferred?\n\nMy stepdaughter loves the things my nieces hand down to her, but I take care not to force her to wear the things she finds itchy or ugly.\n\nAnyway, a little empathy would have gone a long way here.\n\nBut OP is NTA.", "Once again, did you get everything you ever wanted as a child? No? Then why did your parents have a child they couldn't afford?\n\nOh right, they didn't, they just made choices on what was a priority.", "Big family, several older sisters.  I longed to finally get their dresses.\n\nIn this case, I might have sprung for two On Sale But New dresses, because there were three more girls in line to wear them. So they'd be used more than once.  \n\nThe oldest invariably get more new clothes than the youngest, that's for sure.", "Copy paste", "You might want to actually look into population impact, because it doesn't work the way you think it does.\n\nThe environmental impact comes from consumption, not population. Higher income countries regularly have fewer children per couple, but their consumption vastly outweighs parts of the world with higher birth rates.\n\nSo you should be lauding this woman for reducing her consumption by using hand-me-downs.", "If you say so! I'm the oldest of 4, I didn't get new clothes until I was old enough to have money of my own to buy it", "Did you get absolutely everything you ever wanted as a child? \n\nNo?\n\nThen maybe your parents shouldn't have had a child they couldn't afford.", "???", "Do you want to open up your life choices for criticism?\n\nBecause unless you were living in a hole and buying absolutely nothing new, growing your own food, etc., then you can consume more than the average person does if you take into account the entire world's population.\n\nRestricting reproductive freedom is not the way to solve ecological problems."]}
