That trip never happened but she made and picked up a Target order where everyone (except me) got some kind of Halloween blanket and snacks for school and other small basic things.\nMy wife also informed me a few days before my birthday that she was \"treating herself\" to a Friday the 13th photoshoot with a friend and had already paid for it.\nSo my day rolls around and at the end of the day there's nothing from her or the kids. Not even a card. She didn't even wish me a Happy Birthday, which honestly feels like it was what hurt the most looking back on it.\nI feel like I should also mention that I'm not really materialistic and when special occasions come around I really don't ask for much, I'm usually just good with money or a giftcard.\nI just really feel conflicted because when I spoke to her about it she kind of got offended that I even brought it up so now I'm wondering if IATA or not for even having feelings about it. She didn't seem all that sympathetic about it. To be fair she had been having what she called a 'tough week' so I'm trying to weigh my feelings against that and trying to find a common ground with it, but I'm having a hard time. Any help or advice or criticism would be greatly appreciated\n\n**edit for added context**\nI feel that I should also include that my wife is bi polar and deals with heightened anxiety occasionally.  She is on medication for those issues.\nSo when she says she had a rough week it was a mix of work anxiety and the meds not working as well as they probably should.

It sounds kinda like she totally forgot your birthday, which is completely different than not making a fuss. It's not hard to say \"happy birthday\" and get a card, and ask what they'd like for dinner and have something tasty for dessert.", "Nta.\n\nYour wife is a self-interested piece of work.\n\nWake up and value yourself.  Your wife surely won't.", "You are not.  Your wife is.  So what if she had a tough week.  If you forgot her birthday every comment here would be you are the a hole.  It takes 10 seconds to just say happy birthday. The fact that she got offended suggests to me that she did it intentionally to get back at you for something you did.", "NTA- any good partner will, at the very least, say happy birthday. Even if she's having a tough week and forgot, her reaction when you brought it up is unacceptable. Having a tough week isn't an excuse for intentionally ignoring your birthday, and then being flippant or cold or snappy about it.", "Wait till her birthday and treat her the same", "NTA. I\u2019ve been with my partner for 4 years and we are not wealthy and also not materialistic we value each other and what we have. We ALWAYS say happy birthday to each other on our birthdays. Often in multiple different ways. We also cook a meal, for them, whatever they want always homemade. \n\nYour wife \u201chaving a tough week\u201d tells me she isn\u2019t concerned about. She ordered from the store but didn\u2019t get a card or a small gift but had time to treat herself? That\u2019s disgusting to me. It\u2019s time to take a hard look at what you\u2019ve been married to for a decade. Sounds like she\u2019s more worried about herself than you on your birthday. \n\nTurn about a fair play I\u2019d get her less than nothing for her birthday. Maybe even take yourself out to your favorite restaurant and definitely do not say happy birthday to her this year. She hasn\u2019t earned it. Marriage is all about respect and she in not respecting you.", "She didn't do anything at all for your birthday?  Wow, she's a jerk!  For her next birthday, don't do anything and see how she likes it.  I can't believe she didn't even get you a Halloween item, either.  Ask her why she didn't observe your birthday at all, I don't understand.", "NTA, you're allowed to have hurt feelings for not getting so much as acknowledged on your birthday. I mean, if she's really not sympathetic, you could always have a \"tough week\" and forget her birthday as well. When she loses her mind, oh well, you figured your birthday wasn't important enough to remember, hers must not be either. Now keep in mind with this, I am petty as hell and feel things should be equal whether husband or wife. Try that at your own risk.", "Did she actually forget your birthday, or just choose not to acknowledge it? Doesn\u2019t matter, either answer sucks. She should have made some sort of gesture, even if mostly symbolic. NTA", "NTA. Her week wasn't  so \",tough\" she couldn't get Halloween junk or a photo shoot for herself. (A photo shoot? Really? )", "NTA. What your family did sucks.", "NTA. \nYour feelings are valid and so is your disappointment. \nYour birthday matters, she should have at least acknowledged you with a greeting. \nShe was wrong to get offended and should have apologised.", "NTA. I get not being materialistic and feeling a need for physical presents. But it stings a bit that your son specifically wanted to go to the store for your special day, and instead everyone else got something a little special except for you. I also understand having a hard week, as far as your wife goes, absolutely! Having 6 kids, I have been there. But a big part of marriage is making sure your significant other still feels love in the way they need. Even if that means putting off a reward for yourself after a particularly hard week for the time being, especially if it can be pushed back only a week or so.", "NTA if I were you I\u2019d stop doing anything for her birthday or Mother\u2019s Day.", "Dude check her phone.  You obviously now are not her priority not even your kid is, she ignored his request.  Track her movements.  You deserve a Queen what you have is a joke.", "I wouldn\u2019t be happy at all. I have been in a relationship for 7 years and we do something and buy gifts for every birthday. I\u2019m more worried that she never said happy birthday or sent a card though despite having a \u201ctough week\u201d", "NTA - go out and buy yourself a gift, maybe a cake also", "NTA. Especially after 10 years you still didn\u2019t get a simple \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d. I would understand the no gift if your wife is aware you\u2019re not materialistic. Everyone has rough days, weeks, and months. The effort it takes just to say Happy Birthday is minimal. Her reaction was uncalled for if you were explaining your emotions too.. well depending on what you said and how you said it.", "INFO:  Is this the entire story?  What did you get her for her bday last?", "Your wife had a tough week, and she even treated herself to a photoshoot with a friend. Maybe she needed that to unwind a bit. It's not always about the material gifts. You even said you're not materialistic. So why are you making such a big deal out of this? You've been together for 10 years. That's a long time. You should know by now that life can get in the way sometimes, and special occasions might not always go as planned. Instead of getting upset, maybe try to understand her perspective and be supportive when she's going through a tough time. Your reaction seems a bit selfish, to be honest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
