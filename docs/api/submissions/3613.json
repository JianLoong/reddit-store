You have a right to **CHOOSE** your own.\n\nIt appears nothing you do will make them happy. Stop wasting your precious energy trying.

Did you move from a small town to a \"big city,\" and get a lot of judgement for that?", "NTA. \nHer bf needs to understand your situation. Flights are expensive esp around holidays. They should be more considerate and try to put themselves in your shoes. You are happy for your sister and that's all that matters. \nAdditionally if everyone has already formed an opinion, then it doesn't even matter if you go this time. They will find another reason to be mad in a few days.", "NTA - You left to make a life for yourself and they\u2019re punishing you for it. You have every right to not to give into pressure and obligation which is often in full strength around the holidays (it sucks so much), and wanting to start your own traditions is completely normal! I personally don\u2019t understand why people want others present at such an intimate and romantic moment such as a proposal, but that aside he isn\u2019t considering any other factor such as travel costs, work leave etc. All he cares about is the praise he will get for proposing, being the good \u2018responsible\u2019 man and wanting to have their moment exactly as envisioned without thinking of the realities for others.", "NTA, send the bf an itemised list of your expenses and ask him to pay seen as \"its not even that expensive\".\n\nQuestion: if you were to get engaged/have a baby etc would they all travel to celebrate your life event? Would they travel and help you if you needed it? Have they ever visited you, just to visit you, using your place as free holiday accommodations doesnt count.\n\nRelationships are a 2 way st, if you dropped the rope would they keep in contact? Or do they expect you to put in all the effort to live up to their expectations?\n\nI would suggest therapy and learn to put boundaries in place that work for you and your partner. Blood doesnt always equal family and if they really do value the relationships they will work at them. \n\nIts ok to have your own life, to live it how you want, to have boundaries with the people in your life and ultimately to make your own family.", "NTA.

You've gone above and beyond, and they're out of line and being extremely selfish to give you grief for not having anything left.
