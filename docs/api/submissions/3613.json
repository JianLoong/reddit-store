It doesn't really sound like you actually even enjoy going that often.", "NTA.\n\n>This makes me resent everyone so much. I could fly home 190 times each year and it wouldn\u2019t matter to them. They will view me as an outsider unless I move home, leave my big career, become a stay at home mom and buy a house next door to the family like \u201cI\u2019m supposed to.\u201d\n\nThis is what struck out.  Your family and the sister's BF are entitled and selfish.  No matter what you do it will not be enough.\n\nSo stop.\n\nSTOP putting YOUR life on hold for people who simply refuse to respect you or your boundaries.  Stop allowing people to SPEND your money and guilt you into doing things that would cause a hardship.\n\nYou have your own life now.  Build your own roots.  Make those new traditions.  Honestly I wouldn't even bother going back unless there is a wedding or funeral.  You have hit pause on your desires for too long.\n\nNo more pausing.  Now it's time to play.", "NTA. Next time he texts you, send him a budget for the trip (boarding etc.) and thank him for offering to pay for the trip (in his own words, it's not that much!).", "NTA but you're right in that it will never be enough. Stop throwing time energy and money at them.", "NTA you are going to have to stand firm and set boundaries here. You life is where you live now and you need to move forward with it and create traditions there. Folks can pay to come visit you if it is so important to them.", "You're an adult. Stop engaging with this sort of behavior or you're going to have a very unhappy life. *They* aren't going to change, so it's going to be up to you to make this different. Stop using all your PTO on them. They keep harassing you? Well if you really don't want to block them, at least delete without reading. They aren't going to stop.", "NTA After every screen shot, send me the receipt of the flight ticket you bought me. Plus, I need the receipt for hotel rooms. \n\nIf they want you there, they can pay your way to get there. \n\n\nPlus if you ever get married, make sure they all have to pay cross country to come for all the events.", "I went through this when I moved to another country.  Unfortunately it's tough, cause there will be things you miss and it will play on your heart strings.", "NTA. It\u2019s like your family is punishing you for moving away. Amazing they are so generous with YOUR $. I would stick to your original plan 3-4 times/year. Like you said they give you grief no matter how many times you go it\u2019s not enough. Do they ever make any effort to visit YOU?  If not, sounds like a very 1 way relationship. NTA.", "NTA.  What part of you are out of PTO and cannot afford to travel do they not understand?  Even the BF doesn't understand.   Start your own traditions with your boyfriend.   Tell her BF if he wants you there badly, he can pay for the ticket!", "No way. The point is that she has a life apart from them. She doesn't come at their beck and call. She has PTO to deal with, and a bf to spend time with, and a life to live. She has no reason to keep showing up, just to get treated badly because she isn't following THEIR path for her life.\n\nHe can buy all the tickets in the world and she should just tell him to shove it.", "I agree with this.  It\u2019s time for them to accept that your life is not in the family compound staying home and baking cookies.  That\u2019s fine for somebody who wants to stay at home and live that life, but at some point they need to accept that that\u2019s not the life you want ti live.", "I think they'd expect her to fly to them with a newborn and then judge her the whole time for not quitting her job...", "a truly evil part of me would suggest emailing some of the texts from the bf to sister and asking if she has any idea why he's so invested in OP coming down...", "The key would be to miss some of these events - cuz, you know, work & money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "All on FaceTime \ud83d\ude09", "OMG!  This is wonderful!", "Bonus if you add in\n\n\"But I thought it wasn't even expensive?\"", "Yea, I mean the second sentence was somewhat sarcasm.", "I kinda get this. I was a 2 hour drive from my parents\u2019 l saw them on 6 or so holidays a year. I moved to Europe. Really moved. Sold the house & cars.\n Everyone wants to know \u201cwhen am I coming back for a vacation?\u201d Well it was only a lot of work when I was there and considering they didn\u2019t care that much about FaceTime when I was close by - NOW they want me to buy thousands of dollars in plane tickets, supplemental health insurance, rent a car, extra car insurance \u2026 nope nope and nope. We Can FaceTime or they can visit me in Italy", "Tough for them!!", "So..  how much of those four trips home were spent listening to complaints about how you never come home?\n\nYour family has a choice of accepting your life choices or not.  They chose not and their focus is on badgering and belittling you enough to make you give in and move back.  There is nothing healthy about this and if you use all your PTO time to go from work to another stressful place you will eventually burn out or break down.   \n\nMy advice would be that if your visits \"aren't enough\" then nothing will be and you should consider yourself first and think about cutting your visits down to once a year or stopping entirely except for weddings and funerals.  They've made it clear that if you don't do what they want by moving back nothing you do do will ever be enough.", "So many jokes...so many ways to get banned from reddit...", "and for OP's BF to come along", "I sincerely doubt abt of them would pay!", "I get it. But a lot of people make those comments in full seriousness and need to realize that it's not about money. It's about respect and self-respect.", "Kind of sounds like that's EXACTLY what they want, sadly. The OP says they're unhappy she's \"left the circle\" and they would love it if she lost her job and had to move back and never never ever leave them again...probably while also telling her to be independent and judging ever detail of her life.  \nI'm getting \"one of us, one of us, one of us\" vibes here.\n\nHonestly I think she needs to visit them even less than she has been, and maybe see a counselor to work on how to handle her family's intrusions moving forward, since she doesn't want to cut them off, but at the same time nothing will ever be \"enough\" for them, so she needs to find the balance that works for her.", " Partial comment stolen from OP\n\nBot Reported", "NTA he either pays for y ou and  your boyfriends flights or you dont go. Why do you have to be there - your sister is the one who has to be there not you. And if he insists then he pays for your prescence or waits until you go there next time.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I know this feeling as well, having moved away from my family too. You will miss out on a lot and you will need to be very strong and firm. In my experience, you become closer with your chosen family (eg. boyfriend) but you need to make sure to prioritize those other relationships.\n\nAnd don't worry about being completely left out, cuz your family will definitely remember you when they need money that only your higher-paying job and different career choices can afford... \ud83d\ude10", "> her bf just keeps sending me screenshots of available flights saying \u201cthat\u2019s not even expensive, stop making excuses.\u201d \n\nI'd send him an itemized invoice for the cost of the flight, boarding for the two dogs, hotel, cars, and missed paycheck, and include a per diem for yourself while you're at it. Tell him if it's not that expensive he should be able to cover the cost for your attendance.", "Wow. We live about 1000 miles from my in-laws (about 1600 km I think?) And we've seen them much more often than 2-3 times in 10 years. We usually see them once a year, alternating who does the travelling, since it's pricey. \n\nI'd be pissed if my family lived a 3 hour drive from me and only visited once every 4 years", "Don't forget OP's income! No PTO means no income, and there are still bills that need to be paid... \ud83d\ude08", "Fair enough."]}
