For the most part, we enjoy it and are able to indulge in our passion through our jobs. However, 2 years ago we gained a coworker \\[\\~25-30M, Scott\\] who is an absolute jackass, in my opinion. He works fairly closely with us, and he's the sort of person who thinks it's funny to throw his weight around and make fun of others. \n\nNow, I love a bit of playful teasing with people I actually give a shit about, but I don't like people I don't know making stupid comments and then hiding behind the \"just joking\" defense, which is exactly what Scott does. For some reason, he is particularly fond of making fun of Isaac. \n\nIsaac is a very tall, muscular man, so he may look rather imposing at first, but he is one of the most docile people I've ever met. As such, once people get to know him, it's easy for those who aren't being considerate to treat him like a bit of a doormat. Isaac hates this, but he hates it when people get angry or pushy with him and has a lot of anxiety surrounding this, so he rarely advocates for himself. I also hate it, because I love Isaac and he deserves to not be pushed around. I take no shit, and often advocate for Isaac when he feels unable to do so for himself.\n\nScott absolutely delights in picking on Isaac because of this and because of Isaac's general personality. He's made \"jokes\" about everything from tacky \"who wears the pants\" comments to telling people (while in front of Isaac) that if they want to go home early they can always dump their work off on Isaac to just being a douche and calling him wimpy or meek or any other sort of insult like that, followed swiftly by \"just kidding\" or some other copout. \n\nSometimes, Isaac will ask Scott to stop and occasionally Scott will listen for a day or so. Often, I will ask Scott to stop to the same effect (though usually with a comment about Isaac needing me to come to his rescue, or some other rude comment). Isaac has gone to HR about this, but so far, the most that has ever happened was our manager telling Scott that he should be kinder. Nothing would change, of course. \n\nToday, we had a work picnic. While there, Scott was rather tipsy, and he decided that was the time to make more jokes to the same effect that he does at work. At one point, he made a comment on how \"Isaac must ***really*** like being bossed around\" after making a crack about me and cracks about Isaac being a pushover (didn't hear that specific comment, but I heard the aftermath of it when I returned from the bathroom). \n\nI then told Scott to shut up. He started to speak, and I repeated that he should just sit down, shut up, and stop being such a nuisance. He told me I was being a bitch, then went to go sulk. Isaac thanked me when we left, but obviously Scott was pissed and our coworkers who were there were divided between tepid support of Scott, supporting us, and those who just wanted to avoid it all (fair enough).

Keep a shared google doc between you and Isaac and record everything he says, times, dates, and who was around to see or hear it. \n\nNote the lack of action from your bosses/HR in this document.

HR is definitely failing at their job to protect the company as this could easily come back to hurt them severely.\n\nAs they have made their stance clear, I strongly suggest you document your interactions with HR, \nit\u2019s possible that if you bring up hostile work environment or anything like that, they may try to terminate you and your husband employment.\n\nTo protect yourself, get any actions HR is/has taken in writing with regards to Scott in writing.

Scott, are you so insecure you need to tear everyone down, is it really that small... just kidding, Scott, do you even have any friends if this is how you think banter works... just kidding.\"\n\nJust a series of insults combined with just kidding before he can respond.

If he's not just joking then he has to admit that to have a problem with what you said.", "Document everything, even how many times you have raised this issue with HR and your boss.

Just keep pressing for an explanation.  You can back him into a corner where he has to admit to it when you finally point out to him that he knows it isn't funny and he was just being mean spirited, even if you have to \"put the words in his mouth\".  You probably won't have to do it more than once.", "I doubt Isaac would ever do that (anything he reads as confrontational is anxiety inducing to him), but I'll tell him.", "True, I could. I like the way you think", "Tried that already, actually, it unfortunately doesn't work.

I do appreciate the suggestion though.", "NTA but to HR immediately if not yesterday.", "NTA but document everything he says. Comments about who wears the pants and that Isaac likes being bossed around are sexual harassment. Make a formal complaint and be clear to HR that you expect them to take necessary action. Get a lawyer if they don't.", "It would probably work better coming from Issac than from you OP.  You can't legally speak on your husbands behalf and the company doesn't have to take anything seriously coming from a third party."]}
