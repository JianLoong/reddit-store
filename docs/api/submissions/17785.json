You were 100% right to rip the teacher a new one, but you should have followed that with an official complaint. I understand your anger.", "ESH. Removing your child from the class might not mean anything to the teacher, but it definitely means a lot to your daughter.", "YTA for moving your kid\u2019s class at the end of the year without discussing it with her. You negatively impacted her educational experience based on something that is unrelated to her education. You are not an Ah for ripping the teacher.", "ESH. The teacher's comment was way out of line and you weren't wrong to call her out on it.\n\nBut moving your daughter out of that class when she didn't want to and when the year is practically over was unnecessary. She shouldn't have to suffer because her teacher said something bone-headed.", "ESH. The teacher is an asshole for calling your teacher a scam artist. You're fine to rip into her but you aren't thinking about what's best for your daughter. She has friends at school.", "ESH.  Yup, the teacher is.  But so are you for going nuclear", "ESH the teacher is an a-hole and that\u2019s super unacceptable. I wouldn\u2019t want her reaching my kids either\n\nHowever you aren\u2019t considering what\u2019s best for your daughter and losing her friends part year will be hard on her", "ESH - The teacher was in the wrong for her comment.  You were wrong for not talking with the teacher like an adult but \"ripping into her\" (don't lower yourself to someone else's level) and taking your daughter out of the class so close to the end of the year.  The kids still enjoyed themselves and that's what the classroom is supposed to be about.", "I find it hard to believe your daughter was moved with a month left....over a stupid remark made by the teacher.\n\nWhy?  Now your daughter is in a class without her friends \n\nYTA", "The teachers comment was completely uncalled for but your daughter is the only one suffering consequences.\n\nESH", "YTA. Now, folks in this forum tend to consider retaliation okay. If someone posts \"This person was snarky to me and so I was snarky back,\" the common response is \"You were justified in being mean to someone who was just mean to you.\"\n\nI disagree. Once you retaliate, you lose the high ground; people will point at you and say you're being the problem. Would've been smarter to ask to meet with the principal and teacher together, with your husband to confirm what happened (as you weren't even there), and ask her to explain the situation. As it is, it doesn't sound like the teacher was even disciplined for her actions, and that the principal has also dismissed your concerns (telling you that you overreacted). So, instead getting a teacher to explain their behavior, you're the one seen as the bad guy.\n\nIf your daughter still wants to move back to her class, see if you could make that happen.", "Good job on punishing only your kid for this lol", "ESH\n\nTeacher was in the wrong, but lashing out makes you look bad and lessens the effect of you confronting them about their behavior. Gotta go into that level headed, even if it deserves it, people will weaponize your words.", "> Idk, am i?\n\nESH.\n\nThe teacher said something inappropriate and putting in a complaint would have been reasonable. You however are acting on your hurt ego and not in the interests of your child, which is terrible behaviour from a parent.", "ESH", "You're definitely over reacting. It's one thing to confront the teacher for being rude...it's another entirely to remove your daughter from her class permenantly, thus disrupting her school year. ...it isn't all about you.\nYTA, as well as the teacher for her unprofessionalism...and I'll say. If you want to rip into a teacher or educator, using \"unprofessional\" tends to bite harder than \"asshole\".", "YTA. If you're upset, file a complaint. Laying into her and pulling your kid out isn't the way to do it. Unless you plan on pulling your kid out of the entire school district, word is going to get around, and every teacher is going to know your kid as the student with \"that\" parent.", "The only one losing is your daughter. The teacher is probably happy to have one less student.", "ESH- the teacher shouldn\u2019t have said that but your child shouldn\u2019t suffer bc you\u2019re butthurt", "ESH the teacher should have kept the snarky comment to themselves, but you\u2019re not taking your daughters feelings into account. You\u2019re more intent to protect your husband (an adult), then have your child\u2019s best interest at heart. The teacher needed to hear how their comment was inappropriate, but let the principal deal with it. You\u2019re taking it personal and that\u2019s where this is all coming from.", "ESH. You\u2019re definitely right in saying that the teachers comment was uncalled for however I think your reaction was also completely uncalled for. First of all the comment was made about your husband and not you so it should\u2019ve been your husbands decision about how to react and whether or not to \u201crip in to\u201d the teacher, he\u2019s a grown man and can stand up for himself if and when he wants to. Second of all taking your daughter out of the class and away from her friends is just cruel to her. To your daughter it\u2019s going to feel like you\u2019re punishing her for something she didn\u2019t do and that\u2019s not fair to her.", "Wow.  What an unprofessional teacher!  She slammed your husband in front of your daughter and the class?  That is so hurtful!  She's the one who should be out of the classroom, not your daughter.\n\nI think that you need to make a formal, written complaint and send it both to the principal and to the superintendent of your district schools.  Ask for it to go into the teacher's file.\n\nRequest that the teacher make a public apology to your daughter.  She slammed your husband in front of the class, let her apologize in front of the class, or at least in front of the principal.  She also needs to apologize to your husband.\n\nIf the principal refuses to intervene, you might want to go to the superintendent and ask how you should proceed to have this teacher disciplined.  Seriously, take no prisoners.  This teacher shouldn't be in a room with children.\n\nIn terms of pulling your child, that's such a hard one.  I've had two situations in which my children were offered different teachers in specific subjects because of teacher misconduct, and in both cases, my children wanted to remain in the same classes with their friends.  But they were older.  In your case, if the old teacher has the terrible judgement to slam a kid's parent in front of the class, who knows how she'll deal with your child in the face of the complaint or the fact that you called her on her BS?\n\nSo I don't think you were wrong to move your child.  But if she's very unhappy in the new class in a couple of weeks, you might want to talk with the principal and the old teacher to express your concerns, see if they react appropriately, and if they do, think about moving your child back into the previous classroom.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Fortunately, your husband only rips off rich people. But, yeah, people who sell cars are scam artists.", "NTA. I will say it was a bit of an overreaction though, at least imo. But a teacher has no right to make comments like that, that was very immature.", "ESH. She made a stupid comment. You should have talked to the principal instead, and let your daughter stay in her class with her friends.", "YTA. Your conflict with the teacher is almost irrelevant - YTA to your child. The year is almost over and now she has to deal with school being made into a stressful upheaval rather than spending it with her friends getting ready for summer. I hope you\u2019re looking forward to her being incredibly resistant to going back to school in Autumn - she will be, and it will be your fault!\n\nYou owe that kid an apology, and you had better be the absolute soul of patience with any acting out or school resistance over the next few weeks. If she freaks out due to stress that you caused, you don\u2019t get to punish her over it unless you get the same consequences, since your tantrum will have caused it.", "YTA. I don\u2019t agree with the teacher\u2019s comments (even if I don\u2019t like car salesman either) BUT you are the washing for ignoring your child\u2019s wishes. She\u2019s gonna have a shitty year without her friends. You should have listened to her when she said she wanted to stay in the class.", "YTA, so much.\n\nDon't do that to your daughter. It's not what's best for her and you know that. It's the end of the year, let her enjoy it with her friends!  And next year, try not to be \"that\" mom.", "There is a chain of command in schools. I personally would have spoken to the principal instead of confronting the teacher. However, the teacher was out of line with  her comments and I can understand why you were upset. Name calling usually doesn\u2019t get you anywhere in these situations.", "ESH\n\nBruh I don't care WHAT you do for a living, if the teacher is doing color commentary on it in front of kids those are fighting words.  The hell is wrong with her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, you aren't punishing the teacher, you're punishing your daughter with this.  I get it, you're mad.  Go to the school district about it... but demanding your daughter be removed from the teacher's class and thus moved away from her friends is only hurting her NOT the teacher.", "YTA. The teacher was also an asshole, a big one, but you essentially have punished your kid for that. Your husband is an adult and is capable of speaking up for himself if he wishes. You got mad, went in hot and have hurt your child instead. You're the bigger asshole here for hurting a child.", "NTA. The teacher ITA and you\u2019re free to move your kid to another class of you don\u2019t want her to be around that person.", "NTA \n\nBut that teacher should have been suspended until the end of the year in my opinion and a new substitute teacher brought in.", "I don't think your TA. She made an ass out herself you just called her out on it. Tough shit. BTW my son is in 4th grade and his teacher is an ahole but she never did anything to him or me so I can't say anything so I am technically jealous of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
