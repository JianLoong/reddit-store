They are just hella embarrassed for being caught being an ass.", "NTA. \n\nListen if you never want something youve said to get back to the person you are talking about (good or bad!) just don't flipping SAY it???? \nDoesn't matter the language to be honest.", "NTA - she was being slick but instead got caught and made a fool of herself.  Happens more often than not when people start talking bad about others in another language and they don't think others understand them, and then it shows their true colors.  She was just trying to deflect onto you for looking like a gold digger.", "NTA speaking another language is something that\u2019s comes around when you need it. She is TAH for talking about you behind your back with the assumption you wouldn\u2019t understand.", "NTA. She just got caught saying something terrible and now trying to pin in on you.\n\nFirst of all, you have both been conversing in English since day one. There are no reason why you would suddenly mention you speak Spanish as well unless it came up in a conversation", "NTA\n\nWhat does she expect - you to wear a sign listing the languages you speak, just in case she wants to talk shit about you in a language you don't speak?\n\nThe world is full of people who make fools of themselves like this, by assuming that none of the people around them speak the language they are speaking.", "NTA. All she did was show her true colors and attitude when she didn\u2019t think you would understand what she was saying. If you had told her you wouldn\u2019t have learned that she was such a gold digger but willing to settle or so it sounded. Be glad you dodged the bullet there.", "NTA you had no reason to just automatically tell her.", "NTA. She was rude, she got caught, she tried to put the blame onto you. That's entirely on her.", "i\u2019d call her the ah for thinking you wouldn\u2019t speak spanish being a latino", "NTA.  She is very dumb to assume no one around her understands Spanish, a very common language many people either speak or comprehend.  Even if she were speaking an obscure language, she assumes the risk of being overhead and understood when she chooses to make a private call in public.\n\nNo, there's no social rule that everyone should tell each other what languages they speak -- in many settings, that would be irrelevant or even boastful.  Coming up with this brilliant fake rule a day later only confirms she's really not the sharpest knife in the drawer.", "NTA. She\u2019s just mad that she got caught. This is always a risk you take when speaking another language in front of someone you don\u2019t know well yet. What are you going to do \u2014 share the languages you speak with every Latino you meet within the first 5 minutes of meeting them because you speak English as well?

She feels foolish, so she wants to turn it on you instead of admitting embarrassment.", "NTA-If she didn\u2019t want to get caught being rude she should have simply avoided saying she didn\u2019t want overheard.

Are you so naive that you think they are not sometimes blunt and negative  with their friends behind your back?  Women say a lot worse to their friends about men they meet than this woman did.  You just never hear it.\n\nAnd how are you with your male friends in describing women you meet and date?  Would you want your dates to know what you really think and say?  She embarrassed herself, she apologized, and you responded with sarcasm and turning your back on her, which is extremely rude.  Now you are surprised and offended that she's upset and thinks you are an AH?  God forbid you ever marry, and overhear your wife talking about you to her friends. You'd divorce the poor woman before she could put her phone down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not your responsibility to say you are speak another language, you don'towe her that. She's rude and intended to use you. Her fault and loss, she assumed it's okay to speak candidly about prospects in front of them in another language. Good for you OP!", "Gold digger got caught. I hope you clued the guy in.\nNTA", "NTA, they shouldn't assume and she showed her true face to you. She's just upset she got caught.", "I feel she should assume you speak Spanish.
