Are you so naive that you think they are not sometimes blunt and negative  with their friends behind your back?  Women say a lot worse to their friends about men they meet than this woman did.

Same thing I say in all of these: if you don\u2019t want someone to hear what you say, don\u2019t say it out loud in public.
