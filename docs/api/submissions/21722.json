I personally believe it to be important for US born Latinx to not feel ostracized from what should be their community, their people, and their culture. At the end of the day, it's really not that impavtful a change for the people that dislike it, but it can mean a world of difference to those people. Too often do I see immense divides between children born in foreign countries to the rest of their greater family, me included. \n\nSorry for the essay.", "\u2026the asshole should also disclose they are an asshole ahead of any conversation.   \u201cYou should know I\u2019m an asshole, [major asshole.](https://youtu.be/PNcDI_uBGUo)\u201d", "And Duolingo and his cousins exist, and while I spent 2020 in my bedroom doing gamified French lessons (also tried Japanese but I have a learning difference that doesn\u2019t let me store shapes and patterns, including faces, maps, and new characters, which kinda interferes. The \u201ccan\u2019t remember a map just the words I came up with when I was analyzing it which is probably out of context here\u201d thing meant I was going back to my globe and my maps constant during my History degree and since but at least I could read the English,and now elementary school French with varying levels of support (Google Translate and Kindle translation option).\n\nWhich is all to say, English speakers can make decent enough progress with Spanish and French between apps, being able to call up TV/movies with subtitles, download foreign language books as easily as English (other than the speed the blurb for the book), switch to the French (Spanish, etc) Quora feed, and (if not me, who rarely leaves the house and is in Iowa, not one of the places where Spanish used to be the white peoples\u2019 language before the map lines moved) ride the bus to work and have basic awareness that tells you \u201cI thinkthey meant something about (thing in sight) and it was positive and oh, just placed a noun they used\u201d type learning which is how baby you learned your first language(s)\n\nSo ridiculous tothink it\u2019s an exclusive thing", "Yup. I am Canadian and haven't a drop of Hispanic blood in me, but my former BIL was from South America and my nieces (whom I helped to care for when they were small) were raised trilingual, with Spanish as one of their primary languages, so I picked up a decent amount of it just from being around it in their household. I'm the last person you'd think would understand Spanish . . . but you'd be wrong. That's also the case with several other languages, because it turns out I have a bit of a knack for them.\n\nNever assume that people won't understand you based on how they look or where they're from.", "I knew it! I'm surrounded by assholes! Keep firing, Assholes!", "Not all Spaniards are white. The genetic of Southern Spain and north West Africa are very similar. \n\nAlso some of us a very mixed. The white looking person could be mostly ethnic and vise versa.", "Many years ago I worked with a couple of French people. Not sure why they assumed I couldn't understand them, I know Americans aren't known for speaking languages other than English but I was a grad student in a field where we needed to read articles and books in other languages, including French. So one day one asked the other a question--I can't even remember what is was, I think one left something behind and I answered and they were both like \"Ohhh...merde.\" They had never said anything bad about me in my hearing, just about my boss, and he was an asshole so I didn't care.", "Very true. I was oversimplifying but I should have specified that I was. \n\nOn a side note, everybody in the Western world seems to be a mutt these days. I wonder how far you have to go back until most people were \"purely\" genetically local to wherever they lived.", "\ud83d\ude01", "NTA. \n\nIf I meet another indigenous person I assume they speak their native language. I speak English, Michif and am learning Latin. Some things I can pick up in other Canadian indigenous languages just through knowing michif and just generally being around natives. I assume it's similar for latinos or people whos parents/extended family speak a specific language. why cant she think that? \n\nalso why would you insult someone right in front of them?", "Agreed, however two of my professors would have conversations in fluent Latin and I think they were probably fairly safe!

If she were really interested, she'd continue talking to you not to whoever that was and call them back later. NTA", "I mean the way she flipped out at him after the fact is a pretty big red flag that she's not datable, but, I'd personally take the compliment as opposed to try to find an insult in it.", "\u201cWhen you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and -umption\u201d", "It's the phrasing. \"Need right now\". She means she's pausing her rich husband seeking for a normal guy who she has no intention of giving a real chance. Her qualifiers have been stated. The way to have a better description in her eyes is to have more money.", "As a Latina woman, I say it. Lots of people in the Latinx community use it. Just not the ones you're around.", "What did I just read?\n\nDon't use Latinx. Nobody wants to use that phrase except white liberals who think it's \"progressive\"", "I use latine/latinx, lots of people in the latinx community use it.\n\nYou probably hate using they/them as personal pronouns too, huh?\n\n\nAin't nothing wrong with being inclusive", "All my LATINO friends laugh about Latinx. Try talking to actual Latinos.\n\nYeah I think the pronouns stuff is dumb and overblown. They/them is grammatically incorrect.\n\nAlso I'm a man. Not a cis man. There are men and trans men, cis is not a thing and I consider it a slur.\n\nYou can be inclusive without throwing language rules in the trash because virtue signaling is SO important /s", "As does her flipping out on him afterwards, totally. \n\nBut OP and *a lot* of the comments seem mad about how he was described, which is odd.", "Language is literally changing all the time. \n\nShakespear added hella words to the English vernacular.\n\n\nMemes, pdfs, gifs, are all new terms.\n\n\nShit, there was controversy over implementing the use of Latino.\n\n\nI speak with people in the latinx community on a daily basis. I'm part of that community. \n\nI use the term they prefer. If they use latino/latina I use those to describe them.", "They/them is absolutely grammatically correct. You are quite wrong. And have never read Shakespeare, apparently. \n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t understand the word cis makes sense too.", "One author is not the authority for an entire language... That's not how things work.\n\nI understand cis, but I find it unnecessary and slightly offensive. I'm a man, not a cis man. A regular, biological man. If you are trans then you are a trans man, not a man."]}
