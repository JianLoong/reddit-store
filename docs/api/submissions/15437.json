But to call you unreasonable after you said you no longer wanted to, and continue to pressure you by saying he'll do breathing exercises with you if you have anxiety is creepy peer pressure hidden under the guise of an apparently caring person. I have been on hikes with many stoners and am one myself and no one has ever tried to talk anyone into doing things they don't want to.

It's also very possible that he has bad intentions and planned to drug you or worse.\n\nI never advocate ghosting but this a block and move on situation. There are enough red flags here that any attempts to explain where he went wrong, could be used to better manipulate the next woman.", "NTA. Cancel the hike. This is a bizarre reaction", "NTA \n\nI wish I could type those in bigger letters. \n\nA 5k hike is substantial, and your body needs to be operating in peak condition. Is this a flat ground hike? Or are we talking inclines, declines, rocky surfaces, water? \n\nUnless you have significant experience with edibles to know how they affect your body, and exactly which ones do and don't work for you, absolutely not a chance in hell should you be doing that. You've got your head on straight, and you're thinking smart. \n\nQuetiapine, depending on your dosage, and when you take it, can be a severe contraindication with CBD/THC (things that mix poorly and cause severe reactions).\n\nQuetiapine, as a sedative class drug, causes respiratory depression (slow down your breathing and you don't take as deep breaths). I assume your Dr has you on a low 25mg type dose if it's to help with anxiety, as it's a general calming drug. \n\nETA: the breathing exercises he's talking about have absolutely zero to do with how the Quetiapine and edibles interact together. As breathing depresses, if you reach the point where your brain is starting to send out warning signals to your body, it will incite further panic. You dont have to answer here, but if you are on any other kind of antidepressant etc, that can cause further concern. (Feel free to shoot me a mesg if you want to discuss what meds you take and how they can impact you when including things like edibles. I can fully explain how each med impacts your body and what things can alter that, make the med more or less functional etc).\n\nThe problem you run into is that many edibles can also be classed as respiratory depressants based on the content. That's where you can get into trouble. You should never combine multiple RD at once unless under the guidance of your Dr. if you don't fully understand their effects.\n\nSo, in this case, you would be using 2 things that depress your breathing while doing a strenuous activity that needs you to be able to breathe more, faster, deeper, etc. \nIe hiking is a good workout to get your heart rate and breathing up. If your lungs are being depressed and your body can't get enough oxygen while hiking, you could faint, lose consciousness, become hypoxic, etc. \n\nStand your ground about this. If he won't let it go, it's time to let him go. It should be enough for you to say, \"I'm sorry, I have other factors to consider, and I'm not willing to take the risk by including edibles in the mix\"\n\nThere are way too many hikers who get lost and injured every year because they take things like edibles, and their body reacts in a way they didn't expect. They go off course, they shut down, they freak out, and they have physical reactions within their body. It's just not safe. \n\nIf for some reason he does convince you, please please go buy your own safely from a trusted vendor in a sealed package that you open yourself. \n\nThis guy says he's OK hanging around without a relationship, even though he wants one. Maybe that's true. There are still good guys in the world who can be genuine friends, but always err on the side of safety. \n\nTo me, being out on a hike that long, I assume with no other people around, eating edibles he gives you (ie you have no idea whats in them), it just sounds too much like the start of a horror movie.", "NTA. The guy is a red flag. If you're not comfortable, you're not comfortable. Also, don't mix seroquel and edibles.\nSource: Ex mmj patient who was also on seroquel.
