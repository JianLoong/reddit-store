Mild disappointment is ok.  Full on toddler tantrum is not.  You calling him out is required, and you did so in a reasonable way  You didn't humiliate him, he did that.  Him apologizing also required.  If he doesn't get that, private father son conversation about it is required. Your doing a good thing here, just because he's about to be a father doesn't mean he's above a lesson from his father.   He can learn a lot from you.", "NTA! That comeback, though! That was great!

I mean someone failed high school biology.   \nNTA your son needs to grow up and good for you for standing up for DIL.", "NTA. Your response to your son what perfect IMHO. He has absolutely every right to feel disappointed. He was hoping for a son. I have no doubt that many many parents bave an initial disappointment. The vast majority of those parents quickly get over the disappointment and embrace the idea of a son/daughter. What your son didn't have the right to do was treat his wife like garbage and I'm glad you stood up for her! Your son also needs a biology lesson as he doesn't seem to understand that it's the man who determines the sex of the baby.", "NTA. Yikes, why would he be mad at the wife, like it\u2019s her fault. I hope he doesn\u2019t treat his daughter like crap just bc she\u2019s not a boy.", "Idk why people try so hard to validate \"gender disappointment\". It's just sexism. That's all.

That was a great response to how he was acting.", "NTA, your kid is an idiot.", "NTA\n\nYour son is giving his wife the silent treatment because the baby is a girl.

Congrats!\n\nThere should probably be a heart to heart talk soon with your son because his reaction is not acceptable. He should be excited to have a child period. Now with his reaction, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your DIL forever suspects him of not giving his daughter the full love and attention/care simply because she\u2019s a girl. He wants someone to play ball with? Teach how to fix a car? Play video games? All that can be done with a daughter. Time to let go of this fixed gender construct.", "NTA.

That shit hit hard lmao. \n\nNTA. Your son is a fucking child though.", "NTA. I think you had a perfect retort. \n\nHe is acting ridiculous. His mom and his wife are ------ TADA ------- girls. He loves them and will realize how stupid he is being once he meets his daughter. I hope his daughter never finds out what he said. If he thinks HIS feelings were hurt, just imagine. It's fine to have a preference, but most people just want a happy and healthy human. He had a temper tantrum over his future daughter. Gross.", "Your wife is telling YOU to apologise? Yikes. Is she blind to her sons blatantly abusive behaviour? Your poor DIL. \nNTA", "NTA- \"gender disappointment\" requires a lot of generalizations and assumptions (Ie prejudices) about gender. THAT is disappointing, but disappointment in the gender of a soon-to-be-born child is embarrassing and gross!", "Someone should point out to him that it's the sperm that determines the sex of the baby\nSo technically it being a girl is his fault\nAlso yes gender disappointment is real. But he needs to suck it up and grow up.!", "NTA --  also, the male is the one who determines the gender of the baby, so it's on your son to begin with", "NTA. Should tell him the males are responsible for the gender as well since he insists on giving his partner the silent treatment.", "NTA \n\nI'm not sure why your son is taking his \"disappointment\" out on others.\n\nHis wife, female has two x chromosomes. Therefore, she contributed a X chromosome to the unborn baby.\n\nYour son, male, has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.\n\nIt is his contribution that determined the biological sex of his child.\n\nBasic middle school biology.\n\nYour son is an asshole.", "NTA \n\nWell done", "NTA. I mean he can only be upset with himself since the father determines the gender of the child. I worry though how is he going to treat his daughter if he ends up with a son down the road?", "NTA. What a brilliant response. Imagine being mad at your wife for something she literally couldn't control in the first place; or being less excited for a (hopefully) healthy, happy baby just because of its gender.\n\nYour son sounds like a major AH.", "NTA. Gender disappointment is real and is ok, but acting like a spoiled child who didn't get the right color cup with lunch is not. Neither is treating his wife as if it's her fault. In fact,  *his sperm determined the sex of the baby*, so if anyone holds fault here (they don't) its him.", "NTA - of course you invalidated his feelings, because they are wrong and awful. His poor wife.", "NTA, I can only work off the assumption that since your son got someone pregnant and married them that he atleast need to be somewhat reasonably with the age range of an adult. Adults shouldn't piss and moan about things they can't control, he should be happy his wife can conceive and the child is healthy and not that his child won't have a penis.", "NTA. You put your misogynist son in his place. Good on you!!", "NTA - He can \\*feel\\* however he wants, but if he wants to \\*act\\* like a asshole he's going to be treated like an asshole.", "NTA\n\nGender disappointment is a complicated thing to begin with, but whether you think it\u2019s acceptable or not, what is not acceptable is lashing out at your pregnant wife.\n\nShe is literally using her body to create a family for them and he\u2019s giving the silent treatment because that family is starting with a daughter. He should be ashamed", "NTA, ultimately the baby you get is the one you want and you wouldn\u2019t trade them for a million of the opposite gender.", " NTA. Excellent response!", "Lol NTA and my hero.", "When I went for my ultrasound my son was not being cooperative and they couldn't find his stuff so the technician told me she thought it was a girl. We prepared ourselves with that expectation.\n\nOnce I delivered him and the doctor told me it was a boy, I was surprised, I had spent months expecting a girl. But it really didn't take long for the shock to wear off and I was just as excited to have a boy.\n\nYou are NTA but your son sure is, especially for lashing out at his pregnant wife for something that is in essence - if we want to view it that way - his fault.", "NTA- and moms coddling him, he needs to get his big big pants on and realize having a kid is 50/50 on the gender. It\u2019s like a coin flip. Your awesome tho! Pls take the DIL somewhere nice.", "NTA...you should have added that it was his chromosome that decided the gender", "Nta you are perfectly right. Gender disappointment is so stupid!!!!!", "NTA, gender disappointment is a feeling, not an action. His actions toward your DIL are completely unacceptable, and make him look like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum.", "NTA; having a girl is not an inherently reasonably valid reason for being disappointed. He is being an asshole", "NTA. You had the perfect response. If he\u2019s disappointed now, wait till he finds out it\u2019s his chromosomes that determine gender.", "NTA gender disappointment doesn\u2019t mean you have to be rude and vindictive to the mother of your child. He should be taking it out on his own sperm for that. Your response was great!", "NTA\n\nI want to hear from him how he thinks giving his wife the silent treatment was even remotely a reasonable thing. Is he blaming her? Does he not understand how biology works? \n\nLove your response. Son's mom is wrong, you owe no apology at all.", "NTA. I'm sure your DIL appreciated the light-hearted support.\n\nSeriously though, he doesn't sound mature enough to be a father. I hope he wises up before the baby comes.\n\nAlso, your son ought to know that the father is responsible for the gender of the child since he is the one with X and Y chromosomes.", "This made me laugh \ud83d\ude02 nta", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. Yes, gender disappointment is a real thing - my husband and I were hoping we were having a girl but they\u2019re a boy. We didn\u2019t do a sex reveal, just found out during an ultrasound. I was sad for that afternoon, but certainly wasn\u2019t mad at my husband or myself about it. After a year and a half of trying we\u2019re just thrilled to be having a baby and that so far all the tests have been great and he\u2019s really healthy.\n\nYour son being angry at his wife as if the baby\u2019s sex was something she could control is just asinine. He\u2019s allowed to feel his feelings but to treat her or anyone badly simply because of the baby\u2019s genitals is an asshole move.", "NTA, and I am not sure why he is lashing out as his wife for the Gender of the baby. The males sperm is what determines the gender if anyone is to blame for him not getting the son he wanted it's him and his balls that decided they wanted a girl", "NTA- I\u2019d be disappointed in finding out my son was a misogynist too.", "NTA\n\nAnd you might remind him that the sperm decides the sex, not the egg so it has nothing to do with the poor woman whose realizing what kind of man she\u2019s married to", "NTA. His embarrassing behavior brought on OP\u2019s embarrassing but pretty innocuous comment.", "NTA. I think this was a nice response to the way your son was behaving. Light-hearted, yet direct. Hopefully your son sees how ridiculous he was acting.", "NTA\n\nNow this is where his wife should come in and ask how he feels and when he says mad at your comment she can tell him she feels the same way about him. I mean, if it\u2019s good for the goose and all.", "NTA. The son was practically asking for it.", "NTA. He's a misogynist and one who didn't pay attention in science class.\n\nThe father (XY chromosomes) determines the sex of the baby not the woman (XX). If he needs to 'blame' someone because his child is already a disappointment, he should blame himself.", "NTA. He can feel how he feels. When it crosses the line into nasty treatment towards the woman CARRYING HIS BABY, it\u2019s gone too far and deserves to be called out.", "NTA.\n\nYes, gender disappointment *is* a thing. But it's not an excuse to turn into a miserable human being. He's blaming his wife for something beyond her control and it sounds like he's going to take it out on his daughter, too. That's not \"disappointment,\" the behavior on display here comes from a level of oblivious selfishness bordering on a psychological disorder. Like, I can't even fathom what a d\\*ck he's being.\n\nI don't know how you managed to be so kind to him, but if it's that severe, he really should be seeking treatment. If nothing else, his marriage isn't likely to survive the birth of his child if he doesn't get over himself.", "NTA.  I got a good chuckle out of it all.  And why is he giving your DIL the silent treatmen?.  He knows HE is the one that determined this lil ol gender, right??? lol", "NTA and giving his wife silent treatment is just ironic, since it is biologically his \u201cfault\u201d, that his baby\u2019s gonna be girl \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA. Gender disappointment does not give you an excuse to act like a child and treat a pregnant woman like crap. She did nothing wrong. He\u2019s the one that determines the gender so he should be mad at himself. Good for you standing up to him. Your wife needs to stop coddling him and excusing his behavior. His poor wife. If he doesn\u2019t shape up she will leave him. And honestly she should, I\u2019d be worried he\u2019d treat his daughter badly because she wasn\u2019t a boy.", "NTA. Your son is being rude and disrespectful to his wife and future daughter. Thank you for standing up for them.", "NTA\n \nDon\u2019t have children if you\u2019re going to be disappointed.\n\nBesides, gender is determined by the father\u2019s genetic contribution so he\u2019s the cause of his own disappointment.", "NTA - only thing disappointing is his behavior", "NTA thank you for your very reasonable response to an idiot who is hurting everyone around him.", "NTA - I never get why guys (most of the times) are disappointed over the gender of their kids. And what a hilarious comeback!", "NTA. thanks for sticking up for you daughter in law. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s giving her the silent treatments over this. He does realize HIS own sperm decided the gender right??? We ladies just have X chromosomes eggs.", "NTA- great response!\n\nHe needs to grow up and your comment hopefully hits a nerve and gives him a kick in the ass.\n\nI've always wanted a little boy and my partner wanted a girl. When I was pregnant and we found out it was a boy, instead of getting upset or pulling the same shit as your son, he just laughed and went \"you won!\" then got excited about matching t-shirts. We were both just happy to be able to have a child, regardless of gender. Your son's reaction is ridiculous, if my partner had reacted the same way and tried to give his pregnant partner the silent treatment, we'd be single and co-parenting... totally unacceptable. It's fine to be a little disappointed, but he's taking the piss and doesn't give great hope for you he's going to handle the other stresses, disappointments, arguments, sleepless nights and other hardships of parenthood that he's about to face, really hope he gets his act together!", "Every time I see a man so insanely disappointed that his child will be a girl, I feel the immerse need to point out to him that it is his fault, because sperm is what determines gender \u2620\ufe0f. Anyway NTA. \"Gender disappointment\" is just sexism and dehumanizing girls in disguise and Its about time it gets called out. Myb not just girls but I have honestly never seen gender disappointment over a boy thats as extreme as it is for the girls, Its either dads losing their shit or toxic boy moms. Hoping for one gender slightly above the other is not the same as lashing out and having meltdowns over your baby's gender.", "NTA \n\nWhere did he learn to be a misogynist?", "DEFINITELY NTA. He acted like it was his wife\u2019s fault they were having a girl. Those sentiments should have ended when science was able to determine who\u2019s DNA decides the sex of the baby and it\u2019s the man. Good for you to point out his behavior wasn\u2019t acceptable. That\u2019s your son\u2019s real problem I would bet is that you didn\u2019t do the \u201cgood ol\u2019 boys\u201d stance of blaming the woman. He was hoping that you \u201cmen\u201d would stick together and shame his wife!", "NTA, that comeback couldn\u2019t have been better had it been scripted. Gender disappointment is, obviously, definitely a thing that happens. He;s not automatically an asshole for having a preference and feeling some stuff about it. But he;s severely crossed the line by essentially punishing his wife over something she has zero control over, and giving himself permission to behave like this baby is now unwanted. That\u2019s incredibly juvenile, like whatever he feels he has a right to act out on. Tell him that if he\u2018s hurt by what you said, then that\u2019s him invalidating your own feelings of disappointment and not allowing you the space to express them in whatever fashion you choose. Two can play that game.", "Just remind him that he was the donor of the other X chromosome\u2026. The fault lies within himself.", "NTA. Some feelings, like being so disappointed in the gender of your child that you ignore your wife or otherwise lashing out at people, **absolutely deserve to be invalidated.** He's not experiencing valid emotions, he's abusing his wife for being pregnant with the wrong gender of child. Which is biologically his \"fault\" anyway.", "Absolutely excellent reply!  Well said OP\n\nNTA obviously", "Good for you. He needed to hear that but it probably won't do any good. NTA", "NTA You sound like a good dad, something your son will likely Not become with such a bad start and shitty archaic attitude", "NTA, so he can be a dick to his wife bcz they\u2019re having a baby (in no way any of desiring) and not like a baby that hasn\u2019t done anything, but you can\u2019t be dissatisfied/disappointed in a son being a dick to his family\u2026 lol tf", "NTA. I\u2019d be proud of you were my spouse.", "NTA. Your point was very well made. Parental disappointment should come from their behavior, not from their gender. Your wife needs to get over the fact that your son is upset, since he is in the wrong here.", "NTA... like I'm worried for that little girl.  Not even born yet and is \"dad\" going to resent her?  At least we know mom and granddad will love the bejesus outta her.", "NTA. Once he cools down, talk to him about how that made him feel, then ask him how he supposes his wife felt at his reaction. \n\nAnd tell him if he ever gives your granddaughter the slighted inkling that he is disappointed that she's a girl, he's not too old for you to take him over your knee.", "LOL  NTA.\n\nLook, you can hope for your baby to be a certain sex and have feelings about what their sex actually turns out to be. What you *can't* do is lash out at people because of it, because that's some childish bullshit. \n\nYour comeback was ace, good work.", "\u201cHe was upset and was giving her the silent treatment and lashing out at the slightes attempt to speak to him.\u201d\n\nMy brain blipped a second reading this and thought the son in question must be a 2-year-old wanting a younger brother for this to make any sense. Still not great behavior for a 2-year-old, but at least more understandable coming from someone who lacks the brain development to regulate their emotions.\n\nSo no, you didn\u2019t mess up, your son did for behaving worse than a 2-year-old. When you have a baby, you sign up for the kid that you get. Your son needs to check his attitude ASAP or he\u2019s going to traumatize his little girl.\n\nNTA.", "Excellent comment imparting wisdom. Give him time to think about what you meant.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you didn't invalidate his feelings, you gave him a stern talking to about growing the f*ck up.", "NTA\n\nMost times (I know there are exceptions), \"gender disappointment\" is directed to (future) daughters. In some parts of the world the disappointment doesn't stop at words, sadly. It's just misogyny with a nicer word.\n\nPlus the way he treats his pregnant wife after the announcement?? The one who is doing the actually hard part for having a baby?

Excellent analysis, by the way.", "I guess since son appeared shocked he expected a more \"sympathetic\" reaction from his parents.

You'll be sleeping on the couch for sure!\"", "I mean, I can understand being a little deflated if you've dreamed of having a kid of one sex and it turns out to be the opposite. I've heard of this quite frequently in that it can be a bit of an adjustment to change your expectations of what raising your child would be like. A friend of mine always wanted to have a little girl but ended up with three sons -- who she of course loves and is an excellent parent to! But she admits having a little cry at the ultrasound, especially for their last kid.\n\nOf course, the lashing out at his partner in this instance is extremely inappropriate and misogynistic, particularly since it's the sperm that decides the sex! \n\nI love OP's response, he is definitely NTA.", "Especially since the sex is determined by the sperm.

The kid will be who they are.  If you are upset because of the baby is the \u201cwrong\u201d gender and you think they won\u2019t be interested in doing the same things you are think again.  You could pray to have a girly girl daughter, but they might like rolling in the mud & climbing trees.  You might want a son that plays sports, but they might like baking or sewing.

The son is an asshole, we all agree, case closed, gavel slammed.\n\nI'm a straight dude who for whatever reason always had a problem relating to other guys when I was younger. As I got older I ended up with a few really close male friends... but mostly I get along with girls. I always envisioned myself having little girls. Am I saying I would have been disappointed with a little boy? No... but it's not what I saw when I looked into my crystal ball.\n\nAs it turns out I ended up with two little girls. And believe me when I say you're right that \"sex of a child has nothing to do with what their personality and interests will be or what you can do with them\". I do a whole helluva lot of \"boy things\" (I hate that concept, but you'll know what I mean) with my little girls in addition to a whole helluva lot of \"girl things\". \n\nBut as somebody who saw himself with little girls.... I don't know exactly what I would have felt if the doc said it was a boy. And so, I just like to give people space for all their feelings when they aren't being assholes. The son lost his right to have whatever feelings he had validated when he treated the person cooking a human for him like crap.", "as someone who grew up with a shitty dad, but an amazing grandpa, my thoughts exactly!", "And someone sympathetic to the baby's mother, able to provide support.", "The nice thing is someone will gleefully tell her grandad's absolute zinger so she knows she's always had support", "Same.  My Dad had 4 daughters and he is still disappointed over 60 years later.", "As someone currently expecting a little boy, it was a little bit of a shock to me yes. If I had a daughter I think we'd be able to do a wider range of things. With a son I have to acknowledge I'm perfectly ok with what ever his interests are but he'll also very likely face a lot of social pressure and bullying if he shows an interest in 'girly' things. It's socially acceptable for girls to like more traditionally boy things but not for boys to like traditionally girly things. \n\nPlus so many of the little boy focused groups I'm familiar with from when my nephew was younger tended very much to high pressure dad's trying to live vicariously though their sons and made things really unfair or difficult for all the kids (see the dad's who show up with things they made at what's supposed to be an kid contests).  And I'm excited as heck to meet the little guy  but I'm definitely worried about him getting harassed and bullied and honestly I'm not looking forward to a lot of the little boy culture dynamics.", "I feel all of that. My little girls have Ninja Turtle thermoses but God forbid I ever told anyone I had She-Ra dolls. I am fortunate my Dad was not like that and that I found my people. But ya, being a little boy can be tough.\n\nThat said, I see a lot of hope in my daughter's generation and a lot of little boys who are a lot more accepted for who they are now. Congratulations and best wishes on that journey."]}
