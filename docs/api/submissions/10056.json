My eldest \u201cGia\u201d is 28 years old. About 5 years ago, she moved about 90 minutes away to live with her boyfriend, \u201cMarco\u201d. They\u2019ve since had 2 girls that are 4 & 1.\n\nMy younger daughter, \u201cAlexis\u201d (17F) has is both mentally and physically disabled. While she is somewhat independent, she\u2019ll never live alone and requires quite a bit of care. When my oldest granddaughter was born, Gia kept hinting that I should come visit and help with her. I did come down a couple of times but Alexis\u2019 health was pretty poor at that point, so that had to be my focus. \n\nEventually, Gia confided in me that Marco didn\u2019t help with the baby at all. I sympathized. As time went on, things didn\u2019t get better. I was surprised when Gia told me  she was trying to conceive #2. I asked if Marco was doing better and she said no, but he really wanted to try to for a boy. It\u2019s her life and her business so I let it go. Sure enough, nothing changed when my youngest granddaughter was born.\n\nAround this time, my cousin passed. I was left the guardian of her 2 year old daughter, \u201cEvelyn\u201d. Juggling Evelyn and Alexis is no easy task, and I\u2019m also doing it alone. I have never asked my older kids for help and never would. \n\nThis past year, Gia keeps hinting that I should come down more. I have a couple times but usually end up saying, it\u2019d be easier for her to come to me. \n\nRecently, Gia blew up at me saying she has no help and as her mother, I should. I said I\u2019m a little busy myself with one special needs child and a toddler who went through trauma. I\u2019m always there emotionally but I can\u2019t physically. She said that Marco is no help and I said she knew what she was getting into this time around. It\u2019s not up to everyone else to support her. She got mad and told me I was insensitive.  \n\n\nI was talking to my sister and she said I went too far.

She made her decisions whereas your younger daughter and niece did not, you are not the AH, you sound like a caring mother who lets her child make her own decisions and you are 100% right, she knew what she was getting into with the 2nd and it's on her to figure out how to deal with it.", "Nta \nShe needs to take Marco to marriage counciling and she is not entitled to have you solve her problems. She needs to grow up.", "INFO: in the past seventeen years, when was the last time Gia had your undivided time and attention? As Gia is the oldest, how often had she to trivialize her needs in favour of her younger siblings?\n\nTo me it seems, that Gia asked you to make her a priority this once, and is told again you don't have the time to look after her needs, as you need to be looking after the care of others and that maybe is why she is upset with you.", "YTA but you certainly do not sound like an AH. You sound like a caring mother who loves her kids but can only handle so much. Telling her what you did was 100% percent too far, and not nice, but not something that can't be healed as time goes on. On one condition, which I'll get to.\n\nRemember she is one of your children. NOT another random adult in the world. Telling her you don't have time may make *logical* sense, but to a child of any age, be aware that some of that may translate to \"I favor the other child over you.\"  or \"I do not value you as much as...\"\n\nThis is hard to take, especially if she is at her wits end with no support. Did you have support when you had your kids? You must know how it feels either way.\n\nSmart of you to ask how she wants number two when number one is too much to handle. It sounds like in her young mind, two babies might make the man see sense and pull his weight.\n\nWe all know that will not happen. She's young. \n\nSo, the condition: I would definitely apologize and then listen to her vent for a while. At the end, tell her you love her. Good way to end that convo.\n\nThen try to come up with solutions about how she can get child care done, that don't involve you. She needs some support.  Try to work on that with her, **as a team** to show you care. Even if you don't see a solution or know right now you just simply do not have the resources.\n\nIt is your duty as a parent. If you are not prepared to do that, do not tell ***her that she got herself into it.***\n\nYou can see what I'm saying.", "Definitely NTA. You\u2019re right. She knew exactly what she was signing up for the second time around and she did it anyways. I\u2019m not sure why she thought trying for a boy would fix anything. At best it sounds like she was hoping he would play fun dad to the boy which is honestly worse. She needs to wake up.", "NTA\nYou did not go too far and maybe not far enough. Gia has a husband who could help with their kids. You tried to warn her. Good luck.", "NTA.. I hope Gia doesn't fall for \"trying for a boy\" again... I mean clearly Marco is a tad misogynistic", "NTA", "NTA- you spoke the facts- truth hurts baby!", "NTA, tell her to put on her grown girl panties and get her lazy bum of a boyfriend to be a father for their children, sorry you have to go through all this.", "NTA", "Kudos to you.  You are trying.  You have your hands full.  U fortunately your daughter chose an \u201cabsent\u201dfather and then thought it may change with baby 2.   It\u2019s unfortunate but she is an adult and 28 at that", "NTA She needs to redirect her issue to the husband.", "NTA. Make babies with useless partners, and expect to suffer. You very much have your hands full where you are.", "NTA this is on her husband and you are working your ass off good for you", "NTA so hard. It's her child and she is responsible for her own. While you are responsible for your own i.e. Alexis and now Evelyn.\n\nWhat you said to her is completely correct. she had a second child knowing full well her husband wasn't going to provide help.", "Yeah, I find myself feeling impatient with women who have a baby with a man who ends up doing jack, then decide to have more kids with the same deadbeat. I want to ask \"Why?!\" Do they think the guy will suddenly change and morph into Super Dad? Please.", "Exactly - there are plenty of grandparents who aren't in a position to help out, that doesn't mean a lack of love  or care (although depressingly that can be the case) but more often, as with OP, a lack of resources. OP literally does not have the time or energy to spare on the grandkids.\n\nMarco, on the other hand? Dead weight, and Gia needs to ditch him yesterday. Then she'll have child support and more free time (because she won't be running after him).", "Looks like there\u2019s a good 10-11yr age gap between them so would depend on how much attention she got then\u2026", "I disagree.  It's not OP's duty as a parent to do any such thing.  Her duty ended when she advised her daughter against using another baby to try to fix her broken marriage.  We each only have so much bandwidth, and OP has two minor children she's responsible for before anything else. \n\nOP understands, as any good mom would, that the literal children in her care trump some adult woman's mismanaged household.  Expecting anything more than that, given OP's situation, is just incredibly selfish on the daughter's part to even ask for.  If anything, she should be leaving her kids with their father so she can offer her single mother some respite.", "I think people should get a one time pass in not knowing shit, we don't come out the womb as fully functioning adults and if you don't know some stuff well maybe you weren't shown how so okay, here's your opportunity to learn.\n\nIf after that you still don't know (or pretend not to know) and show no willingness to even bother attempting then yes that's in deadbeat territory and I'd be questioning the wisdom of going through the same process with this person and expecting things to be different.", "And isn't that the definition of insanity - repeating the same behavior over and over yet expecting different results?", "Apparently for many men, growing a dick took up so much brain energy that as adults they can't possibly learn how to run a washer and dryer. /s\n\nNote that my male partner isn't one of those men, nor does he need me to tell him what needs doing.  I'd not be with him if he were.", "I am so sorry that your oldest child turned out as an idiot despite your efforts. You sound like a good, reasonable, fair mom. NTA you are right, she knew what she signed up for. If someone doesn't look after the first, they won't do it for the second either.", "right? my bf right now is amazing and does his fair share of chores. he just cleaned the kitchen tonight. i didnt have to ask or nag, and i was honeslty expecting to do it myself tomorrow. its not an impossibility, society has just conditioned women to not trust their male partners with being able to do anything. weaponized incompetence has a societal basis", "The word you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t asshole it\u2019s hero.", "NTA", "Is she dense? Marco is at fault. She let him put a 2nd baby in her\u2026\u2026wtf. Open her eyes. You did nothing wrong. She\u2019s not aware that she made decisions that have consequences. NTA.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIs Gia getting no help from her lived-in sperm donor *because* they have had girls so far? Is this going to change if they try for number 3, get a boy, AND THEN Marco gets involved with the child care? If so, that would only prove that Marco is a sexist AH and not just a regular one. I hope Gia doesn't try to find out.", "NTA.  \nShe has a husband. Taking care of his kids is partly his responsibility. Not your fault that he's useless. She's the one that married him.", "NTA -  she's an adult.  Its time to grow up.  Parents are not responsible for taking care of their grandkids.", "NTA\n\nA support network is really important for you AND Gia now.  Gia sounds like she is pretty deep in her own problems because she cannot see the depth of your needs and commitment to your other daughter and your niece.  It sounds like you can support Gia some, but Gia will need to take a hand in this by coming to your house.\n\nIt does sound like Gia and Marco are not married.  In reaching to make a deeper or better relationship, she decided, yes, another child would be a good idea, with a man who does not commit to her, or to helping her as she was at that moment.\n\nYou are right, Gia made a choice many people would have avoided, and she cannot see how much time and effort your current and very real commitments take.\n\nBe firm in explaining your situation, and gentle but persistent in explaining that you cannot give Gia much support in her house or location, now, and for the foreseeable future.\n\nGood luck", "> She got mad and told me I was insensitive.\n\nInsensitive? Like telling your mother of two, who is once again raising a child to adulthood due to a tragedy, whilst balancing a disabled nearly adult daughter, all while her eldest daughter whines about how she can't do what her mother is doing alone? Yeah, couldn't imagine being that \"insensitive.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Info : has your adult daughter some mental defect ? Because there's no excuse, we are in 2023, she is na adult. If her husband doesn't help her, she should take a look at the mirror and not take it out on you. I'm getting sick of people like this, with trash*y partners, but stay with them.", "NTA The problem is her husband, not you. She should never, ever have had a 2nd kid with a guy who wouldn't lift a finger to help with the first.\n\nDid you ask of she has any friends who can help? If he's isolating her this may be an abusive relationship, and you should try to help her find resources to get away from him.", "NTA.  She isn't married to you, she is married to her husband.  You are not the father of the two kids, her husband is the father.  If she wants help, she can get mad at her useless husband.  You have no time for this nonsense.  She chose to have two kids with him.  It's their problem.", "Jeez, seriously. OP has AT LEAST as much on her plate as her daughter does, if not more. What in the world does she want from her? What is OP supposed to do with her own responsibilities while she takes off to go help her daughter? And if OP brings both children with her to her daughter's, I don't see how that would be very helpful to her daughter. It would create a houseful of chaos.", "Which is just so hard to understand nowadays. It\u2019s no longer the case where when you have a boy, the family name is definitely carried on or any of that nonsense. And then this case, having a boy wouldn\u2019t help at all because Margo isn\u2019t going to all of a sudden decide he wants to change diapers and help out with child care because he has a boy.", "The men like Marco are entirely lazy and believing they\u2019re going to change is just foolish.", "[removed]", "Your daughter is stupid. She loves the idea of the funny Marco it was at the beginning of the relationship. What is there to love about Marco now", "My FMIL is a lot of things, but I will say, she did not let her boys get away with doing nothing. My fiance has been cleaning and taking care of shit his entire life, just like all of his brothers and sisters.\n\nHer mother forced her and her sisters to clean up after and basically serve the men in their family. When she got married and had her own kids, she wasn't going to let that happen to her kids. Caused a lot of fights with fiance's bio dad. I super respect her for that, because it's not easy to break the cycle of abuse by yourself and it led to my fiance being a fully capable individual. If anything, fiance has had to take care of me the last couple of years because of a series of unfortunate events (doctors putting me on the wrong meds which made me crazy, super awful asthma issues because of lack of building safety and the world catching on fire, I got run over by an idiot on a scooter the other week, etc).\n\nEither way, we're together because he's fully capable, and for as much shit as I've recently gone through, so am I.\n\nI'm glad we're starting to normalize men being equal partners in some societies.", "Huh? Why are you talking like you are the OP?", "Bad Bot! This comment was stolen from one of OP's comments", "Got 'em", "Bot. I reported the same account on another post. Going to report them here."]}
