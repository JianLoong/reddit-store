My eldest \u201cGia\u201d is 28 years old. About 5 years ago, she moved about 90 minutes away to live with her boyfriend, \u201cMarco\u201d. They\u2019ve since had 2 girls that are 4 & 1.\n\nMy younger daughter, \u201cAlexis\u201d (17F) has is both mentally and physically disabled. While she is somewhat independent, she\u2019ll never live alone and requires quite a bit of care. When my oldest granddaughter was born, Gia kept hinting that I should come visit and help with her. I did come down a couple of times but Alexis\u2019 health was pretty poor at that point, so that had to be my focus. \n\nEventually, Gia confided in me that Marco didn\u2019t help with the baby at all. I sympathized. As time went on, things didn\u2019t get better. I was surprised when Gia told me  she was trying to conceive #2. I asked if Marco was doing better and she said no, but he really wanted to try to for a boy. It\u2019s her life and her business so I let it go. Sure enough, nothing changed when my youngest granddaughter was born.\n\nAround this time, my cousin passed. I was left the guardian of her 2 year old daughter, \u201cEvelyn\u201d. Juggling Evelyn and Alexis is no easy task, and I\u2019m also doing it alone. I have never asked my older kids for help and never would. \n\nThis past year, Gia keeps hinting that I should come down more. I have a couple times but usually end up saying, it\u2019d be easier for her to come to me. \n\nRecently, Gia blew up at me saying she has no help and as her mother, I should. I said I\u2019m a little busy myself with one special needs child and a toddler who went through trauma. I\u2019m always there emotionally but I can\u2019t physically. She said that Marco is no help and I said she knew what she was getting into this time around. It\u2019s not up to everyone else to support her. She got mad and told me I was insensitive.  \n\n\nI was talking to my sister and she said I went too far.

Your daughter should be having a conversation with Marco about the fact that she is doing almost all of the work for these children. And she is an adult. She had a second child with a man she knew wasn\u2019t helpful or frankly a decent father ( a decent father pitches in with child care ). You\u2019re also a single mother in a very difficult situation, and the burden of looking after your grandchildren cannot fall on your shoulders. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the most. You can in a difficult situation.", "NTA.

You could reach out to organizations for help with special needs children.  \n\nGood luck to both of you.  Your sister is wrong.", "NTA.\n\nits not like shes an impressionable 16 yr old.

You told her the truth, as hard as it was for her to hear.  It doesn\u2019t sound like life is easy for you either as you have your younger daughter and a toddler to take care of.

Keep your head up you\u2019re doing a great job!!!!", "NTA. She did know what she was getting into and she made a choice that already bit her in the ass once and did it again anyway.

You're responsible for your own kids and she's responsible for hers.  The fact that she doesn't recognize that you have so much on your plate, shows that she is self absorbed.  She needs to work on getting her husband to help more and stop trying to guilt you into helping her.", "NTA - Usually I am yelling at parents who expect their older kids to take care of their younger ones but this time it is the reverse.  You are right - your daughter chose to have those kids with a man who is useless.   She needs to get her life together - either get rid of the man or hire some help or both....  It is not your responsibility to raise her kids.", "NTA she is blaming and getting angry with you because it\u2019s easier than addressing the actual problem.", "You are NTA.

People make mistakes, and I would offer my daughter like a room in my home if I had one if I was in your situation. But that\u2019s about it.
