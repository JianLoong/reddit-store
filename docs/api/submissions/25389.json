I had attempted to bring up her hygiene to her gently but every time she would cry and shut down the conversation even when I would offer her help.

The second place where Ruby lived, her roommates were very unclean and it seems that she picked up some of their habits there.

I know sometimes menstrual cycles can\u2019t be controlled, but she could still likely do something to somewhat control it (wear a max tampon and use a heavy absorbant pad along with it). That should likely control her period. And if not, she should likely start talking to a doctor about what\u2019s going on. You\u2019ve tried talking to her about it and she\u2019s not responsive to your very valid concerns. So at this point you just have to tell Ruby that she\u2019s no longer allowed to ride in your car until she can control what\u2019s going on.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t let her in the car either. She sounds like she needs psychiatric help.", "NTA. You sound very reasonable. I hope someone can get through to her to find out what\u2019s going on.", "NTA she can walk or bleed on the bus. Periods are normal. Not dealing with them such that you're a walking biohazard one week a month is severely abnormal. If she's \"too busy\" to reimburse you for the cost to clean your seats, she can take an Uber. Don't let this woman back in your car until she deals with her outrageously poor hygiene.", "NTA. This is bloody disgusting. \n\nDid she move voluntarily from her parents? Or did she move on her own accord?\nSounds like something happened in her personal life that caused her to enter this downwards going spiral", "NTA - but let me ask you. Wouldn\u00b4t it be easier to ask her to sit on a towel/cover rather than not getting her in your car anymore?   \n\n\nYou have every reason to say that on three occasions you had her menstrual blood on your passenger seat and even needed to dry clean it, so if she wants to join you, she either takes care of her hygiene, or sit on a blanket, otherwise she can\u00b4t ride with you?", "NAH. Sounds like a major depressive episode on her part. And by \"major\" I mean the type that's diagnosible by a psychiatrist. She needs help.", "NTA. Your friend may have some mental health, or just health issues as well.  You're in an awfully difficult place there, since it is so difficult to even engage with R.  You might just try placing towels on the seats, over plastic when you are driving her.", "NTA- I\u2019d tell her it\u2019s either sit on a towel, or no ride. No compromises", "NTA. It happening once is an accident, but repeatedly isn't ok.", "NTA, I would cut her out of my life honestly.

She can't just continue ignoring the issue.", "I have asked her before to sit on a towel but she just said she didn't want to and that it was too embarrassing", "Let's not pretend hygiene is some incredibly complex and difficult thing to do. This isn't an request to smell like roses at every turn, but taking care of bodily functions. Take this to the extreme, if a friend shows up, covered in urine and wants to get a ride? Unless you have a really fucking good reason, you are not coming near anything I own.", "Yeah. I hear that. But sometimes people change so much that they are really just a drain on your energy. And it sounds like she's not in a place to accept your help.", "Maybe it's time for an intervention. Sitting on a towel is embarassing, but taking a shower isn't? Is she struggling to make ends meet? Enough so that she can't afford feminine hygiene products? It sounds like you care about this friend, I would try to bridge this conversation and ask.", "Tell her it's more embarrassing to explain to mutual friends you picked up, that they chose to sit in the back after seeing her period blood stains.

This will keep your seats clean. And then kindly ask Ruby if she needs help buying pads/tampons or whatever she uses. She clearly is struggling and suffering in a way that I know nothing about. I think cutting all contact with a friend who is in a vulnerable situation is not the kindest thing to do.", "NTA. Stop giving her rides. There's nothing you can do about her personal hygiene, she may be depressed, but you can ban her from your car.", "NTA Puppy pads. If you don\u2019t want to ban her from her car, lay down puppy pads and ensure that they are used.

You dont just free bleed in people car. Disgusting.", "Well your options then would be to decline her being in your car, to have a stack of old clean towels for her to sit on (and if she cries for being singled out, you have to be firm and say that you\u2019re being nice - you didn\u2019t ask her to pay the cleaning fee.

Just wondering bc not caring about hygiene ESPECIALLY when bleeding is a red flag... (No pun intended).", "NAH, period blood is gross and it makes total sense that you don't want a repeat of that, but trust me when I say that sometimes even a pad + tampon combo can fail if you have a real heavy flow. and That's not even taking into account the possibility that she has an irregular pattern because of hormonal birth control", "Just scrolled and saw your comment, I also wonder the same...", "NTA\n\nBut I would encourage you to encourage Ruby to see a therapist. Sounds like she has some major depression.", "Ruby is still the AH though. If she had no idea she was doing this, she would get a pass. But she has been told. She has been offered free hygiene products. She refuses them. She has been offered a towel to sit on. She refuses it. She is willfully and intentionally bleeding on OP'S seats after OP has asked her not to. She is an AH. And yes, I have been diagnosed with severe depression that I had for years. And yes, depression definitely affects your hygiene. BUT it does not make it impossible to sit on a frickin towel, come on"]}
