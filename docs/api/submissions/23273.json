As someone who was always blamed by a narcissist, no matter how much it was her own fault, I always just brushed it off. I knew it was not my fault, but in the end, did she? In her mind, was it a temporary solution to ease the tension when she made a mistake, or was I truly the worst person to exist?", "what a thoughtful and helpful comment. agree with everything in the comment, and can confirm that verbal/emotional/psychological abuse can be as bad or worse than physical. your responses to her were level-headed and considerate. \n\nbut it also does seem like you\u2019re walking on eggshells around her and that is no way to live. i can\u2019t even suggest to you that you should stand up for yourself more, bc there could be backlash/consequences for that. a good therapist will be able to help you gain perspective of your situation and navigate your path forward. in every way, NTA.", "You're welcome, I'm really glad I could help a bit!

You shouldn't have to be on high alert, trying your best to avoid upsetting them. \n\nIt's not your job to be her emotional punching bag.\n\nOn a side note, I shared that link elsewhere today, and someone commented that it saved them.

I don't think I've ever seen or heard of a narcissist who would rescind their accusations after the fact, after the tension has subsided.", "Thats what I was worried about too.
