Both his beard and hair are around waist level, and are not particularly well kept. Most people who see it would likely assume he is homeless or in a cult. He has looked like this for a couple years and everyone we know (aside from him and his wife) think it's unattractive and creepy.\n\nThis is an office professional workplace, and a position that involves frequent interactions with the general public. The handbook doesn't specifically state exact hair or beard lengths, but it does say appearance should be neat and professional. So I told him (and his wife) that while he doesn't need to entirely cut off his beard or hair, he does need to trim at least a little off.\n\nWell, his wife is absolutely outraged I dare even ask such a thing. She compared it to asking a fat person to lose weight, to ask a Muslim to cut his beard (which I don't think is actually a part of Islam, but whatever), forcing a trans-person to wear clothes that does not match their gender-identity, etc. She says 'If a 12 inch beard is OK, why isn't a 3 foot long beard?' I reply, the recipe says a teaspoon of salt, so ofcourse 5 cups of salt is OK.\n\nShe accused me of pretending it is company policy when it's actually about my personal disagreement with his appearance. While it's true that I have been open about how awful his beard appears, it's also true that the company does have a policy about appearing professional. And having a three foot long untamed, thin, dry, crispy beard is hard to justify as professional.\n\nOn the one hand my sister-in-law claims this is a part of his identity and reflects his self image, and on the other hand my brother claims he appears this way because he does not care about his appearance. I'm more inclined to believe him than her. I tried to explain that he could cut half his beard off and he'd still have an extremely long beard that matches his identity. But she's still absolutely offended.\n\nTo be honest, I think she cares more about proving a point than what's actually best for my brother's health.

That being said I do understand suggesting it to him to ensure he\u2019s able to keep his job.

The simplest route to take would be to chat with him one on one and in your own words make the point that the company may not keep him around if he doesn\u2019t clean up a bit but that it is not your decision to make and that you do not personally care what he does and that it\u2019s coming from a place of love to give him a heads up. \n\nTLDR; if you told him he had to do it YTA , if you politely recommended it then NTA.", "Inless you will be his direct manager,  YTA.

If someone approaches you to try to correct it, tell them you already tried. And leave it alone. If he changes the culture and is allowed to keep it, great.
