Not a great guy there. You'll be better off without him back in your life.", "NTA\n\nFrom the sound of it, you've done nothing to lead Ted on or in any way indicate that if he did leave his wife, you'd be open to a relationship with him.  That's Ted and his ego believing that any person he's interested in MUST be eager to be with him.  So if Ted leaves his wife for you without any indication from you that you'd be willing to take him, that's 100% on Ted and a mess of his own making.  He should not assume that someone who has not had contact with him in years is harboring deep feelings for HIM just because he's still hung up on them.  \n\nLet Ted do Ted.  And if Ted makes messes for himself, let Ted clean those up.  Ted sounds like a TON of drama and ego, quite frankly, and you'd be an AH to yourself if you got yourself back involved with his nonsense instead of firmly maintaining a boundary that sounds like it has been healthy and served you well.", "There is no conflict here, this hasnt happened.", "YWNTBA and please be careful. He doesn't sound very stable, and I worry for your safety. You have no reason to stay in contact with him at all.", "NTA.  He's not coming, you're just the stick he's threatening his wife with.  If he does show? It's just that, a show for his wife.  Don't fall for any of this.", "NTA. You\u2019re not into Ted, you\u2019ve made it clear you\u2019re not into Ted. If he leaves his wife for you that\u2019s ridiculous, because you\u2019re NOT INTERESTED. It\u2019s not your fault. That\u2019s on Ted", "NTA. One-sided things like that can turn into obsessions. Best to crush his romantic hopes right now.", "NTA, he will use you and spit you out mark my words. Run while you can!", "What did I just read... are you serious right now?", "NTA - you don't owe anyone anything, sometimes you just need to keep that door shut and locked.", "*Of course* you are NTA.
