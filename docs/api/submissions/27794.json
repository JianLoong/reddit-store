That\u2019s about as close to a \u201cconversation\u201d as you are having with your cat when you meow at him.  Yes, cats meow at humans as a form of communication, but they don't expect or want humans to meow back, they want your attention, they want you to feed them, give them attention, etc. By meowing back you're most likely frustrating him, which encourages more meowing. If you stop meowing, and otherwise meet his needs, eventually his meowing will become less insistent. Talking  affectionately to him in a normal human voice would satisfy him more than meowing and be less annoying to humans around you.", "INFO:  how much is this happening?

I'm assuming they're not accustomed to vocal animals, and cat meows can be somewhat shrill, especially when repeated back and forth with a human. So I can understand why they see it as a simple request that is not being fulfilled.\n\nI don't want to assume that they are just being an asshole, because it's very possible they could just be having sensory issues. Certain noises are really grating to me and make me irritable, give me headaches, and even make me anxious. I would prefer people not make those noises around me if I have told them that it is triggering in that way, and I would find it disrespectful if someone I cared about did it regardless. However, I also don't think you should have to change your relationship with your cat, especially since it could be distressing for the cat, and it would take a bit of fun out of your life I'm sure. All that to say, it might be worth investigating if there's a deeper issue for your partner there, and looking into solutions like headphones or ear plugs.\n\nYou should also probably explain to them (if you haven't already) that you really can't train your cat to stop with the meowing, because that's just a natural cat behavior and it could be distressing for him.\n\nIf your partner is generally kind and respectful to both you and your cat, and only has issues with the noise, I don't think either of you are being assholes here. At worst you're slightly incompatible when it comes to noise, and you two just need to communicate and find a solution.", "I seriously don't know wth is happening to people with all these comments.

That's not your partner setting a boundary; that's your partner trying to control your behavior and very possibly jealous of the cat.  Which isn't a good look for a human.\n\nSounds like you've got a lovely, interactive kitty.  Keep meowing.

There is no teaching a cat not to meow. You can either handle it, or you can\u2019t. NTA, continue with your kitty convos!", "NTA - your cat is a cat, he/you can't properly communicate in any significant way and thus you can't explain to him he needs to stop. Ceasing what little interaction he does get through vocal stimulation (call and response) would probably lead him to distress and making more noise. I speak from experience with my own cat, we joke that my sister is HIS emotional support human, and since she's at college currently he is very upset. The only real way I can get him to calm down is by talking back to him or rocking him like a baby in my arms (very hard as he's a big boy)\n\nYour partner however, is a full grown adult, they can deal with a little bit of noise for the sake of care towards your pet. Would they expect you to ignore a baby? It's splitting hairs here but it's not all that different in terms of responsibilities, a pet requires as much care as a baby does, for even longer because they can never grow to be self sufficient.\n\nProbably an unpopular opinion, but when you date a person you sign up to also at least co inhabit a space with whatever animals they have, expecting someone to change the way they treat their pets, and even asking them to get rid of them, crosses a major line for me.

Cats retain the ability to meow purely to communicate with their humans. They do it to tell you they found something, to get your attention, to ask something of you. You wouldn't ignore a child trying to babble at you. It's rude and affects their social development.\n\nNot to mention, if you stop responding to them they'll just find other ways of getting your attention. Can some cats be excessively loud? But this sounds like a normal level of response to a cat not being 100% quiet.\n\nMy cat's a squeaker and will have little squeaky conversations if you squeak back to her. She probably falls into the \"very vocal\" category for that. If anyone told me not to squeak at her I would replace their granola with cat litter.", "NTA \n\nHey, seriously, maybe it's time to rethink your partner choice.

Your partner thinks the sound of meowing is awful and wants you to pick them over your cat.

She was a chaotic mess just six months ago.\n\nWe talk to her all the time, and she has most certainly learned how to communicate with us by watching our faces.
