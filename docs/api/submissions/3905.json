Jack is the usual entitled popular kid. It\u2019s funny because the last school I went to, popular kids didn\u2019t really exist so he just feels like a walking stereotype. \n\nAnyways my mom is a single mom. My dad died when I was 8.\n\nI assumed Jack had the stereotypical family but turns out his mom is a single mom as well. Our moms met at some single mom support group. The only difference is that his mom is really well off. \n\nI\u2018ve noticed that when someone mentions parents, he acts as if he has two. None of my business. It\u2019s just that his girlfriend always makes fun of me for having a single mom and he always laughs along.\n\nMy mom was dropping something off for me and Jack and his friends were hanging out nearby and the girlfriend immediately started to make fun of my mom. \n\nI felt so sad because I know my mom heard before driving off. \n\nThey just kept laughing though and some of them started calling me pathetic for not having a dad. I made eye contact with Jack who didn\u2019t look guilty at all and I just got mad.\n\nI told them something along the lines of: \u201cIdk why you guys are trying so hard to bully me about not having a dad when Jack doesn\u2019t have one either. He\u2019s literally right there, bother him. That would be a lot easier than following me around. Also, my dad didn\u2019t really have a choice in leaving. Jack\u2019s dad chose to leave, isn\u2019t that more pathetic?\u201d \n\nIt got really awkward. Jack tried acting like I was crazy but admitted to it. They were all really confused. I just walked off and they haven\u2019t bothered me since. \n\nJack did corner me during our class together though. He said that I had no right to air out his business and he said that I was fucking insane for bringing up his family. I asked if he was being serious-his gf literally brings up mine all the time. He just told me that it isn\u2019t the same and then basically called me an asshole. \n\nI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole but I do feel bad. Especially for the comment I made about his dad leaving him. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right and although he still hangs out with the same friends, he\u2019s a lot quieter. My cousins also say it was mean or that I could\u2019ve just left it at \u201cJack has a single mom too\u201d instead of airing out everything.

No, because Jackass Jack has been letting his friends and girlfriend bully you over having a deceased father. \n\nThis kid undoubtedly has issues from being abandoned by his dad, but he doesn't get to take them out on you.", "NTA. Bullies need to face the consequences of their actions or they don't change.", "NTA. Jack was happy to sit by or passively participate in insulting your mom. His gf may have been the real instigator, but he was comfortable going along with it.\n\nIt is common knowledge that belittling a mom is make her children and angry and protective. Hurting the only parent you have means that the gloves come off.\n\nHe earned being called out by insulting your mom. He must have known that at some point, you would snap and 'reveal' him. He played a stupid game, and won the inevitable prize.", "NTA. do NOT feel bad. he can\u2019t take it? shouldn\u2019t dish it out. your father is passed, being a single mom isn\u2019t easy, there is nothing about this situation that is laughable. you could\u2019ve done/said worse and you didn\u2019t, even though he clearly deserves it.", "NTA- he has contributed in bullying while lying about his situation which is similar to yours and avoiding the bullying himself by lying. He should've been sticking up for you and instead chose to be a shitty friend among shitty friends. You don't need that negativity in your life. I recommend finding another friend group because this group is full of assholes.", "NTA. What an insanely stupid thing to make fun of someone for. As if you or your mother had a choice in losing your dad. I'm so sorry for your loss. Those kids are the ones who are pathetic. If Jack can't stand up for you against his own friends and girlfriend, what kind of friend does that make him? Don't feel bad about it, they pushed you too far, and your \"friend\" stood there and said nothing to stop them. Yeah, I'll bet half those kids' parents are cheating on each other or divorced anyway.", "NTA- people in glass houses shouldn\u2019t cast stones. There is a difference. Your dad passed away and his parents decided to separate, so he\u2019s the one in the glass house expecting special treatment because\u2026? He\u2019s entitled.

You should have left it at \"Jack's mom is a single mom too\"\n\nWhether he deserved the humiliation or not his father leaving them was not his choice or fault.\n\nThen again I think you said it in a moment of heat and you feel bad so you are NTA for me.", "NTA but who the hell are you hanging around with? These aren't real friends and are very horribly cruel. \n\nJack had it coming for letting his girlfriend speak to you like that repeatedly.\n\nGet some new friends they suck.", "Bra he started it u finished it u owe a bully nothing", "NTA When you start a fight you don\u2019t get to whine because the other is punching harder than you.", "ESH. I am genuinely in awe at some of these posters feeling bad at clapping back. It actually gives me hope for society but at the same time, it\u2019s good to know how and when to stand up for yourself. It wasn\u2019t your place to air his family\u2019s business. It wasn\u2019t his gf\u2019s place to make fun of you. It wasn\u2019t his place to just laugh and bully you knowing full well he has a single mom too. It\u2019s up to you to apologize but either way, I wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it.
