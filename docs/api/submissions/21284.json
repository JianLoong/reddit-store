If your sister wants to include bio-mom in her birthday that is up to her. Your birthday is not about your sister.", "NTA - You have the right to set boundaries and have them respected. It\u2019s your birthday, it\u2019s about how you want to reflect and celebrate. Maybe in the future, your bio-mom can be included or you can find a new tradition but neither she nor your sister get to dictate on what schedule. Stay strong and happy belated birthday", "NTA. It's your day and you should celebrate it the way you want to with the people you want to celebrate with. You and your sister were essentially abandoned by your bio mom for most of your lives. It's great that she's making an effort to get back into your lives now and that you & your sister are willing to give her a chance, but it should go at a pace you're comfortable with. Bio mom should hopefully be able to understand that. Your sister is apparently more ready to include her in family things right now, but that doesn't mean you have to be ready too. It's your birthday, so you get to decide. And I hope you have the happiest birthday!", "NTA. Your mother gave you up. She is trying to be in your life now, but you can do what you want on your birthday.", "Nta,\n\nYour birthday is your day to do what you please.  You could ask your bio mom if she would like to do something over the weekend if you would like to have separate plans.", "NTA, it takes a lot of nerve for her to ask to come into another woman's house (your \"Ma\" / stepmom) and spend the day binge watching a movie till everyone falls asleep.  As for your sister remind her that she might have childhood memories of this woman, but she walked out on you while you were still in diapers.    You dad and ma built a wonderful tradition for you.  You are so lucky that ma came into your life and treats you as her own child.", "NTA. You should do what you like for your birthday, and you don\u2019t need to have any more contact with your bio mother than you want.", "NTA.  Your said it yourself - your sister was far more affected by your bio-mother's absence than you were, and it sounds like your stepmom did a pretty good job of stepping in.  You're exactly right in that your sister is trying to fill the loss of your bio-mom then, by bonding with her now, and trying to make \"one big happy family\" fantasies.  But some losses can't be made up so quickly, if at all.  You have your own, created family, and you have traditions and birthday rituals that you really enjoy with them.  You get to have that, and you don't have to sacrifice it or change it so that your sister can try to live out a fantasy that will never be reality.  She can have your mother there for her birthday, if she wants.  While, as you said, your bio-mom is trying, she is pushing for more than you are willing to give, probably because, like your sister, she thinks she can make up for lost time.  She can't.  She may be able to build a good, solid relationship with either or both of you eventually, but those years will always be gone, and trying to pretend that everything can be smoothed over is just going to make it worse.", "Ehhh?  You don\u2019t know her.  Assume you are not interested in relationship with her. You don\u2019t need her in your life. She\u2019s stranger to you.  Move on. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA - your bio can\u2019t dump you for over a decade and expect everything to be rosy.        \nIt\u2019s entirely up to you who you spend your birthday with.         \nJust be careful your sister doesn\u2019t invite them behind your back.           \nAlso, your birthday sounds awesome \ud83e\udd29", "NTA.

To him she is a stranger and she needs to build the relationship slowing. His stepmother is the only mom he has known. \n\nHis sister on the other hand  was 5 so she has memories of her mom and it is understandable why she wants to dive back with her.", "NTA.\n\nSister's traumas aren't yours to have to heal.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell your sister to F\\*\\*\\* off. YOu are fine not to want your neglectful bio mom in your life.", "NAH. Take it easy on your sister. She has memories of bio mom that you don't because you were so young when she left. But sis was around five. A part of her might blame herself for bio mom's leaving so she's anxious to get her back.\n\nBut she's a stranger to you, like a distant aunt who pinches your cheeks when she sees you. You have to be polite because she's family but you don't have to like it. So no, you don't have to celebrate your actual birthday with bio mom. \n\nHowever, you could do a small thing with her and your sister on a different day like you do with your friends. Maybe out to a movie or a lunch?", "NTA\n\nI'm so glad you have lovely parents who love and take care of you.  Your bio mom is not one of these parents and you can have as much or as little to do with her as you choose.  No guilt, whatever you decide to do.  And bio mom really does have nerve to invite herself and your half-sibs over for your b'day -- grossly inappropriate, as is the whole looking devastated thing, which constitutes guilting you and pressure.  Not OK.  \n\nPlease be gentle with your sister, though.  Even though bio mom abandoned both of you, clearly you're processing it in different ways.  She doesn't get to pressure you to do anything you don't want to do, but maybe ease up on her if you can as it sounds like she's really hurting.  (Not because of you, because of bio mom and her experience of the abandonment.)\n\nAgain, NTA"]}
