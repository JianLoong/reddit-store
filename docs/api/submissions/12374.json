We have been planning our wedding for over a year and we have a strict guest limit of 100 people due to the venue and our budget. We decided to invite only our closest family and friends, and we had to make some tough choices about who to include or exclude. \n\nOne of the people we decided not to invite was my cousin (28M). He and I were never close growing up, and he has always been rude and disrespectful to me and my fianc\u00e9. He has made fun of our relationship, called us names, spread rumors about us, and tried to sabotage our engagement party. He is also a notorious troublemaker who likes to cause drama and start fights at family gatherings. He has been banned from several relatives\u2019 homes for his behavior. \n\nMy aunt (his mom) called me yesterday and demanded to know why I didn\u2019t send him an invitation. She said he was hurt and angry that I excluded him from such an important event in my life. She said he deserved to be there as my family and that I was being selfish and petty. She also threatened to boycott the wedding if I didn\u2019t change my mind. \n\nI told her that I was sorry she felt that way, but I had no intention of inviting him. I said he had done nothing but disrespect me and my fiance\u00e9 and I didn\u2019t want him to ruin our special day. I said it was my wedding and I had the right to decide who to invite or not. I said I loved her and hoped she would still come, but I understood if she chose not to. \n\nShe hung up on me and later sent me a long text message calling me a horrible person and a bad cousin. She said I was breaking the family apart and that I would regret my decision. She also said she was not coming to the wedding and neither were any of her other relatives who sided with her. \n\nI feel bad that I upset her and caused a rift in the family, but I also feel like I don\u2019t owe my cousin anything after how he treated me. My fianc\u00e9 supports me and says he doesn\u2019t want him there either.

There's no peace, there was never going to be peace.", "> She also said she was not coming to the wedding and neither were any of her other relatives who sided with her.\n\nGreat news! frees up a few seats for some more friends.  NTA", "NTA. Think of this as a good thing. Any of your family that sides with your aunt can be immediately cut from your life. They\u2019ll just identify themselves as not caring about you.", "Something something trash taking itself out.\n\nNTA Your cousin got this way over many many years of being surrounded by enablers.", "NTA and use the freshly released seats to invite some of your friends who might have otherwise missed out on the special event. Make no mistake, let there be only those who wish to share your happiness be there for the event and all of those sulkies can stay at home. Its your wedding and the last person you want there is some creep who disrespected you and your fiancee and an aunt who doesn't have much common sense. Get on with life and getting rid of some of the relatives isn't a bad wedding tradition as you will be getting a good number of new ones anyway. You can't keep everyone happy and you surely dont have to. Its your special day and congrats.", "NTA. Are you really wondering? It makes so much sense to exclude someone who has actively tried to harm your relationship--I've never heard a better case for keeping someone out.", "Hard NTA\n\nNo one ever \"deserves\" to be invited to weddings. They get invited because they have a great relationship with the bride/groom and they don't want to have a wedding day without that person being there to celebrate. I swear weddings bring out the WORST entitlement of some people.", "NTA at all. And if she was so concerned about \u201ckeeping the family together\u201d then she should\u2019ve stepped in whenever her son was being rude to you and your fianc\u00e9, and I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s a long-standing problem and he\u2019s probably done that to either of you in front of her. \n\nIt also might be good to hire security for the wedding in case any of them try to crash it and cause a scene.", "NTA, and anyone who disagrees and refuses to attend your wedding is just making your wedding day more enjoyable for you and your fiance! \nYou don't owe anyone anything, and it sounds like you'll avoid some drama.", "NTA. Being family isn't a free pass to be a jerk, and it's not a free pass to a wedding. \n\nPlus, he shouldn't need his mom to fight his battles.", "Completely NTA. Why would you want someone who thinks badly about the people involved in the wedding AT the wedding?\n\nYour aunt is just mad that her son is being called out on his shit.", "NTA\nYour cousin is an idiot, Your aunt says that dividing the family, when it's your cousin who started doing it, aside because your cousin wants to go to the wedding, was he always disrespectful to you and your fianc\u00e9?\nUse the seats of family members who will not go and invite your friends who did not reach an invitation", "NTA. \n\nYour aunt\u2019s histrionics are a main reason why her son acts the way he does. She\u2019ll keep insisting on her son being invited to places where he causes trouble. If she threatens to not attend unless her kid does, I\u2019d consider that a win.", "NTA - it's your day and there is no rule saying you have to invite people, relatives or not.  Enjoy your day stress free and it's your aunt's loss.", "NTA.  Sharp knife cuts clean.  Kudos to you for being candid with your aunt, and giving her the honest information she needed to make her decision on whether or not to attend.  You want your wedding day to be a happy event, and the attendance of the \"aunt\" contingency would certainly take away from that joy.\n\nWeddings are already stressful to begin with.  You don't need this drama", "NTA\n\nYou did not cause the rift. Your cousin did. The rift was already there--you say several relatives won't invite Cousin to their homes. \n\nYour lack of a wedding invite might have made the rift wider, but it certainly did not cause it.", "NTA. Your wedding is YOUR day. You are not required to appease family members or accommodate someone who is unkind to your and your soon to be spouse. This reminds me of why I eloped lol", "NTA given your cousin's behavior I have no idea how that would \"keep the peace\". You told your aunt exactly why he wasn't invited and her only response was he should be invited anyway??  And she's aware hes been banned from other relatives due to his behavior so this is not a one off. He's 28(!!), if he's that butthurt he can call you and discuss it himself instead of getting mom to call - don't invite him.", "NTA but your Aunt is. Ignore your Aunt and anyone bringing up this topic.", "After reading about the aunt\u2019s behavior, we get it. Get a new head count and invite some friends. I wouldn\u2019t want the cousin or his handler there either. NTA", "NTA - It doesn't sound like you're missing out on much if some of the cousin's family members of yours don't turn up. It sounds crazy to me why anyone who is inherently unlikeable should expect to invited to a family member's wedding just because they're family.", "NTA - it's your wedding, you can invite who you like.\n\nI had a drunk/jerk uncle.  He didn't get invited.  I was asked why by his mom and simply said, \"money is tight and I haven't seen him for a while\".  Nothing complex here.  I don't think you need to go into a long explanation of what a jerk the cousin is.  Simply state \"we aren't that close and space is limited, I'm so sorry\".  Move on - no more talking will change anyone's opinion.\n\nGood news is that your Aunt frees up another space for you to invite someone else.", "NTA. Why would you want to invite a troublemaker who has already been banned from other relatives' houses? Especially since he treats you & your fianc\u00e9 so badly. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have security at your wedding. Just in case he shows up & tries to start trouble.", "NTA. You didn't cause anything. He caused the rift by being an asshole.", "NTA You had limited space & couldn\u2019t invite everyone. It would have been MUCH better if you had told your aunt it was a space issue (it was) instead of going off on what an ass her son is. She obviously knows he\u2019s an ass, and bringing that up just made her angry & defensive. (Yes, everything you said was true, but that doesn\u2019t mean it needed to be said.) \n\nStill, not inviting him was the right call.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not only did he not deserve to be invited since he had no respect for your relationship, but you could not trust him being that he has a history of causing problems with other family members as well. You are probably lucky if the family members that side with your aunt even though her son behaves this way stay home, if they were even invited in the first place. I really do not understand the audacity of people who think they have the right to determine who gets to be invited to your event.
