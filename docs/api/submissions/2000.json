My fiancee and I are keeping it relatively small with around 30-40 people. My parents got divorced a couple years ago and my dad remarried rather quickly to Jen. Jen is a lot younger than my parents, 32 I think, absolutely gorgeous, and this bothers my mom quite a bit. I get that its a big age gap but I figure she's an adult who can make her own decisions and they seem really happy together so whatever. She's always been super nice to me and my fiancee, so I have nothing against her. My parents divorce was a little messy with my dad initiating it, my mom will still make digs at my dad but my dad just doesnt talk about her, or if he does he only says positive things.\n\nWell when going over the guest with my mother she had a bunch of family friends she asked if I was inviting. I told her no because those are people I dont consider myself close to and my fiancee and I want it to be small, immediate family, some cousins, and good friends. She asked if Jen was getting an invite, and I told her of course. She is my dad's wife and we have a good relationship, so yes she will be there. My mom freaked out. Said these family friends have been in my life way longer than Jen and im choosing a golddigger (my father would be considered wealthy by most people) over these people. I told her Im allowing my father to bring a plus one, and I never would have considered inviting my mother's friends again, because Im not close to them. She then said she doesnt know if she'll go to the wedding if Jen's there.\n\nNot wanting to deal with this, I told her that saddens me but to make up her mind by January as thats when we need a number for the Venue. She then told me Im choosing Jen over my own mother. I dont personally feel that way but my older sister who is Jen's age, also doesnt love the whole situatoin and is saying I should just uninvite Jen. AITA for keeping Jen on the list? Personally I think Jen is awesome and would love to celebrate with her, and I think the whole thing is pretty dumb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, I have offered my mom a plus one if she wants to bring a date or a friend. No, Jen was not an affair partner though my sister and I both are pretty sure they either both cheated on each other or they had an open marriage. The marriage was never seemed like a great one as long as I can remember.

And as a final insult, now she knows she doesn't even have her close family friends, who she's known for years and can support her, coming to this ceremony.\n\nOP, I'd find room for another couple, ask your mom to choose which one. Who cares if she has a \"plus one\" or a \"plus two\" (another couple)? If you move forward as you are, sure, in the strictest sense you're NTA, but you are putting an older woman whom you love in a tough spot (even if theoretically sure, she shouldn't mind).\n\nI'd let her choose another couple, make her happy, all for just an extra person or two.\n\nThere's being NTA, then there's being someone who goes out of his way to be there for his mom at a tough time.  Be the latter - and congratulations!", "Info: was your dad having an affair with with Jen before he left your mom?", "INFO: Is your mother allowed a plus one?", "Your mom needs counselling to help her get past the hurts from the past. Whether she'll do that is unknown at this point. You should have who you want to have at the wedding. My sister-in-law told us that she couldn't come because she didn't have anything to wear. We said come in anything to avoid any drama she was trying to stir up. She did. It was lovely. Your mom needs to put you first in this situation. She may be feeling insecure and aggrieved but she's your mom and as such is irreplaceable in every way. You're handing this the right way. Don't get emotional. Mom needs to get over the past and focus on your happiness.", "NTA\n\nBut please sit down with your mom as this will be very hard for her. This is a small wedding and so it's going to be hard for her to avoid Jen. It's a recent divorce, recent relationship and all very raw for her. \n\nTell her you really want her there. If she agrees to come then try to make it comfortable for her. Maybe allow her to invite a couple of her close friends so she has some people around her (if she's not dating anyone, allowing a couple of those family friends she requested seems reasonable) Make her welcome and cared for and hopefully a bit busy so she doesn't need to stew about her gorgeous replacement.", "NTA.

Based on your post the timeliness seems pretty tight. Before having this as your hill to die on, I would make sure you know the story there. Talk to your sister, see what she knows.\n\nIf there was an affair, I would consider it too soon to put your mother through having to play nice and dad can deal w/ leaving Jen at home.\n\nHonestly, even if there wasn't an affair, I get you mom  being upset at having to deal w/ your father's new bride. Your dad dumped her and got re-married right away. Have you ever had a BF dump you and then have a GF 2 days later? Well, imagine that pain only after 20+ years and kids together.  Imagine what you would feel if your fiancee did that to you in 20+ years and your kid was bassicaly \"the new wife is nice, so what is the problem, mom?\" Consider inviting 1 or 2 of her friends so she has some additional support. Give her a +1 or +2. You don't want her to be the cheese standing alone. That would be miserable for her and really tarnish the memory of the wedding.", "NTA. You're not picking Jen over your mother.

You invite who you want to and thats that. If you want Jen to be there as your dad's plus one, great do it. Second, your mother may have ill feelings towards your dad and Jen but this occasion is literally about you and your fiance. The attention will be on you and she shouldnt be acting like a child about it and be there to support her son.\n\nNTA", "NTA you can invite who you want, but I would think your mother is more important than the fathers new wife.  Seriously she is 4 years older than you - of course your mother is upset - she was with your father for nearly 30 years - and then he just marries someone who could be his daughter?  And it's only been a couple of years?  During a pandemic he managed to somehow meet and marry this woman?   It must be humiliating for her.  She is your mother - unless she has done something really awful to you, its cruel to just tell her not to come.  For me this is easy - sorry dad, but your gold-digger, I mean wife, will have to sit this one out.", "NTA. Your mom is out of line trying to force you to pick between her and someone else who by your own comments has been nothing but good to you and your father. Just because your father is considered wealthy and your stepmom is younger and gorgeous doesn't mean she's a gold digger. I understand your mom's jealous or whatever the case may be but your mom is also an adult and it's probably time she starts acting like one.", "NTA, my uncles wife demanded I not invite his ex wife (who has been in my life since birth even after their divorce) because 'she isn't blood family so now they're divorced she's irrelevant'. I told her they were both my aunts and would both be receiving an invite. If she had a problem its an invite not a summons and feel free to decline. Only she would be missing out over her own insecurities.\n\nShe'd already pulled this shit with others who had given into her demands. If you give in this once she'll do the same with everything.", "Had this sort of situation at my wedding. My husband and I were rather young and just wanted to do a city hall, dinner afterwards with parents, siblings and grandparents (not a lot of cash for the two of us..)  Got talked into the big wedding-to-do by the inlaws instead, they said they'd cover..  Even then, we wanted only family and our close friends. My mom absolutely had to have her friends at it because my father would be there with his wife of almost 4 years and my half brother of about 2 years old.  Wouldn't attend otherwise.  They'd been divorced for over a decade at that point.  She insisted she needed her support group to get through the wedding.So I gave in and invited them and it turned out their whole families as well (not people I really would've invited on my own).  Then she refused to even pay for their plates.  Or anything to do with the wedding.  (said she'd cover flowers.. then didn't like the flowers I chose and refused).  My father was in another province and couldn't be too involved but he did set up and paid for our photographer as well as gift us his timeshare for the honeymoon.  Then when he arrived for the wedding, he sat down with my father in law and asked to cover our half of the wedding - and covered my mom's guests on top of it.  So much drama - but it would've been worse if I hadn't invited her friends I think.  Sometimes, you gotta weigh how much drama you want.. I choose less and made her happy.  NTA at all.  (I want to not even get into how it went when we told her we were engaged, I thought I was being nice and telling her first since we lived in the same city, I was planning to phone my father that night.  Instead, my father called me and asked if I was \"in trouble\" because that's what my mom insinuated was happening when she decided to call him - after I said I was calling him that evening..)\n\nIs there a compromise for your mother that would make her happy so that she'd attend?  Maybe that's the way to go.", "NTA. \n\n> She then told me Im choosing Jen over my own mother.\n\nThis is false. If your mother declines your invitation, it's a decision to place her dislike for Jen above her love for you.", "NTA\n\n> my mom will still make digs at my dad but my dad just doesnt talk about her, or if he does he only says positive things.\n\nLOL, my first thought is they're both being honest here - your dad doesn't have anything bad to say because he's the irresponsible/dishonest one. Even so, it's not Jen's fault and your mom needs to get over her resentment there.\n\n>Yes, I have offered my mom a plus one if she wants to bring a date or a friend.\n\nAs someone further down suggested, you need to invite at least one other couple that she's asked about, because she doesn't have a trophy husband yet, but she does have friends. Let her choose who those 2 will be, and seat them all together.", "I'm guessing Jen is hot..\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude01", "No.\n\nYour mom is acting like a child and making it \"her vs Jen\". I would just tell her to put on her big-girl panties and suck it up for a few hours.", "NTA, your wedding, your guest list.
