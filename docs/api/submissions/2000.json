My fiancee and I are keeping it relatively small with around 30-40 people. My parents got divorced a couple years ago and my dad remarried rather quickly to Jen. Jen is a lot younger than my parents, 32 I think, absolutely gorgeous, and this bothers my mom quite a bit. I get that its a big age gap but I figure she's an adult who can make her own decisions and they seem really happy together so whatever. She's always been super nice to me and my fiancee, so I have nothing against her. My parents divorce was a little messy with my dad initiating it, my mom will still make digs at my dad but my dad just doesnt talk about her, or if he does he only says positive things.\n\nWell when going over the guest with my mother she had a bunch of family friends she asked if I was inviting. I told her no because those are people I dont consider myself close to and my fiancee and I want it to be small, immediate family, some cousins, and good friends. She asked if Jen was getting an invite, and I told her of course. She is my dad's wife and we have a good relationship, so yes she will be there. My mom freaked out. Said these family friends have been in my life way longer than Jen and im choosing a golddigger (my father would be considered wealthy by most people) over these people. I told her Im allowing my father to bring a plus one, and I never would have considered inviting my mother's friends again, because Im not close to them. She then said she doesnt know if she'll go to the wedding if Jen's there.\n\nNot wanting to deal with this, I told her that saddens me but to make up her mind by January as thats when we need a number for the Venue. She then told me Im choosing Jen over my own mother. I dont personally feel that way but my older sister who is Jen's age, also doesnt love the whole situatoin and is saying I should just uninvite Jen. AITA for keeping Jen on the list? Personally I think Jen is awesome and would love to celebrate with her, and I think the whole thing is pretty dumb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, I have offered my mom a plus one if she wants to bring a date or a friend. No, Jen was not an affair partner though my sister and I both are pretty sure they either both cheated on each other or they had an open marriage. The marriage was never seemed like a great one as long as I can remember.

Her ex is bringing his hot young wife who's barely older than his daughter. And as a final insult, now she knows she doesn't even have her close family friends, who she's known for years and can support her, coming to this ceremony.\n\nOP, I'd find room for another couple, ask your mom to choose which one. Who cares if she has a \"plus one\" or a \"plus two\" (another couple)? If you move forward as you are, sure, in the strictest sense you're NTA, but you are putting an older woman whom you love in a tough spot (even if theoretically sure, she shouldn't mind).\n\nI'd let her choose another couple, make her happy, all for just an extra person or two.\n\nThere's being NTA, then there's being someone who goes out of his way to be there for his mom at a tough time.  Be the latter - and congratulations!", "Info: was your dad having an affair with with Jen before he left your mom?", "INFO: Is your mother allowed a plus one?", "Your mom needs counselling to help her get past the hurts from the past. Whether she'll do that is unknown at this point. You should have who you want to have at the wedding. My sister-in-law told us that she couldn't come because she didn't have anything to wear. We said come in anything to avoid any drama she was trying to stir up. She did. It was lovely. Your mom needs to put you first in this situation. She may be feeling insecure and aggrieved but she's your mom and as such is irreplaceable in every way. You're handing this the right way. Don't get emotional. Mom needs to get over the past and focus on your happiness.", "NTA\n\nBut please sit down with your mom as this will be very hard for her. This is a small wedding and so it's going to be hard for her to avoid Jen. It's a recent divorce, recent relationship and all very raw for her. \n\nTell her you really want her there. If she agrees to come then try to make it comfortable for her. Maybe allow her to invite a couple of her close friends so she has some people around her (if she's not dating anyone, allowing a couple of those family friends she requested seems reasonable) Make her welcome and cared for and hopefully a bit busy so she doesn't need to stew about her gorgeous replacement.", "NTA.

Based on your post the timeliness seems pretty tight. Before having this as your hill to die on, I would make sure you know the story there. Talk to your sister, see what she knows.\n\nIf there was an affair, I would consider it too soon to put your mother through having to play nice and dad can deal w/ leaving Jen at home.\n\nHonestly, even if there wasn't an affair, I get you mom  being upset at having to deal w/ your father's new bride. Your dad dumped her and got re-married right away. Have you ever had a BF dump you and then have a GF 2 days later? Well, imagine that pain only after 20+ years and kids together.  Imagine what you would feel if your fiancee did that to you in 20+ years and your kid was bassicaly \"the new wife is nice, so what is the problem, mom?\" Consider inviting 1 or 2 of her friends so she has some additional support. Give her a +1 or +2. You don't want her to be the cheese standing alone. That would be miserable for her and really tarnish the memory of the wedding.", "NTA. You're not picking Jen over your mother.

You invite who you want to and thats that. If you want Jen to be there as your dad's plus one, great do it. Second, your mother may have ill feelings towards your dad and Jen but this occasion is literally about you and your fiance. The attention will be on you and she shouldnt be acting like a child about it and be there to support her son.\n\nNTA", "NTA you can invite who you want, but I would think your mother is more important than the fathers new wife.  Seriously she is 4 years older than you - of course your mother is upset - she was with your father for nearly 30 years - and then he just marries someone who could be his daughter?  And it's only been a couple of years?  During a pandemic he managed to somehow meet and marry this woman?   It must be humiliating for her.  She is your mother - unless she has done something really awful to you, its cruel to just tell her not to come.  For me this is easy - sorry dad, but your gold-digger, I mean wife, will have to sit this one out.", "NTA. Your mom is out of line trying to force you to pick between her and someone else who by your own comments has been nothing but good to you and your father. Just because your father is considered wealthy and your stepmom is younger and gorgeous doesn't mean she's a gold digger. I understand your mom's jealous or whatever the case may be but your mom is also an adult and it's probably time she starts acting like one.", "NTA, my uncles wife demanded I not invite his ex wife (who has been in my life since birth even after their divorce) because 'she isn't blood family so now they're divorced she's irrelevant'. I told her they were both my aunts and would both be receiving an invite. If she had a problem its an invite not a summons and feel free to decline. Only she would be missing out over her own insecurities.\n\nShe'd already pulled this shit with others who had given into her demands. If you give in this once she'll do the same with everything.", "Had this sort of situation at my wedding. My husband and I were rather young and just wanted to do a city hall, dinner afterwards with parents, siblings and grandparents (not a lot of cash for the two of us..)  Got talked into the big wedding-to-do by the inlaws instead, they said they'd cover..  Even then, we wanted only family and our close friends. My mom absolutely had to have her friends at it because my father would be there with his wife of almost 4 years and my half brother of about 2 years old.  Wouldn't attend otherwise.  They'd been divorced for over a decade at that point.  She insisted she needed her support group to get through the wedding.So I gave in and invited them and it turned out their whole families as well (not people I really would've invited on my own).  Then she refused to even pay for their plates.  Or anything to do with the wedding.  (said she'd cover flowers.. then didn't like the flowers I chose and refused).  My father was in another province and couldn't be too involved but he did set up and paid for our photographer as well as gift us his timeshare for the honeymoon.  Then when he arrived for the wedding, he sat down with my father in law and asked to cover our half of the wedding - and covered my mom's guests on top of it.  So much drama - but it would've been worse if I hadn't invited her friends I think.  Sometimes, you gotta weigh how much drama you want.. I choose less and made her happy.  NTA at all.  (I want to not even get into how it went when we told her we were engaged, I thought I was being nice and telling her first since we lived in the same city, I was planning to phone my father that night.  Instead, my father called me and asked if I was \"in trouble\" because that's what my mom insinuated was happening when she decided to call him - after I said I was calling him that evening..)\n\nIs there a compromise for your mother that would make her happy so that she'd attend?  Maybe that's the way to go.", "NTA. \n\n> She then told me Im choosing Jen over my own mother.\n\nThis is false. If your mother declines your invitation, it's a decision to place her dislike for Jen above her love for you.", "NTA\n\n> my mom will still make digs at my dad but my dad just doesnt talk about her, or if he does he only says positive things.\n\nLOL, my first thought is they're both being honest here - your dad doesn't have anything bad to say because he's the irresponsible/dishonest one. Even so, it's not Jen's fault and your mom needs to get over her resentment there.\n\n>Yes, I have offered my mom a plus one if she wants to bring a date or a friend.\n\nAs someone further down suggested, you need to invite at least one other couple that she's asked about, because she doesn't have a trophy husband yet, but she does have friends. Let her choose who those 2 will be, and seat them all together.", "I'm guessing Jen is hot..\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude01", "No.\n\nYour mom is acting like a child and making it \"her vs Jen\". I would just tell her to put on her big-girl panties and suck it up for a few hours.", "NTA, your wedding, your guest list.

Your mom needs to learn how to be around Jen or this drama will happen at every birthday party, school function, etc etc in your kids lives. My grandmother was a bit spoiled and not always self aware and that made it hard to be around her, but I always respected that she never refused to show up for me because of her anger at my grandfather and my step grandmother.  At 23 when I married I didn't have to worry about something that happened before I was born at my wedding. \n\nI never once heard my grandmother refer to her by name but I was also never told I had to dislike her or heard bad about her. She was also always polite and respectful to my step-aunt and step-uncle.  When my grandmother died and I found out that the version I had been told of the step grandmother(who in my mind was just like a grandmother) just being there after the divorce was a lie and she had been the other woman. It made me really respect my actual grandmother and her approach of not making her boys or her grandkids deal with the burden of her anger.", "You seem to have absolutely no sympathy for your mom. She lost a long term marriage and within no time was replaced by someone who's the same age as her daughter. Did your father buy your favor I assume? How is any of this fair to her? You clearly don't love your mother. The only reason you like the new side piece is because she's pretty and was a former model. It's obvious that you're barely holding back from gushing over how hot she is. I guess like father, like son. You're not feeling conflicted at all, you just don't care. Your contempt for your mother is dripping throughout the post.", "It's OP's day, not OP's mother's day. It's been years. She needs to get over it. And yes, my parents are divorced (for over 20 years now) and my mom still talks shit about my dad. It's not fun and I have very little tolerance for this bullshit.", "He's not being awful. He's just exposing himself as the AH who thinks a man leaving his wife for a woman young enough to be his daughter is amazing. He's got several super nice things to say about the newer model and won't give a flipping inch to the woman who gave birth to him. I'd bet dollars to donuts that he's just the type of man to do exactly the same thing when he gets to a certain age.", "My point is that you\u2019re an asshole if you condone shitty behavior just because of blood ties and you really need to do something about it. Imagine being okay with your family treated innocent people like shit because \u201cbut they\u2019re family!!!\u201d \n\nSeek help.", "There seems to be a lot of projection in your comment, hope everything is ok with you.\n\nI acknowledge Jen is conventionally beautiful, but I dont have the hots for her lol. The reason I like her is that she's always been super cool to me and my fiancee, she makes my dad happy, and she's a very pleasant person to be around. My mom has made plenty of digs at her and she's always taken the high road and not retaliated. I do really want my mom to be there if she can be an adult about the whole situation. It doesnt feel fair to punish the person who hasnt done anything wrong. But yes, I am conflicted or I wouldnt have posted.", "I'm not the only person in the comments who feels like you lack empathy for your mother. The age gap between your father and his new squeeze isn't helping either, she's younger than his daughter. It's not projection, it's feeling heartbreak on behalf of your mother. I can't imagine how it must've felt being divorced at her age. Old age should've been a breeze right now, instead she has to lose a partner and watch him cuddling with someone half her age. What a slap in her face. No one deserves that. Their timeline is way too suspicious, he must've had an affair and just hid it really well until divorce. AitA is full for guys like your father, it's heartbreaking for all the women who have to go through this. Finding yourself alone at that age is bound to have negative effects.", "He said he doesn't blame his dad to divorce. You have no idea how this woman was like a mother OP seems to love her just cause she is his mother but wouldn't be around her otherwise.", "Put this in another comment but my sister and I are both about 99% sure either they both cheated (LOTS of rumors about both of them) or they had an unconventional marriage. Its gross for me to think about but it is what it is. All that aside their marriage never seemed great as long as I can remember. I dont think she misses him, I think she's embarrassed he moved on first. Which I can empathize with but I dont think its fair to punish him over."]}
