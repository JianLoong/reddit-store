Like if it's early-but-still-reasonable like right after going out for dinner or something, that feels acceptable, but if you're kicking people out of a common room (because that's what it is, even if you're sleeping there) at random times because you want to nap or go to sleep in the middle of the day, I would find that super rude to guests.", "Sounds like they should have taken the family room. \n\nNTA", "Why don\u2019t you just go lay down and sleep in your parents bed. Then after the movie, your parents can fix up your bed on the couch and usher you back to the couch. \n\nSeems a pretty easy solution for a temporary situation where there are more guests than beds.

You have a stressful job and certainly need uninterrupted sleep.  I don\u2019t know many people who could be woken up in the night to switch rooms/beds and just fall back to sleep.

I\u2019ve asked around and I don\u2019t know ANY people who would be moved and then just fall back to sleep.  \n\nI don\u2019t understand why your parents don\u2019t intervene and switch the rooms so you can go to sleep in your own room. \n\nHey and also -why don\u2019t they watch tv/movie on an iPad or a phone in their room - why does it have to be on a tv?   As guests in someone\u2019s home (I know it\u2019s OP\u2019s sister and BIL but they don\u2019t live there so they are \u201cguests\u201d) you want to be as accommodating as possible.", "I'd offer to switch rooms. You are not the asshole. They are. They are visitors and should act accordingly. They aren't working at the moment, and working people should have priority over those that sponge off others."]}
