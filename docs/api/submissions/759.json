We are an office of about 40 people.  I've (M32) always kept it on the down low I despise dogs.  I tell strangers and my best friends my feelings on dogs.  I don't tell people that i see frequently, because i'd rather not have the conflict.  Someone always has an issue with my thoughts on dogs.  Well recently this came to a head.  \n\nLast week an email went out about dog friendly Fridays and that it would be a thing moving forward as long as the dogs behaved.  This would be a thing every Friday.  Not just once.  If it was just once, so be it.  I'd take a vacation day and lock my office door.  This would be a thing every Friday, i don't have enough vacation time to take off every Friday for the foreseeable future nor do I want to strictly use it for this.   Before this, I loved my job and was cool with my co-workers.  \n\nI went to HR about this and told them i'm not cool with this being a regular thing.  They said their was overwhelming support for this as apparently the group that went to HR for this is pretty large.  I dropped that this is something i'd change jobs over.  Well they reversed course the next day and made it a one time thing instead.  I told them i'd use a vacation day and lock my door.  Well it got out that I ended dog friendly Friday's pretty much before it even started.  Well now my co-workers are cold to me and probably think i'm an evil asshole.

And for the record, I love dogs.\n\nStarted with Fridays, but before long, people started bringing their dogs to work EVERY day. Dogs were pooping outside and having accidents inside. I nearly ran over a little terrier of some sort that had quietly wandered into my cubicle and laid down behind my wheeled chair - thank God I saw her in time, or I probably would have broken her paw, which would have made me feel awful.\n\nWhat finally ended it was the morning the CEO was on his office phone with an important client and somebody's Great Dane started barking - a big, booming bark that echoed through the whole building.

A one time event is one thing but having dogs in the workplace every week is a lot and kind of inconsiderate imo.

I like dogs, and I don\u2019t want them in my office. What if there is barking or nervous peeing or some other noisy/smelly distraction?

I also get not wanting them there.  We have dogs in the office across the hall. Sweet babies (I love animals), however, they bark when delivery people go into the suite.

Unfortunately, with the company ended it so soon, even though it was at your request and I'm glad they responded to your concern, I bet it would have ended after a few weeks. There are always those bosses that think the second someone is away from their desk, that employee must be goofing off. There are also employees who would end up taking dogs outside, getting into a conversation and being gone for half an hour. I bet the policy would have ended on it's own in a month or so at the most.", "I have 2 dogs, and I believe not liking dogs is enough to not have any dogs other than service dogs in the office. And a door on your office is , imo, not enough to change that.

One, something like that should be tried out once before being instituted weekly. Two, it's a distraction that will make it harder to get work done on a timely basis. Three, not all dogs will get along with other dogs or other humans; this could be a liability issue.

Or even have done a survey where if there were others who disagreed could chime in.  But the way it went down, all can blame you of being the guy that ruined it for 'everyone'.   They obviously needed a morale boost in the office and if it was a large group that wanted it - you'll have that around your neck for a while.

It sounds like it'd get distracting and messy, and that's without even factoring in your feelings on dogs. \n\n\na one time thing or even seasonally, could be fun, but think of all the hair, dander, dirt tracked in and err...accidents that are gonna result from this. Are the people who bring dogs in going to stay late and do the extra cleaning? Or if someone needs to go do something and needs to find someone to watch their dog? or barking when on the phone.

Also: It appears that you have an office with a door that locks. So, apparently, you wouldn't have been interacting with the dogs at all anyway. \n\nIn your place, I'd have made it clear to everybody that all dogs had to be kept away from me, absolutely, or else that would be the end of Dog Friendly Fridays. Then I'd have hibernated in the office and/or used the opportunity to negotiate for a remote work day, job allowing.

Or anxious panting dogs....", "I agree with this. The work place is about working and if this is going to hinder OP from doing their job then they were right to speak up. NTA but I can see this turning into an issue with your colleagues even though it shouldn\u2019t.", "Very true...NTA because I have the double whammy of allergies and not liking the needy creatures (I love my independent kitty whose affection I have had to earn, rather than have it foisted upon me all the time). Many dogs are super needy and need stimulation. Horrible for the workplace. Now a workplace cat that just curls up in your lap for hours while you crunch numbers, I have had one of those in a warehouse. Kept mice away too, or at least took their dead bodies to the (vegetarian) general manager's office to throw in the air for her.....", ">But as it is, you rained on a whole lot of people's joy only because you dislike a kind of animal they like. To me that's an AH move.\n\nNo it not.  There is a time and place for being dog friendly.  A work office is not one of them.  \n\nITs ok to not like dogs.", "If you don't like that every Friday everyone brings all their kids in, you can also let them know you're leaving the company if it continues.", "No capacity for hate or evil? Tell that to the families who have lost family members to one of those poorly trained and supervised 'innocent creatures '.", "Glad you think Hitler checked out okay then.", "Or maybe HR just realized what a truly awful idea this was. If they want to have a dog friendly event, hold it after hours at a dog park. That way the people who would like to participate can and the people who go to work to actually work don't have to deal with all the issues that could arise.", "And the world also doesn't revolve around people who think their dogs should be welcome anytime, anywhere. Unless you work for a vet, keep your pets at home where they belong.", "Agreed. Sounds to me that HR was looking for a chance to scrap Dog Fridays & found someone to pass the blame onto. After all: no one other than HR knew the OP complained.", "But I can close my door or work from home so no skin off my nose. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I love MY dogs. I rarely enjoy other people's dogs. I didn't put what I consider much training into my current dog (my mom was an obedience trainer and a bit obsessive with her standards so since I didn't go obsessive I feel like I'm doing it wrong. He's a super good boy and if he wasn't 90 pounds I know at least one of our friends would have tried to smuggle him out in his wife's purse! \ud83d\ude02) and he still is over trained compared to most, but not all, dogs I meet. I think dogs who are ill-behaved due to an intentional lack of training by their owners are exhausting. I'd never, ever want to be around 40 other people's dogs at the same time for 8+ hours!", "This is a good list.", ">You threatening to leave because you don't want to be around dogs is ridiculous imo.\n\nlol no its not.", "Everything about this comment is absurd.\n\nI doubt you are dealing with babies at your office job.", "Yea it is unless he actually has a valid reason.", "You would be surprised what people bring to work when the babysitter cancels", "not liking dogs is a valid reason.  Its not like he went into a dog friendly place and he is trying to change it.  They are changing it on him.", "A personal preference isn't a valid reason.", "In the context of a work place, it absolutely is.", "In the context that OP went to HR over a personal preference, it is ridiculous. If everyone complained over a personal preference then everyone would quit but then get replaced."]}
