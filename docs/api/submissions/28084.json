If I had my time over I would just have eloped like we originally planned.  Oh and kicker brother is already over the girlfriend and looks like she\u2019s about to be dumped.

Now dads partner will want to dictate those attending honeymoon too - guaranteed to ensure no one will be coming..", "I'm confused, didn't OP just say her dad was paying for the wedding breakfast? Idk exactly what that is but it sounds like a relatively cheap part of the entire cost that should be easy to cover vs the entire wedding and should come with no wedding control whatsoever.

Go to Vegas or South Lake Tahoe for a Nevada wedding, or have a beach wedding where the catering is limited to a couple of coolers full of drinks, it's not only okay to have a micro-budget wedding, it's more fun for the guests than some flowery extravaganza!\n\nOr do what I saw two young people do this winter. I was in a national park, and I went to a beauty spot, and there to one side of the trail were a dozen people in a semicircle... watching a young couple exchange vows.  They'd just gone there and picked a spot in the snowy woods, and exchanged their vows surrounded by natural beauty and people who loved them.", "It's not usual for your Dad's new wife that in no way raised you to be butting in.

This isn't her daughter, she was grown and out of the house when she married her father.", "Agreed. Absolutely excellent advice.\n\nThe cold hard reality is that when you fund your wedding yourself, you are in the position of power as to every aspect of what your special day looks like. When a parent(s) pay for some or all of your wedding the dynamics of power shift. The parents then want a say with regard to venue, decor, food and guest list. While some view their gift as just that a gift others feel they have the final say.\n\nSad but true. Politely say thanks but no thanks. If you set up a wedding website with a gift registry direct them there. By removing their hands from the purse strings you remove their ability to dictate.\n\nCongrats on the engagement. I hope your special day is everything you want and more.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "The wedding breakfast is the meal that everybody eats after the ceremony, usually at the start of the reception before drinks and dancing. So the cost varies hugely based on how many guests you have.\n\nNot that it gives the payer any right to dictate anything, of course!", "I'm having a \"proper wedding\" because my mum is from country A, my dad from country B (I've spent about equal time in both countries, so have lots of fam & friends in both), my fiance is from country C but moved to country D as a child, we met & lived in country E. So wherever we were to plan a celebration, people would have to travel there so we wanted to offer a good meal & band etc. And we decided we DID want a wedding wedding so that our families and friends could meet each other. \n\nWe've had zero interfering relatives though - at most helpful & sweetly interested ones", "My husband and I eloped.
