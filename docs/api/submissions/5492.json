Could you honestly live with that? Especially when you want to become a doctor to save lives...?\n\nI don't blame you for being upset or thinking negatively about losing that money.

You are only 17 and you have so many years of life ahead of you, money seriously means nothing. \n\nYour sisters life is far more valuable than money.

Do no harm, you know\u2026 \n\nWith persistent genes like your family\u2019s I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll also find a way to keep your ambitions in tact in the future. \u2018The bird doesn\u2019t sit on the branch because it trusts the branch\u2019s ability to support its weight, it trusts in its ability to fly.\u2019\n\nFor now, all the best with your sister and situation. I can\u2019t imagine having to deal with that and consider your future plans. One thing at a time, the two don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive.", "I don't understand the NTA. Downvote me to hell, Idc. This is OP's sister's life.  What are they supposed to do?  Let her die a painful death?  \"Your sister died from an extremely rare form of cancer that was difficult to treat and we had a fraction of the time we were meant to be her parents loving her, but *thank god* you got to go to college!\"  Come tf on.

This isn't a \"save your sister's life\" treatment. You're making a false parallel because just the stress of getting her to the other country/hospital is likely to kill her. Literally, using the college fund for this will likely just  her sister faster.  \n\nWould you have given your soul and college money to... kill her faster? Because that's what the situation is, from what OP has said. \n\nI'd hope their grandmother would have enough sense to tell OP's family off for ignoring the doctors' warning, taking away both what is left of their sick daughter's life, and their other daughter's future, with one incredibly selfish choice.", "Just to say that you might want to edit your answer - The money is for her to be a medical doctor, not for getting a PhD.", "OP said it is incurable so it unlikely to work", "OP\u2019s parents are going to drive the family into financial ruin in an attempt to maybe help one child live a little longer, at the expense of the other child. That\u2019s not appropriate.", "From what OP said, the actual doctors are saying just getting to the potential treatment can likely kill the sister. OP isn't lacking compassion for realizing that what her parents want isn't what is best for any of them. Including her sister.", "Disagree. \n\nI see compassion for a sister who has such a unfortunate and heartbreaking thing happening to her. \n\nThe real AH is how expensive it is to have to incur the medical debt.

What\u2019s wrong with you?", "By the time my sister got a diagnosis the cancer was also so far in, if the doctors would've taken us seriously then maybe she would've had a better chance but it's super unlikely anything will help her at this point I mean if she survived it would have to be a miracle, the cancer she has is already not curable to begin with.\n\nSo if it was me i'd want my sister to use the money to secure my sister future rather then try to fight a very unlikely winning battle", "The unfortunate fact is the sister is going to die anyway.", "We all die, we don't usually get to choose when unfortunately it sounds like it's sister's time and the parents are deluded by grief", "Have you read the post?", "OP opened the post by saying Gma had passed away.", "Yeah, *you* would use the money. Would your other child be okay with it? I'm guessing their opinion wouldn't matter.", "I'm a straight A student and will be applying to the top universities all my teachers see high potential in me and I'm already writing my college essay and will be including recommendations letters from my teachers. \n\nI may have not been accepted yet but I have high hopes of being accepted and I'm in my last year of school now", "I am sorry for your loss.\n\nIf the 'other country' the treatment is in is Mexico, this is a scam.

They were for you, not for their financial obligations.", "*offers big hugs* This is so hard and I'm so sorry.\n\nYour parents are in an intense state of grief and their actions are understandable but still wrong. \n\nThey're willing to give everything for a miracle. It's not fair to you, but this situation isn't fair to anyone.\n\nYou've gotten advice about how to potentially get legal advice to protect that money. I hope you're able to. If you do protect that money you'll also likely need to move out because your parents' grief will be lashed out at you and you don't deserve that.\n\nNone of you should be facing this and I'm so sorry.", "I would see if you can talk to some lawyers depending in how the money is set up it could be very illegal for them to take money out. You might find a lawyer willing to help you out and your parents could be liable to pay that money back. I know they are in a tough position but stealing your money isnt the answer.", "It doesn\u2019t even sound like that has really even hit you yet, and then on top of it, you have to deal with your parents doing this. They have ZERO right to that money. And they are damaging their relationship with you in the process. I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have any advice to offer as far as options you have, but I wish the best for you, and that your sister can have some comfort before she passes.", "Me too. In no small part because the doctors don't seem to think this is promising. Also because I have heard way too many horror stories of desperate people getting fleeced by quacks who've set up shop in developing countries that won't stop them.", "Yeah, there's a lot of doctors in Mexico and the Phillipines that promise tumor removal that cannot otherwise be done - they actually don't do anything and the \"tumors\" they show off are from pigs or cows.", "Did not register that part, suppose op is going to be left without any adults with their best interest very soon. Always terrible.", "Exactly, I\u2019d say they are more than likely to lose both of them.", "There is no treatment, they are using the money meant to help build her future, on something that will not work. They are heading to lose both daughters. She is NTA and is also trying to cope with the inevitable loss of her sister too.", "Oh thanks! I thought they meant the same thing", "Let's not forget that OP is 17 and might not be a good or accurate historian.\n\nAs an RN who has cared for child cancer patients, people do tend to create their own interpretations of things when medicine and illness is concerned.", "Sometimes doctors can be pessimistic though. I am not saying this is the case now, but with my friend the doctors were telling her that her father had little chance to recover etc they were basically not being encouraging at all, on the other hand causing more anxiety to the family. Yet her father is recovering now.\n\nIn some instances it is family's support and determination that actually help save the patient. I mean it is not always the case and I am guessing maybe not that common, but it does mean there is a little chance the doctors may be wrong. So I feel like that's what gives some people that hope. Yes most times they do end up disappointed, but you never know.", "I adressed that with \"no matter how small the chance.\"", "From how she said it, if it works, her sister could live a full life. Granted, that chance is small, but if that was your child, you'd do anything to try and save their life. I'm not going to fault a parent for doing what they're biologically engineered to do- keep their children alive. I feel for OP, but if I were her, and I didn't spend the money and instead watched my loved one die, IDK if I could live with the guilt and that's something she needs to consider. Can she live with the consequences of not trying to save her sister's life.", "Your parents should look into if those doctors that accused them of lying are liable in any way", "i didn\u2019t see that damn", "Yeah the fact that they'd have to fly to another country to get the treatment is what's pinging my BS radar. I can't imagine any rational doctor saying, \"Put that dying child on a plane and fly them out to me,\" especially if there's not a guarantee she'll even survive the trip (she sounds very fragile)", "She's dying.  I would let my parents spend every last cent I had to spend one more minute with my sibling if they were dying.

They listened, they went over things patiently, they were absolute rockstars -- which couldn't have been easy, because my sister is absolutely bananas at the best of times.\n\nI was lucky - nephew was treatable, and we didn't have to hang out for long. But it made an impression. If they were anything less than encouraging and supportive, it would have spoken volumes.\n\nEspecially since OP already says it's a terminal illness, and because doctors dismissed symptoms, it was caught late.", "That's great, but this is a pediatric patient with terminal brain cancer who is so fragile they do not believe she will survive transit. It takes a lot for pediatric doctors to gently suggest against further treatment for children because children are known to be resilient and make surprising recoveries. There's that whole future ahead of them thing, too. Kids are hard to give up on in ways older adults are not.  It's just not common for them to give up if there's any sort of chance. \n\nWhich says that here, there very likely isn't one.

Mexico is notorious for fake treatments to scam people out of money.", "Wasting money on a one in a million chance is a bad idea.", "her cancer is uncurable. op shouldn\u2019t have to mess over her life for her sister? which i feel so bad for saying. her parents shouldn\u2019t force her into doing it. it going cause bad feeling toward the other sister.  but you did make an good point, but in the end.

It's an impossible situation and I would never want to make that decision. But OP isn't the AH for also thinking about her future too.

It is possible to have compassion for more than one person.", "There is a point at which you have to decide is it worth putting your child through that much pain for what? Two weeks of life?

I\u2019d rather spend time with my child than in a hospital.", "Good to know thanks!", "They didn't say they don't believe she could survive though, but that she could die. So there is a chance it can happen.\n\nI feel like when a someone is desperately trying to save someone else, even the little chance is enough to result in determination. The doctor didn't speak in absolutes, which gives hopes to the parents.\n\nI am also guessing after the doctors failed to diagnose her early on, the parents probably started trusting their judgment less. Could be wrong, but maybe that's why they are being even more stubborn about it.\n\nBut that's intresting to learn about children va adults, wasn't aware!", "Very true, I\u2019m a Mexican and we have a lot of doctors who shouldn\u2019t be doctors, there was a case a few years ago where a little kid with eye cancer in the left eye went into surgery to get it removed and they removed the WRONG EYE so now he\u2019s blind", "She will get an education.

Regardless of if the sister lives, if the parents take that money they\u2019re losing a child.\n\nI love my sister with everything I have - I\u2019d lie for her and die for her in a heartbeat.
