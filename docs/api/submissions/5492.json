Could you honestly live with that? Especially when you want to become a doctor to save lives...?\n\nI don't blame you for being upset or thinking negatively about losing that money. It's a very difficult situation that I would highly recommend speaking to a counselor about, or a therapist. You are only 17 and you have so many years of life ahead of you, money seriously means nothing. \n\nYour sisters life is far more valuable than money.

If she does have an estate and/or trust for you, your parents can't touch that money til you're eighteen *and* you've given permission. It may also be a trust that is specifically structured for college expenses - which would, again, negate your parents' claims that they have the right to access that money.

Time to go out for that ice cream together, time to talk to each other about your dreams, interests, memories you shared or creating new memories with laughable moments like reading a few AITA pages (except this one).

Would you feel differently about the money if you thought it might work? And are you sure you fully understand the situation? \n\nI'm just asking because I'm a doctor. I deal with patients and their families all the time who are dealing with serious diagnoses, cancers etc. And the ins and outs of prognosis, treatments etc are extremely complex especially for paediatric brain tumours. There are legitimate new treatments being developed all the time. And the nuances of 'experimental treatment' and what doctors do/don't mean when they suggest things like 'not to get your hopes up as she might not survive the trip' are in significant.

I understand OP's parents are grieving their daughter and are grasping as straws in the hopes she won't die (but she'll still die, and may be harmed by the bullshit \"cure\").
