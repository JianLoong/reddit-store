She can suck up the rest of the rent on her own if she\u2019s acting like that.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to break the lease, talk to the manager and report every single incident of her being unruly loud. This will build a good report in terms of breaking a lease.", "NTA girl needs to shut up while people are trying to sleep. So inconsiderate. Did the complaint get her to be quiet, at least?", "Definitely NTA. I'd start planning a way out or start playing dirty. Keep making anonymous calls. Report it to whoever you can.

You and your  other roommate should do everything you can to make her uncomfortable so maybe she will leave.", "NTA\n\nI... like she had her BF threaten you? Any chance you can get that recorded?

Then you and your other roommates will have an eviction.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve handled the escalation very reasonably.\n\nYou tried to talk to her about it, and she basically spit in your face.\n\nSo you tried to go to your property management about enforcing the lease, and they told you their hands were tied so you would need to call the cops.\n\nSo you called the cops.\n\nAre you TA for demanding she stop making you uncomfortable in your own home by following the rules she\u2019s contractually obligated to?

Keep calling - it worked when nothing else has.", "NTA\n\nI'm surprised no one else called before this", "NTA - And if she makes that much noise, do the same thing again.  Maybe when she figures out she can't carry on like a banshee at all hours, she'll go find someone else to annoy.  The \"getting her boyfriend to fight\" thing bothers me though.  That's threatening and harrassment and that should be reported to the cops directly and put on record.  I'd suggest getting at least an audio recording if that happens again.  You could then try for a restraining order that would keep him out of the apartment.  Although I suspect the banshee would really start to wail then.  Just a suggestion.", "NTA don\u2019t tell ANYONE", "Silence is extremely golden in this case.", "NTA Don\u2019t let her find out it was you though.", "NTA. Get the hell out if you can, this is beyond ridiculous", "Actually, this is a really good point.  Someone else said to record the boyfriend threatening OP, and I wanna springboard off both you guys.\n\nIf the roommate and her boyfriend are threatening and harassing, documentation may come in handy down the line.  Documentation such as a series of reports made to the landlord (so there\u2019s records of you taking proper steps and the landlord has the records as well), photos/videos/audio recordings of relevant incidents when possible, potentially even keeping record of various incidents (just a log that documents when and a short summary of events).", "This complex is next to impossible to get out of a lease.

She\u2019s already back screaming and hollering tonight but it\u2019s not 10 yet.", "There was a previous altercation, not physical. She recorded it. I did not record it because I wasn\u2019t planning on it escalating beyond just asking them to be quiet for the 5th time that night, and they got defensive.

Tell NO ONE. Not your friend, not your lover, not your mother. Because if you do, it WILL be found out.", "We would love to move out, but this place is next to impossible to get out of a lease.

This was almost a year ago when I signed the lease. Friendship ended on my side about 2 weeks in because of the constant disrespect and not having any consideration for others.", "Oh I already took away everything that belongs to me from the kitchen. And keep my room locked at all times. Can\u2019t move out until the end of July and can\u2019t get out of the lease.

If you want to keep it a secret, don\u2019t tell anyone.  Keep calling too.  NTA.", "I think you have to get your other roommate and complain to the manager together.

In fact, perhaps you can warn her that you\u2019ll call the cops if her screaming continues and make a call in front of her", "Oh ugh, how disappointing! Keep on it with them - make it far more trouble for managers to ignore your issue than deal with it, by making complaints (polite and truthful) and logging all of it. Record the screaming and send it to them via email. Find out the laws in your state/country about disturbances when renting and highlight it for them.

Her getting evicted doesn\u2019t affect me or our other roommate at all.", "Next time I plan on confrontation, I am 100% having someone else here, preferably my father because of the boyfriend threatening me."]}
