It not working? \n\nJudging from his response to everything else I\u2019m inclined not to believe he was \u201cbaby trapped,\u201d but rather he just does what he can to skirt any shred of responsibility.", "He was not raped. Messing with someone's birth control is not rape. Rape is a brutal crime. No birth control is 100%. Even sterilization fails at times. It sounds like the condom failed and claiming to be baby trapped is the IP's way of not taking responsibility for his own actions", "Exactly. I've been dancing around that description, just incase OP wasn't ready to face that reality yet, but it's true. Crime punishable with a custodial sentence in the uk, even if they can't get a rape charge. (There's been cases of convicted rapes but others for \"stealthing\", coercive control and various types of assault)", "So weird. I can see it from your link, but not in the feed.", "That's fair. I myself in this case will stand by the assumption because again I believe it's also fair. \n\nI understand your points, but I personally just think it's irrelevant to the story and even if one of those possibilities turns out to be true it really doesn't make him any less of an asshole", "OP saying his thought here doesn\u2019t mean he projected, voiced, or did anything with those feeling actively towards his daughter. He didn\u2019t have to be close with his daughter growing up to be a bad father either. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially calling negative feelings about the child conceived form his raped while making the **assumption** that he actively showed those feeling to his daughter.", "This is a male not the mother", "She's not responsible for her mothers actions but you no, and I doubt OP blames her for them but she's a byproduct of her actions and a living breathing embodiment of that. A reminder of what happened, constantly. Real easy for those lines of resentment to be blurred in situations like this.\n\nIf you're forced to do something, against your will, it takes your freedoms, it makes life massively harder constantly, would you resent it? Almost certainly, because it's the natural human response to that scenario. \n\nMost of us can't imagine resenting our kids but most of us also couldn't imagine having zero say in the creation of our kids either. One thing to accidentally get pregnant but a total other to be forced into conceiving after taking steps to prevent it happening. \n\nBecause of that in his mind, the baby became the burden. The baby is why he had to give up his freedoms. The baby is why his life wasn't the same as his peers. The baby wasn't supposed to be born. Remember he was 15 when those feelings started, 15yr olds aren't usually emotionally mature or rational. It should be the mother he hates but the child is the symbol of all he lost and it's very very easy for them kinds of emotions to spread.\n\nYou can't be an arsehole for how you feel, can't help that, you can only be an areehole for how you handle how you feel. For resenting his daughter at some point? I can't relate but i empathise. For letting it get worse and worse over 22yrs? Yeah arsehole. \n\nI will say though if my son was in his situation, I as his parent have a responsibility to help him. Starting with therapy. Idk if op's parents/guardians tried or not, but if they didn't, they let him down too\n\nETA: everything is tied together in one big ball in this scenario. Some ppl would hate the mum but love the baby instantly. It's not the same for everyone. & it's really common for people who were forced into parenthood to really struggle with bonding, resentment, regret etc. at least for a little while. They just usually get intervention much sooner\n\nETA x2: when I said \"the baby became the burden\" etc I meant it as the internalised thought process on where OP's emotions got directed. Not that anything is the babies fault. I think I've explained better a few comments down. Cheers to the commentor that pointed this out to me :)", "Has nothing to do with the aita question but everything to do with this post, especially the comment I replied to. Have you commented that on every single comment slaughtering him and calling him an arsehole because he resented his daughter? Most of them have been brutal, because people judged on what wasn't part of it. He didn't ask \"aita for resenting my daughter for most of her life?\" Did he? No. He attempted to give background and it backfired and got him a massive amount of unjustified shit.. when with the little, tiny, detail he shared after, the perspective is totally different.  So no; it's not relevant to the judgement he asked for but it's 100% relevant for the judgement he's got that he didn't ask for. For example: \"I'd also like to know how you came to the conclusion you were baby trapped?\" He explained how, and continued getting repetitive shit for it because people didn't see his explanation. \n\nIn my actual comment I've gently gave him some advice for him and his daughter and quite blatantly declared he's NTA for the ring", "I'd choose to believe someone in a scenario like this. It's a case of a person speaking of what's essentially an assault. Could he have lied to lessen the backlash? Yeah but could it also have been a genuine scenario? Yeah. This shit happens all the time and it's horrible. (And stupid because a baby can't save even a good relationship, let alone a kids one)", "The he would just be financially responsible for a child not in his life. \n\nEvery child is owed 2 parents. Period.", "You\u2019re making the assumption that he actively projected those feeling onto his daughter. OP stating his emotions now doesn\u2019t mean he projected them onto his daughter, nor it doesn\u2019t mean that he was a bad father. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially calling him an asshole for having negative feeling about the product of his rape. While making the assumption, that he was a shit father.", "Do you understand that stealthing is rape? What happened to him is a version of stealthing. It\u2019s rape. There\u2019s a reason why in places, there are laws against stealthing.", "It 100% is rape. He consented to protected sex. Contraceptive sabotage forces one partner into unprotected sex, resulting in reproductive coercion. This is illegal, and classed as rape under UK law. \n\nAll rape is brutal. It does not require severe physical injury to count as r*pe. rape is rape. \n\nYes, OP needs to take responsibility *regarding his actions with his daughter*. He took responsibility when he put the condom on.\n\nedited to correct UJ to UK.", "You\u2019re correct, and I see that now. I made an assumption that he was using that backstory in an attempt to justify his decision to not replace his daughters ring, because I didn\u2019t really understand why those particular details were relevant to the story otherwise.\n\nBut you\u2019re correct, I made an assumption and I didn\u2019t have enough information to make that judgement.\n\nI apologize", "read the comment I was responding to\u2026", "No the child is NOT the reason for anything the mother is. It\u2019s clear you are just as much an AH as OP is", "He IS an asshole for resenting his daughter. The hate he has for his child is awful but he didn\u2019t deserve to be assaulted. Two things can be true at once. I see we\u2019re going to disagree no matter what but I appreciate your perspective.", "again, I stand by that it has nothing to do with the incident at hand. there was literally no reason to bring it up, none.", "Stealthing is deception, not rape. Too different things. Both wrong, but different.", "Did I say it was the child's fault? No. \nAt no point is it her fault. In no way, shape, or form is it her fault. I've said repeatedly his feelings are understandable but should have been confronted years ago. He was a child for crying out loud. You cannot expect a child to think rationally. \n\nI explained how and why resenting a child you didn't want can (and does) happen, especially in this kind of situation and why I empathise that he ever felt that way. Even if it's something I couldn't ever feel myself. I'm a parent, I was a teen parent. I get how hard losing some freedoms to raise a child is. Hell I struggled a lot with postnatal and all sorts when my first was born. Did I resent her? No, did I resent what I missed? A bit, sometimes. What I didn't do though, was let it eat at me. I got help, listened to others perspectives and figure out that having a kid doesn't take everything away either. I don't think OP ever had that kind of intervention.\n\nCan I empathise with him being 37 and still feeling that way? No. Do I get that there's a huge amount of undealt with trauma here that needs actual intervention? Absolutely. \n\nI can't call someone an arsehole for an emotional response to a trauma. I can call someone an arsehole for not dealing with it. & if that makes me an arsehole, so be it.", "It's a human response to resent things we are forced to do, we can't help it. We can't help any emotion or feeling in fact and with so much of his daughter's existence being out of his control, them feelings being there is normal response to have. The only bit that makes him an arsehole is leaving it so long to fester and grow. Had it been dealt with years ago, I'm sure he'd have had a different experience. \n\nI know for sure if my son came home to me at 15 and told me he had sex (legal age of consent in my country is 16 so a 15yr old isn't a wild concept) and the girl had poked holes in the condom so he couldn't leave her, id have him in therapy. Immediately. OP doesn't seem to have had that when he needed it most, which is really sad. Hopefully he can do something about it now and prevent it going further. Him and his daughter are both young enough to have a real shot at a solid relationship eventually. \n\nHey, it's great to not always agree with people. Opens up doors to much better conversations and perspectives :) have a lovely day (or night depending on where you are)", "He just voiced and vented his emotions. Who cares if they\u2019re relevant to the post. I\u2019m sure in some the various \u201cjudgements\u201d you\u2019ve made on this sub, you\u2019ve said some irrelevant shit like making an assumption about shit that wasn\u2019t stated in the post", "It\u2019s crazy there are laws calling stealthing rape, and you\u2019re fighting me on this.\n\n[google link](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=is+stealthing+rape)", "1) you can\u2019t differentiate between Two, Too, and To, can you? \n2) (or Two if you need some help) I was once stealthed, and I got chlamydia from it. I agreed to protected sex and they took off the condom during sex. I got an sti from that and I didn\u2019t know for about a year. That seriously impacts fertility. Do you not think that\u2019s rape? I agreed to a specific form of sex, my consent was violated. That is rape. Stealthing is rape.", "You constantly said the child\n\u2018the baby is why\u2019. That is blaming the child.", "There\u2019s a massive difference between resenting something out of your control and actively making a child feel unwanted. You do not get to project any of your negative feelings onto a literal kid who has had no choice in anything, (cause no fuckin person wants to hang around parents that don\u2019t want them.) \nYknow what\u2019s shittier than being forced to be a parent? Being a child born to people that don\u2019t want you.", "Aah then you've misunderstood what I was trying to say. I meant in his head the baby became the focus point of why his life wasn't the way he wanted. It's a really common thing to happen that the causation causes the resentment but the outcome is the direction the resentment goes. \n\nI'm not sure how else to word it, but say you get told you have to wash the dishes and you don't want to. Some people will be mad at who said the dishes need to be washed, some people will be mad at who messed the dishes up and others will straight up be mad at the dishes even though they didn't mess themselves up. It's even more common to happen in people who have a traumatic experience in childhood. The anger is misplaced and you can't blame them for being angry, only for where they unleashed it.\n\nI can't quite explain it, I can't think of an analogy that makes as much sense as I need it to, but that's what I was trying to get at. He unconsciously aimed his pain at the wrong person\n\nETA: we don't know if he's kept this internalised or if it impacted how he raised his daughter either. Some people can sit with this kind of shit and nobody will ever know. This could have been the first time he's ever mentioned it outwardly", "You are completely correct in that. Which is why he's an arsehole for not working through it all much much sooner. Whilst he was a child himself it was his parents/guardians responsibility to help him work through it all, once he got to adulthood he could have worked through it and realised it's not his daughters fault she was born or the parenthood that was thrown onto him either. \n\nHe's had time, lots of time, to change that. People have a tendency to not be able to look at their own actions as the problem and focus only on their own feelings - good or bad. Sometimes it takes an outsiders perspective to say \"ok, that's a valid way to have felt but it's not healthy. You can change it\" & im really hoping OP doesn't just go on the defensive and feel like he's being attacked and actually realises that even now him and his daughter can unpack it and process it all."]}
