It is not something that is no big deal and an extra five minutes. It is minimum an extra hour (on top of the time you are already spending with Jenny). \n\nYou are NTA for saying No. \n\nIf you did say Yes she needs to pay you by the hour for the babysitting time (including waiting in the car), give you money in advance for snacks, and for the car mileage and fuel.", "Nta. Why would you even do that to yourself? Anna is her mothers problem not yours. If Anna is that rude, i wouldnt do it even if i get paid. The more reason, Shell treat you like a driver.", "NTA. You have no obligation whatsoever, it's a lot of extra work distance-wise and you already know she wouldn't listen or reimburse you if you told her that her daughter made a mess. She should have asked first and then enrolled her kid depending on the reply.\n\nGood on you to be upfront about it and actually give reasons. Don't let them force you to do something, you bring up very good points on why not to do it!", "NTA. good on u for saying no at such a young age!", "NTA- Your mom never should have said that you might pick this cousin up without talking to you first or at least finding out if she was going to pay you like the other Aunt does. If her kid is such a problem, she shouldn't bank on others wanting to do anything with them for free. If you are not willing to deal with this kid's disrespect or tantrums, then just say no. Your Aunt shouldn't be signing her kid up for things in the hopes that others will pick up the slack for her.", "Woah, hold on.. \n\nFirstly, LOL. One of the easiest NTA\n\nJust because you do so for someone else doesn't you do so for everyone else.\n\n\"She said since I pick up Jenny... I should puck up Anna too?\" \n\nOh hell no, what kind of entitlement is this?\nAnd furthermore.\n\n\"She only signed up Anna because she was under the impression you'd take responsibility of her daughter??\" \n\nWow, that's uhm... what's the term... Sh!tbaggery behavior right there. \n\nThis is not your problem, she isnt entitled to your \"aid\", these are choices you should determine for yourself.\n\nI'd distance myself from folks like that, zero personal responsibility and brazen enough to rope you into their shenanigans without shame, but with entitlement.\n\nWhat an awful grown human. Don't be like her.", "NTA You aren\u2019t responsible for taking care of your nieces. Because you help out one aunt, you don\u2019t need to help out the other one too.

Did you make an agreement or said something which might have given the impression that you would be down to do that?\n\nHowever, if no promises were made, then I don't really see an issue with you saying no.
