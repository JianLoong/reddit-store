For context my Mom quit her job recently and has been getting money from my father (48m) for expenses. I am a university student home for the summer working to save money for living expenses for the school year. $1000 is 2 weeks of full time work for me. I said no when she brought it up because this is something she should be discussing with my father and asking him for money, she doesn\u2019t want to do that because he will get really upset. I said I don\u2019t want to pay that because I don\u2019t know if she will pay me back because she doesn\u2019t have a job. She seemed upset by this and said she couldn\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t trust her word. I told her, i\u2019m only 19, i\u2019ve never even been asked to lend someone $100 let alone $1000 and it\u2019s not her it\u2019s the amount. \n\nNot even 2 minutes after she first brought it up she was telling me she would remember this in the future when I ask her for anything. She then started talking about the McDonald\u2019s coffee and muffin she got me yesterday and saying that I owe her gas money for her occasionally driving me to work, or the times she\u2019s taken me out for dinner. Also how she used to buy me more clothes in middle school than she thought i needed. I thought that was extremely petty to throwback in my face because I was under the impression those were gifts and just things parents do not something I owed her, especially the things from 10 years ago like the clothes. She\u2019s the type of person to day dream about taking her siblings and nieces on expensive vacations and she always gets the tab at a dinner with them, she\u2019s even got the tab for them sometimes when she\u2019s not even at the dinner! \n\nThis really hurt me as she has always said she would be okay if I wanted to stay and live with her for the rest of my life. I know if i actually took her up on that (which I will not be doing) I would have to pay rent and bills. But didn\u2019t know that would be starting now while i\u2019m still legally a dependent. I also think it\u2019s important to say the only bills she currently pays for is her phone bill. all of the daily house stuff is from my dad. So this isn\u2019t her needed help with the household necessities at all.\n\nHonestly her bringing up that petty stuff made me actually think she wouldn\u2019t pay me back, like she was already justifying how I did in fact owe her it. I didn\u2019t say this though.\n\nSorry for the long ramble i\u2019m just extremely hurt.

She is clearly a user and abuser, dont give her a penny. It's her obligation as a parent to take care of her child. Give her money once and she will keep taking for a lifetime", "100% NTA\n\nMy heart goes out to you. You are 100% within your rights to decline loaning anyone money, even your mom. There are so many red flags here. A mom asking a college aged kid for money. Not working. The threatening way she responded when she got a No. In no way do you \u201cowe\u201d your mom for money spent while she\u2019s raised you. She\u2019s the one who chose to have you. You don\u2019t owe her for even yesterday with her choice to get you a muffin. That choice was made to give without you agreeing to give her anything in return.\n\nIs there a way you can live with your dad the rest of summer? This is not a healthy environment for you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever you sound like your family is in a precarious situation financially. I strongly urge you to learn more about how to manage money, bank accounts, etc. That will help you make good decisions and know what is normal. You could google financial literacy for good basic information. Many banks, like Chase, also have good free resources on financial literacy. Now is the time to learn, as money only gets more complicated as you get older. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. My personal rule, don\u2019t loan money to family. Never ends well. If you are able to gift money to her, that\u2019s great.", "NTA. Your mother is being petty and childish. $1000 is a significant amount for any person, but especially for someone in your position. \n\nAs far as the support she provided you while you were growing up: that was not a transaction to be repaid. That was an obligation she took on when she decided to become a parent.", "NTA. Don't pay, or this will be just the first amount of your savings that you'll never see back. \n\nThe fact that your mother doesn't want you to tell your father, doesn't mean you can't talk to your father and ask for advice.  In fact, in your shoes, I would tell the story to your father, even if you perhaps promised not to. If you keep your mouth shut, your father will find out later anyway, when your mother has got herself into more financial trouble and then your father might be mad at you for not warning him what's going on. Your mother's day dreams may have gotten her into this sad situation and now she is dreaming that you are going to save her... Yes, your relationship with your mother will suffer if you decline and/or talk to your dad, but that's not your fault, as your mother has brought you into this difficult position.", "NTA, sorry but who asks their 19 year old child for money? If she needs money that bad she can ask your dad regardless if he\u2019ll be mad or not or she can get a job like a normal adult. If she continues to try and guilt trip you I would confront your dad. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be happy that she asked you for $1000", "NTA.  I just want to point out that\n\n> She\u2019s the type of person to day dream about taking her siblings and nieces on expensive vacations and she always gets the tab at a dinner with them, she\u2019s even got the tab for them sometimes when she\u2019s not even at the dinner!\n\nIs probably why she is so taken aback at your refusal. If you know shes a share and share alike type of person, shes probably really hurt to be in a position of need and have even you refuse her.", "NTA - TRUST YOUR GUT!!! You know why you think her excuses seem to be preparation for her not paying you back? Because it absolutely is. Also, unless your Dad is a jerk, her hiding spending from him is super shady. It could lead to a bad financial position for him, or she might have bought something she doesn't want him to see. Either way, never lend money to ANYONE unless you can happily gift them that amount, because people often won't pay you back.", "Nta first off. Second of all\u2026you\u2019re 19.

You owe her NOTHING financially for that period of your life. \n\n\nAnything going forward is between you and your parents.  If your parents are still married and she's trying to borrow from you and keep it a secret from your father,  she's gotten herself into a hole whether it's credit card debt, gambling,  or something else.  It might hurt your relationship with your mother, but it might save them financially if you talk to your father.  You need to decide what you can live with.  \n\nIf they are separated or divorced,  they need to negotiate this between themselves.  \n\nFor yourself,  you need to change all your financial passwords.  Then run a credit check on yourself to make sure she hasn't opened any accounts in your name.

Don't let her irresponsibility ruin your responsibility.", "Certainly NTA. \n\nYou are being responsible with your money and she isn\u2019t, this is not your mess to clean up. You, her child, should not have to be a parent to your parent. Try your best to ignore her petty comments (easier said than done) and keep doing what you\u2019re doing!

Ever. If you can always play it down. Otherwise she will ask again. She will pull out all those pity me cards again. She will get increasingly difficult.. especially if you hand over the money\n\nYou're not the arsehole here, your mum is. \nIf she wants you to be contributing to household costs and paying your phone bill, she needs to correctly communicate that with you and come up with an affordable and agreed regular amount. She can't just throw things she's previously paid for in your face, especially things from a decade ago. That's very manipulative. \n\nDon't put yourself in an awkward position between them, especially if she's being evasive and secretive (in not telling your dad about the cc bill). If he finds out then you have essentially omitted important info and paid for it on her behalf you're pretty much complicit. I'm not saying she's in the wrong for having a credit card bill but it seems odd that she would rather take the money off her child than the other adult that pays for household running costs. \n\nThe way she pays for the tabs for other people makes her seem a little on the wreckless side with money too. \n\nLook after yoursef OP", "Nta. Never ever lean people a bigger sum of money, not even loved ones, especially not loved ones.", "NTA, talk to your father. She is trying to hide her behavior from your father, this is the sign of an abuser. She wants you alone and helpless, TELL YOUR DAD!", "Nta.  Don't loan her any money. She definitely isn't planning on paying you back. Who does that kind of shit?  Move out as soon as possible and definitely tell your father.", "Children should not be responsible for their upbringing expenses.  That\u2019s what is called parenting \nShame on her.  \nShe a total ass.", "Your mom's behavior and request is a red flag. She should be going to her husband for help, not you, and her reaction is way over the top. This screams minor desperation.\n\nBecause of this, I suspect your mom has bad reasons for needing this $1000, and the reason she's going to you and not your dad is that your dad would call her out on those reasons, because, being older and more experienced with finances, he probably would ask questions that you don't know to ask about this $1000 request. \n\nFor the sake of your dad and your mom's financial situation, I recommend telling your dad that your mom asked for a $1000 loan from you. Your mom should not be hiding a $1000 deficit from your dad, her financial manager. He needs to get to the bottom of why she's a thousand bucks in the hole.\n\nNTA. Stand your ground, tell your dad.\n\nETA: the only other explanation I can think of for her reaction is if there is abuse present between your parents.
