Every time, this social interaction just feels so disingenuous and contrived and leaves me feeling kind of uncomfortable. \n\nI should add, this is the first time I've lived in a building with a 24/7 concierge, but other buildings I've lived in with concierges only acknowledged me when I addressed them directly. I get that the concierges in my apartment are  just doing their jobs and they provide a level of security for the building, but I find their style of interaction to be over the top. \n\nOne time, I came back one time from a week long vacation, and I suppose the concierge didnt recognize me because I walked in with my boyfriend after he scanned into the building, walked by the desk without checking in (as is apparently required for guests), and she yelled at me from across the lobby \"Excuse me! Um!! Excuse me!!!!\" and I had to let her know that I live there by holding up my building key fob in order for her to stop pestering me. \n\nIn order to avoid these interactions, I now walk around the buildings with earbuds in (the universal symbol for please-dont-talk-to-me) and don't make eye contact when passing the desk. I figured they would pick up on the non-vebal cue that I'd like to be left alone but my most recent interaction with them demonstrates that they haven't picked up on it:\n\nThe other day, I walked in the building with my boyfriend and he greeted the concierge at the front desk. I gave her a slight reflexive wave as well to be polite and she responded sarcastically: \"Wow!!! So you decided to notice me today! First time ever!\" or something to that effect. I just laughed awkwardly and walked on. \n\nTo be clear, I don't feel this same way about all service workers, literally only these concierges at this particular building. I  greet the housekeeping staff in my building as well as the concierge at my office building, particularly because we pass each other in such close proximity. These particular concierges at my apartment building get on my nerves because the interactions always feel so forced, almost like its a requirement for me to interact with them and get their blessing before I go to my apartment where I live. I wish they would understand that a lot of times after a long day of work or early in the morning when I am leaving for work, I am not a complete human being and don't feel like having yet another forced interaction. But maybe that's just my social anxiety. \n\nHowever, this last interaction has made me feel even more awkward and anxious entering and leaving my building and has got me wondering whether I'm an asshole for not wanting to greet the concierge every time I exit and enter my apartment. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**EDIT: I should add the concierge desk is about 50 feet from the front doors, so I am not walking directly in front of them while trying to not make eye contact, but more like trying to slip by unnoticed. Might not make a huge difference in the AITA analysis because they are still clearly trying to make an effort to communicate with me every time I enter the the building,  albeit from a greater distance.**", "created_utc": 1694750634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16j34v9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_greet_my_apartments/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's like a fast-food person being told to ask if you want to upsize your drink. They don't like it either, but they're trying to do a job and you're an asshole in return.\n\nI would say the concierge is a slight asshole for the sarcastic remark, but it sounds like you're on their last nerve.", "All you need to do is wave/nod.\n\nHowever that snarky Oh you noticed me was way over the line. \n\nSo I'm going ESH because of that... is that just one person in particular? \n\nWhat are they ordered to do as their job?", "YTA. Honestly, they\u2019re just doing their job. I think they\u2019d likely get complaints if they just ignored people. \n\nI think you\u2019ve built it up to something bigger than it needs to be. We\u2019re talking about a max of thirty seconds of your day to just be kind to someone.", "YTA I\u2019m the most introverted person ever and I have social anxiety and I even I can manage at least a \u201cthanks\u201d or a \u201cyou too\u201d or at minimum a fake smile in these situations. You are just bringing attention to yourself by being so standoffish. I don\u2019t think they should have made the comment about being the first time you noticed them but I think you are worse in this situation.", "NTA\n\nTL;DR I\u2019m a former concierge and supervisor for concierge security. You\u2019re not sitting at the desk to greet or talk to every person.\n\nIn a standard sized condo building there\u2019s 14 suites per floor and sometimes 30 standard floors with at least 2 people in each (assuming some units are 1 person and others are families) that 840 people in a regular sized building. There is no expectation for the concierge to talk to all of them or greet all of them. \n\nI\u2019m assuming their shifts are 12h blocks if she sees you in the morning and after work, so I\u2019d bet she\u2019s doing this because it helps her stay awake. Regardless, all types of security, especially concierge, are specifically told that if someone doesn\u2019t want to talk to you and isn\u2019t breaking a rule, just leave them. \n\nIt\u2019s bad customer service to continuously hound the property manager\u2019s clients (including tenants and residents) and concierge and security is primarily a customer service job", "I'm really shocked everyone is voting you the asshole. \n\nIt was wildly inappropriate for her to not only be so condescending and passive aggressive (at her job) but to choose to do so (1) in front of your guest and (2) while you're in your home. \n\nThey say never punish the behavior you want to see and she did just that. It's such ignorant behavior. I doubt her shaming you in front of an audience has now made you want to interact with her more. \n\nNTA", "I typically think that this sort of thing is a small problem that is better ignored in hopes it goes away. \n\nBut once they make snide comments like \u201cSo, you decided to notice me today\u201d, they have crossed a serious line. \n\nI also don\u2019t really like superficial friendliness and contrived greetings, but the are usually innocent. \n\nIf they know or should know that they are bothering you, and turn it into a spat, it is too much. \n\nI think you need to tell them that you are sure other people like the friendliness but that you would like to just come and go. I don\u2019t think you can ask for behavior to be changed until you have mentioned it. \n\nI think you should also note the snide comment in a written message to the building saying in a very measured tone that you should be allowed to come and go in peace and do not want to be hassled or face a hostile environment from the doorman because you are not friendly enough for him.\n\nI am sure a lot of the other residents live him and he doesn\u2019t know why you don\u2019t. But that is not a license to harass you.", "YTA.  It takes less than nothing to say \u201chow are you\u201d or \u201chello.\u201d  Just get over yourself.", "NTA.  You don't have to wave at someone who didn't even recognize a long time resident when you came back from vacation.  You have no obligation to say hi or bye to this person every time you pass them.", "NTA Report this to management. I agree with the close proximity thing. If you aren't close enough to touch each other, there is no need to interact. You could also just make eye contact and nod.", "NTA I live in a doorman building and the constantly having to navigate social interactions just to go home or when you\u2019re running out the door late to catch a train or plane is maddening. The over the top greetings feel like an inside joke among the doormen, who can be totally sexist, at times. I\u2019m a complete extrovert and I appreciate the guys who work in my building, in fact I offered assistance when they were considering going on strike and have pushed management to stop requiring them to show positive covid tests or doctors notes to take sick leave, BUT it\u2019s all a bit much sometimes, especially with the sarcastic bullshit. I pay enough for this shitty place, leave me be. Your building\u2019s management also sucks\u2014 a policy of addressing every tenant every time they move does not a happy tenant make. I\u2019d challenge some of the people saying YTA to live with this shit for awhile. (One of my favorites is if you for instance get caught in the rain or snow and show up wet or looking disheveled there will be a whole \u201cyou forgot your umbrella!\u201d Or \u201cdid you forget to check the weather?\u201d routine. I just want to go the fuck home and you aren\u2019t a comedian)", "YTA. \n\nJust a short greeting/nod/wave is the polite thing to do. \nNot doing that is indeed rude, and it's not cool to work somewhere, where clients/customer behave as if you aren't there.", "NTA.

Gimme british 'ignore me til I initiate interaction' customer service any day.", "YTA\n\nYou think this person is doing this for a good time?  No.  The building manager has very likely drilled it in to greet everyone, every time.  Unstiffen your neck to give them a nod and get on with your day.", "NTA.  They are likely required to do it, so they aren't an AH for that, but the sarcastic comment was rude.  The earbud method seems like a very good way of solving the issue.  You could also give a smile as you are passing (that is my method of interacting with people when I am not feeling it), but you are not an AH for this.\n\nAlso, the key fob thing is them just doing their job by not letting potentially random people in.", "NTA. These concierges would piss me off too. It would be one thing if they were just offering a polite and quick greeting each time, but it honestly sounds like they're harassing you. You come home with takeout and they literally call out to you across the lobby, \"Oooh, what did you bring me??\" That is SO unprofessional and it would annoy me so much. As an introvert, my home is my sanctuary and someone forcing me twice a day to have yet ANOTHER stupid and inane interaction against my will would make me want to claw their eyes out.", "NTA. I feel you. I barely even want to acknowledge my own family when I walk in the door at the end of a long day at work. I probably would have told the concierge (who all must recognize you by now) to not take it personally if I don\u2019t seem friendly at the end of the day and that I\u2019m worse than Grumpy Cat. Inject a little humor in with boundary-setting and maybe it\u2019ll all work out?", "Nta asshole bud. They are not entitled to your acknowledgement day in and day out. It would be nice and socially polite, however, not necessary to not be an asshole. You will definitely seem standoffish, but that's not a license for them to be rude to you.", "NTA, because what they are doing is not just greeting you, they are being intrusive and unprofessional.  You can either just wave hi and not engage and hope they get the hint, or talk to them and set a boundary (\u201cI appreciate you, but it feels intrusive when you comment on what I\u2019m doing, can we just stick with hello?\u201d) or\u2026 complain to the management company.  I\u2019m generally not inclined to complain about people doing their jobs, but that \u201cso you decided to notice me today\u201d comment is really over the top it might drive me to it.", "NTA\n\nThe issue isn't that they are greeting you but that they are being weird in the way that they are doing it. It's fine not to like that person whether they are being paid to greet you or not. If that were my job I would simply ignore you back because I'd have picked up on the clear social clue that you don't like to talk to me.", "YTA You don\u2019t need to respond with the same energy, but greeting your concierge is the courteous thing to do. It\u2019s about respecting someone who provides you a service. Just say hi and continue walking.", "NTA! Please, for some of us it\u2019s already hard enough to interact with the people we absolutely have to. I would hate to dread going back to my own home because of this pushy person. If I don\u2019t need anything from them or they anything from me, there\u2019s no need to talk (unless of course we both wanted to witch is not the case)", "YTA , I get it I am an introvert myself but a basic greeting is just the minimum on respecting someone .\nJust a nod a hi will suffice, you don't need to speak about life and get close , he is doing his job and seems quite friendly .", "NTA i get it, not an awful person just dont feel like it, that\u2019s fine. I get the same way, some days I\u2019ll talk your ear off, and want to know all about your day, others I just don\u2019t want to anything and you are part of it. It\u2019s like the equivalent of a telemarketer, \u201cHey Mrs. Smith how are you doing on this beautiful day\u201d, I don\u2019t really know you, we don\u2019t have that kind of relationship, relax, you could say \u201chi\u201d, you could wave, that\u2019ll be fine I don\u2019t need the \u201cover the top\u201d. That being said, they are doing their job and some companies micromanage to the point where they tell their employees exactly what they have to say, so they may be doing exactly what they\u2019re instructed to do, so you can\u2019t really fault them. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing and they\u2019ll badmouth you behind your back and you can be pissed about them and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s OK.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult, and it's like you're being monitored by your parents\n\nImagine if you were single and had hook ups.

Man is simply doing his job, and tbh with how he once did not recognize you and tried to stop you it sounds like he is doing a fair job at that.\n\nAnyways, he is not trying to do any harm or such, simply trying to be a nice guy in his own ways, my thoughts were more leaning towards that if you are wearing headphones or earbuds anyways, how much does it hurt to simply give a small wave, im sure he's plenty content with something like that.\n\nIf it bothers you actually this much to a certain level, just be honest. People rather be told compared to being given a cold shoulder, but that might be a local thing for me, we dutch people are very direct to one another after all so over here it would be totally normal to politely ask to stop bothering me.\n\nAnyways, once again I feel like you are making a problem out of something which is simply a person trying to be kind. If you don't like his comments or greetings then just talk to him and ask him politely, no need to be an AH about it yourself, tis all about the way how you say it:)", "NAH\nThey probably have a requirement to speak to everybody butnthe sarcastic remark about being noticed was uncalled for.

They see you trying to sneak into the building like a thief & you get offended when they ask if you live in there? Just wave or say hello.

That way you don\u2019t have to have the same conversation with a ton of people?", "Well, if it's more then one concierge then you might have to talk to more of them to get it through, but once again, no harm is done in any of their gestures so. Just try and have a talk with them about it, worst that could happen is them staying friendly.", "Wtf you talking about with your forced interaction ? Get out here, ya'll are so dehumanize... when your concierge greet you, not answering back is a big asshole move. How selfish and arrogant you must be to not even have the decency to wave at another person to at least acknowledge their existence? You got me effed up", "Embarrassing.", "For sure which is why I said to talk to the building manager. OP can verify that indeed it's part of their job (or not) and relate how the snarky comment felt rude and uncalled for.", "Nodding at someone takes all your social energy? Concierge didn\u2019t need to say anything, but had OP acknowledged them as a human any time before this it wouldn\u2019t have happened.

A nod or a slight bow to acknowledge someone (especially one you see daily) costs nothing.

Get tf over yourself.", "So you are an AH too.", "Anxiety is not an excuse for awful manners. I've had anxiety and depressive disorder and panic attacks my entire life but I don't treat kind people like shit because I'm too sensitive to respond to their kindness.

Forcing me to interact with every human that comes within 50 feet of me is not polite. I do not exist to entertain you. \n\nI was in the service industry for a long time and any good service worker learns fast who wants a lot of attention and who'd rather you not talk to them unless it's necessary, and there's nothing wrong with being either kind of person until you decide to make your preference a passive aggressive problem for other people. \n\nI don't say hi to the overly enthusiastic station manager who's holding his own comedy show at my metro station every morning. I'm glad he's having a good time, but he's exhausting and I've got shit to do. \n\nJust because the concierge's boss is probably forcing them to talk to everyone doesn't mean the residents who pay money to live there also need to be forced to talk to the staff 2-10 times a day or be \"rude\".", "You don\u2019t understaaaaand. Waving drains her so much! /s", "Their job is based on pay, not goodwill. \n\nIf they react positively to it, that's great. But could be seen as favoritism or bribery if there's too much goodwill exchanged. If they react negatively, then that's passive aggression and spitefulness, which isn't professional. \n\nOP shouldn't have to play into pointless societal posturing just to get to their living space just because some people (even if it's a majority) ego's are so fragile they need constant validation.", "It\u2019s not the same doing it once or twice when required.

I suffered from horrible depression, anxiety, CPTSD, and even psychosis to the point of being involuntarily hospitalized and I still managed to control myself in public and be kind to service workers, even if I had just had a breakdown that morning.\n\nIt's called being accountable for yourself and seeing working people as human beings and not some NPC spitting out dialogue\n\nIt takes nothing to offer a single nod of acknowledgement; you don't have to celebrate them or even reciprocate with the same energy", "Same", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
