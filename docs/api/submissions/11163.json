All in all ten girls were coming. It required a flight and obviously lodging as well. I decided to find the Airbnb myself and put it on my credit card and have everyone pay me for their share. \n\nAbout two weeks before the trip I had a medical issue that would require surgery. At this point I was very panicked and anxiety ridden. I was freaking out that I wouldn\u2019t be okay for my wedding and concerned about my bachelorette as well. A day or two before my surgery I sent a message to the girls that I would most likely not be able to go on the trip. I told them that I would get 50% of the Airbnb back and that I would call the airlines to explain the situation and try to get them their money back. I also sent a message stating that I would know if I could go for sure or not the day after my surgery.\n\nMy surgery went well and the issue was less severe than I originally thought. I was very excited that everything was working out and the day after my surgery  I texted that the trip was still on. Two of my friends informed me that they had already cancelled their flights.\n\nI felt really upset at first because they were good friends and I felt guilty because my text did imply that the trip wouldn\u2019t be happening. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t just wait until after my surgery to say anything but I was in a bad state of mind and overreacting to just about everything so I send the wall of text about cancelling. As I stated before however I did say that I would know for sure after my surgery whether we could go or not.\n\nThey didn\u2019t end up coming on the trip but I had a great time with the eight other girls. When I got back home I got a text from the two of them asking for their share of the Airbnb back. I was honestly a little bit caught off guard. After missing time from work due to my medical issue and with my wedding rapidly approaching I couldn\u2019t really afford to pay them their share. Also I wasn\u2019t going to reach out to everyone who did come and ask for more money now to pay back these girls who cancelled their flights very quickly upon hearing about my medical issue.\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to use people for money either. I paid one tenth of the Airbnb cost and from what I know a lot of brides and grooms to be don\u2019t pay a dime on their trips. I know my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t his brothers and friends booked everything without his knowledge. I didn\u2019t want to be like that as I already felt guilty with everyone spending so much money to celebrate me. \n\nI understand why they feel they are owed the money but I don\u2019t think I am going to pay them back.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll probably just tell them not to worry about a wedding gift since that seems like the general advice.", "created_utc": 1677613659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ehxph/aita_for_not_giving_money_back_to_my_friends_for/", "score": 986, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The general advice is that you pay them back.", "YTA. You effectively told them it wasn't happening, that you were trying to get money back, etc. They did not cancel on their own accord.

Repay them the money you owe them and apologize", "YTA. Regardless of your emotional / mental state, your wall of text implied the trip was off. It's completely reasonable they cancelled their flights, and for them to expect money back for a trip they did not attend due to your messaging. Whether brides typically pay for trips is immaterial, you took their money, then implied the trip was off, so they are entitled to their money back.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they backed out of the wedding, OP, because you are stealing from them if you refuse to repay them for your mistake.", "They don't \"feel\" they are owed the money they ARE owed the money.\n\nYTA", "Sorry but YTA.

It\u2019s an unfortunate situation, but by stating that you \u201cmost likely would not be able to go on the trip,\u201d it was implied that the wise move would be to refund the plane tickets, especially if you\u2019re unaware of the financial situation of the two individuals who had to cancel.\n\nYou should have been prepared to pay them back their share.

You heavily implied that the trip wouldn\u2019t be happening, so your friends wisely went ahead and cancelled their flights to rearrange their schedules and give themselves the best chances of getting their money back.\n\nThey didn\u2019t go on the trip because of *you*. They essentially gave you money for nothing, and then didn\u2019t even get to experience what they paid for. That money doesn\u2019t belong to you, and because of how this played out you need to find a way to pay them back.

You jumped the gun and the repercussions are you fault. Accept responsibility and find the money to refund them immediately. Or risk bad blood over it ....", "YTA. You paid 1/10th because there was going to be 10 of you. 8 went. The girls that canceled should absolutely get their money back. You\u2019re also right, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to ask the other girls for more money since the other two canceled. That\u2019s why you or your sister who planned it need to eat the cost.

They spent money on a trip FOR YOU that YOU implied cancellation of. This was your screw up.", "YTA, you told them you probably wouldn't be able to go on the trip. Sure that doesn't mean the trip is cancelled, but it was your bachelorette party, why would any go on a trip for a bachelorette party when the bachelorette isn't present?", "YTA \n\n... suggesting they don't give you a wedding gift as a \"see, we're even now.\" is even more absurd. \n\nGive them their money back and be thankful if they still trust you as a person after this.

Seems like you encouraged an extravagant bachelorette weekend, then told them it was most likely cancelled, then they did the responsible thing and cancelled their flights ASAP because airlines are the worst with cancelled flights. They did everything right here as far as I can tell. If you plan your whole bachelorette you are responsible. ALSO, you owe them atleast 50% of the Air BnB because that's what you told them you'd be able to get back", "YTA. You miscommunicated something, and they acted on it. This is your mistake. \n\nWhatever you do, do NOT ask the other 8 girls to make up the cost. That would be the biggest AH move of all, because this has nothing to do with them. Shocked people are even suggesting it.", "YTA. Your unclear miscommunication is what caused your friends to initially cancel ( with good reason ). It was your responsibility to communicate your situation prior to making a final decision and telling everyone your intention of canceling.", "YTA and if they take you to court they will get their money plus some extra.", "Why would other people need to make up the difference?

They canceled because like you said you overreacted about your medical issues and stress about the wedding and didn\u2019t take things calmly. It was easy for your friends to think that trip was cancel. You need to pay back because wedding gifts are things people buy for you out of the kindnesses of their own heart.

I understand that you panicked a little bit with your first message, but you still sent it, so this is ultimately on you. \n\nNot only were you confusing and indirect about whether or not the trip was going ahead, the plan you proposed for trying to get their airfare refunded was straight up ludicrous. In no universe can you just call up an airline and ask them to give your friend a refund without you knowing their personal information, the fare class of their ticket, etc. It makes no sense for you to do that. The *only* logical next step is for the person who booked the ticket to handle their own refund/cancellation. It was reasonable for your friends to ignore your suggestion and cancel their own flights based on your message. \n\nYou should have just waited three days and not sent any message at all. Or you could have said \u201chey everyone, there\u2019s a chance I might not be able to come, don\u2019t make any new bookings or reservations or anything for a few days and as soon as I know more I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Your mistake was promising everyone you were going to try to get their money back and so you should follow through on that promise, especially because you did not anticipate this problem until after the trip was completed and you apparently did not discuss your missing two friends at all with the other 8 while you were on the trip.", "YTA. \n\nI have no idea when these bachelorette parties became popular to ask people who are apart of YOUR wedding to pay anything. \n\nRegardless you made the mistake of jumping the gun. These girls deserve their money back.", "YTA. You were the whole reason they were going on this trip in the first place, and you were the sole reason why they canceled their tickets and thought the trip was cancelled and didn\u2019t end up going on the trip in the end. It began and ended with you. You owe them the money. If you don\u2019t pay them back I foresee the following happening: (1) they will drop out of the wedding, (2) they will stop being your friend, (3) they could, at least I would if I were them, take you to civil court to get their money back.", "Yta. Wuit scamming and pay them back.", "NAH, but since you did mishandle it, their request is reasonable. Ultimately they paid, but didn't get to participate due to your messaging.", "NAH.\n\nI think the girls were well within their rights to cancel, given the wall of text you described. I can understand medical anxiety on your part, but they had to go off of the best info they had at the time.\n\nYou\u2019re describing a financial squeeze on yourself; I\u2019d wonder if they\u2019re not dealing with something themselves, if they were so quick to cancel/are asking for their money back. I know I\u2019ve been reluctant/declined to go on expensive bachelorette trips, where the bride and planners didn\u2019t register how burdensome the cost was/thought the occasion justified it. The truth is, while your bachelorette party is a big thing for you, for almost everyone else, it\u2019s just a party, and an expensive one.\n\nThat said, if the girls did cancel, it\u2019s understandable that they might\u2019ve assumed they\u2019d get their share back. If this were before the fact, I\u2019d suggest you find someone else to fill their slots. As it\u2019s after, I think you have a few options.\n\n(1) It might be a decent idea to text the group and ask if they\u2019d be willing to spread the costs of the girls\u2019 money\u2014you don\u2019t necessarily need to bear it all yourself. \n\n(2) You could also talk to the girls about your own situation, and see if they\u2019d be willing to accept you partially refunding the money. \n\nFriendships always get tricky where there\u2019s money involved, and I don\u2019t envy your position. I think your best bet is honest communication.\n\nEdit: After rereading, I realized I missed the bit where she said she wasn\u2019t going to give the money back outright. Revising to asshole status.", "Group trips are hard. Group trips tied to weddings are even more difficult to pull off. \n\nI vote NAH . \n\nI would suggest letting those two friends know you would like to make it fair.

All in all ten girls were coming. It required a flight and obviously lodging as well. I decided to find the Airbnb myself and put it on my credit card and have everyone pay me for their share. \n\nAbout two weeks before the trip I had a medical issue that would require surgery. At this point I was very panicked and anxiety ridden. I was freaking out that I wouldn\u2019t be okay for my wedding and concerned about my bachelorette as well. A day or two before my surgery I sent a message to the girls that I would most likely not be able to go on the trip. I told them that I would get 50% of the Airbnb back and that I would call the airlines to explain the situation and try to get them their money back. I also sent a message stating that I would know if I could go for sure or not the day after my surgery.\n\nMy surgery went well and the issue was less severe than I originally thought. I was very excited that everything was working out and the day after my surgery  I texted that the trip was still on. Two of my friends informed me that they had already cancelled their flights.\n\nI felt really upset at first because they were good friends and I felt guilty because my text did imply that the trip wouldn\u2019t be happening. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t just wait until after my surgery to say anything but I was in a bad state of mind and overreacting to just about everything so I send the wall of text about cancelling. As I stated before however I did say that I would know for sure after my surgery whether we could go or not.\n\nThey didn\u2019t end up coming on the trip but I had a great time with the eight other girls. When I got back home I got a text from the two of them asking for their share of the Airbnb back. I was honestly a little bit caught off guard. After missing time from work due to my medical issue and with my wedding rapidly approaching I couldn\u2019t really afford to pay them their share. Also I wasn\u2019t going to reach out to everyone who did come and ask for more money now to pay back these girls who cancelled their flights very quickly upon hearing about my medical issue.\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to use people for money either. I paid one tenth of the Airbnb cost and from what I know a lot of brides and grooms to be don\u2019t pay a dime on their trips. I know my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t his brothers and friends booked everything without his knowledge. I didn\u2019t want to be like that as I already felt guilty with everyone spending so much money to celebrate me. \n\nI understand why they feel they are owed the money but I don\u2019t think I am going to pay them back.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Were they confused and canceled their flights, then looked to rebook and couldn\u2019t at a similar rate?\n\nRereading your post, it sounds like your friends canceled their flights expecting the trip to be canceled (based on your text saying as much). At a minimum, I think it\u2019d be fair to send them each 50% of what they paid for the AirBnB, since that\u2019s what you said everyone could expect back. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not think you can tell them to just skip the wedding gift and call it even. It\u2019s rude, and how do you even know how much they would give? For a lot of bachelorettes I\u2019ve been on, my share of the Airbnb cost much more than the gift for the wedding.", "Right?

YTA. \nGlad your surgery went well though.", "Let\u2019s say that each person was $200 for the nights, ask the other 8 people to pitch in $50 more dollars is way better than just keeping the $400 from the 2 girls that canceled.

Your friends didn\u2019t attend the trip. Give them their money back. You panicked. Don\u2019t you think they were stressed about possibly not getting refunded last minute?!

Obviously, with a limited amount of time to cancel a trip like that, people aren't just going to wait to find out after your surgery whether or not the trip is still on.

To these people, the bride-to-be is having intense medical issues, and she \"will try to get the money back\" for the Air BnB.

If you really expected them to wait and see, you wouldn't have texted them before the surgery. \n\nYour expectations don't match your actions. You told them you would get 50% back on the Airbnb and you would call the airlines. These are not \"if\" statements. *If* I need to cancel, I can get 50% back. \n\nThis was financial to you. If you did actually need to cancel, you would be able to tell them you told them you'd contact the airlines but they chose to wait. But since you didn't cancel, you \"implied\" and they should have waited. Thus minimizing any financial responsibility on your part whichever way it turned out.\n\nBut it doesn't eliminate your financial obligation to refund the Airbnb cost. If they had made their own reservations, they could cancel on their own. You also told them you would get 50% back.\n\nWhich brings us to the cost of friendship. Your friends were willing to spend a significant amount of money on airfare and lodging to celebrate you. They probably took a loss on the tickets when they canceled. \n\nYou, OTOH, expected them to wait even if they took a bigger loss on the airfare, still pay for a portion of the lodging, and bring a gift equal to the cost of the refund they're requesting (so you can call it even).\n\nTakeaway: It costs money to be your friend, and if forced to choose, you would take money over friendship.\n\nSometimes finding out who people really are is worth the price.", "Yep keep justifying the unjustifiable.
