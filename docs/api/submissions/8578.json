One member, \"Billy\" (M, 44) kept following me around, asking about kiddie shows we both liked, even when I asked him to stop or when he had promised not to. Later the company did a cabaret show where I had to perform a number with Billy (it's on Youtube) and after our performance he announced to the crowd that we had become best friends, and I was mortified, having no choice but to go along, even when he went into our history and said things like \"I don't wish to hurt him, well not intentionally.\" The crowd laughed but I was not amused. After the show, when I expressed disapproval towards my parents, they said his actions were \"sweet\" and \"a friendly gesture that wasn't appreciated.\" They said I had handled it well at the time and now I wasn't. When I pointed out that he hugged me without asking, my mother, who is of an earlier mindset and doesn't have a problem with nonconsensual touch, said \"it's not like he grabbed your boobs.\" They insisted Billy's motives were pure, even though there have been times when I have been accused of harassment and told \"intention versus impact.\"\n\nLater Billy wanted to go to a party to which I had invited some friends. He kept asking repeatedly, even though I said no because of his history of not respecting my wishes. Since my father was nearby, Billy told my father to force me to invite him. Every time since when I encountered Billy he kept asking me to hang out and refused to take no for an answer, or else getting mopey like a toddler who's been denied extra dessert. When I brought this up with the head of the company, \"Andi\" (F, age unknown), she basically excused him, claiming that his behavior wasn't harassment since it wasn't based in sexual desire, adding that we both have social deficits and it was a shame we weren't getting along since we had so many common interests. Some in my family have posited that Billy is more easily excused since he's considered \"lower functioning\" (pardon the term), so less is expected of him. Another theory is that his family is rather well-off, as they're able to buy him his own apartment, and the company gives favors to its contributors.\n\nAITA for telling Billy to go away?", "created_utc": 1674954094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nuulp/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_a_colleague_who/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not a bad person for having boundaries and wanting nothing to do with him so NTA. \n\nI agree with one of the fellow commenters here that you have every right to say \"no\" and do continue establishing boundaries. Secondly, there is nothing wrong with you having the right to choose who you want to be friends with. No one has the right to force you to be friends with him \n\nIf this keeps bothering you, I suggest you try talking to a trusted person such as a doctor or someone about this.
