She always vents about her challenging students, which can sometimes border on dangerous behavior. It\u2019s become a nightly ritual that\u2019s driving a wedge between us. I dread it. Part of me just wants to say, \u201cI told you so,\u201d but I\u2019ve held my tongue. Since she became a teacher we rarely have sex or become romantic.

That way lies misery for both of you, which is unfair to you because never ending misery in a situation where alternative choices can be made isn't what you signed up to.\n\nShe should embrace the challenges of the job and seek little victories that she can be enthused about and talk about. In this scenario, the odd complaint now & again wouldn't be so bad.

Sounds like the main issue here is that you resent her for doing something you didn't want her to do (and the not-so-subtle hint that you resent paying for it), and you have no compassion for her difficult situation. I will also say that teaching can take years of adjusting to figure out the right policies and methods. Just because she hates it now, doesn't mean she will in 5 more years. With your help and support, she might find solutions and mitigate her stress enough to figure it out, but this way, you've just isolated her in her stress.

Teachers often face really difficult situations such as students being neglected or abused at home and they sometimes have little power to do anything about it. I agree with others about your wife getting counseling but sometimes she might just need to get some stuff off of her chest.

From now on, if you vent about them to me, I will step away until you are able to engage in our relationship around other things or until something else changes.\" And then if she starts venting at the end of the day, you simply get up and go to a different room.

I often wish that when I came home after a really awful day at work, that I had a flatmate or a partner to vent to.

Maybe being a Saint (maybe not..) but that is NOT the long term solution here. It's so so so hard for teachers to clock out for the day/evening. It's a super important skill to learn.  My wife LOVES her students to the point of not taking care of her own needs. \n\n\nI wish you the best OP AND OP'S wife. I feel like downvotes are coming, and usually that means I just wouldn't post... but I've been exactly where you are and it took a LOT of growth on both of our parts->its just too important for me to not share some support. Education, and educators are in a scary place right now. They're expected to be mental health professionals. Parents. Advocates. Disciplinarys. Coaches. Therpists. AND teachers...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd be open im sure my wife and yours could exchange emails or something.  Give em some pen pals.", "I might be in the minority but I vote NTA. \nI used to work for a horrible boss. I was \u201claid off\u201d and then found out I was pregnant so I haven\u2019t worked since. Shortly after I was let go, my manager called me and told me a super crazy story about what the boss asked her to do, ( nothing illegal just like wtf stuff) and she went home and tried to complain to her husband about the boss and her husband said that she comes home every night and complains so either she\u2019s quits the job and he 100% supports her quitting and finding a new job or that she doesn\u2019t bring it up again bc he\u2019s tired of hearing it. \nAll the people who worked for this boss would go home and complain to their partners bc he was the worst. The only reason we stayed was bc the other boss was amazing! \nBut after her husband said that, she said it was like a light went off and she typed her two week\u2019s notice that night and gave it the next day. \nIt\u2019s ok to admit it\u2019s not working at your job if it\u2019s not working, it\u2019s not a failure or anything. It\u2019s accepting that life is too dang short to be miserable", "NTA", "My wife is also a teacher and I work nights.\nSo out rule is NOT when I wake up (right when she gets home) and NOT before I try to sleep in the morning (it WILL keep my head turning)", "So many people believe venting is healthy. And it is/can be.\n\nBut there IS a line...", "So would your reading comprehension skills, the man has been using his words for year. Him having a weak moment and snapping at her is not good, but it's understandable.", "Does she express wanting a change or does it seem like she\u2019s just looking to vent? Maybe suggest seeking out a therapist to help her with the stress and/or joining groups on social media where she can get these things out and ask for advice. Needing to vent is okay, but when it\u2019s constant and negatively affecting home life in a major way something needs to change. Your frustration is understandable.\n\nMaybe when you two discuss your days together you can give each other an opportunity to vent, but for each venting session, you each bring up a nice thing from the day afterwards. That way the hard parts aren\u2019t the sole focus. Negativity is a hard mindset to get out of, especially when the stress causing it is so consistent. Ending on a bright spot can sometimes help remember that the hard parts of the day don\u2019t erase the good, especially when the hard parts are so overwhelming.\n\nShe should be able to vent, but it seems like the amount she does it is overwhelming. I\u2019ve had friends who only seem to talk to me when they want a free therapist, who are so consumed by their personal problems that it\u2019s overwhelming. It seems like it\u2019s affecting you in that kind of way and clearly hurting your relationship. An actual therapist would be really good for her if you two can afford it. She needs to be able to get it out, but she also needs to respect how it is affecting you and the relationship you two share.", "It's AITA, OP has a better chance of jumping from the top of Empire State building straight into a lion's cage and still making it out alive than he has of not being called an asshole for offending his wife.", "> She is not asking for a solution to her problems\n\nNah she just decided to do something that would create problems and then make all those problems his problems.", "Paras are underpaid and undervalued. \n\nI think the REALITY of what goes on it school isn't something people really understand. They THINK they do become hey, they were in school...", "It does. And it can definitely breed a sort of dynamic where they expect to come to you with shit becauaw they feel you're safe to vent to.\n\nBut there are ways to express a healthy boundary without telling someone to stfu and no one cares too.\n\n\"You know. I love you but I don't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with this right now\"\n\nOr \n\n\"You know. I'm really not qualified to speak on that. Have you talked to your colleagues/therapist/etc?\"", "Have you met stepmothers? They're all bad as well no questions asked\ud83d\ude02", "Spouses are not therapists. I'm not sure what image you have of what a spouse's duties should be but constant complaints and using someone as a sounding board isn't exactly very healthy for the spouse. Also the spouse is human and allowed to feel emotions too and a daily dose of complaints at a time table just so SHE can unload kinda means she's dumping it all on him. How many times will the man keep listening without saying anything when as he says there are situations that are bordering dangerous."]}
