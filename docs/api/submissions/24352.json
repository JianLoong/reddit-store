She originally had ambitions of being successful business or private sector. But after we tied the knot, she had a change of heart and decided she wanted to teach. We live in a state notorious for its underfunded schools, so I expressed my concerns, thinking she\u2019d struggle and be unhappy. Even with my reservations and having to pay for her degree, she became a teacher and has been at it for 4 years now.\n\nThe problem: She\u2019s miserable and so am I. She always vents about her challenging students, which can sometimes border on dangerous behavior. It\u2019s become a nightly ritual that\u2019s driving a wedge between us. I dread it. Part of me just wants to say, \u201cI told you so,\u201d but I\u2019ve held my tongue. Since she became a teacher we rarely have sex or become romantic. However, on Monday night, after hearing the same ole complaints for the thousandth time, I snapped and told her to shut up about it. It sparked an argument and then we went to bed. Since she\u2019s been silent ever since and it\u2019s becoming very petty and i know it can also explode.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691692224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nkc8v/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_shut_up_about_her/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to learn to TALK with your partner instead of waiting... and waiting... and then snapping and being an unsupportive asshole.\n\nAlso... \"Shut up about it\" ? Yikes. Maybe try to be supportive instead of agressive ?! Something like \"I feel like your job is not making you very happy right now, is there something that could make it better?\"", "YTA. It seems like since she didnt do what you wanted you just checked out. You could be showing some support but you're too busy thinking on how you was right. You also claim she is miserable, but all I read in your post are assumptions. You can dislike some aspects of your job but it doesnt mean you hate it all.\n\nPS: Try asking her if she is happy with her job and if she thought about other options instead. Don't assume all your relationship problems are related to her career either.", "YTA.  All you had to say is something like \"you seem really unhappy with your job and I'm not sure that I know how to support you in this. Maybe we could get you a therapist that you could work through these feelings with - someone who has the training to help you work through everything you're going through. I want you to be happy but I don't think that I have the ability to help with this.\"", "NTA\n\nIt's difficult and extremely frustrating listening to the same complaints over and over again where you don't have the power to change things and your wife isn't doing anything to change things. That way lies misery for both of you, which is unfair to you because never ending misery in a situation where alternative choices can be made isn't what you signed up to.\n\nShe should embrace the challenges of the job and seek little victories that she can be enthused about and talk about. In this scenario, the odd complaint now & again wouldn't be so bad. Or if this can't or won't happen, then she should either keep her complaints to herself (but that's no good for the two of you as a couple) or she should quit and find another job that wouldn't result in her making complaints all the time.", "I feel like you should elaborate on your post to clarify certain points that make you out to be the \u2018asshole\u2019 here, especially with the overwhelming amount of comments that support that. However, I read one comment and you clarified a specific point - how often you talk to your wife in a calm manner about your discomfort when listening to her venting - and now the situation isn\u2019t so clear cut. Do you support her and her profession? I am guessing you do as you funded her degree. Do you try to comfort her? Have you communicated your desire to rekindle the intimacy in your relationship?\n\nI can\u2019t honestly say you are the asshole. I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. Although, I believe you shouldn\u2019t have bottled everything up and then snapped.", "NTA, you need marriage counseling though. Her venting daily is not healthy for either of you, and you both need to learn to communicate in healthier ways.", "ESH and I think it's imperative that you sign up for marriage counselling, or divorce is just around the corner. \n\nYou've been handling this right up until the moment you snapped and told her to shut up. That's what made you an AH. You could've said that you don't want to listen to her complain about same issues over and over in a polite way but you didn't", "NTA\n\nIt is really really hard to hear the same complaints day after day and never seeing movement to change anything. No change on her perspective and no change in her aspirations.", "Sounds like she did exactly what you wanted...she shut up about it. You didn't mention what the pettiness was, and that's not cool, but when I'm told to shut up, by god, I shut up. ETA: And what did you expect her to feel about being told to shut up? Did you expect her to thank you for discipling her real good?\n\nYou warned her, she went after it anyway, and now she's miserable. Sounds like the main issue here is that you resent her for doing something you didn't want her to do (and the not-so-subtle hint that you resent paying for it), and you have no compassion for her difficult situation. I will also say that teaching can take years of adjusting to figure out the right policies and methods. Just because she hates it now, doesn't mean she will in 5 more years. With your help and support, she might find solutions and mitigate her stress enough to figure it out, but this way, you've just isolated her in her stress. I know hearing the same droning on day after day is exhausting. I get that, but ask yourself if you were in the same position, would you want her to be there for you?\n\nYTA", "INFO: had you communicated to her that you found the topic draining and would prefer to discuss something else in previous conversations, or established any sort of boundary around work talk?", "NTA\n\nYour wife either needs to start some sort of decompression routine before she gets home.  OR she needs to change careers.\n\nI feel for her.  I am fully aware that I would never make it as a teacher.  \n\nBUT, she can make changes so that you both have a peaceful home and supportive marriage.  \n\nMaybe she needs to go to the gym and rage lift.  Maybe organize a group of friends/colleagues to go on a reset walk after school is out.  Maybe get into Yoga a few days a week.  Whatever will get her to decompress and reset so she doesn't drag her career baggage into your relationship.\n\nIt is one thing to say \"Today was rough, and give some tidbits and then move on.\" But if it goes beyond that, then she needs to figure out what to do to get away from the obsessive rantings.\n\nWhat can you do?  Don't hold it against her that she chose to pursue teaching.  It sounds like she has a big heart and it is getting trampled on daily.  But do sit her down at a time you are both calm and say \"Hey, this is not working.  You are miserable.  And it seems to weigh to heavily on you that it is also affecting our marriage and our homelife.   I WANT you to be happy and I want us to have a happy home and life.  So, we and especially you need to figure out how to get back to that.\"", "My mom was a middle school teacher and she came home every night and complained about her job. I was only 12 or 13 when this started. It was really uncomfortable for me but I later realized that she did it because she just needed to vent to someone. Teachers often face really difficult situations such as students being neglected or abused at home and they sometimes have little power to do anything about it. I agree with others about your wife getting counseling but sometimes she might just need to get some stuff off of her chest. Maybe set aside a time each day to talk, say 30 minutes, but once that time is over you get on with the rest of the evening? In any case she needs your support.", "NTA.  Listening to the same complaints over and over, and knowing that the person is not going to do anything to change it gets extremely old.  Yes, you shouldn't have snapped, but as your comments below state, you've tried talking to her about this before.  She won't change until she's ready unfortunately, so you may be in for a good long wait.  I think perhaps (even though I understand where you're coming from) an apology and conversation is in order.", "Nta. My sister has been teaching middle school for 10 years and I cannot stand to her her complain about it. If they are that unhappy they need to find a new job or pay someone to listen to them vent. I\u2019m tired of hearing it.", "NTA for feeling the way you do but YTA for letting yourself blow up. If it gets on your nerves, diffuse or dip. Couples therapy to learn how to communicate and to read when to back off with one another.", "NTA \n\nwhen people talk about the same thing over and over again, its annoying, period, no matter how big of a part of their lives it is or how forgivable it is that they do that. I'm guessing most of the comments voting haven't had to deal with that. You probably could have been nicer but telling her to stop was probably the best thing you could do, often times letting someone know there is a problem is the first step, like that episode of gumball where darwin learned to be assertive (probably not a relatable simile but what ever). If you just let annoying stuff slide, it will keep happening, I think what you did was fine.", "Yta because you let your resentment build up until you exploded and expressed yourself in a really mean and rude way. You could have brought this up to her way earlier in a kinder way. I don't think you are bad because you are tired of listening to the same thing over and over again. I would be tired too. You are bad because of the way you went about it.", "NTA.   My wife is a special ed teacher and there is nothing worse than hearing about how awful her students are every day of the week.  I truly feel bad for her but I really don\u2019t care to hear about the same complaints every day. This kid screamed in my ear all day, this other kid pooped his pants twice. I don\u2019t care", "\"love of my life, would you please shut the fuck up? You're so annoying!!!\"\n\nYeah it doesn't seem very pleasant. You could have been much less buthole about it. YTA", "YTA for the wording of 'shut up' but NTA for being frustrated. \n\nI think the way to go about this would be to simply say: \"I'm not able to be the supportive listener you want when you vent about your job. I understand you've chosen a very challenging job and you may need somebody to listen to you, but I cannot play this role anymore in hearing about your students. From now on, if you vent about them to me, I will step away until you are able to engage in our relationship around other things or until something else changes.\" And then if she starts venting at the end of the day, you simply get up and go to a different room. Walk away every time, and she will get the hint.", "YTA - Just listen and say, we been talking about this everyday, maybe lets talk about something different, something positive. Communication is key. Goodness.", "YTA. Teaching as a new teacher is frustrating and exhausting and draining and can be all-consuming until you\u2019ve been doing it for a few years. As a 4th year teacher who started during the remote year, it has not been easy. But I will say this - if your wife has stuck with it for this long, even though it\u2019s been rough, she loves that job and the more you put it down, the more likely it will be she ends up loving that job more than she loves you. \n\nTake it from someone who has experience. The more my ex put down my job, the worse our relationship got, and notice that he\u2019s an ex, not a current partner.", "ESH\n\nOf course you shouldn't snap at her and tell her to shut up. \n\nOf course she shouldn't repeat the same whine ad nauseum.\n\nHave a discussion about it and potentially go to counselling. Something has to change.", "YTA. I completely understand about not getting laid in a relationship and being frustrated though. But what you did was not the way to go. Just showcase how inhappy she is and suggest she get a new job. Ask her what teaching is really providing her with.\n\nEdit:  when you apologize DO NOT say \"so i made a reddit post\" lmfao", "You told her to shut up about it and she shut up about it.  Now you are annoyed and calling her petty.\n\nYep - you sound like YTA\n\nHave you apologized for telling her to shut up yet?\n\nI guess she should have seen that once in a century or two pandemic that has made being a teacher unbearable the last almost entire time she\u2019s been teaching too, huh?", "EHS. Talking to your partner about shit is good, but if your constantly dumping on your partner all your shit, it's not going to be healthy, especially if it's affecting other parts of your life. You also shouldn't have snapped like that. There's a healthier and more respectful way to create space and end the convo when you need to. Sounds like therapy may be wise.", "ESH", "YTA instead of supporting or helping your partner you yell at them because it bums you out.", "YTA. Telling your wife to shut up is never a good look", "YTA for the way you went about it, but having a serious conversation about the whole situation is necessary for you too. \n\nThis is a really hard one for me to consider. I\u2019m a middle school teacher by profession, and I taught a really really low ability year class of 3rd graders last year. I often wish that when I came home after a really awful day at work, that I had a flatmate or a partner to vent to. The job of a teacher has been absolutely taking a rollercoaster ride in the last years with COVID increasing Social anxiety numbers, numbers of special needs kids going up, kids\u2019 behaviour just getting a whole lot worse (I cannot even phathom the school shootings situation in the US as a Finnish person), and teachers\u2019 workload multiplying in the last few years. So I absolutely understand her needing to vent and being so frustrated that things don\u2019t change. \n\nBut I would much more recommend talking to her about how she could maybe ask you first if venting is alright at that time, and maybe even talk to her about if the job is healthy to her (not very directly and after talking about the venting first) and talking about how you see that her stress and such is affecting the relationship.
