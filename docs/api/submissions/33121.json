He says still best not to tell my friends so I still can\u2019t tell her but he\u2019s told 5+ people in his circle. \n\nAm I being unreasonable here? He\u2019s told people when I asked him not to.

He hasn't experienced miscarriage, so he doesn't know the heartache it leaves. And he's excited. But that's not an excuse. He should have listened to you.

It\u2019s bad enough he told the guys when you specifically asked him not to. And now he STILL won\u2019t \u201dlet you\u201d tell your best friend?! That\u2019s all kinds of fucked up.

He is not your boss, it's just an advice that he hasn't even taken himself. \n\nBut maybe don't take it to serious. He was probably a bit tipsy, and is very happy about the pregnancy... And he hasn't had you Experience.\n\nSo do whatever is good for you and what makes you happy atm. I had one miscarriage, and I was devastated. And not a year later I gave birth to a healthy boy.

Let me get this straight, he is requesting you not to tell people, something to do with your body, your health, physically and mentally.. but he can go and tell his friends\u2026but it is ok they don\u2019t know you that well.

He\u2019s no right to tell you that you can\u2019t share your medical information with people you\u2019re close to. Especially since he\u2019s told a bunch of people - most of whom it sounds like you don\u2019t really know/aren\u2019t close to. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander after all. If he\u2019s unhappy about it well then that\u2019s just tough! You are the one most in need of support - even if things all go well you may be dealing with sickness and fatigue etc which you may want to vent about/need comfort or cheering up if you\u2019re feeling really rough etc. Please don\u2019t deprive yourself of this simply to keep him happy, particularly as he\u2019s show he doesn\u2019t give a damn about being considerate about your feelings in this matter! He\u2019s a hypocrite and as the poster above said he\u2019s being controlling. I\u2019m also angry on your behalf because he\u2019s being ridiculous breaking your agreement but telling you not to. Yes it\u2019s his baby but right now it\u2019s all about you, and you need to prioritise yourself and your physical and emotional wellbeing.

OP told her sister so that god forbid anything happened, she'd have someone to help support her. It was OPs suggestion for him to tell his best friend. But she'd prefer a group of people she barely knows, not know her medical information. Especially considering there is a history of loss. OP wanted to tell her friends, but partner said no. And then turned around  and did exactly what he said not to do. OP is definitely NTA and should be able to tell her medical information to whoever she wants and be allowed to be pissed off it was shared without her consent.", "He might have just been bursting to tell someone though. He shouldn\u2019t have done it but it might not have been done with bad intentions", "That'S buillshit: SHE told first, so he is fine to tell, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer sister is HER support network, his friends are his.", "Hence \u201dsure\u201d at the beginning of my comment."]}
