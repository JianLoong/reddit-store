So, he bought a house in Connecticut about an hour from where we all grew up. He used his VA loan to do so, and his name was listed on the mortgage because she had no job.\n\nThey got divorced, my brother moved out, and their divorce decree specified that she had two years to refinance it into her own name. If she did not, my brother could sell it or move back in, but she no longer would have a right to it. \n\nShe moved in with a new BF and my BF (M26) and I were asked by her to move in while we waited for our house to close. \n\nThe house was pretty much disgusting when we moved in as it had been vacant for months. We cleaned it and lived there for six months with almost no incident before she eventually asked us to start paying rent(the exact amount of the mortgage payment), and we agreed without an issue.. There were a few things that pissed is off but we endured and ended up paying my brother, the mortgage directly\u2026\n\n3 years later, after we had invested almost $30,000, she then claimed she was coerced into signing the divorce decree and a judge\u2019s ordered that she would be given five months to get the house into her name, and that my brother was not to get in the way. It also stated that there was nothing that could be done to help me or my BF because we were not parties to the case. We refused to leave, obviously, because I had nowhere to go, and I was still paying the mortgage every month. \n\nWe sought legal advice, and were advised to sue her so that either she could relinquish the house to my brother so that we could attempt to purchase it, or if she did purchase the house, she would have to pay us out for the money that we spent to improve it. Unfortunately, because the lawsuit is about the property, the property owner, my brother, had to be included in the suit.\n\nMy brother isn\u2019t mad at me. In fact, I am very close with him, his fianc\u00e9 and all of their kids. He understands that we are in a hard place, because we invested a lot of money into this property, and it would all go to nothing if she actually purchased it. Does this make us assholes?\n\nTL,DR: My BF (M26) and I (F26) lived in my brother\u2019s (M36) vacant marital home for two years after his divorce and took care of my SIL\u2019s (F33) farm animals, paid the mortgage and renovated the house from to top to bottom, but the court is forcing my brother to sell the house to my ex-SIL for what is left on the mortgage. This would leave us homeless, and around $30,000 in the lurch. Are my BF and I the assholes for suing my brother and his ex-wife for money for repairs to their marital home?", "created_utc": 1699755363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ta9e7/aita_for_suing_my_brother_and_exsil_for_30000/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have 5 months, can\u2019t you find another place to rent?

If she had done what she was supposed to, she wouldn't be in this mess. Brother had to be named for legal reasons, not personal ones.", "So uh here's the thing.  Your brother as the legal owner of the property is the one who needs to be fighting this. It's been like twice as long as the given amount of time she had.  Regardless of whether or not she was coerced into agreeing is irrelevant.  She agreed on paper. Since there's nothing but her word against your brother's on the matter. There's no way that she could prove whether she was coerced.  There's no way in hell that a judge would make that kind of ruling. For it to even come before a judge she'd have to be sueing your brother and he'd have to be present to make his case and that'd take months if not longer so unless that all happened then look into what judge made this ruling because it's greasy af.  In all honesty with only the information you have given us here I wouldn't be surprised if it never actually went before a judge and she's just lying about it.  Makes more sense than the dumpster fire that is this situation.  \n\n\nQuestions: I know you said you'd been making the mortgage payments but it was through your brother right? With the given details I can only assume that since she was given temporary ownership dependent upon her refinancing or selling the house that she'd be responsible for making those payments not him. Do you now or have you ever had a lease agreement for the house? It sounds to me like she abandoned the house.  She wasn't maintaining the property \n\n>The house was pretty much disgusting when we moved in as it had been vacant for months.\n\nShe wasn't making the mortgage payment \n\n>There were a few things that pissed is off but we endured and ended up paying my brother, the mortgage directly\u2026\n\nAnd allowed this situation to stand for a significant amount of time \n\n>3 years later\n\nSo yeah she abandoned it. You've got rights as tenants she can't legally just tell you to leave even if she wants to. \n\n This is a fucked up but funny in retrospect situation that's kind of similar. My sister and her family rented a house once upon a time and after like 3 years of living in the place everyone found out that the landlord of the place didn't actually have any kind of ownership of the place.  Was renting it out without the actual owners knowledge.  When it came to light and the owner was like wtf is happening here since it was through no fault of my sister's the owner had to honor the lease the other dude made with my sister despite the \"landlord \" not having any right to rent the place out. The main takeaway being they can't just throw you out on your ass regardless of what happens between xsil and your brother.  \n\nGet on your brother's ass about fighting the case", "NTA your brother understands and is on your side as well.", "INFO: why do you think you're out 30K? You were essentially renting this house from your SIL, right? 30K is more than reasonable for two years of rent, that's a little more than 1K a month (less rent than a typical 1BR apartment where I live). Or is the 30K the cost of the repairs/renovation you've put in, not including rent? If so then why do you think she is obligated to pay you back for the renovations? That was your choice. You didn't have to live there and she was not obligated to provide you with a cheap place to stay while you closed on your house. Do you have a signed contract stating she would repay you for the cost of the repairs? If not then you're probably out of luck.", "YTA\nThat 30k is owed by your brother because he offered a deal that was rendered void by the new court judgement. Anything you put into the house in that period of \"going into a contract\" would be owed by your brother by extending a contract that was legally voided by the ruling. He might have recourse to sue her if she fails to refinance, but the only suit that would be applicable to recoup that 30k is against your brother the individual.", "Yta $30k of rent over 3 years is reasonable. It doesn\u2019t matter that you were paying to the owner\u2019s mortgage (that\u2019s what all rent goes towards) or you paid for improvements that you had agreed upon with the owners.\n\nYea, you\u2019re out $30k.
