A relationship where one ignores the other's worries, and then the other respond by \"putting their foot down\" seems a bit unhealthy.\n\nRegardless, for what it's worth, your situation seems to be PRIMED for moving and I wonder if you simply don't want to move for other reasons?

No mortgage .., see what\u2019s up", "Rent free in Cali? Holy crap why would you want to stay in Michigan?

And the risk is extremely  low if all you stated is true.", "YTA. You\u2019re backing out based on irrational fear. You don\u2019t have job prospects in Michigan.

It makes ZERO sense.", "YTA for not considering the move. You\u2019re acting like a townie tbh. You do t have great job prophecy\u2019s in Michigan and should try to apply for things in CA. It\u2019s ok to have concerns, but you haven\u2019t articulated any other than the idea of moving gives you anxiety. What are you plans after your house sells?

The wife can theoretically keep doing her part-time remote work from CA.\n\nThe fact that they can live rent-free and he doesn\u2019t have a job now anyway makes this a pretty low-risk idea at the moment.

Just have a discussion with your wife about you having anxiety moving to a new place. Find strategies to help you work through it together. You\u2019re supposed to be a team.

I promise you that you will be able to make new friends, find community groups, etc\u2026 anywhere you go. I mean, you\u2019re not even leaving the country!\n\nNew starts can be great, too! You feel less defined by your past and able to be whoever you feel like being in the present! Try and think of the positives because you\u2019ve listed a lot already and perhaps you can find more! \n\nEither way, this is a decision that the two of you have to agree upon. Neither of you should just dictate where the other lives. But you need to find a way to be excited together for your next step. Talk to your wife and hopefully you can work this out! \nGood luck!", "I get it. 5 years ago, I moved from my home state to another state I had never even been to because of my husbands job. I tried backing out the whole last week before we left. Hell, I tried backing out as we were leaving the driveway! Was absolutely terrified! \n\nWe just bought a house last year, my husband has a better job and my kids have much better schools! In the end, everything worked out. Was it hard? Yeah. Were we barely making ends meet? Absolutely, but it didn\u2019t stay that way.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I figured I would regret moving here. Everything felt bleak. However, 5 1/2 years later? Best damn decision we ever made. \n\nSo, yeah, I get it but sometimes, you just gotta jump and trust the process.\n\nETA: good luck to y\u2019all!", "You're letting fear control you. Moving away from your comfort zone is scary but staying stagnant with no prospects is even worse.", "This shouldn\u2019t be downvoted. It\u2019s always scary to leave somewhere, it killed me the first time I moved.\n\nBut honestly, after reading your post there is zero reason to not go. You have to get over your fear for your future and for your wife. Take the brave step and move. Michigan isn\u2019t providing for you now and you have a chance at a future somewhere else. Go get it.

Good luck and make the move man!", "I have lived in Michigan and in California and let me tell you if housing costs in CA we\u2019re not an issue I would move there in a heartbeat.

I moved from Michigan to the PNW for awhile and finally back to the East Coast. The PNW is beautiful, but truly lacking seasons which I always missed, but to get anywhere it is a flight or a long drive, heck because of traffic even though it is only 168 miles to Portland it could take like 5 hours. I personally started to hate everything about not being able to go somewhere, driving, for a weekend. Being back on the East Coast, can travel to a different city/area rather easily and new experiences. \n\nI think you need to see if you would even like living there?! Most of California to me is soul crushing and boring (my opinion) but if you can spend time to see if you want to live there, maybe you will like it.", "It's really annoying when all an AITA OP's clarifying comments and even ones accepting their judgment are downvoted into oblivion.", "Lol, California is soul crushing and boring?  I wonder why our housing prices are so high or why we get more tourists than anywhere else in the US, or why when I tell Germans I'm from California they demand to know why I would have possibly left.", "Yeah. It annoys me to read comments on here as people seem to downvote OP no matter what. They also seem to comment leave the person or put yourself first every time. I get those things are right, but not every damn time", "I live in Carmel Highlands and it is not action packed but I am all about mild weather, nature hikes and the like.  It is always amusing to me when people say Cali sucks and I look out my window at my view and see national weather reports, hmm.

Just go talk to your wife", "YWBTA\n\nIt\u2019s natural to be nervous about a big move and second guess yourself. Considering leaving family and friends behind is a big deal. \n\nBUT, if this is your wife\u2019s dream, and you\u2019ve agreed and have been planning for months, it\u2019s going to be a huge disappointment for your wife if you change your mind now. \n\nWhere in CA matters a lot, as the regional differences are vast. If you\u2019re near the ocean, it\u2019s pretty sweet and worth checking out. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you can always move back.", "YWBTA.

She currently has a part time job teaching which is presumably not very well paid and you have no job, and not good prospects either.\n\nCalifornia is a better jobs market and your cost of living will likely be lower due to the rent free condo to live in. Where exactly is the downside here? \n\nYou'll have a fat stack of cash, won't have to invest it in buying a house or wasting a bunch in expensive rent so if it didn't work out after 6 months, you can move elsewhere. Seems like a no brainer as it's your cheapest living option while you look for jobs anywhere really. You can stay free in Cali and apply for jobs anywhere.", "YTA but it definitely just sounds like you're nervous and not sure about moving in general.\n\nI get it - I lived in the Midwest my entire life until almost a decade ago, when I uprooted and moved to the west coast with no job prospects lined up. I had debt and no savings. It was a *risk* and I was terrified. My entire support system was based elsewhere.\n\nBut you know what? There's a lot of work out here, even now - it took me less than a month to get something way better than I could've hoped for back there. And you realize that you can build new support systems, and your old ones are only a call or visit away. I love living here, can't imagine going back. And if I hadn't taken that leap, I'd never have known.\n\nIt's gonna be okay. You've got a huge safety net and nothing to lose. But talk to your partner about your fears; tell her you aren't not moving but you need her to not shrug them off because they're seriously messing with you. She needs to understand she is gonna be your number one go to soon, and if she can't take your anxiety seriously then it's not gonna be any better in CA. But for real, guy, you've got it all worked out, this is a smart move.", "NTA.  California is literally one of the most expensive states and in a crisis in many ways.

Loved snow, winters, all of it. \n\nThen I moved to CA after school, and never wanted to go back. \n\nWhere in CA would you be? It\u2019s a big state. And MI is big; where would you be moving from?", "... and wait for it ... no snow to shovel off the driveway (in most places anyway).\n\nI would say unless you proudly wear your MAGA hat in your day-to-day attire, CA is a better location, all things considered.

In OP's case, that's a heavily subsidized line item.", "I moved to CA from the Chicago area in 1993, and I freaking love it here.  It's like life opened up for me here, when I was being crushed in the Midwest.\n\nCA is a huge state.  I'm at the beach in San Diego, and it's awesome.  I can understand other areas not being so great.  \n\nYou can't just say \"California\" like it's all the same.  It's huge."]}
