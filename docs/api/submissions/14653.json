It's so weird when people get weird over things like this. It's not a race.", "You are NTA. Your family sounds like the type of people to ask you to set yourself on fire to keep your sister warm. These \u201cBut faaaaaaamily\u201d types really tick me off.\n\nLet her be furious. If your family calls you to pester you about it, say \u201cOur decision is final\u201d and hang up the phone. If they confront you in person, say \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss this again\u201d and walk away. Lather, rinse and repeat until they get the message.", "Absolutely NTA.  Nobody gets dibs or gets to set rules on when you can get married.  That\u2019s just ridiculous.  I have zero idea why anyone would think otherwise.  And if she wants to elope why does anyone care?  If they don\u2019t get a say in her eloping or not why do they think they get a say in your wedding?   I\u2019d just not invite anyone who wasn\u2019t being supportive.  I don\u2019t care who they are.", "NTA. She's being ridiculous. If she really wants to throw her big wedding plans out the window for some made-up sibling competition, let her.", "NTA. Your life and timeline shouldn\u2019t be changed because she has some weird need to be married first. Making big life decisions as a competition is never a good thing. It sounds like if she wanted to be first bad enough she could have opted for a smaller wedding. Just ignore her and enjoy your day!", "Definitely NTA. You can choose to get married whenever you want. Other people shouldn't make this a competition of who gets married first, it's ridiculous. If your sister can't afford a wedding right now, that's on her. You shouldn't delay your wedding because of that.", "Nta\n\nI dont think i even have to say why", "That's ridiculous! You don't need to put your lives on hold to appease her. Who cares who gets married first? If you get pregnant first is she going to ask you to abort it because they wanted to be first? Where does it end?", "NTA.  There's zero reason for your life to revolve around your sister.  You don't have to stop your life until she's ready.  Ditto, the family's life or the rest of the world should not revolve around your sister.", "NTA.  They are choosing to prioritize a big wedding over being married.  She doesn\u2019t get to hijack your relationship for however many years it takes them to save for the wedding they want.  It\u2019s not like her wedding will be less special just because someone else got married before her.", "NTA. When did we start using the word \"fault\" for inducing a good thing?", "NTA. She wants summer and wasn't set on a particular date that you're somehow blocking; and she's the one who's already delayed. No obligation for you to wait for her to get married. At the same time, it sounds like some family members might not show; so I guess the practical question is whether and how much you care about some people holding this incident against you as their reason for not showing up.", "Definitely NTA here. It's been mentioned that there's no date set for your sister's wedding, plus you and your own fianc\u00e9 have plans of your own, which should also be respected. \n\nIf anything, I'd say that your sister is more TA here considering that they couldn't sort out their own wedding, coupled with the fact that she can't be happy for your own happiness.", "Hard NTA. So idk if this is even relevant, but I hope it shows that you should have the exact wedding you want, when you want it. My husband's stepsister was engaged about 6 months before we were. I always knew I wanted to elope. Long story short, when I was in high school, my folks told me that I could have a wedding or a down-payment for a house. And I'm practical so I wanted the house. It was fun telling my future inlaws that neither my family, nor theirs would be invited to a ceremony. I got a lot of a crap for it. But me and my hubs got married in a beautiful suite with a couple friends and it was wonderful. Fast forward 6 months, his brother got engaged as well, and set the date 2 weeks out from his stepsister's wedding, for the following summer. So that meant 2 weddings within 2 weeks of each other. I will never forget his mother thanking me during one of the rehearsal dinners for eloping. YOU DO YOU!", "NTA. You have no obligation to put your life on hold for years just  cos someone else is engaged. Especially if they are taking their sweet time getting married. \n\nIf you got engaged a month before her wedding and then got married like 2 days before, I could understand her feeling cross.\n\nBut she's been engaged for over 2 years and at this rate its not even clear if her wedding will be next year. You simply are not obligated to put your wedding off to accommodate her demands.\n\nIgnore her and any family telling you otherwise.", "NTA and you were very generous to even consider holding of until next year - but then no more.  I sure wouldn't have.", "NTA.\n\nthis is just... bonkers!\n\nyou have to put your wedding on hold until she is married. then you have to wait getting pregnant until she had a child. and how dare you have a child of the opposite gender as hers. sis has to have the first girl, the first boy. *if* she is able to conceive and carry to terms naturally, that is. what if she needs ivf? they can't save for their wedding, how will they save for the rounds of ivf?\n\netc etc pp\n\nsis calling dibs on being married first sounds silly? it is!\n\nenjoy your wedding and to make it be drama free, uninvite all people who think her 'request' is reasonable.\n\nyour wedding, your rules, your day to shine, your date, your guest list, your usher / bouncer who will make sure that miss drama and her cohorts will not ruin this day.", "I... what?  I mean, of course NTA.  How does this make any sense at all?  Why would anyone be on her side here?\n\nAre you from some bizarre culture where children have to marry in alphabetical order or something?", "NTA. She expects you to hold out on your life cause they can\u2019t manage their finances properly? Yikes.", "Have the wedding you want when you want. \nCan't believe your family is on her side? Someone needs to give her a reality check", "This is stupid! This same thing happened to me, except I was your sister in this scenario.\n\nMy brother proposed after my now DH and I got engaged. Due to a lot of different things, our wedding kept getting put off for 3 years, meanwhile my brother married his now wife a few months after proposing at a smaller ceremony than mine. Was I a little bummed that I couldn\u2019t have mine as fast as him, sure, but I put that aside because I was more than anything happy for him. He is my brother, his happiness is my happiness. That goes for all my siblings. It would\u2019ve never even crossed my mind to ask him to postpone his! And my family would not have taken my side if I did. \n\nNTA!", "NTA", "Why do people flip out over this shit? Why are you beholden to her need to have a big wedding she can't actually afford? Who cares how long she's been engaged and who gets married first? Your sister's an asshole. Your family is ridiculous too if they support her bratty entitlement.", "NTA", "NTA. As long as you aren\u2019t getting married the same month as her it\u2019s fine. Because the point is for you to not steal her moment, but it\u2019s not your fault that she can\u2019t afford to get married sooner.\n\nEdit to add: your sister is an idiot for trying to have a big wedding that she can\u2019t afford. This is literally why people can\u2019t afford to buy The Bare Necessities along with rent because they live outside of their financial Lane.", "Weddings are dumb all together tell your sister to get over it they are not marrying because they have cold feet", "NTA You can't be expected to put your life on hold because she can't get her crap together. She doesn't even know when she is getting married, and there is no guarantee she will ever pull it off.\n\nMarriage isn't a competition where whoever gets across the finish line first wins. You might want to ask her if she expects you to postpone having children until she has hers, or if you are allowed to buy a house first too.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like an AH.", "NTA. Your sister and family suck. I would be very cautious of inviting them to your wedding. Who knows what drama they will cause.", "NTA.  \"Sorry but I don't want a long engagement!\"  \n\nI don't get it, but whatever.  Lots of people want to waste their money on a day.  You want a small wedding.  Just tell her that while you respect what she wants you are asking she does the same for you.  You two plan on being married in a small, inexpensive backyard wedding and would like to do so sooner rather than later.", "NYA! Your plans with your fiance have nothing to do with her and she is sounding spoiled and entitled. Seriously what right does she have to demand this? I get asking initially.

Never heard of the younger sibling pulling this.  It\u2019s equally stupid either way.  There are no dependencies on weddings!  They are separate!", "I had 2 cousins (sisters) who raced each other to get married and how big their weddings would be.  One was in August of 1992, the other was in December.  The one in December divorced 4 years later after several years of abuse; the August wedding divorced after year 10 due to her need of therapy from her own mom issues and not being able to have kids.\n\nI realize that this is only one anecdote, but racing to wed and having a wedding thunder contest doesn't usually end up well.\n\nSister is focused more on her \"dream wedding\" than the actual marriage."]}
