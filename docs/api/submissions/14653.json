Nobody gets dibs or gets to set rules on when you can get married.  That\u2019s just ridiculous.  I have zero idea why anyone would think otherwise.  And if she wants to elope why does anyone care?  If they don\u2019t get a say in her eloping or not why do they think they get a say in your wedding?   I\u2019d just not invite anyone who wasn\u2019t being supportive.

It sounds like if she wanted to be first bad enough she could have opted for a smaller wedding. Just ignore her and enjoy your day!", "Definitely NTA. You can choose to get married whenever you want. Other people shouldn't make this a competition of who gets married first, it's ridiculous. If your sister can't afford a wedding right now, that's on her. You shouldn't delay your wedding because of that.", "Nta\n\nI dont think i even have to say why", "That's ridiculous! You don't need to put your lives on hold to appease her.

She wants summer and wasn't set on a particular date that you're somehow blocking; and she's the one who's already delayed. No obligation for you to wait for her to get married. At the same time, it sounds like some family members might not show; so I guess the practical question is whether and how much you care about some people holding this incident against you as their reason for not showing up.", "Definitely NTA here. It's been mentioned that there's no date set for your sister's wedding, plus you and your own fianc\u00e9 have plans of your own, which should also be respected. \n\nIf anything, I'd say that your sister is more TA here considering that they couldn't sort out their own wedding, coupled with the fact that she can't be happy for your own happiness.", "Hard NTA. So idk if this is even relevant, but I hope it shows that you should have the exact wedding you want, when you want it. My husband's stepsister was engaged about 6 months before we were. I always knew I wanted to elope. Long story short, when I was in high school, my folks told me that I could have a wedding or a down-payment for a house. And I'm practical so I wanted the house. It was fun telling my future inlaws that neither my family, nor theirs would be invited to a ceremony. I got a lot of a crap for it. But me and my hubs got married in a beautiful suite with a couple friends and it was wonderful. Fast forward 6 months, his brother got engaged as well, and set the date 2 weeks out from his stepsister's wedding, for the following summer. So that meant 2 weddings within 2 weeks of each other. I will never forget his mother thanking me during one of the rehearsal dinners for eloping. YOU DO YOU!", "NTA. You have no obligation to put your life on hold for years just  cos someone else is engaged. Especially if they are taking their sweet time getting married. \n\nIf you got engaged a month before her wedding and then got married like 2 days before, I could understand her feeling cross.\n\nBut she's been engaged for over 2 years and at this rate its not even clear if her wedding will be next year.

I mean, of course NTA.  How does this make any sense at all?

Due to a lot of different things, our wedding kept getting put off for 3 years, meanwhile my brother married his now wife a few months after proposing at a smaller ceremony than mine. Was I a little bummed that I couldn\u2019t have mine as fast as him, sure, but I put that aside because I was more than anything happy for him. He is my brother, his happiness is my happiness. That goes for all my siblings. It would\u2019ve never even crossed my mind to ask him to postpone his!

As long as you aren\u2019t getting married the same month as her it\u2019s fine.

She doesn't even know when she is getting married, and there is no guarantee she will ever pull it off.\n\nMarriage isn't a competition where whoever gets across the finish line first wins. You might want to ask her if she expects you to postpone having children until she has hers, or if you are allowed to buy a house first too.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like an AH.", "NTA. Your sister and family suck. I would be very cautious of inviting them to your wedding. Who knows what drama they will cause.", "NTA.  \"Sorry but I don't want a long engagement!\"  \n\nI don't get it, but whatever.  Lots of people want to waste their money on a day.

She and her partner got engaged a few years before I did, I had planned to have a big wedding a year after we got engaged and my sister started losing her mind over it because I'm younger than her, own a house (she doesn't), and could afford to plan a wedding.

At no point did we try to take her date, it was literally just about what was available in our area and didn't conflict with the 4 other weddings we were supposed to attend. We tried to explain that it was logistical and that nearly 3 weeks apart in very different cities (she lives near family, I live 3-5hours away from everyone) is plenty of time for family to come to both, but she decided to stop talking to me for a year instead.\n\nFast forward a few months, I had everything planned and deposits paid. She hadn't even found a venue or dress or even chosen a theme, and had only decided on that specific date. Then the pandemic hit. Everyone who was supposed to get married that year either postponed their weddings or chose to have micro weddings. We opted to get married in our backyard with a couple friends. It was great! That was in 2020. My sister is still not married. She does not have any plans to get married in the next few years. She has since gotten over her nonsense and we're back to talking because she realized that my plans had nothing to do with her.\n\nAnyway, the point is that while your sister is being super petty and not making any sense right now, if you don't let her bullshit control your life she will eventually pull her head out of her ass and get over it for the sake of having a relationship.

It was such a disaster. \n\nOne example: they hosted the event on my parents\u2019 property and refused to put the address on their invites because they expected people to just KNOW where to go if they truly cared for the bride/groom. Theres obvious inherent problems with this. Additionally, we lived in the country, an average 45 minutes from where most people lived, and many of the guests were friends or patients from my father\u2019s practice. Sister admitted to assuming people would ask my parents for the address and then use Mapquest (pre-google maps) to get directions.  They didn\u2019t put any markers out on the roads to indicate direction or which driveway to use (we had two, one blocked off). People tried to make it and just gave up and went home (a 2 hour round trip for nothing). She was upset at the lack of attendance. \n\nWhich is HILARIOUS because they also decided to do catering from walmart. They ordered party appetizer platters, and based the number of platters needed based on total estimated servings and guest list size (which they also didn\u2019t include RSVPs, so that made it especially difficult).  Only issue is that they are appetizer platters, not intended for full meals. So while a platter might say \u201c30-40 guests\u201d, as a full meal it would maybe serve 4-5 people as a full meal.  Sister never told my mother how many people she invited (apparently over 300), no rsvp to base ordering, so my mother purchased 10 of these platters thinking \u201cwell if 100 people show up, then we have 3x the food\u201d. Final attendance was around 150 and the food was gone in 10 minutes. I had a handful of grapes for dinner. No other food and too far out for delivery. She also purchased a beautiful 3 tier massive cake but served plain sheet cake because the actual wedding cake was just for them. 2 Costco sheet cakes for 150 people. When I tell you I took a corner piece, I mean I took a 6\u201dx6\u201d piece and finished in 5 minutes. \n\nSister later confessed to not including address/map, wedding register (another story), or rsvp card/envelope because the invite design she liked was multi-paged and those three pieces would have increased cost, something the groom thought was wasteful (he didn\u2019t understand why invites were even necessary and protested sending them out). \n\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg.", "Fact", "Hahaha.
