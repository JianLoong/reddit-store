One of my kids Ellie (21) came out as trans two years ago after moving out for college. He was born a boy but now he's a girl.  My husband, her siblings and I are supportive of her. However my parents (both over 80) have had a hard to understand what her perspective is. I mean you can't really blame them, they're old and don't understand too much these kind of things, we live in a place that's not even that open to gay people so it's hard for them sometimes to remember to use the right pronouns. This has caused a big fight between my daughter and my parents because according to her my parents are disrespectful of her gender identity. Because of that fight they don't speak to each other anymore. \n\nMy daughter Emily (f25) got married last week. We got seated together in her reception, it was our family (me, my husband and kids) and my parents (bride's grandparents), there was another table with the same layout for the grooms family (parents, siblings and grandparents) we knew that this was gonna be this way because my daughter told us. Emily asked Ellie and her grandparents to behave. I did the same, I told them that if it's better they should just ignore each other, act like the other is not there. The three of them agreed because of Emily. \n\nThe big day came and everything was going well. My parents did as they promised and ignored Ellie, Ellie did the same for the most part. She was chatting with her siblings for the most part, my husband and I were chatting with my parents too. Well but then Ellie had a couple drinks and she blew up at my parents for ignoring her (although that's what they were supposed to do), she called them all sort of names including transphobic because they'd rather not have a granddaughter that have a trans granddaughter. \n\nMy husband and I were very ashamed and Emily was very sad because this kinda ruined the joy of the wedding. I took Ellie out and I told her to leave, before she left I also told her she was a troublemaker and that all she did everything she was supposed to not do. I reminded her that she wasn't being civil because of her grandparents, but it was for her own sister who loves her and is supportive of her. This was for Emily and her husband, not any of us. \n\nShe said that clearly neither of us love her enough because we didn't took her side, she wants us to cut my parents off but that's unfair and not that easy. She left when her Uber arrived and she hasn't contacted any of us yet.", "created_utc": 1680439550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129k90u/aita_for_calling_my_trans_daughter_a_troublemaker/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It must be difficult for your daughter to be herself in a world that is unfortunately often unkind to trans people, but in this case she was in the wrong and she did start an argument at the worst possible place and time.\n\nI am about six decades younger than your parents and have a transgender sibling, and even I sometimes struggle to use the correct name and pronoun, because for the majority of the time that my sibling has been alive I have attached their facial features, my memories of them etc. to a specific name and gender, and I now need to recode all of this. I try and get it right most of the time, but mistakes do happen. It takes time and practice for me as a young person, and for someone decades older than me cognitive aging means that this is an even bigger struggle. So as long as your parents are trying, I don't believe they are assholes for failing from time to time.\n\nIt is understandable that this is very frustrating for your daughter, and it is incredibly sad for her that this has caused her to lose the relationship to people she loves and was likely much closer to previously. \n\nIgnoring each other was the least bad option, and the only one that could guarantee no misgendering/deadnaming by accident. However, it must have still been very painful for your daughter to sit so close to people who she previously had a relationship with and be completely ignored by them, even if they were just following your request. \n\nThat being said, weddings are not the place or time to resolve big family disputes, and since there was an agreement on how to handle this difficult situation, this agreement, no matter how shitty, should have been followed by all parties and complained about and amended before the next family event at a later time. \n\nI think telling your daughter off in the heat of the moment while emotions were running high was not the smartest thing to do, but is a very \"human\" reaction that does not make you an asshole.

Again, beware nuance to follow.\n\nFor starters, watch out for the misgendering in your post: It's never okay to use \"he\" to refer to your daughter.  \n\nI'm going to assume it's an innocent misusage since I get that you were just giving background and the rest of the post uses she.  You can use AMAB (assigned male at birth).\n\nRegardless of age, it shouldn't be too hard for your parents to remember Ellie = she, especially if they remember to call her Ellie and don't deadname her.   I'm going to assume they use \"she/her/hers\" sometimes and \"he/him/his\" other times.\n\nBy the way, it's very good you don't deadname Ellie in your post, you see that too often.  \n\nNext: YTA for telling her she's a troublemaker.

Perhaps that should have been thought of.\n\nNow, are you and Emily wrong to ask Ellie to play nice for Emily's sake?  I'm going to say no.  It's big ask of Ellie, but an understandable one.  As long as your parents don't do anything beyond using the improper pronoun when referring to Ellie, she should have been able to deal.  Her asking your family to cut off your parents because of pronouns is a bridge too far.\n\nNow, if your parents do more than just use the wrong pronoun occasionally, then that would change everything. \n\nYou seem like your heart it is the right place in general, but that you let exasperation / embarrassment dictate your word choice.

I'm not saying she is wrong for being upset with your parents, but time and place matters. \nIt's funny how people want to to respect their feelings but if your feelings are different then you're wrong.", "Lol, yes, but it is much easier for them since they're not being the one rejected by family members they thought loved them. Your daughter is going through a lot, have some compassion. Your parents are just being assholes for the sake of rules they learned long ago and refuse to question, at the cost of their grandchild. These are not the same thing.", "You expect your parents to ignore your daughter \n\nYou expect your daughter to be fine with being rejected by her grandparents and have it made obvious by them ignoring her at a family event. \n\nThose are not the same compromise, not even close", "Just want to highlight here that your parents\u2019 part of the compromise was to be silent with their abuse, but they were still allowed to abuse their granddaughter by shunning her *with your blessing*.  Ellie tried to graciously accept the shunning for the sake of your family but it was too hard and she snapped.  This is not the same.  The fact that you see it as Ellie\u2019s fault shows that the apple didn\u2019t fall far from the transphobe tree.  \n\nYou failed your daughter.", "if you full accepted your child you wouldn't expect them to compromise and accept someone else's bigotry", "Was the only evidence of your parents\u2019 \u201ctransphobia\u201d that they\u2019d slip up and use the wrong pronouns?", "It\u2019s not the same at all. Having people who are supposed to be your family shun you and act like you\u2019re not there is hurtful.", ">Notice how all the misgendering is 100% in the past?\n\n\"but now he's a girl\"", "I'm not here to debate or argue, merely pass my judgement.", "The one getting married right?", "That is still misgendering. You don\u2019t use the former pronouns, period", "I'm hugely assuming but still. \n\nI can understand why she would agree tho. If multiple people including your parents, siblings and grandparents are saying it would be better to ignore each other, you'd just agree. However, on the day this 'solution' backfired and it's not difficult to see how from Ellie's perspective. Ellie was on her own, at least her grandparents had each other. I'm assuming that Ellie's grandparents greeted, hugged, complimented and chatted with her parents and siblings. Meanwhile, Ellie wasn't even acknowledged. OP even says that Ellie mostly spoke to her siblings and the grandparents mostly spoke to her parents. So it's unlikely the parents were going to involve Ellie in their conversations. It's her sister's wedding so her sister couldn't be with her 100% of the time. Unsure about the other sibling, but did anybody notice that Ellie was getting drunk or even was being pushed to drink as a way of coping with the situation? From the information provided, it feels like Ellie ended up being alone for most of the wedding, had an outburst out of frustration and then left the wedding alone drunk. Meanwhile, everyone else continued to have fun at a wedding that Ellie wasn't even enjoying and the grandparents and their transphobia 'won'. In the end, Ellie no longer agreed with the 'solution'. She definitely should've gone about this better. But maybe she did try to, maybe she tried to join in on her grandparents and parents' conversation was further ignored. \n\nEither way, the fact that Ellie hasn't contracted anybody after this is hugely concerning. Nobody seems to be mentioning that.", "I don't understand how that's considered a \"solution\". \"Just pretend your grandchild doesn't exist, and she'll pretend you don't exist!\" I mean, it just sounds like they're giving the grandparents what they want (trans-people to not exist) and she just gets to watch her grandparents interact with the rest of the family and remember what it was like having grandparents that didn't hate her.", "Same. Ellie\u2019s outburst is not a good look, but OP being fine with the bigotry towards Ellie is worse too. Being old isn\u2019t a ticket to shun family because of their gender identity. Also: wtf was Emily thinking, putting them at the same table?", "Because Emily agrees with her parents and grandparents, and sees Ellie being trans at best as an embarrassment; Ellie *had* to sit with people who actively misgender her with no avenue of escape because socially it presents an image that the family is oh so accepting of her; an image that was stripped away when Ellie voiced her displeasure. The embarrassment isn't the argument per se, it's what the argument says about the reputation of her FOO.", "Age is not an excuse, My Nana (my great grandmother), was nearly 90 when she died and she wasn\u2019t transphobic or homophobic, she even called other people out on it, so no, they don\u2019t get to pull the \u2018oh but her grandparents are old\u2019 card, because they\u2019re just not willing to try", "Exactly.  OP was demonstrating the transition and clearly uses the proper gender afterwards.  But Reddit gonna Reddit.", "No, OP said \"sometimes\" they mess up the pronouns which I understood as they do call her \"her\", but sometimes they call her \"him\".", "In no circumstance is it reasonable for someone to blow up over being called the wrong pronoun though. Seems like Ellie is just an AH that can\u2019t handle a few drinks", "She used improper pronouns in the beginning of the post for clarification, but I didn't notice her do it anywhere else", "When did she misgender her? She explained the transition, but then used she the rest of the time.", "But, they are. They\u2019re aware that the rest of the family rejects their opinion on the matter. They\u2019re seemingly receiving less sympathy and support than the trans-daughter is.", "Right. If someone couldn\u2019t accept my trans kid, I wouldn\u2019t be casually socializing with them.", "Doubtful, since OP also used the wrong pronouns for her daughter. \n\n>\u201dHe was born a boy but now he\u2019s a girl\u201d \n\nI feel like the transphobia of the grandparents is much more deliberate, especially since they would rather shun their granddaughter than improve their relationship with her.", "TBH, I find this argument frustrating - when transgender posts come up, I always find it difficult to follow along with the pronouns in the beginning.  OP is explaining clearly that: \n\n1. They had a boy \n2. Boy came out two years ago. \n3. Now that boy is a girl. \n\nIgnoring the pronouns of the past when explaining the transition is NOT misgendering.  It\u2019s confusing for people who weren\u2019t there for the transition.", "Tell me one other time that the OP did not use she/her pronouns in the present. The use of her former pronouns was to emphasize the transition not misgender her.", "I don't see how ellie was on her own? No siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends or anything therewho know and accept her? \n\nI also didn't say out want understandable. But that doesn't put ellie in the right either. I bet the bride snapped a few times while planning the wedding. But if someone was hurt by her snapping, she'd still be the asshole. \n\nI don't see how transphobia \"won\" given that ellie was there, as her true self, presenting as female, and the only thing was \"don't talk to these two people.\" Does it suck that ellie doesn't have a relationship with her grandparents due to their bigotry? Of course! And they're the adults for that. However it is ellie fault that she got drunk and made a scene at the wedding. That was her choice.", "I think that's way more common than you think. I've had interactions like that within my own family. I was not involved with any such discussions, I was just informed that's what was happening. \n\nEllie was there as a woman in a dress (as she should have been). If you think the grandparents were getting what they wanted, your dead wrong.\n\nWhy does interactions not apply the same in reverse? \n\nThe grand parents just get to watch her interact with the rest of the family and remember what it was like having a grandchild that didn't hate them.", "Right? And watching them ignore her as if she was dirt on their shoe and her presence was so offensive that silence was the only option.  It\u2019s gross.", "As someone pointed out, it\u2019s a memory of past and so OP uses he. I have friends with trans children and I\u2019ve heard them do the same thing. In the early days, they would often accidentally misgender or deadname, too, just from habit. Grace is required on both sides.", "\"Now he's a girl\" is misgendering her lol. That's present tense. You don't emphasize someone's transition by misgendering them in present tense. The use of it in the past tense is more understandable, but still iffy since trans people are not just \"boys who decided to be girls\" or vice versa, they were always the gender that they are transitioning to and their assigned gender at birth doesn't match. For that reason, saying \"he used to be a boy but now he's a girl\" is still incorrect even disregarding the misgendering.", "It's still a misgendering, even if it's an understandable one.  The point for trans people is **they didn't change, they became aware that nature done fucked up.**  The daughter was NEVER a he.", "Bingo.", "My sister is trans, so I know what you mean. But if I\u2019m talking about her in the past, I still use she. That\u2019s what she prefers and it makes the most sense. \n\nMy parents slip up all the time. But, there is a difference between misgendering someone by accident and misgendering someone on purpose (my mom does it when she is mad at my sister, my dad just messes up).", "That is not a universal belief among trans people", "To OP she was. You can\u2019t negate OP\u2019s lived experience. She HAD a son, she now has a daughter.", "I get that. I just don\u2019t understand why everyone has jumped straight to \u201cthey are transphobes\u201d when they may have just had difficulty adjusting. It sounds like Ellie went off on *them* which I find easy to believe when she also lost the plot at her sister\u2019s wedding, which was grossly unfair."]}
