That said, your approach in your explanation to him is also pretty rude and makes assumptions about how easy it would be for him to lose weight.

It may be a lot more difficult for him than it would be for you.", "TDLR:\n\n-His being fat may not be why the mattress is uncomfortable. MF mattresses feel like wood to me and I'm skinny.\n\n-He has to deal with it or bring an air mattress with him or something.\n\n-Don't stop, but just be tactful pointing out reasons why being thinner is better. Ignore the \"Genetics!\" & \"Fat shamer!\" AHs, whining uses less calories than learning and doing.\n\nNTA.", "I like your style.", "Like that would be an acceptable option - dude just shows up with a mattress to replace the one OP currently has and likes?", "Or why can\u2019t OP stay at his place? It sounds like he wants her to accommodate him as her guest but what if OP stayed at his and said she doesn\u2019t like the mattress and he needs to get a new one? \n\nAlternatively, if he pays or the OP compromises on equal contribution then she can get a bed with two different mattresses under the cover one. Maybe they even offer a discount if she trades in the current one. \n\nFat shaming was not cool but tbh heavier you are the lbs usually go faster cause your body needs to burn more energy to carry the weight. He should definitely not do it for the mattress but for his long term health.", "Thanks for adding how it takes awhile to adjust. I want a memory foam mattress but I would have never known that!", "Yes, it's not \"easy\" for the partner to lose weight, or he wouldn't be obese.  Eating disorders, injuries that prevent exercise, sleep disorders, medication side effects--there could be a lot of different things contributing to his weight.", "Good point", "No kidding.  I am normal weight (only my opinion as everyone else thinks i am thin, including my husband and doctor), and i hate memory foam, it causes my body to really hurt all over.  It just isn't for everyone.", "Yeah, I am the normal weight for my height, fairly short, and memory foam seriously messes me up. I get so achy I can\u2019t sleep, I ache all day, it is awful. \n\nI can see why OP doesn\u2019t want to invest that much money in a new mattress, especially if money is tight. But it does say something about the quality of their relationship that they can\u2019t figure out some compromise that will let him be comfortable in her home.", "Genetics have nothing to do with weight since you don\u2019t defy the laws of thermodynamics", "Well, he can't replace it. So maybe he should just strap it to his back and lug it back and forth every time he's over!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "She could always sell the mattress to Kramer.\n\nAlso, NTA!", "This could work. But he definitely fork\u2019s over the money for it", "[removed]", "I'm a bit of a lumberjack sized man, and my memory foam bed in a box from Amazon (some knock-off brand) is the best sleep I've ever gotten, even 5 years after I bought it.  I love this thing.\n\nI don't think there's any real good way to nail down what type of mattress a person is going to sleep well on until laying and sleeping on it.", "I prefer traditional but love having am adjustable bed. When we went to the mattress store last time all my favorite mattresses I tested they said wouldn't work with an adjustable.", "Nope. There can be a lot of other issues at play including underlying health issues. Calorie deficits typically work; but they're not foolproof and can fail.

Go stay at his house.", "I dont see why not. They're dating and he's staying over most of the week. She would know if there was a medical issue connected to the weight.

Much like BMI it doesnt mean anything. \n\nFat bias is inherent in most parts of the world and it kills people.

Plus, I already have a mattress!", ">\"Obese\" is an outdated medical term.\n\nAccording to who?", "You know what kills more? Obesity", "My spouse who is in medical school.", "Please prove this. I'll wait. \n\n\nAlso alcohol abuse kills people at a much higher rate than people realize, and it is a cultural norm worldwide.

No obese is not outdated.", "Edit to add: a quick Google search and WHO lists the obesity death rates as 4.7 million and 3 million for alcohol worldwide for the most accurate answer. I'm not going to include a link , I assume you have access to Google\n\n\nEdit#2: for America alone obesity is the second leading cause of death behind tobacco sitting at 300k (https://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Institutes,the%20obesity%20epidemic%20(57).) and alcohol abuse (see CDC stats)at 140k, less than half.\n\n\nChecking some worldwide stats instead of just going the easy route and targeting America alone you can see that cardiovascular disease is the number one killer. Cardiovascular disease is also the number one cause of death for obesity. It's harder to find or accurately report obese directly related deaths as people don't die from obesity alone, it usually causes another issue you can die from.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death\n\nAlcohol use disorder related deaths don't even crack 200k and cardiovascular is almost 19 million. I mean but we all know alcohol is bad. It's age gated, we have treatment families for it and the world in general is shaming it more. Canada recently put out a alcohol consumption guide stating the having 2 drinks a week is your max if you don't want health related issues from alcohol. Many MANY new options for drinking non alcoholic drinks are being thrust into the market, which is super trendy right now. We are actually discouraging using drinking work events as a way to network, letting people know it's ok to not drink, ok to not have to go to the events to be a good employee. I'm sure MORE people are drinking simply due to the sheer stress of the pandemic but good lord we aren't campaigning to continue it's celebration or acceptance in society. It is sold and advertised to us everywhere but that comes with the notion of not abusing it. Majority of people can recognize that abuse of alcohol is bad. \n\nWe are however normalizing abuse for food as a good thing. \n\nYes these stats are from 2018, that's hardly old either.", "Medical guidelines are not what im concerned with, more so the studies that are finally being done regarding how larger people are treated in medicine. If you are actually a physician, then you should know that fat people are misdiagnosed and receive worse care than people of more average size.\n\nOne big thing I have learned is that medical education is in need of an update. I've also learned that just because someone is a physician doesn't mean they're intelligent and open minded, they're probably just good at their job in their little slice of the medical field.\n\nSome of her \" actual medical practitioner\" preceptors agree with her BTW, and the group of fellow med students who are actively trying to get the curriculum updated. \n\nSo sorry, but I'm going to keep trusting the future of medicine who are looking to challenge long held outdated beliefs.", "Nobody said any of those things are acceptable, nor even came close to implying it."]}
