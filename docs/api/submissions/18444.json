If he wants it that much - why can't he buy it?", "Coming from someone who could lose a little weight (no where near your BF's tho), NTA.\n\nHe's got one of three options. \n\n1) Put up and shut up.\n\n2) Buy a whole new single bed with his own money and his choice of mattress for the spare room.\n\n3) Only stay over a night or two at a time - or not at all.\n\nWe have the memory foam and I personally think it's the best support.  And it did take my back a while to adjust but I now can't sleep in any other bed.", "NTA, though the cause may just be that y\u2019all have different tastes in mattresses. I got 2 other siblings and we\u2019re like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears. Youngest likes it firm, I like it soft and the middle child likes it just average.", "NTA. While you are not really living together you have every right to have whatever kind of matrass you wish and you are not obligated to buy a new one just for him.", "NTA.\n\nIf he needs weight proof furniture for himself in other people\u2019s place, he should buy it.", "NTA. Maybe he should buy it since he so desperately needs it.", "NTA, while telling him to \u2018not be obese\u2019 is a bit much, so is demanding you purchase another new bed", "NTA sometimes the truth hurts", "I\u2019m torn on this one, OP. You are obviously not an ah for refusing to buy a different bed\u2026however, you definitely are an ah for saying \u201che could easily lose weight and everything would be fine in a couple months\u201d. Really? You know that for a fact? See all the responses about how memory foam fails a bunch of folks who aren\u2019t overweight.\n\nI think ESH based on your crappy attitude towards your partner\u2019s weight and his insistence that you\u2019re the one who should be paying for a new bed when you two don\u2019t live together.", "INFO: Do you love him? Do you want him to feel welcome in your house and like he is important to you?", "It\u2019s a bit of a tough one but NTA, it\u2019s kind of unfair of him to expect you to pay for a whole new mattress, f he offered to buy it or go halves I would be more understanding. Ultimately though it is a bit of a him issue, it hurts, I know, I really do but he can\u2019t expect you to spend hundreds of dollars to accomodate him if you don\u2019t have the money laying around.", "NTA. \n\nIf your mattress is only a year old it is highly unlikely that it is already worn out. If it has, contact the place you got it from as it is likely still under warranty. \n\nIs there a reason why you can\u2019t spend more time at your boyfriend\u2019s place instead? If the mattress is truly a big issue for him he should buy it himself. It is completely unreasonable for him to demand you fund it.", "NTA\nYou got the new mattress a year ago and he\u2019s just now complaining about it? If you lived together or are talking about doing so then yea sure you need to do something so you are both comfortable. He could have said something a year ago though and you would have likely been able to exchange instead of just being out the money.", "YWBTA if you started on about his weight instead of just telling him to either shove it or buy you a new mattress. You cannot 100% state that the reason is his weight, even if it's the likely scenario.", "ESH", "NTA, if someone is requiring you to buy new furniture for their benefit without chipping in, that's not OK.  \nYou suck a bit for assuming it's his weight and saying 'he could easily lose weight' without any visible empathy; it's not always easy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I got a five dollar regular sized pillow and stopped using two or more queen sized flatter pillows and no more back problems.", "NTA. When my parents had this issue,  dad just threw a couple boards he bought under his side of the bed to firm it up a little. Worked great for him, and was WAY cheaper than buying a new mattress.  Maybe your boyfriend could try something similar? Either way,  not your fault.", "NTA he can buy the heavyweight bed or eat less/move more.", "What makes you think it's already worn out? There's no issue with the mattress for the person who doesn't exceed its recommended weight limit.", "Last year and a year ago are two different things.", "The AH bit for me is the comment, \u201che could easily loose weight and everything would be fine in a couple of months\u201d. 1) loosing weight is not easy for everyone 2) a couple of months, that\u2019s a quick turnaround depending on the weight 3) there is no guarantee that it would make a difference and therefore be fine.", "Yep.  I can\u2019t sleep on memory foam.  I stayed at a friends and my back killed me and I\u2019m not overweight.  I need a more firm mattress because I have back issues.  Memory foam doesn\u2019t cut it for me."]}
