But the attitude you have of \"as long as I'm comfortable,  it's his problem\" does not bode well for the long term health of this relationship.", "ESH. Yeah it's not a good look for him to demand you get a whole new bed, but \"just losing weight\" isn't always accessable for people. A friend of mine for example has severe chronic pain that makes exercise hard or sometimes impossible, and can't get help for it because doctors say to \"just lose weight\". He eats the least I've ever seen and I've been cooking for him to help him out because, you know, chronic pain, so I know he's not just eating nothing but junk. He's starting to lose weight, but it's slow going and honestly that's the healthier way to do it - depending on your bf's weight it could take YEARS to slim down enough in a healthy way.", "NTA. This is your bed in your house. If he wants another mattress there, he's got to buy it himself. If your tastes / requirements in mattresses differ a lot, you could buy two different single-person mattresses that can be placed together in the bed. We have that and it feels like one mattress apart from the little 'seam' in the middle. But so everyone can have the mattress he/she wants. But he should be funding it.", "NTA  If he doesn't like your bed, maybe he should stay at his house and sleep in his bed. You are not required to furnish your home to suit him.

Let him host you.", "YTA.\n\nHe's expressing he would like to be comfortable when he spends time with you.\n\nIf you don't have the money to buy a new matress just maturely talk about this with him without blaming his weight. He's likely obese, but this is a condition and you need to be understanding that it may be a difficult thing to address.\n\nIf you care about him, don't fat shame him (even out of concern) be open and kind and you're likely to get the same in return and be able to find a compromise.", "Not sure he could EASILY lose weight. Diets are ineffective 85-90% of the time and it gets lower chances the more fat someone is. The whole body fights weight loss. That said, that's pretty entitled to expect you to buy a new mattress for him. He could offer to buy one or just not sleep overnight at your place. NTA", "I hate memory foam and I'm nowhere near 250. I don't care what it's rated for or whatever, it's uncomfortable. You sink into a body shaped hole, basically. So it might not have anything to do with his weight, maybe he just hates it. I don't think you're obligated to pay for another mattress but you can't say all he has to do is lose weight, either. I guess NAH. You have a right to your mattress but it's not his fault your mattress sucks.", "NTA for not wanting to pay for a new bed, but the way you treat weight loss as something so simple is rather callous.  He should at least offer to pay half, like a partner would, if he is asking for a new mattress for his comfort sleeping over.\n\nWe got a memory foam bed when I was under 250 lbs and that thing hurt my back from the beginning.  I deal with it to save money, but it can be pretty brutal.", "There's also a fourth option - it might be okay with a mattress topper. I couldn't sleep on my partner's very firm mattress for even a night without getting backache, so we bought a topper to put on my half and it was fine. We didn't have the option of another bed.", "4. Lose some weight, so that he can comfortably use the bed *and* reduce the long-term health risks that come with extreme obesity", "Exactly this. \n\nLosing weight isn't as easy as poor meal choices for everyone and until you are in his shoes you really can't assess how much effort anything is. \n\nHe certainly shouldn't make demands on you or your money, though, and if this is a pattern I can understand your compassion might be wearing thin.", "This is exactly right.

Funny how much they vary.", "If they both love each other and wants what is best for them both, then they can work something out. \"You need to buy a new mattress to accommodate me\" and \"this is a YOU problem, if you weren't so lazy you could lose weight\"\" are not promising comments from either of them. This relationship will not last.\n\nNAH. You should just break up already.", "As a fellow big person, NTA.\n\nHe needs it, he can buy it.", "\"His poor weight management. He could lose weight easily\"\n\nBro just for this I'd say big YTA\n\nMaybe he's your boyfriend, but you don't know everything about him or his life. So yeah, maybe he's overweight because he eats too much bad stuff, but maybe he has some health issues, or maybe just something that is called GENETICS\n\nAlso, being overweight isn't the only reason that someone could or couldn't sleep on a memory foam mattress. Maybe he has back issues that are completely independent of his weight. You don't know. So yeah, you're still the asshole\n\nBut I'd add that if he's using the mattress too, he should financially participate at least a bit in buying a new one", "YTA - why didn't you check with your partner what kind of bed to buy?\n\nIf you start to live together, which isn't unthinkable after 2 years, you would need to throw that bed out all together. Some beds just don't lie well - as sleep is a super private thing.\n\nI dislike matrasses that are too soft, or don't disperse heat well, my wife is just the other way around. There are loads of beds that could be setup in such a way where both are happy.\n\nYou put yourself in a position to throw out 700 quid for nothing, as beds should last you a decade or so. Seems like a huge waste", "Sounds like he compromised so what's the problem? Go stay at his house.", "May get downvoted for this but I\u2019m between ESH & YTA. ESH because obviously you shouldn\u2019t have to buy a whole new mattress and your attitude should have been I bought it and I\u2019m keeping it. \n\nYTA 1. Memory foam sucks for many people for many reasons. 2. Obesity, especially chronic, is not as simple as \u201chey have you tried eating an apple?\u201d so to say that to your partner of 2 years reactively seems like you just wanted an excuse to bring up his weight problems. If you want to help, there are other ways.", "Info: is he telling YOU to BUY the new mattress, or just that you *need* a new one? Is he willing to pay for the new mattress and you just have a memory foam topper on your side?\n\nAlso, was your boyfriend staying over lots when you bought the new mattress? Did you take into consideration if he would be comfortable? \n\nYou\u2019re obviously NTA for not buying a new mattress, that\u2019s pretty silly. But your tone in this post towards him makes me wonder if you\u2019re wasting both your time being together. You don\u2019t sound to care about his comfort very much.  Losing weight may be easy for some, but for most it\u2019s not, especially if weight is due to a hormone imbalance or a sugar addiction (me!). \n\nCouples shouldn\u2019t be ME vs HIM but US vs the problem. By 2 years, don\u2019t you think it should be an US problem not a HIM problem?", "NTA - your home your mattress.\n\n\nAlso to add I'm 23ish st and I LOVE memory foam mattresses, but they have to be the 12\" or thicker ones or it's like lieing on a deflated air bed. \nPlus the first 3-5 day on a memory foam mattress you do get aches and pains as you body adjusts to the support, after that it's like sleeping on a firm but fluffy cloud, also look for a good quality topper for summer, memory foam are great in winter but foam dosnt circulate air as efficiently as a sprung mattress so it retains heat, having a topper as a barrier between you and the mattress will help you stay cool and sleep better on hot nights.\n\n\n\nEdit* to add you TA for making it about his weight. \nWeight loss isn't \"quick\" or \"easily done\" in a few weeks. \nIt can take years, lots of up and downs and a lot of positive support from loved ones, and even then it's an on going thing you can never let yourself go and tbh it can be pretty fucking miserable.", "NTA.  Sorry, but you're right about the mattress and his weight.  Has he tried to lose weight before?  It might be more complicated than simply more exercise and less calories, but has he ever tried? \n\nI am a bit overweight and was once considered medically obese - not fun.  Given that, I don't believe overweight people should automatically be catered to, for example if they need 2 airplane seats, they should buy them.  I figure this is not a popular opinion.", "NTA. You have graduated Reddit Uni: this is a you problem, not a me problem.", "NTA\n\nI had this issue with my partner, they kept sitting on my side off the bed to get dressed etc (their side is against the wall) so when it was time for a new mattress I told them to sit on the stool in the bedroom not my side of the bed as they were flattening it by sitting on it multiple times day", "NTA\n\nI'm about 21 stone, and the reason why is a combination of age (my 40s), genetics (I come from a family of large men--at 6'3\", I'm on the shorter side), and the fact that I haven't hit the gym on a regular basis since COVID began.  \n\n\nYeah, people are overweight for a lot of reasons and he might be dealing with some stuff that makes it hard to be a healthy weight, but he also can buy a mattress topper or another mattress or maybe, just maybe, you can sleep over at his place.  \n\n\nI dunno--if I found out I was too heavy for my partner's mattress, I'd be busting my ass to lose weight.", "NTA for not buying a new bed. Hm, if his own mattress is ok then perhaps he is not used to your mattress. He should not ask you to replace YOUR mattress just for him. \n\nHowever, since it hurts his back, don't expect/force him to stay over if he's not comfortable.\n\nHope you worded it nicely to your SO about his weight or there may be some tension going forth. \ud83e\udd23", "Maybe he should lose some weight or buy the mattress?", "NTA - he needs to put his wallet where his mouth is if he wants a mattress that bears his weight in your home.", "Unless he is paying for it he can't order you to buy a new one.

His issues are his to deal with.", "This. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cthis is my mattress. I bought it, I like it, and I\u2019m keeping it.\u201d It\u2019s another thing entirely to say, \u201cit just hurts you because you\u2019re fat and if you lost weight, you\u2019d be fine.\u201d Not everyone is comfortable on a memory foam mattress, regardless of weight.", "You don\u2019t need to exercise to lose weight, and you can\u2019t circumvent the laws of thermodynamics.

How soft or firm a mattress is has a lot to do with the sleep quality you\u2019ll get on it because the *ways* you sleep need to be take into account. Ex: My spouse is mostly a back sleeper, while I tend to toss around like a hurricane. We essentially decided that the one who has a harder job needs better sleep & erred on buying according to that lol. Kinda feels like OP is just looking for a reason to bully their bf. \n\nBtw OP, the vast majority of weight loss attempts only end in disordered eating, ruining your appetite & metabolism, and/or gaining more weight than you lose.

And a lot of bulimic people are huge, because purging is ineffective.", "I hated my memory foam bed because I am an extremely restless sleeper. I would wake up every time I would move because I would get semi stuck in place. It was awful.", "Yes I know BMI, mild and morbid obesity.\nAnd whole classification.\nShe intended in a condescending and derogatory way.\nShe is mocking him.\n\nWhy don't you cope harder. It is my opinion. \n\nAlso, why are being a AH in nitpicking on my points, rather than whole context, which this platform hopes to get neutral views. \n\nWhat an AH!"]}
