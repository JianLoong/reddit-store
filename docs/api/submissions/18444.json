If he wants it that much - why can't he buy it?", "Coming from someone who could lose a little weight (no where near your BF's tho), NTA.\n\nHe's got one of three options. \n\n1) Put up and shut up.\n\n2) Buy a whole new single bed with his own money and his choice of mattress for the spare room.\n\n3) Only stay over a night or two at a time - or not at all.\n\nWe have the memory foam and I personally think it's the best support.  And it did take my back a while to adjust but I now can't sleep in any other bed.", "NTA, though the cause may just be that y\u2019all have different tastes in mattresses. I got 2 other siblings and we\u2019re like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears. Youngest likes it firm, I like it soft and the middle child likes it just average.", "NTA. While you are not really living together you have every right to have whatever kind of matrass you wish and you are not obligated to buy a new one just for him.", "NTA.\n\nIf he needs weight proof furniture for himself in other people\u2019s place, he should buy it.", "NTA. Maybe he should buy it since he so desperately needs it.", "NTA, while telling him to \u2018not be obese\u2019 is a bit much, so is demanding you purchase another new bed", "NTA sometimes the truth hurts", "I\u2019m torn on this one, OP. You are obviously not an ah for refusing to buy a different bed\u2026however, you definitely are an ah for saying \u201che could easily lose weight and everything would be fine in a couple months\u201d. Really? You know that for a fact? See all the responses about how memory foam fails a bunch of folks who aren\u2019t overweight.\n\nI think ESH based on your crappy attitude towards your partner\u2019s weight and his insistence that you\u2019re the one who should be paying for a new bed when you two don\u2019t live together.", "INFO: Do you love him? Do you want him to feel welcome in your house and like he is important to you?", "It\u2019s a bit of a tough one but NTA, it\u2019s kind of unfair of him to expect you to pay for a whole new mattress, f he offered to buy it or go halves I would be more understanding. Ultimately though it is a bit of a him issue, it hurts, I know, I really do but he can\u2019t expect you to spend hundreds of dollars to accomodate him if you don\u2019t have the money laying around.", "NTA. \n\nIf your mattress is only a year old it is highly unlikely that it is already worn out. If it has, contact the place you got it from as it is likely still under warranty. \n\nIs there a reason why you can\u2019t spend more time at your boyfriend\u2019s place instead? If the mattress is truly a big issue for him he should buy it himself. It is completely unreasonable for him to demand you fund it.", "NTA\nYou got the new mattress a year ago and he\u2019s just now complaining about it? If you lived together or are talking about doing so then yea sure you need to do something so you are both comfortable. He could have said something a year ago though and you would have likely been able to exchange instead of just being out the money.", "YWBTA if you started on about his weight instead of just telling him to either shove it or buy you a new mattress. You cannot 100% state that the reason is his weight, even if it's the likely scenario.", "ESH", "NTA, if someone is requiring you to buy new furniture for their benefit without chipping in, that's not OK.  \nYou suck a bit for assuming it's his weight and saying 'he could easily lose weight' without any visible empathy; it's not always easy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I got a five dollar regular sized pillow and stopped using two or more queen sized flatter pillows and no more back problems.", "NTA. When my parents had this issue,  dad just threw a couple boards he bought under his side of the bed to firm it up a little. Worked great for him, and was WAY cheaper than buying a new mattress.  Maybe your boyfriend could try something similar? Either way,  not your fault.", "NTA he can buy the heavyweight bed or eat less/move more.", "What makes you think it's already worn out? There's no issue with the mattress for the person who doesn't exceed its recommended weight limit.", "Last year and a year ago are two different things.", "The AH bit for me is the comment, \u201che could easily loose weight and everything would be fine in a couple of months\u201d. 1) loosing weight is not easy for everyone 2) a couple of months, that\u2019s a quick turnaround depending on the weight 3) there is no guarantee that it would make a difference and therefore be fine.", "Yep.  I can\u2019t sleep on memory foam.  I stayed at a friends and my back killed me and I\u2019m not overweight.  I need a more firm mattress because I have back issues.  Memory foam doesn\u2019t cut it for me.", "Why would you need to pay for a mattress that he wants when you are happy with the one you\u2019ve got? Why is he not prepared to buy a replacement? You are right - this is a him issue. NTA", "NTA if he\u00b4s staying with you more than half of the week he basically lives there.\nSo if he wants to stay over more, maybe he should buy a new matress \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA He needs to pay for any new mattress, AND you need to like it as much as you like your current one.", "My ex and I had a memory foam mattress.  Yes, I\u2019m fat.  Yes, the bed hurt my back.\n\nAlso, yes\u2026 I purchased a new bed that didn\u2019t hurt my back.  That\u2019s when she left", "NTA.\n\nLose weight for his health and the life of your expensive mattress.", "NTA. He can buy you a new mattress if he wants as it is most definitely a HIM issue! If he doesn\u2019t want to fork out then he can shut up.", "ESH.  Memory foam isn't for everyone. I am under that weight and it still hurts my back. It's shitty of you to blame his weight right away, and it's shitty of him to put the responsibility of purchasing a whole damn mattress on you when he's the one who hates it. \nSomething has to give here but that's a post for another time.", "Gentle ESH.\nHe shouldn't be demanding and expecting you to do this for him. But the attitude you have of \"as long as I'm comfortable,  it's his problem\" does not bode well for the long term health of this relationship.", "ESH. Yeah it's not a good look for him to demand you get a whole new bed, but \"just losing weight\" isn't always accessable for people. A friend of mine for example has severe chronic pain that makes exercise hard or sometimes impossible, and can't get help for it because doctors say to \"just lose weight\". He eats the least I've ever seen and I've been cooking for him to help him out because, you know, chronic pain, so I know he's not just eating nothing but junk. He's starting to lose weight, but it's slow going and honestly that's the healthier way to do it - depending on your bf's weight it could take YEARS to slim down enough in a healthy way.", "NTA. This is your bed in your house. If he wants another mattress there, he's got to buy it himself. If your tastes / requirements in mattresses differ a lot, you could buy two different single-person mattresses that can be placed together in the bed. We have that and it feels like one mattress apart from the little 'seam' in the middle. But so everyone can have the mattress he/she wants. But he should be funding it.", "NTA  If he doesn't like your bed, maybe he should stay at his house and sleep in his bed. You are not required to furnish your home to suit him.  If he requires special furniture, then hang out at his house.  Let him host you.", "YTA.\n\nHe's expressing he would like to be comfortable when he spends time with you.\n\nIf you don't have the money to buy a new matress just maturely talk about this with him without blaming his weight. He's likely obese, but this is a condition and you need to be understanding that it may be a difficult thing to address.\n\nIf you care about him, don't fat shame him (even out of concern) be open and kind and you're likely to get the same in return and be able to find a compromise.", "Not sure he could EASILY lose weight. Diets are ineffective 85-90% of the time and it gets lower chances the more fat someone is. The whole body fights weight loss. That said, that's pretty entitled to expect you to buy a new mattress for him. He could offer to buy one or just not sleep overnight at your place. NTA", "I hate memory foam and I'm nowhere near 250. I don't care what it's rated for or whatever, it's uncomfortable. You sink into a body shaped hole, basically. So it might not have anything to do with his weight, maybe he just hates it. I don't think you're obligated to pay for another mattress but you can't say all he has to do is lose weight, either. I guess NAH. You have a right to your mattress but it's not his fault your mattress sucks.", "NTA for not wanting to pay for a new bed, but the way you treat weight loss as something so simple is rather callous.  He should at least offer to pay half, like a partner would, if he is asking for a new mattress for his comfort sleeping over.\n\nWe got a memory foam bed when I was under 250 lbs and that thing hurt my back from the beginning.  I deal with it to save money, but it can be pretty brutal.", "There's also a fourth option - it might be okay with a mattress topper. I couldn't sleep on my partner's very firm mattress for even a night without getting backache, so we bought a topper to put on my half and it was fine. We didn't have the option of another bed.", "4. Lose some weight, so that he can comfortably use the bed *and* reduce the long-term health risks that come with extreme obesity", "Exactly this. \n\nLosing weight isn't as easy as poor meal choices for everyone and until you are in his shoes you really can't assess how much effort anything is. \n\nHe certainly shouldn't make demands on you or your money, though, and if this is a pattern I can understand your compassion might be wearing thin.", "This is exactly right.  While he doesn't have the right to demand she spend money on a mattress solely for his sake, it sounds like she's thrilled to have an excuse to bully him over his weight.  ESH", "Yes, exactly \"obese\". \nIs actually OP fat-shaming her own BF.\n\nShe could say, considering the health benefits, I want to motivate or encourage him to drop a few lbs...\n\nBut that tone... ? \n\nI was with OP in the first half.\n\nSo ESH. \nOP for name calling and BF for not really stepping up with health and new mattress", "Does he love her ? Then why doesn't he buy a mattress so he can spend time with her? Why is it so important to him that she pays money for his problem?", "My memory foam mattress hurts my back because it\u2019s too firm.  Funny how much they vary.", "If they both love each other and wants what is best for them both, then they can work something out. \"You need to buy a new mattress to accommodate me\" and \"this is a YOU problem, if you weren't so lazy you could lose weight\"\" are not promising comments from either of them. This relationship will not last.\n\nNAH. You should just break up already."]}
