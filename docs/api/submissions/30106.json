For the context, I lived in a family so poor that we often lacked the most basic things (like food)and I have had after-effects, like Joey in Friends, Alice doesn't share food !!! My husband thinks that food should be shared and most of the time, I manage to control myself to agree with him. The problem being that I'm like a little squirrel and I like to put the things I like aside so that they are still there when I want to eat them (even if it's a month later).He, for his part, eats whatever he likes almost at once, and generally when I come home thinking of eating the thing I had put aside, he has of course already devoured it... What follows next? an argument over always the same reason, I had put it aside and I really wanted to eat it, I don't think it's fair to always be frustrated at the moment when I'm looking forward to eating because you didn't know how to control yourself and leave me some...\nLast time was when I bought some duck mousse that I thought I would eat with moricettes with our daughter when I didn't feel like cooking. My husband took out the duck mousse to eat, when I kindly told him that it wasn't for him because I was leaving it aside for later but that in return I had bought him some cheese and cold meats . He of course immediately got angry, accusing me of appropriating the food and that it wasn't a tragedy if he ate it now and he could have bought more.

I grew up relatively poor too and with other kids in the house so I know how you feel. I don't understand why other people think they're entitled to eat something that isn't for them, or has clearly been set aside for someone else. It's rude and inconsiderate, and not to mention very disappointing.\n\nIf your husband really was as defensive about it as you say, he might have some kind of problem with food too. Still, if he wanted some of the duck mousse and was ready to buy more to replace it, he should've just gone and bought some for himself. This actually sounds like bullying. Taking your things without asking and throwing fits when he gets denied it.", "NTA, you're not telling him what he can and can't eat, you're just buying small treats for yourself to look forward to which is a normal small joy in life. You're even getting him his own food that he likes so he's certainly not going hungry. My partner and I don't have kids but we buy food to share and food we'd like to eat ourselves, and just let the other know (or ask before we eat something we're not sure about) and it works perfectly well. Does he do the food shopping, or do you do it all yourself? I feel like that plays a part too.", "The real point is that he doesn't share. \nHe takes it all.\nThat's mean. \nI didn't grow up destitute, and I would still be upset.", "For the record, we are French and we live in France, witch explain the duck mousse and the moricette \ud83d\ude05", "INFO: would you be OK if he ate half and left you half?

We totally have reserved food (for up to 6 days, on the 7th is fair game as I am about to go to the store again.", "NTA - And you can clearly ignore the very disturbing Y T A included, one has to be quite fucked up to think that you shouldn't be able to own food for yourself.

Does it have a note on it, is it on an agreed shelf, or what? Has he agreed to _never_ eat anything from the fridge without asking first? How much of this is pre-agreed?\n\nI agree with the commenters who say that you both likely have low-key food issues, but you need to communicate and compromise and get everyone some: I'd get pissed off too if I discovered that there was \"treats for you and you, but none for me\" only when it was in my hand.  Everyone should get some.\n\nI'd also get pissed off too if I went to get the treats to find that it had been all finished and my partner was saying \"lol too slow\".  Your husband is TA if he takes it all. He's not a bachelor, he is a grown man with a wife and kid, who should consider them as well. Everyone should get some.\n\nAnd I'd be pissed if a special ingredient for everyone's supper got eaten by 1 person in the afternoon. if that happened, both parties failed to communicate.", "NTA, I totally get this. \n\nI didn't live with food insecurity (we were lower middle-class, but dad worked in restaurants, so...), but I, too, like my special treats! I have a particular cabinet where I stash shelf-stable treats (like chocolates), and my family respects it. They will ask if they can have some, but don't take without asking, which I appreciate.\n\nTry to explain yourself calmly, I suppose. I don't have any proper advice for you.

If he wants to buy more than he should go to the store and buy some instead of eating yours.", "INFO: what is the timeline here with things being kept aside, when he eats them, and when you find out they are gone?\n\nIf you keep things aside for a month.. that seems a bit much and is easily fixable by buying more.

He eats all his treats then thinks he\u2019s entitled to mine because his have gone. He also uses things until they have gone rather than save some for others. For example I\u2019ll buy 6 2L bottles of lemonade a month and he just chugs them until they are gone. I like a drink now and again, so every time I fancy a drink I go to the fridge and it\u2019s all gone.

I sympathise with you.", "Are you communicating with your husband that you bought something that he needs to stay away from?  If you're not communicating with him, that's on you.  In my household, I (husband) do most of the grocery shopping, and my wife picks up odds and ends of things she enjoys on occasion.  I don't touch her stuff without asking since I buy what I want and we need.  If we go out to eat and there are leftovers we bring home, we ask before eating the other person's food.  It's about respect that is based on communication.  If you don't tell your husband to leave the duck mousse alone, you can't expect it to be there when you're ready to eat it.", "INFO: why don't you buy a second portion of each special treat for your husband and then label them?", "A lot of people are posting the same comments about my post so I need to clarify : When I buy food it's for everyone and I buy special treats for my daughter, my husband and me. I don't mind if he eats wathever is on the fridge, I just wants him to say : I eat all of it so you need to buy more (or simply write it on the shopping bord) or ask if it's ok. He knows the duck mousse is for me because it's not the first time... When I buy more duck mousse he doesn't eat it (coincidence ?!?) So I don't know what to do... I shared the idea of personnal boxes on the fridge and he is not okay with spending money on that. My last shot is to force him to write on the bord otherwise I'm lost...", "NAH. I don't think your husband is a full-blown asshole for eating your snacks but your \"I used to be poor so I'll buy food now to eat in 5 weeks\" attitude is also encroaching on asshole territory. I get having a food-based trauma but you're a full-blown adult who can afford foie gras, so you need to stop hiding behind your past issues. Eating someone elses snacks IS taboo though, and you \\[at minimum\\] should label your snacks and tell your husband to not devour them, but this whole \"I can't share\" bit is weird.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t even matter what your respective pasts with food scarcity and snack control are - your husband is eating your snacks and food, without your permission, without replacing them, and without apology. That\u2019s extremely selfish behaviour.", "INFO: Have you tried creating a designated spot in the fridge/pantry for the items you're saving? Like a bin labled \"OP's treats\" or something like that? \n\nIf not, it might help avoid this issue in the future. If your husband isn't doing this on purpose, then having a designated spot for your stuff might help him avoid it. As frustrating as it is to have stuff you were saving eaten before you can get it (trust me, i know- I'm also a \"save/savor\" person whose partner is an \"eat right away\" person), i imagine it's also incredibly frustrating to have food you were just about to eat snatched away from you. I think if he's willing to work with you on a system (whether that's a specific spot for food he leaves alone or just checking in before eating stuff), then it's N A H. If he's not willing to work with you on this, then i think it's N T A. It's not unreasonable to want to have a few items of food set aside for specific uses or individual treats.", "INFO: How is he supposed to know what he\u2019s allowed to eat if you do all the shopping?", "NTA.\n\nSide-eyeing some comments though.", "NAH\n\nI understand where you're coming from but it sounds to me like maaaaaybe you're not communicating effectively? \n\nThe rule in my house is that if you think someone is saving something, ASK THEM before you eat it. Like, don't eat the last cookie without asking if someone else was saving it. And if you buy something for yourself that is a treat or something you're really looking forward to, express that to him. \"Hey, I bought this solid-gold truffle Cheez Whiz so I can eat it while watching TV later, can you leave it alone for me? If you want some, I'll get you some, but this is something I'm really looking forward to,\"\n\nAs with 98% of the relationship posts in this sub, it's probably ineffective communication so start there and see what happens.", "\u201cI can just replace it\u201d is what every food-thief says, usually to the person who actually does the grocery shopping \ud83d\ude02 He also could have gone out and bought it in the first place if he wanted it, but he didn\u2019t, you did. He\u2019s being rude.", "ESH\n\nFor the sole reason you are arguing about this for years instead of just solving it. \n\nPut a box in the fridge and pantry for each of you with your names on it and everything thats in these boxes are \"private property\", everything else can be eaten. You will benefit from this too as soon your kids get old enough to buy stuff themselfs, so dad is not eating away their treats. Also it will make clear to your husband that if he wants special stuff in his box, he has to buy it or putting it on the grocery list. \n\nMy cousin once bought a huge cake for herself (at 17/18) and put it in the fridge with her name on it. She had to save for a few weeks to get the cake bc it was so expensive. Her dad ate a good chunk of it bc like your husband his stance was \"what I find in MY fridge, i will eat if i'm in the mood and even if i hadn't paid for it or it doesn't belong to me, you need to share with me\". Well, my cousin was so pissed, got in a screaming match with him and then stopped talking to him completly. She looked for a shared apartment, moved out a few weeks later and till this day - over 10 yrs later - refuses to talk to her dad or even acknowledge him at family gatherings bc he still hasn't apologised. No doubt where she got her stubbornness from, lol. But bottom line, this uncle by marriage lost his relationship with his daughter over being greedy and petty (he even confirmed he doesn't like sweets, he ate it to make clear whos the boss in the house and to teach her how to share). The funny thing is, if HE got himself a special treat, dare you if you even looked at it. So it was just a power thing for him. And i guess thats the same for your husband - he is doing this to make clear who the boss is in the family, why else would he do it if he knows you, the person he loves, is sad or disappointed afterwards.", "NTA! You are a product of your upbringing/circumstances. I'm so sorry that you had to go through this. Your husband really needs to learn some self control. It's perfectly acceptable for each of you to have food that you've gotten for yourself only. He needs to learn this.", "Gently, YTA here. But just a little. \n\nIf you just returned from groceries and you bought the duck mousse as a backup plan for future time when you don't feel like cooking - why not let your husband eat it now and just buy more the next time you are at the groceries (or better, tell him to put it on his shopping list). \n\nIf you are together for 10 years, your partner probably is aware of this behavior of yours but he can't read your mind about what plans you have for certain food you have bought - especially when it isn't specific plans (\"I'll cook this on Tuesday when the in-laws are coming\") but it is a vague future plan. Communicate better and learn to differentiate when a food is planned or not. Maybe if you put postits on all the foods that you are squirreling away you might get a different perspective what is actually available for your husband to eat or it will give him a better idea what he shouldn't eat.", "YTA\n\nIf there isn't enough for everyone then there isn't enough purchased/made\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't treat your husband like a second class citizen by limiting what foods he is allowed to eat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you must have specific food for yourself then don't put them in communal places.", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe all the people calling you TA. Both my brother and I grew up the kind of people who liked to save their favorite stuff for last (to the point we once got an ant infestation due to my brother\u2019s uneaten Halloween candy) and after I ate his (very old) Easter bunny we came up with the policy of \u201cif it\u2019s here for X amount of time and it\u2019s still uneaten then it\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to try and save your special food for at least a little while, and you\u2019re allowed to be upset that he *always* eats your special snacks. You keep having this conversation with him and he\u2019s not changing his behavior. He\u2019s inconsiderate at best\u2014 and I would recommend asking yourself if he does other similar things (not listening to you when you raise a concern with his behavior and then blowing up when it\u2019s addressed) to see if it\u2019s some sort of pattern of behavior.", "growing up poor, that's your trauma. not his. asking to be left some is totally fine but saying flat out some groceries are not for him is weird and kinda rude. its also weird you don't just buy enough of something for all 3 of you to enjoy it.\n\nduck mousse is a high end treat A+, cold meat and cheese is B to B+, why is he getting a less exciting treat than you?\n\nwhen I go shopping I buy enough for my wife, daughter and I to enjoy something. if my wife doesn't like something I wouldn't but that's the only reason I wouldn't include her in a food purchase.\n\nnot going to call you an asshole but you could probably just adjust your purchases and or have a normal talk with your hubby.", "NTA. Even if there wasn't a perfectly understandable reason, it's not that hard to respect your partner's wishes and possessions, simply out of love, if anything else. My partner's kinda like you due to autistic reasons, and while I appreciate when she decides to share with me, I've made clear she doesn't have to, and I wouldn't touch anything of hers without at least asking beforehand, just because, you know, I love her and know that's important for her.\nAlso, I come from a home where there's a whole motto about food having no label, in the name of being sharing and selfless, but let me tell you, that's not the way the idea ends up being used a lot of the times. Every now and then, my parents would get four treats for the four of us siblings, and sometimes I'd save mine for later for whatever reason, only to find it gone when I looked for it. Even to this day it happens when I visit, and even to this day I get mocked for hoping any different. On the name of being sharing, one of my siblings would get two treats, and I'd get none. Ironic much?", "Idk, NTA, but its food not some unique possession. When i grew up it was eat whatever you want (we had 99% healthy things), but you don't use whatever the person cooking planned on using for dinner. We get the groceries delivered 3x a week now, so we just add something to the list if someone used something. Tell your husband in advance if hes not allowed to eat something specific. Telling someone beforehand helps.", "NTA. Ignoring the whole growing up poor thing (me too) eating something that you know someone wants to have later is just rude as f^ck. \n\nHe needs to be taught that not everything belongs to him just because he sees it, like a toddler. His mom obviously fell down on the job.", "ESH, you both clearly have issues to work out. Get off reddit and get therapy.", "Get a small fridge and lock it, yes \"as a family you have to share\" but you also have to respect if things are not yours or if you're specifically told \"don't eat it\" NTA but your husband is", "NTA. Your husband doesn't actually believe in sharing. He only believes that you need to share everything with him while he can take everything.", "Info: how is your husband supposed to know that you're saving something? Is it labeled?\n\nHonestly YTA. You have some trauma and you need to deal with it instead of using it as an excuse. I say this as someone with childhood trauma that occasionally interferes with my marriage. You are not starving anymore. Food is meant to be eaten.  Your possessiveness is not healthy or normal. It's one thing to have a candy bar stashed away for later, but it sounds like your husband has all sorts of restrictions in his own pantry. If you're so insistent on having your stash, label it carefully and buy extra that your husband and family can have. \n\nYour family shouldn't have to tip toe around because of your past. You need to deal with it.\n\nETA: you specifically told your husband that the food you bought is not for him. Do you realize how that sounds? I grew up with a mom like you and even though we always had food, I was often hungry because I wasn't allowed to eat anything. You're creating food scarcity in your own home.", "Honestly, NTA. I\u2019ve stopped buying certain foods on purpose because, yes it\u2019s for us to share, but I\u2019ll eat something when I\u2019m ready\u2026my bf will just devour it entirely and leave me a few bites at which point it\u2019s not appetizing anymore, it\u2019s just eating someone\u2019s leftovers.", "NTA. \nEven my daughters understand that I buy treats for myself and they stay away from it. He could have gone to get some for himself if it was such an issue.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a clear imbalance here. When your husband is the kind of person that always (or most of the time ) finishes his treats right away but isn't really distraught when he doesn't have any treats, he will always win when you play by his rules, especially when he isn't tempering himself so that you can enjoy some stuff.\n\nHe looks into the cupboard/fridge and sees something he likes, he claims it. You have no way to claim it for yourself other than eating it before he does, so you'll have to treat treats on his terms, not your own terms. If you come home from doing the shopping and you only go again in 3 days, you have to eat it today if your husband eats it or you'll have to wait for the next shopping trip.\n\nPeople saying this is normal and Y T A for wanting to have treats on your terms may have a bit of a point in that there is no real middle ground here. Either you have to work around your husband's behaviour or he has to work around your preferences. But some restraint is not a bad thing and it won't hurt your husband to show some consideration, especially when he hasn't had to show consideration in that aspect at all.\n\nAlternatively, you could get two packs of whatever you're getting if your husband likes it, too. Then one will be for you and one will be for him and yours are off limits.", "ESH. I get why you feel that way about food, but it seems like you don't have the same money issues if you're buying higher end food. Are you explicit in telling him that you're saving something for yourself? How does he know what he can and can't have if you're not communicating that? You need to address your food issues, but he also needs to address his, because no, not everything has to be shared.\n\nIt's okay to keep something for yourself if you have communicated that that's what you're doing, if he's still eating things after you've said prior to him going to get something to eat that that item is for you, then that's an A move, but it also isn't unreasonable for him to see something that's been sitting in a cupboard for weeks and to then eat that item.\n\nIt seems like both of you have communication and food issues and it's going to take work to sort that out. He should start by doing grocery lists and coming shopping with you.", "Yta. Go to therapy.", "YTA.\n\nStop arguing, and start looking for solutions.  Stop giving him crap, and start asking him to help.\n\n\"Babe, you know I grew up in a house that didn't always have food.  So I want to squirrel food away, just for myself.

My husband took out the duck mousse to eat, when I kindly told him that it wasn't for him because I was leaving it aside for later but that in return I had bought him some cheese and cold meats \n\nBut according to this, the actual issue is that you want specific food, and for him to eat other food that you don't consider as 'good.'\n\nEither get duck mousse for him too, if he likes it, or fucking talk to him about it ahead of time.  \"Hey, kiddo and I are getting duck mousse and moricettes; can I get you something special?\"\n\nWhat you're doing right now is making a 'you' problem a 'him' problem.  'You' have food insecurity, so 'he' has to read your mind to know what is and isn't allowed to eat.

Families share the fridge and pantry, his expectation is really normal and yours is really territorial. So he ate your squirreled away item- really so what? Buy more.  Are you going hungry?  It would be one thing if you had limited food and he was depriving you or your daughter of nutrition altogether, but that doesn't sound like the case here.

I have this exact experience with my boyfriend. We just moved in together this year, and I like to stretch food while he has what he wants all at once. It happens often with popsicles at our house. He will help himself to 1 or 2 at a time each day, whereas I could let it stay in the freezer for weeks, waiting to be in the mood to eat one. We have argued over him having something I wanted, and he thinks that because I don't eat it fast enough, it means I don't actually want it, or he will tell me to let him ha e it and we will just buy more. This option doesn't feel right to me because I grew up poor, so just buying more wasn't an option, so I feel like he's being greedy to justify taking my share by spending more money.

The only way you could possibly not be wrong here is if you buy family sized portions and he ate all, by himself, every time.", "Yes, YTA. Buy enough to share FFS! If you can afford duck mousse and moricettes, you can certainly afford to buy a little extra so your husband can have some too.\n\nAlso: my father grew up poor. Very poor -- in Appalachia, during the Great Depression. He and *all* of his siblings would tell the same story about their parents not eating at mealtimes, saying they weren't hungry so there would be more food for the kids. That's how poor Dad's family was.\n\nI've **never once** seen my father behave in such an absurdly selfish way as you describe yourself doing.", "YTA.  You can always go buy more. And so can he.

I think your husband needs to be involved in grocery shopping. If you want a special snack, go for it, but see if he would also like that snack. If he does, get him one or some amount of it and that is his. If he\u2019s not grocery shopping, he doesn\u2019t have the same opportunity to pick snacks;however he is an adult. He can either get them himself or go with you. \n\nI get that though. If you tell someone it\u2019s your snack, it\u2019s rude to eat it. My rule is, if you know it isn\u2019t yours/you didn\u2019t request said snack, you gotta communicate via text or tell me that you\u2019re finishing the last of it. Then, based on whether or not I was hoping to eat it or I\u2019m okay with the loss, I\u2019ll either buy another on my way home (I work and go to school so I travel a bit every day and gas stations are mini grocery stores) or he will or we get it when one of us goes next time. We both grocery shop but we also buy for each other when we go because we talk about what we may or may not need. \n\nCommunication is key. Maybe set up a shelf for your special snacks and his. Buy an extra snack or two so he has some, but communicate one is saved for you as well or you and your daughter. Have him take a more active roll in the grocery shopping too. He can make his own list and then partake in the shopping as well. Sometimes it\u2019s just easier to go so you get to see in person what you may or may not want that week or so before the next trip.", "YTA.

However, this seems far more than that.  You buy food you like, and expect your husband never to touch \"your\" food.

You buying a chocolate bar or a pint of ice cream that is for you is one thing.  Buying food and saving it for days, weeks, or a month isn't that.

I grew up in the same conditions as you and also ended up with trauma which makes me always worry that there won't be enough food even if I have the means for it. Having a family member eat something I've been saving is distressing for me because of lacking food so much during childhood.   \n\n\nAt first it pissed off my partner because he (who grew up in a good environment with food on the table every day) because food is meant to be eaten and even if he offered to by more, at that instant I felt distressed. It took a while but after explaining my trauma and fear of not having food and squirreling away some of it for later we ended up being able to communicate better.  \n\n\nWhen I buy some food for later I will tell him so that he knows that he can eat anything else except that thing I'm saving and it's working well for us.

Of course food is meant to be eaten and it might be frustrating for your husband especially if he never had to scrounge for food as a little kid but you can make some type of compromise that you can have your little snack box or something that is off limit while still not making him feels like he's walking on eggshells when he's hungry. Good luck to the both of you :)", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to buy stuff that is just for you.

Just because he doesn't save stuff like you doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate it when he does eat it. Just as you find it frustrating to go to eat the nice thing and find it's already gone, it's not fair on him to not be able to eat the nice stuff now because you want to save it for yourself later. Why does he get the meat and cheese but you get the mousse?\n\nAlso, if you are saving things for a month then it's on you to communicate that effectively with the husband, it's not unreasonable for him to assume after some time that you don't want or have forgotten about that food. And you can't expect him to just remember which foods you said you are and aren't saving for that long a period of time.

Tell him that repeatedly taking food you've set aside despite being asked not to tells you that he doesn't love or respect you, and that what he's doing is emotionally abusive.

If I am told no, then I put it back and eat something else.\n\nThe fact that your husband got so defensive and didn't ask is so rude but also a cause for concern. If he wants to eat it so bad and can buy it himself, then he can damn well take his butt to the store and buy it for himself.

My husband thinks that food should be shared and most of the time, I manage to control myself to agree with him. The problem being that I'm like a little squirrel and I like to put the things I like aside so that they are still there when I want to eat them (even if it's a month later).He, for his part, eats whatever he likes almost at once, and generally when I come home thinking of eating the thing I had put aside, he has of course already devoured it... What follows next? an argument over always the same reason, I had put it aside and I really wanted to eat it, I don't think it's fair to always be frustrated at the moment when I'm looking forward to eating because you didn't know how to control yourself and leave me some...\nLast time was when I bought some duck mousse that I thought I would eat with moricettes with our daughter when I didn't feel like cooking. My husband took out the duck mousse to eat, when I kindly told him that it wasn't for him because I was leaving it aside for later but that in return I had bought him some cheese and cold meats . He of course immediately got angry, accusing me of appropriating the food and that it wasn't a tragedy if he ate it now and he could have bought more. I had just come back from shopping groceries...\nSo, AITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We used to fight so much about this until he finally understood how disrespected I felt by him. I don't come from a poor home, I simply hate when someone takes my things without asking, and his lack of planning for a nighttime snack is not my responsibility to rectify by giving up my snacks that I acquired for myself. He couldn't understand and kept reiterating that he wouldn't mind if it was the other way round. Which doesn't happen because I would never. We're just different in that regard. He had to understand that this was about me setting a boundary and him constantly stomping past it because he deemed it ridiculous. Once he finally understood how problematic that thinking was things got vehemently better. Now, when he eats my snacks, he sneaks to the store and replaces them within a few hours, but it happens very very seldomly these days.", "NTA.

Everyone deserves to have their little treats that they eat on their own schedule.", "I\u2019ve almost made my own post before about the phenomenon of women squirreling away treats in places like the vegetable bin. It is very common in generations of my family, if you bought a treat to be split, the husband always ate their share right away, and then would look at you moon eyed while you ate yours later. I\u2019ve seen it all around the world, just an interesting observation.", "Setting food aside is reasonable. His \"food is to be shared\" attitude in this context is just rationalizing his behavior. How is eating all of something sharing? And how does he justify eating something that was intended for his daughter? Is she being taught that this is ok behavior instead of asking and being mindful of others? \"He could get more\" But does he? And how is one supposed to meal plan when he doesn't respect that he can't just eat whatever is in the fridge? Even if the items have been squirreled away for a bit (and I'm hoping this are non-perishable items), he can do the adult thing and ASK if it's ok to eat it.  \n\n\nAll of this makes me think your husband has an unhealthy relationship with food or there is some other issue driving him to behave this way.

But for Christmas last year somebody bought me a Coravin, which means I can now decide \"I'd like to have a single glass of wine\" and can have one. This means that sometimes partial bottles will sit out in the kitchen, and they can be there for up to a month. There have been a couple of occasions where my partner has assumed I've forgotten about them and poured them away before I've finished drinking them (which is very fair, because I have ADHD and that sort of thing definitely happens). \n\nWe now have an agreement that if the Coravin stopper is in the bottle then she doesn't pour them away, though if it's been over a month she'll sometimes ask me whether I'm planning to finish it because as I mentioned, my memory for this stuff is really terrible. Sometimes that's all it takes.", "NTA, I've had exes who just didn't understand that couples still have separate possessions. I'm allowed to have things that are just mine.

If not it should be replaced before I have a chance to notice. \n\nMy counter point would be if I bought something special, but haven\u2019t touched it in a month then it can\u2019t be that special. Unless of-course it was a limited time item or something that tastes better with age.", "So he never actually replaces the food he eats then, right?", "Firmly NTA in that case. If he wants specific food he can request it from you or go buy it himself!", "NTA\n\nI am the person in your husband's position. My spouse does all the shopping and I eat what's available.\n\nI never eat something that I don't know its purpose for. If I am on a streak of eating bagels and there is a new bag of bagels I go ahead and eat them because I can safely assume they are for me. If a bag of chips and guacamole suddenly shows up, I ask my spouse what it is for before eating it. Did he want a snack for himself? Did he buy it for the office? Did he invite someone over for snacks? I have no idea *why* he bought it and so *I don't eat it* until he can tell me its purpose.\n\nI live with my spouse and a roommate. We share these food values (fortunately!!). Since I eat 90% of the bagels, my roommate wouldn't eat the last bagel because she knows it could interfere with my plans. My roommate eats 90% of the cereal. I am free to eat some cereal as long as I leave enough remaining for her to have one or two more servings so that she can safely adjust her shopping plans without inconveniencing her meal plans.\n\nWe also \"own\" our leftovers. Everyone gets first dibs on their leftovers. We personally *hate* food waste, so we added a household rule that people have a day to eat their leftovers before it's freely available. We say, \"If you saw it there yesterday, you can eat it today.\"\n\nFollowing that, yes, people can \"own\" specific food. They can earmark food for a specific purpose. You enjoying a specific snack with your child is a perfect example. My roommate frequently buys and makes food for the office. That food is off limits.\n\nThe goal here is that we can plan our meals, generally a day or two in advance. \n\nYour husband is being a huge AH. From my understanding, you two were unpacking the groceries and he decided to eat something right away without asking? First, it's rude to eat something you don't know the purpose of. Then when you tell him you reserved that food for a specific activity, and he gets pissed because... He thinks food should *never* be reserved for anything? Ever? That's outrageous. \n\nThese people who understand no concept of food reservation/ownership exist, we hear about them on AITA a lot, but it blows my mind. Food is a resource, and like any and every other resource, it is likely earmarked for some specific purpose. \n\nI hope you can get through to your husband that he can't just eat absolutely anything and everything in the house no matter what. 100% of food is not 100% communal. There are many relationships that have suffered from this strange thought process around food. They just can't stop themselves from eating anything they can get their hands on -- and throw fits if you lock it up!", "Do you buy all the food or use shared funds?", "I do most of our food shopping, and most of the cooking too. We don't have any history of food insecurity or anything, but it is *still* annoying to go to make dinner and realize -- hey, we *cannot* have pepperoni pizza because *someone* ate all of the pepperoni when he was feeling munchy one night. So I ensured everything that had a specific purpose was in specific parts of the refrigerator, freezer, and pantry. Stuff that was for anyone to eat was stored on other shelves. \n\nEating from the \"already have plans for it\" shelf is an AH move. Eating anything else is being an adult and feeding yourself or your kid. Leftovers are treated the same way -- if it's enough for everyone to have lunch tomorrow, it goes in the \"plans for it\" section. If there's only a little bit, it goes in the free-for-all section.", "He's physically unable to grocery shop?

That seems like the best option, if he wants to eat and you don't want to share.", "I know it is frustrating and you are NTA. He is NTA either though. He in his mind is a grown man capable of making his own decisions and has a right to eat whatever whenever. However, My mom and I have a rule that if you finish or eat something you are responsible for replacing it or informing the other we need to buy more to make it last for next time, maybe something like that forcing to hold him accountable to go shopping when he eats something and finishes it off not leaving anything.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, he should be doing half the shopping, and he should be responsible for making sure there are snacks/treats in the house.

I say this just to point out that different people have different opinions about and struggles with food, and it is nice if partners can discuss how and help each other in this area!", "Wanting to save something to enjoy later in the day is not disordered eating. And not wanting your food to be constantly eaten by someone else doesn't make you an asshole.", "OP was saving it as a *treat* for herself, which makes sense because of its higher-end status. Her husband just selfishly ate it all himself.", "It\u2019s not disordered. It\u2019s also clearly a necessary behavior if OP wants to get to anything good before he does.

There are things on this planet that are yours, and things that aren't.

Ownership doesn't change because of a timing of anything. \"This isn't yours\" is valid before purchase, after purchase and up until one decides to consume or share.\n\nIf you don't respect the person you love most on earth enough to let them own things, you are a disrespectful partner.", "I have no idea - with the specific example it seemed the dude just opened the fridge and saw food and OP said he couldnt eat it. \n\nHow would he know what he can and cant have?", "Of course you feel that.  But would you feel the same way if a wife was upset that a husband was buying special food for him and their son, but telling her she can't have any?", "Actually he doesn't usually eat duck mousse.

He just wake up and choose this on the fridge. \nIt's not the fact that he eat it. It's that I know he won't replace it or just won't tell me if he finished something, so I won't know if I have to buy more.\nAlso we don't live far away from the store so we could easily return if need it", "Thank you! I don't see why this isn't the answer. \n\nHonestly, as the husband, I would be irritated if I saw duck mousse that I thought was up for grabs and was told no you can't have that bc I'm saving it but I got you cheese and meat. \n\nBuy two. Once he eats his, yours is off limits.", "INFO: Yeah, I feel like the post is missing some specific info that could make this judgment easier, like...\n\n* How did they come to the agreement that OP does the shopping? If they work similar hours, then OP's husband could add some shopping to his routine. If OP is a SAHM or if OP's husband makes up for the lack of shopping in some other way, then I can understand him being frustrated with having arbitrary sections of his fridge \"off-limits.\"\n* Does OP have a history of letting food go bad? I was more like OP's husband in my childhood home, but, after I stopped eating leftovers after being guilted about it too much, I noticed our leftovers would go bad pretty often.  Maybe OP's husband has thrown out too much food that he's avoided because of her lengthy dibs.\n* How visible is \"off-limits\" food? If it's right in the center of the fridge and unlabeled, that's a little mean, but if she has a drawer of food that's just hers or labels things clearly, then that's probably fair.\n* How much food specifically is \"OP's\" at a given time? If it's a couple tupperwares, that's probably fine, but if a 1/4 of the fridge is reserved, then that's probably too much and can be gotten around by just using up what's there and buying more when it runs out.\n\nI really can see both sides of it. OP does her best to paint her husband as greedy, but we don't get a clear picture of how exactly her habits impact the family's food storage and daily life. Everyone probably hides something they want to save for themself at some point, but it can also be frustrating to open the fridge for a week and see your favorite food sitting there, untouched, but completely off-limits.

Or being told it's not for me and she'll eat it later, only to wait until it's past the expiry, moldy, and taking up space in the fridge for me to ask if she still wants to eat it. Then I'm still the AH for asking her to eat expired and moldy food. But I had found it frustrating that food was being bought, saved, and then left to spoil, only to be left as my chore to clean it up and discard it afterwards. I get so annoyed by it that I will wait until it's just past its expiry (a few days) and then ask if she wants it, she'll ask when it expired, I'll tell her, and she'll tell me no.

I lost it. \n\nI explained the issue with food - growing up poor, and how that sandwich was made especially for me at work by a chef who wanted me to try something from their culture. I was pissed and devastated because the ingredients were hard to obtain and I knew the chef would be disappointed, and I was disappointed and furious. \n\nCW was stunned.

CW apologized profusely and took me to hunt down the ingredients and paid for them in hopes that the chef could make it again - he said it was delicious.

There aren\u2019t any shaped Reese\u2019s summer holidays though so I have to lay in a stash during winter holiday or Easter sales to last me until Halloween shapes come out again.", "Yes, it's worth a try.", "I\u2019ve been with my spouse for 22 years and we share everything. I\u2019m not territorial over food and I grew up food poor also. I guess some people share and others are hoarders \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Because it was special. Only for her and her daughter ... She doesn't want him to have any.", "Not really. Based on what OP said they cost, doesn't sound much more expensive either. The price of jif or natural PB is way more than what she spent on duck mousse.", "Nah, then OP won't get anything she likes; it'll all be for him.", "Because family food is for the family. \n\nOP has not said hi she indicates that something shouldn\u2019t be eager other than stopping him once he takes it out to eat it. Nor has she said how many items this applies to. \n\nShe could be controlling his food access to an unhealthy extent.", "I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re justifying it or saying she\u2019s being unreasonable. It seems silly to buy a $2 item and bogart it vs just buying 2-3 $2 items.", "I hate it because I'm one of the people who doesn't like pizza. Never liked it, even as a kid. Birthdays, class parties, sleep overs, etc were tough. At least I usually got extra cupcakes", "I was just about to post those last 2 lines...a simple \"Hey, I was going to heat up the left overs, would you like some?\" Simple and considerate. \nI mainly will cook as I have specific dietary needs, but dayum...I feel like it's such an easy fix!!", "I mean\u2026 he took out the duck and you said \u201cyou can\u2019t eat that, that\u2019s mine.\u201d  Maybe he\u2019s tired of not feeling like things in his house are his? How often do you tell him He can\u2019t eat something?", "Especially knowing he would like it too. I mean this is her husband, not her roommate. I\u2019d be so sad if my husband came home with a treat for himself and purposefully didn\u2019t get me one and wouldn\u2019t offer me a bite. He always gets two chocolate bars", "Exactly what i meant. Should've added sarcasm indicator.", "God that sounds exhausting. You deserve so much better than that."]}
