But it sounds like your wife is in rough shape, being kind wouldn't hurt you.", "It seems to me that this has an obvious solution - get more fries lol. NTA, but, \u201choney, I\u2019ll happily go get you some more fries\u201d would probably have gone a long way.", "NTA", "NTA in theory, but you definitely should try and empathize with her. I can imagine she's in a very tough space right now. Do something nice for her! She deserves to be treated special just like everyone else!", "Listen carefully OP - this is not about the fries. Your wife has just told you that she feels like she is constantly giving to you and your toddler and the one time she asked you for something small, you refused. People often reach their breaking point over the stupidest things, in this case, some reheated chips.\n\nPeople are all impressed by grand gestures but the reality is, it is the small gestures of affection every day that make a marriage strong. Picking up her favourite chocolate bar from the petrol statiom on the way home from work. Making her a cup of coffee in the morning when you get up. If you are sitting on the couch together watching tv, give her quick foot massage while you watch. Verbally tell her you have noticed how hard she works looking after the toddler and yourself, and you appreciate it. Try to do one nice small thing for your wife every day. Not big or elaborate one off gestures. Just something small that shows you are thinking about her and appreciate her every day. Your marriage will be the stronger for it.\n\nI am going to say NAH but you need to read between the lines and focus less on the KFC.", "NTA if you originally just got fries for yourself and didn't share that would be a different story, but when we ask someone a question we should always be prepared that the answer may not be the one we want. I know it's really hard and tiring being mum to a baby and toddler, so maybe you could make sure she has the odd special thing or treat just for her as it can be really draining constantly giving yourself to others, and she'll feel like she's appreciated.", "Nta just buy more fries. Yall obviously like them alot.", "NTA, and it sounds likes she\u2019s upset at how you said it more than what you said. \n\nBut tbh would it have really hurt to just share them?", "My partner and I always respect each's left overs.  And only eat our own. \n\nToddlers on the other hand...... they have no respect for what is ours and what is theirs.  If she wants more of the food she shares with your toddler, she should either cook more or buy more.", "She's breastfeeding.\nNothing but fries sounds good.\nShe's hungry.\nYou have fries.\nYou don't share your fries with your hungry breastfeeding wife.\n\nYTA.", "NAH. She asked, you answered, and then you carried on a reasonable adult discussion after. That being said, sounds like she sees herself as making a lot of sacrifices for the kids, so make sure you do a little extra to show your appreciation.", "YTA. To be clear, you did not share your fries, you SPLIT the fries.\n\nYou\u2019re sitting there enjoying other foods that your wife does not want, she asks to have some of your fries, and it seems like you didn\u2019t even consider it. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a question of fairness, it\u2019s about consideration for her. And it seems like you didn\u2019t give two shits what your wife had to eat because she already had 50.0% of the fries at the meal.", "YTA because of the part about the tone. You admit it was unsurprising she was shocked and hurt.\n\nIt's not about the fries, moreso just give and take in general. You were shocked when she asked, so she must not ask often and shut it down immediately. It sounds like she is often being asked of others and usually says yes.", "I must be crazy but am I the only one who read this as  his wife wanted his food as an act of sacrifice. No matter how much he buys she wants him to give up his whatever she decides to balance her sacrificing for their kids! Maybe your wife needs to speak with someone about that", "NTA, but your wife is nursing and will probably need a lot of extra special TLC for a time. You weren't in the wrong for eating your fries, but perhaps you could have been more in the right by sharing them.\n\nMarriage isn't necessarily about being fair and even in everything. It's about both parties striving to give more than they get. Kindness > justice sort of thing.", "NTA but unfortunately this is going to be one of those moments that leave a smear on the relationship.", "YTA, It\u2019s just fries, and it\u2019s your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With the baby and toddler are you maybe feeling like you there is no time/nothing that's just yours and this was just a silly little thing to say no to?  If so, she is obviously feeling the same and you need to work out how to be 'both of you and yourselves' as well as kid taking care machines.", "NAH sounds like it\u2019s not about the fries.

It\u2019s fries are you okay", "YTA, holy cow, it\u2019s just fries for goodness sake.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the ambrosia of the gods, share it with her.

He put heart out of whipped cream on my pancake just yesterday. He cleans my special coffee mug if it's not clean before making me coffee.

The wife is the one who doesnt want to share", "Yes \u201cher share\u201d, OP bought fries for both of them, she had more than half of them, because she\u2019s breastfeeding OP should just expect to not have any of the food both of them like, if she wants it all, oh well, OP should just suck it up?"]}
