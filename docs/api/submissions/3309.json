The past two years my mom has come with her boyfriend, now fiance, Leo. I don't know Leo too well as he doesn't really engage, but the first year my mom came in with a huge bag and was acting really weird and secretive. When we sat down to eat, I noticed that Leo's food looked slightly different from ours. I saw my wife giving it funny looks as well and I asked. At first they tried to lie. Then my mom admitted that she had snuck Leo food from home. I didn't let it go and wanted an answer. She finally admitted that he hates our food and she wanted him to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI was pissed but waited to take her aside. She was told to never do that again. This year she brought Leo again. Neither ate much and they only stayed a little over an hour. When I confronted my mom she admitted that she was going home to have another dinner with Leo and some friends, because she feels so guilty knowing he is willing to spend his whole holiday doing something that makes him miserable for her sake.\n\nMy wife called her a pick me. My mom didn't know what that was, so that was an interesting conversation. My mom finally admitted Leo grew up very poor and that is why he hates our food so much, because it reminds him of his mother's cooking. I don't even know what the fuck that meant, but I could see my wife's blood was boiling so I told my mom she isn't allowed to come back with Leo. She said who spends the holidays without their partner, but I said she had to chose between the two of us. I ended up banning her and she called me an asshole and the whole family is furious with me. They say I'm being irrational and should just ignore it because he makes her really happy.

Beyond that she\u2019s done nothing to warrant being banned from your Thanksgiving. You should have let it go instead of embarrassing them. \n\nThe irony of your wife calling your mother a \u2018pick me\u2019, when she\u2019s essentially caused you to pick her over your mother\u2026.", "YTA you oy are mad because he doesn't like the food?  Why can't he bring something in a subtle manner that he did so he can eat to?  They didn't make a scene about it you and your wife did.  Maybe just maybe your wife's cooking sucks.  Thanksgiving isn't about dictatorship it's about being with the family.", "Info: Would OP be as upset if Mom and Leo brought food because of an allergy or other health-related dietary restriction? Just asking to see what the wife's reaction would be.", "YTA.\n\nI read your comments and your wife\u2019s a clearly a bad cook. She should realize that and be more creative with her hosting - do a potluck and focus on being the hosts vs the cook. Or she could learn how to cook better. \n\nIt is possible to improve one\u2019s cooking skills but it\u2019s quite hard to come back from ending your relationship with your mom over pre-made stuffing.", "INFO: be honest\u2014is your wife a good cook?", "YTA. Apologize, and then suggest maybe switching up holidays to host. Thanksgiving is all about food. Christmas and Easter, not so much. You say your wife is a mediocre cook--then let her take one of the simpler holiday meals, or coordinate with other family members to bring certain dishes. And get your wife some cooking lessons.", "This feels like the MIL troll\u2026..", "NAH (or everyone is)\n\n\nI am unsure if your mom meant anything by it.  It sounds like y'all have a strained relationship at baseline.  She could have communicated better that she would be bringing food for them.   Maybe you guys could start hanging out and doing activities not food centered.", "NTA. Your mom's boyfriend is rude. It's just ridiculous to not eat the food that is served because it reminds him of being poor. Give me a break.", "NTA\n\nDude, what the fuck? I cannot *believe* all the YTA responses in here. Are you *kidding me?*\n\nThis chud rocks up sneaking in his own food to thanksgiving. Why? Does he have a dietary restriction? No. Is he vegan or something? No.\n\nHe says the hosts wife\u2019s cooking is *too poor and low class for him!!!*\n\nAm I taking crazy pills here? How on earth is that NOT the most douchey thing that jerk could have possibly said about a massive home cooked meal the host\u2019s wife slaves over all day to provide?!\n\nI don\u2019t care if it tastes like literal chef boyardee, you fuckin eat it, you fuckin smile, and you say fuckin THANK YOU.", ">If your only problem with Leo is that he will not eat your food, then let him eat the food he brings. \n\nOr express some interest in Leo, find out what he DOES like for Thanksgiving, and have a dish or two that he would like.", "My mom always cooked dinner at home if we went to non family for the holidays.  Mostly, it was so we had leftovers.  But one Thanksgiving we visited a family friend.  Everything was either overcooked or undercooked. We just didn't advertise the at home dinner.", "No, OP made it a problem his mother did not", "He claims the instant stuff tastes cheap and like what he had to eat as a kid", "That's what I'm saying! They're too nice to say the food sucks. If the OP and his wife want to host so badly, they should actually focus on keeping their guests happy.", "He ate their once and apparently told my mom he never wanted to again and that our \"air feels stick\" lol we are too middle class for him", "no", "Mediocre, it isn't bad but it isn't as good as my mom's homemade versions", "No way you are this oblivious. Can you explain why you think no one touches your wife's food? Do not say it's because your mom \"takes over everything\" because that doesn't make sense. Seriously, why do you think no one touches your wife's food?", "Not you banning other food cause your wife's food isn't good \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dYTA", "Ouch! I can see how that would hurt. My feelings would be really hurt if that happened to me. It also sounds like your mom is in some sort of competition against your wife using holidays to outcook your wife instead of letting your wife have the spotlight and making her feel inadequate.  That is not ok. That said, I think banning her and odd boyfriend (I mean, seriously, what middle aged man or older sits around playing with his girlfriend's hair instead of engaging with the company?) from holidays is extreme. Myself, I would quit hosting,  but you said it is important to your wife. Would a decent compromise be that you invite mom and boyfriend to come after dinner for coffee and visiting? Maybe taking the food element out of it might decrease tensions. NTA", "Sounds like your wife SHOULD let others cook", "I think there's more to this story than OP is letting on.", "Do you ever ask him what he's interested in?", "Hi mil troll is food a part of your weird fetish?", "He has a point there. Instant stuff tastes cheap and is loaded with sodium and chemicals. Some of it barely qualifies as food.  Maybe your wife needs to learn to make holiday meals from scratch--or ask your mom and Leo to make some dishes and bring them--that would be a lot easier on her anyway.", "So was he raised in a poor family and is now wealthy, so he looks down on people because of their food? My dad and my father-in-law grew up in the same small town..Both families were poor--their dads were coal miners. My father LOVED the food his mother made, and we had it at home often. Things like beans and collards with cornbread, etc. My FIL HATED that kind of food and was a real snob about it. So which is Leo like?", "My moms just tastes better, but that does not mean that my wife's is awful or that she doesn't ever deserve a chance to host", "I've had rice with butter along with a cup of coffee. Is that kinda the same?? Seriously being poor taught me A LOT. In several ways I am thankful for it.\n\nI agree with the improper communication, at this point I think all that's missing is a genuine non butt hurt conversation", "I don't see why i should bend over backwards", "So you think that telling OP's wife her food sucks before the holiday would have been better? It would avoid arguments? How can the wife fix the problem if they won't allow anyone to bring food and she's making an entire Thanksgiving dinner alone, mostly out of a box? I think the mom handled it as best she could. Leaving to eat somewhere else is probably the best compromise, since they can't bring anything they like.", "Info:  is your wife a good coke? Does she under season? Is the meal \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018simple\u2019? \nCould it be that it\u2019s not as enjoyable for everyone if they would rather eat the stuff your mom brings? \nI think that having a variety should be a good thing when it comes to a big family meal.", "If she\u2019s going to insist on hosting, she should improve. Why does she even *want* to serve people the sub-par version of things?", "You AND your wife don't know how to host though. What host purposefully causes issues when guests bring food over, especially when it's your mom? That's a very normal thing to do, the fact that you and your wife don't understand that is inexcusable. You don't deserve any right to host Thanksgiving when you make no effort to accommodate your guests or cook a decent meal. You can YouTube this stuff. Or just order out. Your excuses hold no water, it's a pride thing for your wife. You guys put so much more effort into being antagonistic assholes than into learning how to cook or pick up a phone or just being good hosts. Do yourself and your wife a favor and apologize to your mother or else you won't be hosting anything for a long time. She already uninvited you to the wedding. It's all downhill from here now unless you do something about it.\n\nETA: Also why not just let your mother do the cooking and bring it over to your house? Do the dishes as a thank you and this issue is resolved full stop.", "She is a mediocre cook. She does rely on some pre-made instant things which my mom's homemade versions are objectively better", "As someone who also grew up very poor, it\u2019s a struggle to eat those things. It just brings up bad memories and it can really put a damper on your celebrations. \nCould a compromise be to do it more \u2018pot luck\u2019 style? Why should anyone have to eat things that are less enjoyable?", "Let me get this straight: your mom is objectively a better cook, who makes homemade meals that everyone loves. Your wife is a mediocre cook who uses processed crap. You invited people over for Thanksgiving to give your wife a chance to host, but you're not allowing your guests to bring food they would actually enjoy. Now you're surprised that they want to leave early and enjoy dinner somewhere else. When you're hosting a holiday as big as thanksgiving, or any other party, it is your job to make sure your guests are happy. Obviously they don't like your wife's cooking, and they're too nice to say it out loud.
