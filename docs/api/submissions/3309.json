The past two years my mom has come with her boyfriend, now fiance, Leo. I don't know Leo too well as he doesn't really engage, but the first year my mom came in with a huge bag and was acting really weird and secretive. When we sat down to eat, I noticed that Leo's food looked slightly different from ours. I saw my wife giving it funny looks as well and I asked. At first they tried to lie. Then my mom admitted that she had snuck Leo food from home. I didn't let it go and wanted an answer. She finally admitted that he hates our food and she wanted him to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI was pissed but waited to take her aside. She was told to never do that again. This year she brought Leo again. Neither ate much and they only stayed a little over an hour. When I confronted my mom she admitted that she was going home to have another dinner with Leo and some friends, because she feels so guilty knowing he is willing to spend his whole holiday doing something that makes him miserable for her sake.\n\nMy wife called her a pick me. My mom didn't know what that was, so that was an interesting conversation. My mom finally admitted Leo grew up very poor and that is why he hates our food so much, because it reminds him of his mother's cooking. I don't even know what the fuck that meant, but I could see my wife's blood was boiling so I told my mom she isn't allowed to come back with Leo. She said who spends the holidays without their partner, but I said she had to chose between the two of us. I ended up banning her and she called me an asshole and the whole family is furious with me. They say I'm being irrational and should just ignore it because he makes her really happy.

You could also ask your mother what kind of person has that attitude towards the family of the person they are supposed to love? You could also ask her why she is making excuses for him, rather than him being adult enough not speak for himself.\n\nYou also mentioned Leo doesn\u2019t engage, so he\u2019s a coward who is allowing your mother to \u201cmother\u201d him Re food via secrecy while also not giving the basic respect of getting to know the family or being honest with you if he truly has some food issue. I was a fussy eater as a kid and this is what my mother often did for me, but I was like 7 and she probably shouldn\u2019t have been doing that then. But Leo is an adult, it\u2019s so incredibly pathetic. \n\nIf I were you I would cool the entire argument down, resume a pleasant disposition and say \u201cwe\u2019d love to see you mom but we certainly don\u2019t want to be the cause of Leo\u2019s misery.\u201d Hopefully your mom has a think about the fact that her new partner finds spending time with her family to be \u201cmiserable\u201d and is willing to insult you all.
