And why the hell would need to communicate that fact she wants to see her bf after she has had surgery. Imagine having a bf and having to tell him this. And I am pretty sure there more to the story than just this.", "ESH - she is overreacting with her texts, but you don\u2019t need to be a mind reader to know she would want your support. In fact you did think of it before you went to the gym, but you wanted to go to the gym so you rationalized it in your mind. \n\nIn a healthy relationship you shouldn\u2019t need to ask for every little thing.

Or at least if not the AH, kind of inconsiderate. She had a painful procedure and it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to skip the gym for one day and check in on her. I don\u2019t think not living with her makes a difference, you can still go by and see how she is, ask if she needs anything. You\u2019re supposed to love this person, so they have to spell out every time they need some care from you?\n\nHowever, I may be biased.

She had a surgery (small but still) You could have at least gone there and talked to her a little, given her some of your attention and then gone to the gym, no? I believe there are things people shouldn't have to ask for when they are in relationships, she can't ask you \"Hey, come here, take care of me!\" I think you lacked a little sensitivity, but I understand that her reaction was exaggerated, you guys need to have a talk.", "ESH.

It would be nice if a partner stopped using that as excuse that because she didn't ask, he didn't know. The fact is, he didn't give a flip, and because she didn't ask, he didn't feel obliged, and didn't feel like being there for supposedly his loved one, during painful time, literally really painful time. Painkillers only do so much. It costs nothing to care and to offer emotional support. Fact is, HE DIDN'T WANT TO so he didn't even think of it.\n\nThats why YTA. If she has to ask for something this basic, what kinda relationship is that? Its not like asking for someone to go to store to grab something. This is basic relationship thing.", "NTA, it feels like it escalated pretty quickly. \n\nIf anything, it's a good way for her to learn how to communicate her feelings: if she was bored and wanted to see you, she could have asked you to come over. When you didn't offer, she immediately assumed it was out of disinterest for her, while, on your side, you assumed she didn't want you to.\n\nYes, you could have offered just to check, but it still didn't warrant such an aggressive last response on her side.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot read her mind, and know her pain. I am for example capable of distracting myself even though I live with my GF. Different people have different needs. Maybe you could ask, but her reaction is selfish and definitely overreacting.\n\nBtw when they pulled my wisdom teeth, after anesthetics went off I didn't feel any pain. It was an easy, nice painless procedure so it can also be different per person. \n\nDon't assume, ask. Both of you :)", "ESH. She was rude. You should have cared about her surgery.", "NTA.\n\nHer texts are an unpleasant combination of passive aggressive and openly aggressive rudeness.

Hopefully she has an apology ready for you when she comes off the drugs and sees your correspondence back and forth. She was out of line.\n\nAlso, if she really wanted you to come over after work, she should have COMMUNICATED that.  It seems like you would have been willing to do so to make her happy.

She got her wisdom teeth out, it\u2019s a minor procedure.  She sounds selfish and entitled.  \n\nI literally had my last two removed this summer (both impacted), and while it wasn\u2019t fun, it was no excuse to act like a victim and lash out at those around me.  \n\nTell her to take some Tylenol, take a nap, and if she stops treating you like an iPad (existing solely for her amusement) bring her some ice cream lol", "NTA \n\nA three hour round trip just for basic, universal surgery is unnecessary. getting wisdom teeth out SUCKS, but you don\u2019t need \u201cdistractions\u201d from it and its definitely not an excuse to use such harsh language towards a partner. tell her to ice her face and get over it", "I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s a 3 hour round trip after a long work day for an 18 yo?

The recovery is painless, just awkward feeling with the gauze and sensations. NTA", "NTA- she was expecting you to do something without being actually telling you what she needed/wanted. That is bizarre. How are you to read her mind. If you had both discussed you coming afterwards previously and you decided to bail or something I can see her reaction being warranted however this chick needs to learn to communicate. \n\nShe lives 1.5 hours away and just casually thought you would drive 3 hours so you can watch her sleep. I slept the first day after my wisdom teeth removal because of the drugs. \n\nI highly suggest she read the book Non-Violent Communication. It tells you to express a feeling and a need. Quite simple really.  She did neither. She chose violence today.", "NTA. Sure, I can grant that her wanting you to comfort her is something I can see her not thinking she'd need to ask. I'm inclined to say her reaction is due to to pain and possibly more about her mom than you, but even if that's the case she shouldn't have talked to you that way. \n\n\nYou're not a mind reader, and you did what you thought would be best because you weren't told otherwise by her. \n\nPerhaps make a point to ask specifically in the future how you should handle things like this. It can feel awkward if you're not used to being that direct, but it's also a great way to build communication skills everywhere in your life.\n\nJust saw your edit. \n\nNTA at all\n\nMy advice stands, but only because it took me too long to really grasp the concept and it's one of the hardest lessons to learn sometimes.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend is a drama who have no problem guilt-tripping you.

This wasn't childbirth or risky surgery, so there shouldn't have been any expectation you had to be with her.   Asking first would have avoided the problem, but absolutely NTA.  Next time ask.\n\nHer response to you was completely inappropriate.  This could have been the anesthesia talking for all we know.   Hopefully when she recovers she'll see this differently.

She sounds exhausting. Does she need you to entertain her all the time? If I'm in that much pain, I just want to take a painkiller and sleep until I feel better. For entertainment, I want something that doesn't require much effort, like watching a movie. I certainly don't need my own personal court jester, lol. I'd even find it a bit annoying and I wouldn't be good company. Just let me sleep. Maybe check in now and then to ask if I need something to eat or to pick up my meds for me, or just to make sure I'm alive, lol.\n\nShe's a grown-up, if she wanted you to come over she should have just asked.

Good luck OP.", "NTA \n\nFlush her painkillers to spite her.", "It would have been very nice of you to swing by her place with flowers and a movie \u2014 wisdom tooth removal is painful\u2014 but her reaction is scary! It\u2019s hard to tell whether she was just very disappointed and not able to express that in a healthy way, or whether she has some anger issues.

Very immature!  No need to get that upset especially when shes not asked.", "NTA. If she wanted you to do something she could've asked. Although with her being 19, and also probably in pain and on all sorts after her surgery, it's not a surprise she's being a bit immature.

She overreacted in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nwhen I took them off I took a painkiller and sat there quietly watching films, I wanted to be left in peace alone, it must be said that different people react differently to physical pain, there are those who want be left alone alone (like me) and who wants to be distracted (your girlfriend)\n\nbut it must be said that taking away 3 at once is quite a pain, even one is a terrible pain, but 3 at once is worse than a kick in the balls", "NTA - the important question:\n\nIs she always this reactionary, or could this outburst be due to the lingering effects of surgical anesthesia?\n\nIf the answer is \"yes, she be like that\", then you might consider that your GF is a bit whacky, and her toxic projections may warrant further investigation into her mental health.", " NTA.  Assuming she didnt text you something like \"I am so uncomfortable!  I wish you were here!\", how would you know that she wanted you to visit?

When I was 15 I had four wisdom teeth removed at once (two impacted and required removal in sections) plus had a growth removed from behind my front bottom teeth at the same time. My mouth was loaded with stitches. Yet I didn't touch the heavy duty painkillers they prescribed me and got by on applesauce and Tylenol. I was pretty much back to my old self by the very next day with the exception of sticking to soft foods. This isn't major surgery. Your gf sounds exhausting.", "YTA. I don't think it's shocking that she would want your support after getting her wisdom teeth out. I got my wisdom teeth out at 18 and my boyfriend drove 3 hours to spend the evening with me after the surgery. The next day my friends stopped by to check on me and bring me a smoothie. Thats what I do for others too, so it's not just one sided. I do agree that you need to ask your partner for things you want in a relationship. But there are some things that are a no brainer, and this is a prime example. She went too far with her insults but I agree you messed up big time.", "NTA\n\nShes an adult. You dont live with her and your job isnt to be her entertainment as soon as you get off work. Hitting the gym is fine. We all need to unwind. Her hissy fit is the issue.

If you don't have a rhythm with your partner that happens naturally (and you probably won't, and that's fine), just make this explicit. Bills are time sensitive, it should be no mystery at all who is going to pay them. Maybe Saturday morning is weekly housecleaning for the tasks that aren't daily.\n\nObviously if they're barely housetrained that sucks, but if they were thinking in their mind \"We should do groceries tomorrow night\" and you were thinking, \"We should do groceries this afternoon,\" and somehow you have a problem with the fact they didn't mind read you, that's a you problem, 100%.", "No, it isn't ridiculous.

Yes, if I see the dishwasher needs emptying, I empty it.  I even go check when I know it's ran.  But if she wants it emptied, by me, right now, she needs to communicate that.  If I want her to tag along when I go groceries, it's on me to say 'hey, want to come to the grocery store with me?' rather than to huff and mutter while putting on my shoes about how it's all going to be so heavy.\n\nThis whole 'mental load' thing if it was ever valid, certainly isn't used in a valid way nowadays.  Honestly, it's just tossed around as a way to transfer responsibility.  And it completely ignores the fact that having to anticipate your partner's thoughts is, in fact, a very unhealthy and toxic 'mental load.'\n\nIn the case of this particular one, hey, GF wants company after surgery?  She can ask.  What if he'd shown up unannounced and all she wanted to do was sleep?  How horrible! She's in pain, groggy from surgery, and now she has to entertain him! What an asshole!

A lot of people have dental anxiety (somewhat amplified I think because of the nonsense state of dental insurance here where you can have insurance and it\u2019s still quite expensive and limited in procedures it will cover) and nitrous oxide definitely helps.

That goes both ways.", "Eh, since this happened in germany, sedation is rather unusual and mostly happens with patients with a lot of anxiety about the procedure.

After that I couldn\u2019t stop crying because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me have a milkshake yet (I was still actively bleeding from my gums).

I just laid in bed the first few hours after I got home because the painkillers they shoot you up with during anesthesia are still working plus you take a preventative 800mg ibuprofen before the pain has a chance to start.

She\u2019s basically asking for you to care about her by telling you that you don\u2019t.

The anxiety from having drills in my face and hearing chunks of tooth being pulled out and having blood in my mouth made me swear in public when I normally wouldn't.
