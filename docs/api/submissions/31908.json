After work I went to the gym and not immeadiatly home, because I thought that, because we don't live together, I couldn't do much for her and I also thought that if she wanted me to distract her, she would text me that she wanted that. Before I go to the gym we exchange a few messages but at some point she stops responding.\n\nWhen I get home after the gym I get two messages from her. Roughly translated from German they were \"I Assume you are at the gym right now and probably didn't think about not going today to distract me from the pain\" and \"But I understand, you are like my mom, you don't give a fuck, you only care about your stuff and not at all about how I feel\". \n\nI then respond that if she wanted me to immediately  go home after work to call her on discord or something like that she could have texted me that she wants this and I also wrote that she please doesn't use accusations to talk to me because this doesn't help anyone. She then texted back \"Fuck you, you unloving asshole\"\n\nEdit: Some Info I May should have included in the post:\nMy GF isn't living alone, she still lives with her parents and her mom brought her to the doctor and back home again and as far as I know she also took some time off to take care of her. \nI didn't physically check in on her (which wouldn't even really have been possible on a monday because she lives an 1,5 hour drive away from me) but I texted her before the surgery, I checked in on how she was feeling by texting her during my lunch break which was like 10 minutes after her surgery had ended and I also asked her how she was feeling after work.", "created_utc": 1701169117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185tftp/aita_for_going_to_the_gym_after_work_instead_of/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If her extraction was like mine and many others I know, she was sedated for the procedure. The sedation makes people super emotional. I cried a lot and hid under a blanket, my brother in law was upset and accused my sister in-law or wanting to leave him. From this view I say NAH.", "NTA\n\nPeople in a relationship should be using their words with each other. Specifically--before the procedure, saying that she wanted OP to come over/call directly after work. Not just assuming that OP would intuit that is what she wanted, considering that they do not live together and someone must have been with her during the time after the surgery *before* OP got off work.", "NTA. She's a grown women, she can ask for help or suck it up and take a painkiller.", "NTA I feel like it would have been nice of you to atleast drop by and make sure she was okay but she could have mentioned that she would like you to come by instead of going off over text", "NTA, but you both need to use your big people voices and tell each other what you want. Her to tell and you to ask.", "I wouldn\u2019t say YTA, but it\u2019s not exactly difficult to foresee she would need support after this, and shouldn\u2019t have to ask if you know her. I can understand her feeling disappointed.", "ESH, yes she went ott with her texts but I disagree with people saying she should have asked, if she wanted attention. I mean really? she has surgery and you don't automatically ask how she is and if she needs anything after? Surely that's normal caring partner behavior.........or maybe I'm just lucky :/", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Imagine having to tell someone you love that they should be there for you when you get of surgery. Bro if actually cared for her you would have gone to see her. And why the hell would need to communicate that fact she wants to see her bf after she has had surgery. Imagine having a bf and having to tell him this. And I am pretty sure there more to the story than just this.", "ESH - she is overreacting with her texts, but you don\u2019t need to be a mind reader to know she would want your support. In fact you did think of it before you went to the gym, but you wanted to go to the gym so you rationalized it in your mind. \n\nIn a healthy relationship you shouldn\u2019t need to ask for every little thing. Some things should be automatic and easy. Apologize to your gf, bring her a bag of frozen peas for her face, and spend some time with her while she is miserable.", "I\u2019m going against the grain to say YTA. Or at least if not the AH, kind of inconsiderate. She had a painful procedure and it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to skip the gym for one day and check in on her. I don\u2019t think not living with her makes a difference, you can still go by and see how she is, ask if she needs anything. You\u2019re supposed to love this person, so they have to spell out every time they need some care from you?\n\nHowever, I may be biased. When I had my wisdom teeth out my FWB, not even official boyfriend, came over and looked after me (while also laughing with me at my useless dribbly face). And now 15 years later that FWB is my husband.", "YTA - Look, since you are young I'll give you a discount, but let me explain how relationships work, you must know how to put yourself in the other person's shoes, I understand that for you it didn't seem like a big deal, but man... She had a surgery (small but still) You could have at least gone there and talked to her a little, given her some of your attention and then gone to the gym, no? I believe there are things people shouldn't have to ask for when they are in relationships, she can't ask you \"Hey, come here, take care of me!\" I think you lacked a little sensitivity, but I understand that her reaction was exaggerated, you guys need to have a talk.", "ESH. If you know someone is having surgery, it\u2019s nice to make the effort to be there for them. It sucks getting wisdom teeth removed, but even suckier if your partner doesn\u2019t even check in with you and see how you\u2019re doing. However, she\u2019s been super rude and nasty about it all.", "Nta she's being dramatic, if she wanted you to come over, she should have asked you.", "You know, basic case after surgery would be nice. you could've skipped gym. its not about distraction, shes gonna be in pain for DAYS maybe 2 weeks. Could've gotten her something cold to eat, since she cant chew or swallow really.\n\nAnd yep, id be pissed to if i was lower priority after surgery than gym and other crappy outings.\n\nHow would you feel if it was you in her shoes?\n\nYou sounds really ignorant and selfish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: YTA undoubtedly.\n\nedit: for all saying she \"could've asked\" uyy its exhausting to have to ask every time for anything small constantly. It would be nice if a partner stopped using that as excuse that because she didn't ask, he didn't know. The fact is, he didn't give a flip, and because she didn't ask, he didn't feel obliged, and didn't feel like being there for supposedly his loved one, during painful time, literally really painful time. Painkillers only do so much. It costs nothing to care and to offer emotional support. Fact is, HE DIDN'T WANT TO so he didn't even think of it.\n\nThats why YTA. If she has to ask for something this basic, what kinda relationship is that? Its not like asking for someone to go to store to grab something. This is basic relationship thing.", "NTA, it feels like it escalated pretty quickly. \n\nIf anything, it's a good way for her to learn how to communicate her feelings: if she was bored and wanted to see you, she could have asked you to come over. When you didn't offer, she immediately assumed it was out of disinterest for her, while, on your side, you assumed she didn't want you to.\n\nYes, you could have offered just to check, but it still didn't warrant such an aggressive last response on her side.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot read her mind, and know her pain. I am for example capable of distracting myself even though I live with my GF. Different people have different needs. Maybe you could ask, but her reaction is selfish and definitely overreacting.\n\nBtw when they pulled my wisdom teeth, after anesthetics went off I didn't feel any pain. It was an easy, nice painless procedure so it can also be different per person. \n\nDon't assume, ask. Both of you :)", "ESH. She was rude. You should have cared about her surgery.", "ESH, but more her than you.\n\nDude. She was your girlfriend and she had a minor surgery. You should have checked in with her right after work to ask her how it went and see if she needed anything.\n\nHer texts are an unpleasant combination of passive aggressive and openly aggressive rudeness. In pain or not, you don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with someone who can\u2019t control their temper or communicate their needs and feelings in a reasonable manner. A mature adult would have expressed her needs reasonably. Ditch this harpy. \n\nI hope your ex-girlfriend feels better soon. Maybe be a little more considerate with your next girlfriend.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe Drama Queen should search for a mind reader in the circus or apply for a Korean drama show.", "YTA, after such an ordeal your GF will be both upset & in pain, if as it seems she gets little support from her mother she was hoping that you as her loving bf might be there to support & comfort her, but no you preferred to go to the gym !!", "ESH. Your gf suck for thinking you're a mind reader and you suck because you didn't think to ask if there's something you can do for her when she had her wisdom teeth removed. Both of you need to learn to communicate.", "They told me I couldn\u2019t be left alone for at least 24 hours after I had my wisdom teeth out in case I haemorrhaged. Has the advice changed now? Did either of you discuss this at all? And did she just take herself to the surgery and back alone?", "Dude, I don't usually jump to this but you need a new gf. This one is broken. NTA", "NTA\n\nWould it have been nice for you to enquire how she was after her surgery and offer to spend time with/help her as required? Yes\n\nWas it reasonable for her to expect you to do that without her asking? No\n\nDid she chuck a tanty and act like a complete AH after the fact? Well, yes, yes she did\n\nCould you cut her some slack because she is probably in pain and is just looking for someone to blame? Depends if she's hot or not", "NTA as a grown woman she should have told you she wanted you to be with her as she\u2019s in pain but as her boyfriend it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to ask if she needed you", "ESH. If she wanted your attention, she should have let you know. You could've had some caring forethought and skipped gym to check on her anyway. My hubby had 4 wisdom teeth taken out and he was a mess for the first few days. Just sleepy and needy.", "NTA\n\nAlbeit you could indeed imagine she could need support, this is a clear case of her demanding you read her mind and do what she didn't even ask, which can be classified as a stupid mind game. And, for definition, if you play stupid games you win stupid prices. \n\nQuite frankly, dump her ass. This behavior will almost surely come back at the next struggle.", "NTA\n\n>\"I Assume you are at the gym right now and probably didn't think about not going today to distract me from the pain\" and \"But I understand, you are like my mom, you don't give a fuck, you only care about your stuff and not at all about how I feel\".\n\n>I then respond that if she wanted me to immediately go home after work to call her on discord or something like that she could have texted me that she wants this\n\nExactly this. Y'all were texting so she really could've used her mouth words and said that it would be cool if you swing by or whatever. Instead of expecting you to be able to read her mind and getting pissed that you didn't know what she would've liked from you when she didn't say anything of the sort.\n\nWhy do so many get pissed at the SO not doing what they think they'd like or think would be expected, but without opening their mouth and saying so?", "[deleted]", "NTA. Ive had my wisdom teeth removed and could do almost whatever I wanted at home besides eat solids. Wtf where you suppose to do for her besides sit there and listen to her mumble?", "NTA\n\ni had an incredibly painful operation and very much wanted to be left alone afterwards \n\nif she asked and you said no there\u2019s a conversation about you being an AH. but she\u2019s a grown woman, if she wants something she can use her words and ask for it", "Wouldn\u2019t necessarily call you the AH but you\u2019re selfish. You should follow up with her instead of expecting her to ask. You should have asked how she\u2019s feeling, if she needs anything, etc. \nYou\u2019re young and you\u2019re a man so I can give you some grace as I understand men aren\u2019t typically brought up to be caring in this way, but this should be a lesson on how to treat people you love in the future :)", "She is only 19 and just had surgery, I'm not surprised she is acting immature. I don't think she handled herself well but I also think OP could have taken more initiative and asked if she needed him for anything since taking care of her is part of what a good boyfriend should do.", "why did she have to ask? why couldnt he just go over or offer to come to check in at least? Why is he waiting around to be asked if he loves her?", "I already apologized to her over text (after she insulted me a couple more times) and the response I got was \"Fuck you, you should have known\" . Now she is giving me the silent treatment.", "1,5 hours to get to her house and 1,5 hours to get back to his.   \n\n\n3 hours of driving is something basic? When u live that far away you have to make sure that the person itself wants you there, there is a lot of people that don't like to be around others when are in pain and just want to rest or something else.  \n\n\nAnd anyway, why is that big of a deal that they talk about it? Not everything have to be unspoken to have value, specially if its the first time asking for something like that.", "She is living with her parents, her mom brought her to the doctor and back and took care of her.", "Having your wisdom teeth pulled isn\u2019t really surgery, it\u2019s just pulling teeth. Take some pain killers and watch some tv or something. \n\nThe gf is the AH for that response.", "Because she lives with her parents lol. Also I've had my wisdom teeth removed and I definitely would not want my partner seeing me all puffy.", "Because adults communicate.", "Well you should have known. In fact you did know, and chose to ignore it. Like I said her reaction is wrong, but you are wrong here too.", "Oh, ok, then NTA - but you guys should probably talk about it when she isn\u2019t in pain"]}
