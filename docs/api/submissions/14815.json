We were there to celebrate my brother\u2019s engagement. My parents were hosting the dinner at a restaurant and it was the first time Wife and I met my brother\u2019s fiancee (Anna) as we don\u2019t live near my family.\n\nWife is deaf and wears hearing aids, my family are aware that she\u2019s deaf. My parents have learnt a few signs so they can interact with her. As she is deaf, we have been teaching Lizzie sign language. When we are in loud environments, Wife is often overwhelmed by all the noise and turns off her hearing aids. When this happens, we tell Lizzie in advance and she knows that if she needs her mum\u2019s attention to either stamp her feet or bang on the table so that Wife can feel the vibrations and know that Lizzie wants her.\n\nWhen we got the restaurant, it was loud so Wife told me she was turning off her hearing aids and would just lip read. Brother and Anna hadn\u2019t arrived yet, but my parents were there and they apologised for the restaurant being louder than they expected. My parents understand why she turns off her hearing aids and had tried to pick somewhere quiet. When brother and Anna arrived, I told them that Wife had turned off her hearing aids. Brother just rolled his eyes while Anna had a slight look of disgust. Anna was sat next to Wife at the table, Lizzie was the opposite side of Wife. Part way through dinner, Lizzie banged the table next to Wife wanting her attention, but as Wife was conversing with Anna she didn\u2019t respond to Lizzie straight away. So Lizzie banged on the table a second time, and she got Wife\u2019s attention to be taken to the toilet. While they were gone, Anna snapped at me telling me that we need to teach Lizzie not to be rude. I tried explaining that this is how Lizzie gets her mum\u2019s attention when she had turned off her hearing aids and we encourage it, but Anna continued that this was rude and we should parent better. Anna referred to wife as being defective, so I made the decision for us to leave. I apologised to my parents, offered to pay for our meal and picked up our belongings. My parents insisted that Anna apologised but Brother agreed that the table banging had been rude.\n\nThat evening, I got an angry phone call from my brother (with Anna shouting in the background) furious that I had made a scene at the restaurant and left when it was Lizzie banging on the table that had been rude. He also wants me to pay him back for dinner as my parents made him pay for dinner because Anna had been rude and they didn\u2019t want to give her the idea that they supported her behaviour \u2013 they left just after we did.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m NTA as this is normal to me with Wife being deaf but it might look rude to people on the outside.\n\nEdit: Lizzie was sat on the end of the table. Wife was to her left and I was to her right. Yes, she could have asked me to take her to the toilet but Lizzie doesn't like going into the men's and prefer to go with her mum.

While generally I would say not to teach your kid to bang on the table, she's doing it for a specific purpose that's acceptable in the Deaf community for attention getting.  HOWEVER,  this tactic is usually used amongst Deaf individuals WITH deaf individuals.  YOu need to be teaching yoru child to get her attention in a variety of circumstances.  There were multiple avenues of getting your wife's attention in this scenario, that aren't as intrusive in a public setting and your Daughter needs to be taught them as well. She's three, so you have some time.  Just don't make table banging her go to, when there's other non-intrusive ways of getting a deaf person's attention.  The first time she banged, YOU should have gotten your wife's attention instead of letting her keep on banging.  \n\nNTA", "NTA Don't pay him back and let him know that any time his fiancee decides to try to tell them how to parent their child and insults your wife, the response will be the same. And him, too. \n\nHas your brother always been snarky and insulting and dismissive of your wife and her hearing issues?", "NTA \u2014 Huge yikes on Anna for being a fucking ableist. Thank you for standing up for your wife and daughter.", "NTA. Eye rolling, looks of disgust, unsolicited parenting advice, straight up ableist insults.... I'd be done with Anna & brother forever.", "NTA. You have a small child and it\u2019s reasonable as to why she needs to bang on the table. The eye roll from your brother was uncalled for as well. Maybe he\u2019ll need hearing aids in his old age one day and see maybe that his SIL wasn\u2019t just being dramatic. Your brother and his fianc\u00e9 are both jerks.", "NTA here, but I think you probably need to find a different way for Lizzie to get her mother's attention in public, because this is probably going to come up again. Table-banging does irritate people. So you're in the clear this time, but just for future reference, maybe discuss a better way for her to do it.", "NTA. I can't even believe your brother and his wife even went there tbh. And to refer to your wife as defective?! How shameful of them. But good for you, for sticking up for your wife and your family. You did the right thing.", "I first read it as\u2026.\u201dencouraging my daughter to bang at the dinner table\u201dWhew.", "Absolutely NTA. Anna sounds like an ableist, very disrespectful of her to say what she said. Especially considering it was the first time y\u2019all met. You would think she\u2019d want to make a good impression. Calling your wife \u201cdefective\u201d, trying to tell you how to parent your own kid, blowing up on you is all disgusting behavior.", "NTA - Wow, Anna is a massive asshole.\n\nAlso should go without saying but don't pay for the dinner.", "NTA. Anna is an AH, but SO IS YOUR BROTHER. Your parents however are lovely.", "[deleted]", "Like\u2026not gonna lie. That title had me thinking \u201cI thought I was a sex positive parent, but this guy makes me look like a prude\u201d. \n\nDefinitely went another direction lol", "Definitely NTAH, your little girl was doing what she was taught to do.  Your brother and wife however...", "NTA. Like at all and I hate when kids are disrespectful in restaurants.\n\nShe banged on a table - twice. And with legitimate need.\n\nAt some point as she ages, this behavior will be a bit more rude, so I do encourage you to continue to expand her repertoire of getting her mother\u2019s attention in loud environments. But she\u2019s three and this is easy to understand, and easy to execute. \n\nAnna however is walking inferno of an AH.", "NTA \n\nWhat a way for Anna to make herself hated by her Inlaws. I can just imagine the arguments your brother and your parents are going to have.", "ESH, you need to find a different way for your daughter to get your wife's attention in public.\n\n It IS rude to bang on the table in public or in someone else's home. Not just because the noise can be startling and annoying,  but it shows a lack of respect for the property of the restaurant or people whose home you are visiting.", "NTA: Anna is really very special, isn't she. She is  rude, entitled, ungracious and uninformed. I wish your brother luck.", "ESH. Banging on the table imo isn\u2019t socially acceptable and no one who isn\u2019t part of your party will understand it\u2019s because your wife is deaf. You should really teach your daughter the signs for \u201cbathroom\u201d and whatever else she may need as that\u2019s a less disruptive way to communicate. She\u2019s at a great age to learn ASL entirely as kids are sponges. On the other hand Anna was disrespectful and out of line calling your wife defective. I think that\u2019s a worse offense than the banging on the table.", "NTA.  Kids also throw things to get attention of deaf parents.  It seems outlandish to throw a balled up paper at a patent but that\u2019s what needs to be done in that context.  People need to be open minded and understand that their rules don\u2019t always apply.", "NTA and your future SIL is rude and should never be allowed to refer to your wife as defective. Your daughter was following your rules and those are what matter", "NTA. At all! Your brother and his fianc\u00e9 are huge ones though. Those are people I would cut out of my life.  \n\nIf they can't understand that Lizzie and your wife have different ways of communicating due to your wife being deaf, then they aren't people I would want my family around.", "NTA.\n\nAre there other ways Lizzie should be learning to get her mother\u2019s attention? Probably. Is it any of your brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s business? Not fucking likely.\n\nAlso, tell your brother that he should be more concerned about the behaviour of the toddler *he* brought to dinner, since his is *old enough to drive and vote*.", "yta why can't she tell you what she needs and you sign it to your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You did the right thing.", "I was going to say that you should have made sure Lizzie was next to your wife, probably in between you at 3, to make it easier for her to get your wife's attention (or yours) but your SIL just decided to be bold in her wrongness. I am sorry that happened and you are NTA.", "NTA. Banging on a table is a rather common way for hearing people to get a deaf person's attention. Anna could've just shown your wife that your daughter needed her attention. She and your brother were rude from the start with the eye rolling and look of disgust.", "NTA I grew up with deaf friends and was fully involved in the deaf community in college. This isn't a kid misbehaving. This is a kid communicating with her deaf mother.", "I agree with this. OP is NTA by a long shot, however, certainly training Lizzie to capture wife's attention in a variety of environments would be the best way to move forward. Thank you for standing up for your wife. I'm sorry your family members disrespect her disability. I'm glad to hear your parents at least seemed to have the right attitude towards this situation though!", ">Has your brother always been snarky and insulting and dismissive of your wife and her hearing issues?\n\nHe has been. We are no longer as close as we once were after he suggested that I find a 'normal' partner. He is the only one who has refused to learn a few signs.", "More than that it can knock stuff off the table. It\u2019s probably better for daughter to sit next to one parent so they\u2019re on point, and when it\u2019s her mom she can tap her shoulder or something.", "Scrolled to find this because I figured I wasn\u2019t the only one! Greatly relieved!!", "Oh the brother and his wife are definitely TA. Especially when they called his wife defective. It wasn't having a tantrum or a fit, the child was trying to get their *deaf* mother's attention. Using vibrations is a very effective and reasonable method of trying to grab a deaf person's attention.", "I agree with this.  I don\u2019t justify Anna\u2019s behavior. I think she was unnecessarily rude.  Banging on a table in public can be disruptive, but I get the rationale.\n\nInfo:  given that this was a difficult situation with the restaurant being so loud, why didn\u2019t you have your daughter sit with you instead?", "True in terms of the child capturing her mother's attention, but I disagree with \"what's okay at home isn't necessarily okay in a public setting.\" This would be seen as a reasonable accommodation for a guest. It was already a loud environment, so I would assume a child banging on the table to get her deaf mother's attention would be acceptable. The problem is too many people are triggered by other people in public because they are so accustomed to their ways of doing things. Most able-bodied people don't understand simple difficulties those with disabilities struggle with simply because they have never been exposed to those struggles in their life. We all need to be more understanding and tolerant of each other. Just like we can't expect any rights to privacy in public, we have no rights to what the general population consider \"acceptable\" in public, especially when there's a valid reason for it such as this.", "I agree. I was thinking maybe she could get dads attention and he can either help child or get mums attention in some other way. Or wave at mom or something? I agree that what\u2019s appropriate at home isn\u2019t always appropriate outside. I completely understand the disability aspect, but there other people also trying to dine. I can see why Anna would comment on it, however the comment about your wife being defective was extremely shocking to say the least. Hurtful, wrong and just awful. I think it\u2019s too strong to say you\u2019re the a hole, but there was mistakes on both parts. Anna\u2019s was worse. ESH I think is the closest. Good that your parents supported you and you stood up for your wife that\u2019s great!", "The kid knows the signs, but to call the attention of someone who can't hear you requires that she do it in a physical way.", "Well looks like your brother really met his soul(less) mate. \nNTA", "Yeah, it seemed obvious that he had talked to his fiancee about your wife before they got there because she was just ready to jump on anything. Your parents have never addressed him about this before? You? I would kinda have to consider going LC or even NC with someone like this, no matter how close you were before.", "I was thinking this too. If Lizzie had been next to her mother, it wouldn't have come up.\n\nBut I also think that brother and his awful betrothed would still have started SOMETHING.

Trying to make them understand that their definitions of what is acceptable, might not be the same as everyone else, is damn near impossible.", "then she can touch the mother to get her attention or the mom shouldn't turn off her aides banging on a table in a crowded restaurant is rude. like the reason why people don't like kids in restaurants", "Still doesn't explain why She can't say Dad, I need Mom or just touch your wife to get her attention.", "So ... she could have reached out and TAPPED her mother then?", "She\u2019s seated across from mom and can\u2019t reach (which is an oversight of the parents IMO).", ">Still doesn't explain why She can't say Dad, I need Mom\n\nBecause she is a very stubborn toddler who likes to do things by herself. Lizzie tends to not tap or touch Wife unless she wants to be picked up.", "You are literally saying this child should not be able to directly communicate their needs, with their own mother. Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds? \n\nThey were in a loud restaurant, I highly doubt the banging was so outrageous that every other diner in the restaurant stopped to stare at them. Heck I doubt they even noticed.", ">So ... she could have reached out and TAPPED her mother then?\n\nLizzie tends to not tap or touch Wife unless she wants to be picked up.", "either way she ca open her mouth and get her dad's attention and he can get he moms attention. asshole parenting on both their parts", "No. She was next to her. And next to her dad.", "She needs to be taught to.", "No they are literally saying there are alternate options for the child to communicate her needs.", "No I am literally saying that the child and the mother need to learn how to function in a variety of settings and communication modes.  That's what happens when you have a deaf parent.  The issues that CODA children face are numerous. You probably dont' know shit about the subject, but feel free to weigh in.", "That's when you teach her. To be clear I definitely think your brother and Anna are HUGE assholes but a three year old is capable of learning to tap if needed.", "They have learned how to cope and function and a variety of settings. Problem is you're just not comfortable with their preferred mode of communication in loud, public settings. That's not their issue, it's yours.\n\nHell, even if their mother isn't deaf, it isn't really rude to begin with. Just because a bunch of Boomers decided it was a long time ago, doesn't make it so.\n\nPS My brother is 78% deaf; he wears hearing aids, is a lip reading champ, and if you speak really really, crowd disturbingly, loud, he can kind of sort of understand what you're saying.

DO tell me.  How do you know? What other communication techniques have they taught this three year old.  The simplest one, is tapping the person sitting right next to you, but apparently that one hasn't been taught.  \n\nOh your brother is hard of hearing.

But maybe in restaurants where your daughter is sitting next to your wife you should  get her to tap her arm or hand, something like that if she can reach.  Because as you found out in this instance your wife won't always feel the vibrations.

OP is NTA and their parenting is fine.   Brother and fiancee are the A Hs and seem to have an intolerance of people who have different abilities, but the child could certain tap her mother's arm gently or have Dad take her to the restroom (or grandma if they aren't comfortable with Dad taking her in the men's room, if it's not unisex).", "This!
