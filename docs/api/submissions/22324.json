FMIL invites her friends and tells my fianc\u00e9 he can invite whoever he wants. He usually has 1-2 friends come. This year, we had 1 friend say yes, and his brother who doesn't like camping, but tags along.\n\nThe weekend before camping, FMIL calls to talk about how to split food for camping. She told us to buy ribs, chicken wings, sausages, veggies, beer for everyone. Sounded like we were getting the more expensive things, but we said no problem.\n\nDuring the week, my fianc\u00e9 messages his mom to let her know that if she plans to get him a gift for his birthday, money is better. The reason for that is she tends to give... random gifts lol. For context, we got tire covers for xmas one year lol. She's asked him for money for her birthday before, he's asked her too, no biggie here. She wrote back and said, \"Camping is your gift.\" That upset me, because FMIL is notorious for being inconsiderate and mistreating my fianc\u00e9. She's the type of mother who believes her children should take care of her. I told him to ask her if she's paying us back for all of the food we got for the trip then, and she replies it's their cultural tradition that the birthday person pays for their guests on their birthday. First we hear of that, LOL! I'm upset, but my fiance says it's better to keep the peace and just go. I said I would support him no matter what.\n\nFriday arrives, by the time we packed and were on the road, it's 6pm with a 2.5 hr drive to the campsite. \n\nMy FMIL was already at the campsite with limited cell signal and didn't tell us how to get there. So, we GPS the lake location and follow that. 15 minutes away, we are on a road that gets tighter and rocky. Hesitant to keep going, we get past a section that was risky, but my fiance's brother in the other car tries to pass over that same section and gets stuck. The area ahead is flooded due to a storm with tornado warning the day before, there's no way our cars can get through and it's a 1 hr detour to get to the campsite. It's 9pm, everyone's unhappy, we decide to turn back home. We would rather not set up our tents at 10pm in the dark on a potentially very muddy area.\n\nMy FMIL sends a message to ask where we are. My fianc\u00e9 tells her there was no road for us to get there, so we are going back home. FMIL tells us to come in the morning and fianc\u00e9 says no. FMIL does not show any concern for us, and instead says that she's VERY disappointed, they didn't bring any veggies (we have them), they have too much meat (I woke up at 430am earlier in the week to bring that to her before I went to work) and \"not enough beer\". This definitely doesn't sound like a birthday celebration for my fianc\u00e9, and we decided (us, his friend and his brother) that we'd rather just spend time together at home to celebrate his birthday where he's actually the highlight of the activity.\n\nAre we the assholes for turning back home and not going back this morning?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689438474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150gb4j/aita_for_turning_back_to_go_home_when_we_were_15/", "score": 530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\ude39 she was absolutely terrible to him in his childhood. He says she\u2019s MUCH improved since then. I say she still has plenty more room for improvement and should keep going.", "At least if he could pick how he gets to celebrate his birthday and \u201ctreat his guests\u201d\u2026 the camping was imposed and we assumed it was just a \u201cyearly tradition\u201d that she plans it around his birthday.

He\u2019s not a pushover, so I trust him to not let her take advantage of us. I can understand having to pick your battles to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d sometimes.

It sounds like what my friend\u2019s parents did for him and his sisters\u2019 birthdays. Sure there was food and they had cake, every one told them happy birthday, but it was an adult party. Drinking, very late party into the night.

That\u2019s her gift, if she wants another gift she can pay him for the food you supplied and you will plan a restaurant get together. Of course she will pay since it\u2019s culturally appropriate for birthday person to pay for food. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get money back but with meat so $$$$$ to pay for food for a trip you don\u2019t attend is not acceptable. No offense but your FMIL is a jerk. Happy Birthday to your SO!
