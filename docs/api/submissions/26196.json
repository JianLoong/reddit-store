My (41f) mother (60f) and I have an okay relationship. It\u2019s been getting better since I have been grown, had children and done some healing from my childhood and early adulthood. I wrote a book, under a pen name, that details some of my experiences and how I overcame the trauma of those events. Some of these events are about my mom and some are about healing from other things in life, like abuse, cancer, etc. I don\u2019t paint my mother in a horrible light but I tell my story from my truth, when it pertains to her. When I get to the healing part of the journey I even express empathy and understanding as to why my mom did some of the things she did. \n\nMy mom has a habit of making EVERYTHING about her. It is tiring, and I am experienced enough with her at this point to navigate in such a way that allows her to be herself (she hasn\u2019t done much healing of her own) and remain apart of my life. I have two children that she adores and I don\u2019t want to cut them off from their only grandmother. \n\nSo, once I was ready for publication, I told my mom, because I am not heartless and didn\u2019t want to blindside her. I sent her a proof to read, even though I don\u2019t use anyone\u2019s real names, she is PISSED. She said I make her look like a monster, (she literally was one of the monsters in my story for a long time) and if I publish this book she will never speak to me and write me out of her will. I am her only living child. I don\u2019t care about the will but she is threatening to not talk to me. My siblings passed away and it\u2019s just me and her left.\n\nNow I am wondering if I should not publish. I didn\u2019t write the book to paint her in a bad light.   She isn\u2019t even the main trauma. I wrote the book because people that know me would always say, \u201cyou should write a book, it could really help others.\u201d So one day, I did just that. \n\nAITA or is my mom making herself the center again and manipulating me out of publishing my hard work.", "created_utc": 1693832203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169raiy/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_i_was_writing_a_book/", "score": 1102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd say, rename your book, get a different pen name, change the names of the characters again, change up a few dates and publish anyway because I'm sure it was a lot of hard work. And if people have told you that it could help others to read your journey, then maybe it could. \n\nHowever, you never should have given it to your mother to read because you clearly state that she hasn't had the healing that you've had. How did you expect her to take your book? Did you honestly expect a different reaction from a person you know hasn't changed?\n\nI also feel like you haven't had the healing you think you've had. I'd wager that somewhere deep down you knew that your book would hurt her and you gave it to her to read anyway. Work on those feelings. Maybe in therapy? Having your therapist read your book would be a good idea, because if you've written this book recently, they could give you insight into how you're really feeling about your past in this moment based on the language and tone of your book. \n\nLastly, kudos on writing a book.

There was no way she was going to have taken this well. The only reason to do this so openly is to hurt her back and maybe take steps to write her off. I guarantee if you move forward she will spend the rest of her life vilifying you to everyone you two know.

I think that people say \"you should write a book\" because they like living vicariously through others they know in person, but I simply can't imagine reading or caring much about a stranger's trauma if they're trying to monetise it. Nor can I imagine writing about my own trauma for strangers to pick apart. It feels a little bit like an ego trip that should've been journaled or taken to a therapist, in private. I think you knew what you were potentially opening yourself up to by showing your mother, and quite honestly if you really need to write about this you should've waited until she was dead and didn't have to suffer the repercussions of 'your truth'.", "Why did you send it to your mother if it was under a pen name and the names were changed? It would not have blindsided her at all unless you are expecting her to happen upon your book and read it and then recognise herself. I suspect your motives here to be honest. But there is not enough information to make a judgement.", "NTA I understand why you showed her the book and I\u2019m guessing you hoped for a better outcome. Whatever you choose to do, I don\u2019t think your relationship will be the same again. It might take awhile before she accepts your truth of the past, if she does at all.

You've made a rod for your own back now.", "[removed]", "NTA, but it's not surprising at all that your abusive mom isn't happy about getting called out in your book. If you're publishing it under a pen name and aren't using her real name in the book, you should've just not told her about the book. She didn't need to know. Now that the cat's out of the bag, your only real options are publishing the book regardless and letting her be unhappy, deciding not to publish the book, changing content in such a way that your mom is cool with it, or lying to your mom that you scrapped the book and publishing it without telling her. Personally, I'd lie. Just make sure the content isn't identifiable to her (i.e., that her character's name is very different from her real name, that her character has a different job, etc.) and that she doesn't know your pen name.", "NTA", "NTA. If you\u2019re being completely honest about how your mother treated you in your book, then it is quite unequivocally her own fault. She\u2019s most definitely trying to manipulate you.

Your mother is being wholly unreasonable.", "NTA But I think that what OP really wanted was for her mom to accept responsibility - and maybe even apologize -  for the stuff she did during OPs childhood. That isn't going to happen. But I bet is was cathartic to write this stuff down.\n\nI'd wait on publishing the book, maybe 5 or 10 years. By then, the kids will have realized what a jerk your mom is, and WANT to avoid her.", "NTA.\n\nAs you said, since she hasn't done much healing herself, keeping a relationship with her require absolute acceptance.\n\nAbsolute acceptance that she probably cannot hold accountability for what she did. Absolute acceptance that she probably will never change.\n\n >  I have two children that she adores and I don\u2019t want to cut them off from their only grandmother. \n\n I don't know how she is with your children. I don't know what your children think of their grandmother. \nI understand you are willing to take the brunt of her abuse so that you can provide your children with a grandmother. \n But I don't think that is fair to you, nor to your children. \n\nI'm biased, because I come from an abusive family (intergenerational abuse).  Me and my siblings were often left alone with the same people who scarred my mother for life. My mother had gone no contact with her parents, but chose to have them back in her life so we could have grandparents. \n\nWhile they didn't treat us as badly as they had treated her, I could see my mother's body tense each time we went at their place.\nShe was visibly stressed out. She held her tongue when her parents insulted her in front of us.\n\nI remember one time that was particularly bad. She had tried to move away from the children, and get the adults in the kitchen. Even as they whispered, even if I couldn't understand what they were saying, I felt scared and sick, not knowing what was happening. Mother left in tears, and we children had to stay with the people that had hurt her. I was 6.\n\nAgain, I don't know how it is with your children. But I don't think you would be wrong to take some space from your mother.

She wrote a book about her dysfunctional family. In her mind, it was for healing. \n\nI begged her to keep me out of it.

Narcissists don\u2019t work that way. Maybe it was your way of blowing up your relationship with her? Maybe you were looking for validation? \n\nWhatever the reason was, I think you need to look into more therapy. Most beneficially, therapy for you both.

Don\u2019t give in.", "oh this is very difficult because I have an idea of some of the kind of thing you are describing as I had both a close and difficult relationship with my mum.  She was the kindest soul to strangers but could be so manipulative with me at times. And my siblings treating one way and another  a different way and telling one one version of a story and another a different version.  So in a way I understand.  Its amazing that you wrote a book about it.  I am not sure I would have chosen to publish but have just written it for cathartic reasons.  I am also not sure if I would have told my mum in that situation.  But now you have done it I can see why she is hurt because she may not have seen things in the same light that you did.  I think that now its out in the open you need to try to discuss things in a new light, a new truth because unfortunately the real truth is not yours and its not hers but its probably somewhere in between, our truths in this way are overshadowed by our emotions and our perceptions and perceptions can change with new information.  You need to tell your mum I am so sorry that this book hurt you it was never meant to do that but it is my truth and it is how I felt about these things that happened but perhaps its now my turn to hear your truth about these things.  Would you like to go to counselling with me because I know you have a experienced a lot of hurt too and I didn't intend to hurt you further.  Its hard as you need to support her without your own emotional baggage getting in the way but you also have to be careful not to be too supportive so as to enable her manipulation.  its a difficult line, believe me I know that one. She must have a lot of hurt from losing her children as you have about losing your siblings.  Grief can be hard. Tell her how much you want, and need her in your life and that despite everything written in this book that you love her very much and don't care about the will.  Tell her you promise not to publish until you have discussed it further.  Say to her if you choose to publish after the discussion then you could let her write the afterword or forward.

I have been in a similar situation so feel qualified to say this.\n\nESH. You\u2019re a grown ass adult and can write what you want. \n\nBecause you are actively trying to have a relationship with her, you have caused hurt (even if what you have written about her is true). It will definitely have hurt and maybe a sign that you\u2019re not as healed as you think.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you wanted to share an achievement with her and it has backfired badly.\n\nI would suggest changing your pseudonym, using a disclaimer and ensuring there is nothing that can identify anybody if you don\u2019t want to get sued.\n\nI wrote a book. It snowballed overnight and made it into the Amazon top 100 in the UK.\nYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be happy about it, but it left me open to some of the most vile criticism from strangers. You will need to grow a thick skin as people will take the worst parts of your past and ridicule them. Not everybody - but there will be some.\n\nCongrats on writing your book, it is an achievement in itself. I hope it brings you the healing you deserve.
