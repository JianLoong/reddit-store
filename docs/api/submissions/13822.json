Don't play games.", "Look the fact that your husband sat you down and told you and apologized speaks volumes. The fact that his friend is coming over to apologize is even louder. They knew they screwed up and it wasn\u2019t okay. They probably already feel bad as it is, so maybe just accept the apology if you want but don\u2019t turn this into needing to get even.", "Did your husband's friend ask to see the photo of you topless or did your husband decide to show him the photo first?

The friend may be a creep(if he asked to see photos) but you entrusted those photos to your husband and he kind of broke your trust.  Basically dont be harder on the friend than your husband because it's actually husband's fault.", "Make them sweat if you so wish.

This story could've went so much worse.", "YWBTA-this is more an issue (in my eyes) between you and your husband. Your husband seems to feel bad about what he did from what is written here.", "YWBTA, frankly you have no reason to make his friend feel bad, make your husband feel bad for showing topless photos of his wife without her permission which is weird and gross. Humiliating and embarrassing his friend just makes a gross situation even more weird. I mean if you\u2019re hoping the guy never comes around again, and likely tells his wife how weird you and your husband are, go ahead because do you really think he isn\u2019t going to tell his wife knowing you know and were bothered/upset about it enough he felt he needed to apologize?", "NTA, the crossed a line and as such deserves to have some punishment, and you deserve to make them squirm", "Your husband is an absolute narc lmao", "YWNBTA, but the bigger issue is your husband deleting those photos. Your husband shouldn't have private photos of you on his phone if he's going to show them to his friends just because he has a drink", "NTA  I personally would be horrified.", "NTA. That\u2019s actually a huge violation and technically a crime. You don\u2019t HAVE to be upset, if you\u2019re not, and you can forgive your husband but just know that in the eyes of the law your husband has committed a sex crime by sharing intimate photos of you without your consent. \n\nYou are well within your rights to make them feel really bad and awkward. They *should* feel really bad and awkward. They are grown men, not dumb teenage boys. They don\u2019t need to be sharing the intimate details of their committed relationships and they definitely don\u2019t need to be sharing intimate photos.", "Why would you even want to make this more awkward than it already is?
