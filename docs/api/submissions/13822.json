Don't play games.", "Look the fact that your husband sat you down and told you and apologized speaks volumes. The fact that his friend is coming over to apologize is even louder. They knew they screwed up and it wasn\u2019t okay. They probably already feel bad as it is, so maybe just accept the apology if you want but don\u2019t turn this into needing to get even.", "Did your husband's friend ask to see the photo of you topless or did your husband decide to show him the photo first?

The friend may be a creep(if he asked to see photos) but you entrusted those photos to your husband and he kind of broke your trust.  Basically dont be harder on the friend than your husband because it's actually husband's fault.", "Make them sweat if you so wish.

This story could've went so much worse.", "YWBTA-this is more an issue (in my eyes) between you and your husband. Your husband seems to feel bad about what he did from what is written here.", "YWBTA, frankly you have no reason to make his friend feel bad, make your husband feel bad for showing topless photos of his wife without her permission which is weird and gross. Humiliating and embarrassing his friend just makes a gross situation even more weird. I mean if you\u2019re hoping the guy never comes around again, and likely tells his wife how weird you and your husband are, go ahead because do you really think he isn\u2019t going to tell his wife knowing you know and were bothered/upset about it enough he felt he needed to apologize?", "NTA, the crossed a line and as such deserves to have some punishment, and you deserve to make them squirm", "Your husband is an absolute narc lmao", "YWNBTA, but the bigger issue is your husband deleting those photos. Your husband shouldn't have private photos of you on his phone if he's going to show them to his friends just because he has a drink", "NTA  I personally would be horrified.", "NTA. That\u2019s actually a huge violation and technically a crime. You don\u2019t HAVE to be upset, if you\u2019re not, and you can forgive your husband but just know that in the eyes of the law your husband has committed a sex crime by sharing intimate photos of you without your consent. \n\nYou are well within your rights to make them feel really bad and awkward. They *should* feel really bad and awkward. They are grown men, not dumb teenage boys. They don\u2019t need to be sharing the intimate details of their committed relationships and they definitely don\u2019t need to be sharing intimate photos.", "Why would you even want to make this more awkward than it already is?

Why are you trying to make his friend feel awkward for something he didn't do?", "Agreed, unless the friend was begging/pestering him to see. If that's the case, an apology or something might be in order.", "Ok fair, good point.", "Ok fair, thank you.", "Yeah, thank you.  Maybe I need to dial it down.", "My sense is that it came up in conversation and he was very okay with seeing.", "Yes, absolutely.", "Yep, totally agree.", "Omg. That\u2019s hilarious", "Yep you\u2019re right, this is on my husband, ultimately. Totally agree.", "Kind of? He did. He also broke the law.", "Thanks. And yeah! I was relieved.", "Thanks. Yep, I do think he is sorry.", "That\u2019s fair, thanks. Those are good points.", "How would you handle it?", "How so?", "Yep, we\u2019ve talked about that too.", "How would you handle it?", "Yeah I don\u2019t feel upset to the level you describe.

Omg I like how you think! So creative.", "Ok thank you, good points.", "I like that idea. I want to keep it kind of light, give him a hard time.", "Imo it doesn't matter what role the friend played, her husband is the one that should have shut it down and deserves all the blame. If the friend instigated, why would he have done that? Did they do it previously and that's why he thought it was cool? Either way, the husband is responsible for his friend and his own actions (showing the photo).", "I\u2019d argue this is an issue between your husband more than you the husband and the friend.", "Well, in that case... either do nothing or go big and swan around topless while he visits you and your husband.", "Think about it this way: he must think you have a lovely chest if he wanted to show it off! \ud83d\ude02", "I get that you're not happy with your husband's actions, but make your husband sweat for it.

I\u2019m not going to *do* anything about it, but you guys know what you did is actually against the law right? If I was more upset I would be well within my rights to report this to the police and if convicted you would be labeled sex criminals. \u2026 again not going to do that cus I\u2019m not that upset, but you guys should know what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re doing it and be better.

He\u2019s proven he can\u2019t be trusted with them.", "YWBTA, but a justified one.\n\nIf you're past it with your husband, there's no need to keep the situation going.  If you make his buddy uncomfortable,  that sends the message that you're not as okay and forgiving as you've expressed, and that's just going to drag it out. If you're over it, be over it.", "Let it go... but I would make a point that now you have to see his d\\*\\*\\* pic... hihi...", "I wouldn't harp on it. Your husband was clearly upset and feels remorse. The fact that his friend also wants to apologize speaks volumes. I would let it go and let them apologize, and then when the dust settles and everything seems OK, then you can give them some lighthearted ribbing.", "This is the most whipped beta of all time.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is just polite. He did nothing wrong to you. He is just doing this to help your husband. And it is working very well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only one who did  anything to you was your husband. But they are very good in deflecting ... you have already forgiven your husband and are focussing on the innocent friend.", "Yeah, I would tell my hubs that to make this right we'll both go through his phone, computer and any storage and delete any nude photos together. Appreciate the honestly but you lose the privilege. Especially if he's that immature. Don't worry about the friend.", "Plus will the friend go around to others saying he's seen your boobs. That's a big ick  for me. I might tell my hubs to tell his friend he owes you a topless pic of his wife. How does that feel? How would she feel? Still it's a immature hubs issue, the friend wasn't holding a gun to his head. Watch him delete any 'personal' photos of you.", "I don\u2019t know! Just want to kind of give him a hard time.", "Haha! Seriously?", "Ok. Any suggestions?", "You\u2019ve handled it well so far; keep the moral high ground, give the friend a hard stare and leave it at that.\n\nPerhaps try and get breakfast in bed out of it for a week or so though ;-)", "Your husband feels shitty and you're uncertain about the friend's motivation in apologizing. There's something therapists call \"holding the silence\". You can hold the silence in the conversation, let him fill the gaps, just keep making natural eye contact and nodding, see what comes out. It's about being neutral, not hostile, but allowing the awkward silence so that more words come out, to see what those hold.\n\nBUT it's worth remembering that your husband showed the photo, not him.", "Yeah, and marriage counseling, probably.  I'd need to know why he thought it was OK to share my body with someone else without my permission.", "It wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone to show your husband a barely there top ahead of time and tell him that you plan to wear it for his friend\u2019s visit. You know, since he\u2019s already seen everything. I wouldn\u2019t actually do it, though.", "He did something to violate you. He then told you, for no reason. He created his own problem two-fold and he can\u2019t live with his own guilt. THEN he tries to bring his friend into the problem that only HE created. Mans needs to keep his mouth shut lmao. No one would be any worse off if he was just quiet.", "Ha! I need something.", "And maybe do something jokey?", "Yes, fair. Just a little bit of ribbing.", "I came here to say this! If it were me I\u2019d answer the door tits out", "Omg. This is an amazing idea. And fair?", "Mmm\u2026depends.  I\u2019ve got one mate who\u2019s been paying an interest in my lady\u2019s bosom for the past 20 years or so.  I\u2019d not let anything slip there. \n\nIf it was a genuinely disinterested, \u201cOh my god what have I done? I\u2019m mortified.  Why did I keep drinking?!\u201d friend, I\u2019d have a bit of fun, but you\u2019ll have to judge for yourself.   But yeah, I\u2019d not be lifting a finger for a while :-)", "In this case, not letting it go isn\u2019t petty", "I think it\u2019s fair. Give him a little butt-pucker moment, just not a full on heart attack.", "Message me if you\u2019re comfortable? I have an idea!"]}
