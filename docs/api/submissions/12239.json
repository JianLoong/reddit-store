Don\u2019t back down, because he is as much their grandchild and your child as your two daughters.", "NTA-it appears you are not depriving your daughters of anything important. Gently remind your brother that abuse is abuse is abuse,", "NTA adopted kid here. I\u2019ve been blessed with a family that loves and accepts me like any other member. Thank you for loving your children and protecting your son like that. Heartbreaking to see how some people don\u2019t accept children for something they can\u2019t control.", "NTA - don\u2019t let them see your kids even if they do apologise.         \nThey won\u2019t really change.         \nProtect your children.          \nIf they can treat your son and wife like they have they could turn on your daughters if they disappoint them.", "Nta- how can someone be so cruel to an innocent child is beyond me. They're horrible people", "NTA legally your son IS their grandchild and to treat a 2 year old like that is terrible. I wouldn't want my biokids around them either. I'd be afraid they would say things like oh he's not your brother. Trauma for everyone", "I mean, OP, there is no question here, NTA. First of all, breeder fetish?  WTF, because you wanted to try to have another child, maybe a son?  That\u2019s a bonkers thing to throw out there and I wonder if there are other issues they have with your wife. We\u2019re they against you marrying her in the first place?  Is there more to that relationship?  Seems like maybe but moving on\u2026\n\nThey absolutely do not \u201chave the right\u201d to not acknowledge your legally adopted child as your child and therefore, their grandchild. They don\u2019t have to like him, see him, but they don\u2019t have the right to deny he is indeed your son. Why anyone would stand on that hill, especially your brother, boggles the mind. \n\nAnother question that comes to mind, Is your son a different race than your parents?  Maybe if they are intolerant of racial differences and your son is different from them, this could be contributing to their attitude. Certainly not a justification by no means. Just might provide an explanation. Again, it just seems there might be more going on, sorry if I\u2019m prodding here. \n\nRegardless, you are 100 percent doing the right thing. I went NC with my mom for a myriad of reasons when my kids were little. One reason is that she was very vocal about how much she hated little boys. I have 2 daughters and a son. I remember when she came to visit ( for the very last time) my oldest girl was about 5 and my son was 1 1/2. He was so flippin cute , I mean, of course they both were little adorable buttons ( not biased at all, and my youngest was too, but she wasnt born at this point in my tale.). \n\nMy mom would just flat out ignore him and lavish all this attention on my daughter. It was so obvious but he wasn\u2019t really affected. As I said, for many many reasons, I went NC because I wanted to protect all my kids from her manipulation. I am certain that there would have been damage if I had not kept her far away from my kids. \n\nYour son will definitely figure it out early in if they keep coming around and refusing to acknowledge him. Kids aren\u2019t dumb. It\u2019s extremely hard to hold your ground but extremely important to show that you stand by your son. He may not understand it now, but he will one day and will appreciate it. \n\nHopefully, your parents will see you aren\u2019t screwing around and will see the light. If not, i know it\u2019s hard, but move on without them. The onus is on them, not you. Speaking as a very hopeful future grandma, your parents don\u2019t have a right to your kids and certainly no right to abuse and mistreat them. Grandmas are for hugs and cookies, not judgment and scorn.", "Sorry, but your father is COLD. Not to even talk to a little kid like that??", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents disagree with your choice, and are doing this to \u201cpunish\u201d you. Except they aren\u2019t punishing you. The only person they\u2019re punishing is your son. He didn\u2019t ask to be given up for adoption.    He is innocent no matter how you look at it. So how/why does it make sense to single him out?\n\nYour parents views on the whole thing are horrific. I can\u2019t believe they actually said - out loud - your wife has a \u201cbreeder fetish\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what prompted your wife to forgive them for that, or for you to reconcile the relationship, but know this: when people show you who they really are, believe them.  Your parents have shown you, multiple times, they don\u2019t respect you, they definitely don\u2019t have respect or compassion for your wife, and they will never accept (or even be kind to) your son.  Even if you take out the overt hate towards your son, do you really want your family around people who blatantly disrespect you and your wife? Regardless of how good they seem to you as grandparents, they are not good people.  You need to consider long term NC with them, and possibly your brother if he keeps it up.  \n\nTo be clear - *you* didn\u2019t do anything. You aren\u2019t doing this to your parents. They did this entirely on their own. They almost lost their relationship with you once, and clearly it made no impact on them. This runs so much deeper than just not accepting your son and will escalate.  I\u2019m glad you stood up and protected your son. Now you need to stand up and also protect yourself, your wife, and your daughters.  This kind of hate has no place in your family.", "[removed]", "NTA. They can be upset with you but how dare they take it out on the child. Shameful.", "Nta.  Doesn't matter if u gave birth to him.  He is your kid and their grandkid.  U can die on this hill", "Absolutely NTA - they are your parents, he is your son there he is their grandson - until they can see that they can't see any of their grandchildren.\n\nCompletely fair - \n\nThe brother is a jerk for getting involved - tell him it's not his business how you protect your children.", "NTA. You are protecting your son and preventing your other kids from having prejudice towards their little brother. That kind of behavior will only teach your girls it's okay to treat him as less than.", "From the great Maya Angelou:\n\"When someone shows who they really, really are, believe them -- the first time.\"\n\nYour parents lack boundaries and empathy, and your brother supports them.      Continue to cut off all contact with your daughters because they will surely try to convince them that the baby \"is not really your brother.\"\n\nNTA.", "Omg. Imagine being cruel to a toddler. They're usually just bubbly and inquisitive and to just walk away rather than engage is horrible. \n\nNTA protect all three of your babies. If let this fester your older two might have picked up on it and started treating your youngest differently. This method will protect their sibling relationships.", "NTA\n\nAll or none. Their choice. There is no reason to hurt a little boy because your genetics are missing. I hope you told your brother that goes for him too. That child belongs to your family now. Your parents are being cruel and I absolutely would not allow it.\n\nInfo: is your son a different race? I'm trying to wrap my head around how someone could be so heartless", "NTA\n\nIf you ignore the fact that they're relatives, do you really want people who would treat a child like that around any of your children?", "I adore you both. The fact they can be so heartless to a child, their grandchild, is disgusting. And for them to say that about your wife, it's beyond vile.\n\nYour brother can F off. And personally, I would cut them all out of your life. That's a level of toxic that no one should ever deal with.\n\nPositively NTA.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up for your children. People who treat adopted kids as any less are truly TA, and it might be good to reconsider your relationship with your parents and brother. Children will always remember the rejection", "NTA. \n\nIn a funny way, your BIL is partially right: your grandparents do have the right to choose whether or not to consider your son their grandson. But that does not free them from the entirely reasonable consequence of being banned from seeing any of the children at all. And if anything, I would limit the influence they have if this is how they act when they don\u2019t like something. \n\nFAFO. The choice you have presented them with is reasonable.", "NTA, as an adopted child myself; this really breaks my heart that your parents are so terrible.", "NTA. your daughters would be ill served to be the golden children to your son's scapegoat\n\nps also your brother sucks hard", "NTA.  Good for you!! Your son is a toddler now, but one day will struggle being treated differently.", "And it's your right to consider them grandparents or not.  They don't deserve to be called ones.\n\nNTA.\nProtect your kids no matter what.", "NTA. He\u2019s right, it\u2019s their right to be or not to be a grandparent to you son, just as it\u2019s your right to cut ties with them over it. Your son is your son, full stop. To go hide in a room because a toddler tried talking to you is ridiculous and just shows how awful your parents are. Honestly y w y b t a if you continue to subject your wife and son to their cruelty. Your daughters may love their grandparents but I bet if they could grasp that their grandparents don\u2019t love their little brother they\u2019d want nothing to do with them either.", "Yup, it's their right to be cruel to be cruel to a tiny child, you betcha.  And it's your right to go NC with people who hurt your kid and don't treat all of your kids equally.\n\nNTA", "Holy crap. NTA and this is the sort of thing that would cause me to go no contact. My husband went NC with his mother because she refused to even acknowledge the existence (to her face even) of my 3yr old daughter (my husbands step daughter he raised as his own) I don\u2019t see how anyone could continue a relationship with people who would punish a small child like this.", "... and don't forget about their flying monkey, your brother.", "Biogrands are moral defectives and thus represent extremely poor role models for all your children.
