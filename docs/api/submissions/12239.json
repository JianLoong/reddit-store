They have the best relationship with our daughters.

Honestly, cutting them off completely is not too far, this behavior is fucked up.", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely doing the right thing. It would be very unhealthy for the girls to see their brother shunned in their favor and of course it would be devastating to your son.", "Tell your brother you are also free to associate with whomever you want and you won't be bringing your kids around these people. It's hilarious how people don't seem to see their logical works both ways", "You sound like a good father. Keep it up.", "NTA.  Your parents (and brother) are being horrible.

Imagine how this would affect your youngest if you let this continue. Your parents would continue to deny his existence and withhold affection and attention while doting on your daughters.

It's not their right to choose who they want as their grandchild.", "NTA \n\nAdopted children should be treated just like biological children, and you're doing the right thing in sticking up for your son.  Your parents and brother are major AHs for summarily rejecting your son, on top of that nasty crack about breeders, and tolerating that kind of grossly disparate treatment would likely have all sorts of bad effects upon all your children.   You're not being unfair to your children, but rather, protecting all of them from some pretty toxic attitudes- in your position, I'd be contemplating going NC with the parents and brother.", "NTA.

They don't recognize your son as their grandchild, that's their choice, they have the freedom to make such a choice.

Your all or nothing approach is the correct one.", "I think if you explained to your daughters that grandpa and grandma don't want to love baby brother, and want to be unfair to him.
