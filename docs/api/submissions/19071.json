A lot of other things happened but here is the big one!\n\nMIL was telling the whole extended family she wanted them at our rehearsal dinner. Had to constantly remind her that there was a 30 person limit and a rehearsal dinner is not a second wedding. This caused issues with her brother \u201cJohn\u201d and his wife \u201cLaura\u201d because as \u201cgodparents\u201d they \u201cdeserved\u201d to be there. Husband told them they were welcome as we needed someone to bring grandma. John declined as he didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctied down\u201d. MIL assured us he knew that meant we\u2019d have to invite someone else in his place but I had doubts still.\n\nTurns out I was right and John and Laura lose it when they find out they aren\u2019t invited a few days before our wedding. I go to bat for MIL because I knew she was stressed about it all. Wasn\u2019t happy because I warned this would happen and it added stress just a few days out but I figured the best way to solve it was pretty kindly explain things myself.\n\nJohn and Laura decide my level of \u201cdisrespect\u201d warranted flipping me off during my father daughter dance, scowling at all cameras, and sending their two kids (24f and 21f) to scream at me throughout the night. Despite this MIL and husband refuse to kick them out as it will only cause a scene and make things worse.\n\nAfter our wedding, I tell MIL that this all hurt me and I\u2019m sad she wouldn\u2019t go to bat for me especially when I did for her. She says she will correct everything with the family.\n\nMIL has yet to correct this issue with the extended family and believes I should let it go. At Thanksgiving, it was clear there is a lot of resentment towards me as the entire extended family has only heard John and Laura\u2019s side of things and sided with them.\n\nHusband and I agree that we don\u2019t need to go to extended family events anymore, so I decided to set this boundaries with MIL. MIL asks if I\u2019ll still go to holidays and vacations. I say yes to holidays with immediate family only (no extended family) but am not sure about vacations since I am still hurt by the lack of support and need some space.\n\nHusband says I took it too far telling MIL that and causing her to feel like she is \u201closing us\u201d. He thinks the only people I can hold a grudge on are John and Laura and that we will still go to some extended family events. I don\u2019t see how I can go to future family events and act normal knowing people think I\u2019m terrible and my MIL doesn\u2019t think being treated like that at my wedding is that serious despite me saying how much it hurt me. I think it\u2019s fair to want space and set boundaries.\n\nAITA for limiting time with my MIL after I got flipped off during my father daughter dance?\n\nEdit: husband did apologize for not supporting me and promises to do better in the future.

And also has yet to fix the situation with the extended family with nearly 10 months of time to do so.", "NTA, Your MIL left you to fend for yourself despite the fact you stood up for her, she hasn\u2019t tried to make things right after forcing all this on you. She\u2019s worried about \u201closing you\u201d, is aware of how to fix the situation, but won\u2019t. She brought this on herself and you shouldn\u2019t have to bend over backwards to accommodate somebody who has betrayed your trust.", "NTA. The fact here is that you MIL doesn\u2019t want to stand up to her brother and his wife, so she\u2019s telling you to just accept the hatred of an entire side of her family. They behaved like monsters and ran the risk of ruining your wedding because she didn\u2019t have enough of a spine to tell him to knock it off or get out, and now it\u2019s run completely out of control.", ">John and Laura decide my level of \u201cdisrespect\u201d warranted flipping me off during my father daughter dance, scowling at all cameras, and sending their two kids (24f and 21f) to scream at me throughout the night. Despite this MIL and husband refuse to kick them out as it will only cause a scene and make things worse.\n\nThis is so cringeworthy, I have second hand embarassment from reading this.\n\nYou married into a family that has probably been on Jerry Springer.  I cannot fathom people acting like this at a wedding.  Your husband is a bit soft too, Id be furious if I were him.  Im aghast reading this.  NTA.  This family is not in your corner and they have some strange ideas about entitlement and public behavior", "ESH but mostly your husband. Your husband invited them to the dinner, but somehow it's between you and your MIL to disinvite them. Your husband didn't want to kick anyone out of the wedding, so it doesn't matter how your MIL felt about it. It sucks your MIL won't try to smooth things over with the rest of your family, but it's your husband's family too, and he's not doing anything to help either. That whole family is a dramatic swarm of bees, and you're an asshole because you're blaming all of it on your MIL instead of taking a good hard look at who you're married to.", "NTA but your husband is for not supporting you and trying to rug sweep.  If my husband's relatives or friends ever did that, it would be the last contact they ever had with us.  Your hubby needs to grow a spine", "ESH, The whole invitation and then rescinding the invite situation seems like a massive miscommunication on both parities. A conditional invite should explicitly clear, and I could see how close family members may have thought they were still invited and finding out only a few days before would lead to trouble in any scenario. Their behavior was still unacceptable though and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely in the right to set boundaries with your MIL when it comes to extended family events, but doing it for vacations doesn\u2019t make sense imo. If you\u2019re still feeling this frustrated it may be time for another discussion with your MIL to make sure she really understands your feelings", "NTA. She promised she would deal with it. She has chosen not to. That is a major breach of trust on her part. Why should you want to spend time with people who so lightly break your trust and expect you to just suck it up?  Tell (don't discuss) your husband that while he has every right to go on vacations with his family and attend family events you have every right to decide who, when and where you will spend time with---and NOT spend time with. He married you, not his mother.", "NTA but the fact that your husband wasn't backing you up before and after the wedding is a bad omen. If this isn't nipped in the bud now you're in for a short marriage or a miserable one. You also need to learn to set boundaries for yourself. It's good to know when to keep the peace but it is equally beneficial to know when to knock everything over.", "INFO \n\n>Husband told them they were welcome as we needed someone to bring grandma. John declined as he didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctied down\u201d. MIL assured us he knew that meant we\u2019d have to invite someone else in his place but I had doubts still.\n\nYou husband invited them and neither of you disinvited them. Your MIL made an assumption but neither you or your husband disinvited them. Why not? If your husband can invite them you have their contact info. So what happened is they were invited and never disinvited. In your defense John apparently declined the invite. Or he declined being responsible for the grandmother. \n\nWhy are John, his wife, and adult children focusing on you and not your husband? Your MIL isn't the problem your husband is. He didn't kick them out out, defend you, or stop the behavior and he still hasn't. John and family behaved like AH and are in the wrong.", "NTA. She promised she would deal with it.

She was smart and let it go to avoid a worse outcome.  You have every right to avoid John but blaming MIL an the rest of the family is ridiculous.  Also, you did rescind an invitation that your husband made to John.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
