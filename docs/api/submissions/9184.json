They disapproved because he was dating someone 2 decades older than him at 21. I understand why that would concern family.

They were cut out when they advanced to straight up harassment. \n\nMaybe they thought someday brother would realize they were right and come back and apologize.

This wasn\u2019t your brothers wishes it was yours but I think personally it\u2019s just continuing the shitty ness that\u2019s happened in your family.  Why not encourage some healing and let them come and know how much brother was loved?  I say all this because I found out recently that my ex step mom died.  When she divorced my dad she said to me \u201cI\u2019m divorcing you too\u201d. Which was hurtful and shitty from someone you used to call mom.  We\u2019dhad absolutely no contact but she somehow found it important to leave it in her will to not tell anyone in her family including my half siblings; her biological children(!!!!) that she\u2019d died for six months.  That\u2019s just spiteful and shitty.  Soft YTA in my opinion.", "NTA", "NTA\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Your brother would have been happy with how you handled it and that you are there for Liam. I can't imagine how Liam is feeling too now being widowed twice. You were your brother's one true constant in his life.", "NTA for not inviting them but I do think it was kinda shitty not to tell them about his passing. Even if you waited until after the funeral so they wouldn't have the opportunity to crash it. Letting them just find out a direct family member died from a Facebook post sucks.", " PES to", "NTA - you were the only one in your family to support him and his husband. They're just embarrassed that they can't say why they weren't there. Just keep supporting Liam - he's a widower twice. My cousin's partner was too.", "NTA. I understand being concerned about a sibling being in a relationship with a much older person, but after that person has proved themself to be a loving and positive presence in their sibling\u2019s life, they can either accept their happiness or be dicks about it. They chose to be dicks. It\u2019s sad for them that they never got the chance to reconcile, but that was the result of their actions and not your fault or responsibility.", "> Then with no real information decide Liam is a predator \n\nLiam was 42 year old in a relationship with a troubled 21 year old.\n\nIf OPs brother had been a woman noone in here would be saying that.", "If there was a cease and desist order filled then they would only be allowed to contact Liam through the lawyer I believe.", "Not necessarily. It would largely be dependent on the circumstances. \n\nIf Liam was a 42 year old with a history of dating troubled 21 year olds and treated him like there was an obvious power imbalance, yeah sure, maybe it would raise my eyebrows. \n\nBut he was a 42 year old man who had recently lost what I\u2019m assuming to be a long term spouse and treated the troubled 21 year old with care and concern. That doesn\u2019t scream \u201cpredator\u201d to me.", "I would. I'd be saying mind your own damn business what two consenting adults do, be they male or female. You have no right to judge. And this whole obsession with age gaps in adult relationships is really harmful because it trivializes actual victims of grooming or predators.", "They are bigots because they thought it was inappropriate for a 42 year old to have a relationship with a 21 year old who was battling mental illness? \n\nOP said the issue was with the age, not the sexuality.", "Oh good point I guess.", "empathy is a skill you have to practice to posess", "Agreed. Absolute nonsense. Concern yourself with actual predators, not two grown ass people. They could be any age. People can be troubled at any age. People can meet predatory people at any age.", "Seriously. You can express concern for a 21 year gap (literally twice the younger's age when they got together) but immediately going \"HE'S A PREDATOR\" is pretty nasty and hateful.", "NTA. You respected his dying wish (that you keep yourself comfortable at his funeral) and his blood family never bothered to keep in contact with him. They also didn\u2019t attempt to reconcile before hand, or ask that they\u2019d be updated (not that you would be obligated to unless your brother was okay with it). I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I\u2019m glad you have real family to help you grieve.", "NTA.  There was a C&D for a reason.  They made their bed by alienating your brother, and his husband long ago.  I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA at all. They did indeed deserve it. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA F*** em", "YTA. There\u2019s been enough heart ache.", ">From what it sounds like they had little to no contact with your brother.\n\nOf course they didn't:\n\n>C&D orders for harassment \n\nThey would have gotten into legal troubles if they tried to keep contact with him.", "Large age gaps are also more common in the LGBT community. When you\u2019re looking at a much smaller candidate pool of who to date, and you want to be compatible, relaxing some age guidelines helps a lot to make the pool a bit bigger", "It would be ok to be skeptical, but it was not OK to harass Liam to the point where he had to get no contact orders on them.", "NTA\n\nMy condolences on your loss.", "I mean the dude was a predator", "NTA", "NTA. You're quite the opposite of an arsehole. You're a shining beacon of support and love for your late brother, when nobody else was. Also, how heartbreaking for Liam to lose two life partners in this way.", "NTA", "Nope you were exactly right", "NTA they reaped what they sowed. I'm so sorry for the loss of your brother.", "ages are all you need. given the huge age difference you can safely assume his partner is a predator", "Whut? No it isn't. Grooming involves underage people and the brother was entirely an adult.", "NTA.I'm very sorry for your losses. (Mom, Dad & little bro.)\n\nOP, don't beat yourself up over this. You were defending him probably along the same lines as you did when he was alive.Little bro was cheated out of having his family of siblings nurture him into his adulthood. Losing a father at that age must've been tough. Not having your dad guide him into adulthood probably dragged out his grieving process even longer than it should have.Pat yourself on the back for being the one person who was there for him his entire life.\n\nIf you haven't gotten counseling since his passing, please consider it.You're alone now and probably grieving both the loss of your brother as well as your family.\n\nThey were wrong. But you will eventually need to forgive them so you can move on. Making an amends to them regarding how you spoke to them (not about what you said) would be reasonable. However, families are sticky to deal with under the best of circumstances and this is nowhere near that.\n\nYou'll want to be your best. As you were for your little bro.So I think it's better to address them once you've processed your feelings about this.\n\nA grief counselor specializes in this very thing.Good luck.", "Condolences. Your brother gave his blessings for his funeral as you seemed fit. And this is just the result of their own actions. FAFO\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NAH You planned the funeral as your brother wished; however it\u2019s unfortunate that your other siblings found out about their own brother\u2019s death on Facebook. \n\nThere are many strained relationships in my family. We generally prefer to learn about deaths in the family over the phone. What I think works best is to postpone public funeral announcements. That way the funeral can be held without drama, and estranged relatives can learn about family deaths in a respectful way later.", "What are you talking about? No."]}
