Your siblings sound basically hands off with your brother. Then with no real information decide Liam is a predator and start a campaign if harassment so bad a C&D is issued and your brother cuts them out of his life. They weren't invited because they were strangers to him by then, through their own actions. That's on them and it's their guilt to deal with.", "Funerals are for the living, you followed your brothers wishes, the living need to understand it's not about them anymore. NTA", "NTA. They didn't cared about their brother, when he was alive. Why should the do when he is dead? And it sounds like your brother didn't want him there. And it would be a bad situation for his husband. So it was okay", "NTA.\n\nFrom what it sounds like they had little to no contact with your brother.\n\n>They learned my brother's death after his death was announced at out home towns facebook\n\nThe fact they only found out about his death after it happened, on Facebook.

They're welcome to disapprove of the relationship but clearly they went too far.", "NTA. A bit harsh but nta. They did deserve it.", "NTA\n\nThey chose to not support him, so why would they think they have a right to go to the funeral?", "NTA, but if he had money, they're coming for it.", "NTA. My deepest sympathy for you and Liam. Its not easy burying a love one. You honor your brother's wishes. Your other siblings sound like awful people, I don't blame you for not inviting them. Maybe this will be a wake up call to change their bigotry ways. Your brother didn't deserve the way they treated him.", "So your 21y old mentally ill brother, with a history of bad decision making, got a 42y old bf and your family understandably voiced their concern.

Like why you cut them out of your life. Awaiting judgment because something more must have happened. Like how bad was the harassment? Was the courts involved?", "This is one of those times that YTA, ** but** I don't think you were wrong. \n\n\nYes you were TA, but they didn't care enough about him to be there in the 18 months he was dying, so why do they get to come to the funeral?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
