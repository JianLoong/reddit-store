It seems like your brother was entering very predatory relationships to fill the void of your father.

If no (and I suspect it), they never even had a chance to realize that he himself is more important than his love life. They never had a chance to reevaluate their position, make amends.

That helps no one.\n\nYou especially can't make these judgments as people who aren't even really close to him.
