My deepest sympathy for you and Liam. Its not easy burying a love one. You honor your brother's wishes. Your other siblings sound like awful people, I don't blame you for not inviting them.

Your brother didn't deserve the way they treated him.", "So your 21y old mentally ill brother, with a history of bad decision making, got a 42y old bf and your family understandably voiced their concern.

Like why you cut them out of your life. Awaiting judgment because something more must have happened. Like how bad was the harassment? Was the courts involved?\n\nEdit: you and Liam are not the AH for not inviting the family to the funeral. The feelings of the spouse weighs more then some family who hasn\u2019t been there for a decade. But you are asking if you are an AH for rubbing it inn that they deserved not being there. And for that I need some more backstory.", "This is one of those times that YTA, ** but** I don't think you were wrong. \n\n\nYes you were TA, but they didn't care enough about him to be there in the 18 months he was dying, so why do they get to come to the funeral?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
