At a certain point the music became too loud for my comfort so I waited in the bathroom stall until it was over. (About twenty minutes) When I got back to the reception I see that my seat was taken by an older cousin. There\u2019s no more room at the table so my sister tells me to go sit somewhere else. I don\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding so I\u2019m incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of having to go sit with strangers and also offended at my sister for not saving my seat. So I ask my cousin if she can move, my sister yells at me to have some respect. My cousin can sense we\u2019re all uncomfortable so she offers to move which my sister declines and insists that I go somewhere else, loudly asking in front of everyone, \u201cwhy do you always embarrass me like this?!\u201d On the verge of tears I go back to the bathroom. My sister, having been scolded by our aunt for treating me like that, texts me to come back and sit at the table which I do. However rather than just move on and enjoy the evening, I talk to no one and act aloof to anyone that tries to engage me in conversation. My sister asks me why I\u2019m so quiet to which I respond loudly enough for the whole table to hear \u201csorry I don\u2019t want to \u2018embarrass\u2019 you again.\u201d\n\nEdit: A few clarifications. \n\n1. The seating wasn\u2019t assigned \n2. This was a Middle eastern/Muslim wedding so the loud music and dancing was about an hour *before* dinner. \n3. This was the wedding of a distant cousin\u2019s son who I\u2019d never met which is why I chose to sit at the table with the cousins I was close with\n4.

Your sister also wouldn't stay in a situation that was so unpleasany it was physically painful e.g. if she suddenly had a migraine at the wedding she would leave.\n\n Its okay for you to have breaks at social functions you find difficult - perhaps next time plan an escape.

Also coming back to have my seat taken and told to go \"find somewhere else\" in a room with a load of strangers is triggering me just even \\*thinking\\* of the stress that would cause. I would 100% have walked back out to calm down. I usually end up just standing in the corner if someone takes my seat.\n\nYour sister was wrong in shouting at you for being embarrassing.

Well done you.", "YTA,\n\nNo one sits at the same place at a wedding and the fact you hid in a bathroom stall for a lengthy period, of course your chair would be taken..\n\nBut people at weddings change seats, pull up other available chairs, and rarely anyone just sits there in one place.. people tend to mingle, dance, go to scratch and itch etc.. \n\nWith soo many issues across the world lately, from social to neurological, I think common sense got a flying lesson and tossed out a window somewhere.. \nIt's evident people can't operate without it", "you really overreacted, wow. once the wedding is at the music and dancing portion there are no more saved seats.

You are a grown man acting like a petulant child, and yes, it is embarrassing for your family.", "YTA.  You made far too large of an issue and turned something insignificant into a huge deal.

Everyone chats at weddings, particularly when it\u2019s family. It\u2019s not fair to effectively block your sister from being friendly by refusing to allow someone to sit down. If your cousin moved there must have been an empty chair near your aunt or your cousins family, could you not talk to them? If all else fails you can always go to the bar at a wedding while you wait for your chair to become available again. Maybe ask if anyone wants a drink as a conversation starter", "NTA! Your sister is!", "YTA, congrats on making the wedding about you.", "Outside of your cousin who offered to move, ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult. Your sister is not your keeper. Put on your big boy pants and make small talk with people at a wedding: \u201cOh how do you know the bride/groom?\u201d And if you\u2019re not going to talk to people when they try to engage with you, they\u2019re not going to want to talk to you. \n\nYour sister is an a-hole for losing her shit over a simple request that was accepted.", "YTA - your sister, cousin and aunt were all at this wedding which makes it sound like a family event, I\u2019m sure you knew other people there.  Also, if you keep hiding in the toilets, acting aloof etc you aren\u2019t going to get to know anyone else", "If you're talking about the time when you're being served dinner, I think you're fine to expect to sit at your assigned table. The bride and groom purposely put you with people you know and you should get that benefit.\n\nAfter dinner is finished, it should be expected that everyone gets up and wanders around to talk to others. The appropriate response to your cousin sitting in your chair would have been to track down an empty chair so that both you and your cousin could enjoy everyone at your table.\n\nI don't think what you did was necessarily being an asshole. I think it is a young person not being able to think imaginatively about finding other ways to solve problems and I hope that you're able to learn something from this situation for the future. I encourage you to be less entitled, less concerned about your \"rights\" and the rules in the future, and teach yourself to be more empathetic. It sounds to me as if your social skills in general could use some work and you might want to consider why you chose to hide in the bathroom rather than hang out in the open when you moved away from the loud music. It is okay to be uncomfortable around strangers, but it is also something to work on. Even if you didn't already know others at the wedding, you also missed an opportunity to meet them. Next time, challenge yourself to go over to a table of distant cousins you've never met before and get to know them. All you have to do is say, \"Hi, I know I haven't seen you since grandpa's funeral, but I'd love to learn more about your family.\" Be interested in other people!\n\nThat said, your sister shaming you as she did only made the situation worse. But you calling her out for it after sulking for a couple of hours is not the mature way to handle the situation. And for that aspect of this story, I'll have to go with YTA.\n\n26 is old enough that people will expect you to know how to handle social situations better than you are. But we all have different upbringings and I understand that this was out of your comfort zone. I suggest you keep pushing out of that comfort zone in the future. \n\nAnd you might want to give your cousin a call and apologize that you didn't handle the situation better. People are extremely forgiving of poor behavior if they receive a sincere apology and you can undo any damage you did to how your family perceives you.", "YTA - seriously you can socialize and when you didn't get your way you sulked and couldn't bother to engage with people.  Your sister is not your handler she is allowed to have anyone sit next to her so she can visit and talk with other people.", "NTA \n\nI think a lot of people just assume autism stops when you are an adult and that as an adult you're able to function. \n\nIt sounds like you're on the spectrum.

I usually have some sort of soft squishy object in my bag whether it's a stress ball or a small stuffed animal or something soothing I can touch and fidget with without it making noise or being distracting. And a small notebook and pen so I can doodle or write. Doodling intricate patterns soothes my brain a lot, and you can usually find scrap paper and a pen anywhere. \n\nDon't sweat it, even the nasty comments here accusing you of all sorts of unkind things. They don't know you and it doesn't matter. In the future, set yourself up for success by bringing along items to make the experience more tolerable, listen to your body so you can self-regulate before you're at meltdown level of discomfort, and have grace for yourself as well as others who don't experience the world the way you do. You'll do better next time.", "Because they are loud assholes and assume everyone else is too. the idea the sister did nothing wrong is insane.", "The cousin would have moved too.
