My husband's family goes on a beach vacation every year about an hour from where we live.  They get one house, paid for by my in-laws and EXPECT all 10 of us to stay there.

They would ask.\n \nThis year, they ran a week by us, and we clearly said we would only go for a few days and didn't want to commit to a week. They actually never even confirmed with us that they booked it this year.  Now that the time is here, we said we would go for 4 days and everyone is trying to make us feel guilty.  My husband especially can't say no to his mother.  I do NOT enjoy this vacation, we live 10 min from the beach and are there all the time.  These are a waste of precious vacation days and I would rather do something much more exciting with my family.\n\nWhen we went last year, my husband actually promised me that he would not make this a yearly thing..but here we are.  I knew the promise would not be kept.  I feel that he never puts our core family first, and always gives into his mother.

As an adult, I\u2019m eternally grateful for how many vacations we took with my cousins, I\u2019m glad to be close to them (even though we didn\u2019t like each other at all as kids - truly did not get along - now we go on vacations together as adults to keep the tradition alive). \n\nDo you think your husband really doesn\u2019t want to go?

I personally send the wife on the vacations with the in laws as I enjoy the down time when she's away. Let's me recharge the batteries", "NTA. Another option could be to go for four days, but stay in a separate hotel/house. This has averted some drama for me with in-laws. If they insist that you share a single house, it might be more about control for them.", "NTA. No one is entitled to your vacation time! \n\nBut the main issue is with your husband, not your in-laws. \n\nNot sure how you work out compromises in your marriage\u2014but e.g., if you have X total vacation days/year, could agree that each of you gets to decide how X/2 are spent?", "Sorry, I'm going with YTA. Why? You committed to four days and not zero. You need to put your foot down. What would happen if you didn't go?
