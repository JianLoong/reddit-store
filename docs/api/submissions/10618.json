I have been cleaning my house slowly for the past week and half slow as it is hard for me to beat my executive dysfunction caused by my disability and also because I have a 13 week old puppy that had been causing messes that I\u2019ve had to stop and clean before cleaning up my own mess. Now to the topic at hand, my sister decided to visit but without notice she had jokingly mentioned to my other sister whom I live with that she was going to surprise me so she could see how much of a mess my house was (basically looking for a reason to judge and insult me). My Mum overheard this and messaged me so I knew she was visiting. Next day comes and some appointments I had got rescheduled so I felt I should notify my little sister about it. She got mad that Mum told me and then lied saying she was going to visit our Nana who lives in the opposite direction instead. I thinking I have the day to myself now goes to my appointments and only cleans small things like moving dirty dishes to the sink and tidying the bathroom. Who shows up not even half an hour later but my little sister. She immediately starts saying how gross dirty and cluttered my house is and then when I get annoyed says she is here to see my puppy who she hasn\u2019t met yet as I only got him a month and a half ago. She then even tries to give advice on how to clean my house like out a show on while cleaning or put a timer on. Both I had tried over the years trying to figure out a way to clean that would work for me and also things that wouldn\u2019t work for someone with ADHD as tvs make me hyper focused on the screen and ignore everything around me and people with my disability tend to have time blindness meaning a timer wouldn\u2019t work as I would either work too slow which would cause more guilt and not get a lot done or a get a lot done and stop cleaning any further thinking my job is done for the day.\nI later messaged her asking her in future to notify me of any future visits ahead of time and to not surprise visit me and lie when I ask and also how hurtful her comments were and the fact that she need to surprise me like I\u2019m some sort of criminal that needed to be caught in the act of being a dysfunctional mentally handicapped human being. She got defensive and said she just wasn\u2019t going to visit me in future and saying she could only handle me in small doses because of how annoying to her I am ( all her issues with me stem from my symptoms of my disability).
