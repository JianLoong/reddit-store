My mom gives her some money for this too. Because of both of the babies being home and crying, my girlfriend produces a lot of breast milk. She can literally pump for 45 mintues straight and it just keeps coming. Her breast size has almost tripled and she also eats lactation cookies so thats probably helping it some.\n\nWe have a deep freezer in the garage with all of the breast milk in it organized and other freezers for meal prep. My gf has always done meal prep, even before I met her, so I'm not sure what method she uses for it or whatever.\n\nI'm off today and wanted to make some cereal and asked her why we dont have milk in the fridge. She said all the milk is in the deep freezer in the garage. I said milk for adults not babies. For food and eating. She looked at me weird and said she uses the breast milk in all of our meal preps and cooking, and uses part of my moms breast milk too. So all of the muffins, pancakes, quiches, hell even the butter chicken has breast milk in it.\n\nI told her it was disgusting and the food needs to be thrown out now. She told me if I throw out any food she made I can find another place to live. I asked her to at least remake what has breast milk in it, or label what doesn't so I can eat too. She sent me a file with all of her recipes and told me I can go through and do it myself but she's not doing it and I have no right to be mad when she pays for all the groceries and does the cooking. She called me a few names too that I won't say here, but AITA? Who does that? Using breast milk for anything besides babies isn't normal.\n\nEDIT: Okay, she's saying she told me about it while she was pregnant but that I wasn't listening and I told her that the kitchen is her area and not mine and I dont want to think about it.
