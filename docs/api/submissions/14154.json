I\u2019m in 2 of the same classes as Amelia (19f). Amelia is a very sweet and smart girl but her family mistreats her. She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house. He doesn\u2019t speak to her except to ask if she got a job yet or when she\u2019s leaving. He also does things like, when it\u2019s his turn to take out all of the trash in the house, he won\u2019t get the trash from Amelia\u2019s room or if she\u2019s watching tv in the living room he\u2019ll go on the app and change the channel either to what he wants to watch or he\u2019ll change it every few minutes to annoy her. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to him about his behavior and I\u2019ve tried to punish him but every time I\u2019ve tried he\u2019s gone back to his dad. I tried to talk to his dad about this but he says that this is my fault because I didn\u2019t ask my son before taking Amelia in.

You have two toddlers and are attending college, so there's no way he's getting much attention.  Plus, custody is clearly split, so he's only there part of the time.\n\nThen you bring in a new person barely older than him, yet another person competing for his mother's attention, and punish him when he doesn't do things like clean her room.\n\nIf you don't fix this, you're not going to have a relationship with your son at all.  So I hope Amelia is worth it.", "YTA. Bringing a teen into your home is a risky proposition; and not only does it add another person to your family which adds to overall bills in your home, it\u2019s stresses the family dynamic. \nAnd did you even validate what she claims? Have you ever met her family? Or have you just gone by whatever she\u2019s shared with you which obviously paints her as an all around victim of a harsh family. Your son either senses something is \u2018off\u2019 with her, or, is uncomfortable around her for a reason.

If you want him to react maturely, you need to have a mature conversation with him. You can still offer Amelia support, but it may not involve her staying with you.

If he\u2019s just being bratty and entitled about this, then he\u2019s being an asshole, but there is another possibility. Your son has had to adjust to his parents\u2019 divorce; to his mother\u2019s remarriage; to two much younger young half-siblings; and now to a new indefinite houseguest. It\u2019s very possible he feels lost in the shuffle, and is acting out because he feels like he\u2019s losing his relationship with you. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s not being an asshole, he\u2019s failing to adjust to a turbulent situation. I don\u2019t think you were an asshole for attempting to help a friend in need, and I think there is something to be said for teaching our children to be altruistic. That said, people have to be in the right frame of mind to be taught such lessons, and his outbursts may indicate that he\u2019s not. This is going to require greater expertise than you\u2019re likely to find on Reddit to properly unpack, and I think family therapy might be the best course of action. If you discover that this is one adjustment beyond what he\u2019s ready to make, you may need to figure out a new arrangement or give it new parameters, or you will be the asshole", "YTA, and your son's life sucks because he is surrounded by enabled slatterns.", "ESH. As a general rule, it's good to consult with everyone who will be affected by a decision that will affect them.  You failed to do so; and while I'm sympathetic to the \"it's my house\" argument, it's also your son's home and he's acting out his anger at not being included in such a major decision. \n\nYour son, however, has made his point and needs to take steps to make the best of the situation.  One possibility, of course, is for him to move back with his biological father permanently or until your guest has moved out.", "Idk about this whole situation.

Do you not care that your son is uncomfortable in his own home? \n\nYour son has ever right to his feelings. He\u2019s voiced his discomfort and you ignore him and keep choosing a stranger.

Don\u2019t be surprised if your son goes to live with his dad and chooses not to come home.", "Even though your heart was in the right place, YTA for failing to consider how all of the members of your household would feel about a random stranger moving into their home for an undetermined period of time. One\u2019s home is supposed to be a place where one can truly relax and that is impossible with a random person living there all of a sudden. If a move-out date were to be established it would be easier to get through. I would strongly suggest establishing a cut-off point by which time she will be out of your home. Meanwhile, make a point to spend quality time with your son.", "YTA.  \n\nHe's not the ultimate decider on this, as it's your house, but you've introduced him to a freeloading person in his same age bracket who is now getting subsidized in the same way he is AND who he has to clean up after.  Expecting him to be fine about this is ridiculous.", "Your son already had to go through you adding 3 people to his household, presumably without his input. He already has to live in two houses, and may feel like neither is fully his home. During the limited time he's living with his mom, he has to share his mom's time, attention, and resources with a stepfather and two stepsisters, as well as college. Sounds like he's adjusted to all of that reasonably well.\n\nSuddenly, again without his input, you're spending *more* time, attention, and resources on a stranger, telling him it's his job to take out her trash, and telling him she gets to decide what's watched on the family TV.\n\nTo me the amount he is \"acting out\" seems very reasonable considering what he probably sees as a disruption to his life and a threat to him that he did nothing to deserve.

There's something deeper going on here, which sounds to me you're glossing over in your need to be right.", "YTA. You should have realized that this was going to be a delicate situation, because your son is already unhappy about having to share his house with your husband and his two half-siblings, and now you've added a fourth person he didn't want there! You needed to talk to your son beforehand, and you need to realize that your son is 16 and him choosing to go live with his dad is an option he has at this point. If you don't want him to go live at his dad's you're going to need to take his opinions under consideration more.

She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house. He doesn\u2019t speak to her except to ask if she got a job yet or when she\u2019s leaving. He also does things like, when it\u2019s his turn to take out all of the trash in the house, he won\u2019t get the trash from Amelia\u2019s room or if she\u2019s watching tv in the living room he\u2019ll go on the app and change the channel either to what he wants to watch or he\u2019ll change it every few minutes to annoy her. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to him about his behavior and I\u2019ve tried to punish him but every time I\u2019ve tried he\u2019s gone back to his dad.

WTF?!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Of course, I wasnt trying to combat that. Sorry. But at 16 he has to realize if he feels unwanted, he can say something. And if he doesn't want to say anything, the very least he can do is take the opportunity to hang out when given? \nI really doubt he feels unwanted, and more he doesn't like the new family dynamic. \n\n- feels unwanted\n-doesn't say anything about it \n-isn't interested when he IS wanted\n \nHe's almost an adult, he doesn't think the younger kids will be prioritized first? He doesn't think \"my parent is pretty busy, maybe I can make time to do something we'd enjoy instead of adding extra work to their plate just for me to not be interested?\" I'm not seeing how its making sense. I honestly feel like he's a bit of a bigger AH than OP. \nHe isn't putting in any work/compromise to help this feeling of unwanted-ness. I honestly suspect he expects OP to just give him all of their attention.", "He\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s bullying a vulnerable, struggling 19 year old for her crime of accepting an offer of help in order to avoid homelessness. He can be mad at his mom, but that\u2019s asshole behavior"]}
