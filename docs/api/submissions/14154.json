I\u2019m in 2 of the same classes as Amelia (19f). Amelia is a very sweet and smart girl but her family mistreats her. She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house. He doesn\u2019t speak to her except to ask if she got a job yet or when she\u2019s leaving. He also does things like, when it\u2019s his turn to take out all of the trash in the house, he won\u2019t get the trash from Amelia\u2019s room or if she\u2019s watching tv in the living room he\u2019ll go on the app and change the channel either to what he wants to watch or he\u2019ll change it every few minutes to annoy her. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to him about his behavior and I\u2019ve tried to punish him but every time I\u2019ve tried he\u2019s gone back to his dad. I tried to talk to his dad about this but he says that this is my fault because I didn\u2019t ask my son before taking Amelia in.

You have two toddlers and are attending college, so there's no way he's getting much attention.  Plus, custody is clearly split, so he's only there part of the time.\n\nThen you bring in a new person barely older than him, yet another person competing for his mother's attention, and punish him when he doesn't do things like clean her room.\n\nIf you don't fix this, you're not going to have a relationship with your son at all.  So I hope Amelia is worth it.", "YTA. Bringing a teen into your home is a risky proposition; and not only does it add another person to your family which adds to overall bills in your home, it\u2019s stresses the family dynamic. \nAnd did you even validate what she claims? Have you ever met her family? Or have you just gone by whatever she\u2019s shared with you which obviously paints her as an all around victim of a harsh family.

If he\u2019s just being bratty and entitled about this, then he\u2019s being an asshole, but there is another possibility. Your son has had to adjust to his parents\u2019 divorce; to his mother\u2019s remarriage; to two much younger young half-siblings; and now to a new indefinite houseguest. It\u2019s very possible he feels lost in the shuffle, and is acting out because he feels like he\u2019s losing his relationship with you. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s not being an asshole, he\u2019s failing to adjust to a turbulent situation. I don\u2019t think you were an asshole for attempting to help a friend in need, and I think there is something to be said for teaching our children to be altruistic. That said, people have to be in the right frame of mind to be taught such lessons, and his outbursts may indicate that he\u2019s not. This is going to require greater expertise than you\u2019re likely to find on Reddit to properly unpack, and I think family therapy might be the best course of action.

As a general rule, it's good to consult with everyone who will be affected by a decision that will affect them.  You failed to do so; and while I'm sympathetic to the \"it's my house\" argument, it's also your son's home and he's acting out his anger at not being included in such a major decision. \n\nYour son, however, has made his point and needs to take steps to make the best of the situation.  One possibility, of course, is for him to move back with his biological father permanently or until your guest has moved out.", "Idk about this whole situation.

Do you not care that your son is uncomfortable in his own home? \n\nYour son has ever right to his feelings. He\u2019s voiced his discomfort and you ignore him and keep choosing a stranger. I get that you wanted to do something nice for Amelia but you\u2019re doing it and the expense of your son. Don\u2019t be surprised if your son goes to live with his dad and chooses not to come home.", "Even though your heart was in the right place, YTA for failing to consider how all of the members of your household would feel about a random stranger moving into their home for an undetermined period of time. One\u2019s home is supposed to be a place where one can truly relax and that is impossible with a random person living there all of a sudden. If a move-out date were to be established it would be easier to get through. I would strongly suggest establishing a cut-off point by which time she will be out of your home.

Expecting him to be fine about this is ridiculous.", "Your son already had to go through you adding 3 people to his household, presumably without his input. He already has to live in two houses, and may feel like neither is fully his home.

There's something deeper going on here, which sounds to me you're glossing over in your need to be right.", "YTA. You should have realized that this was going to be a delicate situation, because your son is already unhappy about having to share his house with your husband and his two half-siblings, and now you've added a fourth person he didn't want there! You needed to talk to your son beforehand, and you need to realize that your son is 16 and him choosing to go live with his dad is an option he has at this point. If you don't want him to go live at his dad's you're going to need to take his opinions under consideration more.

It sounds like you\u2019re more priggish\u2026", "I was always under the impression that that applied to people who started dating when they were both under age, and then one of them became an adult before the other. Like a 16 and 17 year old dating then one turns 18. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine a 19-year-old wanting to date a 16-year-old. That\u2019s still a pretty big gap in life experiences. She\u2019s in college and he\u2019s not even done with high school yet. College students shouldn\u2019t be dating high schoolers (he\u2019s probably a sophomore?) An adult is an adult and since they didn\u2019t meet when both underage then there should be absolutely no romantic or sexual discussions.", "Romeo & Juliet exceptions generally involve a three year window.  We don\u2019t have those laws in California but consider statutory rape a misdemeanor when the age gap is three years or less."]}
