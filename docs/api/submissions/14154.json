I\u2019m in 2 of the same classes as Amelia (19f). Amelia is a very sweet and smart girl but her family mistreats her. She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house. He doesn\u2019t speak to her except to ask if she got a job yet or when she\u2019s leaving. He also does things like, when it\u2019s his turn to take out all of the trash in the house, he won\u2019t get the trash from Amelia\u2019s room or if she\u2019s watching tv in the living room he\u2019ll go on the app and change the channel either to what he wants to watch or he\u2019ll change it every few minutes to annoy her. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to him about his behavior and I\u2019ve tried to punish him but every time I\u2019ve tried he\u2019s gone back to his dad. I tried to talk to his dad about this but he says that this is my fault because I didn\u2019t ask my son before taking Amelia in.

Bringing a teen into your home is a risky proposition; and not only does it add another person to your family which adds to overall bills in your home, it\u2019s stresses the family dynamic. \nAnd did you even validate what she claims? Have you ever met her family? Or have you just gone by whatever she\u2019s shared with you which obviously paints her as an all around victim of a harsh family.

If he\u2019s just being bratty and entitled about this, then he\u2019s being an asshole, but there is another possibility. Your son has had to adjust to his parents\u2019 divorce; to his mother\u2019s remarriage; to two much younger young half-siblings; and now to a new indefinite houseguest. It\u2019s very possible he feels lost in the shuffle, and is acting out because he feels like he\u2019s losing his relationship with you. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s not being an asshole, he\u2019s failing to adjust to a turbulent situation. I don\u2019t think you were an asshole for attempting to help a friend in need, and I think there is something to be said for teaching our children to be altruistic. That said, people have to be in the right frame of mind to be taught such lessons, and his outbursts may indicate that he\u2019s not. This is going to require greater expertise than you\u2019re likely to find on Reddit to properly unpack, and I think family therapy might be the best course of action.

You failed to do so; and while I'm sympathetic to the \"it's my house\" argument, it's also your son's home and he's acting out his anger at not being included in such a major decision. \n\nYour son, however, has made his point and needs to take steps to make the best of the situation.  One possibility, of course, is for him to move back with his biological father permanently or until your guest has moved out.", "Idk about this whole situation.

One\u2019s home is supposed to be a place where one can truly relax and that is impossible with a random person living there all of a sudden. If a move-out date were to be established it would be easier to get through. I would strongly suggest establishing a cut-off point by which time she will be out of your home.

He already has to live in two houses, and may feel like neither is fully his home.

If you don't want him to go live at his dad's you're going to need to take his opinions under consideration more.

She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house.

They were told it would be temporary and one of them had to share a room with me. They were allowed to not like it and if it was too much for them and I sucked, I'd have to find somewhere else to go.

Your husband is a huge ahole.", "Slightly different but similar situation here. I can share with you my story which is from the child's perspective: \n\nMy mum did that to me when I was 18 fresh out of High school. I moved out at 19  because of it. It has since affected my life and saving goals and I went down a really dark path for a while there. I barely spoke to my mum for a while, cried constantly, felt unloved, hated my life and the shitty unit I was forced into. I could barely afford to live as I was in an entry level job at the time plus studying. Meanwhile this girl remained in my home rent free getting everything given to her for about another year before she got knocked up and moved in with her baby daddy. \n\nThe girl was a friend of mine, but by no means a close friend. The girl was impossible to live with and my Mum failed to set the same boundaries for her as she did for me, because of her 'poor mental health'. She got special treatment, gifts, I'd get home from work and they'd be watching movies just the two of them like me and my mum used to do. She'd get Christmas gifts too. I was expected to maintain the standards I was raised with e.g. cleaning and chores but this girl was held to no standards and everything was done for her. She left the house messy. I was working full time and she was unemployed and STILL she did nothing all day and I had to do everything. I felt I had no privacy. I was comfortable in my family and then this girl around my age was thrown into the mix, not to mention her room was across the hall from mine. She was a total slob and yes she had a hard life but half of the people I know had it harder than she did and they wouldn't behave that way. The final straw was her getting drunk and flooding our house by mistake. My carpet was completely ruined and because her bedroom was on the upper hill side of the house it didn't get even slightly wet. My parents didn't even get mad at her, they were just really sad that their new floorboards were ruined. My mum told me the friend paid the insurance amount but I honestly beleive that's total bull* and my mum likely just said it because I was mad and kept asking if they were going to make her pay the damages. And no my parents are not rich. We are very middle class. I ended up having to tell her to stop whinging and get up and fix what she has done because my parents failed to do so. If I had done that I would've been screamed at, forced to pay, clean up, etc. She just hid in her room.  \n\nMy life was pretty messed up as a kid and I think my mum liked that this girl idolised her as the 'perfect mum'. That's my theory anyway. They still keep in contact to this day and hang out and it makes me sick. \n\nBut the worst part though is that she didn't talk to me about it first, she just invited her without talking to me about it and it infuriated me. The only reason she came to our house is because I was the only 'friend' she had with a driver's license and she asked me to pick her up. I told her she can stay the night at our place, next minute my mum is consoling her telling her she can stay for as long as she needs to, and she certainly took us up on that offer. \n\nIt felt like my mum had chosen her over me and part of me will always be hurt by that no matter how old I get. \n\nTalk to your son before it's too late. Not that I spoke to my 'friend' like he speaks to this girl, but if he is being rude to her he clearly has feelings about it that you should talk through with him. Also make sure you're not making him feel like second choice because it hurts a lot.", "YTA - if your talking to him was motivated by correcting him rather than understanding or accommodating him then it\u2019s no wonder he prefers to go to his dad\u2019s.

The glowing terms in which you describe your classmate compared to the frustration you\u2019re expressing towards your son make me suspect that he feels similarly in some way here even if that\u2019s not reflective of your true feelings towards the two teens in your home.\n\nMercifully for me, our home wasn\u2019t really big enough to accommodate an extra person at the time so it was a very short-lived situation but having no fixed end date to it by far made the situation more stressful to me.", "NTA.

Or some creeps home?), but he offered her my room to sleep in and although she declined and slept on the couch in the living room, it was still pretty awkward having a stranger in my home. I didn\u2019t make a big fuss about it and was polite, but I also didn\u2019t feel like going downstairs at all.

While I was 19, and it was my parents house she was staying in, there wasnt any petty shit happening with my brothers, or parents or anyone who didn't like her (my entire family didn't like the girl) They just let her be, until she could move out, because she was having a super tough time.\n\nOP is doing the same, and her son is just being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole.

It comes down to the question is OP punishing her son because he disagrees with her or is it\u2019s because her son\u2019s behavior is unacceptable? For me, it seems like the latter. Sure, she could have down a better job explaining the punishment or having a conversation after the first day.

Even then, it sucks, but kids sometimes have to make adult decisions. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you an A H if you help someone, and I disagree to the fact that that girl is a stranger in the household. It wasn\u2019t like OP brought in a druggie or anyone along the lines. OP knows who this person is. How many times has someone\u2019s siblings brought someone inside to hang out or a sleep over and you never meet them before? Are you going to call them a stranger? She\u2019s a friend/classmate of OP. She sounds really sweet and a hard worker, and doesn\u2019t deserve what her parents are doing and what OP\u2019s son is doing. It sounds like she\u2019s being very helpful with OP\u2019s other kids. Yeah, maybe she can take her own garbage out, but OP\u2019s son shouldn\u2019t be taking the television from someone like that. I\u2019m like 90% that if he would have asked her for the tv, she would have given it to him after the episode she was watching or something. \n\nIt\u2019s not ok to take your anger out on someone.

And how dare you think you can make decisions about what happens in your house without his approval or input? \n\nLook, might things have gone over more smoothly if you talked to him independently about this decisions? Sure. Maybe. Teenagers have been known to be difficult and surly for no real reason. At the end of the day, kids do not get a say in how the house is run, and he can express his opinion, it does not have to be honored. That isn't abuse. It just isn't. And frankly, it's borderline triggering to me to even hear people suggest that, because I've seen adults that essentially will act like if they've told you what they want you to do, and you don't do it, you've basically spit on them and are a toxic person. I can hear you and still make the decision I think is right. Your son needs to learn this lesson. As soon as he learns this lesson, the next lesson is how to live with that reality without being a dick to others. Life sucks sometimes, you don't get what you want.

I get NO say?? \n\nAnd then all the same shit would still be happening. OP's son is being presented with a person in need, and his mom is trying to help. Either her son is the kind of person who can recognize that and put his own feelings aside and not be a dick, or he isn't, in which case discussing it earlier wouldn't have made a difference. She should have done it anyway just to be able to say she did. But plenty of people would have said YTA anyway, because how dare a child, especially a child of divorce, not get the thing he wants. People were dragging OP for making time to hang out one on one with her son, but only after she put the two toddlers to bed first. Because how dare she prioritize your toddlers' bedtime over her teenage son?", "What happened to Amelia could very well have happened to me. Maybe it had already been forever since she'd had an oil change. Maybe she didn't know that you can put off an oil change for a while (I wouldn't have known).\n\nI was in a very similar situation as a young adult and was kicked out of my parents' house for an equally petty reason. I would have been homeless if not for a family I'd been babysitting for allowing me to move in with them.\n\nThere's not enough info to assume that OP is getting scammed, and it's rather cold-hearted and uninformed to assume that she is.", ">Man. Love all the people acting like the 16 year old is a grown man,\n\nHe's not, but he absolutely is old enough to recognise:\n\n> the 19 year old is a poor little girl who needs help.\n\nShe's just escaped from abusive parents with next to no money. She needs a place to stay or she will be homeless. OP has a guest room and the son already has an entire basement bedroom+bathroom and isn't around half the time. Her presence barely affects him, he's being a little shit for seemingly no reason. \n\nOP is doing a nice thing for someone, and at the end of the day it's her house, she gets to decide who she helps out. She's offered to spend one on one time with him, he refuses. He gets mad, he refuses to discuss it and just fucks off to his father's house. The kid needs to learn some empathy and hope that if he ever finds himself in such a situation in the future, someone like his mother will be kind enough to take him in regardless of what their _children_ think of the situation.", "I went through something similar (though not as harsh)with my foster sister as a teen, took a long time to build the bridges again. \nEven if the parents are the adults and the homeowners, kids living at home are affected by the parents decisions and should be taken into account", "I desperately hope the OP reads this. This should be a top comment. \nAlso I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you; your mom sucks.", "It\u2019s extremely alarming that OP refuses to question why a 19 year old woman has no other friends or family to go to besides a 40 year old stranger she met randomly at college, and is completely comfortable moving into her home and being financially supported by her and her husband.", "So you\u2019re opening your house to take in homeless people? Or is the comparison only valid for other people?\n\nYes, being homeless is worse than living with other people. That doesn\u2019t change that the vast majority of people are not ok with having someone they don\u2019t know move into their house with no notice for an indefinite amount of time, even if that person was in a worse situation. Its understandable and perfectly valid for the son to be upset here.", "Not in AITA world!", "I drive past homeless people on the corner every day. You wanna take them in?", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think people are giving enough thought to this situation when they make the empathy argument.\n\nThere are a LOT of disadvantaged people out there, and people in abusive situations. To anyone making the empathy argument; would you be fine with the government finding one of these people, saying they\u2019ve vetted them to be a good person, and forcing you to share tour house with them? You won\u2019t have to buy anything for them - the government will cover that.\n\nNo? The same thing is happening to this kid. The empathy argument really doesn\u2019t work here when the people making it most likely would not accept it being done to them. Ironically, this argument lacks empathy for the son.\n\nYes, the son\u2019s behaviour is wrong. However, none of us are obligated to help out every person in a precarious situation we know about, nor to be happy about it. As adults we have the power to make the choice as to whether we will or not.\n\nThis is before going into the impact the divorce may still be having on him. He feels his needs are not being met, and he is doing his best to meet those needs in the face of his mother\u2019s opposition to them. Is his way of doing so right? No, but he\u2019s a kid, what do you expect?\n\nThe mother should realistically have discussed this with him. Not to give him full say in what goes on and whether she can move in or not, but to identify his needs, where he is struggling, and ensure those needs are met. Is he feeling replaced by his mother? How can she fix that. Will he feel like he lacks privacy? How can she fix that. Is he already struggling to cope with stresses of this mixed family and his teenage years, and is going to struggle more with the extra burden this places on him? How can OP help with this.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like any of this was considered. Her son was not considered as a person. His opinions and needs are not touched on in the OP at all, except in that he is saying his needs are not being met.\n\nHonestly, at the bare minimum I would allow the son to not interact with the new person in the house if he doesn\u2019t want to. Piling more work - whether chores or emotional work of processing this new person\u2019s existence and forming a relationship with them.\n\nAnd in all reality, OP has no obligations to this 19 year old. As his parent and guardian, with custody, she DOES have obligations to her dependent son. It is certainly very noble of her to try to help someone else in need, but that can\u2019t come at the expense of her son.", "Most aren\u2019t even remotely considering that not only has the OP took this girl in, she didn\u2019t clarify (or at least she didn\u2019t in the post) if she actually confirmed what this person told her about the family putting her out. And as you put it, where are friends and other family in all this? The son could be picking up on a vibe that\u2019s completely gone over his mothers head.", "But we don't know that she continuously disregards his feelings. This is one event where the parent did not ask the child for an input. Yes he lives there too, it's his home too but this was an emergency situation where a 19 yr old needed a place. OP can't say to her, \"Wait, let me ask my 16yr old and also m 2 and 4 yr old about what they say. It might take a few hours because we will have a family meeting.\" And then call her after 4 hours to say \"Sorry, but my eldest doesn't want you to live here for a few weeks so you can stay in your car\"\n\nWhat is wrong with you? If one event breaks your relationship with your parents, then....nvm\n\nAnd also, it was not like she invaded his personal space or anything. He has the whole basement to himself, she is given a guest room, is helping OP around the house. Why is he bullying her?", "IDK, right now the girl sounds a lot better to be around than her son.", "Or maybe it'll take 120! \n\nSlippery slope is generally a bad argument. But let's pretend it's not. If it takes three years her kiddo will be 19 and hopefully by then he'll understand that it would hard to be homeless at 19", "This. This is it right here. OP you need to see that this problem started before Amelia came along. She\u2019s close enough to his age, she gets to be there all the time, and he doesn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t a friend you\u2019re helping out, this is another child you took in. WTF? You don\u2019t see how he\u2019s feeling like you\u2019re replacing him? Sure he shouldn\u2019t be rude to anyone, but you need to fix your relationship with your son. This poor kid.", "For sure. Kids are savvy, they can tell when something is off. Also, OP is lavishing this woman with gifts and must be paying all her bills since she said Amelia had to give all of her money to the parents who still kicked her out. At the very least, from OPs comments, Amelia has a car that has to be paid for by someone, car maintenance, car insurance, college, phone, hygiene products, food - OP adopted an adult, and now that attention and resources are going to this stranger instead of her son\u2026 no wonder he\u2019s acting up.", "The focus immediately shifts to the son being an a/h and not how off-base Amelia\u2019s story is. Letting people into your home (even family) needs careful consideration and an objective exit plan. Neither of which is mentioned. She\u2019s basically become the responsibility of OP. And when you parcel in that his parents are divorced and he has other siblings, shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that he\u2019s pissed off.", "he has the entire finished basement to himself. He has his own bedroom, bathroom, and living room. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dpaij/comment/jf82r8w/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "I mean you can literally search up of all the times shit like this did happen to real life people lol. Squatters unfortunately exist. These are all hypotheticals anyways", "At 16, I had left school and started working and had also met my future DH. I did not consider myself a child by any stretch of the imagination.", "Doing the right thing even when it's inconvenient is still modeling good behavior. You shouldn't just do good, be kind or show compassion when it's easy or convenient. As long as Op doesn't have a pattern of choosing other things over spending time with her son it should be fine."]}
