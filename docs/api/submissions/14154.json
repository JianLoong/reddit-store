I\u2019m in 2 of the same classes as Amelia (19f). Amelia is a very sweet and smart girl but her family mistreats her. She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house. He doesn\u2019t speak to her except to ask if she got a job yet or when she\u2019s leaving. He also does things like, when it\u2019s his turn to take out all of the trash in the house, he won\u2019t get the trash from Amelia\u2019s room or if she\u2019s watching tv in the living room he\u2019ll go on the app and change the channel either to what he wants to watch or he\u2019ll change it every few minutes to annoy her. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to him about his behavior and I\u2019ve tried to punish him but every time I\u2019ve tried he\u2019s gone back to his dad. I tried to talk to his dad about this but he says that this is my fault because I didn\u2019t ask my son before taking Amelia in.

If he\u2019s just being bratty and entitled about this, then he\u2019s being an asshole, but there is another possibility. Your son has had to adjust to his parents\u2019 divorce; to his mother\u2019s remarriage; to two much younger young half-siblings; and now to a new indefinite houseguest. It\u2019s very possible he feels lost in the shuffle, and is acting out because he feels like he\u2019s losing his relationship with you. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s not being an asshole, he\u2019s failing to adjust to a turbulent situation. I don\u2019t think you were an asshole for attempting to help a friend in need, and I think there is something to be said for teaching our children to be altruistic. That said, people have to be in the right frame of mind to be taught such lessons, and his outbursts may indicate that he\u2019s not. This is going to require greater expertise than you\u2019re likely to find on Reddit to properly unpack, and I think family therapy might be the best course of action.

As a general rule, it's good to consult with everyone who will be affected by a decision that will affect them.  You failed to do so; and while I'm sympathetic to the \"it's my house\" argument, it's also your son's home and he's acting out his anger at not being included in such a major decision. \n\nYour son, however, has made his point and needs to take steps to make the best of the situation.  One possibility, of course, is for him to move back with his biological father permanently or until your guest has moved out.", "Idk about this whole situation.

Don\u2019t be surprised if your son goes to live with his dad and chooses not to come home.", "Even though your heart was in the right place, YTA for failing to consider how all of the members of your household would feel about a random stranger moving into their home for an undetermined period of time. One\u2019s home is supposed to be a place where one can truly relax and that is impossible with a random person living there all of a sudden. If a move-out date were to be established it would be easier to get through. I would strongly suggest establishing a cut-off point by which time she will be out of your home.

He already has to live in two houses, and may feel like neither is fully his home.

And I don't think this is an instance where if you give in on this one thing means he will lord this over you. There's something deeper going on here, which sounds to me you're glossing over in your need to be right.", "YTA. You should have realized that this was going to be a delicate situation, because your son is already unhappy about having to share his house with your husband and his two half-siblings, and now you've added a fourth person he didn't want there! You needed to talk to your son beforehand, and you need to realize that your son is 16 and him choosing to go live with his dad is an option he has at this point. If you don't want him to go live at his dad's you're going to need to take his opinions under consideration more.

She used to make less than minimum wage working close to 60 hours per week at her dad\u2019s business then had to pay almost everything she made in rent. \n\nAmelia needed to get her car\u2019s oil changed and wasn\u2019t able to make rent because of it. She gave her parents what she had but they still kicked her out. Amelia called me and asked if she could sleep on my couch until she figures things out. I said yes and she got here a half hour later with nothing but her car, her phone, and the clothes on her back. Apparently her parents didn\u2019t let her go in to get her clothes. \n\nI took her shopping to get some clothes, toiletries, and whatever she needed for school. We set the guest room up for her and I told her she could stay as long as she needed. \n\nThe problem is I have 3 kids. 2 girls (2 and 4) with my current husband, and a son (16) with my ex. The girls love Amelia and she\u2019s a great help with them. My son does not like having another person in the house.

They were told it would be temporary and one of them had to share a room with me. They were allowed to not like it and if it was too much for them and I sucked, I'd have to find somewhere else to go.

Your husband is a huge ahole.", "Slightly different but similar situation here. I can share with you my story which is from the child's perspective: \n\nMy mum did that to me when I was 18 fresh out of High school. I moved out at 19  because of it. It has since affected my life and saving goals and I went down a really dark path for a while there. I barely spoke to my mum for a while, cried constantly, felt unloved, hated my life and the shitty unit I was forced into. I could barely afford to live as I was in an entry level job at the time plus studying. Meanwhile this girl remained in my home rent free getting everything given to her for about another year before she got knocked up and moved in with her baby daddy. \n\nThe girl was a friend of mine, but by no means a close friend. The girl was impossible to live with and my Mum failed to set the same boundaries for her as she did for me, because of her 'poor mental health'. She got special treatment, gifts, I'd get home from work and they'd be watching movies just the two of them like me and my mum used to do. She'd get Christmas gifts too. I was expected to maintain the standards I was raised with e.g. cleaning and chores but this girl was held to no standards and everything was done for her. She left the house messy. I was working full time and she was unemployed and STILL she did nothing all day and I had to do everything. I felt I had no privacy. I was comfortable in my family and then this girl around my age was thrown into the mix, not to mention her room was across the hall from mine. She was a total slob and yes she had a hard life but half of the people I know had it harder than she did and they wouldn't behave that way. The final straw was her getting drunk and flooding our house by mistake. My carpet was completely ruined and because her bedroom was on the upper hill side of the house it didn't get even slightly wet. My parents didn't even get mad at her, they were just really sad that their new floorboards were ruined. My mum told me the friend paid the insurance amount but I honestly beleive that's total bull* and my mum likely just said it because I was mad and kept asking if they were going to make her pay the damages. And no my parents are not rich. We are very middle class. I ended up having to tell her to stop whinging and get up and fix what she has done because my parents failed to do so. If I had done that I would've been screamed at, forced to pay, clean up, etc. She just hid in her room.  \n\nMy life was pretty messed up as a kid and I think my mum liked that this girl idolised her as the 'perfect mum'. That's my theory anyway. They still keep in contact to this day and hang out and it makes me sick. \n\nBut the worst part though is that she didn't talk to me about it first, she just invited her without talking to me about it and it infuriated me. The only reason she came to our house is because I was the only 'friend' she had with a driver's license and she asked me to pick her up. I told her she can stay the night at our place, next minute my mum is consoling her telling her she can stay for as long as she needs to, and she certainly took us up on that offer. \n\nIt felt like my mum had chosen her over me and part of me will always be hurt by that no matter how old I get. \n\nTalk to your son before it's too late. Not that I spoke to my 'friend' like he speaks to this girl, but if he is being rude to her he clearly has feelings about it that you should talk through with him. Also make sure you're not making him feel like second choice because it hurts a lot.", "YTA - if your talking to him was motivated by correcting him rather than understanding or accommodating him then it\u2019s no wonder he prefers to go to his dad\u2019s.

The glowing terms in which you describe your classmate compared to the frustration you\u2019re expressing towards your son make me suspect that he feels similarly in some way here even if that\u2019s not reflective of your true feelings towards the two teens in your home.\n\nMercifully for me, our home wasn\u2019t really big enough to accommodate an extra person at the time so it was a very short-lived situation but having no fixed end date to it by far made the situation more stressful to me.", "NTA.

Or some creeps home?), but he offered her my room to sleep in and although she declined and slept on the couch in the living room, it was still pretty awkward having a stranger in my home. I didn\u2019t make a big fuss about it and was polite, but I also didn\u2019t feel like going downstairs at all.

I am sure that will work out well.", "Then if you have that attitude then you get situations like this.", "If a member of your family is feeling damaged because you\u2019re helping someone, then that\u2019s super fucked up.

There is nothing wrong with allowing them to freely speak their mind on things like this that do in fact affect them. Because if you don't, you're looking at a future of low to no contact depending on how bad it is. And you'll have no one but yourself to blame, considering you didn't view your children as actual human beings with personal autonomy and their own opinions on things, and instead decided to view them as tiny little soldiers who must obey your every order", "Cut her off for putting him in a situation where he\u2019s uncomfortable and spending more time with someone who\u2019s practically a stranger than with her own son in their home.", "You sound like my dad.

At that point whatever respect your kid has for you will be gone.", "Why is it every time a kid acts out it's \"they sound like a brat?\" No, they sound like a teenager who is upset and being ignored and isn't adult enough to know how to deal with his emotions. Imagine thinking \"my child isn't acting the way I want, so I hope he leaves and never comes back\" instead of trying to talk to him. Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with his behavior and the ex needs to have OPs back, but the kid is angry and there's a reason why", "Imagine proudly saying this about your kid lmao I sincerely hope you don't have any.", "Probably because he doesn't like being replaced from his perspective and just cant say the words because he is still a child.", "Exactly. Did OP have the \"right\" to let Amelia stay at place? Sure (barring any custody agreements that say otherwise). But it's not surprising that another member of the household, especially a teen, has an issue about how it was done, and it's not surprising that said teen now wants to go to his other parent's house, where he has more privacy and isn't constantly being scolded/punished.

That's what you're saying. He's acting out of line, he's old enough to use his words. Continuing to baby or placate young men is a menace to society. I have multiple of these types of people in my extended family. I've met many of them as grown ups. He thinks he gets to make the rules and dictate the terms of this.

If you think it is, then there's something seriously twisted inside your mind and you need some serious therapy.\nYes as a parent it is your job to raise a good human. Sometimes that includes actually listening to your kids, and taking what they say into consideration. Sometimes that does include giving your kid a vote on major impactful decisions that affect his life. Allowing a stranger to move into your home, would definitely be such a decision. It directly impacts his life. It directly changes things about his safe space, his home, the place where he is meant to feel complete security. If you take that away from them, don't be surprised or angry when they start to act out in response. Because you have taken away the very thing that they can't provide for themselves.
