He might have issues you can help him with but that gives him no right to act out on a person he needs to supportive of.

He's a parent now, it's time to be a role model to your kid. I'd maybe go see a couple therapist if that exists, it might help him.", "NTA.

Is this guy 12 or 21?? \n\nOP you need to insist he gets some type of therapy. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s available in your area or common, but his behavior cannot continue.  If he has issues with his childhood, and is using that as an excuse to mistreat you, it will not improve in its own. His behavior will continue and even escalate unless you take action now. Don\u2019t tolerate this continuing. Sit him down when your both in a good frame of mind and tell him things must change. And next time he screams at you or calls you stupid, pack a bag. I\u2019d say for good but that isn\u2019t always what is done in every culture.

Your husband, despite his own shame around it, has done that latter, and by constantly accepting his apologies, you're unwittingly enabling him.\n\nHe needs professional help, especially as he is about to be a parent. Couples counseling would also be good, so you can learn reasonable ways to shift this unhealthy dynamic that has developed in your marriage. \n\nHere's a three-step action plan:\n\n1. Insist on and arrange the professional help.\n2. Do NOT stand for his abuse (meaning you tell him in the moment that he may not speak to you this way and you do not accept his apologies when he comes groveling back to you, because that's a cycle of abuse and he needs to learn to control himself to not say hurtful things in the first place).\n3.

Again, that doesn't make it right, and you have every right to stick up for yourself or find a new relationship with someone who gives you the respect you deserve, but overall it kind of sounds like he's an asshole because he doesn't know how not to be, whereas you were an asshole just to be an asshole.", "NTA \n\ntell him he\u2019s about to subject his kid to the same abusive and draining childhood he had if he continues this behavior.\n\nStop tolerating it.

I\u2019ve been in similar shoes, however it was not a marriage. I stuck around far too long despite being constantly told how stupid I was and my ex-partner getting mad all the time.
