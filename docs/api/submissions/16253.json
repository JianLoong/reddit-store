Why isn't the elderly and blind cat put somewhere safe from the child? Yes, the child should behave better but if he's getting away with hurting the cat, then remove the cat before the situation comes up. When about the same age, I did annoy Timmy, my gran's elderly cat. Timmy was about 28 and had absolutely no patience with children or our puppy. He and Gran were good about making us leave him alone. \n\nNTA for your reaction but should have protected pet when he arrived.", "The child is beating an old blind cat and their take is that you should have been more lovey dovey getting him to stop? Your are NTA and they should never have that kid around animals until he learns respect", "NTA pushing away a child from a cat that they are hurting and may lash out at is what I would do as well. I hope your cat is ok.", "NTA\n\nI would have drop kicked the kid across the room. I mean, not really. But I would have had the same type of reaction. Granted I am childless by choice, so maybe that's a good thing. lol", "NTA- Ask them if they wanna pay the vet bill if the cat gets hurt, or the hospital bill if the kid gets an infected bite.", "NTA, and your nephew is lucky you didn't have a spoon of your own.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re right, he\u2019s just a child.

Yelling for the kid to stop would probably just have frightened the cat who was already in a stressed out place, and may not have had the desired effect on the kid, as they might not have connected what you were saying to their actions. The three year olds I've encountered haven't been all that smart and after a moment of \"Hey you made a loud noise\" attention they just go right back to what they were doing", "NTA. The cat is 16 and blind. Kid shouldn\u2019t be hitting any animal with a spoon but an elderly cat that can\u2019t even see what\u2019s happening? The parents should have been on top of that before it happened. Keep protecting your kitty friend.", "NTA - he has to learn that it is wrong to do that to an animal, as well as doing the other things to the cat.", "NTA, I would have had the same reaction as you!

As you said, it was an automatic reaction, so that's why I'm in between the 2.\nKids shouldn't interact with animals without the parents being next to them. For most kids, it takes a long time to learn how to interact with animals, and a 3 y/o definitely hasn't learned that yet. \nYour sister is definitely an AH for not paying more attention to the kid, it isn't just her kid that matters, and kids often hurt animals (also, if the cat was capable of defending themselves, they probably would've scratched him).", "I gonna say ESH. Obviously you sister for not observing your nephew and making sure he's respecting your cat. But if you knew that the kid wasn't being watched properly. Why didn't you set boundaries to protect your cat? Cats are animals where five of their ends are sharp. If the cat finally decides it's had enough and scratches your nephew it's on you for not setting boundaries to avoid issues. Either block part of the house from your nephew so the cat as part of the house to be in without being harassed or tell your sister to stop coming over.", "ESH\u2026\u2026He\u2019s 3?

Parents should be observant and proactive about their kids\u2019 behavior around animals. I draw a hard line with that concerning my own animals and won\u2019t even allow children to come into contact with some of my pets. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, and your sister isn\u2019t doing her job as parent. But shoving a toddler is out of line. If you\u2019d thrown your voice to startle him into stopping so you could step in and pick the cat up and remove him, that would be one thing.

It's important for the child's safety to learn how to behave properly around animals.

The OP does have choices that limit or even eliminate contact between the two.\n\nI fall strongly into the camp of not setting anyone up to fail. That includes my dogs in training, and it also includes humans. My nieces and nephews will never even meet one of my dogs (who is fearful of strangers). It would be setting everyone up to fail because of the strict if not impossible rules I would expect parents to enforce and children to follow. It\u2019s simply unfair to allow them around him because they and their parents would stand no chance of being successful. Much kinder to everyone involved for me to see the kids away from my home, without the dog in tow.", "I'm absolutely with you on this one.
