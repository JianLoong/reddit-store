I hope your cat is ok.", "NTA\n\nI would have drop kicked the kid across the room. I mean, not really. But I would have had the same type of reaction.

Yelling for the kid to stop would probably just have frightened the cat who was already in a stressed out place, and may not have had the desired effect on the kid, as they might not have connected what you were saying to their actions.

For most kids, it takes a long time to learn how to interact with animals, and a 3 y/o definitely hasn't learned that yet. \nYour sister is definitely an AH for not paying more attention to the kid, it isn't just her kid that matters, and kids often hurt animals (also, if the cat was capable of defending themselves, they probably would've scratched him).", "I gonna say ESH. Obviously you sister for not observing your nephew and making sure he's respecting your cat. But if you knew that the kid wasn't being watched properly. Why didn't you set boundaries to protect your cat? Cats are animals where five of their ends are sharp.

It would be setting everyone up to fail because of the strict if not impossible rules I would expect parents to enforce and children to follow.

I knew this dog that literally bit a kids ear off because he was trying to taunt the dog. Like animals have reactions, and they arent as composed as an emotionally regulated human being.", "YTA.

You could have just grabbed the cat, or maybe just taken the spoon.", "ESH all of you adults should be protecting the cat from the get go and teaching the child respect and gentleness towards animals, for both of their safety.\n\nYou did not need to push the child.

You know what I have? Photos of me being (a one of the ugliest babies ever, tbh whole (b being told, obviously, to be 'gentle' with the cat, as I am very clearly in the process of touching the cat, while looking directly at the person taking the picture. I don't even know if I was over 12 months at that stage, but I always knew 'gentle' with the animals *because people taught me* and I knew if the animal left, the animal was allowed to leave.\n\nNTA, if you can find a baby old enough to intentionally touch an animal, you have a baby that can be taught 'gentle' (unless special needs; some special needs people can't learn this and thus should never be permitted around animals, but most special needs people can learn this).", "Absolutely NTA as a long time cat person with 6 cats, I would have done the same thing. I also have a niece who was very rough with the cats sometimes and I\u2019ve had to scold her.

I made sure they knew that cats aren\u2019t always the best pets for small children. But they assured me that they knew the cat could scratch or bite the kids and they would handle it. And they did. When the kids irritated the cat and there were consequences the parents didn\u2019t freak out. They also watched the kids and protected the cat. The kids are now all teenagers who love and respect animals.", "He's three, you probably could have picked him up instead of shoving him.. He does need to learn that isn't okay behavior with animals. Your sister should be in top of this if she knows her kids track record and likewise you have to stop giving this kid access to your cat.", "Nope just  guide him and his parents to the door and tell them to not come back until 1.
