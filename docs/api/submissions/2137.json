On the other hand your wife agreed to keep the nephew when she knew she had to work so it wasn't great of her to volunteer you when you just got home from a work trip. I think the whole situation could have been handled better by the two of you with more communication and consideration.   \n\n\nI don't think you being in a separate room and continually going back to tell them to stop was adequate child watching, even for your own kid. I get you were tired but maybe pulling out a board game or something while you laid out on the couch would have been better since you know he struggles to get along with kids on his own and you left your daughter to have to deal with that. So yeah don't agree to something and then half do it and be mad. But also talk to your wife about not volunteering you for stuff without talking to you first.", "YTA for not saying no from the beginning, agreeing to watch the kids, and then complaining about what you agreed to.", "I know the first few times.\n\nThe first time, my daughter likes to hold the tv remote when watching TV and he took it from her and wouldn't give it back. \n\nThe 2nd time, I think he was messing with some of her drawings that are on the wall in the room. \n\nAnd the last time, he wouldn't stop making noises in her ear while she was trying to watch TV.

A 10 year old is old enough to understand \"I need to not be a little shit right now because an adult needs to sleep\". I have 8&10 year olds that I homeschool and spend half my time sorting out their disagreements and fights, but if happen to take a rare nap, those girls are absolute angels and only disturb me if they really truly need something. 8 year old is even ND and cries at the drop of a hat, and she manages. \n\nOPs wife is the AH, she never should have offered to babysit when she had work, knowing OP was going to be exhausted from his trip. I also have no problem calling a 10 year old an AH so yeah, nephew is one too, because he was choosing to cause problems by picking on someone smaller than him, instead of just chilling out and enjoying TV time.", "First of all, not my kid. I thought he wouldn't be annoying when I agreed.\n\n2nd I have fallen asleep and my daughter do absolutely nothing but eat snacks and play with her toys or watch TV. \n\nI shouldn't have to worry if the kid acted right", "[deleted]", "Or his parents should parent him and  teach him not to be such a trouble maker. And maybe this would have happened.", "So NTA.", "NTA \nAlso, You need to tech your daughter to set boundaries by vocalizing it. She needs to tell him to stop before she starts crying. This will help her in the long run.", "No didn\u2019t miss that but he still should have stayed up.

I think it would have been better if the wife asked before she volunteered and the husband was honest about being too tired to take the extra time to deal with a more intensive needs child.   \n\n\nI work with special needs kids, many of whom have social emotional issues that require more help when it comes to interacting with other children. I think it's great if Aunt and Uncle want to help and volunteer for that. But if you know he's a lot and you can't deal with it, just say that instead of sending the kid back and forth.", "My daughter usually does.

He did the right thing and stood up for his daughter in her own home. \nThere is nothing wrong with him setting a boundary that he will not stay at their house if he is going to misbehave and harass their kid the whole time. He got multiple warnings and chose to keep up his behavior the natural consequence to that is he goes home. And again if his parents want people to take him they need to work in his behavior.

And again this was known when it was agreed to watch him. I do think that he still has the right to take him home for misbehaving but the listed issues were annoyances (taking the remote, making noises, etx). It sounded to me like they knew he needed extra watching and interaction when they agreed to watch. But idk, still well within their right to take him home, it just to me never really sounded like he interacted with the kids at all. If I asked someone to watch my kids, I'd rather them just tell me they don't have time or will be too tired rather than just ignore my kid and then get mad at him.\n\nI also don't think he stood up for his daughter. He was annoyed that his crying daughter meant he couldn't sleep but he wanted to pawn off babysitting on her and the TV if he could.", "NTA instead of dropping your nephew off at your house your sil could have used this time to bond with him.

You say he was \"messing with her,\" but in your comments all you've mentioned that he was doing \"to her\" was wanting a turn with the TV remote that your daughter was monopolizing... so was there any other reason besides him wanting to share that that your daughter screamed and cried over..? Did he actually mess with her, or has she just been raised to throw a tantrum when she doesn't get her way?", "NTA if he isn't going to be nice to his cousin, he doesn't get to play with his cousin. Simple as.", "NTA. Kid misbehaves, kid goes home. Doesn't matter if you were tired or not. You told him to behave and he didn't. It is that simple.", "Vocalizing the boundary is well and good, but it doesn't do anything if the parents are oblivious or don't care.\n\nSource: My sister used to do this sort of thing to me. My parents never once acknowledged that she had done anything, or that I had vocalized a boundary, even though I did several times and quite loudly the last one.", "Meh. A boy who\u2019s constantly needling her lol his isn\u2019t going to stop just because she asks him to. He was in her house, what was she supposed to do?", "He mentioned he was there because his other siblings were at their dads and felt left out. So clearly his behavior is coming from that and that\u2019s an issue mom needs to deal with. \n\nHe set a boundary the child didn\u2019t listen and get the natural consequence for his behavior. I can only imagine that allowing it because he had some issue with his family dynamic isn\u2019t helping and is exactly why the child thinks it\u2019s okay to behave the way he is. \n\nThe father rightfully so was fed up. He was tired and he did what was best for him and his child. \n\nHe did state that he didn\u2019t think the child would behave the way he did when he agreed. So he wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with the child in that way. And tbh if any child was acting up and they weren\u2019t mind I\u2019d send them home too. Op isn\u2019t his parent to have to deal with it, his parent are. \n\n\nAnd lastly if his parent wanted him watched like that they shouldn\u2019t have expected someone who just worked a long shift to watch their child. And again a person who did not agree to it in the first place. He was put in a situation where he couldn\u2019t really say no to his wife without being an asshole. \n\nYour mind set though is a problem. This whole issue stems from the parents not helping this child properly cope with the fact that he has a different dad and will be left out and now other adults are having to deal with it. The only true asshole here are the child\u2019s parents and op\u2019s wife for taking a child when she has work.", "NTA. Your nephew is picking on your daughter. Shane on your wife for allowing it. I wouldn't let him come over until he learns to behave. And I wouldn't let your wife schedule your time for you either. If she's not there to watch him, he doesn't get to stay.", "Absolutely NTA.  This is a great age for a boy to learn that when someone expresses boundaries, they must be respected or there are consequences.  You taught him that lesson. This is also a great age for little girls to learn that they have the right to express boundaries and to expect they will be respected.  You backed your daughter up and taught her that lesson.  \n\nI have a 10-yr-old nephew who doesn't obey at all.  We reasonably regularly have each of his three siblings over but we refuse to take him because he can be dangerous (won't listen in a car park is a great example), and frankly, he ruins our weekends by being a little shit so why would we give up our minimal time off if we don't have to? \n\nI also don't think it's unreasonable to expect a pair of 10-yr-olds to entertain themselves for a day, providing there is an adult in the house in case there's a fire or a break-in or an injury/illness.", "NTA. Your wife should have been more concerned with her daughter being picked on.", "It's not about your rest it's about protecting your daughter from being bullied by him", "Ignoring the fact that the nephew was obviously harassing the daughter enough to cry several times? In her own home? You're not okay in the head to bypass that and think that's okay and not a big deal.", "Okay, so like I agree with most of what you are saying. My only issue with OP is agreeing to watch the kids and then sticking them in front of the tv. I still think wife is the biggest problem for volunteering him, but I just don't get why he even agreed. I would pissed if someone volunteered to keep my kid when he was feeling left out and then just went in a room and went to sleep and left them with the tv. And again I'd be mad at both wife and husband since wife is the one who volunteered. But idk, maybe that's why my dad is the only one who ever watches my kids because I mean I don't expect others to just drop their lives and entertain my kids, but when someone does volunteer to do so, especially under circumstances like that, I'd expect some level of effort to interact with my kid. Either way, OP probably won't have to deal with that kid again since it sounds like the sister is mad. I just think it could have been avoided by OP saying he was too tired to really take care of someone else's kid. And then if wife or wife's sister were mad about that, then that's just them being AHs.", "And to be clear I don't have any issue with him sending the kid home. It's just that he stated he'd watch the kids and then just went to bed. If he had just said no, sorry, too tired, then I'd be like NTA, he knows his limits. Or if he said he'd watch them and then you know brought them both to the living room to watch a movie together or whatever and the kid was being annoying and giving him a headache and he realized, nope, I'm way too tired for this or even just this level of behavior is unacceptable and then took him home, that's again fine, NTA. But I would be mad at him if he said that he was going to watch them and then only had plans to sleep. Like just tell me you are too tired to watch my kid. And sure I can get behind they shouldn't have asked him in the first place knowing he just got back, that's why I never ask my brother because he usually works night shifts, but I still think saying yes and then going to bed was an AH move.", "I wouldn\u2019t have ignored it after the first time. I would\u2019ve gotten out of bed & done my job as a parent.", "Per OP the \"harassment\" she suffered was....... she likes to be the only one to touch the TV remote and demands to hold it the entire time while watching TV, and her cousin took it out of her hands a couple times. Sounds like OP needs to teach her to share instead of screaming and crying when somebody touches an object from a common area. OP should never have agreed to be responsible for 2 children if he planned to sleep all day.", "NTA. I had a friend who used to be the Cool Mom who would gather up everybody's kids, and take them places.

She's not bothering anyone", "I N F O people have asked that you keep not answering: why did you agree to be responsible for 2 children when you planned to ignore them and sleep all day? YTA for that reckless negligence regardless of anything else tbh. Can't help but wonder why your daughter screams cries and tantrums when she has to share a single object for a single day with her cousin too; sounds like she's being raised to act like a brat .\"My daughter can do what she wants in her house\" true, but she'll be in for a rude awakening when she invites friends over someday and ends up shrieking at them and crying over them touching \"her\" remote lol."]}
