She cant give an idea of how long that will be.\n\nWhile living with us she has been an ok roommate, appreciative and offering to help with some chores, but is very dependent on us. I cook all the meals, even if I've been working late I still come home to both wife and her sister waiting for me to make dinner. She won't go out on her own unless we offer to take her with us. She is just everywhere I turn and I have a hard time feeling relaxed in my house, not to mention any intimacy with my wife disappeared. Wife and I are both quiet generally introverted people so feeling like we have someone we need to constantly entertain has been draining.\n\nLast week I brought my wife out to dinner, having to make it very clear it was just her and I, so I could express my concerns about it. Wife was largely on my side and agreed with the problems I've been having. She said she would talk to her about us needing more space, and that we would need sometime without her to try and reset and go from there, and if she would stay again setting better boundaries.\n\nThat conversation took place two nights ago during dinner. Her sister broke down in tears without really saying anything after. I thought wife was as gentle as should could be about it.

Wife mostly feels the same as me still, but did say she might feel upset with me if this permanently ruins the relationship she has with her sister. Her family is freaking out about it, their mom trying to fly in to try and sort things out, and definitely feel like we are being AHs.

If she has common sense she should know that she needs to give the married couple she lives with times to themselves. Your said wife was gentle in her approach. That\u2019s all you can do. You were honest and you asked for some reasonable boundaries. If that upset her, that\u2019s on her. You and your wife didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nIn the future, I suggest not letting family members move in. My husband\u2019s brother moved in with us two times. The first time he just stopped paying us rent. The second time he didn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t pay rent, and we were basically feeding him and paying for the stuff he needed. I got into a big fight with my husband over this. We were struggling financially, didn\u2019t have money for any extras, yet his unemployed brother was given money for beer. Hell no. My husband could not understand my point of view and thought that because it\u2019s his brother it was a-okay to let him live with us rent-free and not have to work. While in his late 20\u2019s\u2026\n\nNever again will family live with us.", "\u201c their mom trying to fly in to try and sort things out, \u201d \n\nThe fuck is their mother going to do lol NTA", "You're NTA but you need to be careful. A wedge between sisters caused by you can cause a wedge between you and your wife. \n\nFirst, let her leave, don't invite her back as long as she has a place to live. However, if she does have to return after her tantrum, I would set some SERIOUS boundaries with her first before things get started. For instance, she has to either order or cook dinner 1-2 times per week (if she can't, it should be her responsibility to clean the kitchen & do the dishes after y'all cook), has to clean all of her mess, etc. \n\nIf she sticks to the boundaries and takes care of her own shit, then it's fine. If not, she leaves.", "NTA. If your wife was gentle (you didn't provide much detail about the dinner conversation), then why would you be at fault? Your wife's sadness about her sister's reaction is, of course, completely understandable. But unless you bullied or somehow forced her to initiate that conversation, your wife would be unfairly painting you as the bad guy if she held you responsible for her sister's reaction. Your wife can't have it both ways. She can't agree that the conversation needed to happen and then blame you if her sister has gone NC.\n\nWhat I find very alarming is your MIL \"trying to fly in to try and sort things out\"! OK, now we're talking dicey situation! I firmly believe that in-laws need to stay out of these situations, but every family has their own ways. For myself, I would hope MIL's intent is to comfort SIL and, ideally, to arrange for an alternative living situation for her. Take care to \nhave your wife's back in case her mother says anything that is unfair or controlling of her.\n\nThe situation has the potential to become ugly. You can not control the behavior or those who want to insert themselves into this situation. Force yourselves to remain calm, fair, and united even if others become emotionally overwrought. The objective is for the sisters to come to an understanding and be able to repair their relationship. That would be tough to do in the midst of a family cluster fuck.\n\nEdited for grammar", "INFO\n\n\n>we would need sometime without her to try and reset and go from there, and if she would stay again setting better boundaries.\n\n>I have the sense her sister interpreted the conversation as we never want her around again\n\nHave you previously had any actual conversations (not just hints about her going out) with SIL about needing time without her, or is this the first time it's being brought up directly?", "I totally feel it. So, NTA\n\nMy criticism would be, though, that you waited too long and then got from 100 to 0 too harshly. Discussing the problem with her and then making a plan together on where she could stay or how the problem can be mended would have been my preferred way of action.", "NTA.  \nSIL is 24, not 4. She needs to grow up.   \nIt's a strain having someone around 24/7 and she should understand this. Your wife should make the reasons for your position clear and then tell her to stay out of it!", "NTA.  This reminds me of when my narcissistic mother \u201chad\u201d to move in with me.  She promised to pay the difference in utilities from the average. As soon as the bills came she said absolutely not, packed all her stuff and told the whole family I kicked her out.", "Mommy immediately trying to fly in to shield her (who I\u2019m guessing is the \u201cbaby\u201d of the family) is very telling of the dynamics here. The parents probably protected her from everything and everyone to the point that she isn\u2019t used to deal with anything remotely confrontational. Stick to your guns here OP, she wanna leave, let her. Enjoy your home. NTA", "NTA. Your SIL is too clingy; she should be able to entertain herself and go out without you. Both she and your wife should be able to cook sometimes.", "NTA. Your wife 'might' be upset with you is a concern. Fingers crossed their relationship isn't permanently damaged or she will blame you. You're not at fault for having boundaries. She is for that statement.  How manipulative is that.", "I guess NTA but why is your wife letting you work late without making dinner? She sounds as passive/dependent as her sister", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your *wife* needs to explain that you two have a marriage, and that yes, she loves her sister or would not have let her move in initially, but that boundaries are needed between her as a single student and you as a couple, and sister didn't seem to recognize the need for separation of the two.", "NTA", "NTA - It sounds like you handled it very well . .. and so did your wife. It sounds like your SIL didn't handle it with any grace or respect after having been accommodated by her sister and her sister's husband. Possibly she was just very embarrassed and felt like a burden without interpreting the situation in any depth. Just make clear what your boundaries are and explain again that it was fine for her to stay but that you needed some private time with yourself and your wife.", "For the people wondering why wife is blaming OP for this even if they both agreed, Did some snooping and i think wife is a Dom and OP is a sub so their dynamics might be different from normal. Still NTA tho", "NTA. I would think about asking the sister to get checked out for some counseling to make sure it isn\u2019t something like depression that\u2019s causing the issues.", "I'm surprised your marriage survived that experience", "Seriously. Sis is 24. But that's prob why she's like that.", "I don\u2019t think this would\u2019ve been a wedge between them caused by OP though. His wife agreed with him when he brought this up, and she took it upon herself to talk to her sister about it.", "Agree OP's not the AH, but how in any way was this caused by him?", "> *What I find very alarming is your MIL \"trying to fly in to try and sort things out*\"!\n\n\"Alarming\" is a good word to describe this behavior.  It sounds like MIL expects to fly in and set the *rules which will be obeyed*.  This whole thing is really none of MIL's business, but presumably she will try to be the final arbitrator in the situation.  \n\nI hope that MIL isn't planning to stay with OP and his wife while in their city - the better to boss them around.\n\n*(Wife).....did say she might feel upset with me if this permanently ruins the relationship she has with her sister*\n\nWhat a lot of nerve - this makes me huff with annoyance.  OP has already put up with a lot of BS from the sister.  **Wife needs to start wondering if her and her family's behavior has ruined her relationship with her DH**, the person she  swore to love and cherish.\n\nOP, it sounds like you have put up with more entitled behavior from your wife and inlaws than you realize.\n\nPerhaps a bit of therapy would help you learn how to stick up for yourself.\n\nNTA", "They went about it gently and voiced concerns. The sister decided to leave.  I don\u2019t know if she was hurt or if she is throwing a temper tantrum.", "Definitely not trying to diminish your experience AT ALL, but at least she left willingly.", "I was thinking the same thing. The wife even agreed with how her husband felt, but because he wanted her to actually say something (and considering it's her sister, she should be the one to talk to her) that makes the relationship tension his fault? Absofuckinglutely not.\n\nBoundary stomping sister + doormat sister finally setting boundaries = husband's fault. The math isn't mathing.\n\nNTA OP.", "The way she words it too. Like \u201cI might be upset with you, let\u2019s see how this pans out. Be prepared to be lambasted sometime in the future.\u201d  \n\nAlso, why is the wife sitting around waiting for OP to get home and cook? It\u2019s her sister after all. Why isn\u2019t she cooking for the 3 of them, or at least getting the meal started? What else is she leaving for OP to do, when she could chip in and help out? I guess the sister is pretty immature, but you\u2019d think she could cook a meal as a thank you when OP is late in from work.", "I agree with you. OP and his wife were gracious hosts. \n\nBut if we are being honest hosting guests long term can drive a wedge between spouses. You begin to feel like a guest in your own home. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOP is NTA. She is not homeless and has a roof over he head. OP\u2019s wife can take he sister out to brunch and have a talk woman to woman.", "I interpret the account as expressing the wish for an immediate cut.", "The post buries it a bit, but definitely implies she was asked to leave, not just give them space. \n\n\"we would need sometime without her to try and reset and go from there, and if she would stay again setting better boundaries.\"\n\nSo, yes, if they didn't make it clear before that she was being too clingy and needed to help out more and give them space, the sister likely felt blindsided. It's also unclear that she really has anywhere to go in the meantime, other than staying with friends or in a hotel for a couple of days."]}
