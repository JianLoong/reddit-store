If she has common sense she should know that she needs to give the married couple she lives with times to themselves. Your said wife was gentle in her approach. That\u2019s all you can do. You were honest and you asked for some reasonable boundaries. If that upset her, that\u2019s on her. You and your wife didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nIn the future, I suggest not letting family members move in. My husband\u2019s brother moved in with us two times. The first time he just stopped paying us rent. The second time he didn\u2019t work, didn\u2019t pay rent, and we were basically feeding him and paying for the stuff he needed. I got into a big fight with my husband over this. We were struggling financially, didn\u2019t have money for any extras, yet his unemployed brother was given money for beer. Hell no. My husband could not understand my point of view and thought that because it\u2019s his brother it was a-okay to let him live with us rent-free and not have to work.

A wedge between sisters caused by you can cause a wedge between you and your wife. \n\nFirst, let her leave, don't invite her back as long as she has a place to live. However, if she does have to return after her tantrum, I would set some SERIOUS boundaries with her first before things get started. For instance, she has to either order or cook dinner 1-2 times per week (if she can't, it should be her responsibility to clean the kitchen & do the dishes after y'all cook), has to clean all of her mess, etc. \n\nIf she sticks to the boundaries and takes care of her own shit, then it's fine. If not, she leaves.", "NTA. If your wife was gentle (you didn't provide much detail about the dinner conversation), then why would you be at fault? Your wife's sadness about her sister's reaction is, of course, completely understandable. But unless you bullied or somehow forced her to initiate that conversation, your wife would be unfairly painting you as the bad guy if she held you responsible for her sister's reaction. Your wife can't have it both ways. She can't agree that the conversation needed to happen and then blame you if her sister has gone NC.\n\nWhat I find very alarming is your MIL \"trying to fly in to try and sort things out\"! OK, now we're talking dicey situation! I firmly believe that in-laws need to stay out of these situations, but every family has their own ways. For myself, I would hope MIL's intent is to comfort SIL and, ideally, to arrange for an alternative living situation for her. Take care to \nhave your wife's back in case her mother says anything that is unfair or controlling of her.\n\nThe situation has the potential to become ugly. You can not control the behavior or those who want to insert themselves into this situation. Force yourselves to remain calm, fair, and united even if others become emotionally overwrought. The objective is for the sisters to come to an understanding and be able to repair their relationship. That would be tough to do in the midst of a family cluster fuck.\n\nEdited for grammar", "INFO\n\n\n>we would need sometime without her to try and reset and go from there, and if she would stay again setting better boundaries.\n\n>I have the sense her sister interpreted the conversation as we never want her around again\n\nHave you previously had any actual conversations (not just hints about her going out) with SIL about needing time without her, or is this the first time it's being brought up directly?", "I totally feel it. So, NTA\n\nMy criticism would be, though, that you waited too long and then got from 100 to 0 too harshly.

Your *wife* needs to explain that you two have a marriage, and that yes, she loves her sister or would not have let her move in initially, but that boundaries are needed between her as a single student and you as a couple, and sister didn't seem to recognize the need for separation of the two.", "NTA", "NTA - It sounds like you handled it very well . .. and so did your wife.

It sounds like MIL expects to fly in and set the *rules which will be obeyed*.  This whole thing is really none of MIL's business, but presumably she will try to be the final arbitrator in the situation.  \n\nI hope that MIL isn't planning to stay with OP and his wife while in their city - the better to boss them around.\n\n*(Wife).....did say she might feel upset with me if this permanently ruins the relationship she has with her sister*\n\nWhat a lot of nerve - this makes me huff with annoyance.  OP has already put up with a lot of BS from the sister.  **Wife needs to start wondering if her and her family's behavior has ruined her relationship with her DH**, the person she  swore to love and cherish.\n\nOP, it sounds like you have put up with more entitled behavior from your wife and inlaws than you realize.\n\nPerhaps a bit of therapy would help you learn how to stick up for yourself.\n\nNTA", "They went about it gently and voiced concerns.

You blindsided her, of course she\u2019s going to be hurt. Being introverted does not excuse a lack of proper communication between all parties involved. Take some time to reflect, look into better communication techniques, and I hope sincerely that your wife can at least repair the relationship with her sister.", "NTA and your wife has some fucking nerve!

When my sister was staying w us, I got tired of doing it all so I stopped & was waiting to see if she stepped up. She thought I was offended by her touching my stuff (I had made a comment abt similar situation w someone else & it bothered me) so she just assumed. Thinks got rocky/ugly. All could have been avoided had either of us spoke up.

How long do they expect you to allow your SIL to stay with you if she finds a job in your area?\n\nHaving another person in your home does impact how you live in that space. \n\nWith the sister not working and college us over she should be making dinner Monday through Friday. That is not an unreasonable request since you both work full time. At the end of the day,  having dinner ready would be appreciated. \n\nYou and your wife need to decide on boundaries. If you need alone time,  pick a time frame where the mall is open too. This way if SIL had no one to hang out with,  she can hang at the mall.  Its warm, there's food, she can sit and study or be on her phone.  \n\nThen call to clear up the misunderstanding and bring up what her plans are.

How far away do your SIL's parents live? It doesn't sound like she's going to be homeless but if she has to fly back there then it would be disruptive enough to upset her. If she just has to drive a couple hours to get to her parents' house, then to me it seems pretty reasonable that she doesn't stay with you continuously for months on end. You would hope she'd understand you'd feel a lack of privacy with her living with you over the course of months. I think a reasonable approach would be for her to come stay a couple weeks before her exam so she has quiet to really drill down into her studying, and go home in the in-between times. If nursing is a tough exam, she may have to take it a few times, right?\n\nIt probably would have been better for your wife to explain the situation to her sister in private. Then she could phrase things in a more familiar way. It probably didn't come out quite the same with you sitting right there, and her sister doesn't know you as well as she knows your wife. But what's done is done. \n\nI would think probably you could smooth things over by just saying, look it's not that we never want her here again, it's just not ideal for months at a time with no breaks for any of us. We're a young married couple working long hours, we need some limits and some space; if she comes for 2 weeks out of 4, and then home for the remaining 2 weeks at a time (or whatever schedule you and your wife like) then that will be ok for us.", "How did you get him out? How did you get your husband to understand?\n\nGlad your marriage survived.", "Adding on to this, change the locks or you might walk in some day and find that the sister has returned.", "Honestly, I didn\u2019t get those vibes. Nursing is an extremely stressful certification, and we didn\u2019t really get much of her side here, so she could be stressed and this could have just been the straw that broke the camels back for her.", "My mom just recently moved out. She was supposed to stay for 6m- 1 year. She was here for 4 years. By the end of it my husband and I were living in our bedroom and she had free run of the house, always asking us, \u201cwhere are you going, when are you going to come home, who are you going to see, etc \u201c and I\u2019m so glad my husband and I were on the same page the entirety of it.
