Let\u2019s call her Monica. Monica and I were considered equals by upper management and we worked closely for a couple years as partners on many projects.\n\nMonica and I had a falling out recently that ended up needing a mediation meeting with our boss.  The meeting had the opposite effect and instead of reaching a peaceful resolution it led to Monica yelling at me, disrespecting me, and belittling me all in front of our boss. Afterwards she was written up for how she spoke to me. \n\nAfter she disrespected me, I distanced myself from her. I stayed completely professional and friendly but I didn\u2019t go out of my way to speak with her at all. I wanted no association with her if I could help it. \n\nOur working relationship became nonexistent.

My coworkers noticed the tension between Monica and I, but made a point to stay out of it. Several of them told me they were on my side but no one wanted to get involved. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m planning my wedding and want to invite my other coworkers in the office. With all the mental anguish Monica has caused me (and continues to cause me) I want her to have zero part of my big day. \n\nI\u2019m concerned that it may make my other coworkers uncomfortable since she would be the only one not invited out of the group. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I invited everyone except her?", "created_utc": 1691018821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gnigi/wibta_if_i_didnt_invite_the_office_bully_to_my/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Inviting her is an HR nightmare waiting to happen. Honestly instead of asking here you ought to talk to an HR person to see if there could be any repercussions for you based on who you do and don't invite and why. If it were me I'd tell you it's fine as long as you and your coworkers don't talk about it at work or mention it in front of her, but that's just my opinion.", "I never thought I would read about somebody who wanted to invite everybody in an office department except one and vote NTA, but here we are. You had to have a mediation meeting and she was written up for how she spoke to you and she's still treating you badly, nobody reasonably could expect she would be invited to your wedding.

You're not obligated to invite anyone to your wedding, let alone someone who has treated you so shabbily.  \n\nI'm a little worried about you though.  This concern about your co-workers (who cares if they're made uncomfortable; you're made uncomfortable daily by Monica).  And the way you're being trampled on is concerning.  Is there no recourse at work?  Do you feel for some reason that you're not able to advocate for yourself?  It just sounds so toxic to stay there and not try to make the situation better.\n\nCongratulations on the wedding, though!", "Why WOULD you invite her, she sounds like a complete jerk who would sabotage your ceremony in some way.

The fact that your even considering it already makes you the bigger person.

If you don\u2019t want her at your wedding, don\u2019t invite her. Will it cause more drama in the office? Might. Might not. Why would she expect an invitation? Would she invite you? I\u2019m guessing NOPE on both questions. Keep your day happy. & Congratulations!", "NTA, your wedding so you have discretion to invite whoever you want. It certainly sounds like Monica would put a damper on the night \n\nThat being said you absolutely have to address her actions somehow. Whether that's with HR or directly with your boss or something else it sounds like she is very negatively impacting your position and it could have bad consequences. I would recommend somehow recording or documenting her actions so you have rock solid proof to show.", "NTA \n\nIf your coworkers aren\u2019t uncomfortable with her excluding you from emails and meetings, why would they be uncomfortable with you excluding her from YOUR wedding?\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding and you choose who you wish to share your special day with.", "If she hates you as evidenced by her treatment of you, why would she even want to go to your wedding, and why would you want to invite her.

If I were one of your coworkers, and you invited me and everyone else except Monica, I would not attend your wedding, because that would be you putting me in the middle of an already uncomfortable situation.  I might even be upset with you for making me choose a side publicly.  \n\nThe wedding aside, you should request a follow up mediation meeting to address her excluding you from meetings and emails, keeping you in the dark and blindsiding you, and lying to your bosses.  Back it all up with the documentation you've been keeping on the situation.  If you haven't been covering your own back at work, then perhaps you should start looking for another job.

If she *does* come to your wedding with a pissy attitude, then that makes her look all the more like TA, and of course if she becomes unhinged, you can have her escorted out.\n\nI think your safest bet to just invite her.  Not because she deserves it, just because it\u2019s a reflection of the type of person you are.  She\u2019s gonna make you feel weird that you did, but I think etiquette would say you should invite this person.\n\nYou could call this one into the [Were You Raised By Wolves](https://www.wereyouraisedbywolves.com) podcast and see what they say!\n\nEdit:  While you\u2019re likely going to be inundated with attention from all of your attendees and normal wedding things, you very likely will even forget she\u2019s even there, but you still shouldn\u2019t have to look at her face in the crowd if you don\u2019t want to see it. \n\nThis one\u2019s really hard!!!", "You have every right not to invite her but there will be consequences.
