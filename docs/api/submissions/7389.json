My dad had them with a high school girlfriend but was never in their lives (he'd sleep with her a few times and just never be involved with the girls). She was a train wreck and he made a promise to her parents that he would take them if she got so bad they were suffering for it. But he never planned to keep the promise and he never told anyone about them, never supported them or anything. So he married my mom and she had no idea. Then when she was pregnant with me the grandparents showed up and said the girls were not being taken care of and he needed to step up and be their dad. My mom was home on her own and was in so much shock. The girls were 6 and 8 at the time, and were 7 and 9 by the time I was born, I think. Dad got home after several hours and once he realized mom wasn't handling it like some saint he was trying to talk her into them raising them together. She didn't want to stay with a liar or raise someone else's kids so she left him and they divorced when I was 4 months old.\n\nDear old dad didn't want them either and would allow them to fixate on my mom. He tried to pawn them off on her many times. He'd ask in front of me for her to take them. He'd try to get her co-parenting the three of us instead of just me. Mom always kept firm and tried to keep that stuff away from me but dad never did. The girls spent years wanting mom to be their mom. They were in their teens and trying to use me to get mom to adopt them and stuff of that nature. It was sad. It was awkward as hell for me. The pressure was a lot. I hated dad and when I was 14 I stopped seeing him, and by extension the girls, who still lived with him. Then a couple of years ago they made contact with me and tried to have a relationship again. But they were still so fixated on mom and it made me uncomfortable so I always tried to avoid heavy topics with them.\n\nA couple of weeks ago while I was at mom's, they showed up and started yelling at mom and telling her that she was a piece of shit and she became their mom the moment she married dad and should have been there for them. They told her she owed them as much as she owed me and how could she not love them. I stepped in and told them they needed to leave and that mom was not their mom and they needed to accept that. It took some time but they left after I told them they needed to seek help to get over their fixation on mom and learn to accept that she's not their mom. I told them they need to stay away from mom, leave her alone, and work on themselves. They texted me after that I was an asshole just like her and they deserved so much better.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: To answer some of the questions that keep coming up. My mom did not live with them. She was gone once she found out about the lies and she was not part of their lives in any kind of parental or familial capacity, even at the start. She left dad and moved out. No trying to make it work. Their mom was not involved. She was not a good mother, she didn't want them either and the grandparents did not stay in their lives either.", "created_utc": 1673786446, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cix7j/aita_for_telling_my_half_sisters_they_need_to/", "score": 7726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I ask any of this is because I know they have been through so much and were never wanted, which is not something I can say, and maybe I lack too much compassion for them and it showed in this interaction we had. They might be grown now but they have never really known what it's like to be loved and it does show.

Your father is the AH though for what he did to those girls. They have a mom, and it\u2019s not yours.", "The only asshole here is your father who fucked those girls up so bad that two girls in their 20's are convinced that their dad's second wife should act and love them like a mother.\n\nI feel sorry for them tbh.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

She literally left your shitty father BECAUSE of the situation (I guess, a combo of his lying and her not wanting to raise someone else's children and not wanting to coparent with your shitty father).  \n\nSucks for those girls, and if they were still young teenagers, I might have a slightly different opinion.  But they're in their 20s now and if they don't have the emotional capacity to see that they're misplacing their anger and expectations on your mother instead of their own shitty parents, then they need therapy.

They need help that you cannot provide.", "NTA, someone needed to tell them. NAH besides your father. Obviously they were mentally harmed in this ugly upbringing and really need help.

Your dad is 100000% in all of this. \n\nBut in all seriousness, they are probably never going to leave you and your mom alone unless you get legal help to FORCE them to.

It\u2019s not necessarily the purest decision but it seems like it would be the most practical. And as much as they\u2019ve suffered, there is a point where you have to put yourself first.

Your mom had no idea what the real situation was when she entered it, and left when she saw what it truly was.

She was married to your dad for a short period of time and didnt even know about their exitence for most of that marriage. Let alone knew what she got into when she got married! How do these girls not understand the fact that your mom didnt chooose to marry a man with children? They were thrown on her out of the blue and she didnt want this and so she left! Good on your mom..\n\nYour half sisters need to stop wasting their time looking for a maternal figure, if their own mom isnt going to do it then thats the end of it.

The half siblings later were trying to manipulate OP's dad into grandparenting their children and that the dad \"owed\" them for not taking them in when the mom had passed away.\n\nYou are not the asshole and this idea that a half-siblings parents owe them anything is beyond baffling.  Yes there are a lot of parents who choose to raise kids that aren't theirs but it has to be the parents choice, not something forced on them.  The only people who owe you an upbringing are the ones who contributed to your DNA or CHOSE to adopt you.  Your sisters need a lot of therapy.

Kids what can I say. Instead of telling them the truth and stepping up, he tried to push them into your mother making them believe since they were married that's the mother not bio mother. That got stuck in your sisters' heads and they can't get rid of it. This is why they need help it understand that their anger is directed at the wrong person.

Their own parents were terrible, so they fantasised about your mum stepping in and showing them the love they deserved and weren't receiving from their own parents. Your father made it worse by convincing them that there was any possibility of your mum taking them. He fed their fantasy and set them up for disappointment.\n\nThe reason they reacted so explosively upon seeing your mum is because they view her not raising them as a form of rejection. When children are rejected by their primary caregivers, they become more sensitive to other perceived forms of rejection. Even though it was never your mum's responsibility or obligation to raise them, they still feel as though she rejected them by not doing so.\n\nBut, the girls are grown up now.

It is sad and unfortunate that your father is so lacking in morals and character, but that has nothing at all to do with you or your mother, who made it clear as soon as she learned about their existence, that she wanted nothing to do with being their step mother or raising them, and I assume that other than him being your father, also wanted as little as possible to do with your father, after the divorce, definitely, and maybe even before that. If they have been abandoned, lied to, mistreated, mislead, manipulated or managed in any way, it is by your father.

It is only out of some decency and courtesy that they have had any attention from you, as you don't have to continue speaking to them at all, after the way they have behaved toward your mother, who is really a stranger to them. Is it possible that their birth mother has some mental illness that prevents her from being a half way decent mother, or is she just a noncaring person, who just doesn't want to be a mother? I suspect they have a great deal of jealousy and envy when it comes to you and your mother, and they have somehow gotten it in their heads that she owes them something, but it is now beyond the point of reason, at their ages, to continue to try to push themselves onto you and your mother; they are attempting to insert themselves into your lives when they should have understood the reality quite a while ago. They are too old to be still bothering you and your mother; they need to accept the truth and go away; it may be time to include the law in your efforts. Maybe they will understand better if they realize that they are trespassing and legally harassing your mother, and continuing could result in legal problems.
