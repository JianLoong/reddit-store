The 26th of December it\u2019s a rough day for me it\u2019s the day my pawpaw passed back in 2018, so my emotions were already skyrocketed. So that night my childhood bestfriend had to work a late night shift 2am-6am and she was just getting off a 6pm-10pm. My house was  maybe 5 minutes from the job so I told her she could come over to get rest instead of driving 30 minutes back to her house. My mom and dad has let her stay over all the time do I thought no problem of it. Around 12am my dad is calling me cussing me out cause he see my friend on the sofa asleep and he was informed we were have guest and what not. Basically he says who are you to invite guest in my house without permission or authority like you own the place. Now rightfully I could say I do because I paid bills for the house before I moved but I didn\u2019t want he to get any more pissed then he already was. So i responded I have none. Then last thing he said to me was is all you see when you see me is the past, I said yes, and he said eff you I never want to see your mother effing face around me again get tf outta my house. So my mom is no where to be found she sat there and let him talk to me any kind of way and almost swung on me. I start packing my things I hug my sister and brother goodbye and I get ready to walk out the door. My mom appears and tells me I\u2019m not leaving and to go lay down we\u2019ll talking about it more in the morning. while both of my parents were gone I pack the rest of my stuff and call a friend, who came and got me thankfully. My mom has been calling me telling me to come back home and I\u2019m being immature about the situation, and I should\u2019ve went to my aunts for like a couple of days to cool off but I was being childish and moved out. I\u2019ve gone NC with my dad I blocked him the day I left and haven\u2019t talked to home since.

You don't have to, but if it helps you leave now, you can think of yourself as establishing a safe space for them to live also.", "If possible, I\u2019d encourage you to consider writing a safety plan for what to do if you find yourself heading for the bad place - things you can do that will help you change your mindset like listen to music or take a shower, someone you can call, etc. Thank you for hanging in there and pushing through.", "Then let her prove it by not budging. \"He goes or I wish you all the best.\"", "A safe space to live. If not that, save up a grand or two to help them secure an apartment. Help them find a roommate, help them find a job. \n\nWhen I was 18 having issues with my mom, my sister let me sleep on her apartment floor and got her best friend to give me a job at the retail store she managed. Kept me afloat until I moved into my college dorm full time.", "Yea I kinda have one it\u2019s just not written down if I even get that low again I would call my uncle because he was close too when he had his divorce", "It\u2019s not your job to keep the family together. It\u2019s theirs.", "NTA this is abuse. I should know. My mum was exactly like yours. An enabler who can't deal with the situation so makes out that you are the problem.\n\nStay safe. I think you did the right thing.", "NTA - sorry you are going through this.  I did  something similar at 17.  You are an adult and can do what you want.", "NTA", "Change your number so no one else can call you", "NTA. \n\nGood for you for getting away and staying away. \n\nYour parents are the adults and it is their job to provide for their children and \"keep the family together.\" Your father isn't interested in that, your mother is fine with your father acting this way, why should you put more effort in when this is the family THEY created?\n\nMaybe try and get in touch with your siblings and build that relationship, but you do not owe them going back.", "NTA  If your mother is that concerned for your siblings (and it sounds like she should be), she needs to kick out your dad and then invite you back in.  It's her job to keep the family together, not yours.", "NTA It's not your responsibility to keep the family together. Please don't go back. You deserve better than the nightmare that's going on in that house.", "It is not your job to hold the family together. It\u2019s your mother\u2019s job to protect all of you from your toxic and dangerous father, not to blame you for finally being able to protect yourself. I\u2019m glad you got out and got away. I hope at some point you can talk to a good therapist and try to unravel and repair the damage all of this has done to you. NTA.\nEdit: I just saw that someone suggested you call CPS because your sibs are at risk. Someone should have reported your father a long time ago, but it\u2019s not too late to do it now.", "Nta your a legal adult I would change numbers and move to another city.", "NTA. But, OP, call CPS. Tell them what has been happening in that household. Make sure your siblings are protected. If your dad is forced to leave because of his behavior, and he's not contributing to the bills, it won't impact your siblings' lives. Get him out!", "Yea I should\u2019ve moved out when he kicked me out the first time", "Thank you \ud83e\udd79", "I most definitely will", "Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Yep I\u2019m sorry you went through something like this as well I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemies", "Your crackpot scam links that you keep posting are going to get someone in trouble. Fortunately this op is smart and strong, but you're eventually going to pay this nonsense to someone impressionable and do real harm.\n\nAnd for what?", " I try to be but it\u2019s just not me", "I\u2019m trying my best with my brother but my sister wants nothing to do with me", "Yea but I know it could never happen but one could child could hope", "Yea when I\u2019m financially stable I\u2019ll invest in a good therapist", "I have moved to a different city but have yet to change my number just in case my brother might need me", "OP was probably the Designated Target. Now, it could be one of the siblings or it could be back on mom. 100% not excusing her, but we see this all the time.", "Your mother is an AH, a bad mother, and I'm so sorry she didn't fulfilled her parent role and pushed you her responsibilities.\nYour sperm donor is NOT your father from the moment he kicked you out.\nYou own them nothing, their children, their responsibility.\n\nNext time your mother send her coworker to guilt trip you just say \"they're not my children, you should tell -your mother name- to do her job as mother and parent her own children\".\nNTA", "I\u2019m so sorry.", "There are many of us who are proud of you. I am.", "Who cares what she says? Ignore it and go on with your life.", "Good for you! You get to choose how you are going to live your life. What\u2019s your major, if you don\u2019t mind my asking.", "Not only that, but it sounds like it\u2019s better for \u201cthe family\u201d NOT to be together. So keeping it up for appearances or whatever reason is actually bad for \u201cthe family\u201d. \n\nThe only person actually benefiting from the previous situation was the dad and sounds like he\u2019s draining and damaging everyone else.", "Enablers suck but saying they're worse than the abusers themselves is giving the abusers a free pass, IMO.  Makes it seem like the abuser has no control over their abuse and that it's the enabler who's responsible for the abuser's actions.", "Yea right now I realize my moms sister and brother raised me more than my parents did", "It\u2019s okay", "Meteorology", "Next time someone accuses you of that say \"why would they kick me out if I was keeping the family together?\"\n\nI'm willing to bet that your mother gave everybody a twisted version of events to make her and your Sperm Donor sound better. I'm sure if they found out that this was the case of a grown man getting aggressive and throwing his rent-paying daughter out, many would be more likely to at least leave you alone.\n\nNTA, sweetie. Hold firm on this and stay safe.", "Digital hug received and appreciated", "Abusers are entirely in control of their behavior, but people who create spaces for the abusers to get away with it instead of calling them on their shit and getting rid of them are worse in my eyes because they're also abusers; it's just a more insidious type of abuse. If my grandma had left her husband when she realized he was a horrible human instead of brainwashing us to think it's okay to be her stand-in punching bags, 3 generations wouldn't have been subjected to his abuse thinking that being hit, screamed at, manipulated, and stolen from was normal.", "No she doesnt  love him, she thinks she does because she doesnt know anything better.   Better the hell you know then the unknown heaven.   \n\n\nIt sad, but it isnt your problem.  Now go live your life to the fullest!!", "Thank you so much and yes she did give everybody a different story saying I ran away from home and my family", "Thank you and I am I\u2019m partying for Mardi Gras rn\ud83d\ude0a then back to the work and school grind"]}
