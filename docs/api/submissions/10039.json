My dad 49m and I has always had a rocky relationship he was a deadbeat that lived with us. He never took care of us and was always on drugs. As a child seeing your dad passed out on the floor is scary, but you get used to it as you grow up. The 26th of December it\u2019s a rough day for me it\u2019s the day my pawpaw passed back in 2018, so my emotions were already skyrocketed. So that night my childhood bestfriend had to work a late night shift 2am-6am and she was just getting off a 6pm-10pm. My house was  maybe 5 minutes from the job so I told her she could come over to get rest instead of driving 30 minutes back to her house. My mom and dad has let her stay over all the time do I thought no problem of it. Around 12am my dad is calling me cussing me out cause he see my friend on the sofa asleep and he was informed we were have guest and what not. Basically he says who are you to invite guest in my house without permission or authority like you own the place. Now rightfully I could say I do because I paid bills for the house before I moved but I didn\u2019t want he to get any more pissed then he already was. So i responded I have none. Then last thing he said to me was is all you see when you see me is the past, I said yes, and he said eff you I never want to see your mother effing face around me again get tf outta my house. So my mom is no where to be found she sat there and let him talk to me any kind of way and almost swung on me. I start packing my things I hug my sister and brother goodbye and I get ready to walk out the door. My mom appears and tells me I\u2019m not leaving and to go lay down we\u2019ll talking about it more in the morning. while both of my parents were gone I pack the rest of my stuff and call a friend, who came and got me thankfully. My mom has been calling me telling me to come back home and I\u2019m being immature about the situation, and I should\u2019ve went to my aunts for like a couple of days to cool off but I was being childish and moved out. I\u2019ve gone NC with my dad I blocked him the day I left and haven\u2019t talked to home since. My mom has gotten her work friends to call me and tell me I\u2019m also being selfish towards my siblings for leaving them alone when I was basically the only thing\u2019s keeping the family together.

As someone who grew up in an unstable environment, this one really struck home for me.  Call your siblings if you can. Tell them you love them.  Encourage them to look after themselves.

My mom tried some of the same guilt trip tactics that your mom is doing to you.  But the truth is he didn\u2019t leave me\u2026he left an untenable situation so he could take care of himself.  A couple years later when I left home myself, I understood that better.  I also understood that he had felt just as unqualified for the job as I had.  I just didn\u2019t notice that when I was relying on him.  It was unfair of my parents to put my brother (and then me) and the rest of our family that position.  \n\nHe took care of himself first, and in doing so he showed the rest of us how to do it\u2026And we did.
