Eh, if you've got a big secret you're trying to keep, it's generally not best to gather together everyone who knows the secret and everyone who doesn't and force them to mingle and eat food and possibly drink alcohol.

While there can be a strong connection (like/love at first sight),; for a majority of couples it takes time and multiple attempts/dates to find out if there is a connection at all. Obviously don't repeat dates with people that just activate red flag alerts, but with others as long as they meet your basic requirements give them a couple more dates in order to actually check compatibility and such.\n\n\nAlso space out dates as well. Give yourself time to think about the person you are attempting to date. Having dates lined up one after another stops your mind from digesting past dates. \n\n\nIt's your life and you can do what you want.
