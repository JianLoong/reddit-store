OP is still an asshole, however how do you\nKnow she lives where it\u2019s illegal?", "Copyright is the OPs.  The owner of a photo is the person who takes it, not the subject.", "International copyright and Berne Converntion are international. They apply in all countries. OP does not own the likeness to her niece despite being the one taking a picture. She has a right to private use. She does not have a right to make it public.\n\n Plus its in facebook's own terms of service.", "Candian privacy law is very explicit on the right to your own likeness. So is international privacy law, australian privacy law, GDPR, and american privacy law. And the ICCPR, which is international.\n\nInternational law makes it clear you own the IP to your own face.

This isn't a street photo.", "No, American leg doesn\u2019t apply here lol. \n\nAmericans are so weird.", "You do not own your own facial IP.

I work with GDPR regularly  \n\nNow, there is a grey area with famous people and an attempt to money from there likeness.\n\nPretty much everything you said is wrong.", "Not American, you're the weird one for not knowing that international legislation is a weird and wonderful beast. Both the legislation of the country of the user and the legislation of the country the company is registered under apply to a website.\n\nNone of which changes that IP and copyright law is international, so your whole chain or argument is invalid though.", "We have laws in Canada in reference to social media that\u2019s very different then the US", "> None of which changes that IP and copyright law is international\n\nWe aren't talking social media law. We're talking the big boy laws. Have a look at your own privacy act mate. And then the ICCPR.", "Do you not understand what the word **international** means??"]}
