The meta data with the sticker can be stripped out. Take a screenshot of the picture+sticker (which the computer in your phone will then consider 1 solid image) and post *that*. Then the sticker can't be stripped away (or at least, it's significantly harder to do so)", "Oh don't get me wrong, I agree the story probably takes place in the US. It's just good to mention that laws (and common expectations) can be very different in other countries.", "What is \u2018data is ramen\u2019 supposed to say?", "This specific leg doesn\u2019t effect internally lol. Moron."]}
