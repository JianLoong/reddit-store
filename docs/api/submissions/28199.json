Oh, hell no. Somebody -not you and the other three- needs to pay or it just shouldn\u2019t happen. \n\nNTA if you put your foot down. \n\nIs it too late to back out of the whole trip?

You don't know that person and only the one who wants that Sonntag person to come with you, will gain a bargain from it.\n\nIf they want to go they should such up the extra costs on their account or book a room to themselves.", "NTA. The room is booked and paid for. If they want to come, they book their own room. You don\u2019t add people to add cost, you add people to reduce it. If she isn\u2019t ok fully paying her own way to hang out with you when your plans are set, she doesn\u2019t come. Honestly it would probably be cheaper for the person who invited them to beg off than it would be for you to add this person. So I\u2019d talk to the other two and figure out if they are ok with the idea that just the three of you split this room and the other friend is free to split another one with her other friend if you want to offer any kind of compromise. But I\u2019d leave the bulk of any financial split on the shoulders of the friend who invited her.", " So that\u2019s about 70 euros each right?
