Like 70 euro each, which is not the worst amount but could get you a very nice night out and will eat at my savings for the trip. + it\u2019s also 70 euro for a friend of a friend, which made me even more hesitant to agree on the extra costs", "NTA. Tell the friend that changing a booking at the last minute, especially when adding a body to the room is going to blow the budgets of half of the friend group. Plus having 5 people in a group screws up the dynamics. From hotel rooms only having 2 beds, to not being able to eat at a 4-top tabletop. They should have checked the prices before inviting.

One of these friends made a unilateral decision to invite a 5th person, now rendering your original booking insufficient.

If they refuse, go with the original plan but only have 3 in your room, and the other 2 can find their own OR keep the original plan and the 5th wheel can book her own stay if she wants to join.  The last minute additional person should not dictate the execution of this plan.", "Oh, it will be tense so I understand your anxiety.  Just stick to doing your own thing and minimize the time you spend with her.  And try really hard not to get drawn into her drama.\n\nAnd by all means stick to your guns that you aren't paying anymore.  If they can't do the rebooking because money that's their problem.
