{"id": 10488, "submission_id": "117lzvs", "title": "AITA for calling out my sister for not making her wedding accessibility friendly for FAMILY", "selftext": "For context, I (34F) am a single mom to my daughter Mia (8F). Mia has been disabled since the day she was born and needs wheelchair assistance and constant care whenever she is awake. I absolutely love her to death and it\u2019s only been us during this entire journey, so I\u2019m definitely super protective of my little girl.\n\nI also have a sister Cassidy (28F) who just called me about the logistics/plan for her wedding in six months to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27M). She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.\n\nI truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister. You would think she would at least check in with me before she reserved the beach space because Mia obviously can\u2019t come. And now she\u2019s only telling me because it\u2019s set in stone and there\u2019s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It\u2019s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it\u2019s truly the worst feeling.\n\nCassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) \u2026 the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.\n\nWhen I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can\u2019t afford much. Like you\u2019re already paying for a whole wedding, but can\u2019t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn\u2019t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse. I\u2019m thinking about just telling her that we won\u2019t be attending her wedding and supporting a person who\u2019s inconsiderate to her own family.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676930649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117lzvs/aita_for_calling_out_my_sister_for_not_making_her/", "score": 7350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have offered you an option and you turned it down \n\nI have mobility issues. Before attending a wedding (or other events), I research the accessibility. I do not expect the host to make accommodations for me. That's my job. There was a family wedding I did not attend because the travel would be hard. Rather remote spot. The activities before the big day were hiking, horses, etc. I didn't go...and that was fine. I didn't make a fuss or make them feel bad. I sent a nice gift. Another wedding was in a downtown area because  guests could \"walk everywhere.\" Again, I didn't make a fuss. I took an Uber to some events and skipped others.  No fussing. I accept that as someone with mobility issues, I may need to miss some events. It is my job to figure it out. \n\nIt's $100 over the next 6 months.

It isn\u2019t like they are having a huge wedding. It\u2019s already a small affair.  You have six months to save $110, or reach out to other family/friends for help. It isn\u2019t unreasonable.", "NTA if you decided not to attend.

You sound like you think they should have run all the details by you first, you are not entitled to that.\n\nYou have 2 choices, save the money or don't go. Pick one and be done with it.", "YTA, as much as I hate to say it. The wedding is 6 months away. Can you start saving to rent a sand friendly wheelchair? My mother in law is wheel chair bound, so I know the difficulties that can come with accessibility, but no offense, this is her day. She did make sure there was a sand accessible wheelchair, so she was thinking logistically.", "YTA\n\nI understand that Mia is the center of your world, but she is not the center of this wedding.  The bride and groom have a location that is very significant to them.  They want to get married at that location.  That's far more important in the context of this wedding than whether the location is ideal for your daughter.  It's disappointing that the location they wanted was not more accessible, but it's very understandable why they want this location.\n\nThere is an accessibility option.  You can see if the bride/groom or your family would be willing to help with cost.  If not, 8 year olds don't generally enjoy weddings anyway, even if they love the bride and groom.  Adults often project that hurt onto kids, but kids view weddings differently (as a long, boring day).  My 6 year old niece reminds me regularly that while she loves me and is happy to be in my wedding, \"kids mostly hate weddings\", so there's definitely a cap on how excited she's going to get.  \n\nAnd if neither of those are good options, I am sure your sister would understand if you could not make it.  Caring for your special needs child is an excellent reason to be unable to make a wedding.  \n\nBut the bride and groom are not AH for wanting to hold their wedding at a location that is significant TO THEM and their relationship.  They are the center of this wedding, and their wishes take priority over just about everything else.", "YTA", "YTA. Bottom line is this wedding is about your sister and her fianc\u00e9. It doesn\u2019t sound like she purposely trying to exclude your daughter, she\u2019s just not making HER wedding about YOUR daughter and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unreasonable.", "YTA, just because your daughter has a disability doesn\u2019t mean everyone needs to accommodate you.

This is your sister's special occasion, and you're making it about you. You can't expect people to always prioritize you in every situation.

YOu do not need a motorized one.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t about you or your daughter. It\u2019s about your sister and HER wedding. Stop throwing a childish fit.

Did someone order an echo chamber.....of course they agreed but the simple fact is that you can still love someone and not be able to accommodate them. This is the beach where they met and is obviously hugely significant to them. I'm sure if your echo chamber friends could all stump up and help towards the $110 cost.", "[removed]", "YTA. She did make accommodation. She ensured a wheelchair would be available. You can surely save $110 in six months. It\u2019s less than $20/month. Additionally, Mia may have a lovely experience at the beach.

Continuing to devalue them will only alienate you and Mia further.\n\nYou should apologize to your sister, and start brainstorming how to save that $20/month or crowdfund the rental so Mia can experience the beach and be a part of this special event - as she is clearly wanted there.", "Yta. The wedding is about them, the beach is meaningful to them and instead of suppporting her you make it about you. If you cant go, decline. And they are not supposed to pay for the wheelchair, you are very egotistical and entitled. Just decline, stay home and be happy for her.\nNot everyone and everything revolves around you.", "YTA. How about instead of only talking to mothers with children who have disabilities, you talk to your friends or family and see what they think. Parents will always think their children should be the top priority, but someone shouldn't have to change their dream wedding to accommodate for someone else's kid.", "YTA. Your post reads like a whiny brat. You should stop talking to your echo chamber of disgruntled moms with the same chip on their shoulder. Your sister didn\u2019t plan her whole wedding around your child\u2019s disability to exclude her. Get a grip on reality.

Could this rental be in lieu of a wedding gift?\n\nThis reads like someone who has a victim mentality and only communicates with folks who will validate their feelings. Your friends are wrong. If your sister didn\u2019t want your daughter there, she wouldn\u2019t have done any research about the beach wheelchair. \n\nYou should always advocate for your daughter and it\u2019s awesome that she clearly has a mom who supports her.

Mia has been disabled since the day she was born and needs wheelchair assistance and constant care whenever she is awake. I absolutely love her to death and it\u2019s only been us during this entire journey, so I\u2019m definitely super protective of my little girl.\n\nI also have a sister Cassidy (28F) who just called me about the logistics/plan for her wedding in six months to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27M). She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.\n\nI truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister. You would think she would at least check in with me before she reserved the beach space because Mia obviously can\u2019t come. And now she\u2019s only telling me because it\u2019s set in stone and there\u2019s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It\u2019s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it\u2019s truly the worst feeling.\n\nCassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) \u2026 the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.\n\nWhen I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can\u2019t afford much. Like you\u2019re already paying for a whole wedding, but can\u2019t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn\u2019t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse. I\u2019m thinking about just telling her that we won\u2019t be attending her wedding and supporting a person who\u2019s inconsiderate to her own family.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not you or your daughter. Your sister and her husband. Who are living different lives to you. Sometimes your family will get to ask you to accommodate to their wishes, it's an unfair world but it doesn't make your sister unfair or cruel to you or your daughter. In this case, the issue is not how much she loves you to be willing to change for you, but **how much do you love her to be willing to adjust for her**.

Honestly it seems like you were looking for an excuse to be offended. The minute you hear the wedding is on a beach you assume Mia can\u2019t come, without even stopping to think about accessibility options?  This makes me sad for Mia, because it makes me think that your view of what she can do is so much more limited than it actually is. Just because she\u2019s disabled you assume she can\u2019t enjoy the beach?  Like no one with disabilities has ever been to a beach? I have a friend with ALS who has found all sorts of great ways (including sometimes some awesome wheelchair rentals) to get out in nature. I hope you can try to think that way for Mia.

They're not having an expensive and extravagant wedding, paying for multiple venues and fancy catering for expensive meals. It's a small wedding that clearly is on a budget as she said. They looked into the accommodations for you, but that doesn't mean they have to pay for that too when they're already paying for an entire wedding.\n\nYou are calling her all these unkind things but nothing you have said has actually been inconsiderate or cruel.

It gets used for every wheelchair user which ignores the experience of those of us who use a wheelchair part time in some way. For instance, I don't use a wheelchair in my house, because I'm never more than 2 metres away from a chair I can sit in or a handrail I can grab. I use a stairlift to get upstairs. But if someone assumes everyone who uses a wheelchair is \"bound\" to it, that contributes to the abuse we receive when, for instance, briefly standing up or walking to reach something, to transfer, or because it's not possible to use our wheelchair in that moment.\n\nI also don't agree with the idea that a wheelchair is something that I am \"bound\" to. Rather I feel it allows me the freedom to participate in society in a way that I wouldn't otherwise be able to.\n\n**I don't really have a problem with people using it to describe themselves.** But I think when it is applied to me, it's not only unhelpful but also fully inaccurate even symbolically.\n\nAlso, it might just be pattern recognition but the people who use the term are also the kind of people to be completely shocked when I stand up. Its use to describe me puts me on edge because I start to see their expectations of me, expectations that I know are inaccurate. As soon as I stand I'll know to expect some patronising bullshit like \"Oh my god it's a miracle\" or \"I knew you were faking\". Yup, standing up for 10 seconds is exactly the same as walking the half hour to the supermarket, spending 20 minutes on my feet while I'm here, and then walking the 30 minutes back with several shopping bags. You got me.\n\nEdit: Since this is being completely misread, I said *I don't have a problem with people using the term to describe themselves* (which I have now bolded because some people have clearly just skipped over it)*.* Nowhere was I saying people can't use the term for themselves. I just object to its usage to refer to me or to all wheelchair users, because it's inaccurate.

I don't dispute that my limited ability to walk is an immense privilege. But my condition does not only affect my ability to walk. I don't go into the specifics of my condition online, in part because I am uncomfortable with the way people hear about one way that it affects me (I literally said 1 sentence about my condition above and you felt the need to gauge my disability - not my ability to walk only, but my disability as a whole) and assume they know everything about how my condition affects me. Frankly, my inability to walk longer distances is one of the easiest things about my condition - I just use a wheelchair and for the most part, that solves that problem. Other factors of my condition affect me much more severely and impact my life far more. So I feel like you're the one speaking over me here. I am the expert in my own condition, not you.", "NTA.

I think etiquette is to give a gift of $100 value per person attention so I could see if you attend and do go the beach wheelchair route maybe scaling back the gift would be a reasonable compromise.

You mentioned that they've given a fair amount of notice, and others have suggested putting small amounts of funds aside or seeing if family would be willing to pitch in to help furnish the cost.\n3) They aren't asking their guests to pay to attend.
