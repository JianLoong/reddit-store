{"id": 10488, "submission_id": "117lzvs", "title": "AITA for calling out my sister for not making her wedding accessibility friendly for FAMILY", "selftext": "For context, I (34F) am a single mom to my daughter Mia (8F). Mia has been disabled since the day she was born and needs wheelchair assistance and constant care whenever she is awake. I absolutely love her to death and it\u2019s only been us during this entire journey, so I\u2019m definitely super protective of my little girl.\n\nI also have a sister Cassidy (28F) who just called me about the logistics/plan for her wedding in six months to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27M). She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.\n\nI truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister. You would think she would at least check in with me before she reserved the beach space because Mia obviously can\u2019t come. And now she\u2019s only telling me because it\u2019s set in stone and there\u2019s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It\u2019s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it\u2019s truly the worst feeling.\n\nCassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) \u2026 the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.\n\nWhen I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can\u2019t afford much. Like you\u2019re already paying for a whole wedding, but can\u2019t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn\u2019t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse. I\u2019m thinking about just telling her that we won\u2019t be attending her wedding and supporting a person who\u2019s inconsiderate to her own family.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676930649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117lzvs/aita_for_calling_out_my_sister_for_not_making_her/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have offered you an option and you turned it down \n\nI have mobility issues. Before attending a wedding (or other events), I research the accessibility. I do not expect the host to make accommodations for me. That's my job. There was a family wedding I did not attend because the travel would be hard. Rather remote spot. The activities before the big day were hiking, horses, etc. I didn't go...and that was fine. I didn't make a fuss or make them feel bad. I sent a nice gift. Another wedding was in a downtown area because  guests could \"walk everywhere.\" Again, I didn't make a fuss. I took an Uber to some events and skipped others.  No fussing. I accept that as someone with mobility issues, I may need to miss some events. It is my job to figure it out. \n\nIt's $100 over the next 6 months.

It isn\u2019t like they are having a huge wedding. It\u2019s already a small affair.  You have six months to save $110, or reach out to other family/friends for help. It isn\u2019t unreasonable.", "NTA if you decided not to attend.

Pick one and be done with it.", "YTA, as much as I hate to say it. The wedding is 6 months away. Can you start saving to rent a sand friendly wheelchair? My mother in law is wheel chair bound, so I know the difficulties that can come with accessibility, but no offense, this is her day. She did make sure there was a sand accessible wheelchair, so she was thinking logistically.", "YTA\n\nI understand that Mia is the center of your world, but she is not the center of this wedding.  The bride and groom have a location that is very significant to them.  They want to get married at that location.  That's far more important in the context of this wedding than whether the location is ideal for your daughter.  It's disappointing that the location they wanted was not more accessible, but it's very understandable why they want this location.\n\nThere is an accessibility option.  You can see if the bride/groom or your family would be willing to help with cost.  If not, 8 year olds don't generally enjoy weddings anyway, even if they love the bride and groom.  Adults often project that hurt onto kids, but kids view weddings differently (as a long, boring day).  My 6 year old niece reminds me regularly that while she loves me and is happy to be in my wedding, \"kids mostly hate weddings\", so there's definitely a cap on how excited she's going to get.  \n\nAnd if neither of those are good options, I am sure your sister would understand if you could not make it.  Caring for your special needs child is an excellent reason to be unable to make a wedding.  \n\nBut the bride and groom are not AH for wanting to hold their wedding at a location that is significant TO THEM and their relationship.  They are the center of this wedding, and their wishes take priority over just about everything else.", "YTA", "YTA. Bottom line is this wedding is about your sister and her fianc\u00e9.

This is your sister's special occasion, and you're making it about you. You can't expect people to always prioritize you in every situation.

YOu do not need a motorized one.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t about you or your daughter. It\u2019s about your sister and HER wedding. Stop throwing a childish fit.

Did someone order an echo chamber.....of course they agreed but the simple fact is that you can still love someone and not be able to accommodate them.

She did make accommodation. She ensured a wheelchair would be available. You can surely save $110 in six months. It\u2019s less than $30/month. Additionally, Mia may have a lovely experience at the beach.

Continuing to devalue them will only alienate you and Mia further.\n\nYou should apologize to your sister, and start brainstorming how to save that $20/month or crowdfund the rental so Mia can experience the beach and be a part of this special event - as she is clearly wanted there.", "Yta. The wedding is about them, the beach is meaningful to them and instead of suppporting her you make it about you. If you cant go, decline. And they are not supposed to pay for the wheelchair, you are very egotistical and entitled. Just decline, stay home and be happy for her.\nNot everyone and everything revolves around you.", "YTA. How about instead of only talking to mothers with children who have disabilities, you talk to your friends or family and see what they think. Parents will always think their children should be the top priority, but someone shouldn't have to change their dream wedding to accommodate for someone else's kid.", "YTA. Your post reads like a whiny brat. You should stop talking to your echo chamber of disgruntled moms with the same chip on their shoulder. Your sister didn\u2019t plan her whole wedding around your child\u2019s disability to exclude her. Get a grip on reality.

Mia has been disabled since the day she was born and needs wheelchair assistance and constant care whenever she is awake. I absolutely love her to death and it\u2019s only been us during this entire journey, so I\u2019m definitely super protective of my little girl.\n\nI also have a sister Cassidy (28F) who just called me about the logistics/plan for her wedding in six months to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27M). She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.\n\nI truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister. You would think she would at least check in with me before she reserved the beach space because Mia obviously can\u2019t come. And now she\u2019s only telling me because it\u2019s set in stone and there\u2019s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It\u2019s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it\u2019s truly the worst feeling.\n\nCassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) \u2026 the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.\n\nWhen I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can\u2019t afford much. Like you\u2019re already paying for a whole wedding, but can\u2019t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn\u2019t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse. I\u2019m thinking about just telling her that we won\u2019t be attending her wedding and supporting a person who\u2019s inconsiderate to her own family.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d be more sympathetic to your cause, but your sister is having, by pretty much all standards, a small wedding. If she was having a much larger wedding her budget concerns would be harder to understand. \n\nEdit: consider that some people have destination weddings that guests have to pay thousands of dollars to attend.

On top of that, this particular beach has special meaning, AND she took the time to investigate and even verify before booking accessibility options.

That's less than I would plan to spend on a wedding present for my sister. Did you even consider asking if she could overlook a cheaper present from you so you can budget for the chair?

She offered an accommodation, you declined. \n\nYou have a lot of dramatic words in your retelling of the event: How  ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING this will be for your daughter. How life is so hard for you and your sister is being CRUEL to you. I urge you to tone it down. At this point you're posturing and acting selfish. This party is a celebration of your sister. Not you or your daughter. Your sister and her husband. Who are living different lives to you. Sometimes your family will get to ask you to accommodate to their wishes, it's an unfair world but it doesn't make your sister unfair or cruel to you or your daughter. In this case, the issue is not how much she loves you to be willing to change for you, but **how much do you love her to be willing to adjust for her**. She invited you and offered a way your daughter can attend as well. Invitees get to accept or decline to attend a party, end of story.", "NTA- I have a physical disability that makes it hard to walk on the sand; I\u2019m not wheelchair dependent like OP\u2019s daughter is, but  OP\u2019s sister knows about the daughter\u2019s disability.", "NTA - she can have the wedding wherever she wants but she's made it clear the location is more important than having your daughter there. Tell her you can't attend since reasonable accommodations don't exist for your disabled child, and wish them the best.", "YTA your sister checked to make sure Mia could be specifically INcluded and with a 35 person wedding it does sound like they are on very tight budget themselves. Perhaps you could explain your financial situation to your sister and ask if instead of a present you can use that money towards the wheelchair rental. You have 6 months heads up to save for the rental IF you actually want to be there for your sister and include your daughter", "Gentle yta, it\u2019s her wedding and she\u2019s not entitled to rent the wheelchair. She provided a solution which I think is the bare minimum, but she is not entitled to rent it it out. If she had the means to do so, I would be questioning why she couldn\u2019t rent it for you. She gave you also a heads up so you could figure out a solution. But she\u2019s not entitled to accommodate your daughter, even though that would be very kind of her. But you are also not entitled to go to the wedding, if you feel that strongly about this, just don\u2019t go, have a fun day with your daughter since you both will be missing out.  I truly hope you will figure something out.", "NTA. good lord, these commenters have no idea what it\u2019s like to deal with ableism, micro aggressions, and inaccessibility every single day, nor the cost expenditure of being disabled in america. i\u2019m sorry that your sister clearly isn\u2019t interested in making accessibility a priority. this would absolutely affect my relationship with her. if it were me, i\u2019d probably not attend out of spite and take my kid out to an accessible adventure instead of dealing with a day of inaccessibility. if you decide you want to go and you need help with the wheelchair fee, shoot me a DM.", "YTA. You know, as the mother of a disabled child, that her needs can be costly, do you not? This is one of those costs. \n\nIt was very considerate of your sister to ensure that the beach had rentals you could take advantage of because she didn\u2019t have to do that.\n\nLet me phrase it in logic you may understand: \n\n\u201cIf not going to this wedding is the end of the world for you and your daughter, can you really not sacrifice $100 to attend a FAMILY wedding?\u201d", "This is one of the least thought provoking and intelligent comments I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of reading.\n\nYes she\u2019s the asshole but you\u2019re also a moron for why you think so", "Your neice sounds adorable!", "Good idea about checking around. I don't know how big Mia is but pushing a wheelchair through sand is flipping hard. I've done it for my mother and it's not fun. I have a disabled child too from birth. He learned how to walk at almost 3 but he still has major issues and has to use a wheel chair sometimes and it's extremely hard to push him. I couldn't imagine doing it through sand.", "You could\u2019ve said YTA without being an asshole yourself.", "Yikes!", "I don\u2019t know what your problem is, but stop taking it out on op", "She probably did consider that people wouldn't be able to attend. By your logic, probably EVERYONE who has a beach wedding is an AH.", "So by your logic my wife and I are a-holes because we had our wedding in May in Texas when it was hot af. I guess no summer weddings or weddings in hot parts of the world?", "I was really taken by surprise that this is not the dominant take. Everyone going on about it's their day and all.. Yes it's their day and if sister would have cared enough that her niece attends she shouldn't make her mom pay for it. It's quite audacious to have a rental prerequisite for guests, unless you don't give a shit if they show up or not.", "I totally agree. The bride knows her sister is a single mom if the bride really wanted her niece to attend the bride would find the solution.", "Agreed.", "Also seems like the aunt did think about the daughter here. She already knew the cost of renting a beach access wheelchair. Why would she know that if she hadnt planned ahead of time. OP YTA, not your sister.", "Knowing why the bride chose the venue - it\u2019s 100% more important than having a child at the wedding. If she can\u2019t save $115 she has a lot more problems to worry about.", "Yeah I said esh bc really no one in the family could help come up with the money if she can\u2019t save it up?", "The sister probably feels that having OP there is not as important as having her dream wedding at her dream location. Can\u2019t say I blame her. \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t OP ask for help paying for the beach chair from other family members BEFORE she jumps to claiming that she\u2019s being irreparably excluded. There\u2019s quite literally an accessibility aid ON SITE that these peoples parents could pay for instead of having one sister drop 110$ for the other.", "Everyone has a bias. People who don't need wheelchairs or other mobility aids are very often biased against people who need accommodations for disabilities.", "Does being in a wheelchair mean you can never go to the beach? I know that it would be harder, but surely not that unheard of?", "Exactly. Hold your head up high, OP. Wish your sister a lovely event and plan a fun evening for you and your daughter at home. \n\nDon\u2019t you dare let anyone guilt you into shelling out an extra $110 to attend. You are not required to pay a disability tax if you don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t afford it.", "smart move.\n\nNTA, she sort of uninvited the kid by creating a financial burden for the mother", "I think You will be shock how nowadays some (a lot) people can't save $5 dollars a week", "So chalk it up to a mistake on her part rather than deliberate cruelty.", "I agree. And if OP wants to be petty, rent the chair instead of giving a wedding gift.", "Seriously, it's like $20 a month.", "How is it not accessible though? Why is it up to sis to front the cost, especially if they aren't close?", "Nope. It\u2019s not the sister\u2019s responsibility to pay for OP\u2019s child to be able to go.", "Not everyone who is in a wheelchair can use those sand ones. My son is unable to keep himself upright so his wheelchair has side supports to keep him from falling over. These sand wheelchairs are generally used by people who simply have mobility problems that make it difficult to walk on an unstable surface. I\u2019d never be able to use one of these for my son and it\u2019s possible OP is in the same position. \n\nIf this were a friends wedding or that of a slightly distanced family member, I\u2019d say OP is the ah. Given that this wedding is her SISTER\u2019S wedding, I\u2019m fully in the NTA camp. I believe OP\u2019s friends are correct when they say the accessibility is being used to keep Mia away. Dollars to doughnuts this is a mY dAy type bride who doesn\u2019t want the \u201cgirl in the wheelchair\u201d to take away from her vIsIoN. With only 35 people invited, she\u2019d be hard to miss.", "This is the perfect comment.", "this comment is everything. YTA", "But if OP really wanted to go she could do the same, so it is not fair to say that if the sister wants her there then she will pay for it. She has 6 months to come up with the money so that she can accommodate her own daughter and still go and support her sister.", "We don\u2019t know the disability but coming from someone who works in healthcare, for many, \u201ctrunk support\u201d from pillows is not enough. Many need specially outfitted wheelchairs, regular chairs, car seats, etc, for them to be able\nto have enough support to be able to keep their airway open.", "What exactly obligates the bride to pay for this?", "Why? That\u2019s a decent sized expense for one guest who\u2019s 8 years old. Sister made sure the wedding was accessible for niece, OP should be responsible for her daughters expenses.", "It\u2019s not up to the couple getting married to pay for everyone else\u2019s stuff.", "But would you expect your aunt to plan her wedding around you?", "This!\n\nOP needs to understand that life is not about her 100% of the time", "My friends used a sand wagon for years before they got a chair, it was wayyyy easier.", "Yep that was harsh damn x)", "Found OP's second account", "kinda, it really sucks to be dressed up on the beach. The reception would be very uncomfortable if you have sand all in your party clothes", "I literally teach kids with severe disabilities, some in wheelchairs, and I think OP is the AH. It's not that hard to transport a kid across the sand in a wagon built for that or in the wheelchair her sister mentioned. Maybe she can ask other family to help with the cost.", "I think it depends a lot on the wheelchair and on the beach. Some people have additional needs and have chairs with complicated electronics. I was a lifeguard at a beach that had a wheelchair ramp down to the water and a free loaner wheelchair for sand. It was hardly ever used.", "I don\u2019t think the average wheelchair is good for traveling on sand.", "Have you tried pushing/pulling a wagon through the sand? Do you think it would be comfortable or easy for someone in a wheelchair to push themselves or be pulled/pushed in one with all the jostling and such?   \n\n\nThis is why OP is upset - able-bodied people say stuff like this and y'all really don't spend any time really thinking about logistics for folks with disabilities and how many accommodations DO NOT exist for us. Then we're either told we're being extra for wanting to be considered, or that it MUST be possible we're just not trying hard enough or thinking about solutions - as though our whole existence isn't problem-solving around a world that would rather we didn't exist and treats us as such.", "Sometimes people just don't think about these things. It might not occur to her that she can't afford to rent it.", "Because a host should make their guests comfortable, and you take people as they are. If the sister wants Mia there then yes she should offer to pay.", "they are probably not thinking about the girl at all, they are just thinking about their own wedding and where they would like it to be. This is some serious main character complex you're projecting here", "Hope this becomes the top comment. OP, YTA", "Nothing, but it would be the kind and sisterly thing to do, and completely solve the problem.", "Nothing, except common decency", "In effect, this means that OP should have to pay a disability tax to attend the wedding. \n\nPersonally, I would just rsvp no and wish them a lovely evening.", "I disagree that sister made sure the wedding is accessible. I assume (possibly incorrectly) that her sister knows that OP can not afford the rental.  Just having a chair available for rent is not \"making it accessible\"", "OMG totally is", "I love beach weddings! Kick off your shoes and enjoy the sand between your toes.", "You know wedding invitations are voluntary and not court mandated, right? If you don't want to go, then you don't go. Some people have destination weddings. They certainly don't expect all their friends and family to try to attend.", "What's your point? What you've said here in no way contradicts what I said: everyone has biases. No one is completely objective because our opinions are based on our own experiences. The comment I was responding to is suggesting that people with disabilities and their allies are somehow more biased than able bodied people, and that's just incorrect. Of course OP could rent a chair or ask for family help to do so, but by that same token, if the sister wanted her sibling and niece to attend her wedding she would have made some effort to choose a truly accessible venue. She prioritized the venue over her family.", "She already made sure it was accessible for her daughter. OP is being entitled demanding to be financially accommodated on her SISTER\u2019s WEDDING day. If she can\u2019t afford it then she shouldn\u2019t be mad at anybody else for not being able to either.", "This, lots of people have destination or child free weddings and it's ok, that day it's about the couple", "That\u2019s the same reasoning everyone saying she\u2019s wrong is using, and I don\u2019t agree with it for the reasons I said above"]}
