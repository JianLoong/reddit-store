Her job there was a constant through out her life and she loved working it. There is no shame at all in helping people grieve for their loved ones as a job.

Because there aren't huge numbers of your profession. A lot of us know odd things about various people's jobs but probably very little about the nuts & bolts of an important job like yours. If you're the curious sort there is bound to be dozens of questions that might cross your mind when you hear about such a job. \n\nBut some people have real difficulties with the entire concept of dead bodies (which is really odd when you consider that is the **one** guaranteed end result of every single human on the planet). So what's nasty or inappropriate about that? It hurts a *lot* when you see the dead husk if you loved the person that it used to be, (to me - what makes a person \"them\" somehow isn't there any more when they die so a dead body is simply a decaying, uninhabited shell) but the remaining body itself isn't nasty or inappropriate. When my father died at home, he was taken out of the house to the funeral directors and I couldn't bear to watch that. That body had been him, up to a few hours beforehand, and suddenly it wasn't and I felt just freaked out by that in the aftermath. I went to view his prepared body in the chapel at the funeral directors. It was sad but a helpful part of trying to process that he's really gone. Your head intellectually knows that person is dead and gone but part of you internally is madly denying the fact for one hell of a period.", "It\u2019s super interesting. There was even a video game recently called The Morticians Assistant that was super popular with YouTubers. Great, well-timed jump scares combined with the grim fascination about what happens to us after death. \n\nBeing a mortician is a noble profession that helps to ensure the dignity of the deceased and gives comfort to their loved ones.

She also did the narration for the audiobook, which was awesome. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom Here to Eternity is more of an observation of various death cultures around the world, which introduced me to the sky funeral customs.

They're (hopefully) going to be connected to you through your sister for life.  It's not like either you or they are going anywhere soon.  \n\nI will also say - what you do is very important.

In fact my first job at 16 was working at my uncle's funeral home (mowing, vaccuming, setting up the chapel, cleaning the vans, etc).   You say that your family is disappointed that you didn't become a doctor, I find that a bit funny because of my mother's four siblings one of them works at the Mayo clinic, one is a partner in a successful law firm, the third was a C-level executive but my uncle who instead joined a family owned funeral home, worked out 10-15 years there and bought out his employers two funeral homes when they retired is by far the most successful of the bunch.", "It's interesting because it's not everyday you meet someone who works as a mortician.

I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nAlso maybe I\u2019m weird but I\u2019ve always been interested in working in funeral administration, I like the idea of helping people though an inevitable but difficult time in their lives and trying to make it as easy on them as possible.
