The complaint was that Jane was asking customers for money outside ours doors with a puppy. Nothing unusual it occasionally happens and my company has a no loitering or panhanlding policy like most. Then I received a call from our local PD that someone called in a complaint of Jane panhandling and that she was her with two other guys in a truck asking for money. I didn\u2019t know anything about two guys and assumed the caller was wrong, I told the police not to bother as I was getting ready to talk to Jane.\n\nI go outside to ask Jane what\u2019s up and Jane informs me she\u2019s waiting for her mom and has been waiting over 2hrs. Jane for reference has a puppy in a blanket. I told Jane technically there is a no loitering policy but I\u2019ll let her wait for her mom as long as she doesn\u2019t ask people for money.\n\nFast forward I keep an eye and watch as people give Jane food, gloves, a blanket, dog treats, and other items. I had an employee take off their uniform and listen to what Jane was saying.\n\nJane was greeting customers and then followed it up with a compliment as they walked by. If a customer engaged her Jane would ask if they\u2019d like to pet her puppy. If they did then Jane would tell the customers how she\u2019s been stranded her for two hours, she\u2019s cold and hungry, has no money and doesn\u2019t know when her ride will be here. \n\nI ultimately received another complaint and informed Jane she would have to leave the property. I watch her on camera walk to the back of the parking lot to a truck where a man is sitting in the drivers seat, she drops her puppy off and then begins walking back towards the store. I review video and see the truck has been sitting back there for over an hour. \n\nCue to Jane walks back in and I meet her at the doors. Jane asks if she can use the restroom and I respond yes but she must leave immediately afterward. I then told Jane that\u2019s a nice truck for someone waiting for their mom to pick them up. Jane says that is her mom and she just got her. I respond saying the trucks been here over an hour and Jane walks to the bathroom.\n\nAs soon as she comes back to the doors I tell Jane she is never welcome here again and if I see her I\u2019m calling the cops. I tell her she is a disgusting, terrible person with no respect and is part of the problem. Jane hung her head low and said nothing as I berated her and left. Jane then gets in the pickup truck and leaves.\n\nA customer stops me and tells me my behavior was wrong and that I don\u2019t know her situation. I agreed with the customer saying I don\u2019t know her situation but what I do know is she was just lying about so people would give her money.\n\nTLDR: Lady was claiming to be stranded, cold and hungry, I found out she was lying and verbally berated her, others thought I was too harsh and shouldn\u2019t judge her.", "created_utc": 1696800770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173albk/aita_called_a_women_begging_disgusting_and_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you should have let the police handle it. They have more resources could have looked into whether the man in the truck was forcing her to do what she was doing.  When she came back in to use the restroom and was out of his sight, you may have missed an opportunity to make sure she is not in that kind of situation. \n\nSo someone here is an A-H.

Just because she isn\u2019t being pimped for sex doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t being used. That might not be her situation but if it is calling her names on top of her already being a victim is pretty gross. Next time tell the woman she isn\u2019t welcome back unless it\u2019s to call a DV shelter (don\u2019t give her the number in writing unless she asks for it, it can be dangerous for her to have it on her if it\u2019s discovered).", "Telling her she\u2019s disgusting was going to far but NTA.

She was harassing people and driving business away. You should have had the police remove her though.

For all you know the man is making her do it.", "NTA\n\nAs a professional in your workplace, I don't think you should have said that because you are at work \n\nAs a someone who is not at the work, I would have said the same thing.

Yeah, you don\u2019t know the situation, but at the end of the day you have to ensure your employees and customers are safe and berating someone who is doing something shady in/near your store/on the premises is TERRIBLE behavior for a manager.", "Ofc YTA.", "If you think \u201cJane\u201d saw a cent of that money I\u2019ve got a bridge to sell you.
