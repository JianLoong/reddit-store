Then I received a call from our local PD that someone called in a complaint of Jane panhandling and that she was her with two other guys in a truck asking for money. I didn\u2019t know anything about two guys and assumed the caller was wrong, I told the police not to bother as I was getting ready to talk to Jane.\n\nI go outside to ask Jane what\u2019s up and Jane informs me she\u2019s waiting for her mom and has been waiting over 2hrs. Jane for reference has a puppy in a blanket. I told Jane technically there is a no loitering policy but I\u2019ll let her wait for her mom as long as she doesn\u2019t ask people for money.\n\nFast forward I keep an eye and watch as people give Jane food, gloves, a blanket, dog treats, and other items.

I review video and see the truck has been sitting back there for over an hour. \n\nCue to Jane walks back in and I meet her at the doors.

You steadily collected information on her for what reason? The satisfaction of being able to tell her off? Your company has a no panhandling policy yet you instituted your own system. How would you explain to your supervisors why you did all this, looping in another worker on company time, when you have a no panhandling policy AND police offering to handle it? \n\nIdk dude this bad from both the human and soulless corporation sides, I have no idea how you\u2019d think this is the best way to go.", "NTA but what you did was wrong.

And was going on disney vacations with his family. But he'd be out everyday begging for money. He would tell people no to jobs because he made more begging.

I get that people can enter poverty long after acquiring a nice vehicle, but you've pointed out other lies. She is working the crowd trying to get money from people who want to sincerely help. \n\nWe don't know what Jane and her partner spend the money on, whether the puppy is properly cared for, etc. And what happens when the puppy gets bigger? Does she get another puppy? \n\nWhen I go to a store, I don't want to be guilt-tripped like this. I've been through hard times, and there are tons of resources out there for people in need that I believe should be utilized by those who need them. I pay my taxes, which help fund these programs. I donate when I can. But I have a family, and I can't be nickel-and-dimed by people who haven't gone through the process of applying for help like I did so long ago. \n\nThere are tons of situations out there, and tones of solutions beside panhandling on street corners and outside stores. If we're going to a store, we can't claim we don't have money, and I've had some people ask me to get cash out with my debit card after I say I have no cash (like when I'm on my way in, and they expect me to come out with cash). I don't need the pressure, the pushy 'sales' techniques, having to discern who's sincere, etc. \n\nSincere or lot, store management always has the right to send trespassers away. The store is for shopping, not panhandling. The manager had every right to tell Jane to leave (I would have told her to wait for her mom elsewhere, like a bus stop), but calling her disgusting and terrible is a little too far.

Your mom can pick you up at the police station, and the police can direct you to appropriate resources for help.\" \n\nIf she's lying about being needy, this will get rid of her and she'll find somewhere else to panhandle, and hopefully get removed from there, etc. If she keeps getting trespassed, it will result in jail and/or court time, and hopefully she'll cut this shit out. \n\nIf she's not lying, removing her will take the pressure off your other customers, and get Jane the right kind of help-- not just welfare, but also something leading to employment.", "Nta in my city,  there are coordinated gangs of beggars all for drug money.

The guy was actually an ex-con who was still conning.  Lost him arm due to a previous crime gone bad and his \"babies\" were in their 20s.  He would claim to be Army, Marines... whatever worked that day.\n\nAn old couple with their car hood up.  They would try to start it (which it wouldn't) when people would walk by and say they ran out of gas and needed a gas can and a ride to the gas station.  Of course, people would just give them money.  When finally asked to leave, they would fiddle under the hood for a minute, jump in, start it up and leave.  \n\nA guy with a cardboard sign (Military Vet Need Bus Ticket To Michigan) standing near the Interstate.  Same guy has been spotted in this extremely busy area for about 7 years now.  Chances are he's collected enough for several buses of his own by now.\n\nA woman with three small kids outside a grocery store.  She would politely ask for money for  groceries and, if the person said no, the kids would - on cue - start crying.  When asked to leave and started a fuss, it was discovered that her kids weren't even her kids.  She would borrow them each day \"babysitting\" for a neighbor and bribed the kids with candy bars.\n\nThe majority of these people you see begging are lying and misrepresenting.  As much as we want to believe they are the people who really need help, they are not.  Please donate to local shelters, food banks and crisis centers.  People who really need help are directed to these types of resources.  Those who really need help are out looking for jobs or assistance.... not hanging out in front of stores or jumping into traffic for money.  I carry resource cards with me to hand to those who might really need help.\n\nOP is NTA.  You may have sounded heavy handed to the complaining customer, but you did the right thing.

At worst, she could very well be a victim of trafficking and is going along because she is in fear of her life. \n\nThe right thing to do would be to say I know there are two guys in a truck involved in this operation and ask her if she needed help.", "I came here to say this.  She could be a victim of trafficking and if I had seen the video,  my first question would be if Jane is okay and then if she is in danger or requires assistance.", "This is such a wild, out of nowhere response. You have literally zero evidence to support this whatsoever. You have no idea if she's a victim or not. The only thing you know for a fact that she's doing is lying to guilt strangers into giving her money, which IS part of the problem.\n\nShe could have asked for help if she wanted it. Coming from someone who has seen a whole host of issues just like this, if they don't want the help, then nothing you can do or say is going to make them want it. Calling OP gross and saying he's the AH just because he reacted how he should is ridiculous.", "Also why go so far as to direct an employee to remove their uniform to spy on what this person was doing/saying. Just tell them to leave or lets the cops handle it. Why the crusade?", "THATS WHAT I SAID!!! Escalated it and got really lucky Jane didn\u2019t hulk out or send in the guys from outside.", "I mean Janes liar and harassing people on company property.  I do think it\u2019s disgusting to lie about circumstances for money. Using a dog/ baby / fake trauma etc for sympathy is disgusting.  OP dealt with the consequences while making minimal money/ or minimum wage.", "Im sorry that happened to you!", "One guy tricked my son when he was in high school. He wasn't homeless but still got a meal and a few bucks from a kid who made minimum wage.", "This woman was likely a victim herself, being forced to beg by whoever was in the truck.", "Good point and a distinct possibility.", "My friend, I have been down voted bc I have disagreed with the OP, and mentioned developmental milestones. Reddit is a cruel mistress.....", "Check out u/Much-Pumpkin-3706's reply, they probably have it right. The lady could be a victim of trafficking, being forced to panhandle and then give up a portion of her collection.", "I just want to point out that poverty isn't solely a starting point. You can become poor at any point in life.  It's not unusual for someone desperate to have been formerly well off, and it would be wise not to sell a nice car because the amount of $ will not elevate your situation if you now lack reliable transportation. I am not arguing that 'spangers are all honest, and I genuinely can't stand when people try to manipulate me for $ whether by intimidation or sob story. (If I have it to spare I'll give it, if I don't I won't. Your story doesn't change that. I don't care what the money is for in the first place) I just recently lost everything and now all the people I'm working with to get back on my feet speak to me like I'm ignorant of how to be a responsible adult (until I tell them I'm new)  because people view poverty as something you work out of, not fall into", "My friend's dad used to do it. He owned a company and basically made all his money from that. He would put on ragged old clothes then go panhandle on a busy main road during morning rush hour then go do work for his company then he would head out again when it was the evening rush hour. We could never figure out why he did it since he made good money from his company. He was a cheap bastard and treated my friend horribly. I think he just liked feeling like he got one over on people and feeling superior to others since he could scam them.", "It probably helps that it's not taxed (because the government doesn't know about it). Tax-free income is a huge deal\n\nSo, in a decently populated area, if one out of every ten cars gave $1, and there are 20 donations per hour, that's $20 an hour. $20 times 40 hours is $800 a week, or $3200 per month. Say $35k per year, and that's not taxed. AND this assumes they only get $1 per donation, and not bigger amounts. Bigger donations (a.k.a. more than $1) happen a lot. And I'm guessing it's also more than 20 donations per hour. So from there it just balloons. \n\nSay they get $20 (\u00d71), $10 (x1), $5 (\u00d73), and $1 (\u00d75) each hour. That's $50 per hour!! That's a big deal... that's $2k per week, $8k per month, and at least $80k per year if they only work 10 months. And it's not taxed! \n\nStill seems unfathomable to me, but apparently pan handling can make decent money.", "So you heard that, believed it, and repeated it? Crazy", "So she was watched by two dudes in a truck and kept coming back despite it not being profitable anymore and you think she did this willingly?", "Do you realize that YOU possibly overlooked someone in need of help? Ffs she was being watched by a man in a truck the entire time. Ever hear of trafficking??", "Do you realize that there is a non-zero chance that you told a victim of human trafficking that they were disgusting and to never come back? If there was even a small chance that this person was not a liar, I don\u2019t know why you had to take things so far and to call her names and insult her. I think you might need to consider that YOU are actually the reason people, including myself, are so cynical about the state of our society.", "You\u2019re blaming one person for the systemic problem. Good job.", "Don't you have your own business to run? Like your job? Sending undercover employees out there seems outside your job description.", "And other people overlook the fact that a woman is very likely being forced into doing something, and likely not keeping a red cent of whatever she collected because it all goes to the men in the truck who are almost certainly using/abusing her.", "Asshole", ">People who really need help get overlooked because a certain percentage of the population are skeptical that they genuinely need it.\n\nI mean...sometimes? But it's a bit naive to think that's the only reason people don't help more. Some people just don't want to help, some can't afford it, no one can give to every beggar they see, etc.", "These are well known and well documented scams worldwide. It\u2019s not a \u201cwild, out of nowhere response\u201d. It\u2019s literally what was happening.", "I guess it depends on what the cops are like in that area. If OP really doesn\u2019t want to sic the cops on her, wants to give her the benefit of the doubt, but still needs to make sure she isn\u2019t panhandling, then it\u2019s not totally unreasonable to send a plainclothes employee to confirm she\u2019s behaving.", "There\u2019s a nonzero chance she\u2019s being forced to do this by whoever watch waiting/watching in the truck, and that she\u2019s in a very unsafe situation. Instead of berating her, OP could have asked if she was OK and offered to help her get help if she needed it. Helping someone out of that kind of situation isn\u2019t easy by any means but it certainly doesn\u2019t start with calling the victim disgusting.", "So what? Doesn\u2019t mean he has to degrade her", "Redditors: \"do this and this to be a good person.\" \n\nRedditors after reading a person do this and this to be a good person: \"no not like that.\"\n\nReddit can definitely be the wild west.", "It\u2019s crazy! I don\u2019t even care about being downvoted but \u201cdon\u2019t drug your kids\u201d was a weird controversial opinion to me", "Who can actually stand to sit in one place day in day out for that many hours out in the elements?  I see people badly burned or close to heat stroke in the summer and terribly underdressed and sitting in the freezing cold for hours in the winter.  It's brutal.  No one could stand that for 40 hours a week.", "This is just something people talk about to feel better about not caring about/giving money to homeless people. No they aren't secretly rich from begging.\n\nThe more likely scenario than 'fraud' is that whoever this man is takes a cut of the money Jane makes and that they're in a relationship that is predatory to her (this is what most of the 'human trafficking' in the US looks like btw, not like the movie 'Taken'). The man has a nice car because there are multiple women he 'manages' who panhandle and do sex work and give him a cut.", "Spidey did more than just believe and repeat it. Spidey embellished it.", "ABC news repeated it too.", "Ever had someone lie to your face and give you a sob story only to realize they were a liar? Why are you condoning this behavior?   Cops don\u2019t care enough to come but OPs bosses care enough to blame him.     He probably was an ah,  but she probably doesn\u2019t come back.", "Here us my upvote for telling the truth", "\u201cHe probably was an ah\u201d yeah he was that\u2019s why I voted YTA you just proved my point", "Yeah I live by a corner people beg on every day I don\u2019t call them names or degrade them. I\u2019m not condoning her behavior I\u2019m pointing out his own bad behavior which makes him the asshole.", "Lol yea I said that, I changed my opinion.  I know\nIt weird on Reddit.", "I can respect that.    I suppose per post rules I\u2019d agree he was an AH.   Probably let some past customer service experience come across in my petty thought process.", "I commented 2x before you replied. Welcome to the winning team \ud83d\ude08", "Lol how dare you make me think of being a good person.   Take our* W. \n\nEdit: our W over your W."]}
