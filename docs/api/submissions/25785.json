Yeah, that\u2019s pretty shitty.", "QUESTION - How long has your husband been financially controlling you?\n\nNTA - It's your own money, spent on your own things.\n\nYou would only be the asshole if you've spent joint money or savings. If you've just spent some of your own spare income, he can take a hike.", "NTA - it's your money you can choose what to do with it. You're allowed to treat yourself especially when you can afford to. You didn't use your shared account you used your private account so you're not an asshole even slightly. \n\nINFO? is this frugality a shared choice or did your husband decide that?", "I don't get it.\n\nYou DID tell him that you bought the earrings. Was he upset that you told him AFTER you made the purchase, and not before?\n\nYou did inform him.  Maybe wording is off here. \n\nI think he is upset because you did not get his permission and approval. If this is the case, NTA.\nThese are no longer Victorian times, and women actually have rights to her own money, and can hold property in her name. \n\nI'm wondering, does he ask for your approval for all purchases? Buying a beer? If brake pads need to be replaced on the car? Filling up with gas? Buying a Coca Cola? \n\nMost couple do have a limit and if a purchase is over that, it should be discussed. \n\nMy husband broke the rule.  Knew I would get upset and purchased a ridiculously huge canvas tent for camping \ud83c\udfd5 . I said nothing. I certainly did not gaslight him to make him feel guilty. That's quite manipulative and a bit abusive. There is certainly no need for that.\n\nWe are also in our 50s, recently married, but have known each other since our teens. I certainly did not bring up the fact that we are older now, still hike but not like we used to, or the fact that we live in Canada where our summers are very short for such an expensive purchase to be sitting in the basement for many months out of the year.  It's also huge for only 2 people. \n\nIn fact, we have camped so often using this tent, that I actually love it. It's huge but he can stand up on it, so it's more comfortable. It has brought us some very great memories together. \n\nThe fact is, I knew the purchase made him happy. As his partner, I actually want him happy.  \n\nYou have a right to your money and do what you wish to make yourself happy too. We all work hard. If you can't get a little trinket to make you happy for all you have worked, what's the point? Sometimes, we need to spoil outlrselves, just a little. This is not like going to a mountain view spa every weekend. \n\nBefore we got married, we did not live together. There was a necklace I was eying. He actually encouraged me to get it. I was a single mom then (kids now grown and gone) money was tight. I felt guilty. Nobody made me feel this way but me.l but myself. This was not a necessity.  It was a want. Five years looking at this necklace...\n\nFor one time, I put myself first.\nBefore the kids, before bills, before all necessities. Yes, I spoiled myself. \n\nI got it. It has been around my neck now for three years, I've never taken it off.  I love it, and it has brought me much happiness. OP, if you are reading this...is there anything wrong with that? Seriously?", "Oh He\u2019s the asshole. It\u2019s not all joint money. You work hard, you put money in the joint account. You have THEEE RIGHT to enjoy your own money.

That said, effective communication is key to successful and lasting relationships. You shouldn\u2019t need to ask permission, however, sharing your plans with your partner can be beneficial. \n\nI wonder why he believes these are a waste of money. Surely he has personal expenditures one could label as frivolous, though aid caution against throwing that in his face. \n\nDo you think this is a power issue on his part? Does he likes to tell you what you should and shouldn\u2019t do in other aspects of your partnership? Do you have a set plan (budget) for your money? If so, does this include a personal for \u201cfun money\u201d that you can choose when/where to spend without feedback from the other? If not, I\u2019d encourage a discussion about finances, establishing a budget in the process. This will help as accountability for each other and reduce the chances for arguments stemming from expenditures.", "NTA. It's great to be able to save money. But what's the point of saving money if you're not able to enjoy things from time to time. Do not let your husband bully you into feeling bad about spending some of your hard earned money.

There is no age limit to enjoy any kind of jewelry or clothes.", "Question - have you previously agreed that you're saving for something in particular?\n\nDoes he ever buy stuff for himself?\n\nESH. \n\nJust because you've got more disposable income all of a sudden, doesn't automatically mean you get to spend it.\n\nHim treating you like shit after the fact is poor.\n\nAlso, like almost every other post on this sub can be resolved by having an adult conversation with your partner.", "NTA - If your joint bills are paid and it's your money that you earned then he has no say in what you spend it on.", "NTA. I want my partner to get everything they want.", "NTA -- It IS all joint money, which means she has just as much say over when/what/how much is spent.
