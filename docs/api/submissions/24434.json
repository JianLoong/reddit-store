She has been quiet on social media since it all happened, which I found interesting because her other sons and ex-husband were not shy to make any posts expressing their love for their son.\n\nToday is his birthday and as expected, the ex-husband writes a sweet facebook post along with many of her son's other friends. She has been silent all day and I have not seen anything from her. Truthfully, I know everyone grieves different, but to me it sends a bad message that she's been so silent but posting about her new boyfriend and the things they've been up to. It almost seems like she doesn't care about her son, but who am I to judge or really know what's going on behind the scenes.\n\nI messaged her telling her I'm thinking of her today and hope she's hanging in there and she responds back saying thank you with a heart. I then asked if she was going to make a post for him and she said that she was not. All I said in return is \"Just make sure people don't get the wrong idea that you don't care! I think it would be a really sweet tribute\"\n\nShe never responded, but one of our mutual friends called me basically screaming at me and calling me an AH and told me never to message my friend again and asked if I knew how much damage I caused sending that message.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691798810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15op8ej/aita_for_asking_my_friend_why_she_didnt_make_a/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Before social media, people just minded their own business. You should try it. You sound like a very small minded person.  It was so crass of you to bring this up, and especially gross to suggest that someone who lost their child very recently should spare a moment to care about other people's impression about how she chooses to spend her son's first birthday since his death.", "YIKES! Yes, YTA.\n\nYou're \"worried people will get the wrong idea?\" People only say that when they are the ones who feel that way.

How can you be so cruel?", "YTA!!! mind your own business?? the hell is wrong with you jesus christ", ">I know everyone grieves different, but to me it sends a bad message that she's been so silent but posting about her new boyfriend and the things they've been up to\n\nWow, YTA for sure.\n\nPeople bringing back up horrible feelings and publicly broadcasting them is not a positive sign at all.  If people want to drag out the process then fair enough, but negatively judging someone for trying to move on is just nasty.\n\n>It almost seems like she doesn't care about her son\n\nThe son is dead, there is no more \"caring for him\" as he doesn't exist to ferel that care.  There is missing him, there is pain and there is a lot of other things, but that chapter of her life is passed and it is very healthy for her to look forwards instead of backwards.\n\n>I messaged her telling her I'm thinking of her today and hope she's hanging in there\n\nGreat, so she is possibly trying to shield her heart from this pain and you've gone out of your way to pressure and push this onto her.  You chose to provoke someone where it hurts to make them do as you want or to force them to bleed publicly so you could witness their pain.  \n\n>I then asked if she was going to make a post for him and she said that she was not.\n\nSo she took your initial probe that was hidden behind \"concern\" and took it at face value.  Then once you'd opened the door you dropped that and then chose to confront her on not playing the publicly grieving mother.  Nasty, nasty, nasty behaviour.  I wouldn't do that to someone I hated, never mind someone I cared for.\n\n> All I said in return is \"Just make sure people don't get the wrong idea that you don't care! I think it would be a really sweet tribute\"\n\nBloody hell, a 3rd round after you were explicitly told no.  WTF is wrong with you.

And I'm speaking as a grieving mother as well, since my 35 year old son was shot and killed exactly 2 months ago and now I'm facing the trial for murder in the 2nd degree for the man that shot him. And I haven't posted about it on FB either, even though I frequently post about other things, like photos from my hikes, photos I took of a lightning storm we had the other day, and I'm dog sitting right now so posting funny pics of the dogs. My FB page probably looks relatively normal... unless you've seen the one or two posts where I posted that he had passed, but not the how and why of it. \n\nThe truth is, I'm an absolute freaking mess and everyday is a struggle to hold it together. But if you ask anyone who sees me, they'd possibly think either I'm holding it together really well, or even that I'm somewhat cold and unemotional. The truth is I cry myself to sleep every night and walk around most of the time feeling like I'm going to vomit any minute. I don't feel the need to share my pain on FB for all the world to see. Especially because I don't want questions or to have to explain what's going on, or how I'm feeling. Or even worse, have to deal with cruel comments about the situation. And I guarantee, there is always someone who feels the need to make some judgmental asshole comment.\n\nThe normal and happy stuff I'm currently posting on FB is one of the few things that is anchoring me and giving me some semblance of \"normal\", even though my world will never ever be normal or right again.\n\nYou have no idea what she is going through and you're a complete asshole to assume \"it sends a message\" just because YOU would make attention-seeking posts about your pain and loss.

It truly sucks that people think if you don\u2019t publicize something on social media then something is wrong.  Your friend lost her son and is grieving and you\u2019re concerned about what people might think?

I'm sure she's spending her day of remembrance in a much more meaningful way-- with people she loves and cares about around her for comfort, than wasting her time typing up some tribute to share on social media for likes and hug emojis. I can't believe you had the audacity to confront her about it and insinuate that it makes her look bad for not doing it.", "YTA. Social media is not real life.", "YTA, you know that every waking minute of her life she must feel an amount of emptiness since her loss.
