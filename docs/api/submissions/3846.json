My mom is married to Henry and Henry has a daughter who is the same age as me (15). I used to split time equally between both houses but I prefer my dad's so I was able to get it so I only need to spend one weekend a month at my mom's house. Ever since mom and Henry got married 5 years ago it's been less comfortable at my mom's. She expects me and Henry's daughter Emma to be besties or some shit. She has invited Emma to join me and my friends a lot, she has tried to get my dad to invite Emma over to our house when I'm there and to include her in stuff my two best friends are included in. A few times I tried to tell my mom Emma wasn't invited by my friends to something or they wouldn't like random kids attending, but she claimed Emma was their friend too.\n\nThe truth is my friends and Emma have nothing in common and they never wanted her there. Neither did I. She has totally different interests than I do and despite my mom telling me we're sisters, I have never introduced her to anyone as my sister. She's not someone I care about if I'm honest. I don't hate her either but I would never choose to bring her along the way mom has forced me to over the years. Emma for the most part has always been glad to be included without needing to put herself out there since she's really quiet and introverted naturally.\n\nSo what happened is two weeks ago one of my friends had her 16th birthday party that was pretty fancy. Her parents started out taking us all to paintball and then they had a small water park rented out for three hours for the party. My mom knows the parents on Facebook and saw the photos of it. The friend whose birthday it was is one of the friends mom says Emma is friends with too. So she called the parents and asked why Emma wasn't invited. They said their daughter hadn't requested she be. Then mom went off on them and asked how they could turn down my request for Emma to attend. They told her I made no such request.\n\nSo last weekend I had to spend with my mom and she pulled me up on the party and not asking for Emma to be invited. I told her I didn't want to invite Emma. Which turned into mom asking why that one party after all these years. Then I yelled at her and told her I had never wanted to include Emma but she made me and it was never my choice. Then mom started in on making my friends choose between me and Emma and how unfair it is because they've known me longer and I told her she was wrong, that Emma had no friends and never had any because mom tried to give her mine without asking if they wanted to be her friends. I told her she had no right to force this shit on us and how not one of my friends had ever actually invited Emma to anything or sought her out to include her and that mom did all the work.\n\nMom told me I was behaving like a bully, she called me cruel and said I couldn't tell my own mother that she's wrong. Then she yelled at me for yelling at her.

Your mother is pretty clueless. I wonder, for how many more years is she going to be so interfering and trying to force this friendship on you when you\u2019ve already said no? It all sounds so odd.\n\nIs if possible to have the arrangement changed so you don\u2019t have to spend any time at your mother\u2019s?", "NTA If anyone is bullying it is your Mom. You are not your step sister emotional support animal. If anything Emma should be in counseling to learn how to make her own friends, gain confidence. and become independent.\n\nMy adult daughter is an introvert and I raised her to be independent. As a teenager she would go to the movies alone, and still does. She goes to restaurant by herself and eats alone. So do I. It is crippling to prop someone up their entire life. Emma needs to learn self confidence, and  how to be alone and if not enjoy it at least tolerate it. Some people prefer to be alone, it doesn't sound like this is the case with Emma or she wouldn't tag along with you. Someone needs to Parent Emma. It is easier for your mom to manipulate you into creating opportunities for Emma to socialize. Emma is too old for your mom to be setting up play dates for her. Your Mom should be encouraging Emma to join Clubs/Groups at school that interest her. She should look for opportunities outside of school too. The local library or recreation center might have activities or clubs. She may be able to volunteer at an animal rescue. Where I am you have to be 14. Maybe there is a class she would enjoy such as martial arts, dance, sewing, knitting. Your mom should look into what is available. Unfortunately I think your mom is lazy. Where is Emma's mom?", "NTA\n\nI really hope Emma was not home when you had that fight, that is the only reason I would lean everyone sucks otherwise NTA\n\nEdit:op said Emma wasn't home at the time so NTA", "NTA. Your mom and stepdad should have let the two of you get to know each other on your own terms and your mom has not been considering you and your needs in this. She is wrong and it's about time she hears it. You have the right to express how you feel. Perhaps you can write to your mum if she won\u2019t listen and ask your dad to talk to her. It is sad that Emma doesn\u2019t have friends but this is not the way to help her.", "NTA\n\nI have to say I feel bad for Emma, not because you're obligated to be her \"bestie\" or invite her to everything you do. Even if she were your real sister that would be an over-the-top expectation from your mom. It sounds like Emma would be just as happy being left out of this herself. She should have her own life instead of your mom trying to tell her who she should be friends with. My guess is anytime she spent with you and your friends was intensely uncomfortable for her even if she tried to be polite about it. I say that as an introvert myself.\n\nTBH it sounds like your mom is just desperate to get Emma out of the house so she can be alone with the new hubby.", "IMO, you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s just a suck situation. My sister and I are 6 years apart, which made it difficult to relate to each other. I was graduating highschool when she was entering middle school. My mom tried to force me to take her places with my own friends, and I would ALWAYS be pissed about it because all of my friends are my age. Even though my sister and I get along better now, (I\u2019m 31 and she is 25) it was difficult to \u201cbe friends\u201d when we were young because of the age gap.\n\nIn your case, you have different interests than Emma. Does Emma want to hang out with you ever? Maybe you could do something with her without your friends if you choose? When parents try to force relationships between family members, it never helps the situation it only causes resentment.", "NYA your mom is a bully and is trying to force a relationship with you sand your stepsister which in itself is a recipe for disaster. What you feel is valid . Your mother obviously cares about Emma but this is not how to ideally raise a child by forcing her other child and everyone around her to \"have fun\"", "NTA. Your mom sounds like she is trying to force a friendship. None of your friends seem to like Emma, and you do not consider her your sister. It is beyond me why your mom wants to force this.", "NTA. I feel bad for Emma but your mom is delusional. Also, I\u2019m sure Emma is grateful to be included but it also sucks being forced somewhere when nobody actually wants you there. Idk if Emma actually considers your friends her friends, she must suspect something is up when they don\u2019t go out of their way to hang out with her- but this feels more like your mother is the bully in Emma\u2019s life. I can\u2019t imagine that Emma is oblivious to everything. Maybe talk to her about it and your mothers behavior.", "I really just feel bad for Emma.", "NTA\n\nBut I feel bad for Emma for having to deal with that. You need some group counseling for sure", "NTA. Your family needs some group counseling, I hope you get help.", "ESH. I agree your mom shouldn't have forced you to include your stepsister in all your friends activities. However, you had no right to be so cruel. You don't have to like her. Hell, you don't even have to love her like a sister. But you still have at least have some courtesy. It's like you said, Emma is introverted and quiet, but still liked being included. Would it have been better if instead your mom phrased things as \"hey would it be OK to include Emma in this activity?\" yeah, no shit. After you all calm down, you need to apologize to your mom and step sister and calmly explain you don't like feeling like you're forced to include her in activities. Nobody likes being forced to do things, that's fair. But, you also wouldn't mind including her in things from time to time. I'm positive Emma also doesn't like that her step mom has to literally force her bio daughter to be nice to her. I've been the introvert parents force their spawn to be nice to, and it's not a good feeling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who th calls other parents and asks why their kid wasn\u2019t invited to a party?!? She delusional. No wonder you grew resentful.\n\nJust as an additional remark, if you did include your socially awkward sister, you would be a wonderful person because that\u2019s what good people are made of.

The only AH here is your mom.\n\nHer trying to force a relationship (with your and your friends) is only alienating her more.\n\nWhat does Emma think about your mom's meddling?  Does she go along with it to not offend her?  Is she scared of her?  Has her dad told her to listen?\n\nDoes Emma have any friends of her own?  I take it you either aren't in the same school but if you are, you aren't in the same class.  Does she have any other friends at all?\n\nPerhaps you need to suggest to Emma she needs to find a hobby that she is interested in.  This will expose her to people with the same interests and hopefully friendships will form from that.\n\nIf she is really struggling with social interactions and she isn't diagnosed with anxiety (or other mental health related stuff) or appears to have any of them... then she may be neurodiverse and it's just her.

Both of you deserve better.", "well if she does not want to go, or have any idea about it, your mom is insane for wanting her to go! I mean shes not even friends with the people there!", "No, her mom isn't in the picture.", "So, it seems your mom has wanted to be her surrogate so badly that she has even tried to choose her friend.
