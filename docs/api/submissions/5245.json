Also, why is she using your en suite bathroom and not the guest one?", "NTA maybe I\u2019m paranoid but that just all really seems like she was trying to get bf to try to comfort her while she was naked. 3 times in fact.", "I thought this was going to be a \u201cdidn\u2019t think anyone was home\u201d accident. Your sister went back for thirds.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t need that mess looking for trouble in your house. Let mom and dad deal with it. Giving a side eye to your bf for the \u201coverreacted\u201d.", "NTA.  Sounds like your sister is a master at piss-takes.    My guess is she is loving all the drama her naked romps have triggered.", "NTA. You are not asking too much. Not being naked in-front of your bf is a very reasonable and normal request. Super strange that people would even not get that? Sounds like gaslighting to me.", "NTA. She was baiting your bf. She needed to get out.", "Your sister was trying to create drama with your husband.  Her behavior is abnormal and dangerous.  I would worry about false accusations against him by her.", "NTA - tell your parents to stop brown nosing your sisters ass and it doesn\u2019t matter what they think because she\u2019s officially staying at their house or in the streets their choice \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. ask your boyfriend how he would feel if his brother/ friend did that would he be okay with that? Would that be considered a overreaction? Clearly your sister wanted to flirt or try to get a reaction from your boyfriend but she didn\u2019t expect to get thrown out into the streets lol and I\u2019m sure your parents are mad because they raised a loose woman who tried to flirt with her sister\u2019s boyfriend and are now stuck with her again at the house.", "NTA - Nope. It was a violation of both you and your bf boundaries. She doesn\u2019t even seem to be sorry.", "NTA.  Your sister is way too entitled.  Given an apartment she is remodeling, she can stay there.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents are pretty bad as well for blaming you for that.", "NTA.   And what the heck is wrong with your parents blaming you!!! I\u2019m", "NTA. She\u2019s not home and knew what she was doing. Kudos to your boyfriend!", "NTA. It\u2019s sounds like she did it on purpose. I can understand MAYBE once (on \u201caccident\u201d), but three times? She knew he was out there, yet she chose to walk out naked. At that age, girls tend to have issues with their self-esteem, and they will look for attention, even if it\u2019s not always appropriate. She was hoping to get your boyfriend riled up. She could always put the blame on him if it got out of control\u2026 \u201cHe was older, and should know better.\u201d You did the right thing. Don\u2019t let anyone else tell you otherwise. Because if she gets away with it once, then, most likely it will happen again.", "NTA. Your sister was walking  around in the buff in frront of your BF on purpose. She can say what she wants but this is unacceptable. She was a guest in your apartment and should have been respectful of that. You did the right thing. Mom and dad are mad because they are now stuck with her.", "NTA. I am assuming she noticed your boyfriend before she walked in and out three times. Where is she getting the money for an apartment and to fully renovate it at 18? No overreaction in my opinion.", "NTA, you should tell your bf that he\u2019s already on thin ice for not \u201ctelling her to stop\u201d himself after the first time she walked out naked\u2026", "NTA", "NTA what the heck? Does she have no concept of boundaries or social norms at all? What a weird thing to do. I\u2019m surprised your boyfriend was okay with her doing that. If my husband\u2019s brother or sister did this I would be so uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nTo me this sounds like a stages breakdown and was hoping your bf would console her.\n\nHis assessment of her sounds correct.", "You know your sister better than me. I dunno if she\u2019s clueless or wants to start drama/something with your BF. \n\nBut as for how you acted, NTA. It\u2019s your place and she did something completely outside social norms. If you wanted you could give her another chance while laying down clear boundaries (and not rely on her clueless nature/judgment). But even if you didn\u2019t want to do that, it doesn\u2019t make you the AH", "Wait.... you let your sister stay w you and she walked naked in front of your brother 3x?? Who does this? Not even once is an accident.  NTA.", "NTA. I would never trust her.", "NTA. Your sis was actively flirting with your BF and she basically threw herself at him. \n\nI honestly think you should find another BF too because mf himself should have laid down the healthy boundaries law. \n\nThis stinks to high holy hell of infidelity!", "NTA. Is this even real?", "Your parents didn\u2019t correct this behavior when it would happen u see their roof. So you under your roof should of pulled her to the side and talk to her and explain to her this is unacceptable. Not everyone Has common sense.", "NTA\n\nDoes she have borderline personality disorder or something?", "NTA you don't accidentally walk around naked in front of other people repeatedly while a guest in their home.  Either sister is making moves on boyfriend or trying to cause problems in your relationship.  Either way she needed to be kicked out of your home.", "NTA Three times ? She's up to no good .", "NTA. She was doing some seriously sketchy attention seeking to your bf. Glad you kicked that snake out!", "I mean some people really are just clueless but also she clearly has zero idea about healthy boundaries. I think NAH just a sister who needed a serious reality check.", "Nta also your boyfriend wants to sleep with your sister. Cause how could he not find that uncomfortable and still want her around.

Kinda feel like this is one of those things that you should talk about before just kicking someone out, was there a conversation earlier about not doing this and she ignored that conversation? Did you talk about it right before kicking her out and she said she wouldn't try to not do it? Some people are seriously just pretty clueless about random stuff", "My point exactly. She just likes the drama.", "Yeah the \"forgot\" something three times was a bit extra and stood out to me too. Who tf uses someone's bedroom bathroom when there is a guest bathroom?

Boundaries only work when they're actually discussed, they aren't the same for everyone...", "And causing drama\u2026 was she really crying in the shower or was it all a ruse to get BF to \u201ccomfort\u201d her?
