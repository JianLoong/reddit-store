Is she still your \"friend\"?", "This sounds like my head wtf", "Hahaha definitely!", "Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with that?\n\nMy point is not \"it's okay to disregard boundaries\" my point is that boundaries actually have to be set to be understood.\n\n It's okay to have a different view point blank, not just in your own home, it's just also important to recognize the comfort levels of other people in regards to their own views and change your own behavior around that (or avoid those people too ig), but you can't recognize that without knowledge of that. If OP had a conversation where they said \"hey don't walk around naked mid shower\" than the sister is very much in the wrong for completely disregarding that, and I never said I was directly say taking the sisters side here, nor did I say I was against OP. As I said in my original comment, it depends, point there being the word \"depends\". Not all situations are actually set up between two people where one is completely in thew wrong and one is innocent in the situation, sometimes people just aren't compatible or communication hasn't been great, communication and boundaries are a two way street, not a one way. You can't disregard other people's boundaries, but you also can't expect people to mind read and know your own boundaries before you set them. Like shoes! If I walk into someone else's house I'll take my shoes off, other people thought when they come into my house, do not do that, because they live in houses where they don't do that, and didn't think about whether I would or not. So, if I forget to tell someone before they walk into the house I just give a little \"oh hey could you take your shoes off? I forgot to tell you to do so earlier, but I'd appreciate it if you could do it now\" or I try to combat the issue before it happens by saying it as they enter the house. Walking around naked and wearing shoes inside are different things, but, in regards to boundaries in other people's homes I feel like shoes are a commonly discussed one so that's why I'm using it. I can't fault someone for walking into my living area wearing shoes if they keep shoes on in their house and have other friends who also keep shoes on inside, it's just a cultural difference that we have to remind each other of, and then next time they come over they can do it without having to be told- but point still stands they did have to get told the first time.", "Not that big of ups. He still stayed in the room during sis's passbys AND is telling OP she overreacted....", "There's nothing wrong with having a crush on someone.

That is what I was worried about.", "The first time he thinks it's an honest mistake, the second time he feels uncomfortable, the third time he believes there's a problem and tells his GF.

An adult shouldn't require being told to respect other people. You may be proud of your body and have every right to feel that way, but you don't have the right to show it to people who aren't comfortable seeing it. The person who wants to be naked is the one responsible for being \"uncomfortable\" or initiating any conversation on the topic.", "Yep.  He's not guilty, here, but he's also not that innocent.", "Nah...it was his room and trying to get some \ud83d\udca4   he had no way of knowing sister crazy was going to keep walking out naked.", "I can ALMOST get behind that reasoning. But there just one thing. She decided she was going to take a shower in their PERSONAL bathroom in their room. And he still laid up in the bed. Something not right with that picture. It\u2019s too familiar for me.", "Again, different people have different boundaries, sometimes people are fine with nudity in familial and non sexual situations, some people extend their views of family to their family members significant others, other people don't. Like it's still dependent just because you see something as a typical boundary doesn't actually mean everyone does. \n\nEspecially because OP mentioned that walking out of a shower naked has been known as a common behavior of the sister, it isn't like this is a random one off occurrence where the sister has never walked out nude before but did it just because, it's a known behavior, and it's known that the sister does not care about it nor does she have problems with it. I'd see where you're coming from if this was a new development, but within their life time it's obviously not. \n\nThe whole being an \"adult\" thing also doesn't really like, apply to an 18 year old in a situation that has to do with planning and social behavior moderation, beyond that though I again, did not actually say that she has to be told to respect boundaries, typically people learn how to respect boundaries when they're younger than she is, the average person knows to respect boundaries adult or non adult. The issue here though again, is that I'm not talking about whether she respected boundaries or not, but about if she knows what those boundaries actually are in the first place. Once she knows she should respect them.", "He clearly knew 3+ times.  What are you talking about??", "You keep repeating yourself as if you think nobody understands what you're saying. Yes, *some* people would be ok with this. However, the *vast* majority would NOT be ok with this. The couple might not have any issue with nudity, *if it were not a relative*. \n\nIf you bring the perspective of the minority, it is incumbent upon the person who is the outlier to conform or risk consequences. The sister knows it is not standard operating procedure to be naked in front of others, regardless of how oblivious and nonchalant she may act. She didn't go to school naked, she doesn't go to work naked (even if she gets naked for work, she doesn't show up that way) and understands clearly why that is.\n\nPointing out why the sister is wrong \u2260 denying that the sister has a valid perspective that is held by many people in regards to nudity. It is not wrong to walk around naked in your own home or in a place where everyone is comfortable with it. It *is* wrong to do it when you're a guest in someone's home who is doing you a favor without being explicitly clear that it is acceptable for you to do so. That burden doesn't fall on the host, period. \n\nDo you walk into someone's house and drink from the carton? Pee in their shower? Reach into containers with your bare hands? I hope not.

Maybe you just need to try to speak with her calmly for her side of the story?\n\nYeah, it seems pretty fishy and deliberate, but at least try to talk to her about it.", "Nope, NTA. This is probably the stupidest activity I've ever seen anyone do. Walking around someone ELSE's house naked? No. Absolutely **not!** \n\nShe definitely didn't \"forget\" something 3x.

I'm betting he doesn't want to cause family drama but he's already told her in the past he's not interested and to pack it in. Think back on her behaviour around him, any chance she had some deluded fantasy that she'd move into this flat and steal your man on the way, and that's why it has to be now rather than when school finishes?

She might - quite reasonably - be less tolerant of this sort of mistake than him. That doesn't make him wrong for not immediately reaching for the tar and feathers himself.\n\nAs for your \"not a good look for him\" comment, if he really did secretly enjoy the show, why did he say anything to his partner?

Esp when your bf is laying down! Between the crying & the walking past your bf, i would assume she was trying to get him to notice/comfort her.", "NTA-- she sounds manipulative.  She shouldn't have used the ensuite bathroom, especially with your boyfriend in the bedroom.  And the going back and forth 3 TIMES seemed like a way to make sure he saw her naked.  She sounds abominable.  Your family shouldn't enable her.", "Reddit emphasizes one of those **WAY** more heavily though.\n\nFalse rape claims only account for about 2% of all rape claims.  From the way reddit talks about it, you'd think 98%.", "I suppose so but my impression is that the majority of redditors who live in apartments in the USA are renting.
