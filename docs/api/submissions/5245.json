No need to waste time talking, you both know what she was doing. Good decision booting her out.", "NTA but also your bf is giving \ud83d\udea9for saying you\u2019re overreacting. Kinda feels like he told you to cover himself but why would he just sit there and watch her walk by three times without saying anything to her or closing the door? Idk girl, seems fishy", "Nta.

It sounds like she was doing it to get your boyfriends attention and walked out naked 3 times hoping he would stop her to ask what\u2019s wrong.\n\nShe probably didn\u2019t expect your boyfriend to tell you either.\n\nAlso why is she using your bathroom ? \n\nWhy would he stay in the bedroom if she was in your shower ? After the 1st time she walked out, He should\u2019ve left.\n\nYou did the right thing, let her walk around naked In your parents house.\n\nDon\u2019t leave them alone anymore.

She's an 18 yo woman. Let her be naked any time she wants.", "You got me", "Your house your rules? Did OP specifically tell her little sister, \"don't walk naked out of the shower\"?", "Yesssss.  Maybe the third one was the charm", "It's literally his house and she's the one doing the weird thing? Why would he have to move?", "Oh also, I feel like with how many times she got out of the shower without drying off, the ground would be SOAKED.

Naw dude.", "Does she like drama or are you just an \u201cinsecure freak\u201d? Sorry, that was just a hilarious way to project whatever\u2019s going on within her.

He wants her to stay?? Nta and I would watch interactions going forward", "He could have just told her to use the guest bathroom as soon as she came into wanting to use theirs.", "Yeah, this is like a cheap, overused porn video plot.  There was no \"drama\": little sis just wanted the older sister's boyfriend.  NTA, but I'd keep an eye on your boyfriend.", "I wondered if anyone would say something... 18 and getting an apartment (I'm sure she isn't paying for) and renovating after not even living there? Sounds like such a hard life.", "I had a friend that tried to go into my bathroom when my husband was in the shower to get qtips. I told him to lock the door because I knew she had a crush on my husband but it was really brave of her to do it on front of her husband and children even though there was a brand new pack of Qtips in her bathroom. She even went as far as telling me that my husband was gay because he didn't notice her. She was extremely offended when I said that he only had eyes for me.", "They could, but it wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining.", "Oh absolutely. Very possible there\u2019s no where to avoid her but there\u2019s probably somewhere better to be than the bedroom she\u2019s showering in. Where there\u2019s very intention proximity. At least if he was in the kitchen he could turn away or anything other than letting her continue this game.", "Ugh this too!! This is such a bizarre story\ud83e\udd22", "I had upvoted until \"say BF was trying to take advantage of her\".  Rape victims have enough problems-- don't add theoretical ones.", "I\u2019m out of free awards u/Abeggychooser but man if you didn\u2019t call it like it is.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6", "Why would you be friends with this person?", "What in the world? Is she still your \"friend\"?", "This sounds like my head wtf", "Hahaha definitely!", "Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with that?\n\nMy point is not \"it's okay to disregard boundaries\" my point is that boundaries actually have to be set to be understood.\n\n It's okay to have a different view point blank, not just in your own home, it's just also important to recognize the comfort levels of other people in regards to their own views and change your own behavior around that (or avoid those people too ig), but you can't recognize that without knowledge of that. If OP had a conversation where they said \"hey don't walk around naked mid shower\" than the sister is very much in the wrong for completely disregarding that, and I never said I was directly say taking the sisters side here, nor did I say I was against OP. As I said in my original comment, it depends, point there being the word \"depends\". Not all situations are actually set up between two people where one is completely in thew wrong and one is innocent in the situation, sometimes people just aren't compatible or communication hasn't been great, communication and boundaries are a two way street, not a one way. You can't disregard other people's boundaries, but you also can't expect people to mind read and know your own boundaries before you set them. Like shoes! If I walk into someone else's house I'll take my shoes off, other people thought when they come into my house, do not do that, because they live in houses where they don't do that, and didn't think about whether I would or not. So, if I forget to tell someone before they walk into the house I just give a little \"oh hey could you take your shoes off? I forgot to tell you to do so earlier, but I'd appreciate it if you could do it now\" or I try to combat the issue before it happens by saying it as they enter the house. Walking around naked and wearing shoes inside are different things, but, in regards to boundaries in other people's homes I feel like shoes are a commonly discussed one so that's why I'm using it. I can't fault someone for walking into my living area wearing shoes if they keep shoes on in their house and have other friends who also keep shoes on inside, it's just a cultural difference that we have to remind each other of, and then next time they come over they can do it without having to be told- but point still stands they did have to get told the first time.", "Not that big of ups. He still stayed in the room during sis's passbys AND is telling OP she overreacted....", "There's nothing wrong with having a crush on someone. Trying to seduce your friend's husband is what makes it turn into have a friend to HAD a friend.", "\"Had\", past tense.", "Yes. That is what I was worried about.", "The first time he thinks it's an honest mistake, the second time he feels uncomfortable, the third time he believes there's a problem and tells his GF. I can see him not wanting to cause friction between two sisters and maybe second-guessing his responses due to that.", "Except certain things, say nudity in front of your sister's SO, don't require a conversation ahead of time because it's *incredibly rare* for this situation to be ok. An adult shouldn't require being told to respect other people. You may be proud of your body and have every right to feel that way, but you don't have the right to show it to people who aren't comfortable seeing it. The person who wants to be naked is the one responsible for being \"uncomfortable\" or initiating any conversation on the topic.", "Yep.  He's not guilty, here, but he's also not that innocent.", "Nah...it was his room and trying to get some \ud83d\udca4   he had no way of knowing sister crazy was going to keep walking out naked.", "I can ALMOST get behind that reasoning. But there just one thing. She decided she was going to take a shower in their PERSONAL bathroom in their room. And he still laid up in the bed. Something not right with that picture. It\u2019s too familiar for me.", "Again, different people have different boundaries, sometimes people are fine with nudity in familial and non sexual situations, some people extend their views of family to their family members significant others, other people don't. Like it's still dependent just because you see something as a typical boundary doesn't actually mean everyone does. \n\nEspecially because OP mentioned that walking out of a shower naked has been known as a common behavior of the sister, it isn't like this is a random one off occurrence where the sister has never walked out nude before but did it just because, it's a known behavior, and it's known that the sister does not care about it nor does she have problems with it. I'd see where you're coming from if this was a new development, but within their life time it's obviously not. \n\nThe whole being an \"adult\" thing also doesn't really like, apply to an 18 year old in a situation that has to do with planning and social behavior moderation, beyond that though I again, did not actually say that she has to be told to respect boundaries, typically people learn how to respect boundaries when they're younger than she is, the average person knows to respect boundaries adult or non adult. The issue here though again, is that I'm not talking about whether she respected boundaries or not, but about if she knows what those boundaries actually are in the first place. Once she knows she should respect them.", "He clearly knew 3+ times.  What are you talking about??", "You keep repeating yourself as if you think nobody understands what you're saying. Yes, *some* people would be ok with this. However, the *vast* majority would NOT be ok with this. The couple might not have any issue with nudity, *if it were not a relative*. \n\nIf you bring the perspective of the minority, it is incumbent upon the person who is the outlier to conform or risk consequences. The sister knows it is not standard operating procedure to be naked in front of others, regardless of how oblivious and nonchalant she may act. She didn't go to school naked, she doesn't go to work naked (even if she gets naked for work, she doesn't show up that way) and understands clearly why that is.\n\nPointing out why the sister is wrong \u2260 denying that the sister has a valid perspective that is held by many people in regards to nudity. It is not wrong to walk around naked in your own home or in a place where everyone is comfortable with it. It *is* wrong to do it when you're a guest in someone's home who is doing you a favor without being explicitly clear that it is acceptable for you to do so. That burden doesn't fall on the host, period. \n\nDo you walk into someone's house and drink from the carton? Pee in their shower? Reach into containers with your bare hands? I hope not. Those are things you do in your own home with your own things. If you have to be told not to do them, you're a disrespectful and entitled jerk."]}
