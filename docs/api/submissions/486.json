I switched my major 3 times and have health issues that have interfered with my ability to succeed socially and academically since childhood, so im behind in getting a well payed job and rely on my parents for a place to live, though I do work part time so as to not be completely reliant. I am blessed that I dont have to pay rent and that I can focus on finishing my degree to leave home to stand on my own two feet. Now, I have a younger brother who is in boarding school and on some weekends my mom will bring him back home from school. Its often not communicated to us that either me or my older brother (28) need to take him back to school until the moment we need to leave. Bear in mind its 2 hours round trip. It was 11am on a sunday morning that they text and say can you please take your brother back to school. I told them that on Sundays I usually have homework due but thta I will gladly pick him up on fridays and my brother (28) can take him back on sundays. Now my brother is not reliable when it comes to family help, he rarely ever responds to his phone, and tends to be avoidant. He will pay me to do errands because he knows that I tend to do the bulk of it. I discussed with my brother that I have hw due on Sundays and he agreed that he can take our younger bro back on those days. \n\nTonight, I get a text at 6:30 from my dad asking \u201cwho is taking ___ back to school\u201d while Im working. I get why my dad cannot take him now, but I communicated before that I cant on sundays. My younger brother is on a time crunch as he needs to be back at school at 10 pm so im on the spot because my older brother will not respond to the text. I am left to deal with it. I talk to my dad in person and an argument ensues. I tell him that I cant as I have hw to finish up. He gets an annoyed tone and responds \u201cyou guys need to plan these things better\u201d and I am irked as I have said my availability before yet am still asked at the last minute. I let him know that weve discussed this before. His response to me is \u201chow do you expect me to remember a text about this? You dont pay rent, you dont pay for your car and you cant just do this?\u201d. Hes not wrong, but I feel he uses this as an excuse to spring up urgent requests on me without caring about my availability, as I am not always available. I do tend to usually accommodate because I am also aware of my dependency and do wish to be of useful to the home. But, here it felt unfair for him to tell me those things so that I would feel guilty and serve him regardless of what I have to do. He gets angry that I say \u201cits being sprung up on me\u201d but given what I said in the past for my availability he actually is springing it up. It doesnt feel like he respects me to communicate efficiently or with preparatory notices for important things. If I am communicated to properly, even if I am annoyed I will suck it up and do it as I know I am dependent.\n\nIdk.

Because to me it feels as if my parents should feel more of a duty to make sure that there is a system set in place to make sure their youngest son is back at school when he needs to be. It feels that they should do more to communicate to the people they want to taxi him back, that they will be available to do so and that they should communicate preemptively before the last second. Before I communicated my availability and my younger brother was at home, it was always an elephant in the room of who would take him back when it was approaching his time to go back to school. They would suddenly say that me or my older brother can, without even checking with us if we could.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
