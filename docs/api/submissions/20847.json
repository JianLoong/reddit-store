Who texts a new number without starting with \"Hi this is SearchAppz your sister asked me to send you this list for the party planning\"? Blocking a random message from a random number was a fair and predictable outcome of her failure to follow normal protocol. But having learned of the misunderstanding, it was bizarre to lie about it and inviting someone to text you again from a blocked number also has a predictable outcome. OP guaranteed that important information would be lost for a second time. There was one more opportunity  to get the info and OP blew that too. C'mon, you really are blaming your sister for only saying one time that she didn't want sugar? (A) you were supposed to be taking notes. She shouldn't have to repeat it unless you ask her to. (B) I bet it was at least the 3rd time that request had been communicated to youz but you chose to block the others. \n\nIt you didn't want to help, you should have just declined. Taking on a commitment ( to your nieces and nephews, no less!) requires follow through. Learn how to say no.

It's a bit confusing, but it seems as if you agreed to help your sister plan a party, not your sister *and* her friend. It's an AH move to tack on another mom for you to deal with without asking you. \n\nThat said, you need to speak up and let them know you didn't know what the other mom's text message was about and that you only agreed to help your sister with your niece/nephew's party, not both of them.", "ESH. Wow! So many YTA! I dont  get it. Everyone is an AH ..  the blocking of her # was obviously a mistake but we get so many spam and weird numbers that I was not shocked by that. If they were concerned they should have made sure you had the correct list. Did they follow up? How about a call? If it\u2019s that important I would never rely on just a text. Also you owed your sister a favor so she just bows out of the rest of the planning? Did you owe her friend a favor also? This whole situation was a bunch of people passing the buck or putting their head in the sand. You all messed up\u2026 on a side not, it\u2019s a party. There\u2019s always too much sugary stuff at a party. If it was that important they should have bought the food they wanted and left you with the rest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
