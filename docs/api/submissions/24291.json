She said she was hurting and felt she needed to have someone to talk to about it. I was still upset, but I understood. As I continued to find out about the other girls knowing, I was beside myself. I couldn\u2019t believe the person I trust more than anyone in the world would talk about my private issue that I was working through and trying to recover from, with others.

It's not fair for you to expect her to suffer without support. You need support, and so does she.\n\nYour wife has every right to seek out emotional support as well, and if that's through her friends that seems appropriate. \n\nI think YTA", "Question:\n\n1) IS she talking about YOUR problems (OP drinks his much, OP behaves like this, OP has said X and Y)\n\nOR\n\n2) Is she talking about what SHE is experiencing (I'm scared when my partner makes me feel unsafe, I'm worried if we're going to make it through this as a couple,  was this my fault, did I make him turn to alcohol?)\n\nYou mentioned your mothers, sisters, etc as a group she could talk to. Can she openly tell them if she was made to feel unsafe, is there was talk or consideration of divorce, can she REALLY talk about what the alcohol use did to HER as a person, and not be judged for it? If there was sexual issues through manipulations , or lack of intimacy, can she really tell your mother and sister and get support through that? \n\nTalking to her friends may give her the space to talk about things she can't tell your mothers and sisters without her causing issues in your marriage and in your familial relationships with them.\n\nIt's easy to say she should keep it to herself, but you may not have any idea AS YET what she has been through. I m so glad you're getting help and support, but she also needs help and support through this.\n\nSo ask yourself if you're really hurt about the fact that she is talking to her friends, or if you're trying to do damage control about people knowing exactly what your wife went through.\n\nHer seeking support DOES NOT MEAN that she is throwing you under the bus.", "YTA. Alcoholism affects everyone who lives with the alcoholic. That\u2019s why there are organizations like Al-Anon. Your wife was talking to her friends about her pain and frustration.", "Good for you for getting help for your alcoholism. I hope in time the shame is lessened and that you are on the road to recovery.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t something that is just about you\u2014the spouse of an addict needs support. It\u2019s not fair or reasonable for you to expect her to keep it entirely to herself. It must be extremely difficult to be married to someone with substance abuse issues. Hopefully her friends are sympathetic and discreet, but she needs support.", "You are looking at it wrong. Your wife was also suffering from your addiction. You were never alone in it since you married her. That's like saying \"hey, you can't tell anyone else about your cancer!\" Use your embarassment to never let it happen again, and be thankful she is still there.\n\nHonestly, you think other people didn't know, though?\n\nETA: YTA, but I am proud of you for being strong enough to fight alcoholism. Keep going!", "As the sister of someone who has also been hospitalized for addiction, you have no idea what she is going through/has been through. There were days where I was terrified to see a family member\u2019s name calling bc I was convinced they were calling to tell me my sibling was dead. She can\u2019t talk to you about it bc she doesn\u2019t want you to feel incredibly guilty and lose her relationship with you, but she has to process it. I am so thankful for my support system when my sister was a mess and I thought I was going to lose a person I love.", "Oh this is a tough one. I totally respect your wishes to keep a very challenging thing private and I can also see how your wife needs people to lean on.\n\nI think talking to friends for the purpose of seeking support and advice is very different from gossiping, which I take to mean spreading information on the basis of generating entertainment. So in this case I think your wife probably isn\u2019t talking to her friends about it for the sake of gossip, more so feeling lost and needing some understanding. \n\nIt gets tricky though that you asked her to stop and you found that it hasn\u2019t. But I wonder if the reason the other girlfriends know is because the first friend brought it up?\n\nEither way I think it\u2019s something to talk about because I think your wife does need and is entitled to her network of support, but your needs in that also have to be considered. \n\nSo I\u2019m gonna say NAH - this is hard for everyone and I think there are good intentions on both sides. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through all of this though, and I wish you the best OP", "YTA. I say this as an alcoholic in recovery. Your spouse needs and DESERVES support. \n\nGood on you for getting help: that's huge and I'm proud of you. But your alcoholism doesn't just affect you, and I guarantee you she isn't talking to them about it for funsies. You need to respect that she's going to need to talk about it.", "It's not fair to ask her to shoulder this alone. \n\nSo many people stay in bad situations because they don't realize how bad it is...until they talk to someone outside of it. The studies on social support speak for themselves. I understand privacy, but when alcohol use becomes so detrimental that it affects your life, it's affected her too.", "I\u2019m almost 9 years sober and I totally get that you\u2019re feeling a bit betrayed but you really need to look at this from a different perspective. \n\nYou have to remember what your wife has gone through and is still going through. You\u2019re so very lucky she stuck around. Do you remember the lying, hiding booze and general disrespect that you had for anything other than drinking? Your wife does and she has every right to talk about it with whomever she chooses. Whether she admits it or not she has been through hell. And YOUR drinking caused it. Do you really think that your drinking was a secret? It wasn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re going through some huge changes my friend. In time, you\u2019re going to realize that your efforts to talk about it are more important than your ego. Our egos are what made us drink. If you\u2019re worried about being made fun of by your friends well they\u2019re not really good friends. Your true friends will applaud your efforts. Your true friends won\u2019t belittle you or try to shame you. Your true friends will celebrate and acknowledge your sober milestones and anniversaries. \n\nIf you\u2019re in a program now you need to get a sponsor yesterday. Express these feelings with them. We have ALL gone through this. Time will help you heal because a newly sober person is dealing with some very raw emotions. \n\nYou\u2019re a lucky man to have a wife who stuck around. Just focus on that and realize that she\u2019s hurting too. Just like you. Many many marriages have not survived this disease be grateful that yours has. Good luck my friend. Do this one day at a time and just worry about yourself and not others.\n\nEdit; grammar", "ESH. I think she should have used more discretion but it\u2019s also not fair if you to expect her to shoulder the burden of being married to an alcoholic without any support for her. You guys need to work out a list of people she can talk freely with. I\u2019m pretty sure her dealing with you being an alcoholic is so the tougher burden than your embarrassment over ppl knowing the truth", "YTA.\n\nPeople will talk to friends about difficulties in their lives. Anyone who says that these conversations should only be had with therapists are delusional. \n\nIf she was making fun of you to them, or complaining about you maliciously then you have grounds to be upset. But she obviously needed places in her life to vent about something that she was helping you through. Her feelings matter to and a lot of her energy has gone into you and she needed a place that wasn't you to decompress.", "NAH- your wife needs support and the only option she feels she has is to talk with her friends.  Your addiction impacts her alot.\n\nYou are allowed to feel what you feel, but you need to make sure in the future you tell her to not spread it around.  You might also find out about support groups you both can attend to help you through this.\n\nAnd no, not everything that gets told to wives are told to husbands, you dont know everything her friends husbands are dealing with.", "YTA, \ud83d\udcaf. Being the partner of an alcoholic is an absolute nightmare. She needs to be able to talk about it and, frankly, so do you.", "YTA.\n\nYou have a problem that is obviously difficult for your wife. Obviously your wife will need to talk about it with her friends.", "YTA, your alcoholism immensely affects your wife\u2019s life, and she is allowed to talk about it.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like for her when you\u2019re drunk and you never will. I\u2019m sure she feels betrayed too sometimes.\n\nJust keep focusing on recovering, hopefully the shame won\u2019t hurt as bad one day. Don\u2019t worry about policing what she says, worry about improving yourself & your life together. \n\n**If she has secrets *that are hurting YOU*, then you should also tell your support systems.** (Kindly and quietly, if they are not malicious) Otherwise, they *are* private. But there is a huge difference.", "YTA but I understand what you're feeling. The problem is this secret isn't something that's just about you. As someone with several alcoholics in my life, it has a profound impact on the people around you as well. I don't want to assume but I imagine you may have done things or put her in scenarios that hurt her and there's just the general stress and worry and feeling alone. She probably needs someone to confide in and process those feelings. It's hard to do that with the person who probably feels awful about it, she probably doesn't want to hurt you either or make you feel bad.\n\nMaybe it would be beneficial to get her a therapist so she has someone she can work through this in a way that wouldnt make you uncomfortable. You might also want to consider that you guys may need an uncomfortable honest convo about how you both feel with some empathy from both sides.\n\nI think you can work through it.", "YTA. Your wife has stood by you through a difficult addiction and even hospitalization. It sounds like you have almost no empathy for what she is going through. It\u2019s natural and healthy for her to talk to her close friends about this. You may want to examine why you\u2019re so ashamed about your addiction that you\u2019d rather her suffer alone in silence.", "OP, I really don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting a lot of judgement for this reaction, because I\u2019d feel betrayed too. People keep secrets all the time, and you asked her to keep your secret. She\u2019s someone you should be able to trust the most. \n\nIf you\u2019re over your alcoholism and it no longer affects you or anyone else, I think being able to confide in your WIFE is important. If she told FIVE people about your situation, then she\u2019s just gossiping at this point. One or two would\u2019ve been understandable but five??? \n\nNo, you\u2019re NTA. \nAnd y\u2019all may rip me apart for this, but I legit do not care. They are valid in their feelings. My SO would NEVER tell a soul about my addiction struggles because he respects my privacy.", "Honestly I\u2019m astounded at the responses here.\n\nYour wife did not broach the subject with you. She did not in anyway inform you that she was telling 5 people about your painful struggle with alcohol. As a sober since 2003 alcoholic I know how tenuous the grip on sobriety can be and while it would\u2019ve be acceptable for her to see a therapist who is bound by confidentiality, she didn\u2019t choose to take that route.\n\nShe instead told not 1, not 2, but five people about your alcoholism and I\u2019m sorry, that goes well past \u201cshe needs support too\u201d and straight into \u201cshe doesn\u2019t respect your wishes and doesn\u2019t care how much harder she might be making this on you\u201d and that\u2019s inexcusable.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Holy balls. I\u2019m shocked at some of these responses. It doesn\u2019t matter how much support she needs: she does not get to share your confidential medical info with FIVE of her friends. (One bestie might\u2019ve been excusable and understandable. Five?)\n\nIf she needs support, she can find a therapist. Or she could\u2019ve griped to her circle of support *without* disclosing details (\u201cmy spouse has a medical issue that\u2019s stressing me out\u201d). Her need for support does not trump your right to privacy.", "NTA. This is a fundamental problem. You need to either seek professional help or find your way out of this marriage. \n\nAnd well done to you on recognizing that you have a problem and seeking out help for it. I hope for a healthy and happy future for you.", "Cut her some slack. What is more important is that you cut yourself some slack. It\u2019s not what you\u2019ve done, it\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. She\u2019ll share your triumphs proudly. Keep after it.", "NTA. I understand she wanted to talk with someone. one person? Sure, understandable, maybe this person will keep it between them, but 5???? She needs to talk to 5 different people about you? Is there a way for her to get into therapy? That way she talks about you and that info doesn\u2019t leave the room.", "YTA for not talking about her private shit w your friends, tbh.", "NTA. OP this is a red flag. you need to leave her NOW! she does NOT respect your privacy and that is not okay.", "NTA.\n\nThis is the sort of indiscretion that divorces are made of. I'd be looking into some couples therapy to see if the marriage can be saved.", "NTA. She betrayed you. Now you have to decide whether you are prepared to stay in a marriage where everything you do and say is reported to everybody you know. Wouldn't be me.", "Info: Is she utilizing a program like Alanon or private therapy to help her through this?", "NTA. Medical info needs to stay private. Too many think they can disclose your stuff because they are upset. They can NOT.", "One or two people makes perfect sense. She needs support. But yeah... 5 is a lot. NTA.", "NTA, if you hadn't already expressed that you were hurt and upset that she shared it with a friend I'd be more sympathetic to your wife, after all everyone needs to vent and discuss things that are difficult in their lives. BUT! She knew you weren't OK with it and has continued to tell all of her friends, who have absolutely shared it with their husbands after knowing that. That isn't ok IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!", "NTA\n\nShe had no business telling anyone that. I'm really sorry she did that too. If she was in the medical profession, she would have been guilty of violating HIPAA laws.", "NTA for being upset. Your feelings are valid. \n\nIs it safe to assume that you feel she could have brought it up with you? Like \u201chey I\u2019m struggling and I need a support system. How would you feel if I talked to Jan, Jen, and Joan?\u201d That\u2019s understandable. I don\u2019t like my status being talked about with others (like living with bipolar). If I\u2019m essentially blindsided with \u201chey I talked to 5 people about your issues\u201d then yea, I\u2019m going to have an upset reaction.", "NTA. A secret is a secret.\n\nI don't tell my wife the secrets other people tell me, and she shouldn't tell you her friends' secrets. Let alone, tell your secrets to others.", "NTA.  i guess when you stop telling her personal things, you can point out this exact reason.  tell her it is a basic cause and consequences.  you have the right to protect yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
