Evy isn\u2019t really a nice or pleasant person. She never wants to spend time with family and she really isn\u2019t appreciative of when we do nice things for her. Evy takes us for granted.\n\nWhen my parents have Evy come to anything, she complains and makes things very unpleasant for everyone else. But then when my parents respect her wishes and let her stay home (which is most of the time), then Evy tells others how she was \u201cabandoned\u201d at home and that she\u2019s the \u201cblack sheep\u201d of the family.\n\nI recently created an account on a social media app and Evy\u2019s account was recommended to me since her phone number\u2019s obviously in my list of contacts already.\n\nImportant to note: Evy\u2019s account was her real name and face, so anyone who saw the account would immediately know who she is (and therefore who me and my parents are.)\n\nI looked at Evy\u2019s account and saw that Evy had been posting lies about me (using my real name, by the way) and our parents. Evy basically wrote that we have narcissist parents, I\u2019m the golden child, and she\u2019s the black sheep/scapegoat. Her \u201cevidence\u201d for this was stories where she deliberately left out context to make my parents look bad and herself like a victim.\n\nOne example was her saying how I got to have twice as many extracurriculars as her, and got to go to extracurricular activities three times a week while she only got to go to one twice a month.\n\nI got two special lessons, one of them being speech therapy, which was a **need** and not an extracurricular, and my one actual extracurricular was art that cost $12 a lesson. Her extracurricular was horseback riding that cost over $100 a lesson. The money our parents spent on my art lessons every month wasn\u2019t even half the cost of Evy\u2019s horseback riding lessons.\n\nAnother example was her saying how our parents didn\u2019t show up to this specific event for her and that they never support her passions. Evy told our parents she would have to do something embarrassing at that event and specifically asked that they didn\u2019t come.\n\nI know I could have tried to talk to Evy about this or kept the information to myself. But I was pissed. So instead I told our parents and showed them what Evy had been posting.\n\nEvy and my parents got in a big fight where they basically called Evy out for skewing the truth online to get clout at our expense. They gave her an ultimatum of either posting a public apology, deleting her account, or moving out. Evy deleted her account.\n\nI vented about everything that happened to my friend Mia. Mia said she knew Evy was skewing the truth, but that I screwed up by telling our parents because I basically gave my sister no opportunity to explain her side or change on her own. Mia usually gives good advice/views into situations, so I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s right and I was the asshole for telling our parents.

She is a grown adult woman who has had many years to change and she needs to stop acting like a 14 year old child. Telling your parents was the right thing to do as she probably wouldn\u2019t have taken it down on her own anytime soon. I think she needs therapy to help her realize her actual situation.", "NTA. How is she gonna change on her own if she doesn't face the truth? She even choose to delete the account rather than tell the truth, so no, your friend is wrong.", "NTA - Evy wouldn't have changed if you had confronted her yourself, and may well have escalated in her lies. If she had been using pseudonyms that would have been one thing, but with your real names attached that's no joke! A 23 year old should know better!\n\nTelling your parents and letting them deal with it was the best course of action in this case.", "NTA. Your sister didn\u2019t give you or your parents the opportunity to explain their/your side of the story when she posted that crap online for the whole world to see, now did she?", "NTA. Your sister is 23 and has a roof over her head. Deal with it and grow up. If she wants to vent, fine, but at least do it anonymously.", "NTA", "You acted to protect your family's honor from public lies. Sometimes such direct action is necessary", "The thing is, usually i would say running and telling your parents on an adult sibling is probably not the way to go in most cases. \n\nHowever, the internet and the things that happen there very much impact life in the real world and the level of impact is only going to increase-as much as we all just assume everything said online is a lie, we also take it very seriously and act accordingly. \n\nEmployers, community leaders and members, friends and friends of friends; if youre using your real name then youre not only exposing yourself to scrutiny but also anyone known to you. This can impact your life and their lives in so many ways its kinda ridiculous. \n\nSo no, NTA. You were protecting yourself and your family from nonsense. Period.", "NTA If you're not afraid to name names online you better be able to own up to it in real life. I missed Evy's age at the beginning and assumed she was a young teenager. Then I checked the age again and was flabbergasted.\n\nThe saddest part of this story is how Evy has allowed her unrealistic perceptions of pursecition limit her to a small and petty world. If you're 23 years old complaining about only getting riding lessons your life is not fun or exciting. Her negativity does not allow to form real friendships or accomplish her dreams but she can't blame herself. You and your parents are her scapegoat.", "Ok but why does Evy act like that? It's easy to say she's a spoiled narc, but I wonder what's her side of the story.\n\nStill I don't agree with what she did, if she wanted to vent online she could at least do that anonymously. Even better, she should have confronted your parents.", "Mia is wrong.  NTA.  Sister had every opportunity to defend herself.  What she did was indefensible.", "NTA for doing that. It\u2019s a good thing that you instantly told your parents about that. Your parents have to know that, instantly. Evy is being a spoiled brat.", "NTA. I don't think anything you would have said to your sister would make her change. Your sister sounds a lot like a 'friend' I used to go to school with.\n\nFor example.. Me and my friends were planning a big event which would include everyone from school. My friend who set up the FB event page couldn't invite this girl for whatever reason so I messaged her and told her about the event (date, time, food etc) and to message me if she had any qs. \n\nTime goes by, it's about a week out from the event and I see on her FB she has put this massive speil up about how she is the only one being excluded from this event and how isolated she feels. There were so many comments 'oh, poor you, I'm so sorry' etc. I messaged her and called out her bullshit because she knew that I had told her about it and that she had my details if she had any questions. All she did was delete the post. She didn't own up to anything. Just 'sorry' and dirty delete.", "Evy's story may reflect some deeper issues she is facing. Perhaps the intervention of a psychologist is needed.", "Info: is there a possibility that your parents had to sometimes prioritise you due to your additional needs, which may have made Evy feel abandoned and unloved?", "This is complicated, can\u2019t pass judgement without hearing the other side of the story on this one. \n\nKinda disgusting that people on here have already passed an opinion slamming Evy, those same people would be agreeing with Evy had they come across her social media posts first and would call out OP and her parents for being narcs.", "NTA - obviously you\u2019re protecting your family but rather than your parents threaten to throw your sister out, it sounds like she needs serious therapy. This behaviour likely stems from trauma or some complex personality disorder. Might be a narc or a sociopath, they do stuff like this to get a rise out of people to \u201cfeel\u201d. She\u2019s probably dealing with a lot of self hate underneath the act of making everyone feel like shit all the time. But then, she would have to want the help too.", "NTA. Your sister is 23 and acting like a toddler.", "Mia's advice might usually be good, but she's way off this time. Definitely NTA, but your sister sounds like one. lol", "NTA.  I would have been more inclined to challenge the posts online though - Replying with comments such as \"That the event you specifically asked them not to attend because....\"  etc. (after having screenshotted the posts so that I could show my parents after I got booted off her friends list!)", "NTA\n\nYour sister was playing stupid games. Got her stupid prize.\n\nThe problem is, she was trashing both yours, and your parents reputations. Dont let anybody tell you that you were in the wrong for this. Crap like this can destroy peoples lives.", "She had the option to publicly admit to all her \"friends\" she was lying and she chose to delete it instead. I assume so she could keep going on some other platform with more \"proof\".\n\nDefinitely NTA, but really should have forced the public apology imo. Until you have proof there are no other accounts, I wouldn't say anything was even done here. What person on this planet only has one social media account?", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want your parents reading stuff, don\u2019t post it on a publicly-available forum using your real name. You owed no duty of confidentiality and she forfeited any right of response by airing it publicly. It happened to be you to alert your parents to it, but it could easily have been one of their friends or colleagues that saw it, or even found it by themselves - your parents are what, late-40s/early-50s? - it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for them or their friends to have a social media presence.\n\nThe reaction of your parents, just or unjust, is not relevant to the judgment of your actions. Your actions were reasonable and whatever your parents chose to do it on them (which I also think was reasonable, but that\u2019s a separate issue)", "Your parents read what she wrote.

As opposed to horsebelly riding or what? What a strange and unique turn of phrase", "The fun stops once you talk shit about someone using their real name or clearly identifying information. She's not a child anymore, so she should be able to deal with the consequences of her actions. NTA", "NTA, your sister might be a narcissist", "NTA - Evy brought this on herself. Mia is wrong on this account.", "Your feelings are completely understandable, especially when you witness your sister fabricate and distort the truth about your family.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a narcissist. You didn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d, you showed what she\u2019d been doing. Snitching isn\u2019t seen as something good by kids, but when someone is doing something hurtful (and this is hurtful to your and your parents reputation) it makes sense to make them stop. There\u2019s no \u201cher side her thing.\u201d There\u2019s reality and the lies she\u2019s deliberately spewed. There was nothing to clarify, and if you\u2019d confronted her yourself, she would have ignored you or retaliated.", "NTA", "What is there left to explain?

I did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA and if I was in your situation not only would have is shown mum and dad but I would have put her on blast !", "Well, if Evy still lives with her parents and you and posts lies, not even hiding your identity, you took the correct action. It wasn\u2019t a mistake on her part but had a nefarious purpose. NTA.", "NTA - She lied to garner sympathy online and slandered you and your parents in the process.

If everything you say is true, then what she did was slander your parents online, and they had every right to know that was happening.", "NTA. She's 23 years old and it's high time she's held accountable for her actions before she does this to other people not in the family and get sued for it.", "Maybe you should try talking to Evy before telling your parents. That can help minimize conflict and better understand her perspective", "ESH: \n\nEvy for obvious reasons of being a liar, and using private matters for SoMe clout.
