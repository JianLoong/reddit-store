He has three cousins, the two boys who are 23 & 20 are two of his groomsmen in the wedding. He is very close with them and always has been so it made sense he would have them in the wedding party. A few months ago my MIL asked me what the other cousin(15F), we\u2019ll call her Ally, was going to do for the wedding.\n\n I was confused by this and just asked her what she meant. And she said that EVERYONE felt that Ally needed a part in the wedding since her brothers have a part. I told her that she could stand at the front of the venue and welcome people as they walk in or be some sort of usher? She said \u201coh no Ally wouldn\u2019t want to do that\u201d and then insisted I put candles at the alter and Ally can walk down the aisle and light the candles\u2026 our alter is a massive pergola and to make it look nice it would have to be a LOT of candles as there is a bunch of space to fill. If there were candles we would need lanterns because the candles would immediately go out as the wedding is outdoors. I said no to that because it\u2019s more money for me to spend just to give a someone a job and personally I don\u2019t want candles and lanterns at the alter. \n\nShe then says that Ally wants to be a bridesmaid, I said no because I am not close with ally at all. She then said she could be a flower girl with our daughter (17mo) and she can walk our daughter down the aisle. I also said no to this because I already planned that my MOH (my sister) would walk with our daughter down the aisle, my sister is very special to me and my sister was so excited when I told her I wanted her to walk with my daughter. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking that away from my sister so I also said no to that. \n\nFast forward to yesterday and my fianc\u00e9 tells me that his family is upset with me for being so difficult and not giving Ally a place in the wedding. My overall view is that she\u2019s 15 and we aren\u2019t close with her, and I\u2019m not going to change anything I have already planned or buy more wedding stuff just for her to have a part\u2026. am I the asshole???\n\nEDIT: I want to add that Ally has said nothing to us herself.. we have only heard things through other people. I honestly don\u2019t even know if Ally has any idea that any of this has transpired. My fianc\u00e9 is going to reach out to her about being either an usher or standing at the front of the venue to greet people.
