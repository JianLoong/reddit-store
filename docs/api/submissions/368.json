I grew up with my father, and always craved my mother's attention but she was absorbed in her own life and family. We saw her some weekends, until we just stopped going when I was about 12.\n\nI've always wanted to get close to her. Recently I went through a hard time and lost almost everything I have. I re-kindled a relationship with her, and have been taking it slowly to try to have a healthy relationship this time.\n\nWhenever we message, she never asks much about me, and responds to my messages simply with updates on her own life. I told her I have booked to go to Canada, and am very excited to be getting away from the chaos that is my current situation.\n\nShe didn't ask any details about my planned holiday - who i'm going with, what i'm planning to do. Without missing a beat, she simply asked me to go to this specific shop for her and bring her back a souvenir she collects from those shops in various cities around the world. \n\nI was so upset. I agreed to go and collect the souvenir, then she said and actually will you get one for my friend too? I said yes. \n\nWhen i was there, i dedicated time to hunting down the shop. i was so angry, i just bought one for her rather than get her friend one too - i was annoyed enough about her sending me on this goose chase during the holiday i was treating myself to, and wasn't going to be taking something back for her friend too.\n\nWhen i gave it to her, she suggested that during my next holidays, i can go to the same shop and get her the souvenir from here too. I absolutely refused and it's caused a lot of tension between us - i don't want to spend my hard-earned holidays thinking... 'i must go and get this thing for my mother'. I want to go to parks, spend time in nature, and absorb the city opposed to having that slight stress in the back of my mind of 'i must bring this back'.

She sounds like a narcissist and no one needs people like that in their lives.  I feel like souvenir's are supposed to be something given to another person because they felt that it reminded them of the person and is a treat. It sounds like your mom just wanted you to buy her this specific thing because you were going to be in the area and she couldn't be bothered to look for it herself. If I were you, I'd be rethinking wanting to have a relationship with her. It doesn't sound like she wants one with you, sadly and that is something she is missing out on.", "It sounds like your craving for a relationship with your mom is blinding you a little, and keeping you from communicating boundaries and saying no to her. Don\u2019t agree to do things that further build resentment, and when it comes to texting let her be the first to reach out - and stick to that. If she only talks about herself, leave it on read. You are in control of the relationship that you have, and if she isn\u2019t offering anything positive to your life, it may be time to back away and save yourself the stress and heartache. I\u2019m wishing you luck!", "NTA. But I do wonder whether this uneven relationship is worth the time and energy. It feels to me like you want this much more than her.\n\n>Whenever we message, she never asks much about me\n\nShe clearly doesn't care all that much and you know this to be true. Does she message you at all or are you the one who initiates the messages? I had a friend whose company I really liked. Then one day I realised that I initiated all contact. So I stopped to see if he would ever intiate a message. Reader, he did not. I was pretty sad when I realised that he didn't value our friendship as much as I did but I decided to let it go. Maybe you should consider doing the same.", "NTA. \n\nBut why do that to yourself? She can ask but ultimately you agreed to do it, which turned out to be something you hated and upset you. I suggest you tell her no, that you don\u2019t have time. Or honestly, ignore the request.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I knew someone who collected the Starbucks city and country mugs. And would always tell me to get them one if I happened to be somewhere where they didn't have one from. I would say \"if I see one...\" but sometimes even if they were there, it wasn't convenient for me to carry it around all day, and I simply didn't bother. It wasn't a need, but a want, so I never felt bad fibbing that I hadn't seen any.", "Exactly!  I did the same thing with the Starbucks cups for my Aunt."]}
