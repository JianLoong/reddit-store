The last time I got pulled over for that, I owned it and got written a fix it ticket instead of the speeding ticket. I would never have done what she did. \n2) Sister would be the LAST person I would call if I had somehow gotten arrested.

If your sister in jail for a financial crime, she may no longer be eligible to deal with the estate.  In my state, you would be able to petition the court to be appointed executor and get the estate wrapped up.  I would consult your own attorney.  Banks will usually stall foreclosure proceedings when the homeowner has died because they have the ability to recoup through the probate proceedings, but not forever.  We've had the probate court appoint a bank rep. to finish the estate when relatives refuse to participate.", "My sister was the only one who ever had the notorized will, and she apparently lost it and cannot produce it. She also got caught in several lies she told the attorney, like that she had no way to contact me. When I told them that I have had the same cell number for more than 15 years, as well as Facebook and the same email for the same 15, they were quite floored that Sister contacting me was that easy all along. After asking me a ton of questions, and then answering mine about what the hell a bond waiver was, the attorney actually told me not to sign it, that they were now legally bound, since there was no physical will to indicate who gets what, to file probate as if no will ever existed. Meaning, the money from the sale of the house went into a probate escrow account and will be divided 50/50 between her and I. (Sister told them I had it. Nope. Haven't seen it since the night Mom died.)", "3 squares and a cot!", "Thank you so much. \ud83d\ude2d \nI try hard to be a good person, but I have my own demons and mental illness to battle, so sometimes I fail miserably. But I have always been there for my family through thick and thin, even if all I had the spoons for was to send memes or dog pics. And like, she's my SISTER. That seemed like the one person I shouldn't give up on. But she left me no choice I feel. I felt like I was chasing a dead woman. :(", "Thank you. I was trying to make sure what was in my head translated to text, but of course you are all lacking the sound of me sarcastically rolling my eyes hard enough to lift the ceiling while saying \"She could have just NOT done this.\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\ude77", "The Book Wyrm has spoken. I shall evict this ghost and try and get some sleep.", "Because there is no estate left other than the house, I decided to not pursue executorship. The attorney hired by the realtor said everything from that conversation on was pretty straightforward. Since Sister could not produce a will that had been signed and notorized, the attorney chose to proceed as if there had never been a will, because he said at this point, 5 years later, there essentially wasn't one regardless of what the survivors said. So he advised me to NOT sign the bond waiver allowing Sister to quick-sell the house and make off with the money, and instead added me to the list of inheritors, with an entitlement of 50% after the funds are released by probate court. I do instend to call him Monday and advise him of what has occured, but her crime isn't specifically financial like embezzlement or anything, so I doubt that she's now excluded. But I'm no lawyer, so I could be wrong.", "What an awful situation, I'm so sorry. She sounds toxic and unhealthy to have in your life. She's already burned through a good chunk of your inheritance so she doesn't deserve any more of your money. She's made her bed, you were completely reasonable by letting her lie in it.", "No need to thank me \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nYou should be proud of yourself for having the strength and courage to cope with everything life has thrown at you.\n\nLife definitely isn\u2019t fair but I like to think everything happens for a reason, even the worst times for me (e.g. getting Crohn\u2019s disease) have made me a better person and appreciate things in life more.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve been through and coming out the other side as well as being a person who goes out of their way for their family is admirable.", "My husband agrees. He has hated her since our mom got sick enough to require round the clock care. Because as soon as Sister found out there was so much money, she set herself up as caretaker and accountant, and portraying herself to the world as a suffering hero. But for the three years after Dad died, it was husband and myself taking days off work to take Mom to chemo, us at her house every weekend to help her with things, or just surround her with love so she didn't lose her mind missing Dad. Sister was rarely anywhere to be found. A lot of times, Mom would ask \"Have you talked to your sister? I haven't seen or heard from her in weeks.\" That kept breaking my heart over and over again and I woupd angrily text Sister \"Mom misses you, CALL HER\" I could have cared LESS about all the money, Mom was pretty generous with us while we were down there helping her and loving her. I just wanted my Mom to not being dying. \n\nSo when husband and best friend heard the news, they both were like \"You left her there right?\" I think bestie would have kicked my ass!", "It's taken me 5 years, some therapy, and the best husband and friends ever to get to the point of being able to acknowledge Sister and I are no longer family in any logical sense of that word. I have my own constructed family now, a host of sisters both IRL and on FB who are so much healthier for me.", "Lol that last bit made me smile. I'm really glad hubby and bestie have your back.
