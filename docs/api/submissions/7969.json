Harsh lesson for her to learn after she alienated anyone that might've been able to help.\n\nYou reap what you sow sister!", "NTA. Your sister has proved multiple times she does not view you as a family member and only sees you as a convenient link to access money. \n\nOnce the time to split the will in the family comes, people show their true colours. Think about it this way - if she shared that +200k, maybe there would have been money for you to spare. She made her own bed and now can lie in it.

If people keep bailing her out, she will never learn and will make the same mistakes over and over again.\n\nPerhaps there would be a bit more of a debate if you two had a better history between each other but I can\u2019t see any reason why after all the things she\u2019s done that she should expect you to help her.", "NTA\n\nYour sister essentially stole from you, and went against your mothers wishes. Screw her. Karma is a beautiful thing.", "NTA. Yeah, she\u2019s your sister, but by the way you described her and what she\u2019s done, she\u2019s only your sister by blood relation and not much else. She used your family members to get what she wants and she\u2019s doing the same now. If you bail her out this time, she\u2019ll\njust keep coming back for more of your time, your money, and stress you out.", "NTA. She burned that bridge. Sleep with a clear conscience.", "NTA.  You were being solicited by a third party. You had no direct evidence that, in fact, your sister was in jail. That's one thing that, most certainly, needed to be checked on before making any commitments. Also, you needed to look into what other obligations you might have been take on had you put up the bail money. You had no guarantee that your sister, or anyone else for that matter, would reimburse you for the costs of her bail. And finally, she should have her own assets that could be used for paying for her own bail.  You're under no obligation to assume these risks for someone with whom you've gone N/C and without any guarantees that the money would be returned.", "NTA. And, even if you bailed her out your sis would totally jump bail and then you would have to deal with all that drama.  It also sounds like your sis has a drug problem or some other addiction. She may have some other mental health disorder too. I guess if she ever truly wants to get help and get sober then you can help her do that but yeah, don't bail her out.

The original will, with a 40/40 split and a lesser amount to my daughter and aunt, is what Mom agreed to when she was still coherent. I was there, I witnessed her agreeing, video recorded it, and watched her scrawl a big X on it. The final will came as an absolute SHOCK to me. Sister pretended shock, but I later found out she was involved in the process of the \"new will\" being written.", "I guess that helps her out then, because I found out after the bail bond call that she's been on a Facebook alt account crying about being homeless since being kicked out of Mom's house after it sold.", "I honestly hope this is her rock bottom and she gets help.", "And this was LITERALLY an avoidable crime. Like, literally just do not do this, and police officers will not be arresting you.", "I mean, there is even MORE to our story, but that post would have been deleted for length. :( \nBut, long story short, we have a pretty chaotic and largely negative history, and about 2 years ago after all my texts and emails went ignored, I finally gave up and moved on with my own life.

I confirmed the arrest, the charges, basically everything the bail bonds place told me.", "Funny you say that, because the bail bonds place wanted me to confirm a stable address for Sister, said they couldn't post bond without it. I couldn't confirm anything other than a hotel. At that point the lady thanked me and said I was welcome to call again if I had questions. \n\nAnd yes... addiction plays a strong part in the story as of about 4 years ago. :(", "I had a conversation with myself about what I would do if I were in her position, wouldn't I want my sister to help me?\nBut then I realized two things:\n1) Being ADHD with a strong sense of right from wrong, I am generally a pretty law-abiding person, other than occasionally speeding. The last time I got pulled over for that, I owned it and got written a fix it ticket instead of the speeding ticket. I would never have done what she did. \n2) Sister would be the LAST person I would call if I had somehow gotten arrested. I have any number of good people I could count on in a crisis that I would call before her. I haven't burned any of my bridges, I worked to hard building them with these wonderful people.\n\nSo yeah... she is alone because she made herself alone.", "I didn't mean like, couldn't do it as in she's innocent. I mean that my high IQ sister with dual Master's degrees could have just... NOT done what she f**king did. I have her arrest record.

It wasn't her fault, she just had a job to do. I was just so startled that this conversation was even happening, that fight-or-flight steered me towards being a little fighty and bitey. I should call their office tomorrow and apologize.", "The money from the house is trapped in probate, and because she lost the will, she only gets half now. As for the 200k, it's long gone. LONG gone.", "I really hope this jolts her into getting the help she needs and getting her life back on track. I just cannot be any part of it any more.

It says a lot about the good person you are though that you still wanted to connect with her even after everything she\u2019s done.\n\nIf after such a long and chaotic history together and the fact that she made no attempt to contact you for two years despite you trying, you can be certain that if she were to just suddenly reach out and try to connect with you, her intentions would NOT be good.\n\nI wish you all the good fortune life can you give you.", "If that's so, then he's my kinda people!   \n\n\nIn all seriousness though, I hope your sister honors your NC with her. She's done enough damage.", "Ahh my bad, sarcasm can be troublesome in text form. \nThank you for the clarification. Doesn't change the verdict though NTA", "Mentally evict her. She found that her actions have consequences. NTA", "Exactly. :)", "As someone who works for a estate planning and probate attorney, I do so love it when a bad deed like this gets hard karma'd.\n\nI'm sorry that you're dealing with this.  If your sister in jail for a financial crime, she may no longer be eligible to deal with the estate.  In my state, you would be able to petition the court to be appointed executor and get the estate wrapped up.  I would consult your own attorney.  Banks will usually stall foreclosure proceedings when the homeowner has died because they have the ability to recoup through the probate proceedings, but not forever.  We've had the probate court appoint a bank rep. to finish the estate when relatives refuse to participate.", "My sister was the only one who ever had the notorized will, and she apparently lost it and cannot produce it. She also got caught in several lies she told the attorney, like that she had no way to contact me. When I told them that I have had the same cell number for more than 15 years, as well as Facebook and the same email for the same 15, they were quite floored that Sister contacting me was that easy all along. After asking me a ton of questions, and then answering mine about what the hell a bond waiver was, the attorney actually told me not to sign it, that they were now legally bound, since there was no physical will to indicate who gets what, to file probate as if no will ever existed. Meaning, the money from the sale of the house went into a probate escrow account and will be divided 50/50 between her and I. (Sister told them I had it. Nope. Haven't seen it since the night Mom died.)", "3 squares and a cot!", "Thank you so much. \ud83d\ude2d \nI try hard to be a good person, but I have my own demons and mental illness to battle, so sometimes I fail miserably. But I have always been there for my family through thick and thin, even if all I had the spoons for was to send memes or dog pics. And like, she's my SISTER. That seemed like the one person I shouldn't give up on. But she left me no choice I feel. I felt like I was chasing a dead woman. :(", "Thank you. I was trying to make sure what was in my head translated to text, but of course you are all lacking the sound of me sarcastically rolling my eyes hard enough to lift the ceiling while saying \"She could have just NOT done this.\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\ude77", "The Book Wyrm has spoken. I shall evict this ghost and try and get some sleep.", "Because there is no estate left other than the house, I decided to not pursue executorship. The attorney hired by the realtor said everything from that conversation on was pretty straightforward. Since Sister could not produce a will that had been signed and notorized, the attorney chose to proceed as if there had never been a will, because he said at this point, 5 years later, there essentially wasn't one regardless of what the survivors said. So he advised me to NOT sign the bond waiver allowing Sister to quick-sell the house and make off with the money, and instead added me to the list of inheritors, with an entitlement of 50% after the funds are released by probate court. I do instend to call him Monday and advise him of what has occured, but her crime isn't specifically financial like embezzlement or anything, so I doubt that she's now excluded. But I'm no lawyer, so I could be wrong.", "What an awful situation, I'm so sorry. She sounds toxic and unhealthy to have in your life. She's already burned through a good chunk of your inheritance so she doesn't deserve any more of your money. She's made her bed, you were completely reasonable by letting her lie in it.", "No need to thank me \ud83d\ude0a. \n\nYou should be proud of yourself for having the strength and courage to cope with everything life has thrown at you.\n\nLife definitely isn\u2019t fair but I like to think everything happens for a reason, even the worst times for me (e.g. getting Crohn\u2019s disease) have made me a better person and appreciate things in life more.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve been through and coming out the other side as well as being a person who goes out of their way for their family is admirable.", "My husband agrees. He has hated her since our mom got sick enough to require round the clock care. Because as soon as Sister found out there was so much money, she set herself up as caretaker and accountant, and portraying herself to the world as a suffering hero. But for the three years after Dad died, it was husband and myself taking days off work to take Mom to chemo, us at her house every weekend to help her with things, or just surround her with love so she didn't lose her mind missing Dad. Sister was rarely anywhere to be found. A lot of times, Mom would ask \"Have you talked to your sister? I haven't seen or heard from her in weeks.\" That kept breaking my heart over and over again and I woupd angrily text Sister \"Mom misses you, CALL HER\" I could have cared LESS about all the money, Mom was pretty generous with us while we were down there helping her and loving her. I just wanted my Mom to not being dying. \n\nSo when husband and best friend heard the news, they both were like \"You left her there right?\" I think bestie would have kicked my ass!", "It's taken me 5 years, some therapy, and the best husband and friends ever to get to the point of being able to acknowledge Sister and I are no longer family in any logical sense of that word. I have my own constructed family now, a host of sisters both IRL and on FB who are so much healthier for me.", "Lol that last bit made me smile. I'm really glad hubby and bestie have your back. Don't feel guilty for even a second, she'll have plenty of time to think about what she's done in there and you'll get a holiday from her shenanigans"]}
