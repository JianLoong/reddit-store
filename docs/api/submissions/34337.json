{"id": 34337, "submission_id": "18ymogk", "title": "AITA for refusing to send the kids to bed early just because my husband wants to relax?", "selftext": "My husband works 10hr shifts at a shipyard. Leaves at 8am and is home by 6:30pm. His job is 3 minutes down the street. I work 8hr shifts at home, while also homeschooling our 3 school aged kids (7yo twins, 5yo), nursing our 2 month old and doing all the cooking. We do NOT homeschool as a normal. Schools have been shut down for 5 or 6 weeks after finding lead in the drinking water. But given this, I'm doing far more than my husband is. Not that it's a competition but let's be real.\n\nWell, this past week has been extremely rough on me mentally. There was a child death in my family and another family member is hospitalized in ICU. I'm struggling to power through it while still working, homeschooling, nursing the baby and cooking by myself. My husband is the opposite though. He isn't even remotely affected by what's going on in my family right now (he didn't know the child and he's not close to my hospitalized family member). He checks in on me through text during the day but when he gets home, he doesn't mention it. Doesn't ask how I am. He grabs his plate of dinner and takes the baby to go hang out with him while I clean up (I know it could be argued that he should be helping clean but me and my children are clean freaks and enjoy cleaning so it's no issue).\n\nBut the night before last he asked if I could send the kids to bed early (7pm) because he \"just wanted to relax\". I said no. The kids had been great all day and they weren't even bothering him so no. They won't be punished for zero reason. Then last night at like 6:50ish he goes \"so we are sending the kids to bed at 7, right?\" I said no, why would we? And he snapped. He said \"I just want to fucking relax without having anyone talk to me after busting my ass all day. I'm tired of working and getting zero down time.\" And storms out of the room. This absolutely pissed me off because I work full time and do everything in this house so I should be the one begging for a break. The kids are in bed by 8, meaning he has literally 2.5 hours to deal with them daily. But anyways, he comes back in and says \"sorry, can we please just send them to bed?\" I said no and walked away. He's pissed at me and says I'm not letting him catch a break \"once a week\".\n\nETA: we have an agreement that neither of us make a decision regarding the kids without first speaking to each other. This was put in place after he repeatedly made new rules without informing me and would discipline the kids for not following the rules when I was the one allowing it because nothing was ever communicated to me. He also overstepped tremendously back some years ago. So we now have this agreement. And no, he doesn't want them to go to bed early to have time with me. He wants to sit at his computer with headphones in and not be interrupted.", "created_utc": 1704399225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ymogk/aita_for_refusing_to_send_the_kids_to_bed_early/", "score": 1919, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which means not only is he not contributing his fair share, but he doesn\u2019t even adequately appreciate her for doing everything he dumps on her.  Because how can you appreciate, much less actually *show* appreciation (heavens!), for what you don\u2019t even care enough to notice?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not suggesting you just jump to divorce, but jeez, what exactly about your life would really change all that much if you did?  Think that through as a thought exercise.  \n\nLike he wouldn\u2019t be there to help parent\u2026but does he really do all that much parenting now, or does he just kinda live in the same house as them?  I mean, wouldn\u2019t the kids actually get *more* actual quality time with him if you divorced because he\u2019d have no choice but to focus on them during his custody/visitation time?\n\nAnd you\u2019d have one less pair of hands to cook and clean and do all the mental load management.  But\u2026he\u2019s not really doing any of that now.  In fact, your load would actually get lighter because you\u2019d have one less person making messes, creating laundry, demanding dinner, etc.\n\nAnd you may love him a lot, but nothing kills love faster than festering resentment.  Like the kind that comes from having appalling conversations where you have to identify and defend the things that are obviously in your children\u2019s best interests *from their own father*.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to work on things with him because you think he can change, ok.  But if you\u2019re just sticking around because you\u2019re worried that being divorced would make things worse/harder\u2026I don\u2019t know that it would be.  I mean, it would different, for sure.

He\u2019s an equal parent, so you two should be coming to some sort of agreement rather than you dictating the decision.

Leaves at 8am and is home by 6:30pm. His job is 3 minutes down the street. I work 8hr shifts at home, while also homeschooling our 3 school aged kids (7yo twins, 5yo), nursing our 2 month old and doing all the cooking. We do NOT homeschool as a normal. Schools have been shut down for 5 or 6 weeks after finding lead in the drinking water. But given this, I'm doing far more than my husband is. Not that it's a competition but let's be real. \n\nWell, this past week has been extremely rough on me mentally. There was a child death in my family and another family member is hospitalized in ICU. I'm struggling to power through it while still working, homeschooling, nursing the baby and cooking by myself. My husband is the opposite though. He isn't even remotely affected by what's going on in my family right now (he didn't know the child and he's not close to my hospitalized family member). He checks in on me through text during the day but when he gets home, he doesn't mention it. Doesn't ask how I am. He grabs his plate of dinner and takes the baby to go hang out with him while I clean up (I know it could be argued that he should be helping clean but me and my children are clean freaks and enjoy cleaning so it's no issue). \n\nBut the night before last he asked if I could send the kids to bed early (7pm) because he \"just wanted to relax\". I said no. The kids had been great all day and they weren't even bothering him so no. They won't be punished for zero reason. Then last night at like 6:50ish he goes \"so we are sending the kids to bed at 7, right?\" I said no, why would we? And he snapped. He said \"I just want to fucking relax without having anyone talk to me after busting my ass all day. I'm tired of working and getting zero down time.\" And storms out of the room. This absolutely pissed me off because I work full time and do everything in this house so I should be the one begging for a break. The kids are in bed by 8, meaning he has literally 2.5 hours to deal with them daily. But anyways, he comes back in and says \"sorry, can we please just send them to bed?\" I said no and walked away. He's pissed at me and says I'm not letting him catch a break \"once a week\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

On our last pregnancy 2 years ago, I was looking to just cuddle and spend some time with her, she focused big time on the twins, and I was helping with everything manage finances, manage the house needs, house cleanup hired a maid, work 2 jobs, and her needs. This led me to burnout, and I did seek connection with her, but she was unavailable emotionally. I detached emotionally briefly as a response to her behavior of not wanting to spend time with me but always with our children and when she realized that I was detached emotionally she decided to seek attention elsewhere. All of this lead to her cheating and me finding out this June, then filing for divorce this August with a high chance of me having full custody of our 5 babies.\n\nPlease communicate between each other's before even reaching out to people in the internet for advise.

I mean, it's not hard to hold and entertain an 8 week old or mothers in law all over the world wouldn't think it's their \"right\" to just sit down and claim somebody else's kid like some of them do, but if that's where he's comfortable starting to 'parent' at least there's a toe hold for the conversation.

You need to be safe to take care of your kids, and if you keep going like this, exhaustion and mental health struggles are the tip of the iceberg for what can go sideways.

Only bringing in some income (he can\u2019t afford to support the whole family as OP also works full time) and that\u2019s it is ridiculous \u201cto bring to the table\u201d when you have four kids and a household AND a wife going thru an extremely hard time with deaths and another possible death in the family.", "You sound like you're at least honest with yourself about it, that's important!", "Knowing your own limits is an invaluable skill", "Good for you for having that kind of self-awareness. I absolutely respect and appreciate that. Life would be so much easier if we could all understand ourselves that well. Much love.", "It's totally fair to be honest about your needs and limits.", "Same here! I won't even get a dog, no matter how much I love them. I can't deal with anything that requires my full attention and care full time. Just had my mom visit me for 2 weeks and I have never felt so drained in my life, and that's with a grown ass woman who raised me \ud83d\ude05 My mom now understand why I say I am not built to be responsible for any other living being. \n\nThing is, I had a dad similar to OP's husband. My mom raised us pretty much on her own even though they didn't split until I was 11 (and I'm the youngest). I know I'll never be able to give from myself like she did, and I'll never put a child through the shit my dad put me through. OP is absolutely NTA, and I salute women like her and my mom who put their kids first.", "His job is only 3 minutes away", "I think this may be the difference between screens, watching a movie and playing on a tablet are very different. \n\nI am not sure where my daughters binge watching disney+ on her tablet falls.", "redditors are a different breed \ud83d\udc80", "When one person doesn't talk to another, it's not a \"lack of communication\" that the other can solve.", "How dare you have a nuanced view of a complicated situation", "Husband is absolutely not pulling his fair share. But that is a long long way from \u201cwhat is he bringing to the table\u201d. This is without us even knowing the real income split.", "I have one needy cat and he really is all I can handle right now. I have depression and often struggle to properly take care of myself, there\u2019s no way I could handle a child. I\u2019m single because the thought of dating and spending so much time with another person is exhausting. \n\nAnd idk what your mom or your relationship with her is like, but it\u2019s draining to host my mom for even a couple of days. Two weeks would be impossible. Major respect!", "[deleted]", "Good for you", "And some, like OP's husband, shouldn't breed at all. If you're siding with him...\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "True. Better to just express a need and get shot down with no other alternative, right?", "The outrage.", "I guess\u2026 but I doubt it\u2019s that much income if his wife who has four kids didn\u2019t even get to take a month off after giving birth and works full time, not part time.", "im not siding with anyone. its the fact that you think those children are better off with split parents rather than having a parent that asked for  them to sleep an hour early after a back breaking 10hr shift thats wild.", "...what need? We're talking about rules he arbitrarily decided for their children, didn't tell their mother about, and then punished them for. He doesn't NEED to do that.", "I am passing judgement based on her description of the situation, not on my perception of her tone. You\u2019re reaching.", "Typical Reddit in action. Willing to bet none of these people are married, have kids, understand relationship dynamics, or have spent any time in therapy.", "That argument doesnt make sense. If her job offered 3 months of paid maternity leave why wouldnt she take it. She back to work because her job most likely did not offer extended leave", "The one where he asked for the kids to go to bed early one night for his mental health because he works an incredibly physically demanding job. That need that was ignored. \n\nAnd don\u2019t try to say anything about \u201cpunishing\u201d the kids. One night of relaxing in their room early is not going to scar them. \n\nEveryone would be SCREAMING a dad made a decision and told the mom \u201cno\u201d when she was \u201cexpressing a need\u201d.", "Honestly it feels like most would rather fight and be right and \u201cwin\u201d for themselves. When only one spouse wins the marriage loses which is what this post sounds like\u20142 people trying to win for themselves.\n\nDoes it suck sometimes to be the bigger person even when you think you\u2019re the one in the right? Yes. But something tells me it\u2019d suck worse to have this be a hill to die on and ruin a marriage and be a single mom of 4 kids, one being a new born.", "Many jobs don\u2019t in the us\u2026 but husbands who can comfortably support their family can allow their wife to take unpaid time off, or even quit their jobs while they recover\u2026 but he obviously doesn\u2019t so she can\u2019t. Which is my whole point. \n\nAny husband who expects his wife to birth and fully care for FOUR of his children honestly should be supporting the entire family so she doesn\u2019t have to work at all anyways.", "He does not NEED them to go to bed so he can play video games. He can go to his room. There are five other people in the house. They don't need to be banished from common spaces so he can relax. That's selfish.\n\nIt is punishing small children when that's not their routine. They're not going to relax. They're going to be wound up about the change. If they did sleep, they would wake up an hour earlier the next day and wreck their schedules. She doesn't NEED that when she's working 2 full-time jobs at once."]}
