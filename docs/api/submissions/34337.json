{"id": 34337, "submission_id": "18ymogk", "title": "AITA for refusing to send the kids to bed early just because my husband wants to relax?", "selftext": "My husband works 10hr shifts at a shipyard. Leaves at 8am and is home by 6:30pm. His job is 3 minutes down the street. I work 8hr shifts at home, while also homeschooling our 3 school aged kids (7yo twins, 5yo), nursing our 2 month old and doing all the cooking. We do NOT homeschool as a normal. Schools have been shut down for 5 or 6 weeks after finding lead in the drinking water. But given this, I'm doing far more than my husband is. Not that it's a competition but let's be real.\n\nWell, this past week has been extremely rough on me mentally. There was a child death in my family and another family member is hospitalized in ICU. I'm struggling to power through it while still working, homeschooling, nursing the baby and cooking by myself. My husband is the opposite though. He isn't even remotely affected by what's going on in my family right now (he didn't know the child and he's not close to my hospitalized family member). He checks in on me through text during the day but when he gets home, he doesn't mention it. Doesn't ask how I am. He grabs his plate of dinner and takes the baby to go hang out with him while I clean up (I know it could be argued that he should be helping clean but me and my children are clean freaks and enjoy cleaning so it's no issue).\n\nBut the night before last he asked if I could send the kids to bed early (7pm) because he \"just wanted to relax\". I said no. The kids had been great all day and they weren't even bothering him so no. They won't be punished for zero reason. Then last night at like 6:50ish he goes \"so we are sending the kids to bed at 7, right?\" I said no, why would we? And he snapped. He said \"I just want to fucking relax without having anyone talk to me after busting my ass all day. I'm tired of working and getting zero down time.\" And storms out of the room. This absolutely pissed me off because I work full time and do everything in this house so I should be the one begging for a break. The kids are in bed by 8, meaning he has literally 2.5 hours to deal with them daily. But anyways, he comes back in and says \"sorry, can we please just send them to bed?\" I said no and walked away. He's pissed at me and says I'm not letting him catch a break \"once a week\".\n\nETA: we have an agreement that neither of us make a decision regarding the kids without first speaking to each other. This was put in place after he repeatedly made new rules without informing me and would discipline the kids for not following the rules when I was the one allowing it because nothing was ever communicated to me. He also overstepped tremendously back some years ago. So we now have this agreement. And no, he doesn't want them to go to bed early to have time with me. He wants to sit at his computer with headphones in and not be interrupted.", "created_utc": 1704399225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ymogk/aita_for_refusing_to_send_the_kids_to_bed_early/", "score": 974, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I'm not going to say that your husband's feelings and needs are invalid, but rather that it's unfair that he only acknowledges his own.\n\nYou guys need to find a time where you're at your least exhausted to discuss, ideally in couples therapy.\n\nYour husband is your life companion; who else would you turn to when going through something so hard?\n\nI'm sorry for your family's loss.", "Your poor children will grow up feeling unwanted", "He sucks, but you're letting him be useless.

Yay, yet another \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cspouse\u201d who believes their responsibility to both are fully discharged simply by having a job and by watching their own kid for a few minutes every once and awhile.  And in his case, it looks like he only does the latter in order to escape from cleaning. \n\nAnd everything else (the fact that his spouse *also* works *while* is postpartum *and* is doing all the temp homeschool, and that she\u2019s doing pretty much all the actual parenting, cooking, cleaning, mental load mgmt, etc., too) is not even on his radar.  Which means not only is he not contributing his fair share, but he doesn\u2019t even adequately appreciate her for doing everything he dumps on her.  Because how can you appreciate, much less actually *show* appreciation (heavens!), for what you don\u2019t even care enough to notice?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not suggesting you just jump to divorce, but jeez, what exactly about your life would really change all that much if you did?  Think that through as a thought exercise.  \n\nLike he wouldn\u2019t be there to help parent\u2026but does he really do all that much parenting now, or does he just kinda live in the same house as them?  I mean, wouldn\u2019t the kids actually get *more* actual quality time with him if you divorced because he\u2019d have no choice but to focus on them during his custody/visitation time?\n\nAnd you\u2019d have one less pair of hands to cook and clean and do all the mental load management.  But\u2026he\u2019s not really doing any of that now.  In fact, your load would actually get lighter because you\u2019d have one less person making messes, creating laundry, demanding dinner, etc.\n\nAnd you may love him a lot, but nothing kills love faster than festering resentment.  Like the kind that comes from having appalling conversations where you have to identify and defend the things that are obviously in your children\u2019s best interests *from their own father*.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to work on things with him because you think he can change, ok.  But if you\u2019re just sticking around because you\u2019re worried that being divorced would make things worse/harder\u2026I don\u2019t know that it would be.  I mean, it would different, for sure.  Change is never simple.  But my point is that I wouldn\u2019t let fear of divorce stop you from having some really frank discussions and setting *much* higher expectations.", "NTA.

Of course, as people have pointed out, he chose to have kids and now it\u2019s his responsibility to parent him. But those things can co-exist. It does sound like you may be going through more, but you said yourself you don\u2019t need a break. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong for him to need a break even if he has \u201cless\u201d on his plate. It sounds like you aren\u2019t really willing to compromise by simply saying \u201cno\u201d (although I understand not wanting to send the kids to bed early since they may see it as a a punishment or it may throw off their routine). He\u2019s an equal parent, so you two should be coming to some sort of agreement rather than you dictating the decision. Once a week, can the kids independently watch a movie (I.e., quiet time until bed time)? Can you afford a sitter once a week for a couple of hours?

Leaves at 8am and is home by 6:30pm. His job is 3 minutes down the street. I work 8hr shifts at home, while also homeschooling our 3 school aged kids (7yo twins, 5yo), nursing our 2 month old and doing all the cooking. We do NOT homeschool as a normal. Schools have been shut down for 5 or 6 weeks after finding lead in the drinking water. But given this, I'm doing far more than my husband is. Not that it's a competition but let's be real. \n\nWell, this past week has been extremely rough on me mentally. There was a child death in my family and another family member is hospitalized in ICU. I'm struggling to power through it while still working, homeschooling, nursing the baby and cooking by myself. My husband is the opposite though. He isn't even remotely affected by what's going on in my family right now (he didn't know the child and he's not close to my hospitalized family member). He checks in on me through text during the day but when he gets home, he doesn't mention it. Doesn't ask how I am. He grabs his plate of dinner and takes the baby to go hang out with him while I clean up (I know it could be argued that he should be helping clean but me and my children are clean freaks and enjoy cleaning so it's no issue). \n\nBut the night before last he asked if I could send the kids to bed early (7pm) because he \"just wanted to relax\". I said no. The kids had been great all day and they weren't even bothering him so no. They won't be punished for zero reason. Then last night at like 6:50ish he goes \"so we are sending the kids to bed at 7, right?\" I said no, why would we? And he snapped. He said \"I just want to fucking relax without having anyone talk to me after busting my ass all day. I'm tired of working and getting zero down time.\" And storms out of the room. This absolutely pissed me off because I work full time and do everything in this house so I should be the one begging for a break. The kids are in bed by 8, meaning he has literally 2.5 hours to deal with them daily. But anyways, he comes back in and says \"sorry, can we please just send them to bed?\" I said no and walked away. He's pissed at me and says I'm not letting him catch a break \"once a week\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This led me to burnout, and I did seek connection with her, but she was unavailable emotionally. I detached emotionally briefly as a response to her behavior of not wanting to spend time with me but always with our children and when she realized that I was detached emotionally she decided to seek attention elsewhere. All of this lead to her cheating and me finding out this June, then filing for divorce this August with a high chance of me having full custody of our 5 babies.\n\nPlease communicate between each other's before even reaching out to people in the internet for advise.

He doesn't get to bitch about his kids existing, taking care of them is his job *equally* as much as it his wife's job.", "Op is also providing for the family. The dad doesn't even parent.", "> Homeschooling \u2026 based on her own choices\n\nDid you read the post? Authorities found lead in the school drinking water.", "Thankfully, not all dads pull this stuff. My SiL is a SAHM. My brother works long hours. It doesn't stop him from parenting when he gets home. \n\nLoL though his communication skills are lacking at times, when he's exhausted. But he at least steps up.", "This is a lazy ass take. Did you even read what OP wrote, friend?", "From someone who frequently got the \u201cyou don\u2019t have to sleep but you have to be quietly in your room\u201d because other people either wanted to relax or argue in the main rooms of the home it always felt like I was being punished for existing.   It seems so simple to just say It\u2019s not a punishment but when its happening during an age in your life where being sent to your room or sent to bed early are the go to punishments it can be hard not to interpret it as either being punished just for existing or as your parent telling you that you are an annoying inconvenience in their life.    I\u2019m sure for some kids it is fine but for others it will be really hard to detangle this instance of being sent to hang out in their room from every incident where it happened as a direct response to them doing something bad.", "It sounds like OP's not entirely sure that would be safe.", "I wouldn't leave those poor kids alone with him at all. He'd probably be such a jerk to them it would be really sad for them.", "Yes, but also I'm not sure how leaving  8am and getting home 10.5 hours later equals a 10 hour shift. Is he doing a 15 minute commute and no lunch?", "Yeah idk about you but I\u2019d much rather just work a labor intensive 10 hour job than be a full time (single) parent (bc that\u2019s what OP basically is) to 4 kids while also working a full time job. Also you obviously have no idea what it\u2019s like to carry a baby and birth it (hint - it\u2019s not easy, very \u201clabor\u201d intensive, no pun intended). \n\nYou\u2019re a loser for these replies and I truly hope you never put a woman thru pregnancy and childbirth just to be stuck tied to your ass for 18 years.", "Can but doesn\u2019t always. I\u2019ve never really noticed it impacting my kids. They go to sleep in about the same amount of time whether we have screens off for hours or we finish a movie right before bed.", "And here I am not managing to keep up with house chores with a 9-5:30 job and one child in daycare... how does she do it!", "Right, which is why I said I think they both suck because there is a lack of communication.", "Be appalled, it\u2019s completely obvious that she has had more than enough people validating her feelings in the comments. I said I was offering a *different perspective* of how her husband could be feeling.\n\nYes, he should be stepping up, that\u2019s why I said he sucks, too. \n\nI also didn\u2019t say that communication relies only on her, they BOTH should be communicating with each other. \n\nAlso, how is he supposed to just \u201ctake the kids\u201d when they have to jointly agree on things\u2014he\u2019s not allowed to parent the kids without her agreement which means, unfortunately, she is in a position to always be involved and never get a break. \n\nShe also wants to be the one to clean because they are clean freaks which probably means she prefers to do it herself so she knows it\u2019s up to her standards (speaking from someone who has a spouse like this).\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that SOME of OPs problems are self-created because there is an underlying controlling tone in her post which basically has her winning the \u201cwho is doing more\u201d competiton that she supposedly isn\u2019t trying to have.\n\nSo yes, I think they both need to communicate more and remember why they got married in the first place and work on being a better TEAM rather than seeming to actively work against each other. Once they do that it\u2019s so much easier to want to pick up your partners slack\u2026which is another reason why the husband sucks for not recognizing that need in OP. \n\nIt\u2019s okay that both of them share fault and have work to do to be better to each other and for each other.", "Except she is for all the reason I said", "It is, but you can\u2019t ignore the fact of how stressful manual labor is. They both deserve a break.", "Kind of sounds like she doesn\u2019t allow him to parent.", "Because he\u2019s working to pay the bills. You act like it\u2019s regular to break your back at a very physically demanding job for 10 hours a day and be able to do much else.", "I didn\u2019t realize that homeschooling was the only option. Typically accommodations in other districts would be made.", "You wouldn't last 30 minutes in OP's husband's job. But, I bet your only fans account covers your mortgage pretty well .", "I don't have a full time job other than my kids. I stay home with the 3 of them and even then its not easy. My husband works 12 hours a day but he still helps when he gets home. If you wanna be away from your kids that much every day then why do you have kids?", "Yea, I think it just depends on the kid.  My parents used to watch Muppets with me before bed and it put me right to sleep.", "My kids love reading it's kinda crazy my 10 yr old demands an hour and half of reading time before bed. And we've still caught her reading by flashlight.  It started with 15 minutes and just kept getting extended.", "i used to only sleep with my TV on as a kid, it helped me sleep bc i hated the silence. i still do sometimes, i\u2019ll turn the volume down low and just pass right on out lmao", "I can't keep up with my room with study and 1 (soon maybe 2) parttime jobs and no kids so good going!", "I'm the only dumbass child I take care of and my house is STILL a mess. It's endlessly frustrating and also I have no one else who I can blame my problems on.\n\nCan't wait until the sun comes back in the evenings to give me some energy after work.", "I am appalled. You have determined that this woman sucks based on your perception of her tone in a Reddit post, and some truly wild interpretation of their agreement that neither of them deviate from existing joint decisions and rules regarding their children without talking to each other. Saying he can\u2019t possibly watch his own children based on that is weaponised incompetence at its peak, I\u2019m actually impressed.\n\nThe devil doesn\u2019t need an advocate, and this husband doesn\u2019t need you to defend him. People are validating this woman because her partner is failing her. You don\u2019t need to put her down to restore some kind of internet balance. \n\nWhat is she supposed to communicate to him? What is there to tell him that he can\u2019t see with his own two eyes, but is ignoring in favour of his computer?", "Sure they do, they should hire a sitter for a day or two, have the kids stay with a relative, or arrange for a part time nanny. Not shut the kids away in their rooms as if they're unwanted and a problem. His solution lacks empathy, insight and care.", "Haven\u2019t you also passed judgement on the husband based on OPs perception of what is happening? Come on now, goes both ways."]}
