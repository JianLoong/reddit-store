You're 25. An adult. What you do with your apartment is no business of your parents.

Your sister has to deal with the fact that her parents don\u2019t accept who she is, that\u2019s really rough and it\u2019s probably going to be difficult for a really long time. By offering your apartment you\u2019d not only be giving your sister the opportunity to hang out with her girlfriend, you\u2019d also show your sister very decisively that she has someone in her corner and that\u2019s probably going to mean the world to her at this point", "YWBA\nYou would be awesome.

But your place your rules <3 Thank you for being a great human!", "NTA. Lying to homophobes to protect a queer child is always morally correct. You rock.", "NTA. You would not be the asshole if you did this, you would be a very kind and supportive sister. \n\nYou are trying to help your sister and her girlfriend have a normal and healthy relationship, which they deserve. You are not lying to your parents for a malicious or selfish reason, you are lying to protect your sister from their homophobia and intolerance. \n\nYou are not going against what they want because what they want is wrong and harmful. \n\nThey want to deny your sister her happiness and identity, which is not something you should respect or obey. You are doing the right thing by standing up for your sister and giving her a safe and comfortable place for her date nights.", "NTA.  You are a top sister.", "NTA\nWell done for being such a supportive big sister. The thought an offer alone will mean so much to your sister. Glad you have her back", "You would be purposely be deceiving your parents. Hope you are good with losing your relationship with them. They will never trust you again.", "NTA in terms of doing something very nice for your sister.\n\nBut if you live in a very bigoted, homophobic state/country/wherever, please figure out if you could be held criminally liable for contributing to the delinquency of a minor should either set of parents find out and come after you. \n\nIf not, lovely idea.  Given the choice between your sister and your parents, pick you sister every single time.", "You're NTA for offering but are you in a position to support yourself and two 16yo after they get kicked out for going against both their parents rules?", "NTA\n\nThat would be nice of you", "NTA but you might wanna phrase it as Eva having that space on that night as a general offer so she doesn't feel like she HAS to use it for a date night or even has to continue dating Lucy. She may need some mental and emotional space to herself too, espec to distance herself from your homophobic parents", "YWBTAlly", "NTA. You're a great big sister for coming up with the idea. Apparently your parents and Lucy's parents have decided to forget the unconditional part of paternal love and are being complete a-holes about it. \n\nI know it's never easy for anyone to come out to their family, especially so if it happens due to \"getting caught in the act\" rather than on their own terms, so showing your sister that you're there for her and that she can actually trust in you, is something truly heartwarming. This will strengthen your bonds and make your little sister's life easier and probably a lot happier as well. \n\nI've had my own little sister come out to me a few years back, when she was about 25 years old. She's never been shy about saying what's on her mind, but that day she acted completely out of character. She lives on the other side of the country, so we were communicating via text, so when she told me she had something to tell me, I could immediately guess what she was about to tell me. I made sure to be as loving and supportive as any big brother could, and made sure she knew that I loved her no matter what. \n\nA few months later, my daughter (who lives with her mother a few hours drive from here) texted me the exact same line: \"hey, I've got something I need to tell you\". Well, she also knows that she's loved & that said love would never change for any reason. \n\nA parents job is to love and support their children. As long as your child isn't out there hurting others or breaking the law, you're supposed to be by their side no matter what. \n\nSometimes that \"burden\" (it's never a burden, but some parents seem to think it is) falls on siblings. You're being a great example, a great sibling and overall a great human being for being there for your sister. \n\nIf your parents find out somehow & blow up at you, tell them some random dude from Finland told them to f*** off and to get over themselves and their bs and actually think about their daughter and her happiness for once.", "NTA. Eva is lucky to have such a great big sister to watch her back.", "NTA, thank you for supporting them :)", "YTA.  It's a nice gesture & I know you mean well, but you'd be lying to a lot of people.  Lies catch up with people.  It's only a matter of time before it will blow up in your face.", "NTA but you also shouldn\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t know which if any laws would apply here but if there\u2019s even a small chance Lucy\u2019s parents could react poorly to this your involvement letting a minor lie and stay at your place wouldn\u2019t look so good.", "NTA But there's one thing to consider. usually teenagers don't have a space without any supervision/damper  (parents can walk into a room, or in public you can't really go all the way) except for the occasional night when one of the parties parents are gone for the night/weekend.  \nSince none of this applies to this situation, I'd think it would be wise to have some sort of \"the talk\" with your sister, about boundries and trust.  \nBut in general, go for it!", "Bruh NTA that's dream ally material right there \n\nI'm bi and a DnD nerd, and if I found out a guy I knew was doing that for his gay little sister I'd probably fall for him right there", "Not the asshole but you better hope both your sister and her gf are responsible teens. Anything that happens in tht apartment is essentially your responsibility. Ngl if this was a hetero relationship I\u2019d highly highly suggest against this", "Spin the \"eva visits\" as cat sitting?", "Going NC with those parents sounds great tho, and the little sister will be old enough soon to make her own choices.", "Those ain\u2019t parents.", "I think that is a lovely think to do, tell Eva she can chill at your apartment and do whatever she wants, with a gentle wink. If she decides to have company, thats none of your business and you didn\u2019t even need to know. You\u2019ll be a great older sibling for doing that, let 16 year olds be 16 year olds fgs.", "I agree it\u2019s a wonderful thing to do but you are opening yourself to a potentially dangerous situation with vulnerable teenagers. Prepare yourself if worst case scenario happens which there is a decent chance if families are suspicious. I\u2019d also have a discussion about safe sex with them or get them set up with some clinic for any sti monitoring.", "They\u2019re not worth caring about.", "I mean yeah but those choices would shitty compared to further financial support.", "This is important, OP.  If you're going to give children your home to have sex in, make sure they're aware of the physical and emotional risks."]}
