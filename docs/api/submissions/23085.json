You're 25. An adult. What you do with your apartment is no business of your parents. If you want to give Eva access to your apartment one night a week, which happens to be the same night you also give access to Lucy, then you are perfectly entitled to do that.\n\nPlus you're not lying to your parents. You're just choosing to not tell them. There's a difference.\n\nIt is a wonderful gesture by the way. And I'm sure Eva and Lucy will be so grateful.", "NTA Quite the contrary, you would be an awesome big sister! Your sister has to deal with the fact that her parents don\u2019t accept who she is, that\u2019s really rough and it\u2019s probably going to be difficult for a really long time. By offering your apartment you\u2019d not only be giving your sister the opportunity to hang out with her girlfriend, you\u2019d also show your sister very decisively that she has someone in her corner and that\u2019s probably going to mean the world to her at this point", "YWBA\nYou would be awesome.

She may need some mental and emotional space to herself too, espec to distance herself from your homophobic parents", "YWBTAlly", "NTA. You're a great big sister for coming up with the idea. Apparently your parents and Lucy's parents have decided to forget the unconditional part of paternal love and are being complete a-holes about it. \n\nI know it's never easy for anyone to come out to their family, especially so if it happens due to \"getting caught in the act\" rather than on their own terms, so showing your sister that you're there for her and that she can actually trust in you, is something truly heartwarming. This will strengthen your bonds and make your little sister's life easier and probably a lot happier as well. \n\nI've had my own little sister come out to me a few years back, when she was about 25 years old. She's never been shy about saying what's on her mind, but that day she acted completely out of character. She lives on the other side of the country, so we were communicating via text, so when she told me she had something to tell me, I could immediately guess what she was about to tell me. I made sure to be as loving and supportive as any big brother could, and made sure she knew that I loved her no matter what. \n\nA few months later, my daughter (who lives with her mother a few hours drive from here) texted me the exact same line: \"hey, I've got something I need to tell you\". Well, she also knows that she's loved & that said love would never change for any reason. \n\nA parents job is to love and support their children. As long as your child isn't out there hurting others or breaking the law, you're supposed to be by their side no matter what. \n\nSometimes that \"burden\" (it's never a burden, but some parents seem to think it is) falls on siblings. You're being a great example, a great sibling and overall a great human being for being there for your sister. \n\nIf your parents find out somehow & blow up at you, tell them some random dude from Finland told them to f*** off and to get over themselves and their bs and actually think about their daughter and her happiness for once."]}
