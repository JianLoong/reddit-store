You're 25. An adult. What you do with your apartment is no business of your parents. If you want to give Eva access to your apartment one night a week, which happens to be the same night you also give access to Lucy, then you are perfectly entitled to do that.\n\nPlus you're not lying to your parents. You're just choosing to not tell them. There's a difference.\n\nIt is a wonderful gesture by the way. And I'm sure Eva and Lucy will be so grateful.", "NTA Quite the contrary, you would be an awesome big sister! Your sister has to deal with the fact that her parents don\u2019t accept who she is, that\u2019s really rough and it\u2019s probably going to be difficult for a really long time. By offering your apartment you\u2019d not only be giving your sister the opportunity to hang out with her girlfriend, you\u2019d also show your sister very decisively that she has someone in her corner and that\u2019s probably going to mean the world to her at this point", "YWBA\nYou would be awesome.

Seriously, they should be allowed to pursue happiness and they are so lucky to have you.

If this plan gets found out relationships could explode in both families, you may not be allowed any contact with your sister, or she and possibly her girlfriend could be kicked out of their homes - are you prepared to let them live with you if that happens?", "NTA you're an adult, you live by your own code.
