They have repeatedly and openly said they enjoy the business with us.\n\nAfter many busts, we couldn't find a good editor, so when my daughter graduated college three years ago, we asked her to edit our novels from now on, to which she happily agreed.

My daughter in general has dropped down to only calling once a week and taking hours to answer our texts, and now this.\n\nWe called her out on it, to which she got very defensive.

Not surprising she has a lacking social life when you homeschooled her and used her for free labor since she was 15. Promising profits is useless when you haven\u2019t made any in 10 years.

It sounds like it was a lot of work and a lot of time for not a whole lot of money.

Let her do that. I'm sure you can find another editor.", "YTA. She doesn't have to provide you with a reason that you deem worthy enough for her to say no. No is enough. She doesn't want to do it anymore. It doesn't matter if she used to want to do it or did it just to please you (which I suspect is the case). She doesn't anymore. She gets to decide where she spends her time and she has chosen not to spend it editing for you. Respect her choice.", "YTA, and if you've been doing thus since 2009...mate it's not working.

It is time for her to move on and start living her own life. She works, she has a place. This is the time in her life where she should be enjoying her free time.

Of course YTA, and stop trying to make it sound like her life is so empty that you're doing her a favor by having her spend hours working for peanuts for you", "Yta. Gosh, let her do her own thing! You are not paying her enough money for the job she does and from what you wrote it does not seem like her cut from the money you make from your writing is big enough to legitimise you trying to force her to basically do cheap labor for you.\n\nI suppose she realised how you are trying to exploit her to keep an unsuccessful business alive. If you went through traditional publishing you would have an editor through the publisher, so I suppose you self publish through Amazon or sth like this. This is not a sustainable business model and you should not make your daughter pay for it by not earning the money she deserves. It seems like you have written a few books so by now it should be clear to you that what you are doing is not working, be it writing wise or business wise.\n\nApart from that: why do you need to know her reasons for quitting? Let her be and give her the freedom to do her own thing and explore her own path. She is not a professional editor so it does not naturally make sense to haver her do this job unless you only seek cheap labor. Let her go and watch her thrive. Be proud of her.", "YTA. She went out and got her own life, apart from mom and dad. It seems like you'd like her to remain being the boring, friendless, dutiful daughter you described her as. She doesn't owe her your time. Maybe she doesn't find your stories interesting. Who knows? Bottom line, you guilting her for having her own life is intrusive. I completely understand why she's low contact with you. Keep it up and you might find out she's changed her phone number to go no contact completely.", "YTA She does not want to do it. END OF STORY. I can't get over the audacity of the two of you feeling so entitled in this situation. And then to go on about her lack of a social life? Like, what does that have to do with anything?! Of course you're the asshole for demanding she continues to edit your books. Leave her alone, let her life her own life.\n\nAnd let's be realistic here. There's very little chance this will become a profitable venture (I'm a writer, I know what an endless uphill battle it is). So don't act like your kids will come into some huge fortune for helping you out. Chances are, the rest of your kids will lose interest over time. This is YOUR dream, not theirs. Respect their decisions and stop acting like they're obligated to do anything for you.\n\nAnd $400-$500 to edit a novel is slave wages. OF COURSE she's not going to want to sacrifice so much of her time to do that.", "YTA.

You surely looked at what it would cost to hire a professional editor and were too fucking cheap to pay for it. Your daughter is an adult expressing appropriate boundaries.", "I swear I read this one a few months ago.\n\nYTA. Still.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to make the blanket decision that this is a family business and so everyone has to contribute. Your daughter is an adult and is making her own decisions. All power to her.", "You're going to keep posting this, and people are still going to tell you YTA, and... what? Your daughter clearly isn't going to help you edit anymore. Your publishing firm hasn't magically become Random House, and after ten years, if you still can't afford a professional editor, most likely won't. \n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize this, which is why a 25-year-old, however polite she's trying to be about it, is eager to follow her own, independent (and probably much more lucrative) path. At any rate, if you decide to carry on with this business, she will not be your editor. Your problem, not hers. Learning to deal with it would be a much more profitable use of your time.", "YTA\n\nYou're guilting your children into helping with an unsuccessful business. Instead of properly trying to start publishing with a professional editor and a marketing budget, you're hoping to get by cheaply using your adult children. \n\nYour kids deserve to have lives of their own. While they've likely told you they're happy to help, that's probably because they'd feel bad telling you no. You can't expect them to keep spending their 20s helping their aging parents with a pipe dream. \n\nIf you're serious about writing, then invest in it. Save up and hire professionals to help you with a story you believe in. If you're not confident enough for that, you're just wasting your children's time.", "YTA.

It's because you can exploit them by getting them to do the work of professionals for either very little or no payment.\n\nIf you really cared about spending time with your kids, you'd do things they like and enjoy.

So we'll move on to your questions:\n\nAre your children professional editors? Do they provide development, story, character, line, and proof? Each of these is a different skill set, though some can overlap. A good editor needs to be very active in the writing world and up on the current trends, so they can help make your book into what readers want. Are your children part of any writing organizations? Do they go to conferences? Do they participate in continuing education to keep their skills sharp? If the answer to any of these is no, your children are not suited to be your editors.\n\nOn top of that, an editor must be able to be very blunt and honest with the author(s) without worrying about hurt feelings. You need an equal power dynamic between an editor/writer, and there will never be one between a parent/child. It's unfair of you to expect them to take this on, and I highly doubt the whole family is so \"happily\" engaged in this cause, as you seem to think.\n\nMaking someone work for you from family obligation and on the promise of future gains is a manipulative asshole move.

Editing feedback. *I'm very open to feedback and take it all on board* they say and I laugh hollowly.

There are plenty of editors out there who can do a good job at a more affordable rate.

Your daughter\u2019s work duties might look \u201clight\u201d but it\u2019s still work and it\u2019s understandable that she might not want to spend her after hours time doing more for you. I\u2019ve seen my wife edit novel length books before. If someone is doing it right, it\u2019s intense and draining mental labor. You need to accept that she might be over that.\n\n3) You can\u2019t start a \u201cfamily business\u201d with children. What you essentially have is a business you wanted to start that you then involved your kids in.
