It doesn't seem like too much to ask to walk faster so that you don't disrupt/cause problems for those around you, and not stop randomly to look at a meme on your phone, especially in a place like NYC. I feel like your statement that he was acting \"too much like a tourist\" isn't really accurate based on your description, but rather that he just didn't respect the social rules and norms of the place he was visiting, which is just being rude and entitled IMO, and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being a tourist.

In your case, I don't know if you actually explained why things are done a certain way. If you did, and he didn't listen, you cannot be faulted for not wanting him back. If you just told him no for everything, then you have become a stereotypical new Yorker, and as such would be TA.", "He could stay with you and utilize the many professional tours available in NYC.  You shouldn't have to be the tour guide.  Then he can kibbitz with all the other Midwesterners about everything wrong with NY.  TBH, I've not been to NY and my knowledge comes from movies, TV, the New Yorker and David Sedaris.  I'm sure that is not the greatest education, although I would at least have better taste in places I want to see.  NTA.", "YTA, not for not inviting him again, you have no obligation to host someone, but I mean, he was a tourist, what do you expect? YTA for not expecting a tourist to be, well a tourist and getting pissed about it.\n\nHonestly everything about your post hits all the \"New Yorkers are AH's\" story points I've heard before about New York.\n\nNY is a tourist destination and having lived in such a location before where the local economy does depend on tourism the locals just have to suck it up, its sucks but if you don't like it then you and other locals need to apply political pressure to stop being a tourist destination and accept the economic downturn that brings.", "NTA. I sleep in late but on vacation, my family has plans and I don't want to delay them.", "NTA basic human decency in NYC boils down to making sure you don\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way, even if they are a stranger. Hence the fast pace, not stopping in the middle of a sidewalk, and especially not walking or standing in a bike lane. Despite the size there\u2019s 8 million people who live here, and then there\u2019s all the people who commute for work. He chose to not look at a map and realize how far away two neighborhoods in different boroughs were.\n\nAlso, who takes PTO to visit someone and doesn\u2019t ask if it\u2019s okay first?", "NTA. I am a tourist and don\u2019t behave like that. It\u2019s stupid, dangerous (bike lane??), likely to get you targeted by scam artists etc, and at the very least make you deeply unpopular. It\u2019s also no way to enjoy the city. And he thinks New Yorkers are the jerks?", "I\u2019ve never heard a more Detroit thing than to say NYC without tourists is just another Detroit \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA your cousin sounds like an awful guest. Waking up at noon, being annoyed at taking the train, being upset you warned him about buying fake bags, stopping in the middle of the street, walking in the bike line *multiple times??* All are reasons why you should not host this cousin again. \n\nAlso\u2026New Yorkers are permanently damaging their bodies by *walking fast*? Hilarious", "NTA. There's absolutely no reason why he should be back so soon and for so long. 2 weeks???", "I\u2019ve never been to NYC but even I know the difference. I weirdly miss buses and the subway as an easy way to travel from when I lived in London as a kid. It was nice not having to deal with parking.", "Same - had family come to Rome (outskirts). Nap the first day. Cool, I get it. Sleep until 11am every morning THEN want to \u201csee stuff?\u201d They thought I would give them a ride into the city center. Bwahhaha \u2026 and show them around. \n\nHad sent them an email weeks before: top ten things to see \u2026 couldn\u2019t be arsed to review & pick a few things. \n\nDidn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t do basic research. Didn\u2019t look at a map. Come visit, but I have a schedule and I\u2019m NOT a tour guide. I\u2019ve said this to visitors and they DO NOT believe me.", "Yeah it\u2019s the upper tip above Spanish Harlem. Think late 100s-200s", "I\u2019ll be in the ground before I drink from a public fountain in this city, and I\u2019m the kind of person that drinks tap water."]}
