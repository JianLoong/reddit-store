Last week, my cousin (M22) took a bus here from Detroit. He was super excited to visit, and I was excited to have him, but it was just not a good experience. For one, he took his time walking and refused to walk any faster because he was convinced the speed we walk here permanently damages our bodies. And he would suddenly stop in the middle of the street to take photos or try to show me memes. He would walk in the bike lane, causing him to get yelled at 3 different times, and he got mad at me for not letting him buy the counterfeit and stolen handbags laid out on the street. He also honestly thought we just drove or got Ubers everywhere, so he got really annoyed with me over us taking trains and buses. He also wanted me to take him to Coney Island and Flushing in the same day, which obviously was not going to happen since I live in Inwood. We ended up not doing much anyway, because he would wake up at noon and refused to get up earlier.\n\nFor the record, I talked to him multiple times about everything. He would give me excuses like, \"Not everybody is in a hurry, you know.\" Eventually he said that without tourists, my city would just be another Detroit.\n\nAfter an irritating 3 days, I dropped him off at Port Authority. He asked me when he could stay with me again, and I told him we would discuss that the next day. The second I got home from work, he called me and said that he already cleared it with his boss to take off 2 weeks in January. I declined and said he should use that time to visit his girlfriend in Miami. He asked if it was him, and I said yes and explained why. He swore up and down that that would never happen again, and I told him that it was just too much stress since he would never listen and insist the problem was New Yorkers being jerks and not him. He told me that we need to learn to enjoy life, and I hung up on him.\n\nAITA? Absolutely all of my friends that live here are on my side, but I also heard from a couple friends who have never been here that I was being a stereotypical New Yorker and that I owe him an apology. And he texted me saying, \"I genuinely have no clue what I did wrong. Could you at least explain it to me?\"", "created_utc": 1671238912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znu9rz/aita_for_not_inviting_my_cousin_back_to_manhattan/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to entertain people in the city and he should have asked you before taking the time off expecting to stay at your place for another two weeks. That\u2019s pretty entitled behavior. If he doesn\u2019t like the way people live there, why is he trying to spend so much time there?", "The fact he would get up at noon and refuse to get up earlier is grounds enough. NTA", "NTA. You did your best to be a good host, and he was not a considerate guest. The slow walking and inaccurate expectations are understandable because of his lack of experience, because the emphasis on cars and cabs is something people pick up from movies or shows set in NY. But sleeping until noon, relying on you to be a tour guide instead of treating you to shows or restaurants, and then asking to come for two weeks? That's a bit much.", "nta\u2026.whether it\u2019s nyc or international it\u2019s the job of tourists to respect local culture. entitled tourists are the worse.", "Tell he can come, but you won't play tour guide. Let him sort his own visit out. Plus, don't you work? \n\nNot glossing over the fact that he took time off work and invited himself over. Rude! NTA.", "NTA but you could try to walk him through why two weeks would be a long time in January in NYC vs Miami. For one, weather. Two, you can mention all of the things he disliked or spoke badly about.\n\nI think your cousin just might be a bit young and felt the need to defend Detroit vs NYC for some reason. If you talk with him again I would definitely tell him that 2 weeks is a lot when you can't do much of the out door activities that make NYC great.\n\nEdit: it sounds like he genuinely liked his time there and you were annoyed playing your guide, which is fair, but maybe another weekend trip in a different season should be suggested (2 weeks is crazy!). He must have a better idea of what NYC is all about now and hopefully will come back with that experience under his belt.", "Based on your description, it sounds like he was kind of entitled and judgemental about the norms/social etiquette, which, I can imagine would be really frustrating, especially since you were hosting and entertaining him. Also, his excuse for not walking at an appropriate speed is just bizzare...lol. It doesn't seem like too much to ask to walk faster so that you don't disrupt/cause problems for those around you, and not stop randomly to look at a meme on your phone, especially in a place like NYC. I feel like your statement that he was acting \"too much like a tourist\" isn't really accurate based on your description, but rather that he just didn't respect the social rules and norms of the place he was visiting, which is just being rude and entitled IMO, and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being a tourist. It sort of reminds me of the stereotypical stories you hear about some Americans when they're vacationing in other countries (they refuse to acknowledge any of the customs of the place they're visiting and complain about everything that's different from America). \n\nAt the end of the day, it's insane that you should be expected to allow someone to stay in your home, while you host them on their vacation if they're not going to be a respectful guest. NTA", "I've been to Detroit, and I've been to NYC. It's funny to me that your cousin had such trouble walking. Walking in NYC is just like driving in Detroit...\n\nNTA. He just doesn't sound like a good guest. There's nothing wrong with *being* a tourist, but you want to be a good guest, and pay attention when your host explains how things are.", "NTA. He can still visit Manhattan without seeing you. You already explained your reasons and he is not picking up what you're putting down.", "NTA. You don't have to let someone stay with you, nor do you have to play tour guide. But seriously, unless you are on a deadline there's no reason to rush everywhere, slow down a bit enjoy life. \n\n But I also can't believe he wasted so much time there.  I was in NY as a tourist for 5 nights and I was lucky if I got 5hrs sleep a night while there because I would leave the hotel at 8am, and not get back til between 1-2am.", "NTA I\u2019d get pissed to. You can be a tourist and not be an inconsiderate person. Standing in bike lanes is just fucking stupid.", "Lived in New York..\n You should have just let him get hit by a bike and saved yourself the future trouble.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Respectfully, this is why I'd never visit NYC. I couldn't keep up with the pace. If you're going to be in someone's space like that you have to be sort of flexible too. Not to mention gracious.", "NTA. \n\nNYC will always be NYC, regardless of tourists. It\u2019s the people living there who make each borough and neighborhood in NYC what it is. Except Times Square lol\n\nHe\u2019s not a good tourist, he\u2019s not a good guest. He wants to be a tourist in his way, but it would be the same as if he were visiting another country. He\u2019s not obeying laws and societal norms for that area, and acts indignant that he should.", "As a fellow native New Yorker, you have my sympathies. NTA.\n\nI have the shitty luck of having the homophobic/culturally insensitive/Islamophobic relatives, who has visited. If it wasn\u2019t them complaining about the prices of products, they were referring to people as slurs and quoting Bible verses.", "NTA. Being a tourist isn\u2019t good  but it really is his lack of consideration for your time that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019ve been to New York a few times and never had a bad experience. I think mainly because I was aware people had places to be. The city is big and filled with people. If they didn\u2019t move quickly nothing would ever get done. People need to learn to respect the culture of the places they visit.", "Everyone is the asshole. Your cousin for not planning the visit properly and not listening to your advice. And you acting like you don't have the time. You know the city and he doesn't. \n\nBefore his visit, did you guys talk about him visiting? Or did he just drop in without notice?", "YTA, he WAS a tourist and you ARE a typical New Yorker. You could have shown a bit more hospitality rather than just expecting him to instantly adapt to New York life and honestly imo the city is the dregs of society so I can\u2019t see why he\u2019d want to come back so badly.

I never say anything about his area's lack of transportation despite my epilepsy making it impossible for me to have a license.
