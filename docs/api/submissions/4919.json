It doesn't seem like too much to ask to walk faster so that you don't disrupt/cause problems for those around you, and not stop randomly to look at a meme on your phone, especially in a place like NYC. I feel like your statement that he was acting \"too much like a tourist\" isn't really accurate based on your description, but rather that he just didn't respect the social rules and norms of the place he was visiting, which is just being rude and entitled IMO, and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with being a tourist.

People live here. People work here. People\u2019s entire lives are here. \n\nI walk past the cafe from FRIENDS on my way to work everyday (Owl Cafe? Something like that). On multiple occasions, I\u2019ve had tourists try to stop me from walking past because \u201cjust a minute, we\u2019re taking a picture!\u201d And they\u2019re trying to do that stupid jumping freeze frame picture\u2026 Everytime I blow through and EVERY TIME they act like I\u2019m the asshole for ruining it. I don\u2019t want to be late for work! ***IM WALKIN\u2019 HERE!!!***", "It works the other way too - don\u2019t move to NYC if you can\u2019t stand tourists. As a recent tourist to NYC who didn\u2019t do any touristy things, the other typical tourists were annoying, but I expected them to be like that."]}
