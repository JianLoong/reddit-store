I honestly thought he\u2019d cleaned up his act as I couldn\u2019t smell him anymore, until a friend dropped by to see me, plugged up her nose and said quietly \u201cOMG\u201d and ran away. I went to my drawer, found this ultra smelly hand cream bottle and smelled it; nothing. It was then I realised I\u2019d completely lost my sense of smell (probably my body\u2019s reaction to dealing sitting next to the guy). A specialist confirmed it. I guessed I was now the perfect person to sit next to him. It\u2019s been years now, he\u2019s long gone and my smell has partially come back.

It did turn out, though, that the individual was struggling.

However, it would be best coming from their line manager in case your intention is misconstrued.", "NTA  Go to your office manager.  When you get a job somewhere there is the expectation of self hygiene.  If the employee cannot be hygienic enough to not smell bad then something must be done.  Granted, there ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL reasons that someone would have bad body odor all the time, but those are rare MEDICAL ISSUES, so nothing can be done about that particular situation.  If it's because the person doesn't bathe regularly, then they NEED to informed.  Bad BO CAN AFFECT THE BUSINESS.  The patients (I am fairly certain) don't like it and you guys could be losing clients if this is a daily thing.  There are ways of telling someone they have bad hygiene that are kinder than others, although this situation is inherently fraught with possibility of offending the odor offender.  \n\nHave the staff come together to the management or all sign a note to state that something needs to be done.  If it's a medical condition...I don't know, but if it's other than that, I really hope she learns.

Very much seen on the same level as wearing pale coloured tights (uniform) or keeping our hair tied back - part of the expectation so it was dealt with in the same way, crisply and to the point.

I can promise you that someone in my position is the correct person to handle this. Because the manager's previous attempts didn't work, I think you need to first be more blunt to them when asking them to address it. Be clear and firm, maybe using stronger language. Don't be afraid to emphasize that the *stench* is lingering in patient rooms, which means it's also lingering on the patients themselves!! EWW! Focus on how it looks bad for the practice to have a representative who doesn't follow healthy hygiene practices. If you're at a salon, the front desk worker has to look like they work at a salon. Same for a medical practice; she needs to look as though she works at a medical practice! That is typically my focus when I have to talk to people about this. Instead of talking about alienating coworkers or clients by being gross, I  focus on how healthy hygiene is an important aspect of representing the company you work for. So model that for the OM by making that your own focus.", "NTA I work in the ag industry and I have a coworker like this.

I would be so embarrassed and ashamed if I knew I stunk and was inches from a person's face. We even have spray deodorants in the bathroom just in case any one of us feels less than fresh. The baskets were a.... Nice idea in theory but I do think there needs to be a more targeted approach. Especially if patients are complaining.

And I just found out today we had a patient complain about it \ud83d\ude15", "Agree.  If she's using \"natural\" deodorant (which does not work - I learned this the hard way, unfortunately) she probably wouldn't change to whatever was given out due to preference for the stuff she's already using.  If she's depressed or something (not washing clothes or body regularly is a symptom), having the items given to you isn't going to solve the problem of odor either.\n\nThis requires direct, but caring, conversation - preferably by a superior or HR.", "I understand that part, but if it's a medical condition where the BO can't be controlled or eliminated, then OP and the co-workers are going to have to figure out an alternative.
