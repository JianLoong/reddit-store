You shouldn't feel obligated or pressured into mentioning a miscarriage at your quince. It would have created an awkward and uncomfortable atmosphere that would put a damper on your special day. You also had a right to point out that your aunt was not taking care of herself while pregnant, as irresponsible behavior can sometimes cause miscarriages. \n\nYou did the right thing in speaking up for yourself, and your aunt's reaction was out of line. It is understandable that some people disagree with your decision and are taking your aunt's side, but ultimately your quince is your day and no one can make you do something you don't want to do.", "you are not in the wrong.    i\u2019m POC and it\u2019s difficult to reason with family like this.  some how you\u2019re always at fault.     stick by your choice. tell you aunt we can do a memorial another day.   if she\u2019s not okay with that she can go fuck herself ( don\u2019t tell her the last part)    \n\nlet her know that you are sorry even if you aren\u2019t abt being mean and bring a compromise.    i usually tends to work with people like those makes them see that they\u2019ve \u201c won \u201c and let\u2019s you our worry free.    \n\nit can be such a shit feeling to apologise for something you aren\u2019t wrong abt but with someone e like her this is the only way i see it work.", "Nta. A Quince is a celebration. It's your birthday party to celebrate you. It is not a memorial for a dead fetus. If your aunt wants to do a celebration of almost life for her almost child then  she can do it on her dime and her time.", "NTA. If she wanted a tribute to her unborn baby she could have a memorial that\u2019s not at your event so the focus be about them. The fact she waited and decided to try to take your day from you just seems spiteful. You\u2019re not a brat, you just don\u2019t want to turn what should be him your day and happy occasion into a depressing and messy one.", "NTA. The family siding with her are enabling toxic behavior.", "Think I'm going YTA cause dis gotta be fake. Mom is dead. Mom is getting phone blown up. Even Mama doesn't call you out on going too far? If this isn't fake, you and auntie are drama llamas cut from the same cloth", "NTA. However I wonder if your aunt is wanting this because she saw someone else honor a deceased child or or family member at a previous quince she attended. My friend\u2019s daughter had her quince a coupe of years ago and the family had a framed picture of a baby they lost to SIDS. I know it\u2019s not quite the same bc it\u2019s a miscarriage of your aunt\u2019s baby and not a sibling, but you should talk with someone who is helping you plan this and find out what would be the most appropriate thing to do. And try to keep an open mind. It is your day, but part of the day\u2019s festivities are for giving honor to your family and friends. (And sometimes that means having to honor people who have not done anything to deserve it). A moment of silence is something that has bern done for a deceased family member at quinces or weddings. Whether or not your aunt caused the miscarriage should not be part of the decision-making process. It does sound like your aunt is pretty entitled and messed up, and how she and some of your relatives are acting is also pretty f-ed up. However, you have to decide whether or not it\u2019s worth it to die on this hill. Will the drama overshadow the whole event and ruin your day? Will giving a short mention and a moment of silence get all of them to shut TF up about it and then you can have the other 1439 minutes of the day to enjoy yourself? This is not going to enable your aunt\u2019s reckless behavior. Besides, the honor is to the victim of her behavior.  \n\nHonestly I\u2019m surprised she wants people to know about her miscarriage bc it invites whispering, judgement, uncomfortable questions, gossiping m, and speculation.  Maybe you could tell her that\u2019s the reason you don\u2019t want to do it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
