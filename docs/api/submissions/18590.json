His girlfriend (54F) partially lives there with him but also has her own place in a different town where she works. My and my father have always been very close and I've always gotten the feeling that she didn't like that for some reason. This past weekend there was a family thing in my hometown and my dad had already asked if my sister and I would come up north and spend the weekend there. My dad has two spare-bedrooms (mine and my brother's from childhood, my older sister grew up with her mom so she didn't have a room) but only one of them has a bed. Since my sister and her daughter would be taking the spare bed I said I'd bring an air-mattress. We didn't talk about this again for a few weeks. Both busy with work and such. My sister then goes up north on Friday and texts me in the evening asking when I'll be there. I respond with \"not until tomorrow, btw I forgot to tell dad I'd come on Saturday and only stay one night. Can you brief him in?\" and she was like \"Haha, sure\". An hour later or so I get a call from my father saying that his girlfriend had left. I was like \"Uh, ok?\" since I didn't even know she was there in the beginning. So the reason why she left is that she didn't know I was coming and that I was staying and she hates how comfortable I am in her house. I grew up there for 18 years so I'll just get food from the fridge without asking, take a bath etc. Apparently she finds this extremely rude. I had no idea. Personally, I don't think that it's weird behaviour but I honestly don't know. Dad's understandably sad about everything because she didn't even say goodbye. She just heard that I was coming and that I was staying the night and packed her bags and left for her house in another town and didn't respond to my dad's calls and texts. When my dad told my about this I offered to just stay in a hotel. He said that it probably didn't matter now because his gf probably wasn't coming back for the weekend. I stayed in a hotel anyway, just in case it made things easier for my father.  \n\n\nI called my dad today to see how he was doing after the weekend and he said that he finally reached his gf a few days later and they were talking again and that he needed to place firmer boundaries with me and that I couldn't behave anyway I wanted. I had to respect that this wasn't my home anymore but a home that he shares with his gf and I need to follow their rules. I must admit it feels like their her rules but idk.. am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1685483552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w3b7o/aita_for_expecting_to_be_welcome_at_my_childhood/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I doubt it is technically hers, either. It's your dads. So it's on him to handle boundaries and rules. For some reason, I suspect there is more to the story about your activities than just looking in the fridge or getting a bath, but who knows, maybe not. I suspect his girlfriend has also brought things up to him before and maybe he didn't address it. That might also be wrong. There's a lot about this situation that makes it unclear. \n\nBut if no one has communicated any rules or expectations different than what you've always done, then NTA.", "This is something you need to talk to your dad more about.  \n\nIf you ate her clearly marked lunch that would be one thing. Or taking a hour long bath when people need to use the restroom.\n\nBut it sounds like the gf is trying to alienate you from your dad.  Makes you out to be a bad child and throws a fit, refusing to talk to him for days.  \n\nYou have to be careful, but ask if she does this often when they disagree-  storm out and refuse to talk?   Try and set limits for your dad and his guests in his own home?  That sounds very controlling. NTA for situations as described. \n\nIt also may be time to do some estate planning. So that you can keep your dad in his house for as long as possible.", "NTA\n\n> I need to follow their rules. \n\nI don't see a single \"rule\" she accused you of breaking.\n\n>  I'll just get food from the fridge without asking, take a bath etc\n\nYeah? You're a guest. Why *would* you ask permission for *every little thing*?\n\nIt sounds like she's got a massive issue with female autonomy.", "Grown children who visit me and feel free to open my fridge and take baths when they want are the ultimate gift to me- I feel so great when they know they are still coming home.", "YNTA\nIt's his girlfriend not his fiance or wife. You're his flesh and blood. It's not her house so her getting pissy rubs me wrong. It sounds to me like she's got her hooks into your dad and is manipulating/controlling him.", "You are caught in the middle of your dad and his gf's couple spat. No boundaries were expressed to you in advance and you literally did not even stay there that weekend when you found out there was a problem in the hopes of appeasing said gf\n\nIt actually sounds like your dad may have known the details in advance but not that she would leave (or didn't believe she would if she told him) and so didn't bother to talk to you about her concerns.\n\nYou weren't given a chance to work out these issues because they are not actually about you, even if your behavior (or the expectation of how you might behave) triggered their fight\n\nBasically, whether or not you did something wrong in the past is immaterial; you're certainly NTA now & have done enough to show you're down to work with gf to make sure she's comfortable when you're visiting. The rest... Probably better to stay out of", "NTA. It is your father\u2019s house not his GF\u2019s and he was Ok until now.  now that he set rules, you need to follow them", " NTA! Your dads GF has issues that probably go back way longer than the time she\u2019s been with your dad. It\u2019s sad when personal issues cause family rifts. But that\u2019s where you are. You didn\u2019t overstep any boundaries nor did you do anything wrong. It\u2019s your dads house and he is the one who needs to establish boundaries, and it sounds like he has. I personally think his support should have been for you. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s trying to keep the peace and this is his way of doing so. Next time your dad asks you to visit be sure he is crystal clear about the details. All you did was go to visit your dad, when invited by him to visit. How could you possibly be held accountable for his GF\u2019s hang ups and reactions. My advice , though, would be to take the higher ground. It sounds like visits are not frequent so it won\u2019t be an often occurring issue. Include gf in plans to appease her and her jealousies and if issues continue it\u2019s your dads problem to contend with. Good luck! You seem like a good person, hope it works out for you.", "NTA as you've stated it.  You were invited to stay by the owner of the home and it was up to your dad to smooth these issues over before you came.  It's clear this is probably an ongoing point of contention between him and his GF and that he hid the fact that you were coming until the last minute.\n\nThat said, I think there's a happy medium to be had between her demand that you respect the rules of *her* house and you, at 33, acting like it is your childhood home and you have a right to do, eat, or use anything you want in the house without asking. Your dad is not a reliable mediator, so you're probably going to have to talk to GF yourself.", "NTA. \n\nThe issue here is not about placing boundaries for you. It's that your dad needs a new girlfriend. She finds you - her bf's daughter - uncomfortable because of how you act in the house that *you grew up in.* On top of it, she is already claiming it as HER house AND is forcing a wedge between you and your father.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the time when your dad needs to make a difficult decision, and I really REALLY hope he sees what she is doing to his family. I think the only way he is going to start getting the message is if you only visit your dad when she is 100% not there.\n\nI hope things work out!", "Info: It sounds like it\u2019s your dads house. So what boundaries has he set? Is he cool with you treating the house as your own? \n\nI don\u2019t see what else matters here. You\u2019re a full grown adult so if told to not treat the house as your own you should be able to accept that. GF has no business setting the rules in your dads house (I assume dad owns the house since you grew up there)", "NTA this is on your dad. He needs to decide what he wants your role in the house to be - Are you a guest or are you coming Home? There are some parents (shitty ones IMO) who put their kids in the guest category when they move or are kicked out.  His girlfriend clearly wants that space to be a shared home between him and her. She doesn\u2019t want you to think of it as home where you have equal or more rights/control than her. She wants to be the woman of the house. And it sounds like your dad knew that but didn\u2019t bother to either shut her down and say his kids can always call this place home or tell you that you need to be more formal and acknowledge her as a primary resident.  He needs to decide and make it clear  or else of course things like this will keep happening.", "NTA up til now, as your dad's gf apparently didn't address the issue until this visit. But she's now made it known that she doesn't want you treating her home as yours, so you need to respect that. Yes, this was your childhood home, but now it's theirs. That means you should treat this as if you were a guest - don't invite yourself over but rather ask permission/wait to be invited, ask before helping yourself to food, and generally do your best to be considerate of their space. Think about how you'd behave if you were staying with an acquaintance, and go from there.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s answer should have been \u201cno, you are always welcome to stay here\u201d. He messed up the moment he agreed to you going to a hotel. They only person who needs boundaries is her. I\u2019d be cutting ties with my parent if they ever did me like that.", "Nah.  It\u2019s doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for being comfortable in your childhood home.  But your dad and his new girlfriend aren\u2019t either for setting boundaries.  It\u2019s not your home anymore.  Your father has moved on to a new relationship and he\u2019s not wrong to prioritize her.", "It's your childhood home, how dare she dictate what you can do and what not there? That's beyond who 'owns' the house, you grew up there, so many memories, if you don't feel comfortable there then where will you? Lol this is not normal, of course NTA. That's also your house , I wouldn't accept her behaviour if I was you.", "NAH.  This is beyond reddit's paygrade.  \n\nThere are two options here:\n\n1.  There was some kind of major misunderstanding, and the 3 of you need to has it out and figure wtf is going on.  \n\n2.  She is just down right crazy / jealous.  \n\nAnd I don't think there is any amount of in fo's that would get us to that info.  I tend to have to think there was some type of misunderstanding - something making this out to be more than it is otherwise.  And none of us here on reddit can judge that.", "\u201cDad, you\u2019re right. Your house is no longer my home. I was unaware you and your gf had new rules in place regarding my visiting you after your invitation to me to visit you. Please accept my apologies for breaking rules I knew nothing about.\u201d\n\nNTA. But know that this gf is now dictating his house, and for whatever reason you\u2019re left out in the cold. Your relationship with your dad will suffer for it. \n\nBTW - is your sister treated the same way?", "Yes YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you lived there, it literally isn\u2019t your house anymore.

I have not lived at home since 18.  I never even lived with my dad regularly - just visited every other weekend.

I'll get up and say \"I'm gonna make coffee. Who wants some?\" whereas my sister will ask \"Could I have a cup of coffee please?\". I guess she is also just calmer and a more polite person than I am. Honestly, I can be a lot. I laugh loudly and joke around a lot. You know the type.", "When I\u2019m at a parent\u2019s house as guest, I absolutely help myself to stuff in the fridge.", "I think this entirely depends on the family and your culture. My nuclear family absolutely helps themselves to anything they like in each other\u2019s houses, especially the house we grew up in. I don\u2019t live there anymore, haven\u2019t for 20 years, but mom would be really upset if we started asking for stuff and acting like we were formal guests. Most people I know, when going back to the house they grew up in, acts like they still live there while there. I have close friends where we walk into each other\u2019s homes, if we\u2019re expected, without knocking, and absolutely take a drink from the fridge without asking. I also clean bathrooms and do laundry while I\u2019m at my mom\u2019s, and help with whatever she needs. This is in no way unusual. \n\nWhat matters is what boundaries the home owner wants to set and communicate, and those being respected.

Like I kinda felt something was up and that she didn't like me coming but I wasn't sure and since no one said anything to me I just didn't think about it and just went on being myself.", "Seriously?  If you invited your parents over and they took something out of the fridge you\u2019d be mad at them?", "Everyone\u2019s experiences are different. I would be more upset if family didn\u2019t feel comfortable helping themselves than if they did. It seems in this case helping yourself is clearly an accepted behavior.  The rude behavior in my opinion is when gf got upset and left. Nothing happened at that point. OP wasn\u2019t even on the scene yet. GF should have properly used her words, discussed what was bothering her, and establish an atmosphere that fostered open communication. I get the feeling that OP is not difficult to get along with. Instead gf threw a fit and left when all that was happening is a woman was visiting her father after he invited her to do so.", "That\u2019s right, because what you\u2019ve said is not the lynchpin as to whether they\u2019re the asshole.  And even if OP\u2019s behavior was strange (it\u2019s definitely not), the gf\u2019s behavior is bizarre and immature.

You should hear and respect bounderys as she has rights to fell that house like her home, but one thing is respect and a different one is property.", "NTA - i can\u2019t imagine walking into my parents house and not being able to just be comfortable and grab something from the fridge", "I go in my sisters fridge\u2026 casually\u2026 and I sometimes take a grocery bag\u2026. If your dad set boundaries and you step over them ok. But he didn\u2019t even set any. \nAnd an adult entering a relationship with a person with kids (adult or minors) should just expect things like them visiting overnight ect\u2026 if the kids is not doing that then the parent/child relationship is probably not healthy.", "I suspect she feels insecure as it's the old family home, it's where dad lived with ex wife. She probably feels like outsider. \nNTA it's your family home you should feel comfortable but I wonder if it wasn't the house you grew up on would you act the same? For example if dad and gf brought a house together would you help yourself to food? \nWould probably be best for dad and gf to start fresh somewhere, think she would feel better in a house with no past.", "It sounds like your dad has a lot of issues with boundaries and women. This is his third serious relationship?", "Dude. At your parents' house, unless you were raised by monsters, the fridge is fair game. That's every family I know at least.\n\nWere your parents super controlling or something? I'm really sorry if that's the case.", "Totally understand!", "No and I would be shocked if my kids (mid 20s) did this. They know we shop to a menu, so if they score cottage cheese with their breakfast we're down an ingredient for Friday's lasagna. \n\nEither I offer an open pantry/fridge with a few caveats or they ask. There are six of us so maybe that makes a difference? \n\nBut my mom, my brother and I didn't have a lot, so it was regulated in her household as well."]}
