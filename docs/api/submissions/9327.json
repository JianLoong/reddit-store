I (24M) am Canadian and have been in the US for 10 months, where I have been living with my American girlfriend (25F) for 7 of them. My time in the US is almost up, and I'm stressing about having to return to Canada. For one, my family is reliant on me to make money to support my grandma and pay for her medical support. I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.\n\nMy girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house. Her car was in an accident last month and has been in the shop, so she's been going to do work in the boba shop by our house. Before anyone asks, I am not able to do the work I do during the day outside of the house, which is why I leave in the evening.\n\nToday, my friend was over and was sitting on the couch, where my girlfriend usually eats lunch. I say couch, but it's really an oversized loveseat. My girlfriend went to go sit in her usual spot to eat lunch, but I asked her if she could eat in the kitchen instead so she would have more room to eat. She went to the kitchen, but I could tell she was pissed. When I asked her if everything was ok, she said she was tired of me controlling her. I think she's being selfish and not considering that I need a certain environment to concentrate and get work done, and that I am doing all of this for her and my family and one day I will be able to spend all the time in the world with her, but that right now I am really grinding and most strong relationships are built on sacrifice. So, AITA for asking my girlfriend to accommodate my work schedule?", "created_utc": 1675730596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vnhh8/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_leave_the_house/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The relationship just sounds like it isn't working anymore. You may love her but you're not spending any time with her and are treating her like she's not allowed to be in the same room as you.

I understand her giving you space while you're working but it's really just odd that you guys are at the point of not even being in the house together at the same time.

In the long run, what are you two going to do if you ever need to do any sort of work around her? She would have to leave all the time? The apartment is too small for your situation.

The problem is not your girlfriend invading your office space, your problem is that you don't even *have* office space. Rent an office, or build a broom closet in your home to retreat into.\n\nI am well aware that neither are actually possible. However I wish to point out that you are getting an unfairly good deal here, and it's causing harm to your relationship.", "YTA and yes you are being weirdly controlling about your joint home.

Go to the library", "YTA. You're insufferable. Your girlfriend should dump you.", "YTA. If you need a secluded space to work, YOU stay in the bedroom.

If you want to be alone, leave.", "If your family is in Canada, including your grandmother, why do you need to pay for medical for her? Isn\u2019t healthcare free in Canada or am I mistaken some how?

(probably on that one because she needs to leave her house) Your GF is an adult paying for  half of the rent. She is entitled to sit where she wants and come and go as she pleases. If you need quiet, YOU spend all day cooped up in the bedroom. \n\nI\u2019d be done with you.", "Why do you care if she has enough room to eat? She can monitor her own space, just fine. Just admit you wanted her to eat in the kitchen. It wasn\u2019t about how much space she had.\n\nETA: your friend can eat there, but she can\u2019t, can you see how wrong that is? Who is paying half the rent again? This is so weird", "Oh ok.  You wrote \u201cshe\u201d in your OP.  I guess you meant your girlfriend, but the sentence reads like you wanted your friend to have more room to eat.", "Ahah so you were jealous that he was taking pics of her foot - and instead of telling him you don't like it, you'd rather send your gf in the kitchen. Nice move so brave of you. How much money are you sending home - you sound insufferable tbh manipulative and always putting blame on others.", "Long term care homes generally are though. If she needs that level of support, that's likely the better option.", "I go to the same boba shop as she does during the day, but at night. I have work during the day that I cannot do outside of the house", "Not against her will. She chose to stay because she loves me, as I love her", "And once he does, she\u2019ll realize how much happier she is without him.", "I actually do/did most of the cleaning around the house, that was a point of contention in the past but she does more chores now. I could easily pay rent fully, I don't need her to clean stuff, I just like her presence when I do get the opportunity to hang out with her", "Facts, I bet she secured that apartment and is the only one on the lease and will continue to be in the apartment after he returns to Canada. Sounds like he doesn\u2019t enjoy being around her and is using her for the \u2018shared\u2019 apartment.", "he was testing out his new camera and jokingly taking pictures of her feet, I didn't want her next to him", "my culture doesn't do that", "What do you mean, you can't do it outside of the house? I mean, unless you're doing porn, I really can't think of anything that would tether you to your home like that so I'm curious.", "No, that's emotional manipulation. YTA", "Would you be ok if she left after you asked her to stay?", "actually, it was my apartment first. I asked her to move in when the lease on her place was up. I love her and enjoy being around her, just not when I am working", "So you exiled your girlfriend instead of asking your friend to stop.\n\nYTA. If you can't prioritize a relationship with someone who pays equal rent, then you shouldn't be in a relationship. If my partner tried to kick me out *every day* for 7-8 hours a day, he wouldn't be my partner anymore.", "Wtf.", "He was not joking\u2026.\n\nAlso YTA", "I can admit when I\u2019m wrong, you said just not when I am working so why did you send her away when your friend was there? \u201cMore space\u201d for her isn\u2019t a reasonable excuse, she decided to sit and eat there believing there was enough space for her to do so.", "Then why do you leave in the evening, when she is allowed to return. You're not working then right?", "I am. I go to the same boba shop at night to do work for clients on a different time zone. She's my best friend, which is why I want to live in the same city with her in the future, even if we aren't living compatible.", "Sounds like you're more invested in the work than your girlfriend, so she's reasonably upset. You really need to decide if the jobs or the girlfriend are more important because she's likely not going to put much effort into the relationship once she goes to Spain."]}
