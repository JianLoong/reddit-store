I (24M) am Canadian and have been in the US for 10 months, where I have been living with my American girlfriend (25F) for 7 of them. My time in the US is almost up, and I'm stressing about having to return to Canada. For one, my family is reliant on me to make money to support my grandma and pay for her medical support. I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.\n\nMy girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house. Her car was in an accident last month and has been in the shop, so she's been going to do work in the boba shop by our house. Before anyone asks, I am not able to do the work I do during the day outside of the house, which is why I leave in the evening.\n\nToday, my friend was over and was sitting on the couch, where my girlfriend usually eats lunch. I say couch, but it's really an oversized loveseat. My girlfriend went to go sit in her usual spot to eat lunch, but I asked her if she could eat in the kitchen instead so she would have more room to eat. She went to the kitchen, but I could tell she was pissed. When I asked her if everything was ok, she said she was tired of me controlling her. I think she's being selfish and not considering that I need a certain environment to concentrate and get work done, and that I am doing all of this for her and my family and one day I will be able to spend all the time in the world with her, but that right now I am really grinding and most strong relationships are built on sacrifice. So, AITA for asking my girlfriend to accommodate my work schedule?", "created_utc": 1675730596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vnhh8/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_leave_the_house/", "score": 573, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The relationship just sounds like it isn't working anymore. You may love her but you're not spending any time with her and are treating her like she's not allowed to be in the same room as you.

I understand her giving you space while you're working but it's really just odd that you guys are at the point of not even being in the house together at the same time.

In the long run, what are you two going to do if you ever need to do any sort of work around her? She would have to leave all the time? The apartment is too small for your situation.

The problem is not your girlfriend invading your office space, your problem is that you don't even *have* office space. Rent an office, or build a broom closet in your home to retreat into.\n\nI am well aware that neither are actually possible. However I wish to point out that you are getting an unfairly good deal here, and it's causing harm to your relationship.", "YTA and yes you are being weirdly controlling about your joint home.

Go to the library", "YTA. You're insufferable. Your girlfriend should dump you.", "YTA. If you need a secluded space to work, YOU stay in the bedroom.

If you want to be alone, leave.", "If your family is in Canada, including your grandmother, why do you need to pay for medical for her? Isn\u2019t healthcare free in Canada or am I mistaken some how?
