I (24M) am Canadian and have been in the US for 10 months, where I have been living with my American girlfriend (25F) for 7 of them. My time in the US is almost up, and I'm stressing about having to return to Canada. For one, my family is reliant on me to make money to support my grandma and pay for her medical support. I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.\n\nMy girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house. Her car was in an accident last month and has been in the shop, so she's been going to do work in the boba shop by our house. Before anyone asks, I am not able to do the work I do during the day outside of the house, which is why I leave in the evening.\n\nToday, my friend was over and was sitting on the couch, where my girlfriend usually eats lunch. I say couch, but it's really an oversized loveseat. My girlfriend went to go sit in her usual spot to eat lunch, but I asked her if she could eat in the kitchen instead so she would have more room to eat. She went to the kitchen, but I could tell she was pissed. When I asked her if everything was ok, she said she was tired of me controlling her. I think she's being selfish and not considering that I need a certain environment to concentrate and get work done, and that I am doing all of this for her and my family and one day I will be able to spend all the time in the world with her, but that right now I am really grinding and most strong relationships are built on sacrifice. So, AITA for asking my girlfriend to accommodate my work schedule?", "created_utc": 1675730596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vnhh8/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_leave_the_house/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The relationship just sounds like it isn't working anymore. You may love her but you're not spending any time with her and are treating her like she's not allowed to be in the same room as you.

I understand her giving you space while you're working but it's really just odd that you guys are at the point of not even being in the house together at the same time.

In the long run, what are you two going to do if you ever need to do any sort of work around her? She would have to leave all the time? The apartment is too small for your situation.

The problem is not your girlfriend invading your office space, your problem is that you don't even *have* office space. Rent an office, or build a broom closet in your home to retreat into.\n\nI am well aware that neither are actually possible. However I wish to point out that you are getting an unfairly good deal here, and it's causing harm to your relationship.", "YTA and yes you are being weirdly controlling about your joint home.

Go to the library", "YTA. You're insufferable. Your girlfriend should dump you.", "YTA. If you need a secluded space to work, YOU stay in the bedroom.

If you want to be alone, leave.", "If your family is in Canada, including your grandmother, why do you need to pay for medical for her? Isn\u2019t healthcare free in Canada or am I mistaken some how?

My ex and I had a similar situation where we were both working from home during COVID whereas he used to work out of an office building.  We both needed a certain environment, and so one of us used the living area, while the other used the bedroom.  It was pretty hellish trying to navigate that sudden change, we both felt trapped in a tiny space, and we got on each other's nerves constantly.\n\nHe continued working from home after things opened up again, and while that wasn't ideal, neither of us ever told the other that they needed to leave for X number of hours every day.  We were both paying equally for the space, which meant we both had the right to be there when we wanted and needed to be.", "Info: can I ask what medical support you\u2019re paying for for your grandma?", "Why don\u2019t you work in the bedroom instead of banishing your gf there? She has a right to be in the space she pays for. YTA, it\u2019s you who needs to find a work around so your GF isn\u2019t forced out of the house.

What's sad is that she can't see what's going on and know to get TF out. Sounds to me like now just is not a good time for a relationship for you, and that's ok. You need to pick a priority: work or GF. If the choice must be work then end things amicably or tone back the relationship. I don't know what is best for you, but what I do know is that it doesn't appear your work situation and relationship are compatible right now (not to say things couldn't work at a later time) and you are becoming manipulative bc you are afraid of somebody you love leaving you. You reek of insecurity, and that's ok, but what is not ok is being emotionally manipulative towards your partner.", "Why don\u2019t YOU move to the bedroom and let her have the rest of the house?", "YTA. It\u2019s her home and she\u2019s just as entitled to be in it as you. You should go to the bedroom to work or go to a library. Stop ordering her around in her own home", "YTA. Most relationships, strong or not, are NOT built on sacrifice. Not the healthy ones.", "YTA. If you're working that much and can't afford a bigger apartment, something is very wrong. Are you even on a visa that allows you to work in the US? Then you're going to move to /Spain/?? What kind of weird story is this.\n\nI can't get past you telling her to go into the kitchen to eat. You keep saying it is so she could have more space but that is so absurd I can't process.", "YTA man this really annoyed me.

Not being allowed back in the place I called home, my safe place until he ok\u2019d it. It made it feel less like home every time.
