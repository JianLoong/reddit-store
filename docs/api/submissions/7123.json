I told her that while I understand that he is only 11, his body has obviously started changing and it wouldn't be a bad thing to introduce him to cleaning his face with a cleanser and popping on some deodorant after his showers. Sarah got really upset with me for \"trying to make Sam grow up too quickly\" and didn't want to talk about it anymore. For context, Sarah and I are very close and she considers me to be Sam's \"bonus mum\" which is why I felt it was appropriate to bring it up with her. \n\nWhen I got home, I talked to my partner about the conversation I had with Sarah and he said that he wanted to go out and get some basic skin care and deodorant for Sam so he could have a chat to him on our next weekend and  explain that he's getting older and his body is changing and it's important to to look after his skin and wear deodorant, etc. \n\nToday, we went out and bought a nice little toiletries bag and a gentle cleanser and moisturiser for young skin (we talked to the pharmacist about what would be best) and some deodorant and put it all in the toiletries bag ready for when Sam next stays with us so my partner can chat to him about what we've bought, how to use it, why he should use, etc. We just want to help him to be able to look after his body and keep it clean, plus possibly minimise his acne since Sarah is squeezing it and making it look awful, which he then picks and makes it look even worse, and we're concerned he's going to end up with huge amounts of scaring on his face because of it. But after actually going out and buying it, I'm wondering if we should have just gone along with what Sarah wanted. \n\nSo Reddit, would we be the assholes by going against my stepson's mum and giving him skincare and deodorant even though she thinks he's too young for it?\n\nETA: My partner is going to show Sarah the products we have bought for Sam and talk her about how he (as a fellow male and Sam's father) feels its important for Sam to start using them now rather than later when puberty is in full swing.\n\n2nd ETA: Thankyou all for the comments, they're super helpful and my partner and I really appreciate everyone's honesty and feedback. My partner has put together a list of pointers from the comments to talk to Sarah about and will be making it very clear to her that he is also the parent and retains the right to have an input and make decisions about their son. You've all helped him to feel a lot more confident about standing up for himself in the co-parenting dynamic.", "created_utc": 1673493588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109ote1/wibta_for_giving_my_stepson_skin_care_and/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, it\u2019s better you say something about the body odor than a kid at school", "Nta my 8 yr old daughter has had the talk of her growing body already. She uses deodorant daily because she needs it! I'm not letting my daughter be known as the kid with the BO. Kids are brutal these days and you never live down being the stinky kid.", "Yes and no. You are and you aren\u2019t, depending on perspective. I can easily lean both ways on this one.\n\nHis father needs to take him to the doctor to get a diagnosis on WHY he\u2019s getting such bad pimples.\n\nDoes the kid know he needs to change his sheets and pillowcases weekly? Does the kid know how to shower properly? Does the kid shower often enough?\n\nFor the benefit of the child, NTA. He needs to learn", "I'm saying NTA... All it takes is for one kid in school to smell him and it will follow him throughout the rest of his school days... I've seen it happen. If he's getting acne and having odor issues, it's time.... Period. Good luck... She'll come around.", "NAH, but be careful. The kid smells because he's gearing up for puberty. He probably needs to bathe more than  he did even a year ago and isn't used to it yet. This would be a terrible time for his parents to have a fight about his body when he's probably just about to get self conscious about it. \n\nA toiletry bag and some deodorant at least sounds like a nice idea and will prevent him from ever being the stinky kid at school. Would he like a Bluetooth shower speaker? \n\n You can have pimples in middle school or you can smell a bit. Do both and those little monsters will eat you alive.", "NTA. As someone who got made fun of around that age for my acne (ended up having to get medication for mine), BO and body hair\u2026.

His dad can introduce the subject at the next visit but his mother sounds like a complete AH.", "NTA.\n\nOthers may comment that you need to respect his biological mother's boundaries but not if it's going to cause long term harm to the child.\n\nSqueezing blackheads and picking at the remnants will cause scars. This will impact his self confidence through the teens and early 20s. If a kid at school laughs at his BO that will impact his self confidence.\n\nYour partner needs to grow a set and as the father talk to his biological mother - child first always!", "NTA, especially if this all comes from his father. I do think that is important. Also important is that he learns appropriate hygiene. Children can be cruel to someone who smells less than pleasant. The acne should be dealt with also. If he is full of craters as an adult, he will regret it. At this stage it really is the parents' responsibility, as the kid doesn't have the full overview of all the possible consequences, and to suggest that it makes the kid grow up too quickly is bs.

Being hygienic is a part of growing up. That growing up when we're born. Tackling acne when it starts can make the difference in how he grows up looking. Nobody wants acne scars at any age. Learning to manage body odor to not offend his peers in his daily life is essential to prevent bullying and neglect, as well as developing self esteem.\n\nYou talked to Sarah out of respect first, but the only logical decision here is to let your partner deal with his son. He agrees with you.", "NTA. I would agree with other people about you needing to respect his mom\u2019s wishes if this didn\u2019t have to do with basic hygiene. It is frankly unfair of her to be refusing to do this for their kid. Heck, I started wearing deodorant when I was 8.

I get that being that age is a good time to learn and establish hygiene and self care habits and co parenting is tough. His father can take over with his mother and communicate but you can still teach him small things when hes in your home.

That can lead to infection and much more severe scarring, on top of being painful.", "NTA I think buying the stuff was a good thing and maybe his dad could have done that first.

It might be a good idea to have a conversation with Sam's mother and work together to help Sam with his skincare and hygiene in the most appropriate way.", "NTA\n\nSarah's desire not to see her baby grow up does not outweigh the reality of the situation. The kid needs to learn proper hygiene not just for his own sake, but for the poor classmates who will sit next to him. And please, please, talk to Sarah about not popping his acne! That's bad normally, but it's extra bad when someone else does it, as you're introducing their bacteria into your skin, not just your own. This kid could end up with some serious scars!\n\nAlso, if his face doesn't clear up soon, I recommend doing a little research on what products work best for his type of acne and oil level. Some types respond well to benzoyl peroxide, some salicylic acid, etc.", "NTA. The kid is entering puberty,and the mom may be in denial but it happens.She needs to stop popping his pimples. The picking he does could turn into a serious issue called dermatillomania/excoriation disorder which is a compulsive skin picking thing. \n\nHe needs to learn to care for his body and the mom has likely not had the puberty talk with him. His father should and good on you for buying him the products", "NTA- talk to Sam. Tell him that if you smell him, so do other people. My 13-year-old is on the spectrum and socially oblivious.

The idea that this could happen was enough for him to start doing it.", "Soft YTA but only if you were to do it because I think his parents need to have this discussion.

I would say best thing would be for your partner to speak to her and hopefully he can help her realise what's best for the kid.", "The wrong soap on his face can cause breakouts. Also not moisturizing after can as soap is drying.  A good balancing moisturizer is needed or else he'll produce more oil to compensate from the dryness soap causes.\n\n> I know that he doesn't use a pillow case at his mum's and the pillow never gets washed.\n\n*shudders* \n\nYour partner can offer to send him with a pillowcase he'll wash at home.", "Hygeine routine can have a big impact  on acne.", "A pillow that\u2019s literally never washed that he sleeps on 11/14 nights isn\u2019t great for skin and most likely a contributing factor, though.", "Depending on the relationship, at 11 there isn't inherently anything wrong with a parent being in the bathroom while the child bathes to check up on hygiene routine especially when there's reason for concern.\n\nAnd to reiterate I said depending on relationship- if the child isn't comfortable that does change things but without any other context, an 11yo having a trustedparent in the bathroom to give advice on pubescent hygeine isn't a bad idea.", "He is with his mum 11 out of 14 days a fortnight. He always has a fresh pillowcase and bed sheets when he is at our house, but she doesn't seem to care about the pillow. It is so disgusting but he's attached to it and she has just let it get more and more gross and won't buy him a new one either - my partner will be addressing this also!", "Nta I have a 14 yr old son. 11 is age appropriate for acne wash and deodorant. His parents are setting him up for failure. Also tell her to keep her dang hands off his face. Squeezing makes it worse.\n\nThis is a hygiene issue for sure, and if not addressed will get worse.", "I hate that some parents including mine could never just accept that hygiene standards are different and it\u2019s not \u2018too mature\u2019 at any age to want to take care of the body we live in. And now with a greater amount of younger children going through hormonal changes earlier, I believe things like skin care and even things as simple as smelling clean and washing off sweat allow kids to be more responsible and self aware of their bodies. \n\nI wish my mom was like you OP. I\u2019m pretty grateful my dad was able to intervene when I started to get acne\u2014my cousins had parents like my mom and would only do \u201chomeopathic\u201d treatments that didn\u2019t respond well to my actual needs. My mom was in denial for much of my life. \u2018I didn\u2019t need to use deodorant\u2019. (She lived in a tropical climate on an island in a provincial area, I grew up in an urban city\u2014San Francisco) live in \u2018I never shaved\u2019 (I guess I inherited all my body hair from my dad\u2014and she still forced me to go to a Catholic school with a skirt uniform so I was bullied relentlessly about hair on my legs). And frankly I did go through puberty much earlier than my peers. \n\nOP\u2014What a great way to approach the topic about your stepson even though this particular topic is about overstepping your boundaries as a stepparent.", "I second the bit about a dr appointment. Also dad should show him pictures of acne scars and tell him not to pick at them. I learned long ago to think of acne care as a biological war under the skin. It is the microbes you need to kill. Yes all those facial washes helped but what really helped was Olay toner with witch hazel and oil free facial lotion.", "My partner apparently never had acne and is a bit clueless, so he had no idea about the skin care stuff, but he has casually mentioned deodorant to Sam before and got a \"my says I don't need that\" in response, but he never followed up with it, but since it's recently become more of a prominent issue, he's taken the initiative to write a list of pointers from comments here to talk to Sarah about.", "NTA the stank that boys get when puberty hits is ripe. Now is the perfect time to start him on body and skin care so it becomes and unconscious thing he just does as self care.", "Just teach Sam how to wash himself. He probably doesn\u2019t know that he needs to scrub every single part of his body. I\u2019d also question the parents as they obviously haven\u2019t taught him this", "Even if the children are polite enough to not say anything, he will still be \"the one who stinks\" to others. Probably won't make him too popular with the girls, either. It's really not something you want to do to your child.\n\nNTA.", "And sometimes it takes a long time to find that magic solution. I\u2019m 43 now, and I STILL break out terribly if I don\u2019t use a cleanser with 10% benzoyl peroxide twice daily. I know that would kill some people\u2019s skin, but their routines would be just as hard on mine!", "That\u2019s just ridiculous. Sounds like he\u2019s an actual active involved parent too. They should talk about it yes but someone needs to talk to the kid. Also the conversation about deodorant and washing your face doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be about puberty, again this is basic hygiene. Good luck tho I know you are just looking out for the kid.", "If he's bringing the pillow with him then when he's playing during the day, pop it through the wash on a Heavy Duty cycle then pop it through the dryer with 2 tennis balls to fluff it up a bit; we do this with our standard pillows once every few weeks.", "Try dryer balls. Mine have cute koala faces on. They came in a pack of six and I've used only them for 3 years. No dryer sheets. So cute. And they pummel the clothes nicely. And pillows. \n\nSometimes one gets pulled out with the clothes and makes a rolling escape across the cellar floor!", "My son has a pillow that his great grandma made him when he was less than 2 years old. He is now almost 30 and just stopped using it. He was so attached to it, that not even his little girls could lay on it. LOL. He finally had to put it up. He said he was afraid of it falling apart. I still have a couple of his baby blankets, but he just clung to this one pillow.", "My youngest is 11m. He's been using deodorant for 6-8 months and gets a few pimples on his face now. The only \"too early\" happening here is that Sam is growing up too early for Sarah's comfort level. She needs to get her head out of the sand. NTA", "Since mom doesn't want him go grow up, I would not be surprised at all if she is knowingly ignoring his stench and allowing him to be in unhygienic conditions (like that filthy, disgusting pillow with no pillowcase) to encourage acne so that girls don't start to find her precious baby attractive. \n\nWho the fuck pops their child's zits???? This is not normal behavior at all. I suppose this level of ignorance is possible but it's hard to believe in 2023. I bet she doesn't even wish her hands first and this could cause lifelong scarring for him. \n\nNTA. Please help this child.", "NTA<-\nThat mom is clearly clinging onto her kid and babying him too much. He\u2019s obviously starting puberty and that\u2019s the perfect time to introduce him to those things because she is absolutely going to give him a ton of scars by messing with his acne like that. I mean what mom is fine with shielding her kid from BASIC HYGENE and skin care??? Thats insane", "That was my first thought too.  Mother doesn't want to face her baby boy is growing up.", "NTA. And as the son\u2019s father, your husband IS the best person to talk to his son about the situation. And to talk to him about why this is happening, perhaps arrange to see a dermatologist.", "NTA.\n\nAcne + body odor = puberty. Doesn't matter that he's 11. He's growing up while Sarah is trying to keep Sam a baby at the expense of his wellbeing. Kids are mean AF and if he's covered in acne and stinks, he is going to be bullied horribly.  Also, popping pimples can actually cause them to spread. She's making it worse. That mixed with his picking, yeah, hes looking at scars in the future.\n\nSarah needs to accept the fact that her baby isn't a baby anymore. Puberty is here and it's better to get him into the habit and routine of self care and personal hygeine now as opposed to later.", "NTA.  Please get a referral to a dermatologist.  They can also make recommendations and prevent acne scarring with early treatment. This will also make it harder for his Mom to argue.", "I started my girls on proactive at that age, and they are still on it. My oldest goes to a dermatologist as she has eczema, her dr told us that it\u2019s great for kids starting off on skin care. \nBut I would take him to a dermatologist just in case it\u2019s cystic acne, with that, that scars and his mother doesn\u2019t need to be popping his pimples,  potentially scaring his face. \nOh, you can get the proactive OTC and it\u2019s not \nExpensive pretty affordable. Just something to try if what you bought doesn\u2019t help. \nGood luck with your little man! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Sounds like mum doesn't want him to grow up. If she's that way about hygiene. I guess being called crater face and told you stink. Bulling at school will be OK with her. Sex Ed should be fun.", "NTA it may be different these days but either you have the conversation with him or he\u2019s going to end up reported to the school nurse by a teacher and she will have the \u201cthis is deodorant\u201d conversation. Happened to a few kids at my school growing up. Acne sometimes just can\u2019t be helped, hormonal and nothing to do with cleanliness, but you won\u2019t find out until there\u2019s a hygiene routine and then can pursue treatment from there.", "NTA- I was 5 when I started using anti perspirant deodorant. Each kids body is different, but when you can smell them then it is the time to talk to them about it. If he has that much acne he definitely needs to have a skin care routine.", "NTA. We had to start all this at 8 with our now 10 year old. His mom needs to understand his body is changing and she's failing her son by not addressing it. Dad needs to speak up now.", "You are so NTA. Please try to help this kid with his acne. Take him to a dermatologist as soon as possible. I struggled with acne as a kid, and my mom took me in every two weeks for acne surgery. I was prescribed acne meds and had a strong topical medication. Because my mom was so proactive at a young age I don\u2019t have any acne scars, and have a very youthful face for forty. I have seen some horrible acne scars and I think if a parent would have taken care of that early it would have made a huge difference for that person.", "NTA, my kid is 6 and needs deodorant \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Kids are developing earlier than before.", "Definitely take him to a Dr, I had acne but it turned out to be related to an autoimmune disease we didn't catch till I was well last puberty.", "She\u2019s also actively harming him to keep him \u201cyounger\u201d too. \n\nThe pimple popping is going to scar his face and could get infected. And his BO can cause him to lose friends or get bullied. She\u2019s prioritizing her wants over her son\u2019s needs."]}
