I couldn't stand her.\n\nI call her \"his ex\" to myself and others. He called her \"his friend\".\n\nWe're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. \n\nI've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.\n\nThe way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was \"important\". \n\nA couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me \"That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.\" \n\nWhen we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked \"Why would us getting married affect my friendships?\"\n\nI sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.\n\nHe'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. \n\nThe few times I brought it up he said \"We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.\"\n\nShe died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.\n\nHe was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him \"You don't think you're going, do you?\"\n\nMy argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his \"she's my friend\" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.\n\nHe was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's \"willing to burn this to the fucking ground\" while holding up his wedding band. \"Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.\"\n\nHim, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a \"ghoul\" for how I've reacted.\n\nI never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. \n\nAITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?", "created_utc": 1671474163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpz8tc/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_go_to_his_exs/", "score": 14299, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\n\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.\n\n---\n\nNevermind, I'm already sick of banning you all.

Fair enough.", "YTA- congrats on your impending divorce", "YTA\n\nThis is unbelievably cruel.\n\nAnd frankly cutting off your own nose. It\u2019s awful to say, but you just got what you wanted. You just had to be quiet for two more weeks.", "YTA \n\nWhen he divorces you, he probably won't have to explain his friendship with you to the next woman because, seriously... who'd want to stay friends with a woman who had treated you like this?", "*She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car.

YTA.\n\nI hope he gets a good divorce lawyer.", "If this is real, huge YTA\n\nNot because you didn't like her.\n\nYou're the AH because he is grieving the loss of someone important to him and you're trying to invalidate his feelings.", "YTA. You are jealous of a dead woman. A dead woman who was your husband's close friend and confidant for years, and you did know it right off the bat. You can't even give him a chance of closure? And it's not up to you to decide when he is done with mourning. Keep up being jealous of her, and you will find yourself to be his ex-wife as well.", "[removed]", "yta\u2026how are you even married to this man. you have no sense of empathy, and are very insensitive to him and his feelings.

If it was an issue 10 plus years ago. Why did you say yes to marriage. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t get to dictate how people grieve you ahole.", ">She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.\n\nSo one of his closest friends dies right in front of him  which is probably highly traumatic and your response \"about time\"?

Your husband has been straight up with you from the beginning about how important this woman was to him. Instead of making the decision back when you were dating to either accept that he has a close relationship with his ex or break up, you instead made the crappy decision to be resentful all this time. Horrible. \n\nYour husband lost his good friend, who also happens to be his ex, and you\u2019re relieved he lost her? You\u2019re trying to put a timeline on his grief and you want to prevent him from mourning someone who he had such a strong relationship with? Do you care about your husband\u2019s grief at all?  Do you respect your husband\u2019s feelings at all? And are you seriously jealous of a dead woman now? \n\nJust wow. Everyone is correct - you are heartless. I hope this is a wake up call for your husband and he can see what your true character is. YTA absolutely.", "[removed]", "What the hell is wrong with you?! Seriously?! He laid his cards on the table and gave you a chance to back out of the relationship if that was an issue you couldn't get over, so why didn't you in the beginning?! You seem so heartless. My ex husband is still my best friend and if he ever needs anything from me I will be there for him. My current fiance understands this and is the same with his ex. We love them like the family they are and not lovers or anything in intimate, but understand that though the romantic relationship didn't work there was still a platonic care that we didnt want to ruin. \nHe didn't hide this person from you, he told you flat out she was still important to him and allowed you to decide. You choose to continue the relationship and thought you had right to tell him who he could be friends with. I hope he wakes up and realizes how vile you are.", "YTA- if you weren't comfortable with their friendship why didn't you say anything and allow yourself to marry this man?? He made it clear she was important to him and he would choose her. You still decided to stay with him, even after he made his priorities clear. You spent your entire marriage hating her when maybe you know, you could have gotten to know her seeing as she's such an important part of of his life, instead of deciding to hate her simply because your husband was with her BEFORE HE EVEN MET YOU. \n\nAt this point your jealous of a dead woman, get the hell over yourself. She does not pose any threat to you and you're the one who is going to ruin your marriage for having this attitude and not wanting your husband to attend a close friends funeral because you feel threatened... by someone who is dead...", "YTA - if this is even real?! It feels kind of sketchy. A person telling her grieving husband to basically suck it up and than hoping for reassurance on the internet?", "Info: did you tell him you wouldn't have invited her to his funeral?\n\nCause if so you better prepare for your divorce, although I would do that anyway. Damn you are one of the most shittiest people I've ever seen in here, YTA and I feel so sorry for your husband.", "YTA, and you're being cruel. You need to get over your insecurity, I can understand it but if I was your husband I would be livid and wouldn't tolerate it. You don't get to decide this.", "YTA\n\nI could understand you having a problem with the relationship while she was alive. But, she's dead now, she's no longer a threat. Why not let your husband mourn a friend who obviously meant a lot to him? This just seems petty.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "So you should go ahead and just call the divorce lawyer cause you know he won't ever be \"done\" with her. He's gonna celebrate her life every year, he's gonna keep in touch and hang out with her widowed husband, and he's gonna have quite some time of mourning before he's okay. You don't sound like you understand any of this so I'd say you two are standing at the precipise, and you being you I don't see you both getting back to solid ground together sorry. YTA", "YTA, why are you seeing her as a threat even when she's dead? \n\nIf you won't let him he'll resent you and won't be an AH for that at all cause you deserve it.", "YTA, im not sure what you expected from this. this is such a cruel and heartless thing to do. do you hear yourself? you are jealous of a DEAD WOMAN. what is wrong with you ? seriously? are you that insecure?", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nMate enjoy your divorce \ud83d\ude02", "YTA.  And about to have an ex-husband by the sound of it.  He was upfront with you about this relationship from the start. You lied and said you could deal.  When your husband is deep in grief is not the time to come clean about your deception.  If you want to continue to be married to your husband you need to take a deep look at yourself and ask why you are jealous of a dead woman, and why your first thought wasn't to comfort your husband in his grief.", "YTA. You should have backed out when you had the chance now you gotta go through what sounds like with be a messy divorce.", "YTA.\n\nHe was very, very clear that if you had an issue with their friendship you should walk away. Y\u2019all shouldn\u2019t have gotten married, and with the way you\u2019re acting you probably won\u2019t be married much longer.", "Wow how is this even something you could write out and not come to the realization that YTA??? I think you need some therapy and a huge dose of reality. I really don\u2019t think you were ever ready for marriage and you definitely aren\u2019t now. He\u2019d be wise to leave you.", "YTA in that you didn\u2019t recognize this scenario is playing itself out naturally.  Had you just laid low until after the funeral.  You wouldn\u2019t see him go on his friend dates and what not.  She\u2019s not a main factor anymore until after the funeral and then likely it will be grave visits you\u2019ll have to deal with him making.\n\nTry to lay low and be supportive for the remainder of the funeral.", "YTA, should've packed it in and left if it was a problem.\n\nHis ex is dead and he was clear with you on what the situation was. Why did you keep asking expecting him to suddenly change his views on her? You've got some jealousy to work through that even her DEATH couldn't resolve.", "[removed]", "YTA.\n\nIf you have always felt this way about their friendship, you should have never married him.  \n\nJust because she passed doesn\u2019t mean she will automatically be deleted from his life.  If anything, he will always be mourning her.  If you can\u2019t accept this and be supportive, then you need to walk away.\n\nLet the man grieve!", "YTA. Good grief, stop already. Let the man go and grieve. It makes me ill to know you felt relief at her passing.", "Wow you are one heartless person. Yta. I hope this opens his eyes to the type of person you are and recognizes that he deserves better.", "This is the most monstrous take I\u2019ve seen on this sub in awhile, and this AITA, so that\u2019s really saying something.\n\nI don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re here asking, bc everyone in your life has already told you what you\u2019ll hear here. The lack of compassion you\u2019ve shown in your post honestly makes me wonder how you\u2019ve managed to hoodwink your husband to *ever* think you\u2019re a decent person.\n\nYTA, and I don\u2019t think you should be surprised if your husband goes to that funeral and doesn\u2019t come back.", "[removed]", "Is this fake? It's too callous to be real", "YTA.\n\nI get why you resented her, but for ffs, why did you put yourself in a situation and relationship with the guy who tell you straight that some other woman is his number one and you cannot compete? \n\nIt was disaster in the making and instead on saying \"no, thank you\" you've put yourself in years long path to resentment and hate. Well, she is dead, but he is not done with her and probably never will be. I'm trully sorry for you, cause you are not and won't be his number one.  \n\nDo you really want to be sour woman and the a-hole to a dead ex for the next 10 years?", "[removed]", "Holy wow, YTA. Enjoy your divorce.", "YTA.\n\nGood god this was awful to read. \n\nWhat you need to understand right now: You need to back down immediately, apologise profusely to your husband, support him in his grief (which will last years, not days), and never mention your petty resentment to him or anyone else ever again. If you do that, you'll probably still have a marriage.", "Yta, I've seen some terrible people on here. But you, you have taken the cake. \n\nYou had a chance to back out, but instead, you decided to go forth with the relationship, fine.\nYou can be distant when it come to the ex.\n\nThen you mentioned that they died after they had lunch, and you're relieved. \n\nThat is a horrific thing that you went to, gee, this person my husband likes died and I'm happy and that he can finally be done with them.", "YTA - This is a super shitty hill to die on.\n\nIt's over. Let him grieve. You've allowed it this long, this isn't the moment to be callous and petty.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have married him. Good or bad, this is who he is and you\u2019re not accepting of him. I get not liking a close relationship with another woman, but as he said, you had the choice to back out. Apparently you felt you could change him or had the right to make him change after the fact. Nobody does. \nNow she\u2019s dead and you are denying him closure and time to grieve. That\u2019s over the top. He\u2019s a person, not an accessory.", "yta. the guy is grieving his friend and now his wife isn\u2019t supporting him in the slightest. feeling relieved when your husband\u2019s friend dies is not a normal reaction and should have been a clue. if you truly were never going to accept them being friends, you shouldn\u2019t have married him", "YTA - Of course you are. She was still a friend. How insecure are you to still feel threatened by a dead woman? Please seek help, because your response is utterly lacking in empathy.", "YTA, for all the reasons everyone is saying here.  Furthermore, your husband was not only friends with his ex, but her husband (now widower).  I would expect that your husband's friendship with her husband will continue...  are you going to act like a 12-year-old AH about that, too?", "Yikes. I had to read this twice because I couldn\u2019t believe it. Like at this point let him go to the funeral. If having lunch together and seeing geeky movies was something that happened for over a decade, what\u2019s the harm at this point in going to support her husband? It would honestly be weird if he didn\u2019t go. This isn\u2019t some ex who he hasn\u2019t seen in twenty years. They saw each other the day she died. You\u2019re being beyond ridiculous.", "YTA.\n\nI feel so sorry for your husband. Both losing one of his best friends and also realizing how little you actually cares about him.", "you should have backed out when he gave you the ultimatum. now you\u2019re a ghoul and yes, absolutely yta", "YTA. And a not-so-smart one too. I agree that you should\u2019ve back out by now if it was such a problem, but after the funeral, you were literally in the clear.\n\nPlus, y\u2019know, kind of a fucked up thing to say to your husband who\u2019s grieving the loss of his friend\u2026", " I hope he does burn it to the ground. You are being heartless.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You're incredibly insecure and need to sort yourself out. Your husband is going to leave you if you don't get your shit together.", "Holy shit YTA!  Wow!", "YTA - and he truly sees you now. Congratulations", "[removed]", "YTA you should have just stayed quiet. She died, she\u2019s gone and he\u2019s all yours. You are headed for divorce now. Also whomever you marry, marry someone that will put you first. I personally think the relationship was a little to close, but you chose that.", "Ewwww that whole statement was gross. YTA. A big cruel one.", "YTA, but I think you already know that.\n\n\nYour husband is *grieving the loss of his best friend* and you\u2019re so insecure that you had the audacity to try to ban him from attending her funeral. \n\nYour jealousy and bitterness has turned into cruelty and, by the sounds of it, has put the final nail in the coffin of your marriage. And, honestly? At this point being served divorce papers is the perfect Christmas gift for you.\n\nEdit: a word", "[removed]", "YTA.   \nWhen she was alive, you had a point that as his wife, you had issues about an ex who was \"his best friend\".  \nShe's dead.

He's made it very clear that she's an important person to him. You've accepted thus far that he was going to have a relationship with her, but now you don't want him going to the funeral?

You've \"sucked it up\" for this long so you can suck it up for the woman's funeral.", "YTA - don\u2019t be surprised if he doesn\u2019t talk to you anytime soon.", "YTA, are you afraid he\u2019s going to cheat on you with her ghost?", "YTA - Your behavior is really weird here", "YTA.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t exist anymore??? What in the world? She was his friend. Maybe you didn\u2019t like it but she was. You chose to grin and bare it. Now she\u2019s gone and you just think poof, that\u2019s it? She no longer exists? That is not how people and human emotions work. Whatever feelings he had for her - even simply platonic ones - do not go away the second she dies. They never go away. Mourning is not having a cry, it\u2019s a complicated lengthy process that he has every right to go through.

Get mental help, you severely need it.", "\"My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore.

Stop bothering him with your unhinged insecurity.", "Holy \\[fornicating\\] \\[poop\\], yes YTA. What, do you think he's going to cheat on with her now that she's no longer among the living? Funerals are for the living to find some closure. Let him go to the funeral, let him swap some stories with mutual friends, and then the matter is done. Or . . . put your foot down, he'll ignore you anyway, and you'll wind up resenting each other and divorcing because you were jealous of a dead woman.", "YTA obviously, how can you be so jealous of a dead person?", "Yes YTA", "YTA.\n\nThis is his chance to say goodbye and reminisce in the company of others that knew her. He gets one chance to do this and you want to deny him that. You ARE a ghoul and an unsupportive partner.\n\nThat being said, you should have broken up with him when you had the chance. Seriously. He was never ready to move on and now, never will be.", "YTA - Congrats!  I am pretty sure you are in the running for the biggest AH of the year on this sub.... I mean if this post is even real.", "YTA, all the way. You are being profoundly cruel. Any death is devastating but the sudden nature of an aneurysm can leave people in a complete state of shock. He is going to be hurting big time right now and you\u2019re prioritising your fight with a LITERAL DEAD PERSON over your husband\u2019s emotional well-being. \n\nThe fight\u2019s over. You can\u2019t win him from her. He made that very clear from the start. Please just have the good graces to let him grieve as he needs to, including attending her funeral, seeing her family, whatever he needs.", "YTA! He gave you the chance and you denied it. He should leave your disgusting ass because he deserves better. To let your insecurities make you such a vile person makes the term asshole feels too polite. Now, not only is he grieving the loss of someone close to him but now he gets to deal with the fact his wife is a childish person and he gets to realize his marriage has been a complete lie.", "YTA. how can you be so jealous of a dead person? let him pay his fucking respects to someone that meant something to him.", "Yta\n\nShe's dead. Let him mourn her.\n\nIf you don't he will highly likely leave you. You are acting this way about a woman after she's dead.

YTA.", "YTA it was a wife once too, would you like him not go to yours if you died and he was re married ? \n\nI could see it being weird if they had an inappropriate relationship through out yours, or a HS girlfriend he hadnt talked to in 20+ years , but they did talk, they were married and she was his friend. And friends with her husband.\n\nI just wouldn't have married a guy who still saw his ex that much, it's a no go for me, but you knew and you knew about their friendship. She's dead now, she won't come steal him", "YTA he's given you the chance to leave if you are not ok with this, repeatedly.\n\nEven if we were to validate you and say you're right, it doesn't matter.

He was honest with you from the beginning- you lied to him and to yourself about your ability to handle her as his friend. Which was foolish and petty, based on your own description of their relationship.\nNow at a time in his life where he is the lowest, you kick him because you are relieved that she is gone?! WTF is wrong with you?  You must not enjoy being married because you have fast tracked your way to a divorce with the way you have handled this situation! And I frankly don\u2019t blame him one bit if that\u2019s the route he chooses. Regardless of your feelings about her, you showed zero empathy or sympathy for your own husband\u2019s feelings.", "You admit being relieved a person is dead and think you're NOT an asshole?", "YtA, you should be helping your spouse with his grief. Do you have a right to be upset that he lied bout the marriage?.  Yes. But that should have been handled/worked through years ago. Way before you married him. When the minister said to speak now or forever hold your peace, he/she/they were talking to you. \n\nWhat you're doing is wrong. He lost  his best friend.  It's not something he can shut the door on and be done with.. he is going to mourn for a very long time.  \n\nI don't know if your marriage can survive this.

In fact, probably one of the biggest I've seen on here. \n\nLet's break this down, your husband (if he doesn't leave you asap), knew her 12 years before he met you. Basic math shows they've been friends for about 20+years. It is ridiculous to say that he is not allowed to go.  Doesn't matter if it's an ex or not. \n\nAnd you say she died on the way to her car after meeting with him. That's traumatic af. You're the best wife for giving your husband a few DAYS to grieve a friend of over TWENTY years /s. \n\nGrow tf. You're not a damn teenager. Grow tf up. Your husband deserves someone who has zero empathy or awareness. He's a Saint for dealing with you for 10 years. Give him the best Christmas present and just leave him.

Maybe you should have gotten married to him.", "You\u2019re not letting him visit his friends funeral because you\u2019re jealous they use to date?

Yes, they had a past together, a long past. Yes, they were platonic friends. Yes, they were best friends, long before you and him were a couple. You were not part of his past, she was, both in a relationship and friendship. \n\nHow dare you have the audacity to prevent him from going to his best friend's funeral?!?

He even told you that you had your chance to leave. \n\nIt's absolutely disgusting that you're relieved AND to act like she shouldn't matter anymore now that she's passed. Congrats on nuking your marriage over a woman who's not even here anymore. You \"sucked it up\" just to show your husband and everyone else how truly awful you are. Expect the divorce within the next year.", "YTA get over yourself", "YTA majorly. I don\u2019t understand why a grown ass adult like yourself would feel so persistently insecure in your relationship that you would even HINT at making your spouse choose between you and a friend like that.

I couldn't stand her.\n\nI call her \"his ex\" to myself and others. He called her \"his friend\".\n\nWe're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. \n\nI've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.\n\nThe way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was \"important\". \n\nA couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me \"That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing.\" \n\nWhen we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked \"Why would us getting married affect my friendships?\"\n\nI sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.\n\nHe'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. \n\nThe few times I brought it up he said \"We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.\"\n\nShe died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.\n\nHe was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him \"You don't think you're going, do you?\"\n\nMy argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his \"she's my friend\" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.\n\nHe was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's \"willing to burn this to the fucking ground\" while holding up his wedding band. \"Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.\"\n\nHim, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a \"ghoul\" for how I've reacted.\n\nI never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. \n\nAITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My husband trusts us enough (as he should) to not feel jealous or weird about my friend and I hanging out with *or without* him. If my best friend died and my husband tried to stop me from attending his funeral and acted like I just needed to move on, I too would be furious. \n\nA few things you need to remember; yes they had previously had a romantic relationship, but that ended.

You weren\u2019t true to him. \n\n2 - You are so insecure that you think your husband will leave you for a relationship with his passed best friend ?! How f*cked up is that !\n\n3 - He lost his best friend, his platonic soulmate. He has his heart broken, his world is probably falling apart, and he must feel shitty as hell. Damn, I lost a friend I had known for three years and I am still not over it ! Grief takes time, love, support, and a person to talk to, a person that will actually listen. You are not this person. \n\n4 - He must feel so betrayed by you\u2026 you lied to him all these years, and this is probably the worst way for you to show your ugly side. \n\n5 - I wish him to divorce you as soon as he can, for his well-being and to teach you a good lesson about empathy. \n\n\nA person is dead. Can you not understand the emptiness is leaves behind ?! You are the most heartless person I have ever heard of, and I really hated every single one of your words. I felt so bad for your husband, because I feel like my feelings towards my passed friend are invalidated along your husband\u2019s. \n\nI cannot understand how, writing this, you did not realise how YTA. You are. Get over yourself, be selfless for once. Think about him, his feelings. And let him go if you can\u2019t. Because you are harmful.

Early in your relationship you were told of this close friendship and YOU were dishonest about your feelings by omission. \n\n2. Your H gave you the option of walking away if YOU were uncomfortable. You chose not to (anything to get that ring right) but have selfishly and miserably lived with resentment ever since.\n\n3.
