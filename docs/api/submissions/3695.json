She's always been a straight A student she's been misbehaving and I am at my wit's ends.\n\nShe's been skipping school, lying that she goes to her language classes, lying about going to her swimming practice, lying about going to her piano practice. I don't know where she's going and grounding doesn't help.\n\nI tried talking to her but her only solution is that she wants to quit all after school activities because she doesn't like them. That's not an option. She needs to keep her grades up to go to a good college, she needs to be on the swim team and she needs to practice her languages (she's doing French and Mandarin after school and her school requires her to do Latin and Spanish) and at least one instrument. They're not frivolous activities, they're to set her up for life and she needs to continue with them. One sport, one instrument and two languages is an appropriate amount for a 16 year old. She has already quit ballet, I think dropping one activity is more than enough to free up some of her time.\n\nThe nuclear option would be to drive her to all her activities and sit with her to make sure she attends them but I wanted to give her a chance and instead installed a tracking device on her car to find out where she's going and to make sure she's not getting into trouble and doing inappropriate stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching her movement and found that she skipped her French class and went to her friend's house. I was really angry, I drove to her friends' house to pick her up. The parents let me in and it turns out my daughter was fast asleep in her friend's room (her friend was doing homework). She claims, she's too tired with all her activities. I was enraged, she didn't come to me to talk but was deceptive and made me look like a bad parent in front of her friend's parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took away her phone, laptop, car keys, and all her privileges. She's only allowed devices in common areas now to make sure she's doing her homework. She seems to be fine with her privileges being taken away, she didn't fight but she's really angry at me for \"spying on her\" and has called my grandmother to cry about this. Of course, now the whole family of my ex is against me, calling me, trying to tell me how to raise my daughter. My daughter literally called me an asshole in my face because she's faced all the consequences she can so she had nothing to lose.\n\nAnd while I don't care about my ex's family's opinion, I was surprised to find out that my own sister shares their opinion. She thinks I was an asshole for spying on my daughter and I should never have done that. Now, I am wondering if I really am an asshole for using tracking device to make sure she's safe?\n\nEdit: everyone keeps accusing me of forcing her to do these activities so I just want to make it clear. That couldn't be further from the truth. She was given options, choices. She's picked those activities herself. She's not being forced to do piano when she wants to do drums, quite the contrary, she could've picked any instrument she wanted, she was encouraged to make those decisions herself.", "created_utc": 1669916159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9txem/aita_for_using_tracking_device_on_my_daughter_to/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't need to be on the swim team. She doesn't need to play the piano. All these things are *optional*. She's 16, very much old enough to be allowed a voice in how she spends her time and what hobbies she has.", "YTA\n\n> One sport, one instrument and two languages is an appropriate amount for a 16 year old.\n\nHow did you determine this? Especially when she's already taking two languages in school, which means she needs to learn four, at the same time, while not getting them all confused with one another. And she was doing two sports before, ballet and swim. You had her doing too much before, what makes this the right number now?\n\nShe has *told you* she needs to be doing less and that she's tired. You don't seem to care.", "Why are you forcing her to take so many classes she\u2019s clearly not interested in? She has been clearly telling you she doesn\u2019t want to go. She is tired. Stop forcing her to attend classes. Give her a break. Let her figure out who she is and what she likes.", "YTA - First, as her school requires her to take two languages, Latin and Spanish, she is not taking two languages as you say, but four languages.   \nYou need to acknowledge what she is actually doing.  What other classes is she taking?  How much homework is required for those classes?  How many hours a week does she swam (my high school swim practice was two hours long).  How many hours a week does she practice the piano? \n\nAnd she is skipping activities to sleep?!?  Is she able to get nine hours of sleep a night?  Recommendations are that high school students get eight to ten hours of sleep a night.  If you want her to attend a good college, you need to be more concerned with \"burn out\" than with checking all of the boxes for college.  Sit down with your daughter and LISTEN TO HER, do not interject your opinion.  Ask her 1) how she is feeling about school/life, 2) how she is feeling about her after school activities, 3) how SHE wants to spend her time, and 4) help her build a schedule around her passions and goals.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter is 16. She's old enough to decide what kind of after-school activities she wants to participate in. Swimming, piano, and four different language classes? I'd be napping on my friend's bed too. Forcing extraciricular activities on her against her will completely negates her feelings as a human being.\n\nAnd putting a tracking device in her car? That's helicopter parenting at it's finest.\n\nI can almost guarantee that your daughter is dreaming about turning 18, leaving you behind, and not having to deal with you anymore.

I was the  nonstop activities, sports + academic, and top grades kid. It burnt me out after high school and I was deeply unwell. You are setting her on the same path I went down and I assure you, the issues you are creating are very harmful.\n\nScale back. She needed a *nap.* You are deeply misguided about what will make her thrive into adulthood.", "I want to make sure I have this right.\n\nYour kid is so burnt out that she's sneaking out to sleep.

She is exhausted at best and you think that her getting some rest will ruin her future (or the future that you want her to have)", "YTA, this trouble making behavior you are so concerned about? That\u2019s burn out, you have ran your child into the ground with the amount of pressure you are putting on her. College is not worth your relationship with her, or her mental health.

You have 2 more years to try and fix this before you never hear from her again.", "YTA. Does she have time to breath? Because it sure doesn\u2019t sound like it. Get you head out of the sand, she is rebelling because she is not happy, she wants freedom and time to herself. 4 languages is ridiculous, and then to add swim and piano into it. You are setting your daughter to go NC, she is going to resent you forever. Hope you like being alone.", "You don't get it. You say she could chose \"any instrument she wanted\". She wants to make the choice \"no instrument\". She has to go to her friend's house to sleep because she's not getting enough rest and you don't believe her.\n\nYTA", "Listen, it sounds like YTA because you're making her go to all these activities which in YOUR opinion set her up for life. Did you even ask her what she thinks about all this?\n\nYOU'RE the one saying she needs to be on the swim team and if her school already requires her to do two languages (Spanish and Latin), then she's actually doing FOUR languages if you add the French and the Mandarin. Sure, there are health benefits to playing sports and playing a musical instrument can be very rewarding, if you actually like the instrument you're practicing, but this sounds excessive.\n\nLearning foreign languages can be fun and useful later on, but there's a limit to what a single person can do in a day. High school gets increasingly demanding as students go through it and you have her doing FOUR extracurricular activities that apparently YOU require. That's insane!\n\nYou're micromanaging her life and it would seem that you want to control every single breath she takes. How much time does she even have to do the mandatory homework her school requires? Have you even thought about how much of an overload she must be feeling right now? It is very telling that, when she lied about her whereabouts, she went to her friend's house to SLEEP, not to do drugs or have s3x or anything of the sort. She's exhausted! Have a heart, lady (or sir)!! Sit down and talk to her, starting with an apology for projecting your own expectations on her. Speak with a guidance counselor about how much homework the students get and let your daughter scale back on extracurriculars accordingly, so she has time to do all of her schoolwork, maybe an extracurricular or two that she WANTS to do, and hang out with friends, because social development is also important at this age.", "Literally just reading everything you make your daughter do made me tired. You are so far up the asshole tree I don't even know how you're gonna get down. \nYou're daughter is still a child you are completely and totally smothering her, ruining your relationship with her, and overworking her. \nWhat I suggest you do is set all your fears and ideas of what your daughter should be doing aside, sit down with your daughter and ask her what she wants to do with her life and you need to genuinely listen and not intterupt until she is finished then you can explain your motivations of why and just plain old talk to each other, make sure your kid is happy and ok because you are putting enormous ammounts of pressure on her and not really letting her enjoy life.\nI don't think it would be totally out of reason for your child to go to school and not have extracurriculars if that is what they want, learning one language is hard enough...I can't imagine how hard it would be to learn 2-4 at the same time.\n\nIf you keep going the way you're going you're going to lose your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. Not for the tracking thing but for ignoring your daughter\u2019s cries for help. Your daughter has too much on her plate and she\u2019s lashing out because of it. She\u2019s not a robot. I dated a guy whose parents treated him like this. He graduated form a top university with honors and instead of going to medical school like he wanted to, he went directly into the work force because he was sick of being overly programmed and couldn\u2019t bear subjecting himself to the rigorous routine of being a medical student after being forced to keep a rigorous routine all of his life. The problem was he didn\u2019t know what else to do with his life so she took a job he hated and has been trying to figure out his next chapter ever since. Don\u2019t let your daughter end up like that.", "What\u2019s your goal here?

Yes, you let her decide *what* activities, but was it you who forced her to *take* activities? Did she tell you she wanted to play the piano, or did you tell her she *has* to play an instrument, so pick one?", "YTA. And depending on your state, you may have also publicly admitted to a crime.", "YTA. Your daughter does not need to do all of that, especially if she doesn't want to. She is big enough to know what she wants and you are just being overly controlling. If you had checked her location for her safety, that would have been acceptable (to me), but checking on her just to see if she's attending French class is way too over the line. You are ruining you relationship with her.", "YTA. You *are* forcing to do these activities, despite your vigorous protestations that she has \"options.\" And as a result, your kid is overwhelmed and burned out.\n\nLet her have *true* options. Let her have the option of quitting some or all of those activities. She's going to her friend's house to *nap* for heaven's sake. Can you not see what that grueling schedule is doing to her?", "First off, YTA. Clearly.  \n\nThis poor girl is so overscheduled, I imagine she often doesn't get even remotely enough sleep.  There's no way to carry straight As in school, study four languages simultaneously, practice an instrument, and be involved in a competitive sport, while also getting 9 to 10 hours of sleep.  I'd guess she stays up late finishing homework, coursework for her additional language classes, and piano practice.  This is after the physical exhaustion of swim practice.  Now try to cram a social life in there somewhere, and of course her household chores.\n\nYou keep saying she has options.  I did too. The option I chose was to take stimulants throughout my last two years of high school and the start of college so I could get everything done and still be the perfect, perky, polite daughter that was required.  And as soon as I moved out, I dropped out of college, moved as far away as the country allowed, and stopped talking to my mother. \n\nTake a good long look at your daughter's day, OP.  Does it look something like this?\n\n  \n6:00a - up by now, possibly earlier if there is school work that must be finished before the day, or chores to complete before leaving for the day  \n6:30a - morning swim practice  \n8:00a - 3:00p - school, where she must maintain straight As  \n3:30p - 6:00p -afternoon swim practice  \n6:30p - extracurricular language class or piano class  \n8:00p - dinner, start homework  \n11:00p or later - bed\n\nBetcha it looks rather a lot like this, and her weekends are just as jam packed.  When does she get to socialize, or relax, or read something that isn't required by a class, or start to discover her own interests and personality?  The kid is ***exhausted*** and the only thing you can think of is how to control her even more tightly.", "Sounds a lot like YTA. You sure do have Clarissa's entire life planned out for her, don't you? That's not her life, that's your plan for a model child that you're trying to force her to occupy. No shit she's rebelling against that. And if you don't loosen up, this is only going to be the beginning. What you are seeing now is called burnout, and if the pressure doesn't get relieved, it gets worse. At the moment, she's just skipping some stuff but is still in a position from which she can recover. If this level of work continues, then it will all be for nothing because a burnout has no motivation. \n\nYou don't want to have raised a useless, mentally ill wreck, do you? That's what you're on the path to making.", "YTA. Forcing your kid to do all that is hurting both of you. I didn't do diddly fuck after school except anime club and I still got into college. Not everyone needs to go to Harvard.", "YTA.\n\n> She's been skipping school, lying that she goes to her language classes, lying about going to her swimming practice, lying about going to her piano practice.\n\nClearly she no longer trusts *you*.

Hope the sport+languages+instrument+grades+working her to exhaustion to the point she's hiding out at a friend's house to SLEEP was worth it!  \n\nOh and btw, you daughter didn't make you look bad in front of those other parents, YOU did", "So take a peek at my username. Yep, I understand the obsession with getting into a \u201cgood\u201d college. But you clearly need to back off and let her decide which activities to keep. Both ballet and swimming are very demanding, requiring 3 hours of practice 6 days a week. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to do both at a high level unless she started both at age 9 and really is only focused on 1 and just maintaining in the other. Neither is going to be the magic bullet getting her into college unless her swim times are fast enough that she qualifies as a swim team recruit or at least a capable walk-on or her dance technique is strong enough for her to audition and be admitted as a dance major, or she has the kinds of connections and training (somewhere like SAB or SFB?) that stand out enough in a Harvard application pile to be one of the 4-5 ballerinas they accept each year for the campus company. (And for those spots the competition is crazy fierce because most ballet families have money and care a lot about college) The same goes for an instrument - is she good enough at piano to audition and get in as a piano major, or to participate in a college ensemble? Would she want to? If she doesn\u2019t want to do it now, I doubt she\u2019ll want to commit to 4 more years of that in college. She also doesn\u2019t need 4 languages unless she is trying to become a UN translator or something. Two through school is enough. Better to pick one and spend the summer studying abroad experiencing that culture. \n\nAt this age it\u2019s best for her to pick what she is most passionate about and drop some of the other stuff. Sleep is pretty important for teens and if she has 6 am swim practice, plus all those activities, plus homework from AP classes she may not be getting enough. It sounds like you are trying to ensure she is \u201cwell rounded,\u201d but it\u2019s a \u201cspike\u201d that makes you stand out in admissions. And that\u2019s not something she has time to build with all those things you have her in. She should choose what she loves, and you should give her maximum support in doing well at those. Best if it\u2019s something she can actually major (or double major) in. She needs to get deeply involved in 1 or 2 areas. And what about school clubs like debate or school news or DECA? Surely there must be something she\u2019d like to try that fits with her top interests but doesn\u2019t have time for with all those outside lessons. That could build on and round out her actual interests. Which may not involve a sport, language or instrument. None of those will be the best use of time now for someone who wants to major in biology or computer science or business.  \n\nI actually do have 2 kids who were pretty successful in the college admissions game. And it IS a game with random results that don\u2019t always make sense or seem fair. They were successful because they picked their own activities, things they were super passionate about and enjoyed pouring time into. That was reflected in their achievements and the time they devoted. One of them actually was a ballet dancer who auditioned for and got into some top college dance programs but opted to go to a school known more for academics, eventually switching majors from dance to something more \u201cpractical.\u201d But a decade later she is still dancing. It\u2019s who she is. She does not have any resentment or regret over giving up every Friday night in HS for rehearsals or skipping sleep to study for exams after daily classes an hour drive away. She is thrilled to be doing that again now, as the teacher. She took as many AP classes as she could on the side with good grades, but she barely had 3 years of one foreign language and 2 of science. There was no time for swimming or instruments, and she left school an hour early so she had fewer academic classes. Her dancing, artistic abilities and the dedication, passion, and humor in her essays got her into multiple top 30 schools. Her sister had decided on a career path as a HS freshman and every activity she did she picked either because of its relationship to that or because it would help empower young women, her other passion. She has built those into twin spikes and has been accepted to several of the top programs in the world for her field, both as an undergraduate and now grad school. The things she did in HS gave her a solid base to build on, along with a lot of stress. I did drive both girls around to many of their activities - not to check on them but as moral support and so they could use those free minutes to study/dress/snack/relax and spend a little time with me. I regularly asked if they wanted to skip an event or cut back on something and was supportive in the rare cases they did. Nothing they have faced in adult life was as hard as their high school. When I\u2019ve asked my younger one if she regrets those nights where she cried in the shower and barely slept, she claims she does not. It was HER CHOICE to do all those activities and classes, and the confidence she built forging her path shaped her into an amazing woman. \n\nI on the other hand have serious regrets. I wish I had not put them in a competitive high school where they worked so hard. I wish I had encouraged them to run a little less hard and sleep more. I wish I\u2019d let them know it was ok to sleep down and that you can go to college slower/later if you need to. I see now that even \u201ctop\u201d colleges have their flaws; not everything about them is \u201cbetter\u201d and they are only a needed career springboard for careers on Wall Street, top tier management consulting or maybe academia. Those were my fields\u2026 but my girls had no interest in them. Any decent college would have been good enough to get into most other careers. They don\u2019t regret going to the colleges they did, but would be the first to tell you it\u2019s maybe not worth sacrificing a lot of money or blood, sweat and tears.\n\nYTA, not so much for the tracking when you were worried, but for having unhealthy expectations for your daughter and not listening to her and letting her take the lead in deciding what to do with her after school activities. You clearly didn\u2019t listen well enough that she felt she could tell you what\u2019s going on. You refuse to accept her making changes now. She didn\u2019t embarrass you when you barged into her friends\u2019 house, you embarrassed yourself AND her. I promise her friends think you are crazy and probably cruel. Even though you may have good intentions you are doing this all wrong. You need to work on being her support team, not her \u201cboss.\u201d\n\nYou have 2 years to repair your relationship and help her get started on a career path SHE wants at a college that works FOR HER. I suggest you apologize, hand back her stuff, and make a new plan that doesn\u2019t involve 4 languages, an instrument and 2 sports. Maybe just working in a greenhouse and taking summer college biology. Or Model UN + 1 language and study abroad. Let her pick the pieces and support her in building a spike. Give her December off to rest and rethink what makes sense, and support her in a new plan in the New Year. Let her set her own goals and priorities and don\u2019t set conditions about how much she needs to do. Best to go deeper into her real passions. And take the tracker off.

She's always been a straight A student she's been misbehaving and I am at my wit's ends.\n\nShe's been skipping school, lying that she goes to her language classes, lying about going to her swimming practice, lying about going to her piano practice. I don't know where she's going and grounding doesn't help.  \n\n\nI tried talking to her but her only solution is that she wants to quit all after school activities because she doesn't like them. That's not an option. She needs to keep her grades up to go to a good college, she needs to be on the swim team and she needs to practice her languages (she's doing French and Mandarin after school and her school requires her to do Latin and Spanish) and at least one instrument. They're not frivolous activities, they're to set her up for life and she needs to continue with them. One sport, one instrument and two languages is an appropriate amount for a 16 year old. She has already quit ballet, I think dropping one activity is more than enough to free up some of her time.\n\nThe nuclear option would be to drive her to all her activities and sit with her to make sure she attends them but I wanted to give her a chance and instead installed a tracking device on her car to find out where she's going and to make sure she's not getting into trouble and doing inappropriate stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching her movement and found that she skipped her French class and went to her friend's house. I was really angry, I drove to her friends' house to pick her up. The parents let me in and it turns out my daughter was fast asleep in her friend's room (her friend was doing homework). She claims, she's too tired with all her activities. I was enraged, she didn't come to me to talk but was deceptive and made me look like a bad parent in front of her friend's parents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took away her phone, laptop, car keys, and all her privileges. She's only allowed devices in common areas now to make sure she's doing her homework. She seems to be fine with her privileges being taken away, she didn't fight but she's really angry at me for \"spying on her\" and has called my grandmother to cry about this. Of course, now the whole family of my ex is against me, calling me, trying to tell me how to raise my daughter. My daughter literally called me an asshole in my face because she's faced all the consequences she can so she had nothing to lose.\n\nAnd while I don't care about my ex's family's opinion, I was surprised to find out that my own sister shares their opinion. She thinks I was an asshole for spying on my daughter and I should never have done that. Now, I am wondering if I really am an asshole for using tracking device to make sure she's safe?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm sure you mean well, but that's a lot for one person to handle. Give your kid a break!

Why does she need two extra languages? Kid\u2019s interests change all the time. Part of growing up is figuring out who we are and what we like. You aren\u2019t letting her do that. You are imposing your will and desires on her. This often doesn\u2019t end well for the parent.\n\nAs for the spying, you are wrong if you didn\u2019t have a discussion with her beforehand. My kids all had a tracking app on their phones, but we were very upfront with them about it. They knew it was part of the rules of us supplying a phone and there were no complaints. Transparency and communication are the keys to a healthy relationship. You broke that trust.", "YTA. \n\nNot only is your daughter going through a rough development age, there has been an implementation of work to be done on top of what she is already doing for school. Yeah a good college is important, not at the expense of your daughter\u2019s well being. Did you stop and think of why she was sleeping when you picked her up? Her brain is literally still in development and she\u2019s literally tired of doing school work and something else. Honestly it sounds like this is your ego driving, you should be happy that she had been a straight A student. Looks like you\u2019re ruining that relationship.", "YTA- let her quit some classes. That\u2019s way too much for someone. If you think you\u2019re not forcing too much on your child, why can\u2019t she quit, why must she resort to running away in order to get some sleep in? You should listen to the family around you.", "YTA.  She really shouldn't be lying to you, but you're not hearing her when she has told you the truth.  She has said she doesn't want to do these things.  It really seems like she's overwhelmed. Two languages seems excessive to learn.  One, fine.  If the school requires two, I guess she's stuck.  She doesn't need to be on a sport and play an instrument.  Compromise and let her pick which one she'd rather.  Work with her.  It should tell you something that she no longer cares if you take her electronics away which is probably like a lifeline to most people.  She sounds exhausted and you refuse to listen.", "YTA - four languages, an instrument, and a sport? WHY??? Of course she\u2019s tired. She\u2019s burnt out. She doesn\u2019t have time to not be constantly on the go. Forcing her to do all of these things is only going to strain your relationship. Also, if the only thing you care about is where she goes to school, you should know that a lot of colleges would much prefer to see a kid very committed to ONE thing instead of pretty committed to everything. Let your kid be a kid for gods sake. Stop being a helicopter parent that wants to mold their child into the golden daughter they want. You say she has a choice but if she had to choose WHICH instrument instead of IF she played an instrument, that\u2019s not a choice. Give her free time. She\u2019s exhausted and possibly depressed and you are going to push her away. It\u2019s good to have after school activities but one or two is PLENTY. OP, you need to wake up.

How hungry you were all the time, how tired, how impatient you were to just go home and relax? Your daughter wants a break. Sit down with her, talk to her why she's feeling the way she is. *Let her drop some classes*. Leisure time is *required* to be healthy.

No one is going to be impressed if she can say \"hello\" and \"where's the bathroom\" in 4 languages, but isn't really fluent in any of them.\n\nOh, and one more time for the record: YTA.  Stop mentally abusing your kid.", "YTA. That\u2019s a LOT for a kid. That\u2019s a lot for an adult. Have you attempted to align her activities with her interests? Have you tried to understand her, or do you just punish?\n\nAnyway, the crux of the issue is that your style of parenting isn\u2019t working. Your daughter didn\u2019t make you look like a bad parent, you did that. Not saying you\u2019re a bad person. I\u2019m saying your parenting is actively failing this child, who clearly doesn\u2019t trust you, and it\u2019s not hard to sus out why. The harder you push, the more you\u2019re upping the odds she spends her whole young adulthood self sabotaging just to spite you. Which at some point is on her - but right now, she\u2019s a kid.
