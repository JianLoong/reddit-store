Fed is best. Meet with your ob/gyn alone. Explain that you've had a traumatic history and you're going to need their support in preventing family members and the health care team from traumatizing you. A lot of standard care involves mom's breast area so you'll need to be prepared for what they'll suggest and  be very explicit about declining it.\n\n1) Ask them to provide letter you will share with your medical team and family explaining your 100% bottle feeding plan. Hospitals vary but many routinely send breastfeeding coaches or don't automatically provide formula these days. Make sure your labor and delivery nursing team understands that you'll need support with bottle feeding.\n\n2) A clear statement on your birth plan that you aren't to be offered breastfeeding coaching, the birthing team isn't to offer to place the baby on your chest after birth and no one is to touch your breasts. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives - holding the baby nestled between your arm and body after birth, etc...\n\n3) A referral to a therapist who specializes in trauma based care and anxiety treatment. While the history of your anxiety isn't in dispute, your future health will be more secure if you can find someone to work with to increase your tolerance for medical care around your breasts. (Eg your milk will come in shortly after birth and you'll want to have a care plan in place for addressing any issues that come up while the tenderness is subsiding, if you run into blocked milk ducts or need future care like mammograms.) \n\n4) Ask the therapist to help you figure out the best way to hold and carry the baby, including practicing with a doll or stuffed animal. Many local baby supply stores offer a variety of baby slings and carriers that you can try on in the store.\n\n5) Ask the therapist for help finding a couples or family counselor to address your partner's anxiety and his relationship with his mother..", "NTA.

He will care for the baby while you pump, 6 times a day for 30 mins, the first few weeks. He will not disturb you. He will help clean and sterilise bottles and pumping equipment. He will bottle feed breastmilk. He doesn't want to do this? Though luck. Breastfeeding is a joint parent thing. It is ridiculously hard and time consuming. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.

You might form a bond of trust with your child and it will help you to begin a new path of healing.\n\nI have severe OCD and a lifelong aversion to touch.  When I had my babies, I had to do desensitizing work with my therapist so that my babies touching me became a normal and happy thing, and it definitely did.

It\u2019s a bit easier and perhaps better for it to be the gestational parent, because the oxytocin produced by being close with the baby helps to start the womb to contract back down, which helps slow the bleeding, as well as things like the baby being calmer when they recognise your scent as familiar, but there\u2019s no reason why a non-gestational parent/birth partner can\u2019t do it - dads, other mums, adoptive parents etc are all still pretty good at it.

Formula is just as good for baby\u2019s long-term health. There is lots of great information for this, but I liked how this was handled in Cribsheet (the audiobook is surprisingly good). \nThe benefits of breastfeeding are mostly from the skin to skin contact. This generally means shirtless time with the baby for both caregivers. During this time, even if bottle feeding exclusively, a hungry baby will likely be rooting around for mom\u2019s breasts. This means basically chicken pecking on your chest or attempting to grab a nipple with their hand/mouth. OP can probably wear a padded bra at this time to minimize the sensation, but depending on the trauma, that might not be enough. \n\nYou mentioned that no touching the breast was something you discussed with a therapist. Do you still have access to talk to them about this? The baby just isn\u2019t going to respect your personal autonomy and boundaries (they don\u2019t even understand that you\u2019re separate people for ~4 mo). \n\nPerhaps your trauma response won\u2019t be activated by your baby since they are a part of you and you will have so many hormones rewiring your brain to love him/her.  Maybe this completely non-sexual form of touch will just be *different* once the baby is here, but don\u2019t push yourself. \n\nDon\u2019t let someone break down your boundaries. If it were me, having someone else touch me in a way I don\u2019t want would make it worse. Then I\u2019d get too freaked out and anxious about it that the baby touching me would be a trigger. Just try to get into a headspace of loving this little baby and looking forward to snuggling him/her. When baby comes, maybe it will feel ok for him to touch you, maybe it won\u2019t and you\u2019ll figure it out. \nFor me, the sensation of my baby breastfeeding is entirely different than any other breast touch, so maybe it will be for you too. \n\nCommunicate with your spouse about your boundaries (now and after you meet baby and a few weeks in as everything changes so fast). Use scientific sources when considering if \u201cbreast is best\u201d. (Spoiler: breast is great because of skin to skin and some small immediate benefits like comfort and immunity boots. Formula is just as good nutritionally and has no negative effects once you find one your baby likes.

Sometimes that happens.", "The cabbage thing was in my official release paperwork from the hospital.", "I misread the 16 MONTHS and almost fainted.", "I think they\u2019re referring to more *specialized* therapy, beyond just a regular counselor or psychologist. \n\nWhat they likely mean is something closer to a physical therapist than a standard behavioral counselor. Especially since this issue has real medical ramifications.\n\nSomething akin to a professional doula, midwife, or qualified nurse would be the ideal. Someone who is trained to take the mother\u2019s mental health into account and tailor everything to both her physical, mental, *and* emotional needs.", "Thank you. I gave birth a bit over a year ago and literally no one touched me without permission. I made it clear when I was taken in that this would be necessary. All my nurses were wonderful (I did have a bit of an issue with the doctor I was assigned and went through the process of reporting that). \n\nI will never accept the answer to a problem is to just accept assault. These people are acting like PTSD is just nbd.", "That's what the couple claimed.  It was just the husband and wife both times.  She hired a midwife for the first birth but they fired her because they didn't agree with her. She chose not to get any prenatal care either after she left the midwife.  She didn't even hire a midwife the second time.  The two kids choose their bedtimes and haven't been to a doctor.  She plans to homeschool.  I have friends who do a fabulous job of homeschooling but I doubt she will.\n\nAs a woman who had to have emergency C-sections for both pregnancies and had a baby who was breech until the last minute, I think a wild birth is a terrible idea.", "I was thinking it's like those people that wanted to give birth with dolphins or something.", "Some of them, yeah. But the comment *I actually responded to* went way beyond that. That was why my reaction was where it was. I was reading along and ..... \\*snap.\\*\n\n\"It's a great thing to work on... and you'll be a happier person in the long run?!\" What the actual *fuck?* Read that in the context of the OP and it's an objectively awful thing to say. She's actively projecting that she doesn't think OP has the brains to differentiate between deep, intractable trauma (which she describes with a high degree of self-knowledge and anguish) and failure to \"work on herself.\"", "She cannot even touch her own breasts.\n\nDo you really think she needs to be *told* to get more intensive therapy?\n\nI completely agree that she needs to be prepared for the inevitable reality of things she won't be able to control, like the baby touching. I'd be hopeful, in her case, that it does turn out to be tolerable. \n\nAt the same time, I hope she and her therapist are talking about ways to minimize that sensory input against the possibility that it's too much for her to handle sometimes, such as a thick soft blanket that can be placed between her and the baby while she's holding her. \n\nDespite the harm that was done to her, **OP is clearly a valiant and resourceful person** \\-- she was able to marry and conceive a child. But people who have been hurt this way are intensely vulnerable to self-doubt and shame. Now she's being told that because she's got cargo, she loses the ability to hold on to those coping strategies or the right to establish the boundaries she needs to protect herself.", "I can only imagine how hard it must be to have her husband turn on her. \n\nPregnancy takes some men that way - they go from supportive and nurturing of her needs, to discarding boundaries in favor of the baby. OP, I really hope he comes to his senses and remembers you're the woman he loves, not a baby cartridge.", "No, we're not acting like it's nbd. But being emotionally equipped to handle this is important. PTSD is a terrible and debilitating condition. She is becoming a parent which is drastically increasing her likelihood of being triggered. You're failing to see her point, she can't handle being touched at all, it has nothing to do with giving consent first. My breasts were inadvertently brushed against dozens of times during person to person transfers of my child that first week or so and it was very uncomfortable for me on a purely social level. I can't imagine how badly someone with genuine ptsd or trauma will feel about that contact, but it will be rough and she will be going through a huge physical/emotiinal trauma at the same time. Her nerves will be absolutely fried and her support people suck. A good therapist will help her mentally prepare for handling these moments and possibly help in other ways as baby to naked chest contact is considered the gold standard of first moments bonding between mom and baby- for the sake of the baby & mom both. It would be helpful if a therapist could help her develop a technique to hold baby differently as cradling a child in your arms basically guarantees that the babies head will be touching mothers breast.", "Oh no! I was lucky I was pregnant during 2020. So I didn't have to deal with anybody."]}
