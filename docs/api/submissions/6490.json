Fed is best. Meet with your ob/gyn alone. Explain that you've had a traumatic history and you're going to need their support in preventing family members and the health care team from traumatizing you. A lot of standard care involves mom's breast area so you'll need to be prepared for what they'll suggest and  be very explicit about declining it.\n\n1) Ask them to provide letter you will share with your medical team and family explaining your 100% bottle feeding plan. Hospitals vary but many routinely send breastfeeding coaches or don't automatically provide formula these days. Make sure your labor and delivery nursing team understands that you'll need support with bottle feeding.\n\n2) A clear statement on your birth plan that you aren't to be offered breastfeeding coaching, the birthing team isn't to offer to place the baby on your chest after birth and no one is to touch your breasts. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives - holding the baby nestled between your arm and body after birth, etc...\n\n3) A referral to a therapist who specializes in trauma based care and anxiety treatment. While the history of your anxiety isn't in dispute, your future health will be more secure if you can find someone to work with to increase your tolerance for medical care around your breasts. (Eg your milk will come in shortly after birth and you'll want to have a care plan in place for addressing any issues that come up while the tenderness is subsiding, if you run into blocked milk ducts or need future care like mammograms.) \n\n4) Ask the therapist to help you figure out the best way to hold and carry the baby, including practicing with a doll or stuffed animal. Many local baby supply stores offer a variety of baby slings and carriers that you can try on in the store.\n\n5) Ask the therapist for help finding a couples or family counselor to address your partner's anxiety and his relationship with his mother..", "NTA.

He will care for the baby while you pump, 6 times a day for 30 mins, the first few weeks. He will not disturb you. He will help clean and sterilise bottles and pumping equipment. He will bottle feed breastmilk. He doesn't want to do this? Though luck. Breastfeeding is a joint parent thing. It is ridiculously hard and time consuming. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.

Your body, you get to decide. Tell everyone their opinion doesn't count anymore.  Both my babies were bottle-fed. Oldest because he was 6 weeks premature and had a poor sucking instinct.

It was a relief when I started him on the bottle.  Youngest son was simply not interested no matter how hard I tried. I got over it pretty quickly, and he thrived being bottle fed.

After you give birth your breasts will swell and be painful, minimize expressing as much as possible and if you absolutely need to do it by hand (this does not increase risk of infection per most recent medical studies).

The baby is going to touch your breasts.  As your baby grows into a toddler, they will touch your breasts.  They will not understand that you don't want them to.  They are not capable of doing that.  Holding your baby to bottle feed will result in them brushing up against your breasts (through clothing) holding a baby to burp them will result in their torso or legs touching your breasts.  You cannot support a newborn's head properly while holding them away from your body for very long.\n\nMy toddler regularly pulls my husband's chest hair and has since he was a newborn.  He doesn't know any better.

The worst part? After i hit my absolute breaking point and said \"no more, not one more time\", it took another week after that to wean off the pump.
