Fed is best. Meet with your ob/gyn alone. Explain that you've had a traumatic history and you're going to need their support in preventing family members and the health care team from traumatizing you. A lot of standard care involves mom's breast area so you'll need to be prepared for what they'll suggest and  be very explicit about declining it.\n\n1) Ask them to provide letter you will share with your medical team and family explaining your 100% bottle feeding plan. Hospitals vary but many routinely send breastfeeding coaches or don't automatically provide formula these days. Make sure your labor and delivery nursing team understands that you'll need support with bottle feeding.\n\n2) A clear statement on your birth plan that you aren't to be offered breastfeeding coaching, the birthing team isn't to offer to place the baby on your chest after birth and no one is to touch your breasts. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives - holding the baby nestled between your arm and body after birth, etc...\n\n3) A referral to a therapist who specializes in trauma based care and anxiety treatment. While the history of your anxiety isn't in dispute, your future health will be more secure if you can find someone to work with to increase your tolerance for medical care around your breasts. (Eg your milk will come in shortly after birth and you'll want to have a care plan in place for addressing any issues that come up while the tenderness is subsiding, if you run into blocked milk ducts or need future care like mammograms.) \n\n4) Ask the therapist to help you figure out the best way to hold and carry the baby, including practicing with a doll or stuffed animal. Many local baby supply stores offer a variety of baby slings and carriers that you can try on in the store.\n\n5) Ask the therapist for help finding a couples or family counselor to address your partner's anxiety and his relationship with his mother..", "NTA.

He will care for the baby while you pump, 6 times a day for 30 mins, the first few weeks. He will not disturb you. He will help clean and sterilise bottles and pumping equipment. He will bottle feed breastmilk. He doesn't want to do this? Though luck. Breastfeeding is a joint parent thing. It is ridiculously hard and time consuming. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.

This doesn't need armchair psychologists deciding that giving you new fresh trauma sounds like a really good idea, you need a trained and licensed professional who specializes in body/sexual trauma.\n\n(edit, typo)", "Agree that you need to find a therapist to help with your trauma, especially because childbirth and postpartum can be traumatic on their own and can exacerbate past trauma. If you haven't heard of EMDR therapy, look it up. If you're in the US see if you can find a licensed therapist that practices EMDR. It's shockingly good at helping your brain/body to process trauma, new and old.", "So she\u2019s never ever going to have the baby on her chest? What about burping the baby? And what about when the baby is a clingy toddler trying to hug and climb all over mommy? Baby backpack only solves like 10% of the problem.", "Don\u2019t be pedantic. There might be some times you won\u2019t have to have a baby touching your chest but there definitely will be times it will be impossible to avoid. OP definitely needs to get back into therapy on this issue.", "Thanks for clarifying. Didn\u2019t know how it worked.", "Yeah that's an another level of crazy.  Like run-and-don't-look-back level.", "Agree with this bc at some point there will be the all important breast exams and mammograms. \n\nSo sorry for your problems. I had some issues too. When I was pregnant eons ago (50 years lol) my MIL pushed for natural childbirth, unheard of at that time. Also I couldn\u2019t breast feed, problems with wide nipples. But the one huge relief was 50 years ago, there wasn\u2019t this pressure on new moms that you are some how **less than** if you don\u2019t breastfeed. Please try to remember that you are never **less than** anyone else. We\u2019re all just doing the best we can to get through the day happy and healthy. No need for extra drama.", "This!!!", "Agreed Mastitis is no joke.  A friend had a bad infection and ended up needing surgery to remove part of the infection. Then antibiotics and she somehow kept being able to breastfeed after.", "They said there is no way to carry a baby not on your chest. \n\nI corrected them. \n\n\nWhere did you get confused?", "Didn't say she didn't. But the person I responded to did say there is *no way* to carry a baby not on the chest. They are demonstrably incorrect. I'm not being pedantic; I'm being accurate.", "I don\u2019t think pedantic means what you think it means lmao", "I know what it means, I just don't think it applies to literally every situation in which a person is corrected when they have made an incorrect statement."]}
