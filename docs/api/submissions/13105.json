But as a gay woman myself let me provide some context for what might be going on with this girl. \n\nComing to terms with sexuality can be such a hard experience to go through. Especially if you went to religious schools as a kid and had it branded into your brain from a very young and impressionable age that being anything but heterosexual was a sign of some sort of moral or spiritual corruption or deficiency of your character. \n\nThe self hatred for something you cant change about yourself, the additional struggles it creates as you\u2019re going through adolescence and trying to discover who you are as a person, can be absolutely soul destroying. \n\nWhen you finally manage to get the stage where you accept and embrace this element of yourself after so much pain, it\u2019s such a euphoric and liberating experience that for many people, they start to wrap their whole identities around this truth about themselves that they suffered so much for. Unfortunately this often comes at the cost of neglecting to develop and work on other areas of their personality and making their sexuality the personality in and of itself rather than just a piece of the puzzle that is their identity as a person. When this occurs, it often manifests in people who find ways to bring their sexuality into literally every sentence of every conversation they have and it can be extremely annoying for the people around them. \n\nThey\u2019re at the stage where they think they\u2019ve accepted themselves and worked through all their issues so they don\u2019t realise this is an after effect of the trauma they suffered on their journey to self acceptance. \n\nAgain, OP. You are NTA. But I just wanted to provide some context that it\u2019s very possible this girl wasn\u2019t doing this just to be a pain in the ass.

I'd be annoying in proclaiming otherwise too at that point. \n\nWhat a strange activity.", "Most gay people I know spend a considerable amount of time talking about being gay. I sometimes think it\u2019s odd how much they discuss their sexuality, but I get it. For so very long they were unable to be their authentic selves without fear and the lgbq+ community is finally able to fly their flag so to speak. It\u2019s just sometimes it gets to be a bit much. \n\nMy opinion is the girl was immature and seeking attention for being \u201cdifferent\u201d.", "Exactly. So why is it that when you talk about your wife, it's just you making conversation but I bring up my partner it's me pushing a agenda?", "I don't know what this means. Is that good? Bad?", "I knew a girl who used to bring up being gay constantly even if it wasn\u2019t relevant to the topic being discussed. \nShe shoehorned it into every conversation and even started introducing herself to people as \n\u201cHi I\u2019m Sarah, I\u2019m a lesbian\u201d\nWhen it failed to get a reaction she got pride tattoos and a tattoo saying \u201cI don\u2019t just like women I love them!\u201d\nShe\u2019s not the only gay person I know who brought it up more then necessary and I agree sometimes it does just get too much! \nIt annoys me though when people constantly draw attention to their sexuality and when they don\u2019t get a reaction they claim it\u2019s because their audience is homophobic. I find that to be rarely the case, it\u2019s often that people just don\u2019t care, It\u2019s not a big deal. \nI\u2019m bisexual and most people don\u2019t find out for a long time after meeting me, it\u2019s just not something I feel I have to announce.", "How? How is talking about shopping, movies they've gone to, books they've read, etc. talking about their straightness?", "Yes, same. It\u2019s not a big deal. Love whomever you want, have sex with whomever you choose. I think our world is full of insecure people who seek attention for all the wrong reasons. Being gay doesn\u2019t make you special, it just makes you gay. \n\nI also notice the same type of behavior from some parents of kids with disabilities sometimes, especially Autism.", "because they also say they \"went with their wife\". People tend to talk about their partners or exes a lot without realizing. If someone who is gay say the same thing, they are \"flaunting their gayness\" and people get upset", "NTA\n\nI know homophobia *could* be the reason she was asked to leave, but it wasn't.

That's how it is now, ppl want to gaslight you or call you names to try and make you feel guilty. And you shouldn't in this case.

(For whatever reason), this person was trying to cause a scene and get a reaction. You obliged her. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that.", "NTA The girl is a narcissist, a real annoying one", "NAH I think straight people forget that when you are gay a lot of people try to demean your relationship and almost always assume if you\u2019re in a relationship that it is hetero, she was just doing her usual thing and you guys thought it was over the top and expressed that. No one did anything wrong in this situation", "NTA she sounds like those girls that get engaged and find a way to use fiance in every sentence. Like we get it you're not alone, congrats.", "Agreed NTA.  The girl sounds like one of those \"look at me\" types,  desperate for attention.", "It could've been a club or social activity. Not everything you do in college has to be a class. OP didn't specify it was a class", "If it was a club or social activity, OP could have left and come back at the next meet up. OP said she wants to stay single and explained that the activity was to match the single people up, which would be a weird icebreaker, unless this was a club or social group for single people. Which if it was, then why were couples there? There is something odd about the set up to the OP's story.", "That\u2019s bc being straight to you is normal, being gay is literally still a crime in parts of this world. Why do straight people not understand that you literally get murdered to this day just for being gay. They\u2019re loud, proud, and they\u2019re not ashamed of who they love. Why is it when straight people are 100% throwing it in your face they\u2019re straight that you think it\u2019s normal but when gay people do it it\u2019s for attention? People designate literal babies as straight with clothes, it\u2019s all in our media, but whenever it\u2019s gay it\u2019s \u201ctoo much\u201d Reflect on that, I don\u2019t need a response", "Go on tiktok plenty of videos with people putting it in their bio, username, doing content off it, having rainbow merchandise. Some people very much do make it their whole personality.", "Straight is the default though. If nearly everyone is one thing then you call that the default.", "So then everyone should just be assholes with this mindset? Grow up \ud83d\ude44", "See, I don't understand comments like yours. I fully get that the other girl's emotions are not OP's responsibility and that's a fair argument. But I don't see the point of brining up the fact that not everyone is nice. For one, that's obvious. Do you think I've never had people be mean to be before? Second, I fail to see the point. Who cares if other people are mean, impatient, etc.? I should be less nice because other people aren't nice? I don't care what other people are doing, I care about my own reactions. OP came here asking about being an AH. I offered suggestions for a kinder way to approach the situation. OP is welcome to take them or leave them. But arguing she shouldn't be kind just because the world isn't a \"safe space\" isn't a good argument. That's like saying people should feel free to punch each other because the world isn't free of violence, or that you should feel comfortable calling someone slurs because they're probably going to get called them anyway in the \"real world.\" \n\nPlus, college is about learning interpersonal skills necessary for the work place. In the real world, sure, not everyone is going to listen to your bs without calling you out. But in a workplace, you're expected to know how to deescalate situations in a way that won't lead to getting yourself in trouble with an HR team. If this had happened in a workplace environment, I can easily see OP getting reported to HR. I don't think it would be a deserved report, but I could still see it happening. And a lot of HR departments I know would lecture OP about handling conflict better, even if they also lectured the other girl. Especially if the complaint involved an issue like homophobia.", "This is a tough one.  But I can judge all actions right?  Esh.  I'm gonna channel rslash here.  Op gets 1 butthole for not playing the game how it was intended.  Girl gets 2 for making a big deal of her sexuality.   The college gets 2 for the strange dating game type game.

Those are the people who suck I think.", "Yeah, there is an icebreaker I've used in the classroom, where I have the students' \"speed date\", though I do not to use the term. One row stays seated, and the other moves. I provide the kids with a generic question/topic for each \"round\", and at the end, the students share facts they learned about each other. \n\nI might poach the one your class did, but I teach middle and high school ... awkward age group to stand in front of the room with their back turned.", "You're spot on about not being responsible for other people's feelings. Just like people are responsible for their own emotions.\n\nIf this was a hetero person behaving like that it would be JUST as annoying. \n\nThe sexuality is not the issue, the girls reaction is. How is it okay to go around accusing people of being homophobic just because they dont like you as a person.", "My aunt who is a gay taught me that when you met someone who the first 3 sentences out of their mouth has to do with their sexuality. You really don't want to get to know them because that is all they are about. She did not mean like I my name is and this is my girlfriend or boyfriend kind of thing. She always said do who you want but act normal. I love my aunt for this lesson and ut also applies to other things as well.", "But, she apparently wasn't just mentioning her girlfriend, which is no big deal. According to OP, she kept interjecting why people weren't interested in her girlfriend and finding out info on her, which is weird."]}
