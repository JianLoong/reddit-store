Obviously, that's not what you meant here. However, when you use the same language that is typically used to insult someone, they're not going to hear your actual message. Instead, they're going to associate what you're saying with all the actual homophobes who've said the same thing.\n\nPlus, I do think it's important to note that you have no idea what this girl's past relationship to her sexuality is. Maybe she's never been in an environment where she can safely talk about having a gf, and she's overly excited. Maybe she's trying to test the waters to see how cool people are with it (and doing so poorly). Sure, she was being cringey, but she wasn't hurting anyone. So showing a little more discretion probably would have been a better move. \n\nNext time, try redirecting the conversation. Or maybe even asking her basic questions about her girlfriend.

You say you have nothing against LGBTQ+ individuals, but your behavior suggests otherwise. It's not \"annoying\" for someone to talk about their relationship, regardless of their sexual orientation. You had no right to tell her to \"tone it down\" just because you weren't interested in hearing about her girlfriend.

I get that you were annoyed but jeez, just the way you describe her feels pretty mean-spirited. y'all are young; cut her some slack.", "NTA. But as a gay woman myself let me provide some context for what might be going on with this girl. \n\nComing to terms with sexuality can be such a hard experience to go through. Especially if you went to religious schools as a kid and had it branded into your brain from a very young and impressionable age that being anything but heterosexual was a sign of some sort of moral or spiritual corruption or deficiency of your character. \n\nThe self hatred for something you cant change about yourself, the additional struggles it creates as you\u2019re going through adolescence and trying to discover who you are as a person, can be absolutely soul destroying. \n\nWhen you finally manage to get the stage where you accept and embrace this element of yourself after so much pain, it\u2019s such a euphoric and liberating experience that for many people, they start to wrap their whole identities around this truth about themselves that they suffered so much for. Unfortunately this often comes at the cost of neglecting to develop and work on other areas of their personality and making their sexuality the personality in and of itself rather than just a piece of the puzzle that is their identity as a person. When this occurs, it often manifests in people who find ways to bring their sexuality into literally every sentence of every conversation they have and it can be extremely annoying for the people around them. \n\nThey\u2019re at the stage where they think they\u2019ve accepted themselves and worked through all their issues so they don\u2019t realise this is an after effect of the trauma they suffered on their journey to self acceptance. \n\nAgain, OP. You are NTA. But I just wanted to provide some context that it\u2019s very possible this girl wasn\u2019t doing this just to be a pain in the ass. She\u2019s likely scarred from the journey it took to get to the stage where she could proudly boast to a room of people that she\u2019s gay.
