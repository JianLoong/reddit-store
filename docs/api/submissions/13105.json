Maybe they would end up in a couple.\n\nI want to mention that I'm a girl and I'm single and happy to. The activity started with us splitting in two groups: the single ones and the ones in a couple. I joined the couple group because I know the activity is aimed to pair up some of us and I don't want any involvement. I'm happy to be single and don't want to change that now.\n\nWhen I walked over to the couple group many asked me if I had a boyfriend and I replied \"no\" and explained my reasoning. Another girl who is a lesbian was also jumping around saying things like \"I ain't got a boyfriend either, I have a GIRLfriend\" or \"ask me about MY boyfriend\". I have absolutely nothing against LGBTQ but this girl was annoying. Everyone knew already she is a lesbian and I personally don't care. As long as I'm not involved, why should I? I barely talk to the girl anyways so why would I be interested in her relationships?\n\nAnyways I noticed the eye rolls around the group when she kept pestering us about her gf and eventually told her that she's gotta realize her being in a couple IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE BASED ON THE FAC THAT THEY HAVE A PARTNER is not such a big deal and asked her to tone it down.\n\nShe lost it. Called me an ah, told me I'm homophobic and that I'm one of the reasons she can't be treated normal and many more. I told her that I don't care what she likes. I told her that if she wants to be treated \"normal\" the first step is to ACT normal. If she runs around yelling about her partner be it whatever she wants, this is not normal. Yeah she still didn't calm down so eventually people asked her to leave.

Probably for the best she was asked to leave - but it won't help with her victim complex.", "NTA. She\u2019s annoying af. Obviously wants sooooo badly to be treated differently.", "NTA, if she HAD a boyfriend and was acting like this she\u2019d get the same treatment so it\u2019s in no way homophobic. She needs to chill.", "INFO: 1. Was the classmate the only LGTQ+ person in the group and/or class that you know of? 2. What was the assignment or objective of this division into groups, because this:\n>I know the activity is aimed to pair up some of us and I don't want any involvement.\n\nis not sounding academic", "NTA - She\u2019s making her sexuality her personality. Which is boring. Whoopy\u2026you\u2019re gay. Let\u2019s move on. Throwing it out there constantly is just vying for attention.", "NTA\n\nBeing queer/lgbt isn't anything to brag about.\n\nI hate when people immediately call someone \"homophobic/racist/any other -ist\" just to deflect on the other person. You didn't say or do anything that suggests that you're against her being a lesbian. She just wants to look like a victim to gain sympathy points.", "NTA. Sometimes annoying people need to be told to cool it.", "NTA. Maybe you weren't the most gentle about it, but nothing you said was untrue, self-centered, or meant to harm. Sometimes people need a wakeup call about their behavior.", "So long as it played out as you say, NTA. She was being annoying.", "ESH. She sounds annoying, but so do you. You joined an activity aimed at single people, lied about being in a relationship to not be paired with someone, then got mean and condescending to her for talking about her partner in a group whose only connection (other than you, again, because you lied) was having partners.", "She sounds exhausting. NTA", "NTA BUT terrible word choice. Gay people get told all the time they need to tone down their relationships and act normal, in a way that really means they shouldn't show any signs they're gay. Obviously, that's not what you meant here. However, when you use the same language that is typically used to insult someone, they're not going to hear your actual message. Instead, they're going to associate what you're saying with all the actual homophobes who've said the same thing.\n\nPlus, I do think it's important to note that you have no idea what this girl's past relationship to her sexuality is. Maybe she's never been in an environment where she can safely talk about having a gf, and she's overly excited. Maybe she's trying to test the waters to see how cool people are with it (and doing so poorly). Sure, she was being cringey, but she wasn't hurting anyone. So showing a little more discretion probably would have been a better move. \n\nNext time, try redirecting the conversation. Or maybe even asking her basic questions about her girlfriend. If she got to share details about her relationship, she'd probably be less focused on trying to insert that the relationship exists in the first place.", "It's probably coming from a place of a lot of pain. People don't just wake up and act like that. Every time someone like all of the people complaining in the comments is inconvenienced it's usually because someone with trauma is reacting.\n\nAs a trans woman when someone asks me why I never had kids it hecking hurts. When someone does it to my husband right in front of me it hecking hurts. \n\nThere are plenty of reasons why someone would be emotionally hurt and just because these people don't sympathize or empathize doesn't mean people around you don't deserve compassion in their darkest hour.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have just kept your reaction to an eye roll like everyone else. That\u2019s the appropriate reaction. Who are you to put her in her place? Was she hurting anyone? No. Being an over exuberant pest doesn\u2019t merit what you did which inevitably humiliated her. It was unkind to call her out and totally unnecessary.", "NTA, she was being annoying.", "YTA.  So OP purposefully joined a group they didn't belong in and then called out someone in that group for mentioning why they were a part of it?\n\nYup, you're an AH.  Also, I love how OP makes the girl being in that group part of their attack when they themselves don't belong in it.", "YTA. Annoying people exist. That's life. Some gay people are annoying about their relationships, and some straight people are too. You could have just as easily not said anything and gone on with your life. You were never going to change her mind. The best way to deal with attention-seekers is to not give them attention and move on.", "Yta you said alot of stuff that can be miscontrued\n\nLike \u2018if you wAnt to be treated normal, act normal\u2019\n\nReally you telling a homosexual to act normal when youre criticizing her about bringing up her homosexual partner? Sounds homophobic", "ESH - she was attention seeking and being annoying, sure - but you told her that her sexuality is not normal, which reinforced her behaviour and put you in the wrong as well.", "NTA", "YTA obviously you do care since you're so annoyed at her speaking. Not caring means not caring. It doesn't mean getting annoyed and lashing out.", "INFO how does op feel about cherry chapstick?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
