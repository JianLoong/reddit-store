Could be he\u2019s on the same page as you. Whatever, it\u2019s time to put something in place for if or when the time comes that his sibling needs care. Really it\u2019s up to the parents to sort all this, assuming the two of you will take on that role is very short sighted of them.", "NTA.  Bring this up with your husband now. No way is it on you to quit your job to be a full-time caregiver. This will be a responsibility for your husband and his sister to divide.  My neighbor had a brother in much the same condition as your husband's sibling. When her parents died, she was about fifty, he a little younger. She took responsibility but had him in a small group home because he was simply too much for her\u2014too strong, too volatile. She would sometimes bring him to her home for the weekend, but as she got older, even that became too much. Towards the end of his life\u2014he died last year\u2014she bought a house to convert into a care facility, hired people to work there/stay there, because he was getting kicked out of the place he'd been in as he'd begun to have outbursts that were too much for the other residents. Her other brother and an older sister helped her financially, but the emotional burden and all decision making was hers. It was something she signed up for, yet knowing her limitations, she never had him with her full time as he had been with their parents.", "As someone who grew up with  a severely disabled sibling (severe intellectual disability and level 3 autism) and is still dealing  the impacts from it NTA. It is not up to you or your husband to figure out your BILs living situation that responsibility is with your in laws. Growing up in that situation is tough you\u2019re always put second to everyone and everything.  Advocate  for your daughter as she will be impacted by this  and be honest with your husband and tell him you wouldn\u2019t be able to cope", "Nothing happend yet. Just talk to your husband and hear him out and come to an agreement so that you are prepared if/when it comes up.", "NTA, now is the time to clarify your situation and tell those involved that you will not be the caregiver.", "NTA talk to him NOW!!!", "NTA but if you think it needs to be discussed, you need to discuss it, not wait for things ro unfold", "It sounds like no conversation happened yet, so we don't know if the plan even is you yet. \n\nActually *talk* to your husband, find out if that is their plan.\n\nNothing to judge yet.", "No conflict here.  Nothing to judge.\n\nGo have the conversation with your spouse  now.  This isn't an advice forum.", "Don't  assume.  Have a conversation with your husband first .", "NTA for not feeling good because it isn't discussed before. However YTA for just assuming the other sibling can take care it of.  \n\n\nTalk to your husband. Don't ignore it like it does not excist. Have the talk and also the honest talk about maybe getting him in a 24 hour care or assisted living?   \n\n\nThere is a way of taking care of him without caring 24/7 by yourself!", "nta", "NTA and you DO NOT need to be this person's care taker!\n\nYou described many valid reasons as to why you do not wish to become a full time caretaker. Let me give you a few more.\n\n1. You and potentially your husband, but you definitely are not qualified to be taking care of someone with this level of complex needs. This person needs around the clock care, like an infant. Getting someone to help you out once in a while so you can drop your daughter off at school, see a soccer game whatever is going to be nearly impossible, not to mention the fact that again- you don't have the necessary training or support to take this on.\n\n2. You have a young child that needs and _deserves_ your full attention. Read the stories of siblings of severely disabled children- your husband likely needs some therapy if he isn't already putting his foot down for your daughters sake! Your daughter is a person with needs too and it'll be near impossible to fulfill her needs if you have to give your soul to someone else.\n\n\nObviously no one wants to send a family member to a group home or facility but sometimes that's what's best for them and I think that's what's best here. It's very possible with getting adequate support your husband's sibling may gain a little functioning. If your forget your own needs for a moment- it is truly in this person's best interest to get the support ans care they need- not sub par care from an exhausted and unqualified sister in law.\n\nDon't feel bad for a second OP. Urge your husband to speak now so the transition for your sibling in law is smooth and not hectic.", "NTA. Better get the word out now. You are  NOT the defacto caregiver bc they say so. Nope. Never. If they thought that, then they are delusional", "NTA\u2026unless you fail to bring it up to your husband. You must do so soon. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve discussed this with your parents, but what is the care plan for Sibling when your parents are no longer able to handle their needs?\u201d It\u2019s the first step in a much longer conversation.", "It's not a joke if the parents threatens action that they will change their mind about who cares for this person. Have a very serious talk and be blunt about what you need and that is a hard no. You have to put your daughter first and that's it. Don't let anyone bully you into taking care of him when this doesn't suit your situation and yes it's alot to take care of someone with these needs.\n\nNta", "ESH\n\nThese are conversations that should be had before marriage.", "NTA, but you kinda knew the sibling was special needs prior to marriage. That should have been a conversation since your spouse may be required to help his sibling, as we see now.", "Look I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because nobody has said or even suggested that you are going to be his caregiver, this is what happens when you eavesdrop on other people\u2019s conversations and get it all wrong. You don\u2019t love your brother in law, you are embarrassed and ashamed of him and how dare you! That\u2019s your husband\u2019s brother and you sound awful", "YTA. When you marry into a family you marry into all the obligations as well of the benefits. You knew he had a disabled sibling, and you knew one day his parents would die. What did you think would happen? You need to talk to your husband now. If you aren't willing to support him through his family obligations, you don't deserve the benefits of being married to him. If you try to prevent him from doing what he feels is his duty you would be in the wrong. If he tells you he intends to take care of the sibling later on, then file for divorce. The situation is not going to change because you want it to. You will be the major AH if you try to get him to abandon his sibling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
