Ex-wife (Mary) and I are still great friends, and we support one another when it comes to raising Jay. I majority of the time raise and parent Jay with my current partner (Sam) as Mary thought it would be best for Jay to have male role-models. We have him for most of the week, and he stays over with Mary on Saturday night. All in all, we have a good family circumstance.\n\nMonday morning, Jay\u2019s school called about him bullying and insulting a younger student\u2019s body shape. Mary, I, and Sam have always taught Jay about respect, but since he started to go through puberty, he has been somewhat cocky about his looks and fitness. Attitude at home is instantly squashed, but we never expected him to bully at school.\n\nThe school suspended him from rugby for a fortnight. I had seen a video where a father made his son run to school for bullying another student, and I would copy it, but after-school when he would usually have training or games. Both Mary and Sam agreed that it was fair, and I left work early to issue my consequence.\n\nInstead of picking Jay up as Sam would after training, I had my running gear on and Sam waiting. I told Jay to throw his stuff in the car and that we were running home together. 1: so I could make sure he was safe and 2: to discuss with him his actions. In the hour and half run, I had talked Jay\u2019s ear off, and he was more remorseful about his actions. I told him this was week-long, along with phone ban at home, and that this should remind him to be respectful.\n\nWednesday and today, the weather turned cold and wet. I still stuck to the running but made sure that Sam didn't leave first and was ready to drive us home if the rain became too heavy. It didn\u2019t so we made it home, but soaked and chilled. I made sure that Jay quickly showered and dried and sent a message to Mary updating her.\n\nAfter dinner, I got a few calls. Mary said that it wasn\u2019t right that I made Jay run in the rain, and that it could have gotten him sick, despite agreeing that I should stick to the consequence. My ex-MIL took it one step further and blew me up on the phone, saying that I was abusing Jay and that Mary should keep him for the week. I told both that I took precautions, and Mary subsided, but ex-MIL continued ranting.\n\nIt\u2019s now become a bigger issue with the extended family on three sides, almost split agreeing and disagreeing. It\u2019s made me doubt whether I should have just taken these two days off and carried it on to next week, but I also thought me and Sam made enough precautions to counter the weather, and that Jay is a fit athletic teenager who\u2019s played games in the rain.\n\nSo, AITA for making my son run in the rain as punishment for him bullying others?\n\nEDIT: Our house is a thirty-minute run from school, so it was only Monday's run which was hour and half due to me stopping and talking to Jay. The other days have been half hour runs.", "created_utc": 1686226113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1447hz2/aita_for_making_my_son_run_in_the_rain/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My guess is no - so they shouldn't be upset with you either. \n\nOn a side note - I commend you for teaching Jay that bullying is not ok. Too many parents take the kids side and do nothing about it, which perpetuates the problem.", "NTA\n\nYou ran with him, right? So it was the two of you going for a run in the rain, which runners do ALL THE TIME. Being cold and wet DOES NOT make you sick, that's an old wives tale. No harm, no foul.", "NTA. It\u2019s only the rain. Sounds like you have a healthy and constructive way of dealing with bad behaviour, and Jay needs to understand that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him. Mothers tend to worry a lot, it\u2019s hardwired into them, so I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s the asshole either, but this is his problem, not hers.", "NTA. \n\nAs everyone involved is okay with the method of punishment, let's assume running home 1,5 hours is okay. \n\nThe problem for people is therefore running *in rain*. wtf? Ofc you can run in the rain. Especially when you immediately shower and dry up afterwards.", "So you are doing the run every day for one week after school together yes? You get good father/son time too. You both got wet out in the rain. That does not make you sick. I would have loved a parent who cared that much about me. Good going.", "NTA\n\nHe plays rugby.  Can you imagine the chaos if the Six Nations was cancelled because the players' mums would not let them play in the rain??", "Rugby gets played in the rain, so why not run in it? So NTA", "No you're not the asshole and I applaud you for sticking to your guns. I was bullied relentlessly through school, as was my boyfriend and it has affected us both well into adulthood. Bullying does not \"build character\", it damages children and makes them want to end their own lives.", "INFO: what does Mary and ex MIL think about Jay playing rugby? has they ever seen any of the trainings or matches? cause those can get pretty intense, more than a run under the rain I think.", "NTA. You took precautions, he\u2019s played in games with the same conditions. And he needs this lesson. As a kid who was bullied, it was the parents who enabled them. Good on you for stopping him.", "NTA.  Have you ever seen the conditions under which rugby players compete?  Running in the rain, especially with one's oldster father, doesn't seem like that big a deal.\n\nThis kid's fathers seem to have taken appropriate steps to ensure that he was safe. I'm sure that when they got home, the kid showered and changed. \n\nAs for butt-in family, ask them if they're upset about not being invited to join you.", "NTA, as we said, you aren't made out of sugar. I don't see any harm in walking in the normal rain. And also good for stickig to it.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I think the punishment is extreme but thats because I hate cardio. If I had to run that long I'd have called you AH. You didn't ask for judgement on the punishment however just the circumstance regarding it and rain. I think the concern your ex has was warranted but I cant gauge what light or heavy rain might mean to you so cannot say either way. You say you took adequate precautions which I believe you did. I think as long as you did it with him that's good enough for me.", "NTA. This was good parenting. You made clear that what he did was serious. Well done.", "NTA. everything you did sounds like solid parenting done with love and consideration for your child. the extended family can be upset if they want, but you weren't being unreasonable and you were with him the whole time, with a contingency plan in case it became unsafe.", "NTA. The kid isn\u2019t going to melt. If people are this angry it\u2019s because they have other issues with the living arrangement and are using this as an excuse to attack that.", "NTA.  As you said, he\u2019s played games in similar conditions. It was not unsafe, and even still you took additional precautions and you ran with him.  He was fine.  \n\nBullying is serious, and I like the fact that your consequence for him was not strictly punitive, it also gave you an opportunity to talk to him about his behavior.", "NTA", "Nta, this was a very good way of going about the issue. Yr son seems to be learning from yr talks and you are taking the time with him. You are doing a good job here.", "NTA. Physical exercise is an underutilized punishment. Growing up in my hometown, if a member of the highschool football team was stopped by the cops for minor offenses there wouldn't be legal consequences but the police would tell the football coach, who would then set us straight after practice with many gassers. Maybe not a fair system (for non players), but I watched my speed after that.", "He\u2019s almost old enough to join the armed forces and they don\u2019t give a shit about weather.", "NTA.  Could he get sick?  I suppose.  People, in general, are far more resilient than they think.  Soldiers in the military have to march (run) in the rain on the regular.  People throughout history, have had to travel in inclement weather by foot, horse, or whatever on the regular.  Just because we have the convenience of cars now it suddenly becomes abusive to make the kid run in the rain?  Ridiculous.  I would, in fact, call it a blessing that the weather took a SMALL turn for the worse during the time of his consequences.  I applaud your decisiveness and your willingness to hold your son accountable.  You sound like you are raising a good strong person in the making.", "NTA. You took safety precautions, ensured he had appropriate kit and ran with him. He\u2019s a fit and healthy teenager- running in the rain won\u2019t make him sick. Having his ear talked off for an hour and a half might make him think twice about being unkind to others though!", "NTA, good parenting.", "NTA \n\nWell done Dad!  You kept to his punishment, made sure there were precautionary measures in place AND you ran with him.    Talk about Dad goals!  You're smashing it out of the park!\n\nTell those extended family members and ex MIL to do one lol", "NTA also if he's normally in rugby, they would be making him practice and run and such, yes? And by being suspended he's not able to do that yes? Then essentially,  the \"punishment\" is really also helping him keep up with the fitness level needed for rugby....I would imagine 2 weeks off with no activity is not good. Even more commendable is you are doing it WITH him. So therefore showing him you care about him. Maybe if more bullies parents took this issue seriously enough to truly address it then we would have less bullies. \n\nGood job Dad! I commend you! All these y t a don't seem to get this kid probably runs just as much or more at practice and yes even in the rain.", "Being wet or cold does not make people sick.  What is this, the Middle Ages?", "As a completely out of shape person it\u2019s bonkers how many people in the comments think a 30 minute run is some kind of abusive punishment. A reasonably healthy person should be able to do that without intense struggle. And in this case it\u2019s a 15 year old rugby athlete. How sedentary are y\u2019all that you\u2019ve lost any sense or what\u2019s reasonable movement???", "NTA?\n\nDon\u2019t know why people are saying you are?\nIt\u2019s only a week, you\u2019re doing it with him so you\u2019re out there too. You had a contingency plan in case it was too much and he\u2019s not going to get sick for being out in the rain. It\u2019s a myth.\n\nYou\u2019re best off being hard now and nipping the bullying business in the bud now before it gets out of hand. You\u2019re doing society a favour.", "NTA\nLast time I checked rain is not toxic, it's water. Football doesn't have rain brakes why should running?\n\nEdit: I think 1.5h long runes for a week is a very harsh punishment.", "If you're saying OP is the AH, you probably revolve your parenting around whether or not they can use their iPad all day.\n\nOP is NTA, and a more present and caring father than most of us have likely had.", "NTA he literally plays rugby, a game that is very well known for being played in the rain.  Going on a 30 minute run in the rain is literally nothing by comparison.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure his team was practicing in the rain, so a 30 minute run versus a several hours long practice is a moot point.

I learn to drive at 4?", "I mean, it\u2019s literally not, but what would you have done?", "I don't know anyone who doesn't have at least one car.", "My parents rarely drove me to school but times have changed. Back then a lot less people had cars. In sayimg that we didnt live in walking distance to school so we caught the bus. Also in rural areas which is where I live a car and being able to drive is a necessity.", "Well to me it is. Also consequences should relate to the  crime. If that were my child there would be a serious talk about respecting others amd why bullying is not ok. There would be device ban except for school work especially phone because the behavior shows he can be trusted not to bully. There would also be a weeksgroundimg because again they have proven that they can't be trusted not to bully. And most importantly they would have to write an apology letter to the child they bullied.", "Well aren\u2019t you privileged.", "You didn't answer my question. In my situation what do you propose? \n\nI'd still have to walk to the bus stop in the rain resulting in 'abuse'?", "So nearly the same as OP\u2019s punishment, except the talks are happening while they go running together.", "NTA\n\nRain doesn\u2019t make people ill, and running in the rain isn\u2019t abuse.\n\nI\u2019m a little baffled how you think giving a fit teenager who uses that as a reason to bully someone more exercise is an effective consequence though.", "NTA.", "Nta. Youre doing some good parenting there don\u2019t let anybody tell you any different.", "NTA you ran with him, it was used as an opportunity to talk rather than a \"punishment\" and you made sure he was dried off as soon as you got home. He's fine, and it seems like an effective method for you two to bond.", "NTA the rain won\u2019t kill you.", "Your extended family need to learn to mind their own business. They are not responsible for parenting your kid. You, Mary and Sam get to make the decisions.", "Yta", "NTA. You were there with him. Ppl don't melt by getting wet. You  made sure he got warm and dry when he got home. You also had a back-up in case the weather got too bad. I'm sure that your son has played in rain or WORSE. As for your ex-MIL, she is not the parent. She can STFU.", "NTA. I personally love to run in the rain. It won\u2019t kill him.", "NTA he's a fucking rugby player not a crystalline sugar princess ffs if he keeps playing into adulthood it's the first of many downpours he will be running in\n\n\\-former rugger", "People run in the rain all the time. People play sports in the rain. People bike in the rain. People walk in the rain. \n\nIt sounds like Mary was initially concerned and got over it quickly. The bigger AH in this situation is your ex-MIL who is calling you abusive(!) and saying you need to change the parenting arrangement you and your ex have agreed to. That's a huge overstepping of boundaries right there. \n\nYou are NTA, and I applaud you for being a parent who is taking an active role in molding their child into a good person. It's not easy, but it's worth it.", "NTA \n\nYou as parents agreed and it\u2019s really no one\u2019s business what punishment you give him as long as he\u2019s not abused (which he\u2019s NOT)", "NTA.", ">Being cold and wet DOES NOT make you sick, that's an old wives tale. \n\nOmg one more time for the old wives in the back!! I got fussed at by my ex for walking around my own apartment without a towel on my hair when I came out of the shower. Apparently humanity hasn't evolved enough for me to survive the AC at 71 while I'm drippy.", "Why is extended family on either side even aware of your chosen punishment? It is NONE of their business. Tell all the flying monkeys to return to their nests and kind their own business.\n\nMy kids are all young and even they have played rec sports in the rain and snow.your ex MIL and the rest of them need to get a grip.", "This is so heat\n\nAt first I was a bit taken back by running as a punishment but you did it the only right way!"]}
