We met at our local D&D club and have been hanging out for years. \n\nWe\u2019ve been doing this great campaign for about a month now, & we\u2019d been planning to have our campaign finale (with themed snacks, drinks and decorations) in V\u2019s apartment - he has the biggest cos he shares with his gf. V also lives with his little sister A (F11), after his mom died a few years ago. \n\nThe plan had been for his gf to look after A at her parents place, but day of he messages us saying that she can\u2019t babysit anymore because her mom fell on some ice and was in the hospital. He offered that we could either rearrange or we could do it with A there, she\u2019d just play video games in the background.\n\nImmediately L and R say they don\u2019t have an issue with her being there and we could even make her her own character for the campaign. I couldn\u2019t understand this though? It was meant to be just us, and putting in a random new character in the finale would ruin it. Plus, A is super clingy to V, so I knew it would take his attention off the campaign if she was there.\n\nI asked V if he couldn\u2019t find an alternative babysitter before the evening so we could still do it as planned. He said he didn\u2019t want to put A with someone she didn\u2019t know so last minute for something easily rearrangeable because he knew it would upset her.\n\nI got annoyed then at him calling our event \u2018rearrangeable\u2019 and called him out on it. He said I had to be joking if I thought a D&D campaign was more important to him than his little sisters comfort. I said I obviously wasn\u2019t saying that, but I wasn\u2019t prepared to have our night turned into free babysitting. \n\nV said he had already offered to rearrange, and that I was free to host myself sometime if I had such a problem with his sister. This was uncalled for because he knows I can\u2019t host because I don\u2019t have the time or space to prepare /  clean them up. \n\nL and R both privately messaged me and basically said I was the only one who cared, and that we should be sympathetic to Vs situation. I have a lot of respect for V, but I still don\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t have just put A with a babysitter for an evening so our plans didn\u2019t get ruined, or why his gf couldn\u2019t take her to the hospital too. How is not wanting some random child at our game night an issue?\n\nThey ended up hanging out that night (I was invited but I didn\u2019t go) and doing a one-shot campaign, which also annoyed me because we always play D&D together. \n\nMy mom thinks I was an AH because V is \u2018raising a child by himself\u2019, but he has money from his inheritance and gets help from his gfs family, so he isn\u2019t \u2018alone\u2019. My brothers agree that I\u2019m not TA here because V shouldn\u2019t baby A so much that he won\u2019t put her with a babysitter. \n\nI want some reassurance on this so I\u2019ve come here lol.

I'd recommend apologizing because A is going to be at the center of V's life for at least the next 7 years. She is going to be around on game night sometimes.

D&D sessions don't take priority over Real Life.\n\nV is not \"babysitting\", nor did he ask you (or your other friends) to babysit.   He is taking care of his responsibilities.

You said she's very clingy to V.  I bet she is very clingy but your can't understand that right\n3. You want her to go to the hospital with the gf.  Are you out your freaking mind?\n4. You sound so spoiled.  You got mad because he called your event \u2018rearrangeable\u2019\n5. OMG and the AH move was when you didn't know it was going to turn into a free babysitting \n6. You and your brother should never have kids or have kids anywhere near you.

Good luck with that.", "YTA his child, yes his child that he is raising is more important than a d@mn D&D game. She's not crashing the game the person who was watching her had a family emergency so he gave you two option rearrange the date or have her hang out. \n\nBut you're throwing a tantrum like a child. Grow up you're not 15  this is not a boyz only girls are icky and have cooties club ffs.", "YTA ... the kid is 11, I started playing D&D back in the day right around that same age. You are gate keeping at best or just downright selfish for not seeing why V would be more focused on his responsibility to his family than a game.", "YTA. It's his sister that he is raising because their mother died. So what if he has an inheritance? So what if he has a girlfriend? I get that the campaign is important to you, but seriously. Read the room.", "YTA. I don\u2019t want to be at a party with a kid either, but you have the choice to not go. It\u2019s his house AND THE SISTER LIVES THERE.", "YTA. There are countless ways that you could've handled this. Their solution of doing a one-shot campaign sounds perfect.\n\nYes D&D can be rescheduled. You can be disappointed but there are way more important things. Babysitting a younger sibling is one of them", "YTA. I'd be thrilled to play DnD with a sibling or kid. What a wonderful opportunity to get them into a great game! Sure, maybe that episode may be slower than normal due to a new player but you should embrace the awesomeness of someone joining.", "Honestly, dude, YTA. Hopefully you're open enough to understand why after reading the responses here. You really do come across as someone who sees a game as more important than empathizing with others.\n\nIt's this kind of controlling, thoughtless, and hurtful attitude that has permanently turned me away from TTRPGs.", "Unless there was a typo and you meant that you and your friends are all 12 and not 22? If not, then yeah YTA and you sound like a child.", "YTA, obviously. A was going to play games in the background. I also think it\u2019s a stretch to say her character addition would ruin the campaign finale. DMs are generally clever in the way they do this and I don\u2019t think it would ruin it. And you got mad that they did a one shot without you?? Seriously?? They were nice enough to stave off the campaign finale for you and replaced it with a one shot and you still had the audacity to be offended, even though *you were invited.* Furthermore, you not being able to host due to \u201cnot having the time to plan\u201d makes you even more of an AH. So is V the DM? He\u2019s raising a kid by himself, one he didn\u2019t sign up to raise, I am assuming working, and is doing all this planning for y\u2019all\u2019s campaign. So you should have bit your tongue and sucked it up. Also, his sister is 11. Of course she will need some TLC. Babying her at this stage is not a bad thing. It\u2019s not unfair of him that he didn\u2019t want to put her with a stranger, especially since her presence would likely not have been an issue whatsoever. You went the scorched earth route for absolutely no reason at all and I think you\u2019d be very lucky to be invited to the next campaign.", "YTA. You're being nasty about an 11-yo kid who just this one time *cannot* be shuffled off to her brother's girlfriend for babysitting, because the girlfriend's mother has been injured & needs her help. You are also the only person in the group who has absolutely no understanding or sympathy for the circumstances that caused this change in plans. Life happens, & being adaptable is a much more useful trait than being completely inflexible, particularly when yes, your event *is* rearrangeable.", "YTA. Don't be surprised if you aren't invited to the next campaign. Or anything further with any of them really.\n\nIt sounds like they had fun without you. They probably realize they had fun without you. They may be questioning whether your presence in the group is worth putting up with your attitude here.\n\nAnd unless having the sister there was a major disaster, they're going to be weighting your behavior here against you in that consideration... heavily.", "YTA.  A clings to Y because that's all the family she has.  She could probably use some counseling, but is her getting interested in Y's activities a bad thing?", "YTA, also getting big Stranger Things vibe off this post... \n\nFor real though, your friend basically has a kid, maybe he's the first one in your friend circle to have a big life change like this, But he won't be the last. Part of being a good friend is being there through life's chapters. Having friends with kids means you adjust to that, and you find new and different ways to hang out, like including his sister. Your friends seem to get this. You should make an effort to as well.", "Hands down YTA.", "YTA. Also it's almost impossible to find a random babysitter the day of. Babysitters will either already be booked or have their own plans.", "You have major main character vibes emanating off of you and it is super obvious that you haven't considered that... you were invited... to A's home.  It's V's home too but A isn't gatecrashing your session by... daring to exist...  in her own home.  Are you for real?\n\nEvery comment you make is making you look more self centered tbh.  I think you need to do some self reflection.  I don't necessarily think you are intentionally being an AH (although you are, don't get me wrong) I just think you haven't thought of how your actions and reactions to things affect those around you.  \n\nYTA.  talk to V. Apologize.  And maybe instead of being an asshole about A being there next time, teach her about D & D.  Kids have endless creativity and imagination.

It's truly a wonderful thing to do with friends so long as they're compassionate people. To think, that little girl would've have the same idea about TTRPGs if her brother didn't stand up for her, and do a little one shot with her.\n\nOP if you continue to be selfish about the table you will lose the table. Nobody wants to play with a selfish player, especially eith the demands your making. You expect everyone else to do snacks, get a game table, and clean for you, but you couldn't be bothered to do it yourself for your oh-so-important game.

How can someone be so obtuse?", "Depending on variations of current COVID restrictions, it\u2019s possible the 11 year old wouldn\u2019t have even been allowed inside the hospital.", "I know, I couldn't get past that and the \"free babysitting\" comment OP made lol JFC", "Yeah sucks,  but since you don't even have time to clean up your place to host,  then you just gotta roll with it.", "It was a change for everyone. I'm sure V's girlfriend would rather not have had to go to the hospital that night.

Instead you \"called him out on it\" and made a big dramatic thing about V prioritizing his orphaned sibling. Finding a reliable last-minute babysitter is not nearly as simple as you're making it out to be, and your idea that the girlfriend should just take the kid to hang out in a germ-filled hospital all night is frankly ridiculous.\n\nYou're expecting everyone else to bend over backwards to give you the experience you wanted on your desired time frame, and that's not reasonable. Don't be that guy. That guy eventually stops getting invited to tables.", "That\u2019s why you rearrange plans", "And then the babysitter would babysit where? It's her house too. She lives there.

You say you respect V but that respect must have limits, because it\u2019s disrespectful to try to rehome someone\u2019s resident child for your own comfort. Life happens. Shit happens.

YTA.", "Did you seriously suggest that it would be better for the 11 year old to *go to the hospital*? \n\nI can\u2019t fathom that you\u2019re an adult and have zero concept of priorities. It\u2019s a game, not a job interview.", "It was made clear that she would be there, in her own home. \n\nIt was offered that you could reschedule the \u2018event\u2019.  And they just did a one shot, which you could have joined and had fun with instead of sitting at home sulking that the plans didn\u2019t turn out like first envisioned. \n\nUsually it\u2019s: Life + lemons = lemonade.  \n\nYou chose to just bite into them and was left with only the sour taste. That\u2019s on you.", "Nobody else seemed to think it ruined anything. Are you always this inflexible? \nOption--proceed as normal with a kid in the background (nothing ruined)\nOption--Postpone the campaign finale and run a one-off to teach her d&d (nothing ruined)\nOption--Run the finale, give her a bit part that's role-play focused, like a pseudodragon messenger (nothing ruined)\n\nIf I were your group's DM, I would seriously consider booting you. At 22, quite a few members are going to start having serious relationships, pets, kids, demanding jobs. Flexibility is key. I'm not interested in somebody who's going to whinge when things get adjusted or postponed because of life.", "A few commenters have said this but you just gotta lighten up man. It sucks that your finale got rescheduled after all this planning, but shit happens. An emergency happened. You already had food and drinks you could have all hung out and done a fun one shot with the kid and rescheduled the big game. I\u2019m currently in 3 campaigns. I get that it was a big deal. You handled this really poorly and need to reevaluate your priorities. It sounds like *you* ruined this event. Not the child. YTA", "I think I sprained something rolling my eyes.

It could easily be pushed to some other week. Doing a one-shot is a perfect solution.", "\"felt like they did a one-shot just to spite me...\"??? what???? Dude you were literally invited! \n\nNone of your comments are making this better, they're just proving that you completely lack the maturity to both empathize with others AND to own up to your mistakes. \n\nLike it seems like even after dozens of people (including your friends and your mom) say that you are being an AH, you are still gonna be like \"no that can't be right.\" Yeah, it is right. You are being a petulant, child-like AH.", "Maybe the 11 year old was excited to see dnd and when you cancelled they decided to do a one-shot for her. Either way, you shouldn't assume they did it to spite you. You are a MAJOR AH in this story. Please reflect on that.", "Ohhhh nooooooo OP can't have his ~ADULT BEVERAGES~ like he planned.

I get it to a point. But that is where she lives. You are being overbearing and selfish. Also, you can have drinks and stay up late still. Kids being present around drinks is not against the law, nor is it detrimental to them. Just stop, you are in the wrong here. YTA. I would not be surprised if your friends cut down on the amount that they include you in things.", "YTA and don't be surprised if they keep playing without you. v is essentially a father now and despite how much money you think the inheritance is kids are fucking expensive so I'm glad he's not wasting it on babysitters when he'll be there.", "I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t mind her being there, in her own home, while you are just a guest, in her home", "He didn\u2019t try to get one though, he said he wouldn\u2019t put her with one she hadn\u2019t been with before and that\u2019s basically just his gf and her family.", "That's a great idea! \n\nAlso, I play D&D with my nephew who's the same age as A, and if you have the right mindset playing with kids can be really fun. The right mindset is basically anything *other than* \"I will only have fun if I play with the same people I've always played with,\" and at least the three others in the group seem to have that mindset! \n\nI also know that kids benefit enormously from D&D, and it would probably be great for A, especially if she's shy (it sort of sounds like she might be) or isn't super confident. Even if OP can't get on board, it would be great for the other 3 to start a new campaign that includes the kid in some way.", "They didn\u2019t want to do a one shot they could even have started another  pre-written campaign which if she joined in would be better because they are doing easier for new players at least in my experience it would make sense rather than having another player appear right at the end(assuming she joined)and it would also not create as much work with the DM needing to write things and write out a story(though a one shot would probably also do this) etc Besides I assume they\u2019re gonna have another campaign soon anyway unless it\u2019s this supposed to their final DND game ever so why not just start a little early", "Then it sounds to me like he doesn't want to leave her with a stranger and has a lot of respect for her needs.", "So you're mad being he's being a responsible adult? Time to grow up.  I can understand you being a little disappointed that the plans changed.  You acting like it was a huge ordeal and your refusal to compromise is ridiculous.
