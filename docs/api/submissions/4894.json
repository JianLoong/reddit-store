{"id": 4894, "submission_id": "znmduq", "title": "AITA for not wanting my friend\u2019s little sister to crash our D&D campaign?", "selftext": "TA account \n\nI (M22) have a tight friendship group with R, L & V (all M22). We met at our local D&D club and have been hanging out for years. \n\nWe\u2019ve been doing this great campaign for about a month now, & we\u2019d been planning to have our campaign finale (with themed snacks, drinks and decorations) in V\u2019s apartment - he has the biggest cos he shares with his gf. V also lives with his little sister A (F11), after his mom died a few years ago. \n\nThe plan had been for his gf to look after A at her parents place, but day of he messages us saying that she can\u2019t babysit anymore because her mom fell on some ice and was in the hospital. He offered that we could either rearrange or we could do it with A there, she\u2019d just play video games in the background.\n\nImmediately L and R say they don\u2019t have an issue with her being there and we could even make her her own character for the campaign. I couldn\u2019t understand this though? It was meant to be just us, and putting in a random new character in the finale would ruin it. Plus, A is super clingy to V, so I knew it would take his attention off the campaign if she was there.\n\nI asked V if he couldn\u2019t find an alternative babysitter before the evening so we could still do it as planned. He said he didn\u2019t want to put A with someone she didn\u2019t know so last minute for something easily rearrangeable because he knew it would upset her.\n\nI got annoyed then at him calling our event \u2018rearrangeable\u2019 and called him out on it. He said I had to be joking if I thought a D&D campaign was more important to him than his little sisters comfort. I said I obviously wasn\u2019t saying that, but I wasn\u2019t prepared to have our night turned into free babysitting. \n\nV said he had already offered to rearrange, and that I was free to host myself sometime if I had such a problem with his sister. This was uncalled for because he knows I can\u2019t host because I don\u2019t have the time or space to prepare /  clean them up. \n\nL and R both privately messaged me and basically said I was the only one who cared, and that we should be sympathetic to Vs situation. I have a lot of respect for V, but I still don\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t have just put A with a babysitter for an evening so our plans didn\u2019t get ruined, or why his gf couldn\u2019t take her to the hospital too. How is not wanting some random child at our game night an issue?\n\nThey ended up hanging out that night (I was invited but I didn\u2019t go) and doing a one-shot campaign, which also annoyed me because we always play D&D together. \n\nMy mom thinks I was an AH because V is \u2018raising a child by himself\u2019, but he has money from his inheritance and gets help from his gfs family, so he isn\u2019t \u2018alone\u2019. My brothers agree that I\u2019m not TA here because V shouldn\u2019t baby A so much that he won\u2019t put her with a babysitter. \n\nI want some reassurance on this so I\u2019ve come here lol. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ok I see overwhelmingly I am being voted TA. I\u2019m gonna take some time away from reddit now (because I\u2019ve started getting death threats) to think about what happened and then try and talk to V. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019d been appreciating his role as being that of a parent, not just as an older brother, and I need to say sorry. I struggled to make friends in school and D&D was one of those ways I made friends, but I think I\u2019ve been too focused on the game itself rather than the good friends I\u2019ve been playing with. \n\nHopefully I can mend this with everyone. I was afraid of the change but ended up making it worse. Once I\u2019ve thought about what I\u2019m going to say I\u2019ll talk to him and update you. \n\n(Also just to add for those confused:\n1. My issue was never her joining us or being there - it was really that everyone seemed to reach a consensus on changing the whole plan so last minute. I should have just asked to reschedule, I let my excitement for the event get the better of me and was desperate for it to go ahead as planned. \n2. This was the finale of the first arc, which I should have specified. I was attached to it so much after only a month because it\u2019s been our best yet, and I was afraid of it being ruined / changing. But like people have said, the whole point of D&D is change, and no good campaign is made by refusing to accept that. )", "created_utc": 1671217674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znmduq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_friends_little_sister_to/", "score": 379, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd recommend apologizing because A is going to be at the center of V's life for at least the next 7 years. She is going to be around on game night sometimes.

D&D sessions don't take priority over Real Life.\n\nV is not \"babysitting\", nor did he ask you (or your other friends) to babysit.   He is taking care of his responsibilities.

YTA\n\nEdited to add judgment.", "YTA and let me list the reasons why:\n\n1. This child lost her mother and only has her brother to take care of her.  It's not like she's some random stranger.\n2. You said she's very clingy to V.  I bet she is very clingy but your can't understand that right\n3. You want her to go to the hospital with the gf.  Are you out your freaking mind?\n4. You sound so spoiled.  You got mad because he called your event \u2018rearrangeable\u2019\n5. OMG and the AH move was when you didn't know it was going to turn into a free babysitting \n6. You and your brother should never have kids or have kids anywhere near you.

Grow up you're not 15  this is not a boyz only girls are icky and have cooties club ffs.", "YTA ... the kid is 11, I started playing D&D back in the day right around that same age. You are gate keeping at best or just downright selfish for not seeing why V would be more focused on his responsibility to his family than a game.", "YTA. It's his sister that he is raising because their mother died. So what if he has an inheritance? So what if he has a girlfriend? I get that the campaign is important to you, but seriously. Read the room.", "YTA. I don\u2019t want to be at a party with a kid either, but you have the choice to not go. It\u2019s his house AND THE SISTER LIVES THERE.", "YTA. There are countless ways that you could've handled this. Their solution of doing a one-shot campaign sounds perfect.\n\nYes D&D can be rescheduled. You can be disappointed but there are way more important things. Babysitting a younger sibling is one of them", "YTA. I'd be thrilled to play DnD with a sibling or kid. What a wonderful opportunity to get them into a great game! Sure, maybe that episode may be slower than normal due to a new player but you should embrace the awesomeness of someone joining.", "Honestly, dude, YTA. Hopefully you're open enough to understand why after reading the responses here. You really do come across as someone who sees a game as more important than empathizing with others.\n\nIt's this kind of controlling, thoughtless, and hurtful attitude that has permanently turned me away from TTRPGs.", "Unless there was a typo and you meant that you and your friends are all 12 and not 22? If not, then yeah YTA and you sound like a child.", "YTA, obviously. A was going to play games in the background. I also think it\u2019s a stretch to say her character addition would ruin the campaign finale. DMs are generally clever in the way they do this and I don\u2019t think it would ruin it. And you got mad that they did a one shot without you?? Seriously?? They were nice enough to stave off the campaign finale for you and replaced it with a one shot and you still had the audacity to be offended, even though *you were invited.* Furthermore, you not being able to host due to \u201cnot having the time to plan\u201d makes you even more of an AH. So is V the DM? He\u2019s raising a kid by himself, one he didn\u2019t sign up to raise, I am assuming working, and is doing all this planning for y\u2019all\u2019s campaign. So you should have bit your tongue and sucked it up. Also, his sister is 11. Of course she will need some TLC. Babying her at this stage is not a bad thing. It\u2019s not unfair of him that he didn\u2019t want to put her with a stranger, especially since her presence would likely not have been an issue whatsoever. You went the scorched earth route for absolutely no reason at all and I think you\u2019d be very lucky to be invited to the next campaign.", "YTA. You're being nasty about an 11-yo kid who just this one time *cannot* be shuffled off to her brother's girlfriend for babysitting, because the girlfriend's mother has been injured & needs her help. You are also the only person in the group who has absolutely no understanding or sympathy for the circumstances that caused this change in plans. Life happens, & being adaptable is a much more useful trait than being completely inflexible, particularly when yes, your event *is* rearrangeable.", "YTA. Don't be surprised if you aren't invited to the next campaign. Or anything further with any of them really.\n\nIt sounds like they had fun without you. They probably realize they had fun without you. They may be questioning whether your presence in the group is worth putting up with your attitude here.\n\nAnd unless having the sister there was a major disaster, they're going to be weighting your behavior here against you in that consideration... heavily.", "YTA.  A clings to Y because that's all the family she has.  She could probably use some counseling, but is her getting interested in Y's activities a bad thing?", "YTA, also getting big Stranger Things vibe off this post... \n\nFor real though, your friend basically has a kid, maybe he's the first one in your friend circle to have a big life change like this, But he won't be the last. Part of being a good friend is being there through life's chapters. Having friends with kids means you adjust to that, and you find new and different ways to hang out, like including his sister. Your friends seem to get this. You should make an effort to as well.", "Hands down YTA.", "YTA. Also it's almost impossible to find a random babysitter the day of. Babysitters will either already be booked or have their own plans.", "You have major main character vibes emanating off of you and it is super obvious that you haven't considered that... you were invited... to A's home.

I think you need to do some self reflection.  I don't necessarily think you are intentionally being an AH (although you are, don't get me wrong) I just think you haven't thought of how your actions and reactions to things affect those around you.  \n\nYTA.  talk to V. Apologize.  And maybe instead of being an asshole about A being there next time, teach her about D & D.  Kids have endless creativity and imagination.
