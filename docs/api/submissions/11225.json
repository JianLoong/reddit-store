I'm just very unimpressed by their regular stunts so I am actually very surprised and angered by this.\n\nI went on to demand a full repay of the book from them and reported it to the dean. They apologize and offered to fixed it for me(basically taping it back in) and pay me around 15 for the damages but I'm not happy. The girls are with me but they make up less than a quarter of the class so the majority of the class are backing the guys and telling me to not be an asshole and just give in.

Apparently they did do it on purpose but it was targeted at another girl they had a problem with. She has the same Chinese surname as me so they mistook my book for hers.

If you bought the book for 145 and you haven\u2019t done anything to significantly lower it\u2019s value then no. That\u2019s what they pay. If you want to be \u201cnice\u201d tell them to pay for the resell value, so 80$.

I'm guessing this specific group of students know how to get the adults on their side so they never have to face consequences. \n\nCollege kids should know better then to cut up the property of someone else. Can they do this when they get a career? Can they cut up the Dean's books? I would take this further. They at least need to fix it and pay the $80 that you would receive from the book. They also should not be in that class anymore since they clearly cannot handle the other students.", "NTA and the other girl doesn't deserve that crap too. They pay the full $145 so you can get a new one simple as that.   \n\n\nThe dean is an idiot as well. IMHO would he be ok if I go and cut apart his paperwork? But oops I'm a broke student, here I'll tape it back for you instead. Hell no.", "NTA and I hope you get it resolved to your satisfaction, but I really want to know WHY in the hell they would even do that?", "145 or bust.", "They are broke college kids? So are you and you needed to be able to resell the book when you were done with it to afford new books for new classes. \n\nYou are entitled to a book in equally good condition as your book before they destroyed it. They can either pay you the depreciation value difference or take the one they damaged and buy you a book that was in equally good condition. \n\nSo if the great condition book you had would have been worth $100, and now it's only worth $15, they can either give you $85 difference or they can give you the $100 and take the damaged $15 book.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You should have expected them to apologise, repair it, offer a suitable amount for your inconvenience, and pay you the difference between what you would reasonably expect to sell it for before and after this incident (which might be the full $80). All in that might end up more or less than the price you paid for the book, and they might be better off agreeing to pay you the retail cost and take your old book themselves, but because the book still has utility you can not expect them to repay you the full retail price.\n\nAlso, because you have now escalated this to an authority I say you are bound to accept their decision or appeal to a yet higher authority (ie the courts) and have lost your opportunity to expect the transgressor to attempt informal resolution with you.", "NTA, for wanting to get repaid for the damage they did to your textbook.\n\nHowever, you should acknowledge that continuously demanding to be repaid isn't going to work.  Complain to a school admin.  If you know their parent's contact info, complain to them.  You need to do something else if you are going to get made whole again.\n\nDon't keep doing what doesn't work.", "Would be a good argument \ud83e\udd23", "I was thinking the same thing. While he did find the \"main culprit\" he doesn't want to meddle to much and get this settled and done with. His usually a really sweet old man if you ask him for help academic wise, changed my B to an A. But his infamously bad for handling interpersonal relationships cause his quite a soft man", "In the update, OP says they did it to mess with another student, mistaking OP's book as her's. OP plans to warn the girl now. They plan to pay OP back, but are still in the wrong of course.", "The guy obviously needed a textbook. Well, now he can buy it off OP while she goes and buys a new one with the money he gives her.

She should push this to the limit. Do those boys think this is kindergarten. Dean needs fired.", "1. Looking at the school forum, 80 is minimum. I've taken good care of the book. I've had it wrapped, used transparent post i notes and not a single scribble on it. It can fetch way higher than the 80.\n\n2. No one was going to admit it till after I report it. While I knew it was that group I had no idea who the individual was. I only got an apology email from the individual afterwards with the dean getting a carbon copy.  Alot of the convincing took place informally in group chat after the email was sent.\n\n3. I do expect them to pay full price since this was an action done by full grown adults on purpose. The only reason why I'm second doubting is cause of the financial situation most of us are in and I can empathize the blow a $145 dollars can do to their wallet. That's my whole month budget on food.", "yeah, no - keep escalating this up the chain. keep bringing this up because now this is racism on top of sexism.", "I'd expect them to make it right by bringing me back  to the exact same position I was in if they didn't crack my screen, including recompense for my inconvenience. I would not expect that that puts me in a position to demand they pay me the full retail cost of the phone.", "I'll say the same thing then, your time and inconvenience sounds considerable and I'd expect all in they are looking at >$145 to settle this matter. Its quite a serious (possibly criminal) matter to damage somebody's property like that. You can offer to settle the matter for whatever you like but aren't in a position to demand they accept that offer. If you can't come to terms your recourse is surely to the courts.\n\nDepending on the rules of your institution you should be careful now that the Dean has been involved. If you continue persue it with the people who cut up your book instead of making a small claim they might accuse you of harassment.", "Ok so I'm not sure about sexism but this is definitely not racism. I'm in a Chinese dominated country. Also if I were to do the same thing as a girl right now. He would probably react the same.", ">I'd expect them to make it right by bringing me back to the exact same position I was in if they didn't crack my screen\n\nWhich would mean either having the screen professionally replaced or replacing the phone itself with one that was in at least a good a condition as your original phone. Plus your inconvenience fee. Taping the pages back together is NOT \"the exact same position\" just like taping up a cracked screen is not. The only way to make her whole is to replace the book with one in the same condition or better than the one they vandalized. I'm sure OP would be more than happy with this outcome.", "oh, my apologies - misunderstood the context of your update. guess it's a silver lining that it's just people being general assholes instead of specfically motivated ones?? best of luck to you and the other girl dealing with this nonsense going forward then", "She didn't say replace, she said she was considering demanding they pay her the original cost of the book, which would mean she has *both* the damaged book and the money to buy a brand new one.\n\nI think it's right to demand someone makes things right, and negotiate with them the specific remedy (with recourse to the courts if you can't come to terms): not to demand they do something specific  that might be putting you in a more favourable position than if it had never happened.", "Yeah my bad. Just that Chinese have reoccurring surname so it makes more sense.", "There is no way to \"fix\" her current textbook to a condition that is comparable to its original condition, so the only reasonable recourse is to buy a new book that was in a similar condition to its original. So lets use some real numbers here to make things really easy.\n\nI imagine things haven't changed too much since I was in college; getting a used book in near-mint condition wasn't all that different in cost from a new textbook, I'd say maybe 20% cheaper. So for a $150 book, that would be a cost of $120. So to \"make her whole\" the guy who vandalized her textbook should replace the book (which he's currently refusing to do) or just give her $120 to buy the book herself. Then by your own admission, you would demand an \"inconvenience fee\". I'd say $30 is a fair amount for this. So the guy should give her $150 since he's refusing to buy her a new textbook. This is not an unreasonable demand.\n\nAnd if things haven't changed too much, selling a used book would net at best less than half the original value. Going by your original proposal of \"paying the difference between the value of the book in its previous and current condition\", then the guy would only be paying her something like $40 because thats the loss in value if she tried to sell it. This would leave OP, the victim, in the negative. Its not OP's responsibility to make sure that she gains absolutely no overall benefit from her recompense.\n\nThe guy intentionally did something that was obviously wrong. For this he should both make her whole and receive a fitting punishment for doing so. Making her whole is the LEAST he should be doing, it doesn't matter if she comes out ahead because she is the victim in this case. Everybody around her is coddling the perpetrator and trying to absolve him of his responsibility and frankly its disgusting.", "I've already said I expect the costs they should expect to pay is >$145, after originally saying that accepting an offer of $145 for the damaged textbook might be a good solution, and suggested this might be a criminal matter. You are preaching to the choir.", "I'm so sorry but these conversations are so funny. I'm a student that's overworked with a part time job and broke but these comments are telling me to take it to court or bring it up the chain.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "I get you, its ridiculous that even the dean is siding with this guy. It should be a clear cut case for the school telling him to replace the book or face some kind of disciplinary action. You could always file a report with the campus police to try and force the issue. If you have an advisor, maybe bring it up with them as well. It sucks youre in this situation"]}
