I bought one and we were gonna share it. We regularly share food.\n\nWe go to my parents house to pick up our dog and chill out a bit before going home. I'm in the bathroom, and my boyfriend starts eating my donut and telling me how bad it is, stale and there's no creme in it (it's a Boston creme). I tell him that there's no way he's eating my donut right now and to stop or at least save me some.\n\nHe eats the whole donut. \n\nI get out of the bathroom and I'm kinda upset I wanted some donut tonight, he's being silly and put himself in the ''corner'' in the kitchen pretending he's there out of shame. I'm upset and ask him if he really ate it and he makes a joke and says it was so bad and not worth the calories. \n\nI just wanted a donut so I tell him that and he should save me some. (He says he apologized here but I do not remember this.) We go back into the living room and my dad is telling me drop it and that I'm overreacting for no reason. My mom is telling my boyfriend to apologize just because it obviously bothered me and that reason enough to apologize. My mom was kind of condescing towards him and the vibe got tense. \n\nI don't want to start some dumb fight over nothing and so we say our goodbyes and leave. \n\nOn the way home I ask him to apologize and he says I'm making a big deal out of nothing and hugely overreacting. I say he's gaslitting me. Were both upset. \n\nWe get home and keep talking about it in circles. I just want an apology to end it and he starts yelling that I'm being a ''five year old\" and that I \"made a scene in front of your parents\" and that I'm \"overreacting so badly he doesn't recognize me\". I'm mad cause he's \"gaslighting me into thinking I'm wrong\" and \"yelling at me for no reason\" and \"it doesn't matter if the donut was bad or not at least half of it was mine\". Anyways he yells my feelings are hurt and we go to seperate rooms and chill out for a bit. \n\nLater we talk about it a bit and both apologize, but maintain that we are in the right. \n\nSo Reddit, who right in this extremely dumb fight?\n\nWe have both reviewed this post and agree with its facts. \n\nTLDR: \nMe - mad he ate my donut because we were meant to share. Doesn't matter that it was a bad donut, it's the principle of the thing. \n\nHim - he claims he wouldn't have been mad if I ate 'the last oreo' as an example. And that I dragged it out for too long (meaning my anger cause it was just a donut.) He says that he felt singled out my by mom and that that's worst than the donut.", "created_utc": 1703393101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pnp6m/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_for_eating_my/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He ate your half of the donut. He knew you were meant to share it. He then made excuses for eating the whole thing, and then tried to blame you for overreacting.

He selfishly inhaled the whole thing. He should apologise and make up for it next time.

Donuts are tasty and I would be pissed if someone ate my donut", "NTA - The donut was bought with the intention to share, so it should\u2019ve been shared. He needs to apology and get you a new donut tbh. His \u201cisn\u2019t worth the calories\u201d comment strikes me as odd; I wonder if this was a form of him trying to control your food intake/weight?\n\nI don\u2019t think you made a scene, you just wanted an apology. He caused things to become a scene when he refused to apologize and take ownership.", "He told you it tasted bad, but he had to eat the whole donut?", "NTA OP. Your bf is in the wrong. He says he wouldn't have been mad if you \"ate the last oreo,\" but that comparison is oranges to apples as there was only one donut. His comparison makes one assume he got some oreos out of the pack before you ate the last one. You in comparison got no donuts \"out of the pack\" as there was only 1 donut.\n\nWhat he did was honestly sus behavior with the calorie comment. If your mom thought he was aiming the \"It wasn't worth the calories,\" comment at you it sounds controlling and would be a red flag. Maybe that's why she was sending out bad juju.\n\nFundamentally, you are in the right and he is in the wrong.\n\nFix: Make him buy you a donut to replace the one he ate.", "NTA. One, because he ate your food. Two, because he's the one dragging it out and trying to deny he fucked up. I don't know if this counts as gaslighting, but it is definitely a bit of DARVO.", "NTA. He needs to apologise, simple as that. Oreo cookie? Bad comparison. Next time you are planning to share the leftover pizza for dinner or last two beers, eat it all and ask him how he feels. Or the last serving of his favourite ice cream.", "NTA for being upset about the donut he selfishly ate against your agreement.\n\nE S H for drawing this out. He should have offered and you should have suggested that he stop and get you a donut on the way home from your parents. It sounds like you both would rather fight than resolve.", "NTA \n\nYou bought the donut with the intention of sharing and he just ate the whole thing. I am not understanding how he doesn\u2019t get he was wrong here.", "If someone ever had the audacity to eat my donut I  don\u2019t even know what kind of unhinged response they would receive. So sweetie don\u2019t worry you are  clearly not the asshole and I would be happy to be your boyfriend where your donuts would be safe with me.", "ESH. He shoulda just apologized to begin with, your parents shouldn't have butted in and escalated what should've been a low-stakes disagreement, you shouldn't have accused him of gaslighting you.\n\n(If he'd said, \"there was never any donut here, what are you talking about?\" or \"you already ate your share of the donut\" that would be gaslighting. Gaslighting is purposefully lying in order to make someone doubt their own memories and perception. It is not gaslighting to have different feelings, disagree on the importance of a subject, remember an event slightly differently, etc.)\n\nYour boyfriend is right that it shouldn't have turned into such a huge thing, but you're right that he shouldn't have eaten something you agreed to share and that he should've just apologized immediately once he saw you were genuinely upset. I sympathize more with you here, but of course I do when you're telling the story - it's hard to say who's more right without also getting his side.\n\nNext time you should both give each other some time to cool off before bringing it up again!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are also a bit of an AH for such an overreaction.
