How many people have you run off.", "I like to make up scenarios, and this story is missing so much info that it just screams for some creative fillings for all of the gaps. How about, OP was told a thousand times a day as a teenage know-it-all to not be an idiot and if something happens, she Should. Not. Count. On. Them. because they've done their work and they want to finally be able to enjoy their golden years a bit? How about, she was warned about not thinking that that particular boy would stick around should something happen, and she refused to listen? How about, she was offered different ways out of the situation, but she refused all of them, thinking that in the end the parents will just give in because they would *have* to help? Some ideas.", "That wasn't contempt. I just don't think it's prudent to leave your young kids in the care of people who have made it abundantly clear they don't give two shits about them.", "They are, which is why I judged this ESH. I think OP is partially TA here for calling them up and then yelling at them when they gave the exact answer she should know they were going to. And for even considering having two strangers to her children who quite clearly openly despise them look after them. OP should go NC.", "I can remember having my first ever panic attack and one of my parents' best friends being who came to pick me up from school. they were nearby and able to leave work to take me home.\n\nIt never occurred to me that anyone would considered it a big ask, my parents would've done it for their kids no question.\n\n(Their son in my grade also got to leave early cuz I think the parents' figured if I got to leave early, we both should. And I always thought that was fair.)", "/u/Electronic744 is a bot that copied part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142jic8/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_watch_my_kids_in/jn4q6qs/", "No they suck for continuing to set themselves up for disappointment", "I\u2019ve simply (and consistently) challenged the idea that any of these aspersions make OP an asshole, which is very triggering to the misogynists and anti-natalists of Reddit.\n\nI\u2019m fascinated to see where you got the idea that I don\u2019t hope that OP can disentangle herself from her parents and get the help she needs (and deserves).", "So you\u2019re committed to her being an asshole?", "And in any of those cases the grandparents would still be the assholes for refusing to even meet the kids because \u201cshe didn\u2019t listen to us, we told her THAT BOY was no good\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re done raising kids.\u201d They are involved grandparents for the grandkids in another state, but completely ignore the existence of grandkids in the same city? \n\nThey don\u2019t have to support them financially or \u201craise her kids,\u201d but completely cutting these kids out of the family is shitty. And not being willing to pick the kids up in an emergency is also shitty. If they had something else going on and COULDN\u2019T go that would be one thing, but OP is clear that her friends were working and unavailable so it seems like the grandparents didn\u2019t provide a reason.", "None of those scenarios sound plausible, if the parents were as caring and attentive as that they wouldn't be the sort of people who punish their grandkids for their mother's mistake.\n\nETA I don't even think having kids at 18 is necessarily a mistake. Everyone takes their own path.", "If you\u2019d voted any other way, I might understand. \n\nBut as far as you\u2019re concerned, OP being in a position where she felt like she only had her parents to turn to in an emergency makes her an asshole.\n\nSo it\u2019s not contempt\u2026 just a general lack of empathy and kindness, got it.", "I agree OP should go no contact... OP didn't ask for much of them and I think she snapped rightfully so because they obviously have treated her like shit for a very long time so I can't say the parents didn't deserve to be yelled at...I snapped at my narcissistic mother because all she wanted was control of my ENTIRE life so I cut her off... she gets to see my daughters but other than that I don't have a relationship with her", "Oh, so you\u2019re just an edgelord with zero empathy, got it.", "Yes, she's being an Ah to herself", "It's not \"did they deserve this\" though, I think it's pretty standard that calling someone up and yelling at someone for not doing something you request is an AH move, especially when you know what that answer is going to be. I get it, it is a shitty situation, but OP really shouldn't have deluded themselves into thinking this was going to be a yes, and should not have called.", "If OP keeps kicking a brick wall, complaining about a broken foot, then kicking the wall again, does OP need empathy, or a reality check?\n\nOP has known for SIX YEARS that her grandparents aren't going to help.  So why keep kicking that brick wall?  Why not find other people that she can call on in an emergency?", "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have empathy the reality is OP is 24 years old with no support system which is devastating but at the same time she knows by now that her parents aren\u2019t going to help\n\nShe is doing herself a disservice and is continuing to hurt herself trying to force something that isn\u2019t going to happen", "Are you one of those \u201cYou can\u2019t expect people to love you if you don\u2019t love yourself\u2026\u201d types? \n\nI think you\u2019ve stumbled onto your own ethics quandary and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re qualified to weigh in here.", "They DID deserve it though jeez... they are shitty parents ... if I asked my dad to pick up my daughter he would in a heart beat... it wasn't like she was asking for the world ffs... if the parents didn't want grandchildren why have children in the first place?", "You wrote SIX YEARS in all caps. Is that amount specifically referenced in the \u201cHow to Recover from Being Unloved by Your Parents\u201d manual? Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s relevant.", "I agree with the above comments that OP needs to build a support system without her parents or her sister. I feel like it's kinda a separate issue but if the grandparents act this different towards her sister's kids I would not LET them have contact with my children becauase the kids will start to wonder why grandma & grandpa don't love them. Hell, I'd be going very low contact with the parents and the sister.\n\nI'm going with ESH for this because OP is mainly being the A to herself. My mom's family is abusive. My 2 aunts kept breaking off and then running back to their abusive Mom. It's hard to realize you are never going to have the relationship you want OP, especially with a parent, but for your sake and your kid's sake this is something you need to accept and work/move around. Wishing you strength.", "And yet that still doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have empathy, I just don\u2019t have empathy, you know?\u201d\n\nK.", "I'm not sure what I think triggers you so much, might want to work on that...", "Again that's not the purpose of this sub or my judgement.

Nothing?", "It\u2019s definitely something she should do, but it doesn\u2019t happen overnight and it doesn\u2019t often happen without therapy.

In 6 years she should have made one friend who can get her kids.\n\nThat has nothing to do with healing from her parents.", "Just because it\u2019s a long and arduous journey of grief that doesn\u2019t make anything I said false\n\nShe has two kids she needs people around her that actually love and care about her", "Letting go of your parents is the hardest thing.
