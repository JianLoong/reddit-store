They have made it clear they will never, ever help. \n\nYou definitely need to find other mothers or sitters in case of emergency. What about other mothers at the daycare? You can also trade off afternoons or evenings every so often when one of you needs a break, run errands, a nap, whatever.", "ESH. While your parents are absolute massive AHs, I don't know why you keep trying with them. They aren't under any obligation to help and they've shown you they aren't willing to try. You should just go NC with them instead of putting yourself in situation where you'll be let down.", "Why do you even have contact with them? They are obviously playing favorites at this point and don\u2019t deserve your time. I am sorry that they aren\u2019t supportive.\n\nNTA for asking. However, you should have hung up immediately and tried someone else or for an emergency extension from your daycare.", "NTA, but I am questioning why your mother is the first you call when you know she disapproves. Do you have no other backup plan?", "NTA. But you shouldn't be surprised. These people treat you like trash.  Why do you interact with them, at all?", "Wow. They are not nice at all. Taking it out on kids because you had one at 18. NTA. I would not be in contact with them at all. If they want nothing to do with my kids, they want nothing to do with me.", "Free baby sitters is not helping your child when they need it.  Your parents are real A hs. Would they even care if someone or something bad happened while you were late. I would just cut all ties with them they really could give two shits less about you and your kids. Ntah", "Eww. You still talk to your parents?! You should disown those evil fucks. Who treats their own children this way. Literally disgusting.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has probably benefitted from a lot of free babysitting over the years so it's easy for her to scoff at you. Make sure you have a good network of friends around you who can help each other out", "NTA but now you know not to ask them for anything at all. Your sister is one to talk. She\u2019s getting free babysitters and her children are getting the full grandparents experience. I think it\u2019s despicable that your parents would punish you and your children over something so silly. You really need to have some self respect and stop trying to give a relationship with these people. They sound absolutely heartless.", "Wow. They are not nice at all. Taking it out on kids because you had one at 18. NTA. I would not be in contact with them at all. If they want nothing to do with my kids, they want nothing to do with me.", "No they are not free babysitter s but they're not grandparents in any traditional sense of the word either. I would feel free to not waste another minute with them.", "INFO Why would you call them if they\u2019ve made clear for six years straight that they wouldn\u2019t help you? Why not seek a better support system rather than keep pulling a death horse? You knew from the very start they aren\u2019t willing to help.", "NTA but the harsh reality here is that THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU AND NEVER WILL and you now need to find alternative methods. You know it\u2019s off the table, so rather than continuing to ask them for help with the kids that you KNOW you won\u2019t receive, you wre responsible for looking for a backup incase an emergency like this happens again.", "NTA for wanting it but at this point it\u2019s not worth the mental and emotional toll it\u2019s taking on you. They cut you off when you needed them and it looks like that\u2019s how it\u2019ll stay. Save yourself the heartache and build your own chosen family \ud83d\udda4", "NTA. You're being held to a cruel double standard at this point and they long ago should have let their unhappiness about your young pregnancy go. They seem shockingly cold and callous; I am sure you must dread when your kids get to the age that they notice being rejected by their grandparents. \n\nAt this point I'd really back away from them. Firstly it's clear you can't count on them for anything, they're too busy still making their point. What that means though is that, while sad for you, they don't deserve to be in your or your kids' lives at this point.", "NTA\n\nIt was an emergency. Forget the money when you get a flat tire it could take a bit, the best thing was for someone to pick up your kids. \n\nYour parents sound insufferable. Honestly I wouldn't have a relationship with them. Punishing your children for choices you made they don't approve of is absolutely disgusting.", "I\u2019d go NTA here. They aren\u2019t expecting child care effectively it seemed like they wanted someone to drive over, pick up the kids from daycare and drop them off at home, or meet at another location closebye. Its not like OP was asking them to drop everything and watch them for a whole day it was \u2018hey i can\u2019t get there and i\u2019m going to be charged through the nose if I don\u2019t pick them up in time help me out for like an hour?\u2019 (It could be less too, they just have to change the tire.)", "NTA- wow. so they will happily punish kids because you dared to have a kid at 18.", "YTA \n\nWhy would you leave your kids in the care of people who don't care about them at all?", "NTA\n\nUgh, as a grandma to a baby my daughter had young, this kills me. Young single moms need MORE love, help, and support,  not less. You and your kids deserve better. Sorry they suck.  I would cut off my right arm before I would leave my daughter and her kids stranded in an emergency. You are 100% correct, your mother is an ass.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThere's certainly a whole lot of backstory in this, and/or your parents and sibling are some kind of awful people. \n\nThat being the case, why are you continuing to subject your children to your garbage family?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I think you need to cut them off. Don\u2019t talk to them at all. Completely remove them from your lives. It will be incredibly damaging to your children to grow up with grandparents who are involved with and loving towards their cousins but hate them simply because you had them at an age THEY didn\u2019t approve of.

You for keeping these people in your life.", "NTA. Wow there is no telling who is the favourite child, I feel sorry for you. They obviously haven\u2019t let the fact you had a child young go and are punishing you and your children for it. I would sit down and really question about whether I\u2019d want them in my life going forward.", "ESH. Your parents clearly suck, but you wanted your kids to be in the care of mean strangers who hate them and that's not okay either", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry your parents dont like your kids but that's the reality of the situation. They're off the table for help. You might as well call Michael Jordan or Neil Armstrong, cause those two have shown as much interest in helping you out as your parents have (that's to say, none)\n\nIts not fair to your kids to be hopeful that your parents will change. Its not in the cards so have a different backup plan cause if you hope that your parents will suddenly change, you're being naive and not planning for an emergency correctly (as again, your parents are not an option)\n\nQuick question....and this may be insensitive but I need to know. When you found yourself pregnant at 18, did your parents straight up tell you to end the pregnancy/give up the child or deal with all the parenting alone? Cause I'm getting those vibes and if so, I'm sorry, you signed up for this and more", "YTA/ESH. You said it yourself it was clear for 6 years they wouldn't help. I'm willing to bet there's more being left out to skew judgement, but your sister is right they aren't babysitters.", "ESH. They are punishing children, which isn't cool but they ARE being consistent so I have no idea why you felt you were owed their help and insulted them for doing what they literally told you they would do. You chose to have kids even knowing that your parents straight up told you that if you did you'd be on your own, so that's your issue to figure out. I don't even know why you're still in contact with them.", "ESH if this had been people who were actually involved in your kids or just nice then absolutely Nta but they clearly take their \u201cmoral\u201d judgement of you out on your kids.

Your parents for being judge mental jerks and you for not having a backup plan for your kids. ALWAYS have a good friend or acquaintance as your emergency contact or on call for these situations if you know your parents do t want to help you.", "OP it looks like your parents plan to punish you forever for what (in their eyes) was a mistake you made at 18. Don\u2019t ruin your life by trying to include your parents in it. When you look at your children do you see mistakes? NTA", "ESH.  You created a difficult situation for yourself and your parents don't want to suffer inconveniences as a result of your poor choices.

OP, you can want all day long and it won't change your parents. Accept that they aren't good grandparents to your kids (and if they are as distant as you say why would you even want to have them around your kids when you're not there?) and build your network. It's hard to do but not impossible. My parents live several hours away so even though they would gladly help, I can't call them for a situation like that. I've got friends and neighbors that I call on and I do the same for their kids.", "Don\u2019t agree with ESH. Based on OPs comments in another reply, the child\u2019s father is absent and the sister lives in another state and there\u2019s no one else to help. \n\nI can\u2019t understand why the GParents take it out on the child.

From the line about OP having the kid at 18, I think it's more of a \"parents are awful\" scenario or religious nuts scenario.\n\nIf that's the case, OP you should cut your losses and cut your parents off and live your life without any expectations from them. \n\nYou'll only end up hurting your kids in the long run if you stay for your parents' approval.", "They told me since I am an adult the choice was mine but they would not help.

Your children will be a constant sacrifice so this is par for the course.", "This is an insane take. You\u2019re talking about a family.
