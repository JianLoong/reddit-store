Everyone else gets to choose. \n\nFinally, I'll point out that \"I have a flat tire and I'll have to pay extra money if I'm late\" is not a genuine emergency. \"I have to take child A to the hospital urgently, and somebody needs to look after child B\" is an emergency. I might be a bit more sympathetic to trying to shove an unwilling grandparent into a duty they already told you they were not willing to do, if it really *was* an emergency and there was nobody else -- it's still not their job, but everyone should step in to keep somebody from dying, out of simple humanity -- but nobody needs to take on a job they have no duty to do and have announced that they *won't* do, just to save somebody else some cash.", "Sure, it's fair when speaking about the general terms of having a kid. But not helping out in an emergency, whatsoever? Thats just plain psycho behaviour. That doesn't teach anything to anyone, that's just being an asshole. They're punishing those kids because they hate his daughter, plain and simple.", "I was thinking that last paragraph too, but wasn\u2019t sure if  I was too harsh. I can imagine if they\u2019re struggling that the daycare fines could make or break OP\u2019s monthX that being said, grandparents have never been a childcare option, so OP needs to have other backup at times like this.", "It makes it difficult but not impossible if you actually try. My mom was a single mom, and she managed to figure it out. I will admit that she did have some help from my grandfather, but not much considering he was also working a full-time job, and it wasn't his responsibility.\nMy mom figured it out. She found babysitters, she made friends at work. She did whatever she had to do to make it work, because she didn't really have much of anyway in choices.\n\nShe has had 6 years to try and make at least one friend at work even, there's the internet which allows you to search for babysitters online, allows you to do background checks. There's websites devoted to finding child care services.\nSometimes you can even find babysitters that are willing to work with you on a budget. Hell, there could be teenagers around her neighborhood that need extra money to do things with her friends that I'm sure she could probably find.\n\nBut if you consistently keep asking the same person for 6 years to help you, after they've done nothing but say no to you that entire time, then you are in fact just setting yourself up for disappointment. At that point, you know it's going to end in an argument, or with somebody being mad, and you're choosing to do it anyways. That does nothing to help you"]}
