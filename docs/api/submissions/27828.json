{"id": 27828, "submission_id": "16up7c8", "title": "AITA for splitting the bill at dinner?", "selftext": "So I recently moved away for school, away from my family and friends. A few weeks ago, my friends from home came to visit me because their school had a long weekend or something like that. So they rented out a Airbnb near my school and we hung out a lot during that weekend. But their last night here, before they were gonna go back, was when this whole thing happened.\n\nOK, so a little context: I don't have any problems with money whatsoever, in fact I even chipped in for their Airbnb payment because they asked me for help prior. Only one of my friends works, so they're all trying to be \"frugal\" on this trip, which I completely understand. However, this night at dinner, they all decided they wanted to go this really fancy restaurant. I'd never been there but I heard it was a nice place, so I skipped out on lunch to really indulge in the food there.\n\nSo we arrive there and immediately my friends are saying how they're \"only gonna order appetizers and drinks\" because the mains were quite expensive, around 30-40 and higher. Then I tell them I'm gonna order a lot of stuff, because I had barely ate that day. I ended up getting a ribeye ($78) and 3 appetizers, fries ($12), mac and cheese ($16) and a cheese board ($20). I specifically said that we could share the CHEESE BOARD because I didn't think I could finish it all. Just the cheese board, that's important.\n\nAl my friends order an appetizer or starter each for themselves, and when the food comes out, they finish theirs quite quick. I took my time working on my steak, but then they all started eating the appetizers I had ordered. I barely had a quarter of my mac and cheese left, and I think I got like 8 fries. They didn't even give me any of the cheese from the cheese board because, and I quote, \"the mac and cheese had cheese in it already.\" Huh? \n\nMind you, they had also ordered drinks for themselves which were around $15 each. So at this point I was getting upset already. The waitress comes and asks if we're splitting the bill, and before any of them could answer, I said to split the appetizers amongst all 4 of us. After the waitress left, I could tell the vibe had shifted. They were no longer joking around much, and the conversation seemed a bit strained.\n\nWe still said goodbye to each other in a friendly manner, but as the weeks go by after they left, I noticed my friends had stopped contacting me as much as they used to. I texted one of them that I was closest to and they told me that they were kind of pissed that I split the appetizers that I had ordered, when they specifically said they didn't wanna spend that much. So that kinda made me feel bad because I didn't mean for there to be any conflict during their trip here, as they came all the way to see me, and now I'm thinking I should've just paid for it.

I think it would have looked REALLY bad to say to your financially limited friends at a nice restaurant that you want to order more food than all the rest of them put together and eat all of it yourself, even if you were sharing one other thing.  (And I'll note - you didn't say anything about them eating food that was supposedly for you, AND you don't say that you ordered - or considered ordering - more food, because so much of yours was eaten by your friends.)\n\nSo I think you created a circumstance where your friends believed they were being treated to some nice food, and then surprised them by telling the waitress that bill was to be shared.  \n\nThat said, even GIVEN this interpretation your friends were rude.  Even with an understandable impression that they were being treated, they should have clarified before eating any of the food if it wasn't crystal clear, AND they should have thanked you even before the food arrived, AND they should not have eaten every bite of any of the things you were supposedly generously providing to the table.  And given that they did none of those things, they should have taken your telling the waitress to split the bill as a moment to realize they had misunderstood - and they should have been gracious about it, because even if you do treat them to anything they should not take it for granted or hold it against you if you put limits on that kind of thing.", "Sorry, but I do think you were an asshole to order a huge meal when they only planned to order appetizers and drinks in order to save money.

I was originally going with E-S-H but as I was breaking down my response, I realized that while I think some responsibility, your friends were taking advantage of you.\n\nThe mild AH thing for you is communication from the beginning. You ordered a lot of food while they only ordered appetizers and drinks. That meant they would've been sitting around, waiting for you to finish your meal. Your friends should've let you know prior to this that they were only going to eat appetizers and have drinks. I think it would've been better if you did something similar or at least checked whether they were okay with that.\n\nYour friends were AHs for not letting you have much of your food. You should've spoken up and said something about splitting the bill once you saw what was happening. $12/person doesn't seem like a lot to many people, but it could be. Then again, if they were broke, they shouldn't have picked such a pricey place.

I have friends who take me out to dinner and I always confirm with them what I'm expected to contribute even though it's always the same.", "ESH simply for the lack of communication. Your friends went out of their way to come visit YOU. You knew that only one of them works. You knew that they had asked you to pitch in for their lodgings. They made it obvious that they were ordering lightly, while you made it obvious that you were splurging. Any one of you could have cleared this whole thing up right then and there. If I was one of your friends, and I had said I was ordering one drink and one cheap entree or an appetizer, I\u2019d have said \u201cOP, are you buying for everyone?

Plus you should have chosen a cheaper place knowing full well that they were broke.", "Yes, YTA. You should have just told them a) don't eat my fucking f*east* (because that's what it is by the way, a feast) or b) asked to split it, instead of just assuming. Maybe it would've went over better.   \n\n\nI will say, I fucking HATE when ppl are \"on a budget\", then suggest going somewhere expensive and only get appetizers.

The fancy restaurant makes you order sides separately and lists them as \u201cappetizers\u201d even though the serving size is paltry. So you got a steak with two sides- fries and mac and cheese.

They wanted to do appetizers and a drink, that\u2019s still a nice night.\n\nThe OP decided not to eat all day and then order a huge amount of food compared to them.  \n\nDid they expect them to just sit there and watch for 30 minutes?", "hmmm... I don't think OP is the cheap one in this situation. it's not even about being technically correct, what kind of friends just expect you to pay for the food you all shared? and being pissed off about it? weird friendship they have", "I disagree. There are definitely similar scenarios where I would agree, but there's a difference between picking your battles and being a doormat.\n\nThey chose a fancy restaurant knowing they didn't have much money, and then complained that they couldn't afford an entree. Feels like they were fishing for OP to pick up the bill, especially after they ate food that wasn't offered to them and are now freezing OP out over it.", "It's not about being cheap or technically correct but about OP friends being inconsiderate AH towards OP, eating what OP ordered, leaving next to nothing and make it look like it was OP fault they had to spend money after they ate what was ordered.", "It doesn't sound like it cost OP any friends. What kind of friend treats food like theirs when they're eating and like yours when it's time to pay? They are willing to lose a friend over appetizers they didn't need to eat. They could have gone someplace cheaper, or filled up on food at home before going out for just an app and a drink, or spent their $15 drink budget on their $12 share of the appetizers, or just talked about it ahead of time.", "Obviously, that\u2019s not a problem because those aren\u2019t \u201cfriends\u201d else they would understand. Or if they don\u2019t, at least talk to him why they\u2019re upset and not just break contact.\n\nThey\u2019re children, that misbehaved and are now salty on OP because they did something wrong and it didn\u2019t went well.\n\nAdditionally, I think it\u2019s already weird to pick an expensive restaurant and then only eat appetizers instead of going to a cheaper place and getting enough to eat. Especially when trying to be \u201cfrugal\u201d. It really bugs me out and in combination with the other things happening your friends give off a really weird vibe. Either they expected you to pay, they hoped to get some leftovers or they just went there so they can be \u201ccool\u201d and tell others they were there. They\u2019re choosing a place outside what they can afford. Honestly either of those options gives me the ick.", "This is the right answer.  Honestly, if I had savored my steak while they shared French fries and small appetizers among them, I just would let it ride.  Not that anyone is obligated to do this, but I just wouldn\u2019t get twisted up over it because at the end of the day, all they got were some measly appetizers, and I still had my wonderful steak.  It\u2019s just not worth it to get twisted up over the 28 bucks.", "This is the nuance that some redditors don't get.  Weighing the pros and cons of an action even if you're technically right.", "It probably was worth it. Free up the OP to make friends that don't eat all the food.", "OP also helped pay for their air bnb. The \"friends\" shouldn't have chosen somewhere they couldn't afford, and they shouldn't have stolen OPs food and then expected OP to pay for it when OP already covered some of the cost of their air bnb. It absolutely does matter that they're NTA, and nobody deserves selfish entitled friends who try and take advantage.", "This... this answer right here \u261d\u261d\u261d\u261d  They made an effort to come up and see you, they are students hurting for money, but it sounds like financially your better off.  Wanted last meal to be special but really couldn't afford it.  Also ordering that many appetizers usually means you are sharing it with table.  But keep that $36 in your pocket if it makes you feel better. Kinda TA", "They actually never \u201csat and watched me eat,\u201d because we were all talking the whole time (even after they had finished first) and like i said in my post they ordered more drinks after they finished eating. Sorry if that wasn\u2019t clear", "Because it's rude to be the only person at the table ordering a main dish to begin with. OP created a weird situation from the start. OP is not \"obligated\" to pay but if you're gonna be a dick during the meal, the nice thing to do is pay a little more.", "All I know is that if I go to a restaurant and order food that isn't meant to be shared, it wouldn't be shared - or at least I would get the majority of it. (\"hand me your plate and I'll give you a few fries.\")  I would use my big boy words and tell everybody to enjoy the cheese plate.\n\nBasically, I don't think OP is a reliable narrator. I don't think they were as clear with their intentions as they think.", "I got it and I agree", "Yeah, I have binge eating disorder and even I cannot pack away an entire steak (and sides?) and three appetizers on top of that.", "after he already paid for their room. do not take a trip you can\u2019t afford, it\u2019s common sense. their all pretty big jerks but i do not agree he\u2019s at fault for eating dinner after skipping lunch knowing they picked a expensive place.", "i do agree with that. well explained thank you. originally i didn\u2019t see it like that. but i can\u2019t even eat a whole app side salad and entree. half of that sucker usually goes home with me in a box, i share with my dog on the sofa \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f after we are alone \ud83d\ude06", "I agree with you, except for one caveat: \n\n>food you all shared\n\nThey didn't seem to share the appetizers, just wolfed them down and expected OP to pick up their tab.", "OP could\u2019ve told them not to eat the apps, but he chose to let them eat what he\u2019d ordered, leading them to believe they were for the table. Of course they thought that- who orders *three* apps all for themselves on top of an entree w/ sides?", "What kind of friend expects their friends who ordered light to just sit there as they eat four times the amount of food they ordered?", "If you can\u2019t afford to eat out at an expensive place don\u2019t CHOOSE it. OP didn\u2019t suggest the place,  the friends did. Are you one of those friends?", "It's not rude at all.\n\nOp isn't obligated to forgo a main meal because others are, especially when they chose a restraunt they knew they couldn't afford.\n\nDespite that, OP still offered to share appetizers. Thats the exact opposite of rude; its pretty gracious. If you want to point fingers and scream \"RUDE!\", youre overlooking the friends who took advantage of OP by eating all her appetizers AND expected her to pay for them.\n\nWhat are you expecting here? That OP continues to go hungry because she can't order a main meal while her friends eat all her appetizers, and have the nerve to expect her to pay on top?\n\nThe  not-so-friends cleary took advantage of her here for nice food.\n\nAbsolutely butt-backwards to call OP the rude one here lol.", "It really isnt ride.  It's a restaurant eat whatever you want and pay for what you eat. \n\nFriends are moochers in this scenario. The nice thing to do is not scoff down someone else's food.", "OP's friends chose the expensive restaurant, and didn't announce until they were there they were only ordering starters. If you can't afford to eat at an expensive place, don't choose it. OP didn't create the weird situation, the friends did. She paid a little more, she paid for her steak.", "What he has and hasn't paid for is irrelevant. When they only ordered a small app, he could've still ordered an entree and not been weird. Expecting people to sit and watch you eat four plates of food while the rest of the table ordered one is rude. Period. Eating four plates of food is not a normal dinner anyways? That's getting into \"I ate the whole party sub\" type of weirdness.", "You reminded me of a story my mother told me years ago. This was back when it was not so socially acceptable to ask if they could take home their uneaten food, so people would ask for doggie bags. \n\nSo her friend asked the waiter if he would pack up the rest of her steak for her dog. To her dismay (she didn't have a dog) the waiter scraped all the steak off several plates for her to take home to her non existent dog.", "Op didn\u2019t offer to share appetizers.  They offered to share ONE appetizer\u2014the cheeseboard.", "I love that everyone calling OP rude is ignoring the fact they already helped their friends with covering the cost of the Airbnb. I'm sorry but if I help pay your accommodation and then you EAT MY FRIES , we have a problem, my friend.", "\ud83d\ude02 this is great thanks for the laugh i promise i have a  old cripple dog i share with. \ud83e\udd23"]}
