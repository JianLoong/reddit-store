{"id": 27828, "submission_id": "16up7c8", "title": "AITA for splitting the bill at dinner?", "selftext": "So I recently moved away for school, away from my family and friends. A few weeks ago, my friends from home came to visit me because their school had a long weekend or something like that. So they rented out a Airbnb near my school and we hung out a lot during that weekend. But their last night here, before they were gonna go back, was when this whole thing happened.\n\nOK, so a little context: I don't have any problems with money whatsoever, in fact I even chipped in for their Airbnb payment because they asked me for help prior. Only one of my friends works, so they're all trying to be \"frugal\" on this trip, which I completely understand. However, this night at dinner, they all decided they wanted to go this really fancy restaurant. I'd never been there but I heard it was a nice place, so I skipped out on lunch to really indulge in the food there.\n\nSo we arrive there and immediately my friends are saying how they're \"only gonna order appetizers and drinks\" because the mains were quite expensive, around 30-40 and higher. Then I tell them I'm gonna order a lot of stuff, because I had barely ate that day. I ended up getting a ribeye ($78) and 3 appetizers, fries ($12), mac and cheese ($16) and a cheese board ($20). I specifically said that we could share the CHEESE BOARD because I didn't think I could finish it all. Just the cheese board, that's important.\n\nAl my friends order an appetizer or starter each for themselves, and when the food comes out, they finish theirs quite quick. I took my time working on my steak, but then they all started eating the appetizers I had ordered. I barely had a quarter of my mac and cheese left, and I think I got like 8 fries. They didn't even give me any of the cheese from the cheese board because, and I quote, \"the mac and cheese had cheese in it already.\" Huh? \n\nMind you, they had also ordered drinks for themselves which were around $15 each. So at this point I was getting upset already. The waitress comes and asks if we're splitting the bill, and before any of them could answer, I said to split the appetizers amongst all 4 of us. After the waitress left, I could tell the vibe had shifted. They were no longer joking around much, and the conversation seemed a bit strained.\n\nWe still said goodbye to each other in a friendly manner, but as the weeks go by after they left, I noticed my friends had stopped contacting me as much as they used to. I texted one of them that I was closest to and they told me that they were kind of pissed that I split the appetizers that I had ordered, when they specifically said they didn't wanna spend that much. So that kinda made me feel bad because I didn't mean for there to be any conflict during their trip here, as they came all the way to see me, and now I'm thinking I should've just paid for it.

I think it would have looked REALLY bad to say to your financially limited friends at a nice restaurant that you want to order more food than all the rest of them put together and eat all of it yourself, even if you were sharing one other thing.  (And I'll note - you didn't say anything about them eating food that was supposedly for you, AND you don't say that you ordered - or considered ordering - more food, because so much of yours was eaten by your friends.)\n\nSo I think you created a circumstance where your friends believed they were being treated to some nice food, and then surprised them by telling the waitress that bill was to be shared.  \n\nThat said, even GIVEN this interpretation your friends were rude.  Even with an understandable impression that they were being treated, they should have clarified before eating any of the food if it wasn't crystal clear, AND they should have thanked you even before the food arrived, AND they should not have eaten every bite of any of the things you were supposedly generously providing to the table.  And given that they did none of those things, they should have taken your telling the waitress to split the bill as a moment to realize they had misunderstood - and they should have been gracious about it, because even if you do treat them to anything they should not take it for granted or hold it against you if you put limits on that kind of thing.", "Sorry, but I do think you were an asshole to order a huge meal when they only planned to order appetizers and drinks in order to save money.

I was originally going with E-S-H but as I was breaking down my response, I realized that while I think some responsibility, your friends were taking advantage of you.\n\nThe mild AH thing for you is communication from the beginning. You ordered a lot of food while they only ordered appetizers and drinks. That meant they would've been sitting around, waiting for you to finish your meal. Your friends should've let you know prior to this that they were only going to eat appetizers and have drinks. I think it would've been better if you did something similar or at least checked whether they were okay with that.\n\nYour friends were AHs for not letting you have much of your food. You should've spoken up and said something about splitting the bill once you saw what was happening. $12/person doesn't seem like a lot to many people, but it could be. Then again, if they were broke, they shouldn't have picked such a pricey place.

I have friends who take me out to dinner and I always confirm with them what I'm expected to contribute even though it's always the same.", "ESH simply for the lack of communication. Your friends went out of their way to come visit YOU. You knew that only one of them works. You knew that they had asked you to pitch in for their lodgings. They made it obvious that they were ordering lightly, while you made it obvious that you were splurging. Any one of you could have cleared this whole thing up right then and there. If I was one of your friends, and I had said I was ordering one drink and one cheap entree or an appetizer, I\u2019d have said \u201cOP, are you buying for everyone?

Plus you should have chosen a cheaper place knowing full well that they were broke.", "Yes, YTA. You should have just told them a) don't eat my fucking f*east* (because that's what it is by the way, a feast) or b) asked to split it, instead of just assuming.

The fancy restaurant makes you order sides separately and lists them as \u201cappetizers\u201d even though the serving size is paltry. So you got a steak with two sides- fries and mac and cheese.

Rachel got the side salad.", "I mean, the friends said that they were ordering lightly so maybe OP could have *not* ordered quote as much for themselves - how slowly does everyone else need to sip their drinks and nibble their appetizers while OP eats their 4+course meal. It's not even like this famous fancy restaurant has amazing unique fries and Mac n cheese that can't be missed. Yeah they're crappy for helping themselves to the food and then not expecting to kick in for it, but there's a tiny bit of blame on OP for not thinking that through", "I\u2019m not sure that it wasn\u2019t clear, as I think the norm is to order food for yourself and pay for it yourself when eating with friends.  I know when I go out with my closest friends, that\u2019s how it is and if we split anything it is discussed explicitly so there is no confusion.\n\nBut OP does seem to be a bit of a glutton and a dick for ordering so much to eat for themselves to eat in front of everyone like that.  I mean, who does that?  I mean, it is fine to get dessert, but they had so much food.  How long did they expect their friends to sit there and watch them eat?", "Each \ud83d\ude0f", "No I didn\u2019t really communicate with them about why, and I mean that\u2019s probably the fault on my part. I\u2019m not selfish, if someone grabs a fry or two from me I won\u2019t say a word, but they ate more of my appetizers than I did which is why I said to split the bill, and probably what I should\u2019ve explained", "Did you try calling her \u201cBig Mama?\u201d", "From the looks of it, people who don't have a problem with money have problems with manners too.", "Oh sorry, i\u2019ve never watched that show..", "Yeah, this sounds like it was a \"only one person at the table wants dessert and holds rhe whole table up while they watch one person eat their dessert\" situation except multiplied in rudeness by number of plates ordered that he expected them to watch him eat. I'll be honest, I'd say the level of rude is enough to justify a YTA over even an ESH judgment.", "> How long did they expect their friends to sit there and watch them eat?\n\nYeah, I wonder if they're more upset by realizing that was what was \"supposed\" to happen there, than by the extra $12.", "Right? Like look, I can pig out with the best of them, but a huge streak and *multiple* appetizers? Like damn, read the room.", "Except they didn't tell op they were only going to get drinks and an app\n\n\nSo he saved up his appetite bc how often do you go to an expensive restaurant? \n\n\nOp wanted to eat, while it sounds like his friends just wanted to go there for the vibe I guess?", "I SHOULD HAVE. Omg I can't stop laughing, thank you! \ud83e\udd23\n\nI know one day we're going to wish to hear one of her annoying sayings just one more time but man, in the moment I'm just like nooooooooo not again! \ud83d\ude05", "It's fine, i didn't expect anyone to get it. Lol\n\nThe point stands, you knew they were getting a small plate and you got a massive steak and three sides...\n\nIf I were you I would send heartfelt apologies, thank them for coming all the way to see you, and then maybe treat them to dinner when you're in town (doesn't have to be more than a couple of pizzas, just the gesture is what really counts)", "You can't save three apps and an entre steaks worth of appetite unless you're already a bit of a glutton...\n\nIf OP wanted, he could have still gotten an entre while they got apps and not have been weird."]}
