You sound like a total bore.", "YTA\n\nNot funny, just mean. Why are you putting down your partner?", "YTA. Degrees don't have to be judged on how much money it earns you after the fact.

Seems plucked right out your behind, whereas the statistics on my point that, \"STEM degrees are typically a better investment\" are pretty widespread , and can be seen through various data , one of which being graduate salaries from STEM degrees compared to non-STEM degrees (Although there are multiple other ways of proving this without comparing graduate salaries , it's just the first one that came to my mind.)\n\nI just don't see how your comment had any relevance to my points, honestly.", "If you read it properly, then maybe you'd understand better.
