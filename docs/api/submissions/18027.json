{"id": 18027, "submission_id": "13q1w0g", "title": "AITA for planning to have my wedding before my sisters despite her getting engaged first?", "selftext": "My sister (27F) has been engaged to her longterm partner (28M) for the past four years. Timing hasn't worked out for them with the pandemic and they're also saving up for their dream wedding with all the bells and whistles, ultimate fairy tale wedding is their goal. I (25F) have never cared much for marriage or felt it necessary so I didn't consider it on the cards for me. \n\nThings however have changed because of a very simple reason, my partner (25m) had a daughter with his Highschool girlfriend, he stuck around but the girl wasn't ready to be a parent and bailed leaving him holding the baby. We were friends in School and I stepped up to help him where needed as his family turned their backs on him, when we were 20 we started to date. I'm the only Mother his daughter has ever known and I love her like my own, he recently had a cancer scare which thankfully turned out to be nothing but it made us sit down and think about some things. Finally I suggested we just get married as he doesn't want his family getting his daughter if anything happened to him and his ex girlfriends side play no part in the daughters life either. We decided we'll get married in 2 weeks time at the courthouse and sent messages to my family and our friends to let them know in case anyone wants to be there.\n\nOverall everyone is supportive, we don't want a big fuss made over us we don't even have rings yet and aren't sure we'll get them, though my parents insist on taking us out for dinner after, the problem is my sister however who is upset that i'm planning to get married before her when I've only been engaged a short time and thinks it'll steal her thunder. I've tried to explain to her that our weddings will be as different as night and day and that hers will not have any attention taken by mine, but she was still upset and insisted I wait until after her marriage and I told her I wasn't going to wait till she decided she had enough for the perfect marriage and leave my daughters potential future in limbo just to please her.\n\nShe got upset with me and some friends of the family feel I was too harsh with her though our Mother has said she'll talk to her to try and calm things down, am I in the wrong here to speed through this when my sister is still waiting to get married?\n\nUPDATE: So I found out the reasoning for her outrage from our Mother who has been speaking to my sister, apparently her partner has been putting out there that they just settle for less than the \"dream\" and make do with the money they have right now even throwing out there that they have a Courthouse wedding and a lavish Honeymoon instead. I guess she felt my wedding would put additional pressure on this while she wants the dream.", "created_utc": 1684878418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q1w0g/aita_for_planning_to_have_my_wedding_before_my/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your boyfriend have a different situation than your sister, not that it should matter.  Get married when it is best for you and your boyfriend. Your sister is being immature, selfish and petty.  Congratulations to you both and the best of luck.", "Nta at all.  Enjoy your elopement.", "NTA. It sounds as though her wedding isn't even scheduled yet? She's being ridiculous.", "NTA - Your sister has a four years and running moratorium on anyone else getting married? Thats preposterous. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding, enjoy.", "NTA. Sounds like sis doesn\u2019t even have a date for her wedding while you so idk how it will steal her thunder specially when you\u2019re just doing a courthouse wedding.", "NTA. Sister has made up a nonsense rule. Do what you want and let her get over herself and the \"line jumping\" she's so angry about. You have a good reason not to wait.", "NTA. I really don't understand modern wedding culture. So, a woman who has been engaged for 4 years can ban everyone else from getting married until she gets around to doing it? I don't think so. Do what you need to do and she'll get over it eventually...or she won't... but that's on her either way.", "Clearly NTA. I strongly disagree with all the \u201cmy wedding year\u201d, \u201cseason\u201d etc etc. She didn\u2019t even have a date yet and has been engaged for four years. She can\u2019t expect you to put your life on hold because she\u2019s saving\u2026", "NTA. Congratulations on your wedding, and your little girl. Your sister is being unreasonable and your weddings will not over shadow each others.", "That rule about weddings being ordered by engagement dates only stands when an actual date has been set! Your sister has dragged it out over four years and set no date, so NTA.  Cheers on a happy marriage!", "NTA\n\nJust because things haven't worked out for your sister's timing doesn't mean you have to wait until it finally does. It's not a competition and she's being overly dramatic.", "NTA. Even with the pandemic 4 years is a very long time to be engaged, you don\u2019t even mention her having a date so my guess is she doesn\u2019t meaning you don\u2019t know how long you would be waiting. She\u2019s made the choice to wait you have no obligation to.", "NTA at all.  Your sister has been engaged for 4 years. How long would she have you wait? You are within your rights to get married whenever you wish.", "NTA/INFO\n\nWhen is your sisters wedding?", "INFO: Has your sister scheduled her wedding yet?  \n\nThat aside, I assume you\u2019re talking to a lawyer about what\u2019s involved in actually adopting his daughter, because at least in the US, being married to her father doesn\u2019t give you any greater claim to custody than her other family unless you go through the hoops of having her mother\u2019s parental rights terminated and then legally adopting her.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYour sister is an immature AH though. \n\nYour reasons for marrying and the timing of the wedding have absolutely nothing to do with her. You are not playing some ridiculous game of race to the altar, you are doing what is right for you and your family. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding, and best wishes for a long and happy life together!", "NTA. It's not a competition. Brides who see it that way just amaze me. If it was the same week, I'd get it. Same month, a bit of a stretch but I'd still get it. But she doesn't even have a date! That's on her, and you have no moral obligation to wait.", "NTA. Her dream wedding planning is making her self absorbed. There are no rules for how the order of weddings have to go.", "NTA. She doesn't even have a date and even if she did it would still be ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nPutting aside any nonexistent \u2018right\u2019 to get married first, the weddings couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\nAnd hers doesn\u2019t even have a date yet!

I wish you, your partner and your daughter a long, very happy life together.\n\nAs for your sister.  Good money says she never actually gets married because she\u2019s more focused on her \u201cdream wedding\u201d than her relationship.", "It\u2019s your life, and your decision, not hers.\n\nNTA.", "Nta, she is being ridiculous. Congrats.", "You don't live your life on behalf of your sister, it's yours, your family and circumstances are the priority over her hurt feelings.

Your sister wants a wedding, whereas you are ready for marriage. You are correct\u2014 this is night and day. I wish you and your beautiful family a lifetime of health and happiness.", "Thank you!", "It isn't, they're trying to save up for the perfect wedding which is their right but for us we don't care about the actual ceremony it's just about ensuring our daughter is as protected as we can make her. I plan to legally adopt her as soon as possible once the ink is dry.", "No, the moratorium is only on Op getting married. Can't have the younger sister getting married before the older!", "There is no date yet, as they're still saving for their dream wedding.", "> He doesn't want his family getting his daughter if anything happened to him and his ex girlfriends side play no part in the daughters life either. \n\nOur daughters Bio Mother and her family have no legal sway over our daughter, that was sorted out some time ago after she abandoned her, it's why that sentence is worded this way, the only concern was his family getting hold of her if anything happened to him. Once we're married it will make legally adopting her easier it's why as soon as the ink is dry we're making moves for that.", "I never understood people like this - maybe the weekend before or weekend after so youre not over burdening an over lapping guest list but otherwise, who cares!? People get married all the time.", "Then there is no 'thunder' to steal. \n\nThe dates don't conflict and it's not like you are asking people to travel twice in a short amount of time to attend weddings. \n\nEnjoy your dinner with your family.", "Good deal.  I just wanted to make sure because some people really do think that just getting married is enough, and that\u2019s not something anyone wants to learn for the first time during a custody battle.", "NTA.  Your sister doesn\u2019t own your family wedding rights.  She is completely unreasonable and crazy.  Enjoy your wedding.  Congratulations", "So it\u2019s a courthouse wedding to protect a child\u2026 I mean NTA but it does make your sister a jerk. I would get her being hurt but it\u2019s something for you guys and protecting your family not some huge overdone thing. Meaning your sister is being selfish and childish. You\u2019re not trying to steal spotlight you\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for a literal child.", "NTA, congratulations! Your sister has unreasonable expectations and demands. Enjoy your day!", "NTA, she is being ridiculous and I'm sure her wedding will \"outshine\" yours, when they actually decide to have it.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine if she wants to wait, but she\u2019s trying to put vibes in front of the safety of a family structure for a small child.", "NTA\n\nYou just do your wedding as planned. Your sister's issues are very much her own, and she will need to work them out. The differences in her and her fiance's thinking are just that and cannot be solved by you not having a wedding. Frankly, if the success of her marriage depends upon you delaying your wedding indefinitely, then I'd say that life-partnership is already on shaky ground.\n\nHopefully, now that sis has acknowledged the undercurrent in her own plans, she'll just accept that you need to take care of your own life, and she and her fiance need to figure out their lives, regardless of what you or anyone else is doing.", "You are essentially eloping.  CONGRATS.\n\nYou sister is being entitled. Engaged for 4 yrs, and not married because they want their \"dream Wedding.\"  That is their problem, not yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She needs to take a step back and realize your life doesn't revolve her. That is absolutely ridiculous for her to act that way", "NTA. She does not get to set your timeline. Nor is it your fault she/they haven't been able to save enough ... yet. Champagne dreams w a tap water budget?", "NTA", "NTA I eloped and regret absolutely nothing. Sometimes I wish I had taken more pictures but that is it. I hope you feel special with your family on your wedding day!\n\nI feel badly for your sister, every girl deserves to feel special on their wedding day. No matter what that is. Hope she finds a happy medium too.", "YTA ESH", "NTA\n\nYou want a marriage. She wants a wedding.", "You need to adopt her. You can\u2019t just marry her father and expect the courts to give you full custody of a biologically unrelated to you, child. You and he need to sit down with a lawyer and get the adoption ball rolling. It\u2019s the only thing that will protect you in the event of his death while she is still a minor.", "You still need to petition for TPR of her rights and adopt the child. Marriage only protects biological children. It doesn\u2019t protect step children. Please talk to a lawyer about adoption asap."]}
