If not, get one ASAP as confusion is a symptom - occasionally people who believe they have a haunted house find that the haunting \"goes away\" after carbon monoxide issues are fixed, plus it can be fatal.  I've seen the original 1944 movie Gaslight, and it's a pretty damning statement about your relationship if you suspect that's what your husband is doing, and presumably there are other red flags in your relationship.  If you don't trust your husband, then cameras aren't unreasonable, but secret recording is going to have relationship consequences regardless of the outcome.", "NTA.

She's not trying to spy on him necessarily. \nShe's trying to find out if she's really forgetting these things or if he's pulling some weird gaslighting stuff on her out of nowhere. \n\nI would think that she could have the cameras up for a week or 2 and figure it out pretty quickly. \n\nHide the cameras very well, and best of luck! \n\nNTA", "go see a doctor.

Either way, a camera is your answer. I recently got a second camera for outdoors for 30 dollars.

If you are truly forgetting, I would think he'd be 100% onboard in order to prove his point.

No you aren't the asshole as something weird is happening but also you are spying on him and that makes you the asshole. \nIf he finds out that's a breach of trust. That's on you. If you find out that he is gaslighting that's a breach of trust and that's on him. \nI would investigate. The toothbrush thing is just weird and not like the other things.

Few uncertainties here it seems, but OP, the only thing that will be certain is your complete lack of faith, trust and respect you have for your husband if you do this. \n\nYou say you have no reason at all to suspect your husband of doing something like this, but you are ready to secretly install cameras in your home as a response? Seriously OP, take a step back and really consider what I just said there. That right there might be a sign you actually should seek some help.", "YTA. Recording someone in their own home without their knowledge is really horrible thing to do and probably pretty illegal too.

Either he is in fact doing these things and gaslighting you, or you have a medical condition that needs to be addressed. \n\nThe reason I went with NTA is that he's so nonchalant about it. If I told my husband these things he'd be instantly alarmed and worried.

If you really think your husband gaslighting you is more likely than a medical issue to the point that you won\u2019t even see a doctor, your marriage is probably doomed regardless of what you do. I had weird memory issues that gradually got worse and it turned out to be small seizures. It doesn\u2019t hurt to get checked out. Do you have a close friend or relative you can confide in? It could help to have someone else let you know if you seem to be more forgetful now or if they think your husband is acting sketchy.", "This sucks because the only way to combat gaslighting is with proof.
