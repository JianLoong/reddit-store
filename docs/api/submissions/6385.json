Being paranoid about your partner under those circumstances doesn't mean you lack trust for them in real life. I certainly wouldn't blame my partner for irrational behavior if it was literally due to them experiencing poisoning, even if they did hide a camera in our home to make sure I wasn't gaslighting them.

It is also not illegal for her to film the inside of her house without informing the husband. So I would say, yes, it is a very similar situation as physical abuse and should be treated as a possible crime.\n\n In the event of a crime like physical abuse, we excuse certain violations of privacy. Another example of this is a nanny cam. That should violate the nanny's right to privacy, but all you have to do is google \"nanny cam\" and find lots of examples of children being abused and the nanny being charged. I personally think this falls under reasonable cause. For instance, if the parents didn't think their child might be getting abused, then I would say it is really wrong for the parents to record their nanny and it would be creepy as hell. \n\nI think every redditor jumping to her being poisoned by CO even though she has a CO detector seems like just as crazy speculation from my point of view. It seems like everyone remembers one of the story that was posted on reddit about the person thinking their house was haunted and it turned out to be CO or the post it note story and assume that is the answer for everything. She remembers doing something, then said thing isn't done. That means she has a brain issue, a ghost problem, or she is being gaslit. I also think the ghosts of victorian children won't know how to work a modern boiler or dishwasher so we could rule that out. Only two choices are left and filming her kitchen could give her answers in one day and will result in her getting medical help or domestic abuse evidence.
