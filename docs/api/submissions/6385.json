I'd pop to your GP in the morning though.", "It sounds a lot like early stage of dementia as well. I would make an appointment with my doctor if only to rule out any ailment that can cause this type of behaviour.\n\nDementia patients typically blame others for inexplicable things like these. And the SO is more likely to get irritated for the person being lazy and nonchalant than worried, because the behaviour pattern sneaks up on you and your first thought is not likely to be \"it's dementia\".", "NTA\n\nMy first thought was maybe the beginnings of dementia.", "This is the way. It is also his home. You do not have a moral right to watch and record him *without his permission* in his home. He has a right to his own privacy. \n\nWith that out of the way, the above poster is absolutely correct. There are ways of dealing with the situation that doesn\u2019t include intentionally withholding your actions from him and invading his privacy. \n\nJust talk to him about the camera. Do not spy on your significant other. Especially one you have already stated has given you no reason to distrust him. If you would like to potentially wreck your relationship only to find out your husband was a good dude all along, that\u2019s all on you I guess.\n\n**Most importantly, listen to the above posters and run out and get your carbon monoxide detector NOW!**\n\nYWBTA for secretly recording your husband in his own home. And depending on the recording type and state, may not even be legal. So be careful.", "My brother was dead (unresponsive, no pulse, not breathing) for a few minutes due to carbon monoxide. Go to Home Depot now.", "OP, just echoing what others here are saying. Don\u2019t order off Amazon, leave your house/apartment/whatever and go get one from a store nearby. \n\nThe toothpaste on the toothbrush is scary, from a \u201coh no it\u2019s probably CO\u201d perspective.", "In the US you can call your local fire department and they can do a monoxide inspection. They may be able to do something similar wherever you are", "Don't get one off Amazon - that takes time to deliver; you wouldn't order a fire extinguisher from Amazon when you had a fire burning your kitchen down. This is the same. AND IT'S YOUR LIFE AT RISK HERE, and your children and pets if you have any.\n\nGo buy one from your local DIY store straight away. Like right now. Get in your car, or a bus or a taxi if you have to. This is an 11/10 situation - it's not a 'wait till tomorrow' thing.", "> I'm going to buy a portable one off amazon.\n\nDon't wait that long. This is too important.", "Big Asda, Tesco, Sainsburys etc. should sell them (and still be open atm).", "I'm going to be blunt; no, not off Amazon.  Go out now and buy one.  If you do have a CO issue, even waiting for next day shipping is incredibly dangerous.", "Go buy one now. Like, now. Update please", "Go to a home goods store and buy one if this is what's been causing it you may not survive one more night", "I saw your comment that you have a CO detector mounted on the ceiling.  CO is heavier than regular air, so it should be mounted three feet or lower, and the closer to the floor, the better.  Having it on the ceiling wont' catch it until it's too late.", "She\u2019s in the UK. All of your American suggestions are unfortunately useless.", "Exposure levels matter for CO, so not necessarily. If OP works from home and he works long days at the office, OP would show signs first especially if he's a bigger person.\n\nAlso, he might be forgetting things too but they're less obvious. OP seems to be in charge of household chores so that makes it really obvious when things aren't getting done. If he's simply misplacing things or being forgetful in a less intrusive way, he may not even notice it - or he might attribute those oddities to OP too.\n\nEither way, given how deadly CO is and how easy it is to rule out, checking the levels in her home is definitely the first step for OP.", ">We have ceiling mounted ones\n\nThese are better than nothing, but (iirc) not a guarantee because CO might be at a dangerous level before a ceiling detector registers it. The risk goes up if you have higher ceilings. Getting a portable device is a good idea.\n\n>I'm going to buy a portable one off amazon.\n\nThis...is a less good idea. If you think there is the possibility of a CO leak and you're already showing symptoms to suggest you're affected, you shouldn't continue to sleep in that home while you wait for a detector. CO poisoning is deadly. If there is any way to buy a detector in person today, do so.", "> We have ceiling mounted ones that are combined with fire detectors. \n\nWAIT - you already have these monoxide detectors and they aren't registering? you should get that camera off amazon in the same order.", "I know you might be worried enough from the comments here, but if you can I really recommend you go to a home improvement store in your area (Lowe's, Home Depot, etc.) and buy one today. It will be worth it regardless for your peace of mind over the next few nights. Levels ok: you're not going to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. Levels not ok: you GTFO of your house, see a doctor, and don't return until everything is 100% fixed.

If it turns out to be the gas, you can tell him about the camera and laugh about it later - otherwise yeah I'd do both.", "The toothpaste thing gives me pause - I can definitely tell by the taste and feel of my mouth in the morning on the occasions when I've fallen asleep without brushing. Did your mouth seem like your teeth hadn't been brushed?", "Let me guess : driving you crazy so he was there to support you ?", "Mine too. More likely than husband suddenly turning evil and gaslighting her unless that's something he's been prone to do. \n\nCould be a symptom of anything neurological, just my experience is with dementia.", "I would see a Dr. I was also having episodes where I was leaving the stove on but my brain remembered turning it off. Turns out my brain was mimicking a brain tumor.", "I'd also see a medical Dr. Memory lapse is a symptom of several medical conditions", "They obviously don't live in the US so no Walmart or Home Depot.", "He might be as well and just doesn't realize it. And yes, exposure level absolutely matters. If it's a small leak, the constant exposure that she's getting will affect her faster.", "Well we don\u2019t know that he isn\u2019t having memory issues, just that some of the household chores (like the dishes, cooking, etc.) that fall to OP aren\u2019t getting done. It sounds like OP is forgetting to do them.\n\nThe fact that OP notes leaving the stove or oven on, too, is scary, because that could be a source of CO on its own.", "Apparently, CO might not rise all the way up to your ceiling, so there could be dangerous levels in the house that a ceiling-mounted detector won't catch.", "But to be clear, one of these is more urgent than the other. If OP is being gaslit, waiting until tomorrow for a camera won\u2019t make much of a difference. \n\nIf it\u2019s CO poisoning, waiting could have dire consequences for OP.

In Britain it's ASDA.", "I was pretty certain there were ASDA/Walmarr in Germany but I didn't I didn't say it's in every of the 180+ sovereign countries. I'm pretty sure there's stores on most continents though and like I followed up; There are still going to be home goods stores wherever op lives"]}
