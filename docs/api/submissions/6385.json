In the 2nd paragraph, OP states that she remembers doing these things, but her husband says she didn't.  This isn't your wife saying you forgot something and you agree you forgot it.\n\n>If it was me I'd just ask my wife if it's okay to set up the cameras. \n\nAs someone who has been gaslit, if you think you are being gaslit, don't do that.  \n\n>If you believe your partner is maliciously gaslighting you the marriage is already broken beyond repair so what's the point of being evidence?\n\nThe point: SANITY.  The worst part of being gaslit is thinking that you're going insane.  The evidence will prove, even if it's just to yourself, that you can trust your own mind and instincts.  That you are not going crazy.  That you are not wrong.\n\nI mean sure if you present the evidence to the person gaslighting you they'll say that you're wrong or you manipulated it or tricked them to make them look bad or whatever.  (Learned that the hard way).  But get the evidence for yourself, for your own piece of mind.\n\nSorry if I'm coming off as harsh.

But he doesn\u2019t seem to be?", "Interesting - google tells me you're right. It has a density so close to that of air as to be the same. The advice is to put the detector near your bed so you'll hear it faster, but it will disburse evenly throughout the room.  I'll still get that portable one to test for lower levels, but I am more reassured that my ceiling mounted ones will keep us alive, and UK building standards aren't actively trying to get us killed.

So then it would make sense for my wife to bring up \"Hey, saw there are dishes and soap in the dishwasher but it hasn't been started, did you mean to start it?\"\n\nSo for me, there are two paths. Either you believe your partner is gaslighting you, thus you can't trust them, thus the marriage is already broken and there's not really any additional steps other than to make an exit plan. Alternatively, you don't believe your partner is gaslighting you and should proceed ahead to determine the extent of whatever the underlying issue is that's causing the memory lapses.\n\nTo that extent, the plan that makes the least sense to me is getting a camera to get evidence without making a plan to leave them. If you already believe that your partner could do something like that to you, whether they actually are or not is fairly irrelevant, the relationship is already broken so you should spend your energy on leaving instead.", "Then which country am I speaking to?", "Including Walmart and Home Depot.
