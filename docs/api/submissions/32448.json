So I went into their room and there they are, my 2 toys are on their floor (which is fucking filthy with trash by the way). I literally threw up in my mouth. I feel so disgusted and not comfortable in my apartment anymore. Who knows how many times they\u2019ve used or grabbed my toys when they know I won\u2019t be home during work hours. I feel so violated and such an invasion of my personal space and property. \n\nWe\u2019ve been best friends since 2018 and have lived together for 2 years prior to this.
