Well, my roommate has a tendency of using my stuff (like beauty products, candles, coats, etc) so my mind immediately went to \u2018oh my fucking god they used my toys\u2019. So I went into their room and there they are, my 2 toys are on their floor (which is fucking filthy with trash by the way). I literally threw up in my mouth. I feel so disgusted and not comfortable in my apartment anymore. Who knows how many times they\u2019ve used or grabbed my toys when they know I won\u2019t be home during work hours. I feel so violated and such an invasion of my personal space and property. \n\nWe\u2019ve been best friends since 2018 and have lived together for 2 years prior to this. Arguments about them taking my stuff has happened on more than 1 occasion and they recognize taking my stuff without asking was wrong but now that fact that it hasn\u2019t stopped and NOW ITS MY FUCKING VIBRATORS. How do I even bring this up?? \n\nThey just texted with an apology while I\u2019m writing this saying theirs broke last night so they were doing research and wanted to see what mine were\u2026 BRO WHAT????? DID YOU NOT THINK TO ASK ME MY RECOMMENDATIONS OR ANYTHING????? BUT YOU DECIDED TO TAKE THE MOST INTIMATE ITEM A PERSON OWNS. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. They\u2019re at work for a couple more hours but my blood is BOILING and I\u2019m very anxious for this conversation but I know it has to happen. I do think their apology is bullshit bc why are they on the floor of their bedroom. Now I won\u2019t be able to use them without thinking of this incident and that\u2019s $200 worth of toys\u2026 \n\nUpdate: We talked about it and they are very apologetic which I cannot forgive right now and they said they don\u2019t ever expect me to. But how am I supposed to live comfortably in my apartment til August with someone who was my best friend 24 hours ago then this happened and I can\u2019t trust anything from them now. I brought up putting a lock on my door to keep them out and they seemed taken back by it but they invaded my personal space. I\u2019m gonna do it anyways but what the actual fuck.\n\nHappy Tuesday I guess \n\nTLDR: Roommate took my vibrators out of my room because they \u2018couldn\u2019t stop themselves\u2019 and said they \u2018didn\u2019t use them\u2019.", "created_utc": 1701840696, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bwxv3/aita_for_putting_a_lock_on_my_bedroom_door_after/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
