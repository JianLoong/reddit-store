Periods are messy, unpredictable and accidents  happen. Plus as a teenager you are still mastering your period care.  \n\nEdit: what is with the BS teachers have to put up with and ANY teacher ever telling ANY female student she can\u2019t go to the bathroom to deal with period problems?!?!?!?

Teachers not letting people go to the bathroom? I thought that was just a plot device for TV shows.

I went to the bathroom during passing period and was late to my next class because i was so confused about the pain and in pain. Got to my second period class and then asked if i could go to the nurse. My teacher kept saying no, until one of my classmates looked and me and noticed I was major league grimacing from pain, and said that they were taking me to the nurse. The teacher tried to give us both detention, and the nurse chewed him a new one.

I have told my kids that if they are ever denied bathroom privileges, they have myvpermission to walk out of class, and I will support them 100%.\n\nThat beng said, I am bothered by the fact that you stayed you were tardy to your 1st period class AND then needed to use the restroom .  You have now interrupted the class twice.  Being a teacher is difficult enough.  I do tell my kids that they should be respectful of their teachers and do their best not to leave their classrooms on a regular basis.\n\nAlso, as a medical professional, I would urge you to speak to your physician about your menstrual cycle if you need to change your pad/tampon frequently. To not be able to go from the time you get dressed through your 1st period class without neesed to change your product might need to be looked into.", "If this happens again, give your teacher a note indicating the reason and walk out to use the bathroom.  Or say you need to see the nurse who you could have explained the issue.  You did yourself a disservice by saying \u201cnot really\u201d when the teacher was trying to let you go at the end of class.  By saying \u201cnot really\u201d you indicated that you did not have an emergency.  Why wouldn\u2019t you want to go when the hallways were free and the bathroom probably empty?", "NTA, in fact you seem to be doing everything right. Students are people with bodily needs and many educators forget that.", "NAH\n\nThe school and/or teacher has a bathroom policy and one that is obviously put in place to limit the time a student misses in class. I would hope the teacher would make exceptions for girls on their periods, but since OP didn't bother to ask,  we don't know.\n\nFor all the people who rant that students should be allowed to go to the bathroom whenever they want,  I invite you to check out the tiktok bathroom challenges regarding destroying bathrooms. I invite you to ask teachers what happens when students are allowed to go to the bathroom whenever they want. \n\nIn a perfect world,  everyone - students,  teachers,  retail workers,  random people off the street -  would be able to go to the bathroom whenever the need struck them,  but we don't live in a perfect world.\n\nWe live in a world where kindergarteners take crayons and markers into the bathroom to draw on the walls. We live in a world where second graders bring vapes to school. We live in a world where fifth graders smear shit all over the bathroom and hallway floors and walls. (All that happened at my school this year.)\n\nThen there are the tiktok challenges,  skipping class,  vaping and general shenanigans. \n\nThere are reasons why schools and teachers have strict bathroom policies. For that matter,  there are reasons why fast food places and retail stores have rules about bathroom use. \n\nBecause too many people are assholes and fuck it up for the rest of us.\n\nFor those who say \"but I wouldnt do that,  why am I being punished?\" It's for the same reason most people are cautious around off-leash dogs or snakes or strangers approaching them in dark or isolated locations - because there are too many incidences of dog attacks,  snake bites and assaults for us to blindly trust that you are one of the \"good ones\". \n\nIt's frustrating but stop blaming the people - teachers,  retail clerks - who have to create and/or enforce the bathroom policies and start blaming the jackasses who post tiktok bathroom challenges or think it's a good idea to flood the bathroom in various ways.\n\nAnd OP,  next time use your words and explain the situation. You might still have been denied,  but it would have been more mature than leaving the room like a petulant child. From the teachers perspective,  you confirmed the need for the bathroom policy and other rules.", "If you have to go, then you have to go, but I think your school system is odd. At my school you wouldn't be allowed to go at the beginning of a lesson because it would be expected that you would go before you got there. Even so, if you have to go, you have to go.", "Geez, teachers can be so controlling. I understand that classroom order is important, but one can't control the release of their uterine lining. NTA", "NAH I think. I want to ere on the side of caution with this assessment because it sounds like it's a system in place to avoid students just futzing about in the bathroom. The sticker for me that the teacher is NTA as well because she didn't file a referral, and that would've been more hassle than the actual detention tbh. I would just go in apologetic for disregarding the system in place, but do not apologize for the reason. Apologize for the how not the why. When asked, just be bluntly honest, you where having a heavy day, and another second longer and the issue at hand would've been a health violation that would've had a bigger impact than you leaving. They would've had to evacuate the classroom, clean the desk and floor, and help you in the same moment. I think explaining it rationally would be the best option. Hopefully, they can help you and not hinder you or any other girl or even boy. Yes, this might even be an issue beyond feminine hygiene. What if someone has IBS or chrohns? They might just also need to run out without explanation, even with a note. It just points out the flaws in this system.", "NTA You shouldn\u2019t have to tell someone what\u2019s going on with your privates for you to be granted permission to use a bathroom! You\u2019re old enough to know when you need to use a bathroom. I have a bunch of teachers in my family and I\u2019ve heard all the stories.

Your reason for needing the bathroom is valid, but you know the rules and your teacher was going to let you go during the last five minutes.

In the US, you can leave the classroom and use the restroom, even if you've been denied (it's not widely known, so I bet I'm going to get downvoted and people are going to argue otherwise). You can get a UTI and kidney infections if you hold it in for too long and it would be on the teacher for not letting you use the restroom. The fact you're also on your period, if you leave it in for longer than the recommended time, you can get TSS, which is another thing you can get the teacher in trouble with.

Not having to give separate instruction to a kid who ducked out during the instructions phase.\n2. Kids leaving the room bc they don't want to do class work (Kids w IEPs might have breaks written in bc of this, but the biggest \"hide in the bathroom bc I hate math\" Kids are generally gened.)\n3.

Kids who just saw an enemy and want to go fight.\n\nIs it mildly embarrassing to explain to the teacher that you really do need the bathroom this instant for a biological reason?
