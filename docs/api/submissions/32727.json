They only let students go during the first 5 minutes of class and the last 5 minutes before the bell rings, we're not allowed to use the restroom in-between. I came in somewhat late one day and asked to use the restroom to which I'm told that she doesn't have any left and that I can go during the last 5 minutes of class. I sit down, and not 5 minutes later I come back and ask again, I get the same response. She again tells me that I can go during the last 5 minutes to which I respond \"not really.\"\n\nIt was that time of the month, I was already in a bad mood when I got to school. She must of saw me looking at the door because she tells me that if I walk out I'm getting a referral. I walk out, because I literally can't wait until those last 5 minutes or I'll bleed through my damn leggings. When I come back she gives me detention for Monday.\n\nI took this issue to my AP to argue against the referral and I'm told that one hasn't been filed against me, but I still wanted to talk about what happened so they had me write out an incident report and now I have a meeting with my AP and that teacher this Monday. I want some outside opinion before that meeting, sure I could have told her it was an emergency but honestly I don't believe she would have let me regardless, I didn't exactly want to share *why* I needed to go to her so badly either. I do feel like I may have been the asshole for just walking out without emphasizing why I needed to go so badly, I shared this story with a few friends who told me i was just making the teachers job harder and that i could have waited.\n\nEDIT: to answer why I didn't go before class since I was already late, I was only late by a few minutes after the bell rang so i was able to walk in without getting stopped by my teacher. If I was later I would be stopped and asked if I had a pass (office gives you a pass if your very late) I figured it would be better to just go straight to class than risk that. The bathroom is located directly across one of the offices in my school so we have a few counselors standing outside their offices as well as two hall mods standing outside the bathrooms, it was still somewhat early so the halls were still busy. We have morning announcements that we watch during the first 10 minutes of class (events, games, etc) and if announcements are short we get to hang out for 5 minutes before any lessons start. I came in before announcements.

You have now interrupted the class twice.  Being a teacher is difficult enough.

We live in a world where second graders bring vapes to school. We live in a world where fifth graders smear shit all over the bathroom and hallway floors and walls.

The sticker for me that the teacher is NTA as well because she didn't file a referral, and that would've been more hassle than the actual detention tbh. I would just go in apologetic for disregarding the system in place, but do not apologize for the reason. Apologize for the how not the why. When asked, just be bluntly honest, you where having a heavy day, and another second longer and the issue at hand would've been a health violation that would've had a bigger impact than you leaving. They would've had to evacuate the classroom, clean the desk and floor, and help you in the same moment. I think explaining it rationally would be the best option. Hopefully, they can help you and not hinder you or any other girl or even boy. Yes, this might even be an issue beyond feminine hygiene. What if someone has IBS or chrohns?

However, if you think actual individual teachers are setting bathroom policies and give a shit about enforcing them, you\u2019re absolutely delusional.  \n\nAdmin sets bathroom policies, and expects teachers to enforce them.  Additionally, most restrictions on student use of the bathroom are pretty reasonable.  At my school, students aren\u2019t allowed to use the bathrooms during the first 10 or last 10 minutes of any period.  The reason for this is that because before that rule was instituted, they\u2019d hide in the bathrooms to vape between classes and then not show up to class.\n\nHalfway through last year, bathroom use during class was banned altogher.  I felt really bad for the students\u2026 until I learned that it was because they had been literally destroying the bathrooms and recording it for TikTok.  Literally smashing sinks and mirrors and toilets.\n\nSo, yeah.  I get why you had to break the rules; if it\u2019s an emergency you\u2019ve gotta just go, even if the rules say not to.  But your teacher is just doing her job, and the fact that she didn\u2019t write you up for further punishment implies that she understands the situation and is trying to walk the line of enforcing the rules that her employer has directed her to enforce, and not giving a fuck about who uses the bathroom or when.", "Neither of you are the asshole. As someone who works in a school the bathroom policy kills me, I think it's awful but I also understand why it's there cus it really is the few that destroy it for the majority. \nBroken doors, broken toilets (like actually smashed), deliberately flooding it, vaping and therefore setting off the fire alarm causing everyone to be evacuated out the building (and don't get me started on how often that happens which also causes 2 of the epileptic kids to have seizures and 3 of the ASD ones to shutdown every fucking time, which they can't help but fuck me it's a lot of work).\nBut I do think teachers need to just use their judgement, you can normally tell if it's a genuine need and you should know your class well enough to know if this is/isn't someone who would abuse that for shits and giggles. By not reporting you I think the teacher does understand but she also has to say that because if not then the fall out from the rest is mental, why is she allowed to go not me? Blah blah. She has followed the school policy but has not adhered to it which I think is the best outcome short of you honestly just saying, look sorry it's my time of the month I can't wait. The other kids don't know you've not been written up so they think it's all fair so no fallout. \nI get it's annoying and embarrassing and I agree you shouldn't have to but it all comes back to those few who can't be trusted and spoil it for all.\nEdit: also if you were already late and the first thing you did was ask to go to the bathroom (which is how your post reads) you should have gone before going to lesson, you were already late so might as well yeah", "NTA.

It was horrendous what the did. Clogged all the toilets, somehow ripped sinks and paper towel dispensers off the wall. This was a brand new building in a very affluent area. It sucker but we couldn\u2019t trust kids to use the bathrooms on their own. We had to have parent volunteers monitor the bathroom at all times. \n\nTrust me. We don\u2019t want to be assholes by not letting kids use the bathrooms when they need to.", "My professor sent an email a while ago saying we will be marked late if we use the bathroom during class bc we \u201conly have a mere 75 minutes of class time\u201d this email was sent a day after she ridiculed me in front of the entire class for running to the bathroom right after class started so I didn\u2019t miss the film we were watching", "Lol, exactly! My son was denied the bathroom in year R (5 yo) during lunch because he gets distracted and hadn't eaten much. He had an accident. He told me about it quietly, I convinced him to tell his teacher. Bless her, her face! Went deadly serious (she's usually bubbly), she asked him a few more questions and said she'd bring it up with senior management. \n\nI teach 6th form (16-18 yo) and I do my best to tell them to do their best to find a good time in the lesson for a toilet break (not while I'm explaining at the board for example) and I feel so guilty when they're working on stuff, I just finished talking 1 to 1 with a student helping out and the next hand up is asking to go to the loo.", "It\u2019s ridiculous. Bodily functions should never be denied by an authority figure. Yeah, sometimes kids abuse the right to go to the bathroom, but their grades will suffer as a result. That\u2019s on them.", "\"Successfully escaped.\" Is this a prison we're talking about?", "I totally understand that. But at the same time, it\u2019s a bodily function and it really shouldn\u2019t be denied. It\u2019s obviously not a perfect system, and kids will abuse the opportunity, but their grades will suffer as a result.", "Yep. Many high school students can't handle the responsibility of a free for all bathroom pass. Maybe they should be able to, but that's not the reality. \n\nMy bathroom policy as a high school teacher is one at a time and you're expected to take about 5 minutes (the bathrooms are across the hall from my room). It actually helps them get back quicker when they know that others are waiting on them, and I'll leven have them text their friends to come back when they take too long. I do make exceptions for emergencies, of course.", "I understand teachers are put in a tricky position and I\u2019m not sure where to draw the line on this. \n\nWhen I was in the 6th grade I had to use the restroom and my teacher repeatedly told me no. I ended up having an accident in class and it was mortifying. \n\nI think we can definitely do better than that for students. Especially considering in highschool kids are dealing with major shifts in their bodies.", "I had a teacher who figured out the (mostly) perfect system for this. You asked to go to the bathroom and if it was in the middle of the lesson/instructions, he\u2019d ask if you could wait until that portion was done. If not, you could go, but if so, you would be able to go as soon as it was done. As for the other stuff, there are already consequences for missing class and getting into fights etc. I don\u2019t think that denying a bodily function is an acceptable punishment, especially since it also punishes the kids that haven\u2019t done anything wrong.", "Thank you, you just saved me a bunch of typing.", "That makes sense. It\u2019s one of those things that doesn\u2019t *really* have a good answer sadly.", "I get that. Tbh I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a perfect answer to the issue. At the same time, bodily functions shouldn\u2019t be denied.", "I don\u2019t think you can generalise for a whole country.

Grew up largely in the UK.", "Yes, but the kids that use it to skip class will have their grades suffer as a result. Bodily functions shouldn\u2019t be denied. Ever.", "But this isn\u2019t an admin policy. It\u2019s a teacher policy. It\u2019s not school wide. It\u2019s teacher specific. Maybe the teacher made this rule to make admin happy but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is unreasonable", "Because it's her own personal business and she should be allowed to go if she needs to. Sometimes you really can't hold it for another 20 minutes, period or no period. NTA.", "A female teacher should be able to tell why a female student suddenly would need the toilet during class and why it can't wait. And should be able to get why said student don't want to announce it in front of the whole class.", "So fuckin what. You really want to be that person? \"SoMeTImEs ThEy MiSuSe the ReSTRooM!\" \n\nThe OP doesn't need to announce to anyone that she's about to bleed through her leggings. The teacher is an AH flat out for her refusal. Period. No pun intended. Using the bathroom is not a privilege, it's a basic human right.", "It doesn't matter that that's the reason. \"I need to go to the bathroom\" should be all that needs to be said. \n\nIf she's consistently going more than once a class period, then a meeting needs to be had to determine why, if accommodations need to be made, or if disciplinary steps need to be taken. But every student should be able to go to the bathroom when they need to go. It's a human right.", "OP isn\u2019t required to give their teacher information about their menstrual cycle, and the suggestion that they are is fucking insane.\n\n\u201cI NEED to go to the bathroom\u201d is all that should need to be said, she\u2019s a student, not a convict", "A child shouldn't have to disclose their menstruation to anyone to go to the bathroom. The rule is 5 minutes at the beginning of the period, 5 minutes at the end. Why would you try to reason with a teacher that's obviously unreasonable?", "Yeah and I never told the entire class that I was on my period or any other reason that I needed to go. That\u2019d be well embarrassing \u201csorry sir/miss my uterus lining is falling out and I need to sort a sanitary item\u201d.\n\nIf you need the bathroom, you need the bathroom.", "As she should have done", "Exactly. That fact will be lost on most of this subreddit though.  I\u2019ve never seen a community so hostile to education and teachers in general \ud83e\udd23", "Then find another way to deal with that issue. You don't deny a human right.", "So you punish that behavior: you don't take other people's rights away.", "Doesn\u2019t seem justified to me. Punish many for the actions of a few. The UN defines this as group punishment and a war crime.", "for some bizarre reason, those teachers seem to think that women can. I know I can't! If women could control their menstruation, I'd never have one again!", "They're a different shade of loser.  They're all either bullies or victims of bullies with a chip on their shoulder.", "That is absolutely horrifying", "That's very convenient for people with large bladders and no medical issues!", "Is this university or school? Americans use school for both so sometimes I don't understand", "When I used to teach this was the case. Not only were they missing out on their own education but they'd usually go disrupt other classrooms during their wandering also.", "Exactly.", "This! As a former teacher, I know it sounds absurd. But OP came into class late and wanted to use the restroom, so the teacher wanted to limit the amount of instruction they were missing. \n\nUniversity students are different because they\u2019re paying to be in class and most of them won\u2019t waste time and only go to the bathroom if they need to. \n\nWhen I first started teaching middle school, I too thought it was ridiculous to deny a child of their right to use the bathroom. Then dozens of students abused my policy and I had to crack down.\n\nVaping is very popular now. A lot of students ask to go to the bathroom to vape. The same kids asked if they could use the bathroom every single day (my classes were 45 minutes long), and they would spend at least 10 minutes in the bathroom. Some even spent 20. \n\nUsually if I had a student abuse the privilege, I would tell them \u201cyes, you may go to the bathroom, but this is your last time this week. You will have to go in-between classes or during a different class the remainder of the week.\u201d Usually the kid would flip shit, but I highly suspected they would be vaping instead of using the restroom. \n\nLastly, if a student had a medical issue where they needed to use the restroom on a frequent basis, we were privately notified and I always let them go.", "No, but there were cameras and the counselor was supposed to to be keeping an eye on the halls as supposedly there was some kind of criminal on the loose so we were on a working lockdown. Essentially a criminal was on the loose and we were attempting to keep the kids safe while working. It sucked. Recess was canceled, and we had to escort the children everywhere. Even to places we normally let them go by themselves.", "Totally get that, easier said then done when you have three parents yelling at you and the principal saying you\u2019re now on an improvement plan due to the fight.", "The number of kids who honestly, truly DGAF about their grade would stagger you. At some point it becomes about damage control.", "Same with water breaks. I ALWAYS answer \"can I get water?\" with \"yes, water is life.\" to start with. Eventually for some kiddos this evolves into \"Get water, or fall off the planet till class is almost over like you did twice already this week?\".", "It was the very first class of the day. OP could have used the bathroom before leaving home, or even gone straight to the teacher and told them it was an emergency if they had to go that bad. IF the teacher said no at that point, then yes walking out is the correct action to take.\n\nOP should have taken care of things regarding their period BEFORE leaving the house. Its not like OP went hours without going to the bathroom. It was literally the beginning of the first class, so obviously its suspicious when someone asks to go to the bathroom.", "ANY teacher should know it\u2019s a possibility issue, regardless of gender.", "Yes. Good lord. I got my period when I was 11 and I can't even imagine the utter embarrassment of being forced to announce that I was about to bleed through my pants to a classroom full of 6th graders. There are other things that go along with menstruation as well, such as urgent bowel movements for some. When you have to go, you have to go.", "I mean the teacher still gave OP detention right away. She just didn't do the referral.", "It\u2019s because most people on this subreddit are young (as in 18 or less). As we get older, we start to realize all the shit our teachers are out through and that no, they aren\u2019t all trying their best to make students have a miserable time.", "Because the pass you get doesn't allow it. \n\nWhen my kids were late for school the procedure was office to sign in and then straight to class. They were given a pass specifically for that. \n\nThe hall monitors at the door were teachers and made sure that anyone who entered the building went directly to the office as well.", "School", "Would having someone be a bathroom attendant be of help in a situation like this? I know most schools are understaffed, but I\u2019m talking a hypothetical ideal. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have \u201chall monitors\u201d at my school so I\u2019ve only seen them in tv shows. The idea that students police other students seems counterproductive. But having an actual adult make sure kids aren\u2019t loafing around or getting into trouble seems like a good idea.", "Genuinely it did become that. I had three parents yelling at me, a principal telling me I was on an improvement plan because of the fight, oh and there was some kind of criminal on the loose so we were on some kind of working lockdown, so the school got lectured by the cops. It was a horrible week.", "And I answer the opposite, lol. I almost never question the bathroom, but for water it can wait 5 or 10 minutes. If they insist, I say \"it takes 3 days to die from lack of water\".", "They were on their period. You can use the bathroom all you want at home and then suddenly gush and need to change your pad or tampon or whatever. It's not about how long it's been since they peed last.\n\nPeople can hear you when you talk to the teacher, no matter how quiet you talk. Most teenagers don't want to say \"I'm about to bleed through my leggings\" in front of their classmates.\n\nSeriously, do you have a period?", "You don\u2019t always realize you need to go. Speaking from experience, I have really shit introspection (basically I can\u2019t always tell what my body needs). It\u2019s very common with neurodivergent people, but it also happens with neurotypical people too. I don\u2019t notice I have to go to the bathroom until it\u2019s an emergency.

You\u2019re making this judgement after you\u2019ve had time to think the situation over.\n\nIt looks like the teacher has now had time to think it over, and has realized that they were wrong", "Oh you\u2019d be surprised.  Judging by the comments I see, a lot of them are parents who are outraged that teachers don\u2019t do a good enough job raising their kids for them, but who are also outraged whenever the teachers try to impose any form of discipline whatsoever.", "They normally assign a teacher or a TA to stand at the bathroom door between classes. But knowing kids, they'd probably call having an attendant there \"creepy\" and either fart them out or complain enough that the attendant gets removed. In theory, it would probably help, especially when that deviant lick crap was going on and students were causing thousands of dollars in property damage. In practice, good luck.", "We were told to call admin if a student who was known for vaping needed to go to the bathroom, but often times admin was busy dealing with another issue and couldn\u2019t. Parents would also state that it\u2019s violating their privacy to have a constant bathroom attendant, if schools even had the staffing for it in the first place.", "Then the teacher should have sought out OP and cancelled the detention", "Did you read the post? They did.", "No they didn't give a \"referral\" which I'm guessing is some kind of write-up system that is separate from the detention? Unless they are both the same thing and OP just used two different words.", "A referral is not detention. It\u2019s basically just a warning", "Okay, so I'm saying the teacher did not go through with the referral, but also did not rescind the detention. If the teacher realized she was wrong, she should have gone to OP and rescinded the detention."]}
