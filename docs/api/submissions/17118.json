He is 27 and again carless??!!  Hide your keys. If your parents feel so bad they can lend him one of their vehicles.  It is time for him to grow up and fund his own life. He can get a bicycle or take Uber or a Taxi to work.    They are gaslighting you into thinking that you are wrong when you are being reasonable.  Why should you risk your hard earned vehicle for someone who is incapable or being responsible with a vehicle?", "If your parents are soo supportive maybe they should loan him their car?", "NTA. Your parents should lend him their car if they're so concerned. They did say \"family should help each other\", and they're his family.\n\nDon't lend him your car. Perhaps he could find a beater on Craigslist.", "Tell your parents they can either shut tf up about it or lend him their car. They have no right to make demands on you, especially on something that you\u2019ve paid for, given prior history with said brother.

If your parents think family should help then they can loan him a car", "NTA - just say your insurance won\u2019t cover him because he\u2019s under 30.", "NTA Tell your parents that they an lend him their car instead, because he's already totalled one of your cars and shown no remorse and despite what they think you've already gone above and beyond for him in the past so time for them to put up or shut up.", "NTA \u2026 Tell your parents to buy him a cheap used car if they think family should be there for each other. \n\nYou did your family duty when you let him use your old car and he failed as a family member by wrecking it and showing no real remorse", "NTA\n\nIf he's changed so much he can buy your car off of you or your supportive parents can buy it for him. Then it's no longer your car or your concern what happens to it.", "NTA.  If he paid for the damages then maybe.  But as it is that\u2019s a big huge NO. \n\nYour parents favor him terribly.  He\u2019s 27 that\u2019s way way too old for this nonsense.", "NTA. Don't give him your car and don't give into the ridiculous pressure from your family.

The last time you helped him out in a hard time, he created a hard time for you, during which he didn\u2019t even offer help or try to make it right. There\u2019s no indication he won\u2019t do the same again.

Trust has to be earned.", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.  Not only has your brother not shown you any personal growth, he hasn't had the common decency to show repentance by apologizing.  Given this lack of consideration and respect, tell your parents that THEY can help out your brother.  \n\nI'm guessing that you do not live with your parents or your brother.

I don\u2019t lend my car to anyone - well if my kid needs to use my truck, then we swap vehicles for those few hours.
