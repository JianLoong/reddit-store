I am the stepmother to D, who is 17, graduating high school. My husband (M44) is a 100% total and permanent disabled combat war veteran. He has been separated from D's mother, P, since 2011. We met in 2013, got married in 2015 and I have been in D's life ever since.\n\nTo make a long story short, D's mother, P, has a degree she doesn't use. Has over $120k in student loans and had to \"struggle\". So naturally, D thinks she has to take out student loans and struggle too. But she doesn't. I am a School Certifying Official at a community college, certifying Veterans and Military Education benefits to the Veteran Affairs. I KNOW what benefits are out there for my stepdaughter due to her father's service connected disability. My stepdaughter is eligible for CH 35, or Dependents Education Assistance benefit which is a monthly stipend paid to my stepdaughter, plus a state benefit that is a tuition waiver up to 8 semester/4 years. It covers all tuition & fees, just not books or campus housing or food plans. \n\nEach of these benefits take anywhere from 45-90 days. I have urged my stepdaughter to apply after her 18th birthday later this month, so her applications can be processed before she starts school in August at the university of her choice. She has been accepted to a $25k per semester university, where freshmen must stay on campus and have a meal plan and etc. D, has asked me and her father to co-sign on student loans because her mother REFUSES to. We have spoken to her time and time again about applying for these VA Educational Benefits and she claims her mother is telling that she would not qualify for them. Which is false, this is my job, I know the ins and outs of these benefits like the back of my hand. My husband and I are not in a place to co-sign student loans, because my husband is still fulfilling his child support obligation until D has finished her undergrad. D has said that it is a \"waste of her time\" to apply for these benefits, despite the fact she is eligible for it. \n\nMy husband and I have told her no, we will not co-sign on student loans when she could very well have her tuition paid for. She is just....refusing to listen to us and is listening to her mother, which is going to bite her in the butt. Her mother is telling her that I/we are wrong, when I have worked this job for 12 years and know what I'm talking out.\n\nNow D is unbelievably pissed at us. Claims we are \"ruining\" her future, how is she going to afford college, etc. I feel for her, I love her, but I am also not about to co-sign on loans when she has these benefits at the will ready for her to use due to her father's time in the service. \n\nAITA reddit?", "created_utc": 1686246732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144g225/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_im_not_paying/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants my husband and I to co-sign student loans to afford her \"dream school\" and refuses to listen to me/us and apply for these benefits. We cannot, and will not, co-sign these loans and she is angry at us (so is her mother). We feel like assholes, because we want her to achieve this dream and reach her higher education goals, but since her mother \"struggled\" and had to take out student loans, D must feel like she has to \"struggle\" too.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It just seems weird that D/her mom are so adamant that she isn't eligible. The application can't be any more complicated/effort than applying for student loans.", "NTA   \n\n\nTell her you will reconsider helping her in any capacity if she applies for those benefits. They cost her nothing but time and if she does get denied then she still loses nothing", "Nta-I\u2019m not sure why D won\u2019t even apply, this is a lot of money, if I were you I\u2019d tell her you\u2019ll co-sign only if she is rejected for this benefit you know she qualifies for", "NTA.  She appears to be a little too slow to attend college.  Do you have a co-worker that could explain the process to her for a third party opinion?  That might sway her.  But the bottom line?  I would never co-sign a student loan.", "NTA.  D is taking bad advice.  You should not have to go into debt when it is unnecessary.  Print out the info and present it to her.  Tell her you would be happy to help her apply if she is having difficulty doing so but let her know that is the limit of your responsibility.", "NTA - Applying shouldn't be that much of a hassle for her. Sounds like you're familiar with the process, so you could make it even easier. Applying for scholarships and benefits is not an unreasonable ask when you're the one paying for college.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your stepdaughter is being wilfully ignorant. She's a (young) adult and unfortunately it sounds like she's about to get a big lesson in consequences.", "NTA\n\nIn retrospect, I wish some people had talked to me when I was younger about the seriousness of student loan debt.  When you're so young (18, barely an adult) it is easy to think about it like it's normal, not a big deal, once you get your degree you will make more money and paying off your loans will be easy, but in reality, as millions of us have now found out, that is often not the case and you end up with a potentially massive amount of debt hanging over your head before you are even in the workforce.\n\nIn this case, it seems like you've done a good job both of warning her, but also of telling/showing her that there are grant and scholarship options that she can take advantage of, and even helping her with the application process.  I wish I would have had someone do that for me!  I have a disability and could have potentially qualified for a lot of grants/scholarships but at the time I didn't know anything about that stuff and never took advantage of it, and in the long run it has cost me a lot of money.  \n\nWhat I think would be the fairest compromise would be to tell her that if she applies for the benefits that she is eligible for, you would be willing to co-sign for any additional loans she needs to take out if the benefits aren't enough to cover all of her costs/expenses (she may need some additional money for living expenses, etc.).  It's really pretty dumb of her not to take advantage of those benefits though but when you are 18, you tend to make some pretty dumb decisions.", "NTA. Why on earth would you cosign on a loan for someone who is refusing free money?", "NTA but can't you help fill them out for her since she's your tax dependent?", "NTA-  sometimes people even 17 year olds get stuck.\n\nShe believes her mother wouldn\u2019t lie, but her mother is wrong.  She is not listening to you.  Can you get yourself, your husband, her , and her mother together with of your coworkers in a conference to go over options?\n\nMaybe if it isn\u2019t coming from you but a third party her mom would listen?", "NTA. Perhaps present it to her this way: What does she have to lose by filling out these applications? \"Honey, fill out the applications. If your mom is right, we'll talk about next steps.\" But you know her mom isn't right.", "NTA  Sit her down and tell her, I know you don't think you are eligible for any benefits, but do me a favor and apply anyway. Who knows what will happen, and wouldn't it be great if you end up with money you don't have to pay back.\n\nI understand that you are sure she will be eligible, but she believes what her mother is saying, and she might be acting stubborn because otherwise it means her mother is lying to her. \n\nIt's not ideal, but it might get her to apply.", "NTA. You're helping her to the best of your ability.", "NTA but real question here. Does her mom actually love her? Like what kind of parent tells their kid no don't use these resources to help you because I didn't and my life is now shit so your life has to be shit too.", "NTA. You really tried to help point her to the resources. If she won't listen and take advantage of them and prefers to take out loans, it's just epically stupid on her part... but you don't have any reason to join in that stupidity by co-signing.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you go in debt when you don't have to? Can you tell her that you can talk about co-signing if she applies and doesn't make it? Filling out some forms might \"waste time\" but on a $25k bet I'd say it's worth it. \n\nLastly, Can you or her father fill out the forms for her? I know you \"shouldn't\" have to, but it might be the easiest solution.", "NTA\n\nTell her that the only way you'll pay her tuition is if she proves you wrong and her mom right. Obviously you know she'll get the benefits, so there's no real risk to this \"gamble,\" just sucks that you have to jump through extra hoops.", "NTA. It\u2019s too much money to make such an error of judgement. Is there someone else outside the family that could go through this with her so she understands the options and financial implications? Might be worth paying a college or financial advisor. Feels like the personal stuff between the parents is clouding her understanding of the situation, which is admittedly complex for a 17 year old.", " NTA  but why not download the form and you and husband fill it out? You know most, if not all, of the information being asked. Then sit her down and tell her let\u2019s please give this a shot. She has nothing to lose from trying.  It\u2019s bizarre she doesn\u2019t believe you. Have you asked her why she doesn\u2019t believ you considering your background?", "Nta\n\nI don't understand her logic.", "Sit down with her and help her apply.", "INFO: Have you and your husband sat down with D's mother to discuss this? They should have had some sort of plan in place before the divorce, but that's a moot point now. \n\nThis sounds like the four of you should sit down together. I would suggest all of the parents sit down together first to be on the same page. Then, the four of you sit down to discuss. \n\nBecause D running back and forth to carry the messages is causing unnecessary drama when the adults can sit down and talk it out.\n\nIf for some reason that is impossible, Tell D that it costs her nothing to apply for the benefits so if they don't work out no harm no foul. But, if it does, she can have her tuition paid for and not have to worry about \"ruining\" her future. \n\nI'm actually shocked that she is so stubborn about this. Don't kids getting ready for college still look for every scholarship or grant they can apply for? Is that not a thing anymore? Because D should have been applying for it regardless of what she thinks the odds are. \n\nThere is something fishy happening here. Why would her mother discourage her daughter from at least trying to get the benefit? And why is D so stubbornly sure that applying for it would be pointless? None of this makes any sense and D sounds woefully unprepared to be out on her own.", "NTA.  At the very least she should look into it herself to see which is true.", "NTA for not signing the loans, but a little eh... at expecting her to navigate all this as a 17 year old with zero experience. Can you not sit down with her and do all the applications?", "NTA... there is no logic to paying when she can fill out forms for benefits", "NTA. My family is also entitled to Chap 35 benefits due to my husband's service. There is absolutely no reason she should accept this GUARANTEED benefit. Tell her to apply, and if she is not approved, you'll consider co-signing (knowing full well she'll be approved).", "NTA. You gave D extremely clear and specific steps she has to take to pay for college, she for some reason decided instead of doing any of this she could just get a loan and make you responsible for repaying it if she doesn't. She's an adult now, it's time to make adult decisions and face adult consequences. She decided not to seek any of the assistance available to her, and these are the consequences.\n\nI might feel a little differently (but not much) if you could easily afford to cosign or even pay for her, and were *only* witholding it to \"teach her a lesson,\" but $200k for a 4-year degree is a metric fuckton of debt to be saddled with, *especially* to be saddled with it on behalf of a person who has already shown she does not take responsibility for her own debts.", "NTA, ridiculous of D to both not listen to you and expect you to co-sign at the same time, she should at least TRY it your way", "NTA\n\nShe may honetly not fully understand they benefits she is entitled to. Is tere a way oyu can print out the forms and sit down with her and go through them together? Show and explain to her with visuals that she is entitled to all of these things?\n\nI owuld als onot co-sign on loans when education can be paid for by benefits or bursaries etc. \n\nAt the same time, you can't help her if she is unwilling ot listen, she isn't a baby anymore, and be helped. She may resent you for a short time but you can be sure she'll eventually resent her mother for convincing her to not apply to such things.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll admit that at 17 I would have had absolutely no idea how to navigate the benefit process. Question- if she applied, and for some reason didn\u2019t qualify, would you then agree to sign the loans?", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank your DH for his service. \n\nSecond, I think the new rules are that parent has to be obligor, not co-signer (not that I would do either)\n\nThird, I do not mean to get personal, but what school is 25K per semester.   Surely she has options of other schools, is this school so special?  Most of the really good schools give really good aid (e.g., MIT, Ivies, etc).   So this makes no sense to me.  \n\nFourth, is there any possibility your DH can get his support order amended, so any CS goes to kids college?", "Wow, looks like mom is actively trying to sabotage her own daughter!!\n\nHer mom has gaslit or in the very least manipulated her daughter into thinking she HAS to suffer with student loan debt when she literally doesn't.\n\nI wonder, couldn't the dad just apply for her? I \"helped\" my son apply for plenty of programs when he started college last year (which was really him watching me do it and signing at the end, lol)", "So what exactly is stopping you from filling out the forms for her? It's all online right? You have all her information right? Why not show her instead of trying to beat the dead horse? I'm not gonna call you TA for wanting her to do for herself, or being unwilling to cosign the loans for her, but damn, you spent as long typing this up and replying to people as it would've taken to complete the form and submit it for her. NTA, but don't lose this relationship over something fixable.", "NTA- I'd just tell D in the simplest terms.  Your mother is wrong, this is what I do for a living. You are the one making the choice here. The money is available to you, but not via a co-sign.  Do you want the money, yes or no? if yes, then I'll help you fill it out. otherwise, what will you do? The choice is yours and yours alone, and so will be the consequences of the choice if you choose poorly. So, what's it gonna be?  You enrolling for August or you wanna sit around with your mom and be pissed for no reason?", "NTA.  You laid out her options and at this point she's being stubborn and lazy.", "NTA. I think your stepdaughter isn't smart enough for college. Instead of using the benefits her father got when he served in the military to fully pay for her college, she wants to take out very expensive student loans. Yeah I wouldn't cosign that stupidity either. If she wants to get over $100k in student loans then she has to do that on her own.", "Kinda sorta NTA\u2026\u2026But\u2026\u2026\n\nYour stepdaughter is in a terrible position.  She is (probably not for the first time) stuck between opposing sides and cannot please those most important to her.  I\u2019m sure she would love to be able to just say \u201cfu@k y\u2019all\u201d.  Maybe you can Fill out the paperwork for her.  Ask her to sign it, telling her it\u2019s between the two of you only.  Can you imagine having someone you love and trust telling you college is a waste of time, because they are not good at their life choices?  Someone needs to really help this child make good life choices and not criticize them for being placed between crazy mom and completely cement confident stepmom.", "For the issue of refusing student loans, NTA.\n\nFor the issue of giving minimal guidance, YTA\n\nTelling her the tools exist is different than teaching her how to use them. 4/10 parenting.", "How is she going to graduate college when she\u2019s not even got the intelligence to listen on this? \n\nNTA", "The mom is planning on taking her money.

OP also said that she and her husband would provide all the necessary documentation, and all the step-daughter needs to do is fill out the applications and send them in. I'm sure OP would be fine answering any questions she may have, but it's not unreasonable to expect that she does the rest on her own considering that she's now an adult and moving out on her own.", "Yeah her mother tells her (and me whenever she gets the chance) how she's \"still paying off a worthless art degree\" and how she had to \"work hard and make something of herself\" and loves to tell tales of woe about how she has an art degree and will probably be paying off her student loans until she dies. Which sucks. But she's also refusing to offer any assistance to D, refuses to even give her tax info for FAFSA, thinks it's also a waste of time and has D so convinced she has to take out loans and struggle like she did. Can I fill out the forms for D? Yeah I can, it takes all of 10-15 minutes to go to va.gov and complete the application, but my husband and I feel like this is something she needs to do if she wants to go to a private university that charges close to $25k per semester for freshmen. She won't even consider Community College because it's \"beneath her\" because that's what her mom told her", "I agree.  I think the problem is that the kids are young and inexperienced with money, and because they won't have to actually start paying for several years, it makes them very easy to ignore/disregard the huge amount of money that they are committing to repay, and what benefit they are really getting by choosing the more expensive schools.  If someone really explained it to them, they might understand, but they're excited and na\u00efve and get swept up in the excitement of going off to college and it doesn't really sink in until they graduate and it is too late.  \n\nTBH I think a lot of student loan programs are a borderline form of predatory lending.", "12k for a community college. She's going to university, doubling that number isn't crazy.", "I'm in a high COL state, and tuition for state universities here is about $25k for 2 semesters (one year). Tuition + housing for one semester is about $25k.\n\nHowever, both of my kids attend a private college here, and \"MSRP\" for a year of tuition at their university is about $60k, which does **NOT** include housing, so it's very possible that tuition for OP's stepdaughter is indeed $25k for one semester. That being said, neither one of my kids actually gets charged the full price of tuition due to scholarships and assistance based on financial need. In fact, what they're actually paying is slightly less than what they'd pay to attend a state university because of the scholarships and assistance received.", "Exactly. It's $1401 per month if the student is a full time student. That would be so helpful, especially when it comes to living expenses. I've offered to sit down beside her and walk her through the application, answer any questions she may have, but she refuses to listen to me/her father, who is the only person/reason she even is eligible for this benefit", "If D wants to blow up her relationship with her stepmother because *she* didn't feel like doing 10 minutes of research to look into the benefits that her stepmother has handed to her on a silver platter, then that's her choice, and she'll regret it one day when she's hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for no reason. \n\n> I wouldn't let my kids suffer for that, would you? \n\nYes. If my kids are so sure X person is correct about something to the point that they're not even willing to do the slightest amount of research into the benefits I'm telling them they qualify for, then they can take out loans for college. That's their choice.", "Yeah, I really don't understand why OP hasn't just filled out the online forms already. I worked at an admissions office for a couple years at a big school. The number of parent's who are filling out everything is not small, it's expected.", "Yeah, don't really know for sure and it does say she \"refuses\" in the post, but most lenders only want co-signers that actually have money.", "Then rephrase it: \"You staying in this house and seeing continued support past 18 is contingent upon going through this process.\"", "Sounds like you've tried, not your fault she refuses to listen", "So let her see that she won\u2019t be going off to college in the fall, and maybe she\u2019ll be willing to fill out the forms to start in the spring or the following fall. Natural consequences. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that they\u2019re disrespecting your knowledge about this. People who know the ins and outs of how to apply for different kinds of benefits are *gold.*", "Seems so weird... I just don't understand why she would be so resistant when she has sooooo much to gain.  Yeah, filling out forms is a pain but the expenses that will be covered will equal out hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It'll probably take her over a decade to pay off loans for expenses that she could/should have gotten for free.  \n\nShe needs to talk to one of the millions of people in their 20s and 30s who are getting absolutely ruined by their student loan debt for a reality check.", "Exactly.", "If they have to do all that why is she going to college. She needs to go back to elementary", "Perhaps OP also wants her to take responsibility. If she can\u2019t do this, why would anyone want to pay for her anyway? She won\u2019t do well if she refuses to do basic work like this.", "I mean, if she's a stickler for the rules the kid could just do the esig while she fills out everything else.", ">Can I fill out the forms for D? Yeah I can\n\nThen go do it! please don't watch your stepdaughter start her life hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to teach her a lesson. There is no benefit to that lesson.", "sounds like she has some serious growing up to do.", "Yth. You have the ability to help her and you're not. That makes you an alter asshole. Navigating government websites can be incredibly complex. You know what you're doing. You can sit down with her and actually help her fill out the forms.", "haha, I would not say borderline. \n\nThere is a book I think may be worth this kid reading, called Payng for the Party by Elizabeth Armstrong.  While much of it deals with the costs of sororities (in time and money), there are parts about how student debt negatively impacts people.  How a combination of less than marketable majors and student debt can really impact kids.", "OP says 25K per semester.  You are saying 8K per YEAR (1K for one course, which is 1/4 of what FT would be, so 4K per semester or 8K per year.  But OK, lets say 12 per year).    That is 4 times as much\n\nNow, I suspect some of the difference is your living at home, and MANY in state schools are less than 12K, BUT my point is the kid is spending too much (unless really great school)", "Oh, I am not saying not possible.  I am just saying I suspect cheaper alternatives. yes, private can be cheaper, but not if kid wont apply", "No lie, it was a process when we filled out the forms, we finally had to call the va to help us to which she did and she told us there was a backlog.\n\nMy daughter got about that amount and she was able to rent a place close to campus as well as buy some of her supplies (though she wasted some on hoodies and college themed clothes lol )\n\nI hope she figures out that she would benefit from it no lie, my daughter said it literally saved her from starvat!on (she was a drama major as you can see lol )", ">she'll regret it one day when she's hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for no reason.\n\nHow will she regret it? At that point she'll have never been proven wrong. I'm sorry that you don't feel it necessary to try and protect children from themselves, but I'll die on this hill. It shouldn't be necessary to fill out the forms for her, I'll agree with that. But I see absolutely no benefit to trying to teach this lesson.  ETA: Lessons need a benefit. If the only possible outcome of a lesson is negative, you need to find a new one.", "Or even \"Sit down with us and apply for DEA/Ch35, and if you don't qualify we can talk about maybe cosigning for student loans\"", "I mean some people actually like their kids and want to help them succeed but I'm not shocked other redditors don't agree", "She\u2019s 17 and one of her parents is actively misinforming her. Give her a break.", "She could, but not only would no one know the difference outside of herself and the kid, no one would care if they did. This kind of stuff happens all the time. Like 50% of parents do the entirety of the FAFSA for their college-age kids. And probably 25% do the college apps (including essay).", ">You have the ability to help her and you're not.\n\nYou are wrong.  OP and husband **ARE** trying to help her out.  Don't you think that if daughter agree to what OP is suggesting that OP wouldn't help her with the forms and all?  Her stepdaughter is choosing to listen to her mother and **NOT** to the person who **ACTUALLY** does this for a living.  As the old saying goes ***\"You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink'\"*** is a proverb which means that you can give someone an opportunity but not force them to take it.", "Yeah, I definitely think there should be more discussion about choosing your major wisely.  I was always told \"just study what you are interested in, once you graduate, you'll find a way to use it in the real world\"... WRONG!  I learned a lot of very interesting stuff that unfortunately has almost no practical value (but it was interesting).\n\nMost liberal arts degrees are barely worth the paper they are printed on and a year later I was going back to law school to get a degree that actually has some real world applications.", "it'd still be 12k with summer classes (which I'm in now), but I get your point. I can tell you that OOS tuition at the school I used to work for is roughly 25k a term, and it was one of the cheaper options in that state.", "\"It'S tHe PrINciPLe\"", "D is choosing to trust her mother over the person who literally works in this field. Thats a stupid decision. She is old enough to know that\u2019s a bad decision. If she\u2019s old enough to go to college, she\u2019s old enough to know that she should bother to do even 5 minutes of research to confirm or deny what her mother is telling her. She\u2019s not a child anymore. She\u2019s going off on her own in the world. It\u2019s time to be a big girl and learn that choices have consequences. \n\nHow far does this go?

OP should not cave on this.", "The op can open up a laptop in front of the daughter. Go to the website. And tell her navigate the forms.

Watching a child trust the wrong person and throw themselves into hundreds of thousands dollars of debt over something you can easily fix is comparable to e-mailing a professor when they turn their assignment in late? The first is a lifetime mistake, the second is a weekly one. The second is a lesson to learn from, the first is a lesson that punishes you forever.", "On the contrary, I think it'd be far more productive than whatever is currently happening, but alrighty", "I think it's fairly productive. You're saving her from most likely a lifetime of debt. You're showing her that she can be wrong, you're showing her that her mother can be wrong (maybe slightly petty, but still a worthwhile lesson), and you're showing her that you can be right, and it really feels like she needs a little bit of that last one in her life. She's not listening to a knowledgeable person about this at all.
