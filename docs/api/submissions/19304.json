I am the stepmother to D, who is 17, graduating high school. My husband (M44) is a 100% total and permanent disabled combat war veteran. He has been separated from D's mother, P, since 2011. We met in 2013, got married in 2015 and I have been in D's life ever since.\n\nTo make a long story short, D's mother, P, has a degree she doesn't use. Has over $120k in student loans and had to \"struggle\". So naturally, D thinks she has to take out student loans and struggle too. But she doesn't. I am a School Certifying Official at a community college, certifying Veterans and Military Education benefits to the Veteran Affairs. I KNOW what benefits are out there for my stepdaughter due to her father's service connected disability. My stepdaughter is eligible for CH 35, or Dependents Education Assistance benefit which is a monthly stipend paid to my stepdaughter, plus a state benefit that is a tuition waiver up to 8 semester/4 years. It covers all tuition & fees, just not books or campus housing or food plans. \n\nEach of these benefits take anywhere from 45-90 days. I have urged my stepdaughter to apply after her 18th birthday later this month, so her applications can be processed before she starts school in August at the university of her choice. She has been accepted to a $25k per semester university, where freshmen must stay on campus and have a meal plan and etc. D, has asked me and her father to co-sign on student loans because her mother REFUSES to. We have spoken to her time and time again about applying for these VA Educational Benefits and she claims her mother is telling that she would not qualify for them. Which is false, this is my job, I know the ins and outs of these benefits like the back of my hand. My husband and I are not in a place to co-sign student loans, because my husband is still fulfilling his child support obligation until D has finished her undergrad. D has said that it is a \"waste of her time\" to apply for these benefits, despite the fact she is eligible for it. \n\nMy husband and I have told her no, we will not co-sign on student loans when she could very well have her tuition paid for. She is just....refusing to listen to us and is listening to her mother, which is going to bite her in the butt. Her mother is telling her that I/we are wrong, when I have worked this job for 12 years and know what I'm talking out.\n\nNow D is unbelievably pissed at us. Claims we are \"ruining\" her future, how is she going to afford college, etc. I feel for her, I love her, but I am also not about to co-sign on loans when she has these benefits at the will ready for her to use due to her father's time in the service. \n\nAITA reddit?", "created_utc": 1686246732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144g225/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_im_not_paying/", "score": 1179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants my husband and I to co-sign student loans to afford her \"dream school\" and refuses to listen to me/us and apply for these benefits. We cannot, and will not, co-sign these loans and she is angry at us (so is her mother). We feel like assholes, because we want her to achieve this dream and reach her higher education goals, but since her mother \"struggled\" and had to take out student loans, D must feel like she has to \"struggle\" too.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It just seems weird that D/her mom are so adamant that she isn't eligible. The application can't be any more complicated/effort than applying for student loans.", "NTA   \n\n\nTell her you will reconsider helping her in any capacity if she applies for those benefits. They cost her nothing but time and if she does get denied then she still loses nothing", "Nta-I\u2019m not sure why D won\u2019t even apply, this is a lot of money, if I were you I\u2019d tell her you\u2019ll co-sign only if she is rejected for this benefit you know she qualifies for", "NTA.  She appears to be a little too slow to attend college.  Do you have a co-worker that could explain the process to her for a third party opinion?  That might sway her.  But the bottom line?  I would never co-sign a student loan.", "NTA.  D is taking bad advice.  You should not have to go into debt when it is unnecessary.  Print out the info and present it to her.  Tell her you would be happy to help her apply if she is having difficulty doing so but let her know that is the limit of your responsibility.", "NTA - Applying shouldn't be that much of a hassle for her. Sounds like you're familiar with the process, so you could make it even easier. Applying for scholarships and benefits is not an unreasonable ask when you're the one paying for college.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your stepdaughter is being wilfully ignorant. She's a (young) adult and unfortunately it sounds like she's about to get a big lesson in consequences.", "NTA\n\nIn retrospect, I wish some people had talked to me when I was younger about the seriousness of student loan debt.  When you're so young (18, barely an adult) it is easy to think about it like it's normal, not a big deal, once you get your degree you will make more money and paying off your loans will be easy, but in reality, as millions of us have now found out, that is often not the case and you end up with a potentially massive amount of debt hanging over your head before you are even in the workforce.\n\nIn this case, it seems like you've done a good job both of warning her, but also of telling/showing her that there are grant and scholarship options that she can take advantage of, and even helping her with the application process.  I wish I would have had someone do that for me!  I have a disability and could have potentially qualified for a lot of grants/scholarships but at the time I didn't know anything about that stuff and never took advantage of it, and in the long run it has cost me a lot of money.  \n\nWhat I think would be the fairest compromise would be to tell her that if she applies for the benefits that she is eligible for, you would be willing to co-sign for any additional loans she needs to take out if the benefits aren't enough to cover all of her costs/expenses (she may need some additional money for living expenses, etc.).  It's really pretty dumb of her not to take advantage of those benefits though but when you are 18, you tend to make some pretty dumb decisions.", "NTA. Why on earth would you cosign on a loan for someone who is refusing free money?", "NTA but can't you help fill them out for her since she's your tax dependent?", "NTA-  sometimes people even 17 year olds get stuck.\n\nShe believes her mother wouldn\u2019t lie, but her mother is wrong.  She is not listening to you.  Can you get yourself, your husband, her , and her mother together with of your coworkers in a conference to go over options?\n\nMaybe if it isn\u2019t coming from you but a third party her mom would listen?", "NTA. Perhaps present it to her this way: What does she have to lose by filling out these applications? \"Honey, fill out the applications. If your mom is right, we'll talk about next steps.\" But you know her mom isn't right.", "NTA  Sit her down and tell her, I know you don't think you are eligible for any benefits, but do me a favor and apply anyway. Who knows what will happen, and wouldn't it be great if you end up with money you don't have to pay back.\n\nI understand that you are sure she will be eligible, but she believes what her mother is saying, and she might be acting stubborn because otherwise it means her mother is lying to her. \n\nIt's not ideal, but it might get her to apply.", "NTA. You're helping her to the best of your ability.", "NTA but real question here. Does her mom actually love her? Like what kind of parent tells their kid no don't use these resources to help you because I didn't and my life is now shit so your life has to be shit too.", "NTA. You really tried to help point her to the resources. If she won't listen and take advantage of them and prefers to take out loans, it's just epically stupid on her part... but you don't have any reason to join in that stupidity by co-signing.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you go in debt when you don't have to? Can you tell her that you can talk about co-signing if she applies and doesn't make it? Filling out some forms might \"waste time\" but on a $25k bet I'd say it's worth it. \n\nLastly, Can you or her father fill out the forms for her? I know you \"shouldn't\" have to, but it might be the easiest solution.", "NTA\n\nTell her that the only way you'll pay her tuition is if she proves you wrong and her mom right. Obviously you know she'll get the benefits, so there's no real risk to this \"gamble,\" just sucks that you have to jump through extra hoops.", "NTA. It\u2019s too much money to make such an error of judgement. Is there someone else outside the family that could go through this with her so she understands the options and financial implications? Might be worth paying a college or financial advisor. Feels like the personal stuff between the parents is clouding her understanding of the situation, which is admittedly complex for a 17 year old.", " NTA  but why not download the form and you and husband fill it out? You know most, if not all, of the information being asked. Then sit her down and tell her let\u2019s please give this a shot. She has nothing to lose from trying.  It\u2019s bizarre she doesn\u2019t believe you. Have you asked her why she doesn\u2019t believ you considering your background?", "Nta\n\nI don't understand her logic.", "Sit down with her and help her apply.", "INFO: Have you and your husband sat down with D's mother to discuss this? They should have had some sort of plan in place before the divorce, but that's a moot point now. \n\nThis sounds like the four of you should sit down together. I would suggest all of the parents sit down together first to be on the same page. Then, the four of you sit down to discuss. \n\nBecause D running back and forth to carry the messages is causing unnecessary drama when the adults can sit down and talk it out.\n\nIf for some reason that is impossible, Tell D that it costs her nothing to apply for the benefits so if they don't work out no harm no foul. But, if it does, she can have her tuition paid for and not have to worry about \"ruining\" her future. \n\nI'm actually shocked that she is so stubborn about this. Don't kids getting ready for college still look for every scholarship or grant they can apply for? Is that not a thing anymore? Because D should have been applying for it regardless of what she thinks the odds are. \n\nThere is something fishy happening here. Why would her mother discourage her daughter from at least trying to get the benefit? And why is D so stubbornly sure that applying for it would be pointless? None of this makes any sense and D sounds woefully unprepared to be out on her own.", "NTA.  At the very least she should look into it herself to see which is true.", "NTA for not signing the loans, but a little eh... at expecting her to navigate all this as a 17 year old with zero experience. Can you not sit down with her and do all the applications?", "NTA... there is no logic to paying when she can fill out forms for benefits", "NTA. My family is also entitled to Chap 35 benefits due to my husband's service. There is absolutely no reason she should accept this GUARANTEED benefit. Tell her to apply, and if she is not approved, you'll consider co-signing (knowing full well she'll be approved).", "NTA. You gave D extremely clear and specific steps she has to take to pay for college, she for some reason decided instead of doing any of this she could just get a loan and make you responsible for repaying it if she doesn't. She's an adult now, it's time to make adult decisions and face adult consequences. She decided not to seek any of the assistance available to her, and these are the consequences.\n\nI might feel a little differently (but not much) if you could easily afford to cosign or even pay for her, and were *only* witholding it to \"teach her a lesson,\" but $200k for a 4-year degree is a metric fuckton of debt to be saddled with, *especially* to be saddled with it on behalf of a person who has already shown she does not take responsibility for her own debts.", "NTA, ridiculous of D to both not listen to you and expect you to co-sign at the same time, she should at least TRY it your way", "NTA\n\nShe may honetly not fully understand they benefits she is entitled to. Is tere a way oyu can print out the forms and sit down with her and go through them together? Show and explain to her with visuals that she is entitled to all of these things?\n\nI owuld als onot co-sign on loans when education can be paid for by benefits or bursaries etc. \n\nAt the same time, you can't help her if she is unwilling ot listen, she isn't a baby anymore, and be helped. She may resent you for a short time but you can be sure she'll eventually resent her mother for convincing her to not apply to such things.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll admit that at 17 I would have had absolutely no idea how to navigate the benefit process. Question- if she applied, and for some reason didn\u2019t qualify, would you then agree to sign the loans?", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank your DH for his service. \n\nSecond, I think the new rules are that parent has to be obligor, not co-signer (not that I would do either)\n\nThird, I do not mean to get personal, but what school is 25K per semester.   Surely she has options of other schools, is this school so special?  Most of the really good schools give really good aid (e.g., MIT, Ivies, etc).   So this makes no sense to me.  \n\nFourth, is there any possibility your DH can get his support order amended, so any CS goes to kids college?", "Wow, looks like mom is actively trying to sabotage her own daughter!!\n\nHer mom has gaslit or in the very least manipulated her daughter into thinking she HAS to suffer with student loan debt when she literally doesn't.\n\nI wonder, couldn't the dad just apply for her? I \"helped\" my son apply for plenty of programs when he started college last year (which was really him watching me do it and signing at the end, lol)", "So what exactly is stopping you from filling out the forms for her? It's all online right? You have all her information right? Why not show her instead of trying to beat the dead horse? I'm not gonna call you TA for wanting her to do for herself, or being unwilling to cosign the loans for her, but damn, you spent as long typing this up and replying to people as it would've taken to complete the form and submit it for her. NTA, but don't lose this relationship over something fixable.", "NTA- I'd just tell D in the simplest terms.  Your mother is wrong, this is what I do for a living. You are the one making the choice here. The money is available to you, but not via a co-sign.  Do you want the money, yes or no? if yes, then I'll help you fill it out. otherwise, what will you do? The choice is yours and yours alone, and so will be the consequences of the choice if you choose poorly. So, what's it gonna be?  You enrolling for August or you wanna sit around with your mom and be pissed for no reason?", "NTA.  You laid out her options and at this point she's being stubborn and lazy.", "NTA. I think your stepdaughter isn't smart enough for college. Instead of using the benefits her father got when he served in the military to fully pay for her college, she wants to take out very expensive student loans. Yeah I wouldn't cosign that stupidity either. If she wants to get over $100k in student loans then she has to do that on her own.", "Kinda sorta NTA\u2026\u2026But\u2026\u2026\n\nYour stepdaughter is in a terrible position.  She is (probably not for the first time) stuck between opposing sides and cannot please those most important to her.  I\u2019m sure she would love to be able to just say \u201cfu@k y\u2019all\u201d.  Maybe you can Fill out the paperwork for her.  Ask her to sign it, telling her it\u2019s between the two of you only.  Can you imagine having someone you love and trust telling you college is a waste of time, because they are not good at their life choices?  Someone needs to really help this child make good life choices and not criticize them for being placed between crazy mom and completely cement confident stepmom.", "For the issue of refusing student loans, NTA.\n\nFor the issue of giving minimal guidance, YTA\n\nTelling her the tools exist is different than teaching her how to use them. 4/10 parenting.", "How is she going to graduate college when she\u2019s not even got the intelligence to listen on this? \n\nNTA", "The mom is planning on taking her money.

I am enormously confused by your stepdaughter's resistance to this. Why does she want to turn down free money? What on Earth is going on? \n\nShe sounds freaked out that the VA benefits won't cover the cost of the school she wants to attend?  Could that happen? It also sounds like she's afraid you will refuse to cosign loans or help in any way if that turns out to be the case. Is there truth to that? Is there a deadline for taking out loans that is incongruent with the notice period for the VA benefits? Could extreme stress or confusion about money be causing her to act illogically?\n\nWith the father being on disability and the mother paying off huge debts, is it possible school already offered an aid package? Sometimes, schools give out grant money, but grant money is reduced for every scholarship or other benefit the student receives.  It's possible VA benefits \"don't matter\" to daughter because they will just 1 to 1 replace institutional support she's already been awarded. \n\nI also wonder if you are obscuring what the real conflict is, at least a little.  Did you really mean to write \"am I the asshole for not wanting to contribute anything at all to her education, because she could go to a state school for free? I know she wants to attend a 50k a year private school, but I wont pay a dime for that\"? Because in that case? Maybe you're a tiny bit the asshole? Typically parents would chip in a little somethin. I'm not saying pay for her 50k/yr private school in full, and by all means warn daughter of the consequences of her taking on that burden herself.  But is the amount you can help with really 0? Or is it 5k? 10k? \n\nI think the best thing for your stepdaughter is to tell her there's a mandatory sit down about planning to pay for college. You all need to make a budget together so you and dad can determine what cash or loan support from you she is getting. Making this budget includes applying for the VA benefits so you can make an informed decision -no ifs, ands, ors, buts.  Spring that part on her after you've already sat down, if necessary. Once youve all filled out all the forms you need to, whip out a spreadsheet and model out the scenarios of attending different schools.  Be explicit. Kids need to know pretty dang close to the exact dollar amount you're willing to chip in. \n\nIf you and these VA benefits and institutional grants won't cover the cost of the school she wants to attend entirely, she has gotta know exactly what that gap is and what next steps are.  Loans she doesn't need a cosigner for are a start. Federal loans do not require parent cosignatures. Her financial aid package should include some amount of those, depending on financial need. Put that into the budget. Now what is the gap? How can she address it? Waitressing over the summer? Now what's the gap with that included? And so on and so forth. \n\nMaybe the reality is she can't afford this private school - you point to the amount of loan she will need a cosigner for and you say \"nuh uh. You are asking me to cosign on you being 150k in debt. I will not do that, for my own financial health and yours.\" At 17 she might not have the resources or understand the process for making that decision, so it could be beneficial to walk her through it.", "NTA\n\nEven if she didn't have this benefit available, it is perfectly FINE for parent to NOT co-sign a 150K+ in student loans, where kid doesn't pay, your credit is trashed, unless you fork up the cash yourself. \n\nLike millions of other high school graduates, she can either look for scholarships& this benefit, get her \\*own loans and go to community college b/c she doesn't have the income & credit to borrow beyond for this 50K a year school. \n\nSounds like she needs to mature a bit before college.

It's kinda dumb but sometimes people need to hear it from a neutral person.", "NTA but it would be idea to fill in as much of the applications as you personally can and tell her you and your partner can only sign on her loans (if you guys are willing) after child support is finished and she is rejected from the benefits", "NTA.  I know it is frustrating but can you sit down and read all the regulations through with her so she can see for herself?", "NTA\n\nAnd I know you shouldn't have to, but can you possibly print out the forms and HAVE HER DAD hand them to her? HE CAN tell her that she needs to try this before she says it won't work. You can also tell her you are willing to help her complete them if she has questions. Then it's up to her to start working on them.\n\nI guess HER DAD can also tell her that - even if she doesn't want to even try for those benefits today - if she decides to try for them within (X amount of time), she will be eligible for those benefits. If she wants to waste time not even trying for those benefits, that's her choice. **Or she can try for those benefits now, and she is guaranteed to absolutely prove one of her parents wrong.**", "Rather than you telling her to go do this, you may find D is much more receptive if her dad asks her to take him to see the campus. While there he can ask to see the Vets center to find out what additional services they can offer D. Once that conversation gets going, when D hears from the nice folks at her college what THEY have to say, she may be more receptive.\n\nTeenagers can get things in their heads that no parent can remove. Outsiders who are subject matter experts? They can get through in a different way since they are not seen as \"Mom telling me to do something\".", "Ugh. There should be more stipulations tied to student loans. Like, regulations on what they can be spent on. Or at least some sort of free seminar on how to use them well. \n\nI had classmates who complained about student loans who bought $2500 MacBooks with the loans. For a degree that didn\u2019t require it! They\u2019ll be paying for that MacBook for the next 50 years.", "I\u2019ve had several family members pay for their degrees by jointing the military. \n\nOne in particular was from a farming family and got a somewhat lucrative degree. He ended up making the 2019 equivalent of $150k-200k a year. I would say that his degree ended up increasing his lifetime earnings by a good $3-5 million by today\u2019s (2019) standard. At least. (I\u2019m using 2019 standards because inflation is crazy these days). \nHe got deployed from the reserves and ended up overseas for 5 years doing a particularly traumatic job. The $3-5 million seems almost insulting when I think about what he went through and the things he saw. It was absolutely awful and no amount of money will ever be able to make that okay. And to think that he was one of the lucky few who had something tangible to show throughout his life for the service he did makes me sick. \n\nOP\u2019s stepdaughter not taking advantage of that money is actually infuriating to me. Her dad deserves to have every penny that he and his family are entitled to because of his disabled veteran status be used.", "It\u2019s an online portal and if she is unable or unwilling, she is too immature for college.", "Not her daughter's problem but hers....", "So, sit in front of the computer together. \n\nYeah, most 17 years olds are not ready/ mature enough for college. in fact, most 17 year olds think they know it all, follow bad advice, and are usually all around stupid. \n\nIf your stepdaughter is stressing out about paying for college, taking on tens of thousands of unnecessary loans, and you can't even sit her down for an hour and show her how it's done... then, yeah, you're AH.", "Man, this is all so incredibly shady. Listen, if I were 17 again and had the opportunity to basically get paid to go to college, I would have filled out those forms as fast as I could. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an element of the ex-wife wanting to punish your husband or negate his service or something. Likes she\u2019s mad at him for being in the military while they were married and becoming disabled. Or, she wants the kid to take out private loans and give her the money. Either way, it\u2019s bad news bears.", "25k total per year if i am  not mistaken, its a shitload of money", "If you can\u2019t fill out online forms to get free money, how are you going to pass any courses? Sounds like she needs to find a job that doesn\u2019t require a degree and save everyone time and money", "YTA. \n\nSeems like your stepdaughter doesn't want to piggyback off her dad's disability, and she likely wants to actually earn her degree, it likely has nothing to do with her mother. Just because her mother didn't use her degree doesn't mean she won't.", "INFO \nIf It somehow turned out she is right and was turned down for the military aid\u2026 would you then co sign?", "Perhaps you can frame this as being very disrespectful to the trauma her father experienced; his service and pain has bought her this windfall, and it's spitting in his face not to accept it.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all.

I looked up CH 35 before commenting and it appears these benefits will be available until she is 26. \n\nShe may have to learn a hard lesson and take a gap year if she does not do those forms. Hold your ground. She may get mad and angry if that happens but the money will still be there next year. So even if she fucks up, she still has a chance to try again later. \n\nDo you happen to know anyone who has used these benefits and might be willing to let you ask them a few questions on audio or video recording to explain how beneficial and simple this was for them? I feel your frustration in wanting to help her and I'm sorry. You're a great stepmom.", "You may need to sit next to her while she is applying on her laptop. I think she does not trust the process. I understand that you want her to be a bit more selfsupporting, but probably because of her mother she is not. You have to initiate every step and go through with  her next to you. I think because it is your job you only can imagine to help her the way you do it at work, but in a family you are able to and  have to give more help.", "NTA - you could approach this a different way though. Tell her you'd cosigner the loan IF her application is rejected.\n\nYou could also show her the information online / talk to the VA together", "NTA \n\n100% this mother is trying to get her daughter to take out loans so she can use the money for her own benefit. I used to debt collect for student loans (I hated myself too, don't worry) and saw this a billion times over.", "NTA how can you \u201cruin her life \u201c when she won\u2019t follow your advice?

I\u2019m at a loss as to why she is so adamant about this", "Co-sign loans or fill out the FASA which isn\u2019t a loan but a requirement to determine eligibility for student loans?

Now, along with a few autoimmune diseases, those old injuries have had me stuck in bed for 5 years... and not the kind where I could get up and walk through a chocolate factory... no matter how many golden tickets Charlie finds.", "You said that she will get benefits because her father is PWD. It's only right that you don't allow her to have student loans because you will also shoulder the payment.", "NTA, it is absolutely unhinged that she will not even try to apply for benefits. It can't be so much work and it would be so much better than loans", "NTA", "NTA and maybe with her student loans she wants to pay off her moms debt? Could this be possible?

It\u2019s all a scam.", "This sounds like the most plausible explanation.", "She doesn't understand student loans and is probably being told she won't have to pay and can leave dad on the hook for her loans.
