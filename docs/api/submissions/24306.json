She likes nightlife with clubs and drinking while I would rather do just about anything else.\n\nMy husband and I come from poor backgrounds. My parents came into a bit of money after our kids were born and we let them sometimes spoil us Ex: paid trips. A much needed new car, clothes for the kids, designer purse. (I'm only mentioning this because it's relevant)\n\nWhen they showed up to the party all was fine. We were having a good time and since our kids had fun.\nAt one point I had went to get out some hard lemonade (which I never would have gotten and only did because this friend said she wanted some) out of the coolers. I handed her one and she said\n\"Girl, I think I want some wine too.\" \n\n\"Uh, okay, I think we have a few bottles in the china cabinet.\" (My husband and I dont really drink so we were given bottles before that we never opened)\n\nWe go to said cabinet and I take out the two bottles we have. Looks at them then me and says \"I know you aren't offering me this crap when you have three bottles of Clase Azul in there.\"\n\nHere's the thing, two of those are empty because my husband got them at a job he worked and wanted to use them for pictures. The other is an unopened bottle that we are saving for a very VERY special occasion. I have never even tasted it. I told her as much and she got angry. \n\nShe started throwing all my \"weath\" back at me. Now, I'll accept that my parents do spoil us but it's to a certain point. But we do not rely on them for everything. In fact we make a point of paying for all our bills, insurance, food, household goods &c by ourselves. So what she said hit a nerve with me. \n\nI told her there was no way in hell I was opening that bottle at a 10 year olds birthday party. She said she would probably never get the chance to even taste it in any other setting and I was being a \"bad friend\". \nMy husband came over due to all the yelling and found out what was going on. He sided with me and told her we weren't opening that and that she already made us buy the hard lemonades and we weren't \"feeding her alcoholism\" anymore. \n\nShe seemed embarrassed so she stopped and we went about the party.\n\nNow shes been texting me telling me Im TA and a bad friend for not opening the bottle for her. That they had traveled 3 hours to see us and it was the least I could do. \n\nShe really hasn't let this go, though. She keeps telling me I'm TA but I can't see it. I don't even know if its that big of a deal. For the life of me I really don't think what I did was wrong but she even got her friends to send me messages calling me a \"privileged bitch\" and \"not sharing the wealth with my friends.\"\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691631060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15my6n8/aita_for_not_opening_a_very_expensive_bottle_of/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I siphon it into used wine bottles and store it in the cold cellar. When we have a bunch of people over (party time!) we decant it into 3-4 one litre pitchers and spread them out around the kitchen and living room. It is decent table wine, people like it.
