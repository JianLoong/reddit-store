It\u2019s not hard.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nUnlike you, who can take breaks at any time, who has the liberty of being a business owner, your wife has to take lunches at certain times, she has to schedule as she has to answer to someone else.\n\nYou offered to take her to lunch at a particular time.  She made the time.  Not her fault that you were not ready and then turn around brush her off in favor of an employee who was running late?  And yet you do not see where you are wrong, even making a suggestion she eat hot dogs?  Rude is the understatement of the day by her.\n\nIf my spouse told me that, care to guess what I would make my spouse for dinner, since I do alot of cooking in the house?  I can tell you that my meal would be hot and nice smelling.  My spouse would be pointed to the kitchen and told to make it themselves.  And the same is true for my spouse, if I tried that, I can tell you that I would find the couch real uncomfortable.\n\nYou owe her an apology OP, and you need to make it up to HER", "I", "YTA", "You might be eating weiners for all meals the next few months. Don\u2019t be surprised.", "Yta. She clearly didn't want a fucking hot dog. Did you want a hot dog??", "Yeah YTA. You invited her to lunch, then told her to stay home because you and your employee didn't manage your time effectively and she had a meeting after lunch she was concerned about missing. You were more than rude, you were disrespectful. Her time is just as important as yours.", "YTA. You invited her for lunch, shoplifted her time, then told her she could just stay home when she got irritated, and I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t have your employee take a break for lunch to accommodate your wife\u2019s schedule. From the way you tell the story, she was actually looking forward to having lunch with you.", "You were being rude. You made it seem like it was a nice gesture, but then you clearly  minimised her schedule and her time. You should have made it clear when you offered what time you would (or might) leave. When your employee was taking extra time and your wife expressed that she might miss it due to her meeting, you could have been apologetic and said sorry it\u2019s not working out. Instead you weren\u2019t clear, kept saying \u201cshortly\u201d and then got upset with her (when clearly she was getting understandably upset with the lack of clarity on the timing) and said something really rude. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou disrespected her time and then were rude to her when you and your employee weren't ready on time.  You should've offered to do a rain check on lunch with your wife when you couldn't go on time.", "Yes, YTA; you invited her out, did not make sure the plans were convenient, and then made her switch her lunch plans last minute.", "Is the employee an attractive woman? Enquiring minds want to know. If the answer is yes and you're wondering why your wife is upset, well ding ding ding, we have a winner. ESH", "Duh\u2026YTA. Your employee couldn\u2019t finish their work after they got back? Then you got snippy with your wife when she asked if you\u2019re ready. You then told her to eat hot dogs. \n\nYou have a lot of making up to do.", "YTA. You handled this poorly and didn't take her job into account. You should've offered to bring her something back if your employee was making you late to lunch.", "Yta for your comment.", "YTA\n\n\"Sorry, I don't think we're going to finish in time for you to come too since we're running late, and you've got a meeting. You might want to go ahead and get food without us. We could also bring you home something from the restaurant if you'd like.\"\n\nThere. That's the correct response. Mission accomplished, no rudeness needed.", "YTA.  Do you even like your wife?", "The \u201ceat hot dogs or something\u201d line is so weird lol but NTA. The wife sounds like she overreacted/inappropriately reacted to the timing.\n\nBy chance do you all own a client-service agency of some sort? This reminds me a lot of working at creative agencies, I worked for a lot of smaller ones back in the day with husband and wife teams.\n\nMy first thought was the employee\u2019s work was time-sensitive and needed to be send to the client before they left for lunch. This isn\u2019t unusual at all in a lot of my work settings, and I wouldn\u2019t have been upset at my partner for it.", "YTA, You could have offered  to being something back. :/ like seriously. Not hard.", "YTA. You strung her along. I would\u2019ve been upset too. Was it more than 20 minutes between her asking? You kept telling her \u201cWe\u2019ll be done shortly.\u201d You should\u2019ve just told her it wouldn\u2019t work out like you had hoped and offered to bring her something from the restaurant. Snapping at her after she\u2019s already upset was a huge AH move. Go eat a hot dog or something OP.", "YTA- there was no need to be snotty to your wife like that. I can see why she was offended. You told her she could just go eat hotdogs or something, if she had a problem. Rude. Dismissive. You\u2019re the one who invited her, knowing she had a meeting. We all have bad days, but you can hardly be shocked and awed that your spouse wouldn\u2019t appreciate an attitude.", "OP, just own that you don't like your wife. Leave (permanently or just for the day) so she can eat lunch on her own breadwinning schedule rather than relying on your BS.", "I mean sounds like his isn\u2019t going to be getting eaten anytime soon so \ud83d\ude0f", "Yeah, also why did he feel the need to infantalize his wife like that.  \u201cIf you\u2019re getting upset\u201d is just such a dismissive way to begin a sentence.", "There you go. Sometimes timing doesn\u2019t work out but the rudeness was a choice.", "His own job performance is more important than his wife\u2019s or he would\u2019ve been considerate of her meeting schedule.", "To me it wasn\u2019t about not taking her to lunch; it was about his \u201cdeliverance\u201d of \u201cyou can make hot dogs or something\u201d which screamed to me he had an attitude from the start.", "He and employee were going to lunch when they finished their tasks, he asked if wife wanted to go with them when they went......after they were finished with their work. Unfortunately the times didn't sync up", "Your first question is a good one. OP stated the employee is male in another comment. Why would gender and age matter anyways? Why does he have to sleep on the couch? Why can't she? Because he is a man? Fuck that. That's his bed, too. If my wife doesn't want to sleep next to me because she is mad, she can sleep somewhere else; I won't.", "Do you mean asininity? I tried looking up what your word meant and didn't find the exact match so I think you spelt it wrong", "This is the craziest leap and projection I have seen on AITA yet.  For what it\u2019s worth, OP commented (before you) that employee is a male.", "Yeah this was the YTA moment for me. He talked down to her like a child when she was clearly upset and feeling dismissed. My guess is this isn\u2019t the first time he has brushed her off when she shows emotions.", "Yup definitely YTA for that statement alone.  So many ways this could go without him being a prick about it.", "Assholery...", "I was wondering how long it would be before someone made this accusation lol", "Such as offering to bring her something back if she couldn\u2019t go", "And hot dogs of all things too. Like damn.", "That\u2019s a pretty big presumption.", "I mean it was more so him and the employee were getting lunch and asked the wife if she wanted to go. Turns out she couldn\u2019t go because of a meeting. I doubt he knows exactly what time every day she has meetings from.", "That\u2019s because you\u2019re an adult who has a job, unlike most of the comments on here.  I swear that sometimes these posts need an age next to the responses.", "Same, and honestly it just sounds like creative agency culture too. I\u2019ve worked for lots of small ones owned by a husband and wife team and this is the arrangement too. My first thought was that the work the employee was doing was a project in-flight and about to get sent to a client so it had to be finished before they left. That isn\u2019t weird at all in my social or work circle.", "I absolutely think he was the AH in this scenario, but I don\u2019t think to accommodate his wife he should then be an AH and ditch out on the employee he offered to take to lunch first. \n\nHe should have apologized that the timing isn\u2019t working out for her to go, and offer an alternative such as bringing her something back or ordering her something to be delivered. Not make her sound like a child who can\u2019t control their emotions, and tell her to go eat hot dogs. \n\nBetter communication needed to happen on both sides. He should have let her know as soon as he realized they weren\u2019t leaving when planned, so maybe she didn\u2019t go through the trouble to get ready. She also should have let him know of her need to return by a certain time.", "But it\u2019s OP and the employee\u2019s lunch that the wife is tagging along on, not the other way around. He could also go with wife any day. Not saying OP handled it well, but waiting for employee isn\u2019t unreasonable when that is the primary lunch guest.", "I mean that\u2019s fair too but generally if someone invites me to a group lunch and the time arrives and I can\u2019t make it then I expect them to go eat lunch without me and we\u2019ll reschedule", "Im looking at it as a group lunch but if you look at it that way then sure yeah I get it. He had other options though. He could gone with her and let her order and eat while he waited or he could have offered to bring something back or just anything. I mean i think we all agree he is ta anyway bc he was rude \n\nand I hope his wife never touches his hot dog  again", "Well then again, he invited his employee first and asked her if she wanted to join. So, again his reaction to her was rude, but why should the employee be ditched?", "I\u2019m not really trying to argue this but I guess because if you invite someone to do something and they counteroffer with doing it but at a later time at last minute you aren\u2019t obligated to go later. It\u2019s a choice. If you invited other people then you are choosing to accept the counteroffer and break your invitation to anyone else you invited which is also rude. \n\nI think if you change out \u201cwife\u201d with \u201canother business partner\u201d it clicks more \n\nEdit: I\u2019m realizing no one specified a time"]}
