We got it. \n\nYou could have gone with her to lunch since she didn't have a lot of time and your employee could come later. And your statement to her? That is so much disrespectful. I hope she dumps you.", "ESH. Your hot dog comment was quite rude. After the first delay, she should have realized yours and staff lunch schedule didn't coordinate and did her own thing for lunch.", "NTA. Have people never worked in an office. You go to lunch when all parties are ready. If she had a meeting she could have let him know nicely but she had the attitude first.", "NTA- assuming you was taking your employee out for a company thing! and only extended the invite to your wife.", "YTA yikes do you speak to her like that all the time? She is your partner, not an unruly child you're handling badly.", "If you own the business then why couldn\u2019t your employee stop their work and come back to it after lunch? Do you even like your wife?", "I don\u2019t know if it would work for your wife\u2019s schedule but offering to bring back take out from where you were going since your schedules weren\u2019t lining up would have been kind, considerate and much more diplomatic than whatever have some hot dogs", "Can we please for the love of god stop marrying people we don't give a shit about? You could have at the very least offered to bring her something home instead of getting snarky. YTA I don't know why you're even with her", "Yta why didnt u stay home and make hot dogs ir something", "You're not really rude, but you also could have said \"if you're busy, you and I will go out tomorrow\".", "YTA. You wasted her lunch time and were snide about what she should eat.", "YTA. She can make hot dogs?!?! \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to invite her to lunch, but you did. Then, knowing she also has a schedule to keep, you delay that lunch so that she does not have time to eat before her meeting. Then your blame her. \n\nIt sounds like it\u2019s \u2018just lunch\u2019 but the level of disrespect makes me wonder how often things like this happen.", "Look, I\u2019m going to assume the thing your employee needed to finish was super important and couldn\u2019t be done after lunch.\n\nI still need some INFO: When did you invited your wife to go with you?\n\nLet me explain why I believe knowing that is crucial: if you invited her the night before or that morning, then Y T A without a doubt. You don\u2019t make plans with someone only to disrespect them, their time and their jobs like that.\n\nNow, if it was more casual, something like \u2018hey we\u2019re grabbing lunch when we\u2019re done here, wanna join us?\u2019 then I\u2019d say E S H. If it was a spontaneous invitation and you made it clear from the beginning you\u2019d go once you\u2019re done, then you\u2019re not at fault for telling her maybe she should stay. Either way, you didn\u2019t communicate THAT, you just told her to stay home and eat some hot dogs which I\u2019d be angry about to.\n\nI\u2019m both scenarios you were rude to your wife, so apologise and work on communicating better.", "YTA. \nHow can you just blatantly hurt your wife\u2019s feelings like that?

YTA", "YTA, but for the hot dog line. That was incredibly rude. My husband and I both work from home. We can sometimes have lunch together, but most of the time, our schedules don\u2019t align.

You're getting in the way of people's imagination.", "YTA. You own the business, why couldn\u2019t they pause their work so your wife could come? You owe your wife a very nice one-on-one lunch or dinner. Or both!", "YTA massively", "YTA", "I don't really see what the issue is? OP was planning on taking his employee out for lunch. He then, spur of the moment, invited his wife to come along as well.\n\nHowever, employee was running a bit late, which ended up meaning that if the wife went, she would be late to a meeting she needs to go to.\n\nHer staying home at that point just makes sense, IMO.\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is, can't do anything about it.\n\nNAH I guess.", "YTA. She is also working and she had a timetable because she had meetings coming up. Her time is just as valuable as yours in your employees and honestly it is a bit disgusting that you don\u2019t understand that.

I understand that your employee might have needed some more time to finish their job, but there really was no need to take it out on your wife. Maybe you could have said that she is welcome to join you guys another day if she has to get back to work.\nI\u2019m sure she would have understood.

Stay home and eat hot dogs?", "YTA\n\nI have been in a similar situation and how I broke it to my spouse was by pulling them aside in a neutral room and telling them \"Hey, I'm so sorry, it looks like we actually are going to be running later than expected. I know we agreed on this time, and I know it's really disappointing because I was really looking forward to having you join. Would this time be too late? Do you have to get back to work? I'm sorry this didn't work out for this time, maybe we can make another time for lunch a different day. Want us to make anything before I leave, while my employee is finishing stuff up?\"\n\nIt was conversation with my partner, who I respect.

YTA for making your wife sit around wasting her lunch break thinking she was going with you. YTA for getting annoyed that she was annoyed.\n\nBut you are the biggest AH for speaking to your wife in such a condescending tone like she's beneath you. Maybe learn to be considerate and treat your wife with love next time. And if you gonna invite her to lunch but your work/employee keeps you up then you can get take-out for everyone instead.", "YTA, it was a planned lunch with everyone involved.

Oh no honey, we are running late and I know you have a meeting. Let me make you a sandwich real quick for lunch (or hotdogs). I promise we will have a nice dinner or lunch tomorrow. Sorry about this, thank you for being wonderful about it. Problem solved. \n\nOP YTA! Be a better spouse. On the plus side, im sure if you apologize and just say I should have been better, you will work your way out of the doghouse.", "YTA. She had a meeting so of course she\u2019ll want to know when. Why did you get annoyed?", "YTA. You invited her she took the time out of her work day to get ready to eat lunch with you. Then you and the employee proceeded to drag ass and then you wonder why she\u2019d be upset? She missed her whole lunch waiting on YOU because YOU asked her if she\u2019d like to go with you.

She can't wait around for you when she also has to work.", "Different thought: When she realized the FIRST time that time was cutting close, she could\u2019ve just said that she wasn\u2019t going and asked for something back or ordered her something.

How inconsiderate of you.", "Why hasn\u2019t OP come back and answered the questions about the employee?

What a mean and inconsiderate way to speak to your wife.\n\nGood thing your wife knows how to walk away. I am not that gracious.

Apologize to your wife. Wish you the best", "YTA this is a case of your time is worth more than hers.

She should have just gone out for lunch as soon as you said your employee was running late.", "Go eat hotdogs, asshole", "YTA\n\nWhy couldn't your employee handle it alone or resume after lunch? If you set a lunch time, honor it. It's rude not just to your wife, but also your employees if they have a scheduled break.\n\nShe works, too. Not just you. She also has a schedule to adhere to. Instead of being apologetic that you upset her by not sticking to a schedule, you blamed her for being by your behavior and treated her like a misbehaving child rather than a person with feelings.

The wife was joining them. I\u2019m not sure why she was getting upset when the employee was taking longer. OP could have voiced his response better but generally saying she may have to eat at home is not improper.", "\nYou were taking your employee to lunch and invited her so she could join. Since she was the one who could not bear to wait she should have just said she wouldn't go and eat something else. Instead she decided to make a big deal of it and you ended being rude.

Your wife was invited to tag along if it was gonna fit into your schedules. It ended up not working out- you maybe could have been more polite about it but whatever. Just apologize for the delivery and response", "This is the right answer. YTA for your response. Next time, check her schedule (if you want to invite her) and head to lunch at a time she is available. You have more control over your, and your employees, schedule.

OP isn\u2019t an asshole for inviting his wife to lunch and then working too late for her to join him and his (female) employee.  He is an asshole for deliberately being disrespectful to her and her job.  I think if she primarily does the cooking in their house, she should serve him hotdogs for dinner.  That would also make her an asshole, and it would be exactly what he deserves", "OP isn\u2019t going to answer that question, apparently.

What I'm saying is, she didn't need to even get to the point where we were getting snappy about hot dogs. I would have just abandoned the plan as soon as it might take up to 20 minutes, that's a lot of time if we are just talking about a lunch break.", "How is he deliberately disrespectful? Invited to lunch but then their work took longer than expected and when it didn't suit her work he said maybe you should stay and have some hot dogs or something, since coming would make her late for her meeting. His work ran late, nothing to do with disrespect. \n\n>Does not (at all) mostly side with women-I guess you don\u2019t regularly read this sub\n\nIt's my favourite sub and people here usually overlook women's wrongdoings, especially in relationship questions.

A lot of the time I read these stories and I'm left wondering, okay so how many years of being an asshole came before this post that resulted in the interaction you're now offended by?
