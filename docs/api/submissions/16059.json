I wouldn\u2019t plan future excursions with them.", "NTA \n\nAssuming nothing else planned you stay until the kids are wiped out (had enough) or you get kicked out at closing time.\n\nWhat the other family do is outside of your control.\n\nI\u2019m curious what was the other family\u2019s mums reason for wanting to leave early (I\u2019m guessing mum was bored?)\n\nEdit to add\n\nThe other parents are not doing them any favours by helicopter parenting, with not allowed on this or that ride.  As long as they meet the ride hights let them go on everything, if they puke it\u2019s not the end of the world, thats how they work out their limits", "op=NTA\n\nYou paid a ungodly sum(I'm sure) for those passes/tickets.  If they don't want to go on anymore rides, that's their choice.  Since they have their own car, they can leave, that's their choice.  (tho if you'd shared a Vehicle, I would have suggested that they just find someplace quiet to sit until it's time to go).  \n\nWhat they don't get to do is tell YOU what & when YOUR kids can ride.  Also they cannot tell you when you must leave(Unless you mutually agreed upon these things ahead of time).\n\nI agree-next time do not coordinate trips with them.  They have different ideas of what you can/should do at Park.  \n\nNo water rides????? Really--tho I hope it's warmer there in UK than were I'm at.  (currently 3 celsius-night time) and day time highs have been 10-15 celsius--not sure I'd want to be on a water ride with those temps.", ">I\u2019ve just been called selfish for not thinking about their feelings.\n\nBut you *are* thinking about their feelings.  You're respecting their choice to leave early.  You're not complaining about their leaving, you're not asking them to stay and be uncomfortable to accommodate you or your family.  \n\nThey are free to make their choice, but they have to deal with the outcome and also handle their own children.  They can't expect the world to bend to them just because they want it to.  That's unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If they really don\u2019t want their kids to know others aren\u2019t leaving with them , they can just lie and tell their kids that the others will be on their way back to the car in a couple of minutes. How will the kids know since you alll travelled in separate cars ?", "NTA. Why bother going if the kids can't ride what they want, that's ridiculous!", "Yep, I had very anxious parents and decided early on to just lie to keep them happy and do the things I wanted to do behind their backs. It was that or be that kid who had to sit out everything.", "I have anxiety issues.  I tried so hard not to limit my children because I was uncomfortable.   My husband is not one that panic's easily, so our kids didn't have to miss out.  \n\nNTA.  I would've stuck it out for my kids.  Especially if they were having fun.", "NTA. When they choose to leave is entirely their business. Their children fussing is their problem.", "Another alternative is that the children will be wild, reckless teenagers, trying to cram in all the fun they were missing as soon as they are old enough to get out of sight.  Cops and preachers' kids come to mind.", "NTA. You don't pay Legoland prices to not let your kids go on anything. You don't dictate what others in your group can and cannot do if you are not their responsible adult.\n\n\nAlso, hats off to you. I just took some kids there on a bank holiday weekend and it is simultaneously magical and hell on earth. Hope you got on the submarine ride too - it was awesome!"]}
