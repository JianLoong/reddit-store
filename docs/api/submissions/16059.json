Basically every ride the kids want to go on. \n\nNow the other family wants to leave early, but we don\u2019t.

However, none of us want to leave, as we\u2019d like to go on some of the better rides. Because I\u2019m the one prepared to say no, I\u2019ve just been called selfish for not thinking about their feelings. I am, I\u2019m just more bothered about my family\u2019s than their\u2019s. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, we were in our own cars.\n\nMy son ask his friend\u2019s dad if they could do all a last ride together (Mia\u2019s Riding Adventure) before they left, Dad said yes without consulting Mum, so off we went. All the kids loved it, as did Dad, and we\u2019ve all stayed to the end. Unfortunately, Mia\u2019s broke down, so we couldn\u2019t do it again.

Ideally you would have liked to let your kids do a lot of things that you curtailed for these friends' sake. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because in the process you're teaching your kids that they're not the centre of the universe, and that sometimes we compromise for our friends' sake, which is a lovely lesson.\n\nBUT . . . Now that they are headed home, you feel that there is still time left in the day to do a few things as a family, and that's also very reasonable. What is NOT reasonable, in any way, shape or form, is the other family expecting you to leave the park when you still have things you'd like to do, just because they are. It is, in fact, completely inappropriate for them to assume that they get to lead the decision-making process for any family other than their own, especially after you were so accommodating up until now. At some point, being parents means that they need to learn to roll with the consequences of the decisions that they feel are in their kids' best interests, even if their kids don't like it.", "NTA. Thank them for the nice day and continue on with your fun!", "NTA and these people are weird. You spent a lot of money on tickets, you can certainly stay as long as your family is having fun!
