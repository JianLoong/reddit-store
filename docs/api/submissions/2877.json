It was sort of unanimously decided after day 1 that someone else would be driving the rest of the trip. \n\nI get it, my style isn\u2019t for everyone. I live in a city with great buses and trains so I don\u2019t drive often. Im not as smooth or confident driving long distances as they are. One friend felt more comfortable driving, so I happily handed the keys over and enjoyed my newfound ability to drink instead of sober drive. She doesn\u2019t like me or trust me any less, she just felt better with me not driving.

You are asking that your girlfriend both feel unsafe driving with you, and pay for the privilege of doing so. If it's so important to you that you drive, you pay for it.

Even then, they need to be in a car with dual controls and accompanied by a qualified driving instructor. \n\nThere are different rules and restrictions on the motorway to the rest of the road network, and it's a very different environment.

Maybe something deeper is going on?

I'm always extremely happy when I'm proved wrong!)", "\"She knows it's ok\" \"she knows she can trust me\"\n\nShe doesn't does she? Otherwise she would be in the car with you.\n\nThere could also be another source: maybe she has a preference for trains for other reasons? Maybe she just made an idea and doesn't like changing her plans? I don't know but I don't think ot makes her an asshole...", "Ehh that just doesn't make any sense. I live in the US and thus have to drive everywhere, and since you said she's not worried you'll get tired (according to another comment) that just leaves distance/unfamiliarity with the area. That really shouldn't be an issue if you have directions. So she sounds a bit unreasonable...sorry.\n\nIf she is really adamant about taking the train you can ask if she would pay for part of your ticket that you can't cover. Otherwise there's not much else you can do IMO", "Thanks I appreciacte it. Yeah when I passed my test, the first thing I did was arrange motorway lessons since wanted to be comfortable with motorways before I started driving regularly.", "Yeah she knows what I was like in my driving lessons and knows that I'm cautious. I passed my test with less minors than she did and have been comfortable driving to my parents house and have been on motorways without issue since I have passed.

You're the asshole", "NTA", "Nah\nYes you need to improve your confidence in driving but city driving is very different if you haven\u2019t done it before. It is very stressful for everyone in the car. Especially if you\u2019ve never been before. I would recommend using park and ride to avoid the city centre traffic.\n3.5 hour driving is different from a 2 hour lesson. \n\nHave a sit down with your gf and have a serious conversation as to why she doesn\u2019t feel safe - is it your driving in general or just because of the length of trip? Remain calm and explain if it is your driving that you just want to improve and be a safe driver to everyone on the road.", "It depends how she said it. \n\nI think it is not a great option.  Depends whether you have time to stop for breaks. When you've just learnt to drive you concentrate a lot more intensely and it's tiring. Also I recommend driving in daylight to begin with which might be tricky with it being winter.\nYour girlfriend being nervous might affect your driving.  \n\nCan you go somewhere nearer and explore the new city when you can get a cheap train ticket?

You might be having an argument about nothing", "NAH in my opinion. If she doesn\u2019t feel safe driving a long distance with you, you\u2019ve got to respect that. And if her plans are out of your budget and you can\u2019t go, she\u2019s got to respect that. Neither of you are assholes for being disappointed, but neither of you should be mad at the other either.", "NTA, you gave a solution to the problem, which she didn't accept, so you felt the only options left was to cancel. NTA at all. \n\nMy only solution would be to suggest a coach. They're cheaper than trains, and you won't be driving so she doesn't have to worry. However, they are slow, and you have less space than an airplane seat.", "She needs to grow up. NTA", "NAH. might get downvoted, but your feelings (about how good of a driver you are) do not negate the reality (new young male drivers are the highest risk of write off in the UK, people die on the roads too often, you\u2019re in charge of a heavy powerful vehicle and just because you can do it doesn\u2019t mean you can do it well.) you absolutely don\u2019t have to drive, but I\u2019m shocked at how you\u2019re so easy to pin this on your other half. Once more, driving isn\u2019t a necessity or right, it\u2019s inherently dangerous and people are allowed to be scared of that.", "It\u2019s a much bigger deal in the UK, 4 hours would be considered a long trip and our roads and motorways are always packed, usually with people who drive like absolute dicks. \n\nI\u2019d look at getting a coach. Coaches are usually loads cheaper than train.", "She isn\u2019t wrong for her feelings if she doesn\u2019t feel safe but she\u2019s wrong for accusing him of cancelling the trip just to spite her.", "But it's motorway driving from what you've said - you wouldn't have motorway experience from.your driving lessons and so it's fairly reasonable to not be sure of your ability in this situation.", "What red flags are there?", "I never said I don't want to pay for the train I said I cant afford it.

That's not the same as a road trip.", "Get over it lmao people get killed on the road and you\u2019re so far a fairly untested and new driver", "I\u2019m not sure if the car rental industry is as big of a disaster in the UK as it is here in the US, and since you\u2019re a new driver I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t rented a car before either, so I would ask around or call the rental place and make sure that if you arrange to rent that specific car that you are actually garunteed to get that car. I rented a car a year ago for a friends wedding and on the website I booked like a small/medium sedan and when I got to the rental counter they were like \u201cit\u2019ll be the same price but we only have SUVs left\u201d and gave me a massive Ford Explorer. Fortunately I could drive it just fine, but if it\u2019s very important to you to have certain size or type of car I would make sure you\u2019re actually going to get it before you make a final decision. It would suck to realize you were getting something super unfamiliar the day you\u2019re supposed to leave.", "I have had motorway experience since passing my test as I have been driving my brothers car when it is available", "It may not be about you. I'm not sure I would want a long road trip with any new driver in winter. Yes motorways are supposed to be safer but they are also full of AHs", "Plan a route where you can stop at a decent service station halfway there. I'd recommend that after 2 hours on a UK motorway anyway, esp as a newer driver. 2 hours, grab a coffee, maybe some food, stretch your legs, giggle at the little group of shops that have gone on holiday together, then the rest of the journey.", "Which motorway will you need to take? Some are utter bellends to drive but if you\u2019ve had specific motorway lessons that\u2019s definitely a bonus. It\u2019s a shame she feels that way about being in a car with you, hopefully once you\u2019ve driven a journey like that she\u2019ll change her mind. Are there any updates, does she still think you cancelled just to be a dick?", "Sounds like you\u2019ve planned it out, make sure you plan a stop on the way, I\u2019d recommend about the 2 hour mark (I\u2019ve been driving 11 years and can comfortably drive 3 hours without stopping but it took some time to build up to that). But definitely have a sit down and see if she has any other concerns, maybe suggest taking her out places for day trips if you can. building up the driving time. Not sure where you are in the uk but I\u2019m Yorkshire and there\u2019s plenty to do for cheap enough within 2 hours drive", "You can catch connecting coaches though, same as if it wasn't a direct train.", "Referring to her anxiety around driving and therefore it\u2019s a spiteful and malicious action (which is how you\u2019ve framed your girlfriend.)", "By the time we make the trip I'll have passed over a year ago. I emailed local places and they said it would not be a problem", "He\u2019s financially unable to go, how is that spiteful?", "No my driving ability. I have driven since my test so it's hardly like I drove for the test then never again", "The only way to become tested is to drive. Yes people die on the roads does that mean I should never drive? People get killed doing literally anything does that mean I should not travel anywhere?", "In that case, I apologise and take back my earlier comment - I can see why her saying she doesn't trust you feels like a personal criticism.", "How is it a spiteful and malicious action to not want to spend over budget for a trip? She might have anxiety around me driving and that's fine but that should not mean I need to spend money I don't have on train tickets", "If she wants to go on the train so damn bad then she should pay the full cost herself for both of you since it\u2019s more than driving.", "if the conflict was primarily financial i don\u2019t think half the post would be about his hurt feelings. \nif i was planning a trip with my partner and something turned out to be a little more expensive than i thought, i\u2019d suggest we postpone the trip to save, not declare that i\u2019m not going. he doesn\u2019t say \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t go\u201d.", "No but it means that everyone is able to judge risks and rewards themselves. Just because YOU are okay with xyz doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else has to be. Sorry, but you might be a bad driver. That\u2019s it. Bottom line.", "Nobody said that buddy. Never did I or anyone else demand you go over budget. You know how you repair this, come out of this whole situation mature? HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOUR OWN GIRLFRIEND.", "That's what op is doing tho. \n\nHe can't afford the train so he offered an alternative to his gf. His gf rejected so he's left with no choice but to cancel. But his gf is pissed. OP isn't the AH for cancelling. Gf isn't the AH for not wanting to ride his car, but she's an AH for getting angry that OP cancelled.", "If I can't afford the train on the day's we'd planned to go then yeah the trip won't go ahead. It doesn't mean it won't happen again in the future but we won't be above to do it for the days we'd planned. It's not spiteful to not go over budget for a trip when I can't afford to", "I honestly don\u2019t think he meant \u201cI won\u2019t be going\u201d in a petulant way, it seems like it\u2019s just a case of semantics.", "You literally called it a spiteful and malicious action in your previous comment so yeah you did say it. I spoke to my girlfriend and she accused me of cancelling the trip to spite her when I had already told her I can't afford the train tickets", "Ignore them, they\u2019re trying to find a problem that isn\u2019t there.", "No, how you\u2019re framing her anxiety is malicious. I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re misunderstanding or misreading absolutely everything", "I misread one comment that's hardly everything. I haven't framed her anxiety as malicious at all. What is malicious is accusing me of cancelling the trip out of spite when she knows it was because I cannot afford the train tickets.", "Ok. Stop taking it so personally she doesn\u2019t like you\u2019re driving. She\u2019s gonna stop accusing you of cancelling out of spite (because you two can then have a conversation about her anxiety and your newness driving) and then\u2026 you won\u2019t go on the trip at all. Cancel it.", "She knew before we had even spoke about me driving that I couldn't afford the tickets though. We looked at the price I said I could afford that, came up with the idea of me driving us, she said no so I just pointed out that we'd either have to cancel or go somewhere else/go another time and she accused me of cancelling because she doesn't trust me to drive there", "NAH. I have been in a car with someone who drove like it was a racing game- slamming the accelerator and break. I had to explain I need them to slow down and drive more carefully. Even when you are 100% in the correct, others make mistakes and you have a much better chance of averting disaster if you\u2019re anticipating sudden lane changes and keeping a good following distance. Lives are on the line everytime you drive. Safety is a mindset; you need confidence to drive but also humility. I can make a 2 hour highway drive but I wouldn\u2019t want to go on a road trip longer than 4 hours overall b/c being on the road is very risky.", "I read most of your comments, and will go with NTA. She refused for you to drive, and also refused to drive, which is ridiculous. \n\n(And also, driving anxiety will not be an excuse to me. I drove with my husband 2 hours from Montreal to the USA border less than 3 months after getting my licence in blinding snow, and he has extreme passenger anxiety since being in a traumatic car accident 5 years prior to that)\n\nYou could suggest that she spend some time in a car with you prior to that event, which is quite a bit away, or pay for your train ticket if she isn't happy about it. There is not much else that can be done, unless she decides to try driving again.", "NTA...  tell her if she can afford the train ticket, you will meet her there with the car.", "I don\u2019t understand her logic. If you drive then it\u2019s affordable, if you don\u2019t then it\u2019s not. She didn\u2019t want you driving so that means you\u2019re back to unaffordable. Unaffordable means canceled. I\u2019m not saying she has to get in the car w/someone she feels isn\u2019t ready for that amount of driving. I\u2019m just confused as to why the lack of funds is confusing to her. That\u2019s just basic math", "ITT: Americans in general going crazy. Texans saying, \"Wait, that's just a trip the closest 7/11 for a 96 oz Slurpee\".", "NAH The people calling her TA are all attacking her reasonings. It really doesn't matter. The reasons someone is not feeling safe are irrelevant. she doesn't feel safe. she doesn't want to be in a long trip with a new driver. Agree with her or not, that's her right. \n\nI'm almost leaning towards Y T A for your immature reaction. Instead of reacting calmly you attempted to invalidate her emotions and then unilaterally canceled the trip as retribution. But I'll stick with NAH because it seems you both have issues with communication.", "Why doesn\u2019t she drive?  Why doesn\u2019t she come up with extra money?", "NTA\n\nTell her to think about it this way: it's not one long distance but a bunch of short distances.", "NTA what does she want you to do wop out a magic carpet? You pass a driving test so you can drive. (Having passed both UK and US driving tests, if you can pass the UK one you're fine especially as you have said you've had additional motorway lessons) Why don't you rent a car and she can meet you there and pay for her own train ticket. This whole thing is a bit ridiculous, she wont even let you drive her to build trust. Does she get Ubers etc and let strangers drive her?", "Nope, NTA. Go do something you\u2019d like to do.  Maybe even rent a car and for a LONG drive.", "YTA You passed your test a year ago and haven't driven daily since then, only occasionally. I'm not surprised she feels you do not have enough experience for a two way, three and a half hour motorway drive. Some motorways are awful like parts of the M6. Trust is the wrong word and I agree with her about your experience level. If you were both originally looking at a train journey for your trip, switched it to driving down, then decided to cancel, i'm really not surprised she thinks you cancelled out of spite. Because the original plan was to go by train. That could still stand, it was you that switched it to the alternative of driving, then cancelling. You altered all the plans so I'm not surprised she is upset with you. You both have rail cards, use them.", "Are you factoring in fuel prices and parking? Also this is in months from now, is it possible for you to budget for the train tickets? It seems odd to me that the train is so expensive, a two or three day rental seems like it would cost just as much or more than a train ticket. You also have to factor in insurance probably.", "YTA - you want to drive so go for a drive.  Do it alone with your money", "I'm from the UK, where from and to are you driving coz some motorway is awful and might add more context.", "I didn't unilaterally cancel the trip. We looked at train prices first, I said I could not afford them. Then I suggested the idea of me driving and she said she doesn't trust me so since they were our only options I said we wouldn't be able to go. That's not me cancelling, it's me not buying train tickets I cannot afford", "She passed her test last year and hasn't driven since and said she isn't comfortable driving that far which is fair enough since she hasn't been driving. She said she can only afford her tickets if we went by train", "If you read the post fully, I said we looked at train ticket prices, I said I couldn't afford them. Then I suggested me driving since it was going to be a lot cheaper, she said she didn't trust me to drive us so I said we're back at square 1 since I can't afford the train tickets and she accused me of cancelling out of spite", "Yeah so with petrol it is still half the price and the hotel we're looking at has free parking for guests so we wouldn't need to pay for parking", "Have you had a look some a railcard? I know you can get one on trainline for about \u00a330 that cuts off 33% of your ticket when you order on their app or website.", "Info: has she tried to come up with any solutions/suggestions? You told her you couldn't afford to take the train, which is understandable. You said you could drive and rent a car which is about a third of the price of train tickets. She said no to the car/you driving, but hasn't given any other options?", "Can\u2019t you get a coach? When I was younger I used to get coaches all over the UK because they\u2019re so much cheaper than train. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t blame your girlfriend for not wanting to do such a long journey when you\u2019re a relatively new driver in an unfamiliar car. I wouldn\u2019t take it that personally - people drive like absolute bellends on the motorway and I personally hate the experience even with people who have driven for decades. It\u2019s not going to be a fun journey if she is anxious about the drive.", "Saying \"The only way we can afford to go on this trip is if I drive us, we either need to drive there in a car or we cannot go at all\" is a compromise. Other options are not affordable.", "Yeah we've both got railcards", "No she hasn't given anything. She just pretty much accused me of cancelling the trip out of spite", "We checked coach prices and we'd have to get 2-3 coaches each way which would make it nearly as expensive as the train", "Then no, I am sorry but she is being a major AH and manipulative. I can understand having anxiety about a new driver, I am still anxious sometimes when I drive and I have had my license for 10+years, but if I have an issue I will try to come up with solutions. The fact that she won't and doesn't seem to care that you CANT take the train and is calling you spiteful would be a deal breaker for me", "Where the hell are you travelling to? Sounds like the back end of beyond. Most cities are easily accessible by coach. \n\nIs a part train / part coach not an option? \n\nHonestly it sounds like you should just reschedule to when you\u2019ll have more cash saved up and make sure you look to book the train tickets at the right point in advance to get the best prices.", "It's because we don't live in a city so we have really poor transport links", "She has put you in a tough spot!\n\nMaybe let her know that you don\u2019t want to cancel and are looking forward to this trip with her but as the train fare is over your budget, what does she recommend?"]}
