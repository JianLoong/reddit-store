I can understand her hesitation if she\u2019s never been in a car with you before - even if you are an excellent driver.", "N A H you are a licensed a driver and it's fair that and isn't comfortable having a new driver drive her on a three hour drive to an unfamiliar area.\n\nNTA because it's not fair for her to say that you being unable to afford tickets is purposeful. Though I'm surprised renting a car is cheaper than the train.", "NTA.\n\nIt was NAH right up until she started throwing personal attacks in response to 'I can't afford that.'", "NTA but I'd rethink the whole gf. You can't afford the train tickets and that's that. She's being a spoiled brat", "This sounds so weird to me as an American. We don't even blink an eye at the thought of driving 3.5 hours for a weekend getaway.\n\nI think you're stuck: if you can't afford the train, and she won't allow hiring a car, I guess you're both staying home.

I wouldn\u2019t trust someone who just got their license this year to drive long distance either. There\u2019s a reason insurance premiums are more expensive for younger drivers, regardless of how careful they are. Your gf isn\u2019t wrong for not being comfortable with a relatively new driver, and you shouldn\u2019t push her. Safety comes first.

I\u2019m also from the UK so fully understand not buying train tickets, the prices are eye watering and it\u2019s frankly disgusting that hiring a car is cheaper. Anyway\u2026 Does the drive involve any motorways? Have you driven on a motorway before? I\u2019m trying to think of a reason why your gf would say such a thing. Is she contributing financially to travel costs or is it all up to you? If she\u2019s paying for herself and doesn\u2019t want you to drive her then she\u2019s more than welcome to buy a train ticket and meet you there! \ud83d\ude09 Somehow I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be best pleased with that suggestion. To say that you cancelled the trip just to hurt her is unhinged and not going with her at all actually sounds like the better option. Absolutely NTA.", "I'm going with YTA.  I think it's important to put the proper context in here.\n\nYou only recently passed your driving test.  You don't have your own car.  She's never driven with you.  Frankly, you don't have that much driving experience.  Period.  \n\nI would not feel comfortable doing a 3.5 hour drive with you either.  To put it another way - I would not feel comfortable *myself* doing a 3.5 hour drive.\n\nYes, you need experience to get comfortable with longer drives.  But you barely have any experience with even shorter drives.", "That would be a decent ides but then I would be paying the complete costs of hiring the car whereas if my girlfriend was travelling with me then it would be 50/50", "Yeah it's a fair distance but I still don't see her issue with it. We'll be at 70mph for most of the trip and its mainly motorways anyway which wouldn't be too bad.", "Sounds like a catch-22 OP can\u2019t afford a train and she won\u2019t let them drive, how does she expect them to get there?", "I asked her this and she said she doesn't think I'll get tired she just doesn't trust me to drive that far", "Oh no I am only paying for my tickets but it is 3x more expensive on the train than it is to hire the car for the weekend", "She became the asshole when she accused him of canceling the trip to hurt her. She's trying to manipulate him into doing what she wants.", "Oh I get that I just don't see why she wouldn't feel safe with me. And the reverse is also true in that she can't force/expect me to pay for train tickets I can't afford when I've found a cheaper solution that is in our budget", "She is able to drive but cannot afford a car. She passed last year and said she wouldn't feel comfortable driving since she hasn't drove in a year.", "Oh I already said I'd make sure to take a break instead of driving for the full length and she just said that wouldn't change anything.", "It's hard not to take it personally when she doesn't trust my ability. The car I would be renting is the same as my brothers car that I have been driving so I am used to it", "Yeah I tried to think of a better title but wanted one fairly short so people would read it haha. \n\nShe hasn't been in the car with me but she knows I'm responsible and cautious. I've even took motorway lessons because I want to be cautious. I only drive my brothers car when he comes to visit as he doesn't live too close so it wouldn't really be possible to borrow it", "I have a railcard but the price was still much more than the cost of renting the car. There is only one route we can take and it already has multiple change points in the  train journey", "Why do you think that? I'm not disagreeing with you I'm just curious of your reasoning", "We've got one trip already booked but we've paid for train tickets already for it. There isn't going to be much of a chance from now until the trip. I'll be driving near christmas but she'll be going to see her family so won't be coming with me", "What red flags?", "Thanks! Yeah it will involve motorways but I had a few motorway lessons after my test ansd have driven on motorways after then. \n\nFor the train we would be getting out own tickets and for the car we would be splitting it 50/50 so if she got the train and I drove, it wouldn't be a saving since I'd have to pay for 100% of the car costs.", "I regularly had 2 hour lessons then had 12 hours of motorway lessons after I had passed and have been driving across multiple towns to see my parents so there isn't much more experience to get from shorter drives. Yes I don't have my own car but I have regularly drove my brothers car and the car I would be renting is the same model", "Yeah, but YOU'RE the one that wants to drive. You can't refuse to compromise but be mad she won't.", "You sound like a fairly typical inexperienced young male driver, ie, the type most likely to get into an accident because they over-estimate their own abilities. I'd be reluctant to go on a 3.5-hour motorway journey with you.", "NTA, but It sounds like she may be getting driving anxiety. I used to be so scared of driving and afraid of OTHER people on the road, not necessarily my driving. I didn't really get over it until I just got used to driving over time.\n\nHas your GF ever been in the car with you during your driving practices? Maybe if she sees your driving skills, the better she would feel about your driving the 3.5 hours.", "You really can\u2019t take anyone\u2019s anxiety personally.   I\u2019ve been driving for over 20 years. I went on a road trip recently with friends, with a car I rented and paid for. It was sort of unanimously decided after day 1 that someone else would be driving the rest of the trip. \n\nI get it, my style isn\u2019t for everyone. I live in a city with great buses and trains so I don\u2019t drive often. Im not as smooth or confident driving long distances as they are. One friend felt more comfortable driving, so I happily handed the keys over and enjoyed my newfound ability to drink instead of sober drive. She doesn\u2019t like me or trust me any less, she just felt better with me not driving. I have my own anxiety, so I know it\u2019s not about *me* it\u2019s about *her* and it\u2019s ok to back a back seat, literally sometimes, when some one doesn\u2019t feel comfortable", "Ahh. The solution I was going to suggest was to split the driving between you. If she hasn\u2019t driven in a long time she could do the first part of the trip when you\u2019re closer to surroundings you know well.", "You still are a relatively new driver, and you have never driven with your GF.", "Yeah but I want to drive because paying for the train is more that we've budgeted for so me paying the whole cost of hiring the car means it wouldn't really be any cheaper so then it would be out of budget", "I don't over-estimate my own abilities at all. I was cautious during every driving lesson and my test and have remained like that every time I have drove since. How am I supposed to get the experience if I don't have the chance to drive", "if someone isn't able to handle three and a half hours at highway speeds they probably shouldn't have a license at all. that's extremely basic stuff, it's not driving at breakneck pace over hard-packed snow to get the children's medicine to the remote village\n\nwith love,\n\nan experienced old male driver", "No she hasn't been in a car with me yet since she hasn't really had the opportunity", "She straight up refused to drive at all which is fair enough for me since I am comfortable driving but she just says she doesn't trust me", "Yeah but just because I'm relatively new doesn't mean I can't make the 3.5 hour drive. When I've drive to my parents I've invited my gf along but she hasn't taken me up on it so she has had the chance to be in the car with me.", "Yes, it would. You are asking that your girlfriend both feel unsafe driving with you, and pay for the privilege of doing so. If it's so important to you that you drive, you pay for it. It's not a partnership if you expect her to concede to you 100%. If you want something that obeys, get a dog. If you cant afford either the train or the car, you can't really afford to go, so stay home.", "How much experience of motorway driving do you have? Have you had any motorway lessons?", "In the UK, learner drivers have only been allowed on the motorway for a few years. Even then, they need to be in a car with dual controls and accompanied by a qualified driving instructor. \n\nThere are different rules and restrictions on the motorway to the rest of the road network, and it's a very different environment. Making the jump from occasionally doing 70mph on a dual carriageway to doing it on a five-lane motorway with articulated lorries breathing down your back window can be daunting.\n\nwith love,\n\nan Institute of Advanced Motorists observer/assessor.", "How do you expect her to trust your driving if she was never in the car with you?\n\nShe now needs to commit for a fairly long ride with someone she never drove with before...\n\nI do get the anxiety that brings along: maybe do a smaller, local, trip first?", "Talk to her, and try to figure out what's going on. Maybe something deeper is going on? If my guess is the reason, invite her out for a drive next time! \n\nI don't know if this can be solved by the time of your trip but this issue will probably come up again, so better to figure it out now than later. I would feel pretty bad if my SO didn't have faith in me though :(", "It is not important that I drive at all. Like I have said in the post I offered to drive because it would be cheaper. If we got the train we would be paying for our own tickets and that would still be out of budget. I suggested me driving as a cheaper alternative since I could not afford the train tickets along with the resto f the expense for the trip. She said no and when I said I could not get the train she accused me of cancelling the trip out of spite.", "After I passed my test I paid for 12 hours of motorway lessons to get me comfortable with them and I've driven on motorways with my brother when I drive to my parents house.", "Oh yeah but she knows I'm cautious and knows I know what I'm doing. She's been in card with friends and ex boyfriends for trips away with no hesitation.", "Yeah I tried talking and she said she just doesn't trust me since I haven't drove that far before. I passed my test with less minors than she did and she knows I'm a cautious driver. I mentioned to her that I've drive to my parents house and it's not like I've only drove in our town and she just said it's not the same.", "In that case, I apologise for under-estimating you! Yes, I would be comfortable making that journey with you. (I genuinely apologise. I've encountered so many young male drivers who think that passing their test means they have nothing left to learn, that I tend to make a very broad assumption. I'm always extremely happy when I'm proved wrong!)", "\"She knows it's ok\" \"she knows she can trust me\"\n\nShe doesn't does she? Otherwise she would be in the car with you.\n\nThere could also be another source: maybe she has a preference for trains for other reasons? Maybe she just made an idea and doesn't like changing her plans? I don't know but I don't think ot makes her an asshole...", "Ehh that just doesn't make any sense. I live in the US and thus have to drive everywhere, and since you said she's not worried you'll get tired (according to another comment) that just leaves distance/unfamiliarity with the area. That really shouldn't be an issue if you have directions. So she sounds a bit unreasonable...sorry.\n\nIf she is really adamant about taking the train you can ask if she would pay for part of your ticket that you can't cover. Otherwise there's not much else you can do IMO", "Thanks I appreciacte it. Yeah when I passed my test, the first thing I did was arrange motorway lessons since wanted to be comfortable with motorways before I started driving regularly.", "Yeah she knows what I was like in my driving lessons and knows that I'm cautious. I passed my test with less minors than she did and have been comfortable driving to my parents house and have been on motorways without issue since I have passed. She's never going to see what I'm like in the car if she won't actually let me drive us somewhere\n\nIt's nothing to do with trains since we normally just choose the cheapest option to travel when we're going away.", "Yeah exactly, I don't see the problem with driving longer than I have drove previously. I have to do it at some point so I dont see what the problem is with it"]}
