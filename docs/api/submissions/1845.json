When we got together he wanted to buy a house but couldn\u2019t afford it because he had little saved and lots of student loans so he couldn\u2019t qualify for what was needed to get a mortgage to afford anything in our area. He asked me on date 2 what my salary was and I was a little suspicious but answered truthfully. \n\nNow we have been talking about moving in and he brought up that since I qualify for more loans I could get a mortgage for us. To be clear I own about house but it\u2019s in the city I use to live before the pandemic. I moved back to be closer to family and I don\u2019t own anything in my current city. I told him I\u2019m not buying anything and he said we can\u2019t find anything at his price point so if I buy sometime we can get something cheaper. But then I\u2019d be taking on all the risk so he has a cheaper place to live\n\nWhile this is probably true if I got an apartment, I feel like he\u2019s using his knowledge of my finances to take advantage of me. I told him I will buy if he can afford to pay half the down payment and be on the mortgage but he said he couldn\u2019t qualify and even less now that interest rates have risen. I told him that\u2019s not my problem and if he couldn\u2019t quality we have to find a place to rent. But even cheap places is $2200 and I wanted to split 50/50 but he said since I make more I should pay for more. I told him I\u2019m not paying any more than him and even though up him trying to get me to buy a place for his benefit and said he was gold digging but he just laughed and said gold digging if for hot girls.
