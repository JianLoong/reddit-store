She filed for divorce because she wasn't happy anymore with me and we have now been divorced for almost 2 years. It was very difficult for me especially not being able to see my daughters all the time, but we were able to arrange a 50/50 split custody agreement and I also pay court ordered child support since I earn significantly more than her.\n\nBut looking back, I realize that divorce was the right decision and the divorce has motivated me to pursue my career more and focus on my physical health. It has definitely paid off. I am in the most comfortable position financially that I have ever been and have been in the best shape of my life, so I guess in a way the divorce was a start for me to reach my full potential. My ex wife and I have a good co-parenting relationship, but nothing more. I have been doing great so the last thing I want is to have my ex entangled in my life more than she already is. I only communicate with her about the kids and shut down any attempt of her trying to involve herself in my life that doesn't involve our kids.\n\nMy ex recently called me and told me that she hasn't been doing great financially and that she has completely burned through her savings to pay rent and bills on her own to the point where she had to sell her car a few months ago. She said that she has been using public transportation to get to work and pick the kids up from school which she says completely stresses her out because it's an almost 1 hour bus ride to her work making her late a lot and having no time to properly do anything besides work and picking up and taking care of the kids when she has the kids.\n\nI currently own 2 cars. One that I use on a daily basis to go to work and run errands. I bought a more expensive car about a year ago and I pretty much only use it when I am going out on weekends or go on dates.\n\nKnowing that I have 2 cars, my ex asked me if she could use one of my cars to help her out so that she can have a life besides work and kids. I told her that her being able to have a life besides the kids has nothing to do with me and is not my responsibility. I told her that the kids are my only responsibility towards her and that anything else in her life is her problem since I'm not her husband anymore. She told me that I'm insensitive and that being terrible isn't going to lead to anything. I just told her that the financial security that I provide isn't something she has the right to anymore and that she has to deal with her own problems now.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Everything our kids need is within walking distance of my ex's place.

Expecting financial support over time beyond court mandated child support and alimony is untenable.\n\nShe had a car post-divorce. She had to sell it. The correct remedy for her would be to go to the courts to revisit child support or alimony. If the courts disagree with her, you aren't required to furnish her with another car she may sell again in the future. \n\nThe implication that someone is an asshole for not keeping their ex in possession of a car dies pretty quickly when you play out the range of divorce types and contexts. Does a woman whose husband cheated and left her owe him a car 3 years later? Surely not. And if a car were owed, it would be granted during the divorce.\n\nIf she isn't financially able to support the kids, yall need to revisit your custody arrangements until she gets back on her feet. Arguments on here about \"think of the children\" should be falling into the custody arrangement that she clearly cannot provide for (either by support being too low or by her situation being too unstable to keep the kids half time). \n\nSolutions should be \n1) she goes to court to revisit support (alimony and child support) in her favor or, failing that...\n2) You both agree to change custody for you to take the kids more and use your financial stability to take on more time and responsibility to provide for *the kids.*\n\nBut NTA for not handing over a car.

No? \n\nShe's an adult. Her inconvenience is not at all your problem. You don't have to be her crutch, you don't owe her anything.

I think it is amazing that your life has improved however your children will see their mother struggling while daddy has 2 cars. Children dont understand having to go back to court for more child support or spousal support. They dont understand that mommy is no longer YOUR financial concern. They do understand that you two no longer live together and that their lives have completely changed (and have now changed even more with mom not having a car) bc of it, and they do see that when they are home with mom there is no car and you have two cars and may wonder why that is and not one person is considering the effect this has on them. OP you are thinking about how your ex is not your responsibility and she PERSONALLY as  an individual stand alone human is not but if it affects your children it is your responsibility just as much as it hers if you were ever in that situation and she could financially afford to help you. I don't understand why we treat ppl like this all bc it didn't work out. Are you punishing her bc she was unhappy with you? Is she asking you for help bc she thinks you owe her? Is this why you have the conflict in your head if you think you are the AH or not? How can you not have empathy for your children? To say either of you are doing your children any good bc you share them 50/50, and now your half is done when they go to mom or dad  is sad on both ends. Please, please go the extra mile for your children. If it's not a car, at least find a way to help the situation with bringing or picking the kids up from school or activities. It's no wonder any type of relationship in general can't work if we only think we stop supporting each other when you feel your 50% of the relationship is taken care of. Could that be a reason neither of you were happy in your marriage? Did one person feel they were giving more bc the other stopped at 50%? We are all so afraid to give and help others in fear of looking like a sucker or being used or knowing you won't receive it back, and that kind of thinking is what makes you a sucker. We don't always get the opportunity to do good things in life bc we let them fly by us due to emotions, but you have an opportunity to be a hero to your kids. They will remember this no matter the decision you make and I can guarantee you that.", "YTA", "Also, the liability you could face if she caused an accident could be crippling, OP.", "That's correct but in the meantime as adults they need to compromise somewhere i think.", "> The correct remedy for her would be to go to the courts to revisit child support or alimony.\n\nor just looking for a better job, tbh. spot on for the rest of the comment.", "I understand what you're saying, but imo you're employing a very utilitarian view of the kids.

She already had a car and sold it, so giving her another one isn't changing the situation that led to her selling her previous one.\n\nI also wonder if part of the reason for her not being happy anymore was due to OP trying to live within a budget, but she didn't want to", "Sure, an *amazing* life lesson on how to be an absolute **doormat**.

She also said she doesn't have time to do anything outside of work & the kids and that's why she wants the car so that's where everybody got the idea that she wants it for fun time. But if this is all true then why wouldn't she say something before she had to sell her car? She clearly thought that was the right move to make rather than to talk to OP and say hey can you give me an extra $100 a month to help pay my bills so I don't have to sell my car? Or get a second job. I know so many people that do stuff like DoorDash, or answer call center calls at home, or any of the other at home job opportunities that are part-time! I used to transcribe speeches while my kids were doing their homework for extra money. \n\nThe point is she made the decision on her own to get rid of her car. The fact that she can't afford to get another car tells me that she probably can't afford the expenses on OP's car. It's not about being sympathetic. It's about choosing to not be financially irresponsible. Also, doesn't the fact that he's refusing to help her tell you that there might be more than we know? She could easily get a part-time job as she only has the kids half the time. \n\nAlso most people with expensive sports cars that they only take out once in a while, don't want to put daily mileage on them.

Like using the other's car. You can't have your cake and eat it too. She wanted to be free. Well now she is free, free from the inconveniences/annoyances/unpleasantness of the relationship and from the benefits of the relationship too. \n\nNTA OP is not a charity organisation. OP's responsibilities are to take care of /parent his kids, fund his kids and to take care of himself. Funding his ex's comfort is not. Lot of people use public transport (even for an hour or longer) to go to work and back, they survive it, she will too. Plus her reasoning that with using public transport she doesn't have time to do anything apart from work and child care is bs. She has 50/50 custody, she has half of the year every year for herself to do what she wants for the same amount of time she spends with the kids when they are with her.

Let the adults handle these problems, and not the kids. They don't need to know if dad is helping mom (or not helping her).\n\nIf it's not in the best interest of the children to be in their current environment, why enable it? Maybe mom needs to make hard decisions. Maybe a court order needs to amend child support? Who knows.\n\nWouldn't showing the kids what proper boundaries look like be a better lesson for them to learn? They don't need to be involved in this decision, but teaching them that \"no means 'no'\", and helping them identify, and handle, manipulative tactics will go a long way.\n\nMy experience is eerily similar to OP's, both in ages, and experience. It differs in that there's only one kid, I have sole custody, and a few other areas. But I've been in this situation before, and I did the same thing OP did. Who fixes the car when she doesn't do an oil change because she didn't have money for it? What about repairs? You think she's going to be on the hook for that?

Which means you'll have to pay more to include her or you'll pay out of your own pocket if something happens... also maintenance will still be on you.\n\nShe needs a longtime plan, not an \"easy\" short time solution.

I think a lot of people are glossing over a key issue. While OP does have two cars, one isn\u2019t for regular use. He drives it sparingly most likely to keep the mileage low and potentially help the car maintain the value. It might also be a car that burns gas quicker and with gas prices going up in a lot of places he may not want to pay that bill. Taking one of his cars is a big ask of your EX. It\u2019s not like she asked to use it for just one day; she seems to be asking to borrow it until she gets back on her feet and who knows when that will be? Is she gonna pay the insurance on the car since shes driving it or pay the difference should his rates go up to add a driver? Is she going to reimburse him when she\u2019s comfortable for the increase in mileage and decrease in value of his expensive part time car? Will she reimburse him for the extra gas cost if there is one using the car full time? She\u2019s asking him to be without one of his vehicles and to potentially incur a lot of costs to help her out. Trust me I understand the difference between public transportation and having a car so I am sympathetic to her plight. I\u2019ve been where she is and I know how much it sucks. Having an hour or two commute for what would take no more than a half an hour with a car sucks. But it is not his responsibility to fix this issue for her at his own personal cost. \n\nTo everyone saying her earning potential dropped being a stay at home mom, that was most likely addressed when he was required to give her child support while having 50/50 custody. A lot of times 50/50 means no support. The key purpose of support is to make up for expenses you don\u2019t experience because you have your child less than the other parent. A secondary purpose is to keep the children in question in the lifestyle they are accustomed to or close to it which applies to this situation. The big question here is did she adjust her lifestyle based on her new earning potential? Did she downgrade her car from what she had? Did she buy a house she can\u2019t afford to keep them in the same type of housing as at his place? Or did she keep the house even though with her salary she can\u2019t afford it? She may need to adjust her lifestyle and budget to match her income + the child support, whatever that figure may be. \n\nI think OP is well within his rights and moral obligations to say no in this instance. When you leave a partner you don\u2019t get to come back and ask for overly large favors such as providing a vehicle whether they can afford it or not. And you definitely shouldn\u2019t expect large favors at a great personal cost from anyone, let alone an ex. And I\u2019m not saying she made her bed she needs to lie in it.

Even adding her to your insurance can increase the cost and puts you out of pocket again.  If she's having this much financial problems than what's to say that she will be able to pay to actually take care of the vehicle, as well.  There's a lot that goes into a vehicle and it's unfair for her to assume just because you have a spare car she's entitled to it.  Is it a nice thing to do?  Sure.  Is it smart?  Not really.

Help her with leads for a new job, be it better pay or shorter commute, and perhaps be willing to loan her the car for the day of the interview should she get one?

There are a lot of things that factor into a divorce. It's really weird that you expect that someone who's had their heart ripped out, torn into little pieces, stomped on, and set on fire, to treat the person who did that just the same as a couple that amicably divorced after growing distant over the years would. I am civil to the mom of my kiddo, but she literally did things to me that had a judge order that she never be allowed to know where I lived. A PERMANENT order protecting my address.

OP seems to be healing from that and working on himself, but he doesn't owe the person who harmed him a dang thing.

I have made that round trip in the morning and again in the afternoon, since kinder, he's now finishing his 9th and final year at that school before he enters high school. So pardon me if I'm not exactly finding OP's wife's 1 hour commute on those 50% of the days she has her kids to be such a tragedy. I was doing the same amount of driving on 70% of my son's trips to school. It's called being an adult.
