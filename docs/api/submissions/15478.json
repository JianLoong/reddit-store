She said that she has been using public transportation to get to work and pick the kids up from school which she says completely stresses her out because it's an almost 1 hour bus ride to her work making her late a lot and having no time to properly do anything besides work and picking up and taking care of the kids when she has the kids.\n\nI currently own 2 cars.

The correct remedy for her would be to go to the courts to revisit child support or alimony. If the courts disagree with her, you aren't required to furnish her with another car she may sell again in the future. \n\nThe implication that someone is an asshole for not keeping their ex in possession of a car dies pretty quickly when you play out the range of divorce types and contexts. Does a woman whose husband cheated and left her owe him a car 3 years later? Surely not. And if a car were owed, it would be granted during the divorce.\n\nIf she isn't financially able to support the kids, yall need to revisit your custody arrangements until she gets back on her feet.

Your situation is as it is because you didn't use one earlier.\n\nDivorce breaks the in good and bad vows, even if you have kids. An ex husband or ex wife is not an asshole for not financially supporting their ex beyond court mandated child support, even if they share a kid. Sure it's nice to do if you maintain a friendly divorce and remain friends, but it's not expected and, frankly, wildly entitled to expect your ex spouse to just give you a car after the divorce is finalized. Whatever support was agreed during the divorce is the split. \n\nEspecially in the situation like the OP where she did the leaving, the idea that the ex is perpetually socially bound to support their spouses' finances is untenable.", "You need a new lawyer.

Will she take it as a green-light to make more demands?)

A $500 emergency could end up costing thousands if you don't have the savings to cover it, since these things tend to snowball.\n\nAlso, child support often is a fraction of what it actually cost to raise a child.
