Ugh, boyfriend.  Nta.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s not doing 50% of the chores. Domestic labor is labor. If he\u2019s doing 30% of the domestic labor and OP is doing 70% then OP is subsidizing his lifestyle.\n\nThe only reason he doesn\u2019t want to make the change is because boyfriend doesn\u2019t view domestic labor as his responsibility the same way he views the fiscal obligations. \n\nTell him he needs to find his own way to handle his 50% of the domestic responsibilities and stop doing any for him.", "ESH - Your bf is being selfish and putting first what works for him, rather than thinking about you or both of you as a couple. \n\nThat said, the reason it isn't \"NTA\" is because you've made this about how much he earns when it isn't, it's about him not pulling his weight around the house. \n\nYou need him to do more around the house, him working less and you paying more would be a good way to go about it, but ultimately if he likes his job, even if it requires more hours, then that's up to him and he can find another way to make sure he's doing an equal share. \n\nI suggest given he's refused your suggestion, make what you need to happen known and then let him come up with a suitable solution.", "NTA.  You pointed out that his decisions are impacting you and suggested a solution (that you pay more) so he can hold up his end of the household responsibilities.  If he wants to pay 50% of the rent, fine, but he needs to perform 50% of the other responsibilities as well.", "NTA-- How are you shaming him by...??\n\nMaybe he's right. Perhaps you should stop shaming. him. You should also stop doing more than half the chores. Just tell him when it's his turn to buy the groceries, cook, and clean and stop doing his half. Perhaps he will decide it isn't working anymore.", "NTA - He needs to do his share of the chores. How he manages to do that is up to him. Honestly, your offer was MORE than fair. I'm guessing he just doesn't want to do housework and is using his busy schedule as an excuse.", "NTA, your asking for him to help contribute and dial back the hours. It\u2019s a fair compromise", "NTA! This isn't working for you and you offerd a fair solution. You don't expect him to change his job, you want him to work less, pay less and contribute more to the household, fair deal to me.", "NTA. While he is loving his job, you are working yourself to death. Of course he says things are working the way things are - you are doing all the work! Your BF needs to understand that, when you are in a relationship, you need to sacrifice to make things work. And, right now, you are the only person making any sacrifices. \n\nHere is a thought - he should be doing his share of the chores. Since he isn\u2019t willing to cut back on his work or exercise time, suggest that he learn to sleep less so he can fulfill his obligations in the relationship!", "NAH\n\nYou want to pay more and have less chores. Lucky for you, you are living in 2022. Take the money you would use to pay more than 50% and outsource the chores. Hire a weekly cleaner and have Instacart bring your groceries.", "NTA If the bills are split 50/50 then the chores need to be too. He is getting you to give your free time in a way that is impacting your mental and physical health because he doesn't want to pull his weight. Get Tody or another cleaning app and divide up the chores. He should not be this comfortable being this unfair and cruel to you and should care that his actions are harming you so either he can see exactly how much of a free ride you've been giving him or you can see that he doesn't care about your time, effort and physical/mental well-being.", "NTA-  but if you have extra money to pay more than half, hire someone to come in and clean for you.  I don\u2019t know where you live but you can order groceries and have them delivered.  There can be some type,of compromise here.  Be happy that he wants to pay 50%.  There so many people on this site that have a man they taken care of because they don\u2019t want to work.", "You don't have the time, either. Your studies count towards your busy-ness. Set firm boundaries that you alternate grocery shopping. How he accomplishes that is his business.", "NTA, it's not about loving his job, that's totally fine, but he's finding a way to push extra work on you, and he isn't understanding your struggles. He needs to pick up the slack, because it sounds like you're doing most of the work around there", "As others have said, ignore the part about the job. \n\nDon't be responsible for determining how he spends his time. But stop doing his chores yesterday.\n\nJust stop. The sooner you stop, the better the chance you have of a long term healthy happy relationships. \n\nIt might feel that's it's \"easier\" for you to do the chores. That's an absolute lie. It's easier in the moment than convincing a reluctant partner/housemate/child to see that there is a job to do and then to do it. But over time you will see all the chores, you will plan all the chores, you will try to get help with the chores and you either end up as a maid or hugely resentful.\n\n\nIt's early in the relationship. This is where you make sure you both set the tone and habit for the rest of your time together.\n\nHe does half. You do half. Don't compromise and you'll be so so so much happier in 2 years \n\nSo to start, ask what nights he wants to make dinner. Then on those nights let him make dinner (spoiler alert: he might take a while to realise he'll need to plan to grocery shop as well). Decide who cleans the kitchen when the other cooks. \n\nSpend 15 minutes everyday with both of you cleaning the house together. Use a timer. With two people this is actually surprisingly effective. You can pick any chores. Scrub a toilet, Start the laundry, vacuum, wipe counters, tidy living room, make bed whatever \n\nThis is super useful for two things. One is that you both clean for a very manageable period of time. The other is that it trains you both to look for little chores and gets him in the habit of actually seeing the chores.", "NTA but this is a problem that\u2019s going to grow exponentially as you get older. \n\nI can\u2019t emphasize this enough, this phase in your relationship is the easy part. As you get older your responsibilities grow and things like health issues, work pressures and especially child care will test the very best of relationships. \n\n*Your boyfriend is setting a hard boundary that household chores are your responsibility.*\n\nHe\u2019s unwilling to devote any mental energy to chores because he has outsourced it to you. Imagine how awesome it would be if someone cleaned up after you and cooked for you everyday\u2014why would you want to give that up? This would be fine if you both wanted a traditional marriage where the man is breadwinner and the wife stays home \u2014 but in this case your boyfriend doesn\u2019t even make more money! He wants you to be a housewife AND the breadwinner. I know you believe you love him and all this stuff doesn\u2019t matter but I guarantee you\u2019re going to resent the shit out of him if you stay together long enough. And if you have a kid together there\u2019s a really good chance you end up hating him. Save yourself the trouble and move on. \n\nIn the future, if you\u2019re going to date a man who refuses to do chores, at least make sure he can afford a housekeeper.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not asking him to quit his job. You\u2019re asking him to dial back his hours because y\u2019all don\u2019t need the extra money, and it\u2019s causing your relationship and shared responsibilities to get neglected. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t understand peoples\u2019 obsession with working to the point that they neglect their family/SO/home life to be able to show off some dumb ass street-cred. Being Mr. \u201cI Bust My Ass\u201d at the expense of your relationships when you don\u2019t even need the money is pretty dumb.", "NTA...it sounds like you're offering a very generous compromise that allows him to keep the job he loves.  Keep talking and keep expressing your needs here. He'll likely come around.", "NAH.\n\nYou guys both work super hard but he chose to go for a low-paying job which he loves which he is entitled to, and on top of that he still insists he wants to pay 50% of the bill which is an honourable wish. However I get that it's not fun to be doing all the chores , and I hope you reach a compromise. Surely once he graduates he will get a better-paid job and you guys can find a balance?  \n\n\nIf that's your biggest problem, I think you guys are likely fine.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like you insisted he quit his job, so he's probably just feeling the lousy end of the gender norms insisting he should be able to provide financially while you should be ok with doing more shopping and housework.  If you communicate well, hopefully you can get him past that and make him understand it's worth it to you financially to have more of his time and less housework.", "NTA - you're not shaming him for anything, he's playing the victim card. You just want him to take his fair share. Tell him there is two solution, or you share chores as a team ( and still I bet you'll need to make the grocery list ) or you live as roomates and each of you take care of his own groceries and cooking. He managed to survive before meeting you so he must have done his groceries and cooking at one point...", "NTA- So let me get this right you are bugged by the fact he wants to make sure he can pull his weight in his own mind? Look go find a guy who has no problems letting you pay his bills and then see how some of a issue this is..Just tell him you guys need to make more of a effort to hang out and he needs to pull his weight around the house hold as well..", "YTA. He wants to pull his own weight, and has found a job he loves. These are both things to be commended. \n\nRelationships are hard and require sacrifice. Soon enough he will be done with school and the situation will change, so why not let him enjoy the job he loves, and keep in mind that this is a transitory period in your relationship.", "NAH, but this one was tough. I was leaning towards YTA until I came to the part where you offered to pitch in more for the bills so he can spend more time doing chores. You didn't force him to quit his job, you offered an alternative and compromise. That's very good.\n\nYour bf is also trying his best, but maybe his male pride is a bit in the way of accepting your offer? \n\nAnother talk might be best. Try making him understand that you are overwhelmed and your suggestion is not meant to make things easier for him or belittle him, but to make sure he has the time he needs to take care of his gf and support her. Maybe work in that this would only be temporary as he'll likely earn more after his degree.\n\nI wish you the best!", "ESH here because it\u2019s not an issue of him having a low paying job, the issue is he isn\u2019t pulling his fair share of duties around the household chores. Can you sit down as a team to brainstorm ways for you each to contribute to household tasks without either of you becoming overwhelmed. Maybe a grocery delivery or meal subscription service, heat and eat style meals, laundry service, housekeeper etc. would all be things worth discussing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The issue isn't his job specifically, it's that he's fine neglecting doing his fair share of domestic work to keep your home life happy and comfortable. He's fine treating you like a servant who is in charge of grocery, cleaning, and cooking.

This has nothing to do with how much money he makes. This has to do with how you divide the household chores, which should be 50-50. I wonder how much time you each spend exercising & how much time it takes to do the household chores. Going to school full time & working 20 hours a week is something many people can handle & still find time to cook & clean. You can shop online & have things delivered, which saves some time, & you might be able to build exercise into your day by biking or walking places.", "Not at all. I'd say he's hiding shit from you.", "Yeah, I mean OP even said they would pay more. They're giving him options. It's ridiculous and quite heartless to take the one that makes OP suffer.", "Right! I was like dude that is the most self centered answer I ever heard. She would not be saying something unless it wasn\u2019t for her.

I'll try to bring the topic in sensitively, thanks for pointing it out!", "While your suggestions would have merit for a couple settled in their careers etc., I am doubtful college students can swing these luxury items (especially when OP mentioned that the boyfriend is already working extra hours just to be able to contribute his half of the basics).

Throughout the course of a relationship, there are going to be times when one person picks up the slack, and times that the other person does. Things are very rarely fair and equal at all times in a relationship. She states that he is almost done his Bachelors, so this is most likely a very temporary situation. It sounds like they have a good relationship besides this hiccup, to me, this would not be the hill to die on. \n\nThat is all contingent on the fact that once he is done his Bachelors he goes back to doing his fair share of the cooking/cleaning", "I was just throwing some ideas out of things they could discuss and pull their own ideas from that what work for their household budget. It might be location specific but right now I order a grocery service that sends me a box every week and the cost is very comparable to what I would spend at the grocery store. Maybe they have to sacrifice a day a month or so where instead of exercising together they do one large grocery trip and prepare crock pot dump meals they can freeze and utilize for the next month. Just some ideas, my real point was that they need to sit down together and have a discussion on how they can make their household work given their current circumstances.", "It makes it worse tbh. It shows he lacks empathy and an understanding of basic adult skills like cooking/cleaning.", ">That means I currently do 100% of the grocery shopping and most off the cleaning and cooking\n\nThen stop doing his share. Only shop for things you need for your meals that you cook only for yourself. Don't enable his behavior by just giving in and doing his share.

He's working more hours to stay 50/50. I agree she shouldn't have to do 100% of the chores.

Her boyfriend has to work more hours just to stay 50/50 with rent. So she should pay for the a maid to cover the boyfriends lack of help?", "Well think of it this way. She offered to pay extra money towards bills, what if she just out that extra money towards things that would help them save more time? Such as grocery delivery or a maid or something? Then it would be more equal while not ignoring the time constraints", "That\u2019s a fair point. If she willing to pay more in rent then she could use those funds elsewhere. \n\nBut I do feel that part of the issue is also quality time with one another. If he\u2019s going to school and working so much, she might just want him to be around more.", "Makes it worse.  If he wasn't living with you he'd have to do the chores. There's a strong trend of men dismissing household work, and it's bogus.", "Is there a difference in standards playing in here? My version of clean and my husbands version of clean\u2026\u2026are two very different beasts. His minimum may not be much work where yours is\u2026\u2026.so maybe that is feeding into his lack of understanding on the impact it has on you? Just a thought."]}
