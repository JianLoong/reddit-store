Me and my family like to travel a lot, and because of that we go out of state a lot during the holidays. we recently went on a trip for 3 weeks and just got back last week. when i sat down to play in my ps4, i noticed that there was about 10+ new games installed, and i got even more upset when i noticed that a game i specifically asked him and others not to play or start, was recently played. i instantly assumed it was my uncle because he\u2019s the only one that actually plays the ps4 aside from me. i was extremely pissed that he used it without my permission so i decided to delete all of the games. at that point, i didn\u2019t care how much progress he has made  or how much money he has spent on them. in my opinion he should be focusing on getting a job and making money instead of playing on someone else\u2019s ps4, but i still feel a bit guilty after doing so. AITA? \nP.S: i made it clear to him to ask for my permission to play the ps4, and also made it clear that if he wanted to download and play games he had to make a new account .\n\nEDIT: thank you for everyone giving your opinions. let me clear a few things up: 1: please do not assume that we are rich, i have not specified where we were for 3 weeks. 2: as a 14 year old i do have a part time job at a local store myself, and i know what it feels like being rejected from a job. 3: my uncles stays at home all day and has made 0 attempts in getting a job. he has been living with us for four months and has not applied to a single job. even when he was getting job offers he declined them. 4:i am not entitled, most of the things i own are bought with my own money that i earned and saved up.\nthank you for reading.", "created_utc": 1673631317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b0cp8/aita_for_deleting_my_uncles_games_on_my_ps4/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do deserve respect, since it is your PS4, he's a guest in your family home, and you asked politely.", "NTA since you explicitly set out your boundaries and he chose to ignore them. He could have gone about this the way you asked him to... maybe he fails to respect you because he's much older? Anyway, there's no excuse for what he did after you made yourself clear.", "NTA, he could have opened a new account.

Specific boundaries were set and he refused to follow them. He\u2019s nearly forty and a kid asking to please not touch a specific game on top of the ten he bought seems like an immature thing to do. It\u2019s a simple instruction and I question how a nearly 40yo man cannot handle following that.\n\nA kid thinking a grown man should get a job instead of buying and paying for *ten* games is not an unreasonable thought for a kid. She\u2019s a kid and she knows jobs are part of being an adult so him seeing the guy focus on games and overtaking a console he has no claim to will warrant *some* judgement. The kid has no idea how hard the job market is and how stressful it is out there. All she knows is there\u2019s an adult not respecting her boundaries and personal device when he should be out doing *something else*.\n\nIf someone went into my iPad or my computer and ordered a bunch of apps without my permission, I\u2019d get pissed too. It doesn\u2019t matter who paid for it.

And there's no rule that says \"if you don't have a job, you're not allowed to have fun again until you find one.\" \n\nIt's totally reasonable to draw boundaries when it comes to your stuff, but I'm getting AH vibes from your judging how he spends his time. Especially since as a 14 year old, you really have *no* idea what he's dealing with or what it's like. \n\nI know teenagers hate hearing that kind of thing, but I'm sorry, you just don't. He's probably dealing with a fuckton of stress AND a lot of shame, and it's totally reasonable he'd want to blow off some steam with games.

It\u2019s temporary, but he\u2019s taking advantage of it. I think it\u2019s time to have a serious talk with your parents about what he is doing so they can deal with him.

Him the least, yeah he should've asked and yes, if he was going to do this he should've created his own profile too.  However, a little bit of compassion goes a long way when someone is on hard times and you are showing none.  Ideal solution here would've been to give him a profile and shift the games/saves over to it.  Games do take up space, save files, not really.)\n\nWell you're an AH for that woefully ignorant statement.  How dare someone who is out of work do anything at all enjoyable that isn't looking for jobs 24/7.\n\nINFO:  And this detail does matter.  Did he have his own profile on the PS4 that he was loading games to or was he using yours?  That's particularly important on the game you asked him or others not to start.\n\nMore INFO:  Wait... you asked him not to start a specific game, yet have a problem with him using your PS4?

The reason?\n\nOP doesn't seem to have a smidgen of empathy for her uncle. OP and her family are well off enough to constantly travel, even going off for holiday trips as long as 3 weeks (!!), in the midst of a massive economic crisis of skyrocketing inflation. Her uncle is unemployed and basically homeless, probably miserable seeing his rich family members living their best lives, and decides to play his niece's PS4 without her permission. It's less than ideal, but under the circumstances I'm not going to call him an AH.\n\nOP, pick your battles. Try to have some compassion for your uncle before getting pissed off.

Kids deserve the same respect as adults (I'm in my 30s, ice had teen family members live with me and I respected their things)", "NTA  He sounds like a freeloader and I wonder how much longer your parents will put up with that.  You had one rule: ask permission to use the PS4.  He didn\u2019t so you have every right to reclaim control of your own possessions.", "NTA\n\nYour save data is never safe on someone elses console, he should know that.", "INFO: are you sure these games were purchased through your account? Because my PS4 shows new games as installed on all profiles, not just the profile that actually purchased the game.", "NTA he should ask you before using it", "NTA.  It's your PS4, not uncle's.  You set up rules for him to follow if he wanted to use your PS4; he did not follow them.  He has lost the privilege of using your PS4.\n\nHOWEVER, your opinions about how he's spending his time are not relevant (and keep them to yourself).  You say both that he hasn't applied to a single job \\*and\\* that he's declined job offers--they can't both be true, kiddo.  You also likely don't know what he's doing every moment of every day.  He may pursuing job leads of which you're unaware.  It's also possible that he's depression-bumming off the grace of your parents, but even if that's true, don't comment on it.  That's between him and them.  If you call him out for it, if you talk about him like this to your parents, etc. then you become a jerk for that.\n\nWhat \\*is\\* your business is your stuff, and you are within your rights to decline to allow him to use it.  (If your parents made an issue of this with you, then you have to deal with the \"my house, my rules, all your stuff is because of me\" argument, but you seem to suggest that they're on your side with this one, which makes it a lot easier).", "Yeah, well I'm 54, and I say the kid that actually lives in the house, works and had his space violated gets to have an opinion on if his almost 40 year old uncle is being a bum or not.", "So uh, your comment came a bit premature as OP edited her post. She is not rich, she has a part time job at a Grocery store, and buys most things that she does for herself. I don't think calling her names was right just because she said no to someone playing at least on her account or asking for permission.", "i have my PayPal account linked to my ps4, therefore if i want to buy any games it charges my account instantly. but when i was out no charges have been made on my account, when i deleted the games, i saw that a few were 30-60 dollars each. he is unemployed and have made no efforts into getting a job, so i do not know where he got the money for the games. another thing, only my account is on the ps4, meaning he has been playing on my account specifically", "Good for you! One of the things you probably learned in your 54 years is that different people have different opinions and that's okay.\n\n(That said, I made my comment before OP added all their edits. If OP really is working and the uncle really has made zero effort to get a job, then I agree with you, but that information was not in the post I was responding to).", "I\u2019m about 2 decades younger and I agree.

Got a job and been there for 8 years. \n\n4 months of not applying is ridiculous.", "They go into email inboxes, it's not a physical pile but it's the same impact. I spent some time digging into the data the last time I was job hunting; there are definitely better and worse times to apply, and over a holiday would be a particularly bad time. Ideally, you want to be at the top of the inbox around when the person who might review your application is starting their day if I recall correctly.", "Yeah but you should change what you said because it's objectively wrong. Choosing to be wrong isn't a virtue lol", "Then the 40 year old should buy his own damn playstation", "Wrong. So wrong. It\u2019s her ps4, she gets to set the rules about its use. Uncle did NOT respect her rules about HER PROPERTY, probably thought HE was entitled to do as he pleased because he\u2019s older. Nope. Ever since me and brothers hit the age of 10 our parents allowed us to set boundaries about our rooms/personal items. Everyone who visited our house had to respect those rules. We got to set the terms of use of our personal property and that was that. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s had a job or not, doesn\u2019t matter if it was a gift from parents, it is HER PERSONAL PROPERTY. She has every right to do as she pleases with her property.

My family is not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination. My husband and I are both disabled and get SSI checks that barely cover the bills, and yet we have saved $100 over the course of several months to pay for gas to visit family, unless the family member paid for our gas. We\u2019ve stayed for several weeks at a time before as well. We even take frequent vacations to visit my in laws and we stay at their home and are gone for at least a week. \n\nThe nicest things we own were gifts from family and friends for birthdays, Christmas, Anniversaries, and other special occasions. That doesn\u2019t make us rich nor does it make our family and friends rich. Some of the items were hand me downs or bought from stores that resell items cheap, such as pawn shops. We save as much as we can to get them gifts as well, but the best things they all tell us that they love getting from us is some of our home made craft gifts so we save for those supplies so they each get something unique.\n\nMy point is, you are making assumptions as to how OP\u2019s family is able to go on vacations, how much you think they are spending, and how they were able to afford a PS4. I\u2019m giving you another perspective to consider.\n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA and if anyone, especially an adult, had ever overstepped my kids\u2019 boundaries on their own belongings, I\u2019d have already kicked them out of my house.

And doesn't he know that, unless you went to the trouble of deleting the save data as well, that he can just reinstall those games used on his account?

No where do I see an indication that she's rich-- they could have been visiting family in another town for all we know.

Because they might be putting their heads in the dirt about this and trying not to notice that he's not making any effort to ever move out, or it's something they're already fighting about and knowing that it's also bothering you, their child, could be the motivation to getting him out. Fingers crossed it's the latter.", "Lemme tell you a trick. Take the power cord and hide it when you're not around.\n\nNow he's legit gotta ask permission. NTA", "Paragraphs and capitalization are not optional.", "I mean it's not about the games, it's about the fact that he is asserting a sense of ownership over your device, waited until you were gone, and bought the games. I think how you handled that was appropriate and that's not the subject matter you should talk about with your parents. You should talk about the fact that your uncle is starting to claim ownership of your items and isn't listening to you about your basic boundaries. And he's spending money on a lot of video games, and spending time on them, at your direct expense"]}
