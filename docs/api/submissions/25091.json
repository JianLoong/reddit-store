{"id": 25091, "submission_id": "15wah0c", "title": "AITAH for calling my SIL out?", "selftext": " I need to crowdsource a large group of people who don't know me:\n\nSo some context: my(f36) SIL(f34) has been riding the train to crazy town her whole life. It's important to note in the 11 years I've been with her brother, we've had a rocky relationship. Her and I don't get along the best and never really have. Anyway, she's wreckless with money, enjoys being with several male suitors, selfish .. you see where I'm going with this. SIL was evicted from her 4 bedroom townhouse and is staying with other family in a 2 bedroom appt..... SIL has 3 kids and she likes to pawn her kids off on whoever she can so she can do whatever as often as possible(part of why she doesn't like me is bc I don't bow down to her aggressive personality). My oldest child (f19) was asked by SIL to babysit said 3 kids from 6-9pm last Saturday night. She agreed as they are her cousins and she has watched them before. So, 830 rolls around(kids are getting tired) and my oldest starts checking in with SIL to see when she's coming back. Her response was 'why you keep asking? I told you I was coming' immediately I knew what that meant and told my oldest she was set up and SIL would not be home until late. 9 pm rolls around. Nothing. 10 pm comes. Nothing. 1030 I told her to text SIL and say she's dropping the kids off at home. Nothing. 11 rolls around. Nothing. So I decided to text her and here is what I said(copied and pasted, names taken out):\n\nABCD I think it's pretty shitty you lied to HIJK about the time frame of keeping the kids bc you want to be out here in streets. Either come get your kids or I'm dropping them off at home. I'm tired of the way you always use HIJK bc you know she won't say no to you and you are done taking advantage of her. It's not the kids fault they have to be shuffled around bc you can't be a fu**ing mom. Grow up.\n\nIn turn she was forced to leave the party she was at. I will admit, I felt a sense of victory. And now she is working hard to pin whoever she can against me (granted. This doesn't bother me. #1 everyone knows what kind of person she is and #2 outside of my partner and my gaggle of kids, I really don't care what people think of me). My MIL has been riding me for a week now to apologize bc it's creating more tension in her home (where SIL is staying) and I said absolutely not, SIL can f**k right off.  I've been the bigger person several times in the past with but this time I don't want to..I feel like I said what everyone else is always thinking and doesn't want to say because they're scared of her. \n\n\nAMITAH or is she?

Not sandwiching your criticism in compliments?", "NTA - I think the only way you WBTA is if you let your daughter persist and not intervene. While your daughter is still of age to do what she likes, its not fair to her or your SIL kids to be taken advantage like that be a grown adult who made their own choices in life.

My oldest is very soft spoken and has a hard time standing up for herself. So she has a hard time saying no to her aunt. I had to convince her to even text SIL to begin. My daughter missed her plans with her boyfriend (bc the kids were not picked up)and was not going to say anything to her aunt. So I encouraged (aka borderline forced) her to text SIL.\n\n\nEta: trying", "You have no idea how spot on this is. Part of me is feeling guilty because I know my MIL likes to keep the peace and I've seen how it makes my MIL feel when my SIL will keep the kids away from her when she's mad at her. So Ive always been the bigger person to help keep the peace.", "I mean, you make a fair point lol. I guess for upsetting SIL in general. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I'm not and my MIL knows I stand firm on not apologizing. MIL also knows I am right.", "Yeah, also NTA - No To Appeasing your SIL. Enabling her has gotten everyone to where they are now, and you should absolutely not continue doing it. \n\nWorry about, Protect, & Keep YOUR peace FIRST.", "Ok NTA. An apology won\u2019t even fix it- SIL is probably actually fuming that she got held accountable and the only \u2018apology\u2019 would be you OKing her behavior.. which is fundamentally not possible. Maybe just tell SIL, MIL and daughter that any future babysitting will end at prearranged time with drop off (&have SIL give gas money with the car seats at drop off)", "It's not your job or responsibility to suck up to or fiddle your SIL! You've done nothing you need to apologize for!\n\nMe? I'd have called CPS. That's something to apologize for because it would be over-reacting and horrid for those kids.", "NTA.\n\nYou could have gone for an official call for child abandonment but you didn\u2019t.

Always a classic come back \ud83d\ude02", "Lol appreciate your feedback and could see your point. While I don't think it's myself, MIL, or daughter, when SIL creates situations and involves other people, it becomes chaotic..

Oh well. My daughter, and even myself or other teenage daughter, have no problem watching the kids at any given time. It's the taking advantage of and lying I don't like and why I intervened. I told my daughter for right now, she needs to say to babysitting and set some boundaries.", "NTA. And it sounds like SIL is how she is in part because MIL enables her BS. Calling out awfulness in people we love isn\u2019t awful. It\u2019s tough love.", "Nta and the situation sucks! Hopefully you can limit contact between SIL and your kids (though idk if it will be possible), and if not set clear boundaries so that SIL doesn\u2019t take advantage of your children.", "NTA", "NTA. Do. Not. Apologize. You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA.", "Don't apologize. You are a mother dragon. Be the mother dragon. NTA", "I did not add in the story MIL was not home during this time.

Your SIL used your daughter again. She needs to go to therapy and to get her shit together for her kids\u2019 sake.
