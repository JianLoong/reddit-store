So like, your sister needs to stop being so wasteful at minimum, but realistically also needs to drop the sociopathic crap.\n\nBut your parents really suck. Set yourself up to be able to put up some healthy boundaries with them. If they're fine with torpedoing your childhood, they'll do the same for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd awesome job with the diet, but keep in mind the best diets are those you don't need to put any effort into maintaining. The goal is long term, so it's best to be realistic about addictions and tolerance for discomfort.", "The way I see it, your sister wants you to remain bigger so she can be the \"pretty healthy one\" at your expense.  When she offers you food you shouldn't have, ask her, \"Are you sure you won't eat the rest of it?\"  Then ask her if she's sure.  Ask if she's certain you can have all of it.  Then, ask for a final confirmation that she won't eat it.  If she confirms all of the above, take the food. Enthuiastically, thank her for it.  Then, while smiling at her and without breaking eye contact, walk to the trash bin and drop it in.  \n\nDon't think of the ice cream or cake (or whatever it is) as a treat from a loving family member, it's a tool she uses to \"keep you in your place.\"  If she gets mad about it, then ask her why she bought so much if she wasn't going to eat it?  Her actual answer doesn't matter, as your reply will be, \"next time don't buy so much.  From now on, I will not be the garbage bin.\"  \n\nTake your power back from your family.  You're nobody's garbage bin.", "NTA. This is just awful that the people who are supposed to love you the most are not supporting you. Upfront communication is best. My husband and I go back and forth when he buys unhealthy stuff and I'm like \"stop tempting me!\" And then he stops for a while, but sometimes forgets. It sounds like there's just no effort on your sister's part and very little from your family to support you. If you can, find people who will support you and live with them, your health is important and your feelings are valid.", "NTA. It sure sounds like your sister is trying to sabotage you. And, I don't like the way she and your parents talk to you. I'm so sorry about the way you've been/are treated by them. I think you're going to have to come up with some coping mechanisms around the junk food being brought into the house. It could be you throw out the food. Or, as a friend would do, maybe salt the cake/ice cream if you feel like you're losing control and eating too much of it. It also might be helpful to go to OA meetings or join a group focused on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. I just think you need some support since you don't have it at home. Friends? Other family members? Wishing you the best.", "Granted it sounds like she is sabotaging you, whether through jealousy or something else. But you need to practice self control. Identify that she is trying to make you fail and fight against it. Don't let her ruin your efforts and win. Every time she offers you food you just take it and throw it in the trash. Maybe she'll stop after you've \"wasted\" enough. Fuck the sabotage.", "NTA. Yikes. Your family has a very toxic environment in terms of food/weight. Props for you trying to break out of that and be healthy. You asked your sister not to offer you crappy foods, and she ignored that. That's not cool and shows a lack of respect. With that said, you are responsible for your own actions so while it's shitty she keeps offering you junk, you are the only person in control of consuming it. So long as you live with your toxic family, those temptations will likely be around so working on your self discipline skills will be the best way to counter this issue if you are unable to move out.", "NTA. You obviously have been trying to make a change in your diet and health. It\u2019s difficult and you will have days that you slip. It\u2019s one thing to ban your sister or family from buying junk food that they eat, it\u2019s completely different when your sister buys it with the intention of guilting you or tempting you into eating it. I\u2019m sorry that your sister is sabotaging you.", "NTA, I understand how difficult binge eating disorders can be and I understand how difficult fighting that temptation can be.
