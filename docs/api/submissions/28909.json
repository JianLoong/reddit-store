The goal is long term, so it's best to be realistic about addictions and tolerance for discomfort.", "The way I see it, your sister wants you to remain bigger so she can be the \"pretty healthy one\" at your expense.  When she offers you food you shouldn't have, ask her, \"Are you sure you won't eat the rest of it?\"  Then ask her if she's sure.  Ask if she's certain you can have all of it.  Then, ask for a final confirmation that she won't eat it.  If she confirms all of the above, take the food. Enthuiastically, thank her for it.  Then, while smiling at her and without breaking eye contact, walk to the trash bin and drop it in.  \n\nDon't think of the ice cream or cake (or whatever it is) as a treat from a loving family member, it's a tool she uses to \"keep you in your place.\"  If she gets mad about it, then ask her why she bought so much if she wasn't going to eat it?

It sounds like there's just no effort on your sister's part and very little from your family to support you. If you can, find people who will support you and live with them, your health is important and your feelings are valid.", "NTA. It sure sounds like your sister is trying to sabotage you. And, I don't like the way she and your parents talk to you. I'm so sorry about the way you've been/are treated by them. I think you're going to have to come up with some coping mechanisms around the junk food being brought into the house. It could be you throw out the food. Or, as a friend would do, maybe salt the cake/ice cream if you feel like you're losing control and eating too much of it. It also might be helpful to go to OA meetings or join a group focused on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. I just think you need some support since you don't have it at home. Friends? Other family members? Wishing you the best.", "Granted it sounds like she is sabotaging you, whether through jealousy or something else. But you need to practice self control. Identify that she is trying to make you fail and fight against it. Don't let her ruin your efforts and win. Every time she offers you food you just take it and throw it in the trash. Maybe she'll stop after you've \"wasted\" enough. Fuck the sabotage.", "NTA. Yikes. Your family has a very toxic environment in terms of food/weight. Props for you trying to break out of that and be healthy. You asked your sister not to offer you crappy foods, and she ignored that. That's not cool and shows a lack of respect. With that said, you are responsible for your own actions so while it's shitty she keeps offering you junk, you are the only person in control of consuming it. So long as you live with your toxic family, those temptations will likely be around so working on your self discipline skills will be the best way to counter this issue if you are unable to move out.", "NTA. You obviously have been trying to make a change in your diet and health. It\u2019s difficult and you will have days that you slip. It\u2019s one thing to ban your sister or family from buying junk food that they eat, it\u2019s completely different when your sister buys it with the intention of guilting you or tempting you into eating it. I\u2019m sorry that your sister is sabotaging you.", "NTA, I understand how difficult binge eating disorders can be and I understand how difficult fighting that temptation can be.

I\u2019m older and healed now so I mostly pity her and out of pity I take a bite just so she feels comfortable enough to eat but when I actually really don\u2019t want to eat or sip her food she freaks out and throws it away because she\u2019s so scared of ever being bigger than me and losing that dynamic that benefited her throughout our childhoods.\n\nAs for why my parents did this? Now she\u2019s nearing 60 my mother has finally been diagnosed with several severe issues (narcissistic, bipolar though some doctors argue BPD). She had a dream when I was a child that I would develop and eating disorder and get into drugs (spoiler, that was my sister). So the whole time she was trying to make me overweight on purpose.

Self-hate can only lead to unhealthy behaviour.\n\nIf your sister buys a treat you want, give yourself a small serve every day.

Because if she realizes that you've found a workaround to what she's doing she might try to interfere.", "Gonna disagree, the food is bought in a proportion to encourage OPs eating disorders, binge eating. Don't eat anything your sister buys and move out. NTA but omg your family is *not* normal. Can you privately speak with your GP about your parents and sister encouraging you to develop an ED?", "It worked for me but ymmv:  add more healthful choices to your diet in addition to removing things that aren\u2019t as healthful. Make baby steps. If I\u2019m craving a chocolate bar I have something _much_ more decadent like a bite of an expensive dark chocolate bar instead. If I\u2019m craving cookies or cake it\u2019s time for a high fiber high protein fruit bar or something. Plus keep around as much veg as you can like carrots, celery, sweet peppers\u2014even with some hummus or guacamole, even if you mindlessly eat it all because you\u2019re tired and hungry, it\u2019s still better for you. Also you\u2019re too busy/tired of chewing to want more food!  (I had to reform my diet due to a borderline diabetes/high cholesterol diagnosis and my doctor forbade me eat white food if a brown version was available-bread, rice, potatoes etc to start. I got better and better at choosing more healthful options until I barely have to think about it anymore and I\u2019m in the best shape of my life in my forties and don\u2019t deprive myself at all. It\u2019s a process, and you\u2019re getting better at it!  Just keep an eye on that little voice in the back of your head and when it starts talking like your family, remind it that you\u2019re in charge. Eating disorders are way more unhealthy than being overweight.", "Better yet, speak to the doctor privately.\n\nOP: if they insist on going in with you, just say to the doctor, \"I would like to speak with you privately.\" Then tell the doctor everything that is going on just like you told us in this post. Let the professionals take it from there.", "Agreed that \"Table, plate, chair\" is an excellent way to avoid taking/eating too much without realizing it until that entire carton of Cherry Garcia is gone.\n\nNothing goes on your mouth unless it is on a table, you are in a chair, and the portion of food you intend to eat is served out on a plate with the rest put away.\n\nSeconds is ok, but not until 10-15 minutes after you have finished the first plateful and determined that you really are still hungry. Then again it's table, plate, chair.", "Eventually they get past that and can\u2019t touch the stuff. Not so with food.", "Don't conflate one thing for another. OP is not blaming anyone and it's been proven that she's capable of losing weight on her own. Whether she managed to shut out every pizza ad or had the discipline to not visit a cake shop, it worked for her.\n\nOP is not to blame for someone deliberately sabotaging her by triggering her addiction.", "I am learning how to manage weight loss and untangle weird stuff like this but as i\u2019m sure u can appreciate it\u2019s not a thing you learn in a few months, i\u2019ve had an unhealthy relationship with food for a while and therefore i still slip up my bad!!! Im trying to take accountability i know that i physically put the stuff into my mouth, i know i\u2019m at this weight by my eating habits and i\u2019m trying to fix it now but i think there\u2019s a difference between me watching an commercial for pizza and having my sister purposely try to ruin my diet ?", "If you haven't been through eating disorder it'll just show you're talking out of ignorance. If you indeed had been through that it'll just show that you're a cold hearted person who lacks empathy.\n\nSo tell me, which is worse?", "Yes, but my diet has significantly changed after a lot of allergy and food sensitivity testing.  Chocolate is one of the few pleasures I have that doesn't make me sick!  \n\nCutting all of the shit out of my diet that was making me sick was the major step.  Portion control is what has helped me sustain and continue my weight loss over the last several years.  I also struggled with binging, but the things I used to binge on would now launch a nuclear war on my stomach.  That's a pretty strong deterrent for me.  I also feel freaking amazing and no food is worth this feeling.", "I get the Hershey's miniatures.  According to the bag a serving is 4 pieces and its 170 calories per serving.", "I think it helps the OP to learn how to recognise that there are people out there who are going to sabotage her, which is what the sister is doing, and avoid them as best she can. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to imply that the idea that the sister is trying to sabotage her is all in her head, which is what your original comment did.", "Sister is probably scared because without OP there, their parents will start looking for a new target...", "This right here... I would definitely dispose of it when she and your parents aren't around, or she'll definitely look for some other way to mess with your progress. Stay strong \ud83d\udc9c", "Going in alone would be better they\u2019re an adult OP\u2019s parent doesn\u2019t need to be in there.", "OP still had a choice whether the trigger was deliberate or not and that's the point.", "Im sorry if this comment comes across as overly mean or frustrated or something it\u2019s been a really long day and i get that i will have to adjust to just seeing fast food commercials or something i just think there\u2019s a difference between my sister and those. If u want my honest answer i am craving the foods i used to eat 24/7 atp like i can\u2019t lie it\u2019s bad so yeah i probably should\u2019ve been doing better in terms of self control for what my sister offered me too but i just need to work past it i guess", "Yep so cold hearted to expect personal responsibility from a person\u2026. If she doesn\u2019t accept that she is the one who keeps saying yes, no matter who or what is influencing her, she will never get control of her addiction and get better.", "If that\u2019s the case, I have to wonder if the parents are actually sick in the head.", "What? If something is deliberate is up to the person initiating it, in this case her sister. I don\u2019t think you understand what that word means.", "Don\u2019t worry you discredit yourself.", "I mean, they\u2019re sick in the head whether it\u2019s the case or not. It\u2019s not like we all get one \u2018throwaway\u2019 child who it\u2019s perfectly fine to torture but if you mistreat the other one, THAT\u2019s wrong and bad. There\u2019s something really really wrong with the whole family except op. \n\nNTA op but go away for college and just\u2026don\u2019t come back?  \u201cI have to work over the summer for extra credit/money/opportunities but I really miss you guys \ud83d\ude00\u201d. College is also going to be the time in your life when you\u2019ll probably have the most access to different types of exercise and (important!) therapy!  Avail yourself!  And until you can go, pretend you\u2019re in a fairytale and all food your sister brings home is poisoned.   That will really get her goat and it\u2019s not like she can complain about it without sounding crazy.   Good job taking control of what you can and dont give up!", "No this person does not know, how an ED messes with your brain. \n\nI was 16, when I got an ED and refused to eat. I counted every calorie. \"Oh I had a cup of tea, that is x calories.\" It took me two years to stop counting calories. \n\nAnd if I start today to track my calories (after over 15 years fighting and surviving my ED) my brain will try to starve myself again! So I do not track my calories and I do not even track how much water, tea or coffee I had in a day. \n\nI asked all my friends, not to tell me, when they are on a diet, because it could trigger my ED. \n\nIt is something, that you struggle for your whole live!", "I've struggled with binging my whole life.  I grew up with a parent who went out of their way to bring home every single thing I loved to binge every time I tried to lose weight.  I also spent every other weekend with a step parent who counted every calorie I ate.  At the end of the day I made the choice to eat like shit, no one else."]}
