When I went to a bar he\u2019s a regular at, they asked me for my ID which I thought was odd (but not too odd, it just doesn\u2019t happen as often anymore). He then made a comment about how the waitress must have confused me with someone else. When I asked him who, he said the last girl he dated. So naturally, I asked him if she was under 21. It turns out she was 19. Since then, it has bothered me so much. \n\nWhen I asked for more information about it, he said that his friend Gary (37M) was dating her at the time but that she (Paula, 19F) was about to be homeless, so his Gary asked Alex if she could stay with him. He said yes, so Paula lived with my bf for almost a year, but after a few months she and Gary broke up. Paula and Alex ended up dating for about half a year while she was living with him. \n\nI asked Alex if he thought it was wrong that Gary dated her given their age difference, and he said no. I also asked him if he thought it was wrong to date her with the same reasoning, and he said no. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve been to bars in college towns at 29/30 and every guy there has seemed like a child to me. Maybe it\u2019s just one of my \u201cvalues\u201d that dating someone that\u2019s in a much different stage of life than you is wrong. Mostly when that stage of life is barely having lived. \n\nI\u2019m honestly just so creeped out by this. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve made jokes as my coping mechanism, but he said that he\u2019s hurt by them, which I understand. Some of the jokes are along the lines of \u201coh you\u2019re near a high school, your hunting grounds\u201d or \u201cyour friend is about to turn 18, you should text her to hang out on her birthday because she\u2019ll finally be legal\u201d. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667616471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymi4vd/aita_for_making_jokes_about_my_sos_past/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You also shouldn\u2019t have been laughing at that relationship when your bf clearly has been telling you he\u2019s not comfortable with it. Coping mechanism of yours or not.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel like you can come to terms with his previous relationship at all, break up. \n\nJust to be clear, you don\u2019t HAVE to come to terms with it. I think your feelings are valid. Just not the degrading jokes to him. You should find someone who has the same values as you and he needs to find someone who thinks an age gap relationship with a barely legal adult is okay.", "YTA. Leave him or quit making the jokes.", "If it bothers you so much - and it should; it\u2019s icky - you should probably just not date him anymore. ESH.", "She was of legal age when they hooked up and living together probably just facilitated that. Is it a good look? I guess it depends on who you ask.\n\nYou\u2019re assuming she was \u201cin a different stage of life\u201d but unless you know her personally, it\u2019s not fair to her to make that assumption. Also, just because it feels icky to you, the reality is, your boyfriend didn\u2019t do anything illegal. Your opinion that, at 19, you\u2019ve \u201cbarely lived,\u201d is simply that \u2014 an opinion. Projecting your personal beliefs onto someone you don\u2019t know that isn\u2019t even a part of your bf\u2019s present can be unhealthy and is clearly destroying your relationship.\n\nIn the early days of the internet I ended up meeting a guy sixteen years older than me. Four days after I turned 18 (yes, I was 17 when I started a relationship with him) I basically pressured him to take me in after another huge fight with my parents and we were together for almost 3 years. We actually had a lot in common so it wasn\u2019t a stretch to be in a relationship with him and I got along really well with his friends and family. I\u2019ve since married someone my age but we\u2019ve both been transparent about our past relationships which have sometimes been unconventional. Do we judge each other for them? No. Why? Because all of that happened before we knew each other and those experiences may even be part of the reason we\u2019re together now.\n\nYour \u201ccoping mechanism\u201d stops becoming one as soon as your acknowledged he is clearly hurt by them. You\u2019re taking what he\u2019s done in HIS past and now trying to use it to judge him in your relationship. You liked him prior to this revelation and he\u2019s currently dating someone his age so why  does it matter what happened before you?\n\nIf you\u2019re that hung up about this to where you can\u2019t even control yourself from making snide remarks and obsessing about it, I suggest you find someone else to date and perhaps not ask them about their past lest you find it distasteful. \n\nSoft YTA but only because I\u2019m not trying to invalidate your feelings, just suggesting you rethink your narratives.", "A bit of an AH. You're certainly NTAH for your own feelings, just to be clear. The jokes may make you feel better about something you're possibly struggling with, but he's also supposed to be someone YOU care about. Hurting their feelings to make yourself feel better isn't healthy. This was before you, clearly it didn't work out between them and although the age difference is admittedly creepy they were by law 2 consenting adults.", "NTA\n\nOp please do better than this guy", "YTA. Your S/O has specifically said he doesn't like the jokes you make so continuing to do that is just directly putting you in the wrong. Its not my place to judge on the validity of your discomfort, only you know whether you can get over that or not but hurting his feelings does not help the situation.", "ESH. His relationship with a 19 year old was gross. But you joking about it is also gross. It minimizes it, and frankly adds an element of toxicity to your relationship. \n\nThere are things that couples joke about and have as their inside jokes. But if they ask you to stop, you stop. If you find something worth mocking them over to that extent and still continue to mock them when they ask you to stop - is that someone you really want to be with? Because at that stage you\u2019re bullying them, and while yeah, he was gross in his past choices, what can be said about his current choices?", "I think you should look deep down within yourself by listening to your conscience and realize that if you need to make jokes like this as a coping mechanism, he is not the one for you. \n\nNTA.", "YTA completely. You care about him? Then stop making fun of him in a snide sarcastic way. They were both adults and could choose to date or not. You're the one acting like a teenager right now and it's an ugly look. If it bothers you so much then break up with him. But yeah YTA for treating him how you are.", "NTA, 38M, so close to his age and I think of anyone under 30 being too young.  I think 25 would be the oldest I would have date a 19 year old.  The acceptable gap increases with age.", "YTA. Dump him.", "Is it really jokes if the one who they\u2019re aimed at isn\u2019t laughing? And you know he doesn\u2019t like it but continue to do it? So in fact it\u2019s more like mean spirited teasing or bullying. \n\nIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like the age gap. But then it\u2019s best to leave and not constantly put him down. \n\nYTA", "NTA but this guy is a serious creep, I would be too disgusted to ever look at him again. You\u2019re 30, you know what a 19 year old is and how vulnerable they are, your hopefully soon to be ex and his friend are predators.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Punishing him and belittling him with stinging jokes does nothing beneficial for either of you.  Unless you are getting off on making him feel bad - ?  \n\nI am not addressing his behavior,  which I think is your real goal in posting this.  You want people to tell you that he was an AH for being with a 19 year old.  However, even if he was, that doesn't excuse your own behavior.  He did nothing illegal, and if you consider it immoral or wrong, that's up to you.  But if you can't get past it,  then leave the relationship.  Needling him won't change the past", "Yep! This is exactly what I was thinking too, but was way too tired to put into words!"]}
