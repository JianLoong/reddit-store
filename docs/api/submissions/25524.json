He was in the military and about a year in to our marriage, he received orders to be relocated overseas. I was nervous but I have no family so there really was no reason for me to stay. Two days before we were due to leave, I found emails between him and his ex and he had been cheating on me. I no longer had a job or house because I had given them both up to move and all my worldly possessions were on a boat. My husband begged me to not leave him so I agreed and moved with him. \n\nAbout two years later, I was 8 weeks pregnant when I found out my husband was cheating again and got the woman pregnant. I told him I wanted a divorce and again begged me to at least stay while he finished his work contract. He didn\u2019t want to miss our baby being born. He assured me I would still have a ticket home funded by the military when we left. \n\nI stayed. I got a job and moved into a very small studio apartment. I ended up losing the baby a few weeks after, which I assume was due to the stress. At this point, I was already locked in a lease for a year and decided to stay until his contract was up. A month before he was due to leave, our divorce finalized. My ex husband had racked up a lot of debt on useless stuff, and that debt was equally split between us. He was also supposed to begin paying alimony for a period of 18 months. It was at this time I found out I would not have a plane ticket home. \n\nMy ex husband has never paid a dime of the alimony. For a little over a year and a half, I have struggled to get my credit back on track after the divorce, and to pay down the debt he left me with so it doesn\u2019t go to collections. I sleep on a bed mat on the floor, barely have any money left over each month after bills to eat with, and I pray everyday that my old car doesn\u2019t give out because the smallest rivet in my finances will ruin me. I am lonely and tired of being overseas in a country where I can\u2019t speak the language. I want to move back to the states but can\u2019t afford a plane ticket, let alone deposit and rent for a new place. I make the best of it but I often wonder what I did wrong in the past to receive this karma. \n\nPresent day- my ex reached out to me a few days ago asking me to go to a notary and have a paper signed. His lawyer sent it over and it is a financial document asking me to forgive the nearly $9,000 in alimony that he owes me. The reason he is asking me to do this is because he says he now has a warrant for his arrest and has lost his passport due to the balance he owes. He says he is only asking me because his father lives overseas and is sick and he needs to go see him. If I don\u2019t sign the paper, he won\u2019t get his passport back until he pays the bill. I could really use the money but I also don\u2019t want to be spiteful because of how much he hurt me. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole if I don\u2019t sign the paper and possibly cause my ex to never see his sick father again before he dies?", "created_utc": 1693023011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161kr49/aita_for_causing_my_ex_husband_to_not_see_his/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you think he feels guilty about all the hell he has put you through? \nYou deserve better.", "Not true, you can get a judgment against him in a court of law and garnish his check, there are a lot of things you can do. Remember - **if the debt was meaningless, he wouldn't want you to sign it away.**", "He is only saying that to guilt you into forgiving the money. You have two scenarios:\n\n1. You forgive the debt and he is free to live his life how he pleases despite treating you poorly and leaving you in a bad financial position. You never see the money.\n\n2. You refuse to sign the document. Maybe you never see the money but how is that any different than if you forgive the debt? At least by not signing he is still on the hook for the debt.

He got what he deserved. But the military takes cheating very seriously, id look into that as well.", "NTA I wonder if his father is even sick? This guy is a liar.", "NTA don\u2019t sign nothing", "Spiteful? What? NO! Don\u2019t sign. NTA!l!", "**Karma didn\u2019t do this to you, you did it to yourself.**\n\nNTA and don\u2019t sign, but wtf, you *need* to do some deep soul searching to figure out why you would *choose* to follow this cheater all over the world at the expense of your stability.", "NTA. Don't sign a damn thing for that ah until the check clears and the money is 100 percent in your account with no adjustments possible. He can get a loan from his family, friends, or any bank stupid enough to give it to him. You have given him enough.", "Get paid the alimony the rest is made up bullshit.  He lied about the plane ticket, the cheating and this everything out of his mouth is a lie.  Don\u2019t believe the bullshit, NTA\n\nEven if it is true he made your life hell with the debt he can help pay it off.  He still believes his life is more important then yours he could have dealt with all of this already.  Let him go to jail.", "NTA Even if you are the asshole, so what? Really, at this point, why do you care? He has worn you down to the point where all you worry about is him and that's just heartbreaking. You don't need to do anything for him. You don't need to worry about him. You need to keep focused on yourself. You deserve better.", "NTA I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EX'S STORY FOR A SINGLE MINUTE!", "NTA \n\nDON\u2019T SIGN IT. You deserve and NEED the money from your cheating ex. Please update us", "NTA. If you remove some of the specifics, an acquaintance is effectively asking you to pay $9000 you don\u2019t have to fund a trip to go see his father, which he is unable to do because of his own poor decisions and life choices. It\u2019s not your fiscal, social, legal or moral responsibility to help dig him out of his own hole.\n\nAnd just be clear, removing the specifics makes HIM look better and it still makes you NTA.\n\nAdd everything back in and you\u2019re definitely NTA. I am truly sorry for the situation you are in, but the less you interact with him outside collecting the money he owes you the better.\n\nEdit: Also, just to be clear, it would not be surprising if you forgive the money and in 3 months see a picture on Facebook of his healthy and happy father. Liars don\u2019t stop being liars over night and given his track record he is banking on a sob story getting you to side with him.", "Say no and if he tries to guilt you again say \"You made the choice to not pay the alimony and rack up this debt yourself. I have been stranded here due to taking on your debt for a year and a half already and the entitlement of you asking me to do so again is so dishonorable I can't imagine anyone wanting to see you in their dying moments. Pay me what you owe me or face the law/justice for your cruelty to me.\"", "NTA\n\nHis fault.", "No, no, no.  NTA.\n\nYou're being too nice, to your detriment.  All of that is **not your problem anymore**.  You need to raise heck, and get the money you need to go back home and reboot your life.\n\nYour ex only has himself to blame for not being able to get back to his Dad.  He didn't just cheat on you (twice!) and impregnate his second affair partner.  He has an arrest warrant out!  \n\nThis isn't about being vindictive.  This is about being able to leave a country you never would have gone to except for him.  Put his feet to the fire, and get as good a lawyer as you can, because I'd be willing to bet he's going to try to hide money, if he hasn't already done so.", "NTA do not forgive the debt. You are struggling. You need the alimony.", "NTA. He is manipulating you. Let him know that the only way his debt is being cleared is by paying it.", "He screwed you big time. Screw him. Don't sign anything. I am sorry for your situation but it was a series bad decision made by you. NTA.", "Fuck that guy. You take care of you.", "Nta he fucked around and found out. It's about time you held him accountable.", "Hey OP i've read your comments please start thinking logically.\n\nHe's told you if you don't sign you wont see the money anyway.\n\nHe's left you in a foreign country alone and you don't want to ask strangers for help and have no family or friends to go to.\n\nIf you got ill and needed to go back home - he wouldn't care if you died.\n\nThere is only one thing he needs from you that you can use as leverage and that is his passport. You will never get home if you agree to write off the debt. He needs to get to his father - and if its true he is ill ( i don't believe it), then he can move heaven and earth to buy you a ticket + half the amount owed. He can go to the bank, ask his military colleagues, borrow from a loan shark, beg his family, beg his neighbours - he can do all that. In fact he can raise the whole 9K and clear his whole debt if he is really wants to see his dad. Its his choice.\n\nNEVER EVER SIGN THAT DOCUMENT. Either ask for a ticket and half and you'll clear the rest or go for the full amount - its up to how much you need to get home.  If his father passes away he still needs to get to the funeral. if he wants to go on holiday he still needs a passport. If he is lying about his dad and just wants to visit - he needs a passport. One day him needing a passport will push him to pay you. If you want to expedite it then ask for your ticket and expenses to find a place to live for 3 months plus deposit so you get back on your feet.\n\nAlso he has money for your flight if he has money to fly to his dads.\n\nRemember he doesnt care if you die or rot away in a foreign country. Even if he is telling the truth - if it was me and i needed to get to a sick parent - I'd get the money and then deal with the consequences - loan shark, bank, sell everything, ask every neighbour in the street, ask for help on social media, set up a go fund me, beg every friend, beg every family member, old school friends, colleagues.  You are saying you have no one - well you have leverage - dont give it up. If he says you wont get a dollar anyway - then you have nothing to lose by not signing off the debt. He pays you in full or an amount acceptable to to you to get home if you are desperate - at least half - but dont sign anything away before that.", "Oh honey. He and the situation he has put you through has almost broken you. Do not feel sorry for him. Protect your own heart. He doesn\u2019t care and neither should you. You need a plan to get back. Don\u2019t let his sobbing stories distract you from that. Even if true, it isn\u2019t your responsibility to continue to suffer just to make things easier for him.  NTA and I think it\u2019s time you start putting him through hell. His turn.", "NTA\n\nHe cares more about his father than you late baby.\nYou paid his debts and he didn't care that he was at fault.\n\nIt's his doing and karma is coming to collect his \"debts\"", "He deserves everything coming his way.

The IRS loves [tips](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/how-do-you-report-suspected-tax-fraud-activity) about Insurance Fraud, just as a heads up. The IRS also gives financial awards for reporting fraud, which probably won't be much, but at the very least could probably help you afford food or a ticket back.", "Oh so basically he told you not to sign sounds good because he is a dead beat either way.  He can stay in country then.  Tell him his fate is tied to yours.  He brought you into this country and he is going to have to take you back if he wants to go back.  \n\nJust a question ask the lawyer if the free legal benefit also applies to former spouses of those who served?", "One thing that another poster has pointed out is that the ex could just be lying about his Dad to weasel out of the warrant out on him, a possibility which is leant credence by the fact that the ex absolutely will not negotiate any favourable outcomes for the OP if she signs, like a plane ticket home.\n\n> I\u2019ve already offered this to him and he refused. It\u2019s not like I want to be in this situation but he\u2019s not budging or compromising\n\nIf he\u2019s not willing compromise at all on this, it\u2019s entirely possible that he\u2019s lying yet again to the OP to screw her over.", "He got out of the military one month after the payments were to begin. So I couldn\u2019t go to them.", "I am not trying to be one sided at all. But everything I\u2019m saying is true. He lied and cheated and then because I chose to leave him for those reasons, he acted like it was my fault we split.", " Nope let him enjoy what he created.", "Here for this. OP is in no universe an asshole just because the ex is stupid and his house of cards finally blew away in the wind. Is it kinda awesome the courts have given a karmic justice in her favor? Absolutely. But she's not petty for refusing to \"forgive\" a massive debt he racked up for being unfaithful and dipping out of the marriage.", "Right?! At every stage, he's given OP a fairy tale and she's accepted his story in the hope he'll deal honestly with her. But this guy doesn't have an honest bone in his body and has broken every promise he's made. \n\nOP needs to finally put her foot down and stand up for her own needs. He owes her a lot of money. It's his own damned fault that he owes her that money - if he'd paid in the installments he was supposed to, then she would be in a much better financial position and he wouldn't be barred from getting on a plane/have a warrant out for his arrest. She absolutely should not forgive that debt!", "How is his alimony not being deducted from his paycheck automatically?\n\nI've seen it forcibly removed from couples who have been married at least 10 years.", "Yup when it is his life it is important.  But everyone else who cares.", "Yeah no point.  Unless they would pay off the alimony.", "Stop listening to a word out of his lying mouth.", "Oh well if you are never seeing the money then you have no motivation to sign anything. He presumably has an income of some type so he can make some payments when this thing becomes important enough to him.", "Do not take advice from your enemies lol", "K, after that out of spite I would find another way to get home and let him rot.  Secondly they are ways, assume if he says it the opposite is true.", "Please keep in mind that your ex has lied to you before and screwed you over, he is very likely lying to you again to screw you over.", "Ok-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt least don't forgive his debt - this money belongs to your kid (and you, as the kid's caretaker).", "I'm saying it's one sided in your favor OP.

That sounds like a dishonorable discharge or something.  They don\u2019t abandon folks in country or did he desert?", "Well then there is your answer.
