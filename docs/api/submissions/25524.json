He was in the military and about a year in to our marriage, he received orders to be relocated overseas. I was nervous but I have no family so there really was no reason for me to stay. Two days before we were due to leave, I found emails between him and his ex and he had been cheating on me. I no longer had a job or house because I had given them both up to move and all my worldly possessions were on a boat. My husband begged me to not leave him so I agreed and moved with him. \n\nAbout two years later, I was 8 weeks pregnant when I found out my husband was cheating again and got the woman pregnant. I told him I wanted a divorce and again begged me to at least stay while he finished his work contract. He didn\u2019t want to miss our baby being born. He assured me I would still have a ticket home funded by the military when we left. \n\nI stayed. I got a job and moved into a very small studio apartment. I ended up losing the baby a few weeks after, which I assume was due to the stress. At this point, I was already locked in a lease for a year and decided to stay until his contract was up. A month before he was due to leave, our divorce finalized. My ex husband had racked up a lot of debt on useless stuff, and that debt was equally split between us. He was also supposed to begin paying alimony for a period of 18 months. It was at this time I found out I would not have a plane ticket home. \n\nMy ex husband has never paid a dime of the alimony. For a little over a year and a half, I have struggled to get my credit back on track after the divorce, and to pay down the debt he left me with so it doesn\u2019t go to collections. I sleep on a bed mat on the floor, barely have any money left over each month after bills to eat with, and I pray everyday that my old car doesn\u2019t give out because the smallest rivet in my finances will ruin me. I am lonely and tired of being overseas in a country where I can\u2019t speak the language. I want to move back to the states but can\u2019t afford a plane ticket, let alone deposit and rent for a new place. I make the best of it but I often wonder what I did wrong in the past to receive this karma. \n\nPresent day- my ex reached out to me a few days ago asking me to go to a notary and have a paper signed. His lawyer sent it over and it is a financial document asking me to forgive the nearly $9,000 in alimony that he owes me. The reason he is asking me to do this is because he says he now has a warrant for his arrest and has lost his passport due to the balance he owes. He says he is only asking me because his father lives overseas and is sick and he needs to go see him. If I don\u2019t sign the paper, he won\u2019t get his passport back until he pays the bill. I could really use the money but I also don\u2019t want to be spiteful because of how much he hurt me. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole if I don\u2019t sign the paper and possibly cause my ex to never see his sick father again before he dies?", "created_utc": 1693023011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161kr49/aita_for_causing_my_ex_husband_to_not_see_his/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you think he feels guilty about all the hell he has put you through? \nYou deserve better.", "Not true, you can get a judgment against him in a court of law and garnish his check, there are a lot of things you can do. Remember - **if the debt was meaningless, he wouldn't want you to sign it away.**", "He is only saying that to guilt you into forgiving the money. You have two scenarios:\n\n1. You forgive the debt and he is free to live his life how he pleases despite treating you poorly and leaving you in a bad financial position. You never see the money.\n\n2. You refuse to sign the document. Maybe you never see the money but how is that any different than if you forgive the debt? At least by not signing he is still on the hook for the debt. Sooner or later the consequences of having this debt will hopefully catch up to him and something big enough of an incentive will come up to make him pay it. All he has to do is pay the debt and he can have the freedom he wants. Depending on how extensive the document is and how far he wants to push the matter using a lawyer he\u2019ll potentially spend more money trying to avoid the debt than if he just paid up.\n\nStuff him, he was ordered to pay you that money for a reason. Don\u2019t give him the easy way out", "That is literally not your problem, its his to figure out. He treated you like shit for 8 years then kept treating you like shit, and now has come up with some kind of honestly fake sounding plan to get out of it.\n\nthey probably just told him he was going to get his wages garnished and hes upset about it", "Then what's your incentive to sign it?", "Well then he will never see his family.", "Then what is the motivation to sign?\n\nIDK but it kinda sounds like he just shot himself in the foot with that comment.", "I\u2019ve contacted a few in the past but they wouldn\u2019t take me on because I wasn\u2019t in the states and couldn\u2019t afford a retainer. But I\u2019ll look into this again. Thank you.", "Dang sorry to hear OP.  It\u2019s strange thing for a government to do.", "same thought!", "I don\u2019t have family and the few friends I have haven\u2019t been able to help. I didn\u2019t know that getting the divorced finalized before we left meant they no longer has a responsibility to get me back. He is no longer military. I am from the United States and am in Asia currently.", "This is a good idea. I will try to talk to him about it. I think to move back to the US, deposit and first months rent, etc I\u2019m looking at at least $6k so not sure if he will go for it but it\u2019s worth a shot. Thank you for the help.", "I don\u2019t know why I feel guilty. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have family so I feel sad when I think it\u2019s possibly the last time he could see his dad. I know it\u2019s not rational to feel this way but I\u2019m a very empathetic person.", "There is no incentive. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s a human being and I\u2019m very empathetic. If it\u2019s true his father is sick, I feel for him and feel sad he may not be able to say goodbye. I know it\u2019s not rational, especially when I literally have no money to my name. I often can only eat once a day because of how broke I am, sleep on a floor mat instead of a mattress, have very few furniture pieces in my house, can\u2019t even afford to pay for my own Netflix or Spotify because every dollar counts. But for some reason I still feel sad when I think about his father dying and not being able to say bye to his only son. I know it\u2019s my ex\u2019s fault\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t make me feel any less sad.", "Keep trying the US Embassy. You are a US citizen they do have a duty of care to you. Keep trying and don't give up.", "heck start a gofundme. there are worse ones than i need money so i can fly home", "You\u2019re welcome. Don\u2019t forget, you hold all of the cards. You think he does, but as long as he isn\u2019t paying you he doesn\u2019t have a passport and apparently he really wants that back.\n\nYou hold all of the cards.", "He is a liar. Don't believe him. If it was important to him he would find a way to pay you what he owes you. It's his choice.\n\nGuilt - accept that as an empathetic person you will feel guilty but you don't need to act on it. Making your ex stick to a bargain will be good for him. It won't make him happy but it will make him (a little) better.", "It\u2019s probably not even true, he\u2019s just playing you to get the debt removed.", "Don't feel guilty. Do you think he feels guilty about what he's done to you?", "Yeah, it's sad. But anyway, he just needs to pay you the money instead of paying a lawyer and his problem is solved.\n\nOr maybe it won't be solved because he has a warrant of arrest, so maybe they won't let him go overseas anyway. Oh well.", "You might also contact the local representative for your USA home state, where you were before moving overseas. They might be able to make some noise on your behalf.", "To be honest, I\u2019ve never told anyone the extent of what\u2019s going on. But even so, I don\u2019t have family and I have very few friends in the world. And I\u2019d feel really world about even trying to ask for money. \n\nI honestly just want to go back to USA so I can have conversations with people and have friends again. Maybe find someone someday to be my person. I\u2019m so lonely and it\u2019s very isolating to be in a place that you have absolutely no one.", "I was just gonna suggest/say this exact thing. GoFundMe. You've got Reddit behind you.", "Absolutely not lol. But he\u2019s a narcissist so he doesn\u2019t feel much \ud83d\ude05", "Absolutely NTA. You need that money to get home.", "don\u2019t sign anything! nta", "I sure would not sign.", "NTA you just don\u2019t forgive that amount of money wtf", "Nah at all. I say do not do this for him. If you donhe will never respect you. You have been through so much. He owes you this money and he should pay it.", "He is probably lying about his father.  Can you contact his family?", "NTA. Don\u2019t sign anything.", "You dont want to be spiteful?! This man ruined your life! He cheated on you multiple times, he made you move to another country because of him, you are basicly kidnap at this country because you have no money to go back home, your credit is ruined because of his debt!!!!! Be spiteful, women! For once, fight for what is yours!!!! This men will never learn! You were good and kind to him way more than he deserved and yet he stab you on the back each time! \nMake him pay for what he owns you!! If he doesnt pay, he cant be trapped at that country like you are/were! \n\nNTA. You will be if you gave this men another chance/an act of kindness after hes done to you. Hope your life gets better\n\nEdit to say: dont sign anything!!! Tell him you will sign when you are back in USA, he can pay for you to go back. If he does that, when you land there dont sign anything! Let him tast of his own medicine!", "If I were in your position, I would sign. However, if you chose not to sign NTA. You are not in the wrong. If you sign that's great, if you don't that's okay. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhere I'm from, we call these situations 'consequences'.", "NTA he screwed you over in multiple ways. You\u2019re entitled to your money and are struggling deeply with the debt you have.", "If he\u2019s telling you he\u2019ll never give you a penny of the alimony anyway, why not sign the papers in exchange for a plane ticket home so you can at least get out of the country where you don\u2019t speak the language, sleep on a mat and pray your old car doesn\u2019t break down because it will ruin you?", "If he really wants to see his father he would be willing to make things right with you.\n\nSince he is a lier, why would he suddenly be telling you the truth now?\n\nIt's great to be empathic, but it's a bummer to be played, given his history there is a very good chance this is just another episode of smoke and mirrors.\n\nGood luck getting home!!!", "I think you may be the first person to *possibly* understand why I\u2019m having a hard time with this. Thank you!", "OP, your ex has lied and deceived you for years. He's left you on the brink of ruin, you really think his father is sick and dying? He probably needs to get back to the states for other personal business and is trying to emotionally manipulate you. If you sign away any alimony you're entitled too, whatever comes later is solely on you.", "I did not know you could be given your partners debts In a divorce !!", "An yet you feel guilty for not helping him again?!!?", "I\u2019ve already offered this to him and he refused. It\u2019s not like I want to be in this situation but he\u2019s not budging or compromising.", "Yes you can if it was incurred during the marriage it's marital property so to speak. Does it make it right ethically no.", "Then he clearly doesn\u2019t want to see his dad, a plane ticket from Asia to the US is several hundred dollars at most, waaaaay less than the 9k he owes.\n\nDon\u2019t sign anything.", "He purposefully stranded you in a foreign country after coercing you to follow him there through his rife infidelity. \n\nI agree with the proposed compromise: tell him 7k and you\u2019ll sign. He\u2019ll say 5. You say the lowest you can afford is 6. \n\nAnd even then he\u2019ll be getting off really cheap.", "I believe you are a very kind human but at some point you need to start learning from your past mistakes and not keep repeating them. \n\nYou are in this situation because your ex took advantage of you. At some point though you need to say I need to look out for myself first and not empathise with him. Be empathetic to yourself first. Look out for your best interest first. Put yourself first. \n\nYou always seem to give in to him, believing his lies, at some point you have to wake up and stop being such a doormat. \n\nI don\u2019t want to beat you while you are down, but all these people here are telling you that you shouldn\u2019t believe him any longer and look out for your own interests first and you still go on about you not being able to help yourself helping him because of your ..let me check my notes\u2026.empathy ?? Like Wtf! \n\nDo what\u2019s best for you and not for him. \n\nWith all my heart I am wishing you the best \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "> he\u2019s a human being and I\u2019m very empathetic.\n\nso what if his father is sick? does he CARE about his father? be real.", "Do you think your ex only eats once a day? \n\nHe can afford a plane ticket to fly overseas to visit his dying father. He could afford to pay you what he owes if he wanted to.", "Go fund me is a cracking idea", "He's manipulating you to get what he wants. You should be putting you first."]}
