Some people only buy practical things. Some only buy frivolous stuff. Some look for one special thing. Some go for quantity over quality. \n\nWhen these philosophies don't mesh, hurt feelings will happen somewhere. \n\n\"It's the thought that counts\" is usually wielded to mean \"they thought of you, be grateful.\" My personal response to that has always been \"this is an object I don't want, didn't ask for, and anyone who knows me would know that I hate it. No thought or effort was put into this gift. They didn't even pick up the phone to ask me if I would like it. They assumed, wasted money, and I should be thankful that they flushed all that money away on something worthless?\"\n\nYou were extremely polite. You made one request to remove a category of gifts. They didn't care enough to do so.", "I think this one just comes down to tone. Did you say, \u201cyou need to return this\u201d in a flat monotone, or did you say something like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I hope you kept the receipt, because these aren\u2019t my size\u201d in a caring tone?  \nWording and tone will make all the difference in whether you were an AH about it.  \nBut I\u2019m totally on your side as to how annoying that is.

I recognize this behavior in my own parent who enjoyed finding good \u201cdeals\u201d so much that the thrill of buying something cheap sometimes overtook any rationality when it came to whether anyone would actually want to wear/use it. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s where your aunts are necessarily coming from, but the outcome seems similar. Because that parent foisted so much of that stuff on me it made me miserable, sometimes even guilty when I wanted to shop for my own things. It also felt like that parent, when they bought clothes that were the wrong size, was seeing me in a different body size than I actually was and that actually impacted my own self image as well. It took me years to unlearn and even now I can have anxiety about seeing myself in new clothes. So I don\u2019t at all think you\u2019re in the wrong for finally trying to put a stop for it. Unfortunately my parent persisted for years even when I started trying to reject the \u201cgifts\u201d, though I admittedly wasn\u2019t as self aware at the time and didn\u2019t communicate with my parent properly, and was also very emotionally dependent on my validating their actions, which didn\u2019t help. I hope your aunts will be somewhat more reasonable and come around.", "NTA but also\u2014gift receipts exist for this reason", "Maybe you can sell them online or alter the clothes", "yes! thank you. that third paragraph is something ive always said and nobody gets it. i get frustrated", "um im known to be quite harsh in tone but these women helped raise me and my whole family is harsh in tone, so i wouldnt rule out bad delivery especially because i was anxious and annoyed and hurt. but in my head it was a gentle \u201cyou guys can return these because they wont fit.\u201d \n\ni also can have a wicked \u2018tude but i was really trying not to have one when i said it.", "yeah unfortunately i dont think they\u2019re reasonable people. i think theyre both very mentally ill but theyre old fashioned and \u201cdon\u2019t believe in that\u201d so theyre not the easiest to handle.", "they never give gift receipts but also id really rather they just keep the money", "thats a good idea. though, i dont even know how qvc sells these clothes", "Expect to continue being frustrated. I've been having this argument with my mother for thirty years.", "I understand that. It seems like they\u2019re unwilling to stop buying you gifts at all. Perhaps asking for gift receipts would be a way for them to keep buying you gifts (likely to massage their own ego) and you to get things that suit your style & fit you.", "yeah. im also allergic to nuts and they give me trailmix every year", "yeah ill try that. i just wish logic was an option", "I'm sorry. It sucks.", "well it sucks in the weirdest of ways too because it makes you feel awful about yourself for being ungrateful but at the same time youre annoyed and you really just want them to have more money. \n\nlike yes- what a privileged problem to have. but also this is a problem caused by wanting others to have more and knowing that you dont always need more and more and more. like i just want them to stop wasting their money when all i really need for christmas is a card and some quality time", "Yep. \n\nMy mother was raised by a frugal scots woman who lived through the great depression. And she raised me. I have zero problems buying myself practical, functional things like a vacuum or dishes. But frivolous stuff? I feel guilty so I put it on my wishlist. And then my mother asks what I want and I point her to my wish list and she doesn't buy anything on it \"because it's all so old\" but what she means is \"it's frivolous and not a practical things so I won't buy it.\" So instead she buys me random things she thinks I might find useful. Which I don't need and is just clutter.\n\nSo I'm left with this irritating choice of being without a vacuum for six months because it died in June, or saving it for Christmas just to make her happy. Otherwise she'll randomly decide that my towels haven't been replaced in ten years so it MUST be time for new ones. In a color I don't even like. It's a stupid waste of my time, her money, and extra stress all around when it would be easier to just go to the bank end give me money and tell me to buy what I need when I need it. \n\nBut THAT'S too impersonal and a mortifying sin in her eyes.", "NTA.  \"4X?
