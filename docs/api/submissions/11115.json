We live in separate apartments for a couple of reasons: my son (11) is allergic to his cat and my boyfriend lacks the funds to move out or to help pay for the larger apartment.\n\nSo when my son is with his dad (I divorced from him), my boyfriend comes over and hangs out for a few days. He lives about an hour\u2019s walk away. Yes he walks to my place and says he likes the exercise. When the weather is bad, I\u2019ll rent a car from a local car-sharing service and pick him up. \n\nI don\u2019t stay at his place because I don\u2019t like the cat hair, he has no internet (which I need for work) and it\u2019s very long ride with public transit.  \n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t hang out with my son, so we\u2019ve established \"two separate worlds\" in a way. It\u2019s a respectful but neutral relationship. It\u2019s ok for me because my son is happy to have me to himself on our days together. My boyfriend is welcome anytime but he doesn\u2019t make an effort to be involved with my son, so I never forced it. \n\nYes it\u2019s hard sometimes as a couple, but this is the best arrangement we came up with. \n\nThis is where I might be TA:\nOur finances are very different. I\u2019ve scrimped and saved all my life and I\u2019m able to take care of myself and my son. \nMy boyfriend lives paycheque to paycheque. He has zero savings. \n\nI pay for all the groceries when my boyfriend comes over and I\u2019ve helped him get out of a jam with taxes he owed. My boyfriend owes me about $5000. He\u2019s paying me back as fast he can, but it\u2019s slow going for him. \n\nRecently I rented a cottage for a few nights with my son. My boyfriend says he\u2019ll house-sit my apartment while I\u2019m gone because I have a nicer place. And he asked me to \"keep the fridge stocked up\" for him. I told him he\u2019d welcome to stay over but my finances are too tight and that I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility to take care of him in that way. I told him that in the past I could afford it but my budget is too tight lately because of the debt he owes me of $5000. He didn\u2019t like to be reminded of that debt\u2026\n\nHe says I\u2019m nicklin-and-diming him and being unfair spending money on my son but not spending this small thing of paying for groceries for him while I\u2019m away on vacation. \n\nSo WIBTA to just leave my boyfriend take care of his own food while I\u2019m away on vacation?", "created_utc": 1677560895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dxk2r/wibta_if_i_didnt_have_food_at_home_for_my/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't believe you are holding onto a mooch and asking if you should feel guilty about not stocking up on food for him and letting him stay at your place when there is no reason for him to be house sitting for you.  You will most likely never see the $5000 and that money could have been your emergency money, cash to put into your son's education fund to build interest on.  Instead you gave it to a 50 yr old parasite.
