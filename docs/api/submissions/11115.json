We live in separate apartments for a couple of reasons: my son (11) is allergic to his cat and my boyfriend lacks the funds to move out or to help pay for the larger apartment.\n\nSo when my son is with his dad (I divorced from him), my boyfriend comes over and hangs out for a few days. He lives about an hour\u2019s walk away. Yes he walks to my place and says he likes the exercise. When the weather is bad, I\u2019ll rent a car from a local car-sharing service and pick him up. \n\nI don\u2019t stay at his place because I don\u2019t like the cat hair, he has no internet (which I need for work) and it\u2019s very long ride with public transit.  \n\nMy boyfriend doesn\u2019t hang out with my son, so we\u2019ve established \"two separate worlds\" in a way. It\u2019s a respectful but neutral relationship. It\u2019s ok for me because my son is happy to have me to himself on our days together. My boyfriend is welcome anytime but he doesn\u2019t make an effort to be involved with my son, so I never forced it. \n\nYes it\u2019s hard sometimes as a couple, but this is the best arrangement we came up with. \n\nThis is where I might be TA:\nOur finances are very different. I\u2019ve scrimped and saved all my life and I\u2019m able to take care of myself and my son. \nMy boyfriend lives paycheque to paycheque. He has zero savings. \n\nI pay for all the groceries when my boyfriend comes over and I\u2019ve helped him get out of a jam with taxes he owed. My boyfriend owes me about $5000. He\u2019s paying me back as fast he can, but it\u2019s slow going for him. \n\nRecently I rented a cottage for a few nights with my son. My boyfriend says he\u2019ll house-sit my apartment while I\u2019m gone because I have a nicer place. And he asked me to \"keep the fridge stocked up\" for him. I told him he\u2019d welcome to stay over but my finances are too tight and that I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility to take care of him in that way. I told him that in the past I could afford it but my budget is too tight lately because of the debt he owes me of $5000. He didn\u2019t like to be reminded of that debt\u2026\n\nHe says I\u2019m nicklin-and-diming him and being unfair spending money on my son but not spending this small thing of paying for groceries for him while I\u2019m away on vacation. \n\nSo WIBTA to just leave my boyfriend take care of his own food while I\u2019m away on vacation?", "created_utc": 1677560895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dxk2r/wibta_if_i_didnt_have_food_at_home_for_my/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has no incentive to pay you back,  either.  And he's ACTUALLY OFFENDED when you mention his debt.\n\nIt's almost like he's an escort. You PAY for his company, and he's only there when your kid isn't.\n\nWould you not rather a relationship with a person who takes care of their own finances? Who can maybe take you out for dinner instead of demanding groceries?

Does your apt need to be fed or have someone to make sure it doesn't run around with scissors or accidentally drink bleach? Tell him to stay home and watch his own place. \n\nYour BF is a knob for getting upset at you for spending money on your child. Drop the dead weight hanging around your neck and have fun with your son. Of course, if you dump your BF you will never see the money you loaned him again.

It is not your responsibility to provide for him. You have separate finances, separate homes, and separate life obligations.

The fact that he cited unfairness for you to spend money on your 11 y/o son, who is a CHILD in your legal and financial care, speaks volumes about his immaturity and even learned helplessness. \n\nIt honestly sounds like he is taking advantage of you. I would be wary of someone who is choosing to depend on you financially but uninterested in getting to know your child, especially after 7 years. A good relationship depends on mutual love and respect for both people to grow and benefit from it, but it seems like he has been the only one to benefit from anything here. Please continue to be wise with the money that you have scrimped and saved to care for your son, who actually needs you. Your grown BF can feed himself, which he should be doing anyway, even if he had not invited himself to stay at your larger apartment with internet under the guise of \u201chouse-sitting\u201d.", "Nta\nYou've spoiled him too much and he expects for you to spoil him more.

Keep your finances drum tight and separate. Stevie Wonder sees trouble here\u2026", "YWNBTA \n\nA debt of $5k is not nickel and diming him. That\u2019s a substantial amount of money.

All stocked sir", "NTA - He is a grown man.", "NTA. I cannot fathom why you should pay for his food, if you and your son were home BF would be buying his own food at his apt. He sounds like a user who can't take care of himself and is taking advantage of you. \n\nSorry to say this and I know you have been together for 7 years but this sounds like a very one sided relationship where he takes and you give.

I hope you at least have some paper proof. The man's just parasiting on you.", "NTA - Think it\u2019s time for a new BF!
