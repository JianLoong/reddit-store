He gets a little bit irritated and that is kinda of the end of the issue.\n\nA few days later, we go for a walk again.

We have to live here and I don\u2019t want to get yelled at.\u201d\n\nMy partner gets very mad and says, that I am threatening not to walk the dogs with him anymore, and that I\u2019m being manipulative.

When I'm on a walk, my dog is squatting and pooping with seconds of me noticing. Seems like it would be difficult for the dog to understand where it can poop.", "> It\u2019s grass. No one is planning on eating off of it or anything.\n\nYou've never met my dog.", "I am learning that a lot more people than I thought, are okay with dogs pooping on their lawn. \n\nI just don\u2019t want the pup to poop on the wrong neighbor\u2019s yard and have a long standing issue with a neighbor.", "Picking up poo dont mean all the poo is gone. There will be some left. If it ends up on my kids then the guys in trouble. Its about respect. The bf has no respect and cant handle his dog.", "> \u201cthere\u2019s shit residue\u201c\n\nthat shit was comical, even if there is some residue bugs will have it gone in 2 days, plus the sun and rain.\n\nPeople looking to get uptight over nothing. YTA", "> it is still bad for the lawn\n\nwait until you find out what fertilizer is", "Yes!  To be clear, I would still walk the dogs, just not with him, so instead of a cute family walk, we\u2019d be taking turns. \n\nAnd I had a terrible neighbor situation at my old house.  It was awful.  I never want to live through that again.", "Awww, no.  He\u2019s so great.  \n\nA surprising number of people seem to agree with him.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m worried about!  A neighbor giving us a super hard time.", "I think it's going to depend on where you live. If your neighborhood doesn't have grass on both sides of the sidewalk, then the dogs don't really have a choice. In that situation, I would say it's fine as long as you're keeping the dog on the edge of the yard. In OP's neighborhood, where there is grass on both sides, I agree you should go with the option that's not somebody's yard. I've lived in both situations, and most people seem to follow these unwritten rules when they walk their pets.", "Then you do what you gotta do, which might mean the dog poops on the tree lawn or, if you live in a suburban hellhole with no sidewalks, wherever you happen to be. And, of course, you pick it up.", "> I've never lived anywhere where a dog pooping on someone's lawn in rude.\n\nDo you *walk* on people's lawns? \n\nI would consider it rude for somebody to walk in my yard except in some unusual circumstances, like if they had to move out of the way to let a person in a wheelchair pass by.\n\nIf I don't want humans walking in my yard, why would I want their dogs walking in my yard? And if I don't want their dogs walking in my yard, it stands to reason that I also don't want their dogs (or the humans) pooping in my yard.\n\n> Also seems what do you do if your dog needs to poop and it's not on the 'appropriate ' grass.\n\nTeach your dog to walk on the same side as the hand holding the leash. Hold the leash on the side away from the lawn.\n\nAlternatively, train the dog to only poop on cement or asphalt. You trained the dog to only poop outside the house, right?", "Any neighbor who is mad for the dog pooping after he picks it up sucks and is going to find something to bitch about anyways. Dogs go outside, as long as it\u2019s being picked up, what\u2019s the issue?", "It is also important to note whether the dog does his business on the edge of the lawn or much farther in. I feel if it is within a foot of the edge then okay. But if you're letting the dog walk to the middle of the lawn to poop then yes, you're TA.\n\nEdited to add that it sounds like the dog is pooping in the SAME neighbor's lawn each time; that is also a problem. The neighbor's lawn is not the dog's personal poop area.", "It probably already is.  Or a fantasy football team name", "Sure they do. Your dog can poop on your lawn. There is no reason for you to let a dog poop on a neighbor's lawn. It is a great way to spread disease. If you don't want your dog's poop on your lawn why would I want it on mine?", "> It is a great way to spread disease.\n\nI think this might be a bit dramatic.", "Hi, have you met a dog? They can take a gigantic dump in their own yard, immediately go for a walk, and 9 times out of 10 they will decorate someone\u2019s lawn again. There\u2019s nothing you can do but pick it up.", "most leashes are around 6 feet, so the lawns are only 10 feet?", "Just about.  Since we are in a new neighborhood, the yard are small.  I would estimate that about half of the front lawns are about half the length of the driveway.  \n\nThe builders are really trying to cram in as many houses as they can, so, the front yards are small.", "so a yard so small they are basically useless anyways. FYI most people who see a dog shit in their lawn wait to see if you pick it up and stop caring the second you do."]}
