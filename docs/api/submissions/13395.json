I have a pretty static lifestyle that includes my work, sports cars, my house and nightlife.\n\nMy aunt (my mom's sister - 50F) and her husband (essentially my uncle - 54M) sent their only son off to college somewhere near the city I live in. They wanted to go see their son and asked me if they could stay over a couple of days and see me as well on their way. My mom also insisted I say yes, and so I did.\n\nThey stayed with me for a week on their way to their son's city, and 9 days on the way back. While they were with me, I got up around 5.30 in the morning, did my workout routine, and left home at 7. I came back around 11 like I always do.\n\nMy aunt said I could have managed everything much better, and that there was nothing in the fridge when they came to my house. I told them they could order anything they wanted on my account, and there was only fuit and water because that's all I need when I'm home.\n\nShe also complained that I spent some nights away, which could be avoided but I'm just used to my routine. (Meaning girls I spend time with sometimes - I'm bi with a leaning towards women, that's why). My aunt also said I could at least spend one meal with them, which I did on the weekend but other than that I've got work. \n\nAfter I explained everything, my aunt said I was being a rude host and that she wanted to see her niece in a much better condition. She even got teary eyed for God's sake. I said I can of course strive to be better but this is how my life is and she came knowing this.\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me at all since she went back other than a text saying thank you. My mom says I need to get my life together and apologise to my aunt. Was I an AH?\n\nEdit: they were initially supposed to stay for 2 days each time, and they asked to extend the visit every night.

That's a lot of time spent at your place when it was supposed to be a stopover while being on the road ...\n\nNTA", "NTA - they had a free place to stay for NINE DAYS. No \u201cguest\u201d should stay for that long. If they don\u2019t like it tell them to get a hotel next time.", "Info: if their son stays in a different city why did they stay 2 weeks with you?", "NTA. You didn't invite them. They were forced upon you. You did them a favor by letting them stay in your place instead of paying for a hotel. I would refuse any further visits and let them find their own accommodation", "NTA!!\n\nThey were there for a combined 14 days!!! That\u2019s outrageous. You were a gracious host just allowing them to stay that long. \n\nA drive by visit with extended family is 2 days MAX. Spend an afternoon together, go out for dinner one night, say goodbyes and everyone moves on with their lives. \n\nAlso kudos for handling their poor reactions with grace and calm. \n\nYou\u2019re fine!", "NTA\n\nMom, my  life is together. I was busy living it. Never will I ever stop living it for an uninvited guest. Sorry, but I refuse to be imposed on. She invited herself, she got a clean bed. End of story.", "So they invited themselves to stay at your house and then complained you weren't a good host.  They're the AH, not you!  NTA.", "ESH - I think that this could have been fixed with some communication before hand. Like maybe saying you are welcome to stay but I have a very busy schedule and I won't be seeing you most days. Also because I'm very busy I mostly eat out and don't have anything in the fridge, so maybe pick up some essentials or you are welcome to get food under my account.\n\nThey suck because if I read this correctly they stayed over 2 weeks with you. That is overstaying their welcome if they are just \"stopping by\" on their way to see their son. Did they tell you before hand it would be that long? Also, you didn't reach out and invite them to stay, so it's unreasonable that they are asking for so much of your time.", "ESH. Sounds like you all assumed different things about the nature of their stay without actually talking to each other.", "NTA  If they were going to be there a couple of days on a weekend, and let you know exactly when in advance, expecting to spend some time with you would be reasonable.  They asked to stay a couple of days, and ended up there for 16 days.  That is not a reasonable amount of time to visit someone who works full time, particularly without advance warning.", "NTA. How did a couple days turn into 16 days?? If you were so inhospitable, why did they stay so long?", "NTA - you moved away for a reason. They could\u2019ve gotten a hotel too.", "NTA because they are adults who were staying for an extended period of time. They should realize that you are a working person with your own life and can't put everything on hold for two weeks.\n\nWhen people visit for two weeks - especially when they aren't close friends or family - you generally don't accompany them every day. They are expected to figure out what they want to do. This is true for friends and close family as well but in general you might actually want to spend more time with them when they visit.\n\nThat said, I do think there could be better communication. While you certainly shouldn't feel an obligation to prepare meals for them, it might be nice to have some staples around they might eat especially for breakfast. I don't know what that would be but it might include milk, coffee, tea, bread (or breakfast pastries) and cereal. \n\nThe irony is that guests are generally expected to provide a hostess gift AND take their host out for dinner at a nice place.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly didn't want to spend time with them and you showed it (who goes hooking up with some girls when you have guests over - you clearly could have canceled the hook ups for the two seperate weeks they were over, thats just so rude). \n\nYou are an adult. If you don't want guests, tell them no and live with your moms disappointment. But saying yes and then being a bad host on purpose (and yes, thats what you did, you wanted them to know they are not welcomed and you don't care about them) is just passiv aggressiv behaviour. Its not your aunts and uncles fault you were too much of a coward to tell them and your mom no. I go with your mom here, get your life together ffs. \n\nBut that you are surprised your aunt has no interest in speaking to you anymore after you made clear you don't care about her is kinda funny, lol.", "Slight YTA,\n\nYou agreed to host. Then you should host. Either that or let them know it is just a place to crash on their way to and from son.\n\nBut as it stands you knew they wanted to visit you and agreed with this. So making a little bit of time for them to share some meals, spend an evening, at the verry least have some food in you house would be wanted", "NTA\n\nYou spared them the massive expense of staying at hotel and effectively let them make your home their own. You offered to foot the bill for their food, and you gave time for an obligatory dinner out with them. They stayed an inordinate amount of time and had the audacity to bitch that you were an insufficient hostess. \n\nI can\u2019t see where you were in the wrong here at all, and I also have to wonder if the same excessive expectations would have been put onto you if you were a nephew instead of a niece.\n\nYou were overly generous and absolutely NTA.", "NTA, you live your life the way you want it. They thought you were gonna put on a performance as \"hostess\" for them. They realized you, within your right, said I'm not doing that. Oh well. At least they won't be thinking to stay with you for over a week again.", "Absolutely NTA. Audacity of some people is something else. I mean, I live in east and no one would complain like that while sitting on their ass in someone's home.  Also, the situation can feel similar since my cousin is studying in our city, so his parents stay here to visit him. Has someone ever complained about things that your aunt mentioned? Oh lord NO (they even help a little with cleaning, some maintenance stuff, cooking and grocery shopping - horror :o).", "NTA. Sounds like you have your life completely together. Aunt and uncle, however sound like a couple of needy handfuls. \"...if they could stay over a couple of days...\" and then stay >2 weeks? WTF?", "Tell them they\u2019re acting pretty ungrateful for free accommodations. Why couldn\u2019t they go grocery shopping? Why couldn\u2019t she make meals? 14 days is way to long to host anyone.", "Nta\nHonestly what they mean? Op in a much better condition? get Op life together?  So far I read op have her life together in a good condition. Op have routine, a house to life and quiet happy with her lifestyle. Both op mom and auntie is just looking for drama.", "YTA. \n\nSure, they overstayed. But you AGREED to host them and didn't communicate with them any need for boundaries or a limit on their stay. From their POV, they were guests and you were a terrible host. \n\nIf you agree to host, you agree to *being a host.* if you don't want to be a host, use your big girl words and tell them they can't stay with you.", "INFO: Did you know how long they planned on staying? Did you tell them beforehand that you were busy and wouldn\u2019t be around much? Did they have easy access to the card or whatever you offered so they could order supplies from your account, or would it have been confusing/difficult?\n\nGenuinely asking. This one has me scratching my head a bit.", "Nah. You could and should have made some plans with them and had some basics in the house. It\u2019s just a kind thing to do.  You don\u2019t have to rearrange your life for them though.", "INFO: did you know in advance that they were planning to stay for such a long time? Did you have any communication about expectations or boundaries before they arrived?", "ESH\n\nThey stayed quite a long time and are adults capable of taking care of their basic needs. They also expressed an interest in spending time with you and that was your opportunity to say you wouldn\u2019t be available except for a few meals the entire time. I would be shocked if I was staying at someone\u2019s house and they didn\u2019t communicate that they would be unavailable 22 hours each day including sleeping time.", "Sixteen days is a pretty major visit...especially when you're not invited! They asked if they could crash for a couple of days-a couple is 2. They should have stopped by the grocery when they came back for Round 2 instead of expecting you to cater to them. Be grateful for the silence/distance. \n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nThey made it clear their intent was to not just see their son but to see *you.* Not only did you leave them with little to eat or drink (They could order things but...that's an extra hassle for no reason) you were barely, if ever, around to hang out with them.\n\nI understand you're used to your routine and such but you really played this whole thing the wrong way.", "INFO: Was there agreement in advance on when they would be staying, or did they ask to stay over 'a couple of days' and then stay for what sounds like \\~16? Because you're TA either way for agreeing to host them and then not taking even minimal steps to be a good host, but if they crashed for that long when you hadn't been expecting it, everyone sucks.", "Kinda YTA. It sounds like they came to visit you, not just looking for a place to crash. I think you needed to clarify that before. You basically just ignored them for 2 weeks. I\u2019m sure they have more interesting things to do with their lives than sit in someone else\u2019s house.", "I don't understand all the N T A. I think this is much more an ESH situation. They stayed too long and some of their complaints are a bit ridiculous but I can't imagine having guests and not organizing and planning. Asking how long they were coming for and even asking for a much shorter stay since I do think they overstayed. But I would have then made plans to ensure they had food and planned to spend my evenings or whatever free time with them. I couldn't imagine going to a hookup if a family member came to town and was visiting me.\n\nEdit: words", "When you agree to host family at your place it\u2019s a good idea to actually play the host.  They were coming to see you and you were MIA.  That\u2019s rude.", "ESH. Them for staying a ridiculously long time (9 days? Yikes) and you for not being a more gracious host and/or laying out the ground rules for their stay ahead of time.", "ESH, regardless of your mom insisting, you said yes to host them.\n\nIt sounds like seeing you was a part of what they were wanting by staying, not just a place to crash, and maybe its a cultural thing but holy cow only having fruit and water in the house when I know have have guests coming is just wild.", "ESH\n\n\nYes, they essentially invited themselves over. Yes, they have no business interfering with your life. Yes, they shouldn't be mucking up your schedule. And yes, you housed them for free for a long period of time.\n\n\nBut you agreed to host them. Begrudgingly and unwillingly, sure. But you still agreed to do it. You could have done it better.\n\nI'm introverted AF and hate having people over, but when they ARE over, I make sure to treat them well.", "They wanted more than a free place to stay. Anyone who stays that long with a single person wants to hang out. You yourself say you have a \u201cpretty static\u201d lifestyle. I get that you are enjoying the life you\u2019ve built for yourself. But you really couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything special with or for them?  Meanwhile your Aunt & Uncle had expectations they didn\u2019t talk through with you. It seems like poor communication is a family thing. ESH", "YTA for not finding time to eat one meal with your family.  I don\u2019t understand all the comments here, it\u2019s basic decency to visit with a guest even if unwanted.", "While I think you could have communicated that you didn't usually keep food at home before they arrived, I definitely don't think you're an AH.\n\nThe part that really gets to me is that your aunt and mum told you that you need to get your life together all because you didn't give in to their every whim. \nPeople have stuff to do, and unless they tell me otherwise I could never expect somebody to not work or have a life just because I'm staying in their home for a week or more at a time. \n\nNTA", "partying and eating like shit will probably catch up with you but whatever that's neither here nor there", "Idk If it's a cultural thing but I cant think of ever having family over and not trying to spend at least some quality time with them. Especially if I am far away from my family and live on my own. Sounds like you dont really care for your family members, only yourself and the life you've built. Which is okay if that's who you want to be.", "ESA. Next time set a time max on visits. 7 and 9 days would never fly for me. \nStock your kitchen appropriately. Plan some meals, and activities. Or don't host.", "ESH ask your mom how your life isn\u2019t together? Fucking ridiculous. Although I do agree you are a bit in the wrong. You did agree to host, the lest you could have done was gotten a couple groceries for them. That\u2019s what good hosts do if they know they won\u2019t be home. Don\u2019t be so simple minded next time.", "So your 'guests' were obviously AHs. They stayed far too long (did you agree to 9 days and 1 week? seriously?). People don't get to force-invite themselves, even family. They also don't get to tell people not to do some normal things (like work, date, etc.).\n\nHowever, you need to learn to say no and set boundaries. If you said yes to 2 days, that's how long they stay, and, yes, during that time you would host at least a little bit. That does mean not scheduling staying over at a date's the nights they stay--AGAIN, when they stay within the invited guest/3-day max rules. Uninvited guests for weeks? Sure, that sucks.\n\nBut I've had much more gracious interactions with AirBnB hosts. You weren't just going about your normal life, you sound actively hostile. If you were going to be that way, you needed to say no in advance.\n\nSo ESH but them more.", "You didn\u2019t want them there. You treated them that way. They didn\u2019t like being treated that way. \n\nESH", "YTA you agreed to host them and then\u2026didn\u2019t. It\u2019s rude. People can say \u201coh I don\u2019t have to do shit for anyone else and how dare they want to stay at my place\u201d and while no, cops won\u2019t come arrest you for it, if you have family coming to stay - have basic food items available for them to eat, make some time to spend with them, and don\u2019t act like they are a major inconvenience. Note: I say \u201csome\u201d time. They shouldn\u2019t expect you to spend every waking minute with them, but surely you could have managed more than one dinner. If you can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s fine. But the solution is to say no, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t host you for that time. I\u2019m simply too busy.", "YTA. Passive-agressive much? You couldn't even provide common courtesy. I suspect you would have been more accomodating to a lost puppy that wandered in through the back door. If you disliked them that much you should have denied their request.", "YTA.  Yup, yes, you were.   They are family, and it's your home, not a hotel.  I'm sure they could have gone to a hotel, but maybe the point was to stay with you and hang around you?  You didn't make an ounce of time for them in the name of \"your routine\" which really just means you couldn't be bothered to alter it for them.  like your aunt does not matter to you at all.  Maybe she doesn't, but I still think there is a certain level of decorum you should uphold toward your mom's sister.   Some respect maybe?   From your post, you honestly just sound very cold and self-centred, and a smidge obnoxious.  It's not a good look.   Nobody cares how much money you make, it's your character that will leave an impression.", "NTA\n\nThis would be good for the entitled people sub. What kind of people invite themselves to stay in someone's home and then expect to be entertained their entire stay? The entitled.", "NTA: they said a couple of days and they stayed for weeks. Sounds like they were trying to freeload an entire vacation off you and were annoyed you provided what they asked for instead of much more.", "NTA\n\nThey weren't your guests.  They were borders assigned to you by your mother.\n\nIf you had invited them out of a desire to spend time with them, you probably would have planned dinners and outings.\n\nBut, they wanted to awkwardly stay at your house way too long for people just going to see their son that, from what it sounds, is in a different city altogether.\n\nThe whole reason for their stay is weird.", "NTA\n\n> My mom says I need to get my life together and apologise to my aunt. \n\nOh hell no! I was leaning towards E-S-H, but this single comment very clearly makes you a NTA. Your life seems very much together. And imposing on you a week and then an extra week on top just screams that the goal of this was to set you on the straight and narrow well behaved box.\n\nFuck them.", "NTA", "NTA- you were letting them share your personal space, you are not a hotel nor was a request made that you make yourself more available before their extended stays.\n\nEditing to say that OP only said yes AFTER their mother insisted. If any of the other adults had mentioned that more interaction besides a place to stay, OP might have moved things around - obviously speculation. OP aunt and uncle stayed nearly DOUBLE what most (I think) would consider the max of a \"couple\" of days, and after that first 7 day stretch it would be a major imposition.\n\nA couple of days would, FOR ME, mean 4 days max and after 4 anything I had planned or rearranged for them would run dry and I would be back to my normal routine. Like, I have someone over for a board game weekend often but never for more than 4 days because we all have things to get back to - and my husband works halfway during it too.", "That's a long time for people you don't know to be staying with you. I'm going to have to say NTA because he stays so long with someone they don't know well.", "If they felt so neglected by you why did they stay so long?", "Gee, why doesn't the hotel manager want to hang out with us? That's how they're using your place, a hotel to make their visits to their son convenient. NTA", "I feel like you are a saint for letting them stay so long. NTA", "Nta. I'm a 31 year old man. If someone wants to come visit they can, but they're not staying at my house. They are grown ups who can get a hotel.  This sounds like some overly polite British shit", "How did a few days turn in two and a half weeks? NTA. And stop listening to your mom..", "NTA. You were strong-armed into having family who you live distant from stay with you for over TWO WEEKS for free, on their way somewhere else! They should not have expected you to change your lifestyle or entertain them for that long. They are adults and can feed themselves, explore a new city on their own, and realize that you did them a massive favor.

I also told them they could order anything they wanted that very first night, and all they needed was to make a call and everything would be handled.", "Sounds like she does have her life together. Very well might I add. It is her Family that NEEDED a place to stay (why for weeks???) so maybe they should get their life together and figure out how to feed and house themselves for the duration of their stay. They are USING you, your money and your home and then are showing no appreciation at all. I'm sure if they asked ahead of time for a \"Tuesday night dinner out together\" you could accommodate, but to expect you to drop you life and entertain them while THEY decided to stay without even being invited... ridiculous!", "Which ones?", "This is it. Go places where you are invited and listen to whatever they tell you.", "I learned this real fast when I lived abroad. I was always happy to have people visit me, but I was not going to take off work, and they got maybe half my weekdays and my weekends.

My mom still lets her ex's elderly parents crash in her home, even though we've all nearly moved out. They take over her home with barely a week's notice. I'm proud she's grown a backbone over the years and stopped giving up her bed (!!). OP's auntie sounds like she was treated some way and expected to harvest some royal karma from her niece and was disappointed instead. Not OP's fault. If they had a good relationship, dinner would have been nice.

I'm not gonna uproot my schedule for two whole weeks of visitors, and I couldn't imagine my family asking me to.

It isn't that hard for me to put it on pause for a week or so while having family in town.", "I mean\u2026 OP allowed them to stay. I believe if you allow someone to stay, you provide them with some basic necessities. Place to sleep, towel and washcloth and a few staples for food.

That's pretty shitty. YTA imo", "I agree with you, but considering the aunt and uncle had originally planned to stay for a \u201ccouple of days\u201d but subsequently decided to extend their stay, they might have thought that by staying longer they\u2019d have more chances to spend time with OP. My point is, I don\u2019t think we should be so quick to label the aunt and uncle as inconsiderate for extending their stay; at most, they might be at fault for not communicating their expectations.", "Completely agree with you that the length of their stay was unwarranted, but like I said in response to a similar comment, the aunt and uncle might have subsequently decided to extend their stay out of hopes they\u2019d get more chances to spend time with OP (especially considering they\u2019d originally only planned to stay for a couple of days). If that\u2019s the case, they\u2019re at fault for not communicating their expectations, but if OP had been close to her aunt and uncle before their visit, she\u2019s an AH for doing nothing to make her family members feel welcome during a visit she consented to. That last detail is something most of the N T A votes conveniently overlook. She easily could\u2019ve said no\u2014explained she\u2019s too busy, etc.\u2014but once she agreed to let family members (who sound like they\u2019d expected to spend time with her during their stay) stay at her apartment, she had a duty to do the bare minimum to make them feel welcome. Like I said, I\u2019m not saying she had to bend over backwards and temporarily alter her entire lifestyle, but she could\u2019ve communicated her schedule and tried to at least eat more than one meal with them.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think whether OP is an AH hinges on her prior relationship with her aunt and uncle, and maybe even with her mother (assuming OP\u2019s aunt is her mother\u2019s sister). I\u2019m not close with my extended family because they live far away but I\u2019m generally close with my parents, and if my mom\u2019s sister wanted to stay with me for a couple of days, I\u2019d make sure she felt comfortable by ensuring there was at least food in my apartment for her to eat. And if I hadn\u2019t done that and my aunt had subsequently decided to stay for longer than she\u2019d originally planned, I\u2019d take the hint that she expected something to change, or at least communicate with her. The fact that OP just straight up ignored her aunt and uncle makes me want to label her the AH here, but again, we need more INFO.", "They didn\u2019t complain she wasn\u2019t \u201centertaining\u201d them. They complained she didn\u2019t do the bare minimum for family members whom\u2014if OP indeed had a good relationship with them and had reason to know they were staying with her to spend time with her\u2014she\u2019d agreed to host. It doesn\u2019t take much to have things in the fridge for them to eat. That shows a lack of consideration on OP\u2019s part. Again, this is all assuming that OP\u2019s relationship with her aunt and uncle was of a certain nature, which we can\u2019t ascertain from her post.\n\nMoreover, OP rubbed me the wrong way when she made it seem her aunt was being ridiculous for getting \u201cteary-eyed.\u201d It\u2019s a perfectly valid reaction to be upset that a family member whom you love and had expected to spend time with has refused to do absolutely anything to accommodate you.", "Asking if you can stay is still, by definition, inviting yourself. Just so you know. It's considered rude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd no, just showing up is just showing up. That's showing up WITHOUT an invitation (self-initiated or otherwise). It's ruder than inviting yourself. Which is still rude.", "They claimed that they were only going to spend a couple of days there just for a quick visit and they got what they wanted since op spent dinner with them, but without warning they turned those couple of days into a full blown two week vacation. Op shouldn\u2019t stop living her life and routine because of their decision. Op was beyond generous letting them stay longer and made no promises to do anything with them after those couple of days.", "We keep our guest suite up to date with the latest phone chargers as well. Both my husband and I are introverts and don't do well with strangers or making small talk, but we can get out of our comfort zone for a week or so. We won't die from it!", "No i don\u2019t necessarily think she needs to take time off work, rememver they were only supposed to stay for 2 days each time.  It\u2019s odd to host people and then not come home after work until bedtime or not come home at all and go on dates or stay with other people when your family came specifically to see you. \n\nAnd while you don\u2019t know anyone who can afford to take time off work, if you had people in your life whose personal lives revolve around nightlife and sports cars, as OP mentioned, then it probably wouldn\u2019t be an issue.  If it is, the polite thing to do is to make that clear and also make an effort to spend *some* time with them instead of ignoring them (her words!)\n\nHer family ended up being there for 2 weeks and while she made time for her dates, friends and hobbies, she only had dinner with them once?  That\u2019s just not normal behavior.  It\u2019s a great way to make people feel unwelcome in your home if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for.", "Okay but in the post it was noted before the visit they wanted to visit so this sound like it was always meant to be the second and op just didn't clock that. Either way this entire situation could have been handled better with some actual communication.", "OP obviously didn't think so but thats her own fault when they plainly expressed they wanted to see her. She just chose to ignore them. OP even admits this when she even said they asked to see her", "Her mother is who insisted, but she was rude to her aunt and uncle. She took out her anger at her mother (and herself for caving) on her aunt and uncle. It's plain to see she passive-aggressively let them know they don't matter rather than telling her mother and them, \"No.\" Caving was ***her choice***, don't punish others for your own mistake and cowardice.", "Technically, my nana and grandpa. But it's less her \"visiting the grandkids\" (all in their 30s without notice) which is what she convinced my mom. It's clearly more for nana to get a perm and see her doctors. My dad's side is deeply narcissistic...", "My read of the situation is, they asked if they could stay \"a couple days on the way to visit their son\" thinking, they get to make travel easier and see the niece, win-win\n\nOP didn't really want to host when her life is busy and made noises to that effect to either the aunt or the Mom and the Mom proceeded to pressure her to say yes, probably stressing that it was only 2 days, it's her aunt and uncle so they wouldn't be a big imposition and that she would be doing them a big favor.\n\nWhich gives OP the impression they know she'll be busy and are only after a place to crash. OP is also maybe a little ticked off at having her arm twisted and extra unwilling to rearrange her schedule.\n\nAunt and uncle arrive maybe having been given the impression by Mom that OP is gonna hang out with them.\n\nDisappointment ensue.", "Again, I guess its a cultural thing cause if a friend of mine called me up and asked if they could crash at my place while they were in town for a concert or something, I would not consider that rude at all or them inviting themselves.", "I said ESH for a reason", "I agree about it being irrelevant. I invite family to visit us, but we live in a big city and often are used as a mini-vacation. Either is fine with us. It is stressful to host, but family/friends are really important to us.\n\nThat being said, if someone asks to stay with us for a week and i got a big project coming up at work, I'd let them know that my time is limited. Still, I'd give them what time i had.", "I often wonder this too. Reddit seems very against the concept of shared responsibilities. The aunt and technical uncle (lol)'s side of the street is being gracious guests -- offering to buy groceries, pay for a meal or make a meal, hostess gift, something like that. The OP's side of the street was clearing her schedule for one or two evenings expressly to spend time with them, or at least *asking* what they wanted to do while they were in town, and yeah, getting like a few things that might be good for guests. I mean, if you're not going to stock the fridge further than some fruit, then are you also like not going give them sheets or towels? Similarly, you being unable to say no and express boundaries doesn't make other people automatic assholes for taking advantage of it. Bite the bullet, say \"I can host for X days and then I will really need the place back to myself. Hope that works.\"", "You are right about the communication, and with the hindsight it would indeed have been better if OP clearly communicated what can and what cannot be expected from her (you can stay for sure but I am pretty busy at work now and have some events planned so I will not be able to be with you much, but I'd definitely manage to have one dinner with you. I would also like to warn you that I do not cook at home and don't have many groceries but if you tell me what you like I'd buy some breakfast stuff and otherwise please feel free to order on my dime).\n\nHowever, even if she didn't, the guests were awfully rude to lecture her for not having/ doing what they wanted. And this is JUST.NOT.DONE.A gracious guest would say something like \"Oh, do not worry, we are happy we can stay at your place, we are sorry that it fell on a busy time for you. We are looking forward to that dinner with you - please tell us what your favorite restaurant is and let us invite you out. It would be nice if you had some milk and breakfast cereals but don't worry about the rest - we will of course take care of this, and let us know if we can buy something for you/cook a meal for you).\n\nWhat they did was a sure path to never be invited again - next time OP will probably put her foot down with her mom. And she does not seem to worry that those boors will possibly go NC with her.", "OK, even assuming they actually wanted to SEE OP, would it not be counterproductive if they did not let HER invite them, or at least checked with her whether their visit is convenient to her?\n\nI mean, to invite myself in a time that is convenient to ME, and then expect my host to bend over backwards does not seem precisely to be the sign of a considerate guest.", "I think this is perhaps the heart of where we differ.  I'd instead say, OP obviously didn't think so, *and that's what matters, since its OP's home*.", "Yeah, that feels less like \"we'll always be family\" and more like just not wanting to pay for a hotel room.", "> There\u2019s no evidence in the post that OP didn\u2019t know how long they were staying.\n\nIn the post, the OP writes that they asked if they could stay for a couple of days. A \u201ccouple of days\u201d usually means 2, maybe 3 max. But they stayed for more than a couple of WEEKS.", "She didn\u2019t need to say no because she didn\u2019t conceive they expected to be entertained for weeks, and she did set a good boundary, \u201cYou can come. I will eat with you on weekends.
