Things like starting a family, etc. this matter should concern directly only the person himself. Only you can decide when you do it, and no one else. Even if you have such a family, it does not change the essence that you should have personal boundaries.", "Um.... NTA. It's frankly none of their business.", "NTA Obviously you, the Dr, and maybe your partner will be the first to know. As for all others, it's not their business.", "NTA.\n\nYour timeline is literally nobody else\u2019s business. Not your aunts, not your fathers, not the neighbor or the postal worker.

They are playing the comparison game with an imaginary timeline they think you need to accomplish and that\u2019s BS.", "Definitely not the asshole imo", "NTA and your aunt isn't who you should be listening to with her teen pregnancy. People should have kids when they're ready both mentally and financially. It's a huge undertaking, not an accomplishment.", "NTA. Having children is such a personal thing, pressure like that is outdated, invasive and obnoxious. And completely unnecessary. \n\n\nDo they have so little going on in their lives that they need to compare you to your cousins just to have a conversation at all?

You're the one that will need to walk around with extra weight from the baby, your back is going to hurt, you don't get to eat some of your favorite food, you have to do all the check ups, the list goes on...for months!

It wastes your youth and financially doesn't make sense.", "NTA, believe me this is a burden women all over the world of every culture have to endure. For many years I was constantly told I should be settling down. Like I should just accept any guy that\u2019s interested because after the age of 25 you become untouchable or something?! I met my husband at nearly 29 and he is 6 years older than me but we had both been waiting for the right one and we knew very quickly we had found it. I am so glad I waited (and turned down two proposals). Of course immediately then I start getting asked why I\u2019m not pregnant yet, when I\u2019m planning to etc. people who barely know you feel they have the right to ask you questions about life changing decisions about your personal life which is crazy! I have never been very maternal naturally but we did try on the agreement my husband would be a sahd and I would return to work which all made sense as I earned significantly more anyway. We miscarried a few times and then got very ill and the choice was taken away. Honestly we are very happy to not have children, we have fulfilling lives and love each other and are happy and we always agreed that if we did feel like we had missed out then would look at helping by fostering when we were a big older (thinking 50+ sort of age) because so many children need stable placements with people who care. In my early 40\u2019s I still get comments about how I am close to it being too late by people who hardly know me! How anyone thinks these questions or comments are appropriate is beyond me. This kind of pressure is so wrong. \nYou have so much life ahead of you, take your time and do it right. Never compare your journey with someone else\u2019s because no two are the same. You makes your own choices and your father should respect that freedom.", "Well if this was the only issue than it was an action that would make you an A.\n\nBut guessing there was a lot more happening...

At the same time, you\u2019re 24 and starting a life and your family clearly cares about you. It doesn\u2019t make sense to threaten cutting off a loving, if nosy/pushy family. \n\nI think if everyone can just put their guns down, sit calmly at a table, and each apologize, you\u2019ll all be much happier.", "ESH.

Unless of course, I\u2019m missing something", "ESH from what you've written. It's always annoying when people assume your path in life, which from this seems to be a case of \"You woman so you breed\". This makes the family assholes. You are being an asshole for your classic, immature child response of telling your family they're never gonna hear from you again because they annoyed you.\n\nAlso, just a bit of INFO request. What exactly are you doing with your life? From this, it seems you are living at home at 24 with no job or relationship. If so, then this might just be your family concerned that you aren't doing anything with your life rather than an attempt to make you breed.", "Congratulations on being the captain of your own destiny,  I bet there are things your aunt and dad didn't get to do because they lost their childhood to parenthood. I'm glad that you and your brother are living your own lives, on your own terms. Dont listen to their propaganda - at the heart of it is envy. NTA.", "YTA, that was harsh.

Especially women. It's not just a question, it's a command. Not saying all non Hispanic families are the opposite, also mot saying all Hispanic families act like this. But I do see it being more culturally normalised, especially in older generations.", "you\u2019re absolutely right, but from my experience it\u2019s mostly a hispanic thing (that again, i am aware of.)", "I\u2019m 33 in Asia and people think I\u2019m selfish for being unmarried and childish.

And if that is the case then i can understand that they react that way.\n\nI would expect that you already had other issues or that they have been warned not to bring this up numerous times before. If not, it would be fair to give  warning first.. like walking out of the conversation if they start comparing you with your cousin. Telling them that thinking youn have to be maried  and have kids at 25 is very old fashioned. if they do it again, go LC for a month. \n\nIn a way give them the possibility to understand what they are doing and change, before you cut all contact.", "Oh I know Hispanic familes are mad for kids, I was just pointing out that in most cultures people push for their kids to give them grand babies.", "exactly and i\u2019m not gonna have a baby with a random either", "huh? i never said hispanic culture was better than anyone else\u2019s culture lmao. i just said \u201cfrom my experience it\u2019s a hispanic thing\u201d idk where any of this extra stuff came from", "You're a special kind of stupid huh?", "Yeah your parents are most likely trying to get you to breed, which is very AH of them.

I'm not a native English speaker so I may be wrong when writing it down.\n\nI meant the guy called you out as asshole, and I think it was unjustified.

And I don't think you are an asshole to say that in your post. \\^\\^\n\nAlso, although you actually overracted a bit, and I think both sides said bad things in the heat of thing.

I hope it will go well for you.", "i\u2019m not going to lie the more arguments that get instigated the more it makes me want to leave. i want my peace i\u2019m just not ready to do it. i do help with bills and such when asked and i give rent, but honestly i think it\u2019s time to go my own way soon.", "I have to agree. From what you've said, you're not happy there, and you've at least got a stable job.
