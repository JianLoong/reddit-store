As there are all kinds of dietary restrictions in the family, I asked ahead of time if anyone had discovered any new allergies or intolerances so that I could put together a Christmas menu that everyone would like and that there would be something for everyone to eat. Everything 'normal', so I've already done the shopping for the ingredients I'll need.\n\nMy sister Sarah asked yesterday if she could take her brother-in-law (Ben, 23M) for Christmas as his parents didn't want him there this year (Ben lives with his parents). I said yes and texted him his dietary preferences/restrictions. It turns out that Ben is an extremely picky eater who has an aversion to any type of seasoning other than salt. I was really shocked, I (and my family) love spices and seasoning and the idea of using just salt in food appalls me, but I said I could make him pasta, chicken and mashed potatoes with just salt (some of the very few items what he eats). Ben said it wouldn't work as there would be a table full of spices and that he can't even stand the smell and that I should just make the food with salt. I did not answer him.\n\nI called Sarah and said it wouldn't work if Ben wanted to change the whole menu and just... salt. That either he ate his food (chicken, mash and pasta) and left the others alone or he better not come. She agreed and said she would talk to her husband (Tom).\n\nToday, Tom, Ben's brother, complained in the family group that we were mean for not accommodating Ben's dietary restriction and excluding him at Christmas. Until that moment, the family didn't know what it was and when they found out they started laughing at Tom and Ben's \"childish taste\" and that \"no one wanted to eat boring food without seasoning\". Tom called all of us and especially me AH and said he wouldn't come to Christmas with us if we excluded Ben.\n\nI lost my temper and told Tom that I wasn't going to ruin the whole family's Christmas due to his brother being a picky eater who can't stand spices, that his brother has no special condition (food restriction) and was just a spoiled adult who eats 5 foods.\n\nTom said I was AH and left the group. The family agrees with me, but Sarah is sad that Tom doesn't want to go to the family Christmas.\n\nBefore anyone asks: no, Ben doesn't have any restrictions/allergy/ARFID or dietary issues. He just doesn't like/has no interest/has never tried certain foods/spices.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671235459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znt3ov/aita_for_refusing_to_make_only_no_seasoning_food/", "score": 1579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have several eating problems and I hate it when someone says it's childish taste or they try to convince me to change my limitations, but he makes the mistake when he expects other people to accommodate him. What you are doing is already more than expected.", "NTA. That was a perfectly reasonable compromise to give him his own separate food and he really has no right to dictate that everyone else does without some extra flavour just because he can only stand salt.

You did your part by offering him an alternative meal with his preferences. I admire Tom for standing up for his brother but I think he should realize the entitlement of requesting EVERYONE's Christmas meal to be downgraded to rudimentary tastes because he doesn't like the smell of food in your house. If it was my brother complaining about the food at MY in-laws, I would have told him to shut up and eat lol.", "NTA. But if Tom has sensory issues eg taste then I think making fun of his was being rude and arseholeish.

That's not how it works. You were willing to make special spice free dishes for him, but he is way out of line. \n\nIf he doesn't like the smell of spices in other people's food, he can put Vicks under his nose so that he can't smell it, eat out in the car, or stay home.\n\nThe sense of entitlement is unreal!", "NTA. Ben chooses to eat that way. If he doesn\u2019t like what is offered, and isn\u2019t ok with the compromise offered, then he shouldn\u2019t come.

Ben can put on his big boy pants, and eat what he can, and just look at all of the food that he does not prefer, just like he would have to in the big bad world. Or he can stay home.", "NTA - this dude is extended family and you were being nice accepting him into your party. I think it\u2019s obvious why Ben\u2019s own parents didn\u2019t want him at Christmas dinner: he\u2019s an asshole. If your BIL would rather not go and spend time with \u201cpoor Ben\u201d then let them enjoy their bland food and you enjoy your day with family.", "Nta", "Boy howdy. NTA.", "NTA. Ben is ridiculous. No wonder his parents don't want him around for Christmas, they want ONE meal with something other than salt. \n\nAs a compromise, maybe invite Ben to join you all for dessert and drinks *after* dinner is done. \n\nQuestion: does Ben not go to restaurants either?", "Info: why don\u2019t Ben\u2019s parents want him home for Christmas as he lives with them?

But Ben and Tom are for claiming Ben is being \"excluded.\" This is full-on bullshittery. It matters not that Ben can't stand the smell of spices, suck it up or don't go, but don't expect someone else's family to sacrifice all flavor just because you like bland food. You were doing him a favor by inviting him in the first place, and willing to make something just for him. Yet they dare accuse you of excluding him??  Assholes, both of them.", "NTA on the basics - it\u2019s nice of you to make someone their own food, but they do not get to dictate the entire menu. You should not have lost your temper and called him childish, but I guess you know that. It would have been enough to say that you were only inviting him as a favour to *your* party, and *your* party has *your* food.", "Tell Ben he\u2019s more than welcome. You\u2019re more than happy to make a few things to his preference.

They can't expect everyone else to eat like that.", "NTA Ben's own family doesn't want his entitled butt for the holidays.   It's very obvious why they don't want him", "NTA. Fuck picky eaters.", "NTA. That's not a reasonable accommodation. Does he ever even eat at restaurants?", "NTA, what are Tom and Ben planning instead?", "NTA. You really don't have to accommodate anyone", "NTA.\nGosh a relative eats mostly like that (salt and like 5 different herbs and two seasoning sauces (like teriaky) with a few spices but nothing with pepper, garlic, ginger, chilies, heat etc so these sauces are also changed to their taste) and its exhausting. I can not cook my favorite dishes for my family as they wont eat them and we have to accommodate them. If I make tomato sauce I can not fry a bit onion and garlic for its base, only salt and a few italian herbs allowed. When I want spicy food its always \"you can add hot sauce and chili flakes on your plate\" when some dishes just NEED to cook an hour or fry with ALL spices to make the taste nice and the rest of my family wishes that they taste normal, as well. Plain potatoes with salt are great but not if your food tastes like that everyday....", "NTA.\n\nYou even offered to make Ben his own food so he has something he can eat. Expecting everyone to eat bland food is entitled brat behaviour (of an adult) and Tom is one too because he's not calling him out and now tries to manipulate you.\n\nNo you do not have to ruin everyone's Christmas Dinner for one person that wasn't even invited by yourself. You did your best to accommodate him. Neither did you try to exclude him, but if he wants to come he has to suck it up that he will need to sit next to people eating spices... unless he's got a life threatening allergy that is induced by breathing in the smell of spices his behaviour is simply rude. \n\nBen and Tom aren't the center of the universe (oh what shock to them I guess) and they have to learn that you don't always get what you want (their parents clearly didn't teach them). \n\nYou did everything right. You can tell Tom that if he or Ben are changing their mind you'll still be happy to have them there but that you won't change your whole menu for a childish reason like this and that Ben will have his own food but is free to taste anything else available if he feels left out.\n\nJust beware that if Ben shows up I doubt it'll stop here. It'll be too cold or too hot... the cookies aren't the same as the ones his mummy makes and so on.  And Tom will say \"but we have to make Ben comfortable, even if everyone else here is uncomfortable in return\". Be prepared for more trouble if they both show up, which means for your sake I hope Ben at least won't.\n\nDon't let it spoil your holidays either way, you did everything right.\n\nMerry Christmas. \ud83c\udf84\u2728\ufe0f", "NTA even if he did have arfid skiing everyone ends to forgo spices is an outrageous ask. I can see why he's getting pushed out for Christmas by his parents this year lol", "Take out a portion for Mr. Bland before you add the seasonings for everyone else. \n\nNTA", "OP you are NTA. Not even close. That's a ridiculous request and childish from Ben. You went out of your way to make him a separate plate with three salt only items. But no, he can't beat to be around other people eating food he does not like. \n\nOh, and Tom, let me save you some time. When you post in here asking \"AITA for refusing to come to family Christmas because they won't accommodate my brother?\"\n\nYes Tom, yes you are.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your sister, her husband, and his brother can stay home and eat saltines.", "NTA obviously but maybe you could compromise, Ben and Tom stay at his parents house and you invite their parents who probably want to eat something with flavor to it for the holidays.", "NTA. No wonder his own parents didn't want him to stay for Christmas.", "Definately NTA here. I mean Ben is not even family. Only an in-law. Tell him tough patookey and cook for the family.", "Nta. I detest the smell of lox and cream cheese. Still buy it for my husband,  just about every week. I don't have to eat it, but I can't tell an adult he can't have it in a house we share! \n\nWe need to bring back dangerous toys like lawn darts. Too many morons are making it to adulthood.", "Hmmmm\u2026 Not invited to his own family\u2019s Christmas. Why ever not?!? \ud83d\ude44\nI\u2019m a picky eater too. When I go to someone else\u2019s house, I eat what I like (there is usually SOMETHING) and have a snack later if I\u2019m still hungry. \nI feel this is on the parents. My mom made dinner and that was what the family ate. We weren\u2019t allowed to make other meals or sandwiches. Find something on the table or don\u2019t eat. Not to say there weren\u2019t some exceptions for dishes we despised, but as a general rule it was take it if leave it.  I\u2019m sure it was work and sometimes a fight, but now I don\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s family meal and try to make it all about myself.", "I re read the post and just realized Ben's parents don't want him IN HIS OWN HOME for the holidays.\n\nNTA at all", "That was my first thought. They finally want to enjoy a Christmas dinner. Invite them and Tom and bro can sit and eat bland food together...alone.", "Not just request - demand, and then try to publicly shame OP when they said no. .... I'm curious now well OP even knows her BIL's  brother. I see mine maybe once every year or two - if that.", "_\"His parents didn't want him there this year.\"_\n\nHmmmmm. I wonder why \ud83d\ude02. If someone's parents don't want them at Christmas dinner, there must be a reason. The reason seems to be that Ben is an entitled AH who wants others to bend to his demands.... NTA. Tom & Ben can go whine to their parents.", "Exactly. This is like people who have religious beliefs and want everyone to have same belief or they cry that they are being persecuted!", "They don't want him either!", "No decency is not trying to turn an entire meal about yourself. Sorry but the bil is not even l\u2019art if OP\u2019s family . He got accommodations if that\u2019s not enough he can eat with his brother alone. Maybe there is a reason his own parents don\u2019t want him", "Picky eaters deserve to be called out. If he can't handle it he can fuck off. Noone should eat bland food because someone doesn't like spices.", "It's one thing to be a picky eater, but to expect EVERYONE to have to be is ridiculous! Your husband needs to read this post to know NO ONE agreed with him.", "Lots of people eat plain food, for many reasons.", "You absolutely did nothing wrong. \n\nYour BIL and his parents are doing his brother a disservice by coddling him from real life. Does he have a job? What does he do when someone heats up something spicy for lunch in the breakroom microwave? \n\nIt blows my mind that an adult would dream of expecting their hostess to change the entire menu for everyone else to accommodate his preferences. And that another adult (your BIL) would think it was a reasonable request.\n\nI feel sorry for your sister - assuming that she was unaware that Ben would pull this trick. Her husband is the AH - his reaction was way over the top and he needs to apologize to you. I'm glad you called his bluff and didn't relent.", "I have smells that are triggers for my migraines.

I give them window seats regularly.", "It was probably everyone else laughing at his brother that set him off. \n\nBut maybe that will wake him up to how bizarre it is that his brother would think it was reasonable to dictate to you how the meal was cooked for everyone.\n\nTom definitely owes you - and his wife - an apology.", "I don\u2019t think you know the words meaning lol", "You sure got a lot of hostility toward him lol.

He needs a slap in the face.", "\"Shirtail Kin\"", "I have friends with ARFID. They are not bothered by what others eat, although I know others might be. Is that usually a thing?", "I can't, no, as I am capcaisin sensitive. The couple times I used a product with it in it by mistake were awful experiences.\n\nIt apparently to people who don't react (like my partner), just feels kind of warm or tingly, a pleasant warming like a heating pad or parrafin dip. There should be little or no skin redness, like a blush or flush at most. \n\nTo me, it feels like a severe sunburn or a moderate localized burn (like catching your face with a curling iron, or grabbing a hot pan.) And I get an angry raised red patch on my skin.  \n\nWashing off the cream still leaves pain, irritation, and redness for several hours to a day.  Topical cortisone cream will reduce it.\n\nI have a lot of weird food sensitivities, both dietary and dermal.  Cinnamon gives me a similar topical reaction, and also tastes overwhelmingly \"spice-y\" to the point of unpleasantness in even very small doses.  Like, commercial pie spice blends are too strong to be comfortable for me. I *like* a cinnamon note in some things, but use literally 1/10 or less of what a recipe calls for or it's gross to me.", "You may also have a sensitivity to piperine, the \"heat\" in black pepper, then.  \n\nMy partner who isn't capcaisin sensitive (but still doesn't enjoy spicy food) has a piperine sensitivity. Too much black pepper, especially course fresh ground, can taste \"hotter\" to them than mild peppers.\n\nPiperine is concentrated in the skin, which is removed in processing of white pepper. So a lot of people who are bothered by black pepper can eat white pepper with no problem. \n\nAnd yeah, wasabi and horseradish are \"flavor\" hot without feeling \"mouth burns and lips tingle\" hot. Still don't enjoy them, but they do not cause the same physical reaction peppers do for me."]}
