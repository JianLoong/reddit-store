As there are all kinds of dietary restrictions in the family, I asked ahead of time if anyone had discovered any new allergies or intolerances so that I could put together a Christmas menu that everyone would like and that there would be something for everyone to eat. Everything 'normal', so I've already done the shopping for the ingredients I'll need.\n\nMy sister Sarah asked yesterday if she could take her brother-in-law (Ben, 23M) for Christmas as his parents didn't want him there this year (Ben lives with his parents). I said yes and texted him his dietary preferences/restrictions. It turns out that Ben is an extremely picky eater who has an aversion to any type of seasoning other than salt. I was really shocked, I (and my family) love spices and seasoning and the idea of using just salt in food appalls me, but I said I could make him pasta, chicken and mashed potatoes with just salt (some of the very few items what he eats). Ben said it wouldn't work as there would be a table full of spices and that he can't even stand the smell and that I should just make the food with salt. I did not answer him.\n\nI called Sarah and said it wouldn't work if Ben wanted to change the whole menu and just... salt. That either he ate his food (chicken, mash and pasta) and left the others alone or he better not come. She agreed and said she would talk to her husband (Tom).\n\nToday, Tom, Ben's brother, complained in the family group that we were mean for not accommodating Ben's dietary restriction and excluding him at Christmas. Until that moment, the family didn't know what it was and when they found out they started laughing at Tom and Ben's \"childish taste\" and that \"no one wanted to eat boring food without seasoning\". Tom called all of us and especially me AH and said he wouldn't come to Christmas with us if we excluded Ben.\n\nI lost my temper and told Tom that I wasn't going to ruin the whole family's Christmas due to his brother being a picky eater who can't stand spices, that his brother has no special condition (food restriction) and was just a spoiled adult who eats 5 foods.\n\nTom said I was AH and left the group. The family agrees with me, but Sarah is sad that Tom doesn't want to go to the family Christmas.\n\nBefore anyone asks: no, Ben doesn't have any restrictions/allergy/ARFID or dietary issues. He just doesn't like/has no interest/has never tried certain foods/spices.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671235459, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znt3ov/aita_for_refusing_to_make_only_no_seasoning_food/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being a picky eater is one thing, being a picky eater and wanting everyone else to adhere to your food rules is ridiculous and entitled.\n\nGood for you for putting your foot down.", "NTA \n\nHow rude of a tag along guest to even request that.", "NTA. To expect a whole party to eat the way you want them to is such a weird expectation. If Ben is seriously triggered, he needs a therapist.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I know why Ben\u2019s parents are MIA this season. \n\nLol, *season*. Pun unintended.", "NTA. Ben's own parents didn't want him for Christmas? WTF? That's...different. \n\nNope. I'm all for accommodating food allergies and intolerances. I will even entertain omitting spices should someone not care for them from a dish, but I will not remove all spices from all dishes. No. That's a reach of an ask. \n\nBland Ben's problems are his to own and manage.", "Honestly even if it were a medical restriction, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect everyone else to go without basic seasoning. I\u2019d feel bad, but that\u2019s a situation where someone is just not a good fit for a dinner party.  In your situation as well, NTA", "NTA.  You were more than accommodating and willing to make food for Ben.  Tom tried to call you out in front of anyone and got his ass (metaphorically) handed to him.  Tom was \ud83d\udcafin the wrong", "NTA - Ben can bring his own food if he only can eat salt.  Ben can\u2019t dictate the entire meal of another family.  Ben is ridiculous.", "NTA! Tell little Benny and Tommy to go do one.", "NTA. I can understand why his parents don't want him for Christmas this year. I have several eating problems and I hate it when someone says it's childish taste or they try to convince me to change my limitations, but he makes the mistake when he expects other people to accommodate him. What you are doing is already more than expected.", "NTA. That was a perfectly reasonable compromise to give him his own separate food and he really has no right to dictate that everyone else does without some extra flavour just because he can only stand salt. I can well imagine his own family are getting a bit fed up of it as well and that's why he's not spending Christmas with them this year.", "NTA.  You attempted to accommodate, and he insisted everyone had to eat it too.", "NTA.  Tell Ben to make other plans.", "NTA tell him if he wants bland food he can stay home.", "NTA it was nice of you to offer to make him food with just salt. It seems like the biggest issue is that he can't stand the smell. Can you put a salt-only food table outside for him? (IDK where you live) I wouldn't cave on the no seasonings bit. \n\n\"He just doesn't like/has no interest/has never tried certain foods/spices.\" \n\nThis part doesn't seem quite right. If he just has no interest, he would be able to sit in a room with spices where he is eating his salted food.", "NTA. You tried to accommodate for him and he refused, wanting everyone else to change what they ate just for him- you just don't do that if someone is allowing you to go to their home!\n\nI'm a ridiculously fussy eater (ARFID) and would never expect anyone to accommodate just for me, I would either offer to take my own, or just not eat if the food wasn't something I would eat.", "Nta. He can bring his own food if he wants to not eat anything from a table full of seasoned food. You were willing to accommodate and still they denied the offer. You did too much because I would\u2019ve just said \u201ctell him to bring his own food\u201d off top. Enjoy your Christmas, he will regret not going. That\u2019s his choice, not yours.", "NTA I wish you hadn\u2019t lost your temper and when Tom had said he wasn\u2019t coming, you had simply said, ok that\u2019s up to you. That\u2019s in the past now. Ben is an adult and absolutely nobody should get to decide that the entire group cannot enjoy eating normally. It\u2019s incredibly entitled. Do not feel bad, do not apologize.", "NTA - I feel like Ben is a guest at your house and should be thankful to have a place to celebrate the holidays. You did your part by offering him an alternative meal with his preferences. I admire Tom for standing up for his brother but I think he should realize the entitlement of requesting EVERYONE's Christmas meal to be downgraded to rudimentary tastes because he doesn't like the smell of food in your house. If it was my brother complaining about the food at MY in-laws, I would have told him to shut up and eat lol.", "NTA. But if Tom has sensory issues eg taste then I think making fun of his was being rude and arseholeish. But for Tom and Ben to expect no one eat spice makes them the arsehole.", "NTA - I bet Bens parents couldn\u2019t wait to get him out the house for one holiday, they probably have the oregano and paprika on standby.", "NTA.\n\nBen can't pull the \"poor little unwanted me\" card to get an invitation, and then demand that you make *everyone else's* food to his specifications. That's not how it works. You were willing to make special spice free dishes for him, but he is way out of line. \n\nIf he doesn't like the smell of spices in other people's food, he can put Vicks under his nose so that he can't smell it, eat out in the car, or stay home.\n\nThe sense of entitlement is unreal!", "NTA. Ben chooses to eat that way. If he doesn\u2019t like what is offered, and isn\u2019t ok with the compromise offered, then he shouldn\u2019t come. It sounds like Ben has been coddled and enabled by his family and Tom is continuing that behavior.", "You don't invite someone to someone else's home and demand a whole new menu. No, just no. NTA. Ben can put on his big boy pants, and eat what he can, and just look at all of the food that he does not prefer, just like he would have to in the big bad world. Or he can stay home.", "NTA - this dude is extended family and you were being nice accepting him into your party. I think it\u2019s obvious why Ben\u2019s own parents didn\u2019t want him at Christmas dinner: he\u2019s an asshole. If your BIL would rather not go and spend time with \u201cpoor Ben\u201d then let them enjoy their bland food and you enjoy your day with family.", "Nta", "Boy howdy. NTA.", "NTA. Ben is ridiculous. No wonder his parents don't want him around for Christmas, they want ONE meal with something other than salt. \n\nAs a compromise, maybe invite Ben to join you all for dessert and drinks *after* dinner is done. \n\nQuestion: does Ben not go to restaurants either?", "Info: why don\u2019t Ben\u2019s parents want him home for Christmas as he lives with them? It seems like Ben may be a difficult person for everyone to be around?", "NTA. I'm shocked that his own parents don't want him around for Christmas.", "NTA.... No wonder his parents want him out of the house...", "NTA - It's one thing to accommodate someone, and you made reasonable offers. To expect a whole family to give up spices because he can sense them YEAH NO DUDE. Bridge too far. No wonder his family was fast to foist him off. It'll probably be the best meal they have had in years.", "NTA. They are more than welcome to bring separate food.", "Just tell your sister to bring her other boyfriend", "NTA. But Ben and Tom are for claiming Ben is being \"excluded.\" This is full-on bullshittery. It matters not that Ben can't stand the smell of spices, suck it up or don't go, but don't expect someone else's family to sacrifice all flavor just because you like bland food. You were doing him a favor by inviting him in the first place, and willing to make something just for him. Yet they dare accuse you of excluding him??  Assholes, both of them.", "NTA on the basics - it\u2019s nice of you to make someone their own food, but they do not get to dictate the entire menu. You should not have lost your temper and called him childish, but I guess you know that. It would have been enough to say that you were only inviting him as a favour to *your* party, and *your* party has *your* food.", "Tell Ben he\u2019s more than welcome. You\u2019re more than happy to make a few things to his preference. Dinner is at x time and you\u2019re looking forward to seeing him. \n\nIf he chooses not to come, that\u2019s up to him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
