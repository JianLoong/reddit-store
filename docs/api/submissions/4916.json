As there are all kinds of dietary restrictions in the family, I asked ahead of time if anyone had discovered any new allergies or intolerances so that I could put together a Christmas menu that everyone would like and that there would be something for everyone to eat. Everything 'normal', so I've already done the shopping for the ingredients I'll need.\n\nMy sister Sarah asked yesterday if she could take her brother-in-law (Ben, 23M) for Christmas as his parents didn't want him there this year (Ben lives with his parents). I said yes and texted him his dietary preferences/restrictions. It turns out that Ben is an extremely picky eater who has an aversion to any type of seasoning other than salt. I was really shocked, I (and my family) love spices and seasoning and the idea of using just salt in food appalls me, but I said I could make him pasta, chicken and mashed potatoes with just salt (some of the very few items what he eats). Ben said it wouldn't work as there would be a table full of spices and that he can't even stand the smell and that I should just make the food with salt. I did not answer him.\n\nI called Sarah and said it wouldn't work if Ben wanted to change the whole menu and just... salt. That either he ate his food (chicken, mash and pasta) and left the others alone or he better not come. She agreed and said she would talk to her husband (Tom).\n\nToday, Tom, Ben's brother, complained in the family group that we were mean for not accommodating Ben's dietary restriction and excluding him at Christmas. Until that moment, the family didn't know what it was and when they found out they started laughing at Tom and Ben's \"childish taste\" and that \"no one wanted to eat boring food without seasoning\". Tom called all of us and especially me AH and said he wouldn't come to Christmas with us if we excluded Ben.\n\nI lost my temper and told Tom that I wasn't going to ruin the whole family's Christmas due to his brother being a picky eater who can't stand spices, that his brother has no special condition (food restriction) and was just a spoiled adult who eats 5 foods.\n\nTom said I was AH and left the group. The family agrees with me, but Sarah is sad that Tom doesn't want to go to the family Christmas.\n\nBefore anyone asks: no, Ben doesn't have any restrictions/allergy/ARFID or dietary issues.

I have several eating problems and I hate it when someone says it's childish taste or they try to convince me to change my limitations, but he makes the mistake when he expects other people to accommodate him. What you are doing is already more than expected.", "NTA. That was a perfectly reasonable compromise to give him his own separate food and he really has no right to dictate that everyone else does without some extra flavour just because he can only stand salt.

You did your part by offering him an alternative meal with his preferences. I admire Tom for standing up for his brother but I think he should realize the entitlement of requesting EVERYONE's Christmas meal to be downgraded to rudimentary tastes because he doesn't like the smell of food in your house. If it was my brother complaining about the food at MY in-laws, I would have told him to shut up and eat lol.", "NTA. But if Tom has sensory issues eg taste then I think making fun of his was being rude and arseholeish.

That's not how it works. You were willing to make special spice free dishes for him, but he is way out of line. \n\nIf he doesn't like the smell of spices in other people's food, he can put Vicks under his nose so that he can't smell it, eat out in the car, or stay home.\n\nThe sense of entitlement is unreal!", "NTA. Ben chooses to eat that way. If he doesn\u2019t like what is offered, and isn\u2019t ok with the compromise offered, then he shouldn\u2019t come.

Or he can stay home.", "NTA - this dude is extended family and you were being nice accepting him into your party. I think it\u2019s obvious why Ben\u2019s own parents didn\u2019t want him at Christmas dinner: he\u2019s an asshole. If your BIL would rather not go and spend time with \u201cpoor Ben\u201d then let them enjoy their bland food and you enjoy your day with family.", "Nta", "Boy howdy. NTA.", "NTA. Ben is ridiculous. No wonder his parents don't want him around for Christmas, they want ONE meal with something other than salt. \n\nAs a compromise, maybe invite Ben to join you all for dessert and drinks *after* dinner is done. \n\nQuestion: does Ben not go to restaurants either?", "Info: why don\u2019t Ben\u2019s parents want him home for Christmas as he lives with them?

But Ben and Tom are for claiming Ben is being \"excluded.\" This is full-on bullshittery. It matters not that Ben can't stand the smell of spices, suck it up or don't go, but don't expect someone else's family to sacrifice all flavor just because you like bland food. You were doing him a favor by inviting him in the first place, and willing to make something just for him. Yet they dare accuse you of excluding him??  Assholes, both of them.", "NTA on the basics - it\u2019s nice of you to make someone their own food, but they do not get to dictate the entire menu. You should not have lost your temper and called him childish, but I guess you know that. It would have been enough to say that you were only inviting him as a favour to *your* party, and *your* party has *your* food.", "Tell Ben he\u2019s more than welcome. You\u2019re more than happy to make a few things to his preference.

During the fourth of July my dad made smoked ribs, peach pie, crispy herbed potatoes, buttermilk biscuits, baked beans, and grilled a huge load of marinated veggies. My brother was so wrecked from the antibiotics he could only stomach plain boiled chicken and brown rice. He looked so sad as the rest of us feasted.", "Even my rural Nebraska family in the 1980s used more than salt. At least pepper.  I did used to get in \"trouble\" for adding garlic to everything- but BEFORE anyone ate it.  After they tasted it, they were always \"how are you such a good cook!!!\"....um, I use more than salt and pepper to make stuff, and read recipes other than the 4h cookbook from 1956 (which had EXCELLENT baked goods, but not the best spice profiles for savory options).", "There you go! Sit him by himself inside with his bland ass food where his senses won't be offended by normal people enjoying normal food. Call it the toddler's tantrum table, since he is acting like a 2 year old. His brother can join him if he can't bear to eat alone. One of my nephews was a very picky eater into young adulthood, though not close to as bad as this guy. I have no idea how she did it, but I will be forever grateful to the lovely woman he married. He'll eat just about anything now, and at least TRY something before saying he doesn't like it.", "Unless you cook everything outside if he's that sensitive to smells then if you cooked anything else besides his bland meal he's going to have to smell spices. Tom and Ben should just stay home and make a bland meal or if you're feeling generous send the bland meal to them through your sister.", "Why does a 23 year old man need to stay with someone while his parents are gone?", "If anyone reading all this is curious, google \"ARFID\"\n\n(To be clear, this information in no way changes that OP is NTA and made the absolute right call about how to handle this situation.

That supports that person.  Forcing an entire group of people to have an awful meal to cater to one person makes no sense. Perhaps now that Tom isn\u2019t coming he can cook for his brother and celebrate Christmas with him since Tom has let it be known he won\u2019t have any problem with bland food.", "NTA. Ben is 23 years old, but apparently hasn't grown up much.", "NTA offering to make a couple of separate things was generous  Him not wanting any spices etc anywhere be cause he doesn\u2019t like them is just being entitled.

You have no idea how exhausting it is to try to eat anywhere or cook for somebody like that. Or to eat what they cook. I have no empathy for people who cannot grow past the age of three with their eating preferences. Brother-in-law needs to grow the hell up. My hell! You even offered to make him special dishes tailored to his dietary preferences, not needs - preferences. He wouldn't even accommodate the smells of spices in the same room. I'm amazed his parents lasted that long without giving him the heave ho for Christmas and Thanksgiving. He's the a hole. You're not. NTA", "NTA. Ben's food aversions are his responsibility. If Tom is so offended, he can host his brother. It's unreasonable to demand the world change for Tom. You tried to be accommodating, but Tom wants to dictate the entire menu. That's incredibly entitled and unreasonable.", "Is Ben on the Spectrum?", "Nta. The entitlement is overwhelming. He really expects yall to make the blandest tastelest food yall can.

I have a friend like Ben, we always cook food, separate some, and leave him some that's unseasoned, and the rest of us eat the seasoned portion. My friend though, if he's absolutely in a picky mood, he brings himself something to eat, or checks ahead of time to see if we have something for him, and if it's okay that he eats it.

I just can\u2019t handle the heat literally lmao", "This is the way. My family takes portions out before adding dairy to the food.

Sounds like his parents contributed to him developing it by not guiding him toward healthy eating choices and expanding his food choices over time. I'll bet they hated their home being controlled in this way, but it's their fault. I have two daughters who were extremely picky as children. I didn't play into it. I offered them healthy choices that were reasonable for kids their age. I didn't make an issue out of it, but I didn't cater to it either. It's funny because they only would eat McDonald's food when we went out. One day, I was sick of McDonald's and went to Subway. They were hungry, and they caved. Guess what their favorite restaurant is now? Yep, Subway. They are in their teens now and still are a bit picky, but they will eat within the range of what I would call a normal selection and would never put a host through something like that.", "You likely have a mild capsaicin sensitivity, then.

Whenever we go to Mexican restaurants, I have to ask for the \u201cwimpy\u201d salsa. But fast casual restaurants are the worst, because more than a minor amount of red or green peppers and I will be doubled over in severe pain. There\u2019s just something about them that makes my intestines feel like I\u2019m being stabbed. So no peppers, no jalape\u00f1os, none of the fun stuff for me.", "You beat me to it.
