It's your event and your MIL's property. Your mother had no right to invite anyone, much less everyone she knows.\n\nIf you need a laugh, my family has a similar but much more ridiculous story. My dad's mother used to teach at a nearby Hudderite colony. (They're like the Amish in that they eschew a lot of modern life, but I don't know enough to give you a more nuanced explanation.) When my parents decided to get married, I think that Grandma was upset with their choice of guest list. Dad's side of the family is huge, while Mom's is small and mostly lived on the other side of the Atlantic (except for her parents, brother, and my grandfather's second cousin who eloped to Florida with a Nazi). I think, but am not certain, that my parents had an equal share of the guest list but Grandma felt that was unfair since Dad's side was so much larger. \n\nGrandma invited literally *the entire Hudderite colony*. As I understand it, she just casually mentioned to my parents that she'd invited however many hundred people. Thankfully, none of the Hudderites were willing to travel 100+ miles in a horse-drawn buggy during the North Dakota winter just to attend the wedding of someone they barely knew to someone they'd never met. Still, my parents were *not* happy.\n\nMy parents think that this story is a lot funnier now. I'm not saying you have to just GeT oVeR iT, because your mother and my grandmother definitely crossed lines (especially your mother), and... actually, I don't know what I'm saying.

Your mom disregarded what you wanted to invite her friends how she wanted. Now, anyone can come or harass the host.\n\nAnyone can arrive and do anything. It just takes one stupid or crazy person or decision to cause potentially extreme danger. You could have strangers showing up and screaming about not being let in or any myriad of issues.\n\nYour mom may have done this on purpose to get the host harassed. She posted the info, could lie about the numbers or you being 'mean', and could be trying to use the harassment to force to get what she wants.\n\nYour mother chose not to delete the post. She's choosing to be cruel to you and to put you in danger. She won't take responsibility for herself, so you have to treat her as she's teaching you to treat her.\n\nMake two posts. The first one has to be a new post including her old post and everyone tagged in it. Be as clear as possible. Say that you mom wasn't supposed to post, disregarded you asking to take it down, and that she lied about the spaces available. That you are the only source for information.

An ex of her fiance decided to crash the party and we had to call the police.\n\nOne of my aunt's did it to her adult daughter for her birthday. It was flooded by randos and I personally dragged the woman out. I have a heart condition and had no choice. Low hell, high water, she wasn't ever going to apologize and was causing a spectacle that made my cousin cry. \n\nIt happened to crazy family in Florida during Covid. Three different sisters posted the kids info and it turned into mass Covid infections that lead to the worst. The sisters never apologized.\n\nBesides stress, Covid is a real danger to you. There's increased risk of miscarriage and your treatment options would be limited by pregnancy. If your party gets invaded, you have no reassurances.", "Report it to Facebook.
