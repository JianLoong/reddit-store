If you need, I'd be glad to call her and tell her how OUT OF LINE she is to post that.  My God, how clueless and entitled can you be?!", "NTA. I would have told her either she takes it down immediately or she is uninvited.

It's your event and your MIL's property. Your mother had no right to invite anyone, much less everyone she knows.\n\nIf you need a laugh, my family has a similar but much more ridiculous story. My dad's mother used to teach at a nearby Hudderite colony. (They're like the Amish in that they eschew a lot of modern life, but I don't know enough to give you a more nuanced explanation.) When my parents decided to get married, I think that Grandma was upset with their choice of guest list. Dad's side of the family is huge, while Mom's is small and mostly lived on the other side of the Atlantic (except for her parents, brother, and my grandfather's second cousin who eloped to Florida with a Nazi). I think, but am not certain, that my parents had an equal share of the guest list but Grandma felt that was unfair since Dad's side was so much larger. \n\nGrandma invited literally *the entire Hudderite colony*. As I understand it, she just casually mentioned to my parents that she'd invited however many hundred people. Thankfully, none of the Hudderites were willing to travel 100+ miles in a horse-drawn buggy during the North Dakota winter just to attend the wedding of someone they barely knew to someone they'd never met. Still, my parents were *not* happy.\n\nMy parents think that this story is a lot funnier now. I'm not saying you have to just GeT oVeR iT, because your mother and my grandmother definitely crossed lines (especially your mother), and... actually, I don't know what I'm saying. I guess that people do dumb things about others' events? Yeah, let's go with that.", "No, You are not the asshole your Mom should respect your bindery\u2019s and it\u2019s YOUR baby shower not hers she doesn\u2019t have a right to post that.", "Just read your post history.

You will be the same as any distant friend.  No social media posts about the pregnancy.  None.  This is down within the next minute.
