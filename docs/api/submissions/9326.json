Your Mom sure is an AH though.\n\nYou are not over reacting. Your Mom is under reacting to her massive breach of the host's privacy. She gave personal identifying information - name, address, and either email or phone information freely to 500 strangers.\n\nI'd report her post to facebook immediately and tell your Mom if it is not down with 10 minutes you will be commenting this on it.\n\n\"This is a private party. My mother used poor judgement by posting this invitation. Think twice before inviting her to anything lest she do the same to you.\"", "OMG. She did NOT!  I would lose my ever-lovin mind if my mother did that! Wow!\n\n**NTA.**", "I\u2019m embarrassed for you. Your mother is going to have to show up at this family friend\u2019s house and explain herself.\n\nSomething tells me she\u2019s not going to be so warmly received. \n\nNTA \n\nShe\u2019s blatantly pushing your boundaries she needs consequences if she is not going to respect you.", "NTA\n\nI am probably close in age to your mother (I'm 61).  If you need, I'd be glad to call her and tell her how OUT OF LINE she is to post that.  My God, how clueless and entitled can you be?!", "NTA. I would have told her either she takes it down immediately or she is uninvited. Then I would have a long talk with her about boundaries and letting her know in no uncertain terms that if she wants to see her grandchild, she can start following your rules for the shower, the birth, the baby, everything.", "NTA. Report the post to FB, may have an option for doxxing or personal info released without consent? \n\nNot sure if you can post on her page. If so,  make a post that the invite shown below is a template and not finalized, please ignore...\ud83d\ude33\n\n\nI'm sorry this happened!", "NTA\n\nYour reaction is normal for the situation. You and your mom would end-up with problems too if there were more than 30 people who are willing to go to the event. If your mom didn't know that there's a guest limit, it should be more reason to NOT broadcast the invitations.", "NTA - but your mom is. 1) For sharing someone\u2019s address and personal phone number on social media 2) disregarding the wishes of you, her daughter, for her own personal wishes when it\u2019s your pregnancy/baby\u2026 3) Probably doing things like this your whole life and getting away with it since you\u2019re questioning whether YOU are the asshole in a situation where she is very obviously the asshole.", "**NTA**  You should have told your mother that if she didn't take it down immediately, you would report the post to Feedback and get it taken down that way.\n\nYour mother is clearly boundary challenged and I suspect she's already been a problem in your marriage.   You need to stiffen that spine and shut her down.", "Of course NTA\n\nForget trying to reason with your mother. SHe seems to be blowing you off as a power play. Just report the post directly to Facebook and have *them* take it down.", "NTA and depending on where you are and what the privacy laws are, what your mother did could be illegal.", "NTA, at all. But your mom sure is. \n\nTell her that if she doesn\u2019t take it down in the next 5 minutes, you will comment on the post saying it is a private party and that your mom posted without your permission.\n\nWhat she did is inappropriate, and totally unfair to you, and to the host of the party whose personal info is now public without their permission. \n\nIt sounds like your mom has no understanding of how social media works. But I don\u2019t have sympathy for her, since she is being so dismissive of you and the host\u2019s concerns.", "NTA WTF yeah that could end badly. Does she have any idea what people online do with other peoples addresses and a free invite? God knows where that could end up. Fingers crossed.", "NTA. This is a demand. Your mother did not listen to it. You have a serious problem, and must undermine her to win.", "NTA, your mother shared the personal information of someone she doesn't have a direct relationship with. They're doing you a favour, it takes 10 seconds to remove a Facebook post. Frankly, she's being ridiculous.", "Does your mother have boundary issues? You might want to nip this in the bud before the baby arrives. You're totally NTA, but this is just... objectively bad behavior on her part.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like a complete power play on your mom\u2019s part! Hopefully by now you\u2019ve reported to FB for them to take down if she didn\u2019t immediately! \n\nTime to set real hard boundaries with your mom about sharing other people\u2019s personal information and what kind of damage it can cause to your relationship with your in laws!", "NTA \n\nJust uninvite your Mum. \n\nNo one is too busy to press three dots and press delete.
