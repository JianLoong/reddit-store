Your Mom sure is an AH though.\n\nYou are not over reacting. Your Mom is under reacting to her massive breach of the host's privacy.

Your mother is going to have to show up at this family friend\u2019s house and explain herself.\n\nSomething tells me she\u2019s not going to be so warmly received. \n\nNTA \n\nShe\u2019s blatantly pushing your boundaries she needs consequences if she is not going to respect you.", "NTA\n\nI am probably close in age to your mother (I'm 61).  If you need, I'd be glad to call her and tell her how OUT OF LINE she is to post that.  My God, how clueless and entitled can you be?!", "NTA. I would have told her either she takes it down immediately or she is uninvited. Then I would have a long talk with her about boundaries and letting her know in no uncertain terms that if she wants to see her grandchild, she can start following your rules for the shower, the birth, the baby, everything.", "NTA. Report the post to FB, may have an option for doxxing or personal info released without consent? \n\nNot sure if you can post on her page.

Does she have any idea what people online do with other peoples addresses and a free invite? God knows where that could end up. Fingers crossed.", "NTA. This is a demand. Your mother did not listen to it. You have a serious problem, and must undermine her to win.", "NTA, your mother shared the personal information of someone she doesn't have a direct relationship with.

It's your event and your MIL's property. Your mother had no right to invite anyone, much less everyone she knows.\n\nIf you need a laugh, my family has a similar but much more ridiculous story. My dad's mother used to teach at a nearby Hudderite colony. (They're like the Amish in that they eschew a lot of modern life, but I don't know enough to give you a more nuanced explanation.) When my parents decided to get married, I think that Grandma was upset with their choice of guest list. Dad's side of the family is huge, while Mom's is small and mostly lived on the other side of the Atlantic (except for her parents, brother, and my grandfather's second cousin who eloped to Florida with a Nazi). I think, but am not certain, that my parents had an equal share of the guest list but Grandma felt that was unfair since Dad's side was so much larger. \n\nGrandma invited literally *the entire Hudderite colony*. As I understand it, she just casually mentioned to my parents that she'd invited however many hundred people. Thankfully, none of the Hudderites were willing to travel 100+ miles in a horse-drawn buggy during the North Dakota winter just to attend the wedding of someone they barely knew to someone they'd never met. Still, my parents were *not* happy.\n\nMy parents think that this story is a lot funnier now. I'm not saying you have to just GeT oVeR iT, because your mother and my grandmother definitely crossed lines (especially your mother), and... actually, I don't know what I'm saying. I guess that people do dumb things about others' events? Yeah, let's go with that.", "No, You are not the asshole your Mom should respect your bindery\u2019s and it\u2019s YOUR baby shower not hers she doesn\u2019t have a right to post that.", "Just read your post history.  Why was your mother even invited to this shower?  You should already be cutting her out of anything that has to do with your baby.", "So your mom casually doxxed someone doing you a huge favor and refuses to take it down?
