It's your event and your MIL's property. Your mother had no right to invite anyone, much less everyone she knows.\n\nIf you need a laugh, my family has a similar but much more ridiculous story. My dad's mother used to teach at a nearby Hudderite colony. (They're like the Amish in that they eschew a lot of modern life, but I don't know enough to give you a more nuanced explanation.) When my parents decided to get married, I think that Grandma was upset with their choice of guest list. Dad's side of the family is huge, while Mom's is small and mostly lived on the other side of the Atlantic (except for her parents, brother, and my grandfather's second cousin who eloped to Florida with a Nazi). I think, but am not certain, that my parents had an equal share of the guest list but Grandma felt that was unfair since Dad's side was so much larger. \n\nGrandma invited literally *the entire Hudderite colony*. As I understand it, she just casually mentioned to my parents that she'd invited however many hundred people. Thankfully, none of the Hudderites were willing to travel 100+ miles in a horse-drawn buggy during the North Dakota winter just to attend the wedding of someone they barely knew to someone they'd never met. Still, my parents were *not* happy.\n\nMy parents think that this story is a lot funnier now. I'm not saying you have to just GeT oVeR iT, because your mother and my grandmother definitely crossed lines (especially your mother), and... actually, I don't know what I'm saying.

She posted the info, could lie about the numbers or you being 'mean', and could be trying to use the harassment to force to get what she wants.\n\nYour mother chose not to delete the post. She's choosing to be cruel to you and to put you in danger. She won't take responsibility for herself, so you have to treat her as she's teaching you to treat her.\n\nMake two posts. The first one has to be a new post including her old post and everyone tagged in it. Be as clear as possible.

Three different sisters posted the kids info and it turned into mass Covid infections that lead to the worst. The sisters never apologized.\n\nBesides stress, Covid is a real danger to you.

I'm sure you want your mom in your life, especially now that you're having a kid and could use the support. However, judging by your post history, your mom is never going to be the person you need her to be. It's a lot easier to work through these things before the baby comes, because once you become a mom, you will realize how important that baby is to you and you will also feel grief that your mom didn't give you the same.\n\nTake care of yourself, OP", "NTA for what you ask.\n\nAs you are the go between for your mom and your inlaws, I am uncertain that you did enough to fix the situation.", "Is this really something you needed to post?

Silly me.\") Or even not invite her mother at all, but I doubt OP would consider that to be an option given the drama it would create.", "I've had to do this before and that person did me a favor and hasn't spoken to me in six years.", "I really think she could since her mother is sharing someone else's personal contact info without permission.
