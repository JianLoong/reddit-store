She sounds a little spoiled tbh.", "NTA, the trip is a major gift. I understand her still wanting to get something on the actual day of her birthday, but a book/card/dinner/breakfast sound pretty much perfect for celebrating without too much of a financial expense.", "NTA but there are some tremendous red flags with this person.", "NTA and it\u2019s unfair of a partner to expressly say don\u2019t buy me another present and then get huffy when you do what they asked. You were kind and made sure she had a gift to open on the day, treated her with pancakes too and are throwing her a party. Your gf needs a reality check.", "Your NTA she is and a spoilt selfish one at that.", "NTA  I hate when people complain to the gift giver about the gift!  Give the tickets to her at the party with a card.", "NTA. So she made you promise not to buy her anything else because of the trip, but secretly wanted you to ignore that and buy her something expensive anyway? \n\nShe is in fact getting a very expensive trip, you were also thoughtful enough to buy her a book so she had something to open, and make her pancakes. And that wasn't good enough.\n\nYou got her a card, but it wasn't good enough because you didn't specifically reference the trip you're paying for in the card? What ?\n\nYou're planning a party, but it's not good enough, even though she doesn't actually know the details and has no idea if it's actually good enough? \n\nIt really sounds like she is quite determined to play victim and feel hard done by here.

Whenever someone expects people to just read their minds it becomes a lot of frustration and arguments, much like this situation. \n\nIf she wanted you to get her a gift for her birthday she needed to say so. If she doesn\u2019t think everything else you\u2019ve done for her doesn\u2019t count (for some bizarre reason) she needed to say so. In summary, she needs to communicate more \u2014 and not expect people to magically know what she wants then get upset when they don\u2019t.", "So she's the kind of person who says \"It's ok I don't need anything else\" but actually expects \"something else\".\n\nNTA, I feel like you should reevaluate this relationship.", "If someone booked me all expenses, paid holiday to the US, books, a party, and breakfast, I'd be over the bloody moon and so grateful. She sounds fucking ungrateful and greedy, honestly if I did something like that for my husband and he sat there with a sour face I'd cancel the whole lot.", "NTA. Wow, you\u2019re paying for an international trip, that you both agreed was her birthday gift.  You go out to dinner, get her a book you know she\u2019d love and a card, and have a party also planned for the weekend.\n\nAll of that isn\u2019t enough for her.   She was actually pissed.   Yowtch", "NTA. She's ungrateful. A whole trip to the US isn't enough? Wild.", "NTA at all", "NTA. I will say that birthdays are hard when you\u2019re estranged from your parents. Especially big milestone events. Often you\u2019re caught off-guard by emotions you weren\u2019t quite expecting, and if it\u2019s been several years even more so. \nAnother point is that a lot of women are of the mindset that 30 is some dramatic end, like you lose your value or are \u201cdone\u201d or whatnot. Big mystery to me but I\u2019d heard it so much I couldn\u2019t help but consider that when I found myself there. \n\nThese aren\u2019t excuses for her behavior- she\u2019s lashing out at the wrong person here.

She, however, is acting likely a spoilt and bratty princess. And incredibly entitled and ungrateful. \n\nThe reason she asked you the next day if you were mad at her is because she realised she had behaved badly and, instead of apologising like an adult, she just wanted to gloss over it. \n\nThe last thing you want to do in any relationship is brush stuff under the rug. I would calmly explain to her that you were hurt by her behaviour and, if you are to have a healthy relationship, she needs to use her words to express what she wants. You aren't a telepath!! And when she does use her words - to say please don't get me another present - she has to mean them. And if she changes her mind, she needs to communicate that. \n\nYou seem like an awesome boyfriend so please don't feel for a second that you did anything wrong. You are clearly a very generous person and, given the gifts your Mum got for her, I can see where you get that from.

Wanting more than that is just greedy.", "Wow I'm starting to think this is about her trying to show you off in front of her mom. Like did she open her mums gift and your gift at the same time in front of both of you?

Barely opens instagram if not for scrolling at times.", "Lol. To be honest, she did. Kinda. I don't know how much she actually felt it \"sorry I made you sad I do appreciate all you did\" (while still mentioning the card) and how much she was playing victim \"it is only a birthday after all\".", "No her parents are not in the picture. Long story but she cut them out of her life a few years ago. Her mother was narcissistic and borderline and her father followed suit.", "She wanted you to show her *parents* you were giving her a trip to the US.", "Yeah NTA", "Is she struggling with turning 30?

Hmm.", "Yeah that's what I thought too. I believe she is struggling with it more than she lets on.", "It's quite possible her mind's so focused on that, even subconsciously, that she genuinely forgot about the trip in that moment. Being vulnerable can be difficult, and she may not want to admit how much hitting 30 bothers her, since it's \"just a birthday.\" She's deflecting the attention by focusing on something inconsequential; in this case, the trip not being mentioned in the card. She's also probably embarrassed she forgot, which goes back to her deflecting.\n\nRelationships are complex and full of nuance, and we see but a sliver when people post their story. If she is otherwise a thoughtful, supportive, and loving partner, then have patience. Put your mind at ease that it doesn't actually have anything to do with you. Reapproach it later with empathy, and tell her you want to understand what's underneath her reaction. An open ear can go a long way, and hopefully it'll open up a dialog (and she'll also hopefully admit where she was wrong).\n\nHowever, if this reaction is consistent with her normal behavior, it's time to reevaluate how healthy your relationship is. \n\nMy husband and I have had to endure some major hurdles (health, family) but we're successful because we approach any problem as a united team. It's never me versus him; it's us versus the problem. We always remind each other of that, and it truly helps. I genuinely hope something I said can be helpful to you \ud83d\udc9c\n\nEta: sorry, it's 2am and I know I forgot some things. One is that your feeling hurt and sad from her reaction is 100% valid, and very understandable.", "No worries, thanks for the insight! She is usually extremely supportive and understanding: that's why I came here for advice regarding this behaviour. It seemed very out of character for her and your comment has confirmed things I have suspected. And to add to that, we are both going through pretty stressful periods with issue at work, many things to take care of and plans for some changes in our lives. I believe her turning 30 is just one more piece of stress added to the mix and you're probably right: she simply forgot about the trip and wasn't sure how to deal with the situation (she usually NEVER forgets stuff).", ">Knowing her and knowing that she would struggle accepting such a big expense for a vacation, I suggested it could be her birthday gift \n\nSo to be clear, you anticipated your gf's needs ahead of time. You anticipated that either she would be uncomfortable spending this amount of money or can't afford this trip or whatever the situation is, and before this issue could arise, you offered to cover all the expenses as her 30th bday present? And trips to the US **aren't cheap**\n\n>She made me promise that I wouldn't buy her anything else\n\n>I wrote her a card\n\n>she mentioned that I could have at least written her a card\n\nYou made sure your gf had something thoughtful to open from you on her bday, because big gift comes later, after she insisted you get her nothing. Did she really complain about what you should have done, (*get her a card*) not noticing or appreciating that you actually did that exact thing for her?\n\n>I only bought her a book I knew she would like and wrote her a card\n\n>she was pissed I \"only bought her a book for my thirtieth birthday!\"\n\nHave you noticed you adopted the same language your gf used to diminish your thoughtful 'something-to-open-now' gift you got her? \"Only a book\"?\n\n>I also reminded her that I'm planning a party for her this Saturday, which has been quite a challenge and I thought would, so to speak, count as a gift\n\nwhen you reminded her on top of a paid for trip to the US, a book and a card, you are also planning and paying for a surprise party for her, her response...\n\n>she responded with \"well yeah we're gonna stay home and play games. Doesn't sound like much\"\n\n... was to belittle and mock your party for her, the same way she did your book gift and your card.\n\n>This morning she woke me up and kept asking if I was mad at her\n\nIs she low key rushing you to move on from this situation, because your current mood makes her feel bad? \n\n>I can't figure out if I should have been more thoughtful regarding her gift or if I'm entitled to be sad about what she said since I thought we had agreed on another gift\n\nLet summarise, for her 30th: You paid for a trip to New York. You brought her a book you knew she'd like. Brought her a card and presumably wrote something sweet inside it. You are planning and organising a party for her. What more could you have done without bankrupting yourself? More importantly, if she didn't appreciate any of these gifts, what more could you have done that would have made her happy? \n\nYou've normalised your gf's behaviour. But this beyond any levels of ungrateful, rude and spoilt behaviour. This is \"is your gf royalty?\" level of entitlement. And I have to wonder, what did your gf get you for your last birthday? When was the last time she anticipated your needs? When was the last time you told her not to worry about something, and she did it anyway because she wanted you to feel loved?\n\nI have no advice to give. Honestly, you should feel sad. You went above and beyond for her for someone who as thanks treated you like trash, threw a tantrum and mocked your efforts. That's heartbreaking.

Not everyone has to be like my wife and I, but neither of us care if the other gives a gift.  We do fun vacations and go out to dinner and buy stuff for each other whenever the feeling strikes. Plus, if we say that the gift is the trip we both mean it I know each relationship is different, but her focusing on the material rather than she had a good dinner out, will have a nice party and time with friends, and she did get a book \u2014 which my wife and I would both be more than happy with \u2014 is weird to me.  You are NTA and in my view have been very thoughtful.  It would aggravate me, if my wife said that to me.  Is there something more going on or is she just materialistic?", "NTA. If you bought me a trip, to ANYWHERE, I would be thrilled for my bday/Christmas/holiday. The only thing I would ask for my actual <holiday> would be a nice dinner out somewhere, and maybe a text message or social media post acknowledging my <holiday>. If fact, my husband's bday, Christmas, our Anniversary, and my bday are all within a month of each other. The last few years, we do one big celebration for all 4 things. And that's perfectly fine with me. Buy me a cheap stuffed animal and a dinner date.", "NTA. DTMFA.", "NTA. How long have you been dating? This is a major red flag if she\u2019s gaslighting you into giving her more and more gifts. If the trip was agreed as her bday gift then that\u2019s it, you went above and beyond to get her the book and also plan a party. The longer you stay together you\u2019ll probably see her pull this more often, minimizing the gifts and work you put into the relationship and always ask for more. She\u2019s a very materialistic person.", "What? So, in total you\n\n1. organised a birthday party\n2. got her a book she'd like and wrote a card\n3. paid more that your fair share for the US holiday\n\nand none of that seems to count?

That's a bs excuse. \n\nHere, I'll translate:\n\nMy mind knows I was wrong, yet my heart is still unhappy.  But I know people will find me ungrateful as it is just a birthday. But I need you to understand it is *not* just a birthday, it was a Big Deal to me. I wanted you to blow me away for my 30th, and not with things I already knew about, however big gifts they are. I wanted you to surprise me ON my birthday. That is why I said 'no gifts', so the surprise would seem bigger. I wanted you to surprise me with something awesomely romantic or grand.

That's high school level drama and I think everyone involved is too old for that. (Heck I'm 21 and I feel too old for that)", "That was OP\u2019s mom, not the gf\u2019s mom.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t wife this game playing woman, she\u2019s exhausting.", "NTA. The older I get the more I realize that experiences are worth more than any materialistic gift. The trip and the experience is a fantastic place to put the money instead. She told you no other gift was needed so getting upset later really falls onto her. Also, I will say I tell my husband every year to buy me a book and he always gets me things he thinks I want when a book really is all I want because it is an experience in itself so I think books as gifts are fantastic!"]}
