{"id": 23019, "submission_id": "158bgce", "title": "AITA for wanting to check on my cat while on a date?", "selftext": "Fake names, throwaway, not English native, etc...\n\nHi everyone! I (24M) met Jane (26F) a week ago in a dating app. We went on our first day for dinner and some drinks, and we had a great time. We ended the night with a kiss and promised to date again.\n\nLast saturday we met again for lunch. While we were eating she told me that she wanted to watch Barbie, so I offered to go there in the afternoon, and then go to a local pub with live music I love. She agreed and seems happy with the idea.\n\nAfter lunch we opened the cinema app to buy the tickets, and there were two hours, one at 16:00 and another at 17:50. She said we should go to the first one, but I said that I prefer the second one, as I want to go quickly to my home to feed my cat, change its water and clean the litter box. I wasn't able to stop by home this morning (stayed with some relatives), so I was feeling a bit worried, and I'll just feel better after checking everything is ok. My home is not far, but there is not enough time to go there and then go to the cinema for the first pass. She got upset and said that the cat will be fine. I said that probably she is right, but I prefer to be sure and, if she wants, she can come in, meet my cat, and have a drink and some cookies I bought yesterday while we make some time.\n\nApparently she took offense of what I said, and told me if I'm some kind of weirdo that believes my cat is my child. I told them no, but it's a living being and I just want to be sure it's ok. She shouted that she does not want to \"meet my cat\", and I answered that is not necessary, she can just wait me outside and it will not be more that a few minutes. Then she told me I just don't get it and she will not be with someone as immature as me. Then she leave and blocked me on her social media.\n\nHonestly I have no idea how I can be the asshole here, but I am a shy person and I have never been good socialising, much less dating, so I'm not sure if I did something inappropriate.

She may want more time to get to know you before she\u2019s in a non-public area.  The cat \u201cissue\u201d may have been her way of avoiding a secondary location with you.\n\nIf it happens again (what are the chances?) I\u2019d suggest you find a cool bookstore/park/coffee shop and ask your date if she can wait there for 30 mins while you check your cat.  If she wants to see your place she may ask but otherwise giving her a safe spot to wait-provided she was willing to-would have been a better route.", "NTA\n\nHer reaction was way over the top and is probably a sign of things to come if you carried on the relationship.  \n\nCats are very independent and are happy to be left alone for long periods.  What isn't fair on them is to leave them with no food and nowhere to go to the toilet.  What you were doing was caring for your cat in a totally normal way.", "NTA. \nShe got offended and upset because you were being a responsible pet owner? You have all the right to prioritize your cat over someone you met A WEEK AGO and if she's upset then that's her problem. It's probably good you got away from that, she sounds controlling.", "When I read the title of your post my first thought was oh no, this is someone who is way to attached to his cat.  And I am very nearly a crazy cat lady so that is saying something.  But when I read the post it became very clear that you were not wrong in the slightest.  You had been away from home over night and wasn't planning on being gone all day so you wouldn't have made preparations for an extended time away from your cat.  It was very responsible of you to want to take care of your pet properly.  Her reaction was way over the top and you dodged a bullet on this one.  \n\nYou are NTA but you forgot to pay the [cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/TWZbkMu.jpg)!", "NTA. \n\nPeople who freak out thinking \"you love your animal like a human child\" are typically looking for reasons to limit the scope of their empathy. Finding someone who loves their pet intensely should be a great green flag. \n\nHer loss.", "NTA, you dodged the worst kind of bullet. You can tell a lot about people by how they treat animals. Would have been the greenest of flag to me. Find yourself a nice cat lady instead of this self-centered AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty normal in my circle who want to meet each other\u2019s pets. Because pets are cute and adorable and fuzzy. Also we understand that living creatures need food. Good news is you found out right away that she\u2019s not the kind of person who values animals which could pose a problem down the road if things got serious and she decided she didn\u2019t want to live with a cat. Also she\u2019s clearly someone who isn\u2019t flexible and throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get her way. You keep taking care of that cat and doing you. Nothing you said or asked was unreasonable.", "NTA.. You were out overnight and only wanted to be a responsible pet owner. Her repsonse to that was weird. You dodged a bullet", "NTA - she\u2019s a whack a doodle.", "NTA Geez, what is wrong with her? You have to check in on an animal and FEED it. Honestly, you likely have dodged a bullet, what kind of person doesn't understand needing to feed a living animal?", "NTA lol the cat sounds like better company anyways", "NTA - If she's that upset about you caring for your cat, she is not a compatible match for you. She's upset about a freaking cat and calling you a weirdo because of it. You're not weird for wanting to make sure your cat is ok after almost 24 hours of not being home. She's being weird for being so upset about it and going off about the idea of you thinking your cat is your child. You're fine, she's the one in the wrong and you got lucky that she showed her true colours early on.", "NTA. Not even a little bit.\n\nI had to put down one of my cats this January (bone cancer in his jaw) and he was diabetic. He had to have meals and his insulin at specific times. I've left game nights at friends houses early to make sure he got what he needed. I've cancelled trips when I couldn't find a cat sitter. No one in my circle has criticized me for it any way.\n\nTake care of your cat, OP. They need interaction, affection and a schedule as much as any dog.", "NTA and you learned the valuable knowledge that she\u2019s not a good fit for you because you take responsibility toward dependent living creatures differently. \n\nNeither of you are wrong. But you should do more dates with people who are happy to meet your cat and who understand when you prioritize making sure the living creature you take care of is well taken care of.", "Nta.  The only rational explanation I can think of is that she didn't want to go to your place.  But if that was the case, what she said about being  immature is weird.  And probably said too much against the cat.  It's weird.", "NTA, you sounds actually mature, as you care for someone (in this case the cat), who you are responsible for. You were reasonably concerned about your cat, as you spent the night somewhere else. Of course, by better planning it would be not happen, but she suggested the film spontaneously also. She is a YTA, as she humiliated just normal concern and declined any alternative. If she didn\u2019t like cats, she could wait outside or suggest another alternative e.g. to meet in the cinema and do something else alone.", "NTA she sounds kinda unhinged. It would be different if you hadn't been away from home the night before.", "NTA. She sounds unhinged. Good on you for caring for your kitty.", "NTA. \n\nShe cares more about going to a movie than what you were worried about, think you dodged a bullet there. Although the cat would be okay tbh, but it\u2019s not a good look from her it would take what 10 mins to run in quick sort it out then leave it\u2019s not a problem and you were just worried. If you guys were to continue dating then she would eventually meet and go around yours anyway her plan was to probably leave after the movie seems like that\u2019s all she cared about anyway was going to the barbie movie with someone.", "I\u2019m so confused right now. What the fuck was her problem? You\u2019re NTA. She\u2019s immature as hell.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with caring about your pet and everything wrong with her reaction to it. She sounds selfish; callous and frankly insufferable. This is a huge red flag so I'd advise you to drop her asap.", "Can't believe this happened to you, but definitely NTA.\n\nYou were still able and willing to go see the movie, and you had time to go and check on your pet (aka your RESPONSIBILITY) with no penalty to your date. The fact that she blocked you seems like overkill; I read her whole demeanor as '*nothing should ever take precedence over me, my wants, my needs*,' which is a huge red flag.", "NTA your cat saved you from that cold heart Biiiiiiiiiiip", "INFO: when you met for lunch, did you drive together? I can understand her being upset if not coming with you would have meant being stranded somewhere. If she drove herself, then NTA.", "NTA, taking care of your pets is a priority", "NTA, you dodged a bullet.", "100% NTA.  There are definitely a couple of dodgy replies in here that she could look into dating though.", "NTA, possibly she thought that it was a way to get her to come to your place, but that happened so far into the whole situation it seems less likely. Think it might be for the best though, you aren\u2019t going to stop caring about your cat and she obviously has an issue with that.", "NTA but also WTF. What is her issue? Run dude.", "NTA, you seem like a responsible and loving pet owner and there was nothing wrong with your suggestion. You probably dodged a bullet with this one : you'd have been miserable with somebody who doesn't understand that pets are family.", "NTA - sounds like you were being a responsible pet owner. If the relationship continued, how long until she would insist you get rid of the cat?", "\"Lets go to my place.\" On the second date. And the reason you gave is that you need to change your cat's litter box. \n\nShe might not see going to your place as a second date activity. She might think that you should plan ahead and care for the cat before hand. Watching you change the litter box might not be as much fun for her as you think.\n\nI have to go with YTA. Whether you are clueless, unthinking or way too into your cat, it still comes out, at least a little bit, on the TA side.", "NTA I think what happened here is that your date interpreted your desire to check in on your cat as a ploy to get her to your apartment where, presumably you\u2019d hook up. I know you\u2019re coming from a place of care for your pet and you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. But, I\u2019ve heard every lame excuse under the sun as an attempt for sexytime, and I\u2019d probably not believe you at first, either. I guess maybe for future reference, share that you have a cat right away, and that if plans change on the fly, sometimes you\u2019ll have to hit pause to make sure kitty is looked after.", "NTA.  Consider  yourself lucky that you found out what she's really like on the second date.", "I understand that you care about your cat. You're saying that it'll be a recurring thing where every decision will have to be scheduled around your cat. Perfectly reasonable on your end. Still, I would have left the date at that point as well.\n\nFrom her perspective, on top of what she said, she also had no way of knowing that you weren't just trying to trick her into your home when she doesn't know you.\n\nYTA. Not for prioritizing your cat, of course, but that you're trying to make it a problem with her that she doesn't want that relationship.", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t say your an asshole YET but I get why she\u2019s pissed. It\u2019s possible that this showed her (in her mind anyway) you are not good at pre planning and lack time management skills. You wanted to stop a date midway for your pet, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing but shows you have no \u201cback up plan\u201d. \n\nWhich also begs the question since you do have a pet, will this be reoccurring thing? Do you plan on every date having a curfew so you can get home to feed the cat? Will you stop other outings midway for your pet over other non emergencies? \n\nIf you can\u2019t commit to an afternoon and evening with her, how are you gonna commit to like a weekend trip or something down the road, let alone an entire relationship? I can see why she made the decision that this relationship was not for her. \n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re just not compatible. You\u2019re not an ah for loving and providing for you cat whenever you can. However she not an AH either for no longer wanted to proceed with the relationship. If she wanted her social/date life to revolve completely around a pet she would get one herself.", "She\u2019s the AH.", "Wait, wait, wait. Info please: did you actually say \"*while we make some time*\" to her? If you did, then this is not about the cat.", "Sounds like some serious insecurity and crazy jealousy and controlling behavior down the line. Don't ignore red flags", "YTA... Cats by nature are independent creatures. You could have gone and it would have been fine for a few hours.", "NAH. You just have different priorities, though I'm not crazy about the way she communicated hers.  I love it that my friends have pets they're committed to taking care of, but I don't love that everything they do revolves around the pet.  We plan to hike a new trail the forest preserve built, but when we meet there we can't do it because it has steps the dog can't climb and she won't go anywhere without the dog.  We can't attend an art fair the next town over because he can't leave the cat long enough to go.  A couple refuses to come to my house for a party because a family member has a dog allergy and I won't allow them to bring their four dogs.  Which is all totally fine, but what's NOT fine is a pet owner making the other person the bad guy for not liking the inconvenience or inability to participate.

But if he has a pet, it will be recurring. *Everyone* with a pet has to make schedule decisions around their pets. It's part of the responsibility you sign up for when you get a pet.

That's not his fault.", "And that's fine if that's her dealbreaker, but she didn't need to be so rude about it. She went way too far with how she reacted.

What's your point?", "No, I wouldn't get angry (which is where she overreacted). But if they suggested I go with them and they said the reason was that they had to feed their cat, I would end the date, too. Mostly because I wouldn't trust them.", "Uh..yeah!

There's no way that could backfire, right?\n\nRidiculous.", "It is if you actually like the person.\n\nAlso the conflict here isn't her changing her mind, the conflict here is her having a go at him for caring about his cat.", "Or...\"I don't know you that well yet so I don't feel comfortable going to your house\". Funnily enough, that works fine.\n\nThat's a lot more reasonable than acting like you're jealous of a cat.\n\nYou keep trying to make out she was scared for her safety despite the fact they were in a public place and she was the one verbally attacking him.", "If I even suspected that someone was trying to trick me into their home on a first or second date, it wouldn't matter how much I liked them. I'd leave - which would be the \"more sensible\" option. But that's not related to the post here.\n\nI understand what the conflict is. What's your point? I've expressed that I disagree with your assessment of her being an AH for it.", "No, you're not reading the context of it.\n\nYou said that she should be able to say that, and I replied that's ridiculous.\n\n>Or...\"I don't know you that well yet so I don't feel comfortable going to your house\". Funnily enough, that works fine.\n\nUh, no. That's if you're mildly uncomfortable. Not if you're worried about your safety.\n\nI'm not saying she was, but that's the context of the hypothetical situation you're discussing.", "But you've said she overreacted.\n\nHer overreaction is the conflict.\n\nSo I'm genuinely confused how you can be \"what she did was wrong but she also isn't the AH here\"", "Is it?\n\nBecause all they said was \"Like no, she doesn\u2019t know him well enough to leave a public place and go to his house with him alone.\"\n\nThat doesn't suggest that she was worried for her safety during the actual conversation at all. Not being willing to go back to someone's house with them does not mean you're scared of them in the middle of a restaurant.\n\nYou're the one ignoring the context here. Stop projecting."]}
