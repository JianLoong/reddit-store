I dreaded going to my dad's house because my step mom treated me like shit. He knew but still forced me to come. Never stood up to her behavior.\n\nWhen I was four, I would constantly cry myself to sleep because I missed my mom. My dad used to read to me or tell me stories, or sit with me until I fell asleep. He never had an issue doing this until he met my step mom. She made him stop coming into my room to comfort me and from then on I was forced to cry it out. My dad had two house phones, so my mom told me to start calling her before bed so that she could talk to me until I fell asleep. Sometimes the phone would die, so I would go downstairs to grab the other. My step mom would complain and eventually I wasn't allowed to call my mom anymore.\n\nShe would get angry at my dad when he would take me places, spent alone time with me etc. She would ignore him the rest of the time I was there.\n\nFor one of my birthdays they took me out to eat and apparently I did not say thank you. She called my mom in front of me to tell her. My mom's like...she's six years old? Moreover, when my daughter is at my house, do I call you up on the phone to complain to you about what she's doing when she's with me, or ask for parenting advice? Did you want me to punish my six year old for not saying thank you?\n\nOne year my grandma gifted me a laptop and thought I finally had something to do to pass the time when I went to my dads. Well, you guessed it! My step mom would come take it from me at like 7pm. And the same thing when I got my first phone. It is clear that she was trying to deprive me of things to keep myself occupied. One day I actually sneakily recorded her screaming at me with my laptop so that I could show my mom and dad, but she looked through my computer and deleted it and then confronted/threatened me.\n\nShe used to lock their bedroom door during the day (I had no idea,) and when my dad confronted her she said she did not want me \"stealing\" her things. I had never stolen anything prior.\n\nAnyway, My dad and I have been attempting to \"repair\" the super damaged relationship that we have. I invite him to holidays, my birthday, etc. but he said that he \"feels guilty\" that he has to leave my step mom behind and wants me to invite her too. I told him ABSOLUTELY not, I did not have a choice in regards to being in her presence as a child and now that I finally have a choice in my adulthood, I do not want to be around her whatsoever. He says he understands but still asks me why I don't invite her places.\n\nThe relationship I had with her, and with him have both had a term effect on my mental health and even play a part in my relationships with significant others and friendships. He thinks this is something we should move on from and start over. \n\nAITA for not inviting her places?

This is YOUR life and you're an adult and you get to choose who is and isn't a part of your life.\n\nIt's too bad your dad feels bad coming without her, but it's not your job to make him \"feel better\" about coming to your place without her.  Since you're both working together to repair the relationship, he should know how much his allowing her to walk all over you has affected not only you, but your relationship with him.", "NTA This is your stepmom\u2019s introduction to \u201cyou reap what you sow.\u201d Feel free to point out to your dad that he allowed her abuse for 15+ years. It\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t feel bad enough about his wife\u2019s treatment of you to do something about it. \n\nIf your stepmom wanted some kind of reconciliation, she would have apologized by now. Stepmom doesn\u2019t care about being excluded, and your dad shouldn\u2019t, either.", "At this stage I don't even understand why you want a relationship with HIM. You realize he hasn't changed, right? He's still trying to hand wave the damage they both caused and is still trying to guilt you into letting her back into your life.\n\nThe only thing that has changed is his ability to force you to be in her presence since you're no longer a minor, and that's what he's slowly working on right now. Be prepared for him to just bring her one day anyway and spring her on you, claiming he 'just wants his family back'.\n\nNTA. Neither has apologized and he is still trying to manipulate you into spending time with your abuser, and to be frank his neglect and spinelessness makes him one of your abusers too. They're both toxic. \n\nYou're a bigger person than me because I would have cut him off the minute he started trying to guilt trip you into seeing the abusive, cruel AH he forced you to live with. The fact that no apology from her is forthcoming is a pretty good indicator that she's going to be just as nasty and cruel to you now. Don't invite her to do anything other than take a long walk off a short pier, and at this stage, he can jump with her.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  Does your dad even realize that she's the reason you need reconciliation in the first place? Bringing her along would be like trying to take an antidote that has some poison mixed in it.", "Awful. Your dad let you down.\n\nStand firm. Adult who abuse children realize when the children grow up that they are abused will become public knowledge. And they do not like that one bit. You call her out and tell your father absolutely not. He allowed this woman to abuse you. You owe him nothin", "Sounds like she deserves to not be invited to be a part of your life", "NTA and I have no idea why you\u2019re still inviting him when he still complains about his abuser wife\u2019s absence.

It's reasonable for you to choose not to invite your stepmom to events, given the history and the impact it has had on your mental health. Your healing process is a personal journey, and it's okay to take the time and space you need.", "NTA- Your dad had the chance to make things right when you were younger. However, he CHOSE to ignore you and how she treated you. Now that you are grown, He again is ignoring you it is time that he realizes the problem which is himself. If he would have stepped up when you were younger then none of this would be an issue.", "NTA If your dad is so willing to allow her to treat you like dirt, you should consider letting him go. There's no reason to continue dealing with toxic people and he's just as toxic as she is to your mental health.", "NTA-Stand your ground on not inviting that vile harpy. Sorry your dad is a gutless coward that never stands up for you. I personally wouldn\u2019t speak to him either.", "NTA", "Nta he did NOTHING to help you when you were a child. He FAFO and tough $h*t for \"poor\" stepmonster", "He did not protect a small child from abuse and yet wants you to forgive the abuser. No way no how, he is bloody lucky you are willing to give him a chance.", "He has cancer. I think this is what plays a big part in why I feel like I could potentially be an asshole for not just inviting her. For a long time, I didn't want a relationship with him and I made that clear and went no contact for almost two years. I feel extreme guilt if I don't at least try to work on our relationship now though. I don't know why. Thank you for your insight.", "We can't always explain our feelings, my dear. You're fine.\n\nIf he is ill and scared and wants to fix things with you before the worst happens, then his focus should be meeting you on your terms, and meeting you where you stand. If he really wants back into your life, if what he REALLY wants is a relationship with you, he has to understand that now isn't the time to continue to bulldoze your barriers. He didn't protect you when he should have...he has one more chance to do it now. \n\nStepmom and her feelings are irrelevant.\n\nIf he's running out of time...he shouldn't be wasting it. The ball is in his court, not yours. Don't feel guilty for protecting yourself."]}
