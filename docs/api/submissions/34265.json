I dreaded going to my dad's house because my step mom treated me like shit. He knew but still forced me to come. Never stood up to her behavior.\n\nWhen I was four, I would constantly cry myself to sleep because I missed my mom. My dad used to read to me or tell me stories, or sit with me until I fell asleep. He never had an issue doing this until he met my step mom. She made him stop coming into my room to comfort me and from then on I was forced to cry it out. My dad had two house phones, so my mom told me to start calling her before bed so that she could talk to me until I fell asleep. Sometimes the phone would die, so I would go downstairs to grab the other. My step mom would complain and eventually I wasn't allowed to call my mom anymore.\n\nShe would get angry at my dad when he would take me places, spent alone time with me etc. She would ignore him the rest of the time I was there.\n\nFor one of my birthdays they took me out to eat and apparently I did not say thank you. She called my mom in front of me to tell her. My mom's like...she's six years old? Moreover, when my daughter is at my house, do I call you up on the phone to complain to you about what she's doing when she's with me, or ask for parenting advice? Did you want me to punish my six year old for not saying thank you?\n\nOne year my grandma gifted me a laptop and thought I finally had something to do to pass the time when I went to my dads. Well, you guessed it! My step mom would come take it from me at like 7pm. And the same thing when I got my first phone. It is clear that she was trying to deprive me of things to keep myself occupied. One day I actually sneakily recorded her screaming at me with my laptop so that I could show my mom and dad, but she looked through my computer and deleted it and then confronted/threatened me.\n\nShe used to lock their bedroom door during the day (I had no idea,) and when my dad confronted her she said she did not want me \"stealing\" her things. I had never stolen anything prior.\n\nAnyway, My dad and I have been attempting to \"repair\" the super damaged relationship that we have. I invite him to holidays, my birthday, etc. but he said that he \"feels guilty\" that he has to leave my step mom behind and wants me to invite her too. I told him ABSOLUTELY not, I did not have a choice in regards to being in her presence as a child and now that I finally have a choice in my adulthood, I do not want to be around her whatsoever. He says he understands but still asks me why I don't invite her places.\n\nThe relationship I had with her, and with him have both had a term effect on my mental health and even play a part in my relationships with significant others and friendships. He thinks this is something we should move on from and start over. \n\nAITA for not inviting her places?

Since you're both working together to repair the relationship, he should know how much his allowing her to walk all over you has affected not only you, but your relationship with him.", "NTA This is your stepmom\u2019s introduction to \u201cyou reap what you sow.\u201d Feel free to point out to your dad that he allowed her abuse for 15+ years. It\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t feel bad enough about his wife\u2019s treatment of you to do something about it. \n\nIf your stepmom wanted some kind of reconciliation, she would have apologized by now. Stepmom doesn\u2019t care about being excluded, and your dad shouldn\u2019t, either.", "At this stage I don't even understand why you want a relationship with HIM. You realize he hasn't changed, right? He's still trying to hand wave the damage they both caused and is still trying to guilt you into letting her back into your life.\n\nThe only thing that has changed is his ability to force you to be in her presence since you're no longer a minor, and that's what he's slowly working on right now. Be prepared for him to just bring her one day anyway and spring her on you, claiming he 'just wants his family back'.\n\nNTA. Neither has apologized and he is still trying to manipulate you into spending time with your abuser, and to be frank his neglect and spinelessness makes him one of your abusers too. They're both toxic. \n\nYou're a bigger person than me because I would have cut him off the minute he started trying to guilt trip you into seeing the abusive, cruel AH he forced you to live with. The fact that no apology from her is forthcoming is a pretty good indicator that she's going to be just as nasty and cruel to you now. Don't invite her to do anything other than take a long walk off a short pier, and at this stage, he can jump with her.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  Does your dad even realize that she's the reason you need reconciliation in the first place? Bringing her along would be like trying to take an antidote that has some poison mixed in it.", "Awful. Your dad let you down.\n\nStand firm. Adult who abuse children realize when the children grow up that they are abused will become public knowledge. And they do not like that one bit.

It's reasonable for you to choose not to invite your stepmom to events, given the history and the impact it has had on your mental health. Your healing process is a personal journey, and it's okay to take the time and space you need.", "NTA- Your dad had the chance to make things right when you were younger. However, he CHOSE to ignore you and how she treated you. Now that you are grown, He again is ignoring you it is time that he realizes the problem which is himself. If he would have stepped up when you were younger then none of this would be an issue.", "NTA If your dad is so willing to allow her to treat you like dirt, you should consider letting him go. There's no reason to continue dealing with toxic people and he's just as toxic as she is to your mental health.", "NTA-Stand your ground on not inviting that vile harpy. Sorry your dad is a gutless coward that never stands up for you. I personally wouldn\u2019t speak to him either.", "NTA", "Nta he did NOTHING to help you when you were a child. He FAFO and tough $h*t for \"poor\" stepmonster", "He did not protect a small child from abuse and yet wants you to forgive the abuser. No way no how, he is bloody lucky you are willing to give him a chance.", "He has cancer. I think this is what plays a big part in why I feel like I could potentially be an asshole for not just inviting her. For a long time, I didn't want a relationship with him and I made that clear and went no contact for almost two years. I feel extreme guilt if I don't at least try to work on our relationship now though. I don't know why. Thank you for your insight.", "We can't always explain our feelings, my dear. You're fine.\n\nIf he is ill and scared and wants to fix things with you before the worst happens, then his focus should be meeting you on your terms, and meeting you where you stand. If he really wants back into your life, if what he REALLY wants is a relationship with you, he has to understand that now isn't the time to continue to bulldoze your barriers. He didn't protect you when he should have...he has one more chance to do it now. \n\nStepmom and her feelings are irrelevant.\n\nIf he's running out of time...he shouldn't be wasting it. The ball is in his court, not yours. Don't feel guilty for protecting yourself.", "NTA - he is still putting her first if he won't drop this.  You have a choice now - tell him to stop bringing it up, enforce a boundary if he does, or capitulate to his demand/guilting you into inviting step-mom.  This is hard stuff, I hope you have a trusted therapist to work this through with.  And I'm sorry your dad is still being so selfish.", "Does your stepmom seriously want to come? I mean did you ever confront your dad or her on her abusive treatment of you?", "NTA\n\nOh look she\u2019s facing the consequences of her own actions.\n\nAnd where was dad when your step mother was terrorizing a child? He should probably consider himself lucky that you\u2019re inviting him.", "NTA. Your boundaries are valid and even if your dad may not like it, he should respect them.", "Now that I have a choice, I don't invite or even speak to my stepmother.\n\nI guess they never stopped to think what would happen when we grew up ?\n\nNTA", "NTA - but your Dad sucks big time. Tell him to get over the fact you aren\u2019t inviting your childhood tormentor to anything. And, if he truly wants a relationship with you then this is the last time you are willing to discuss it.", "Your father let his new wife abuse you for years.  He's complicit in that abuse.  \n\nWhy.  The Fuck.  Are you trying to repair your relationship with someone who still prioritizes your abuser over you?  \n\nNTA, but you're kinda being an asshole to yourself.  He can't do these things and claim to love you.  Of course he wants you to move on from the abuse you suffered.  That would mean he doesn't have to change or accept accountability for being a shitty dad who was more interested in getting laid than protecting his daughter in his own house.  \n\nMy father was also a nutless wonder who stood idly by as his series of wives abused his children.  I haven't spoken to him in more than 20 years.  Sooner or later you're going to have to decide how much of this you are willing to take.  A lot of people don't seem to realize going no contact is even an option.  Or, if they do realize it, they seem to be unable to follow through with it even though their family is demonstrably affecting their health.  \n\nBe kind to yourself.", "NTA.  You do not have to have a relationship with your abuser.  Period.", "NTA.  You are doing exactly as you should - setting boundaries and protecting your emotional and mental well being from someone who treated you horribly.", "NTA - You get to choose who's in your life. And if he wants to mend that relationship he will agree and stop guilting you for making decisions as an adult.", "> He says he understands but still asks me why I don't invite her places.\n\nIn other words, your dad still turns a blind eye to the abuse you suffered that he enabled.\n\nSo when you say,\n\n> My dad and I have been attempting to \"repair\" the super damaged relationship\n\n... it sure doesn't sound like he's doing much of an attempt.\n\nNTA.", ">*it's not your job to make him \"feel better\" about coming to your place without her.* \n\nI'd add: it was **his job** to defend OP against the wicked stepmother's actions when she was little, but he didn't.\n\nNTA\n\nHe can just shut up and accept it, like he just accepted his wife's treatment of his daughter...", "I was going to ask OP if her stepmother has even expressed any desire to be included (either directly or vis-a-vis OP\u2019s dad), because it doesn\u2019t sound like it. If OP doesn\u2019t want her there, and stepmom doesn\u2019t care either way, then why is the dad trying to force the issue?", "I don't know if she actually wants to come or if he just wants me to extend the invite even if she says no. I don't know if she went to him specifically asking why I never invite her. They have an 18 year old son, my half brother, that I invite as well. So it's blatantly obvious that I am intentionally leaving her out. I did have several discussions with my dad over the years and he has apologized profusely, but obviously that does not erase everything that he let slide in the past and the emotional damage this has caused me. Additionally, I have not received a single apology from her for her behavior in my life - at this point it wouldn't even make a difference. All I know is that my dad has cancer now, and I'm sincerely going back and forth with myself on whether or not burying the hatchet is necessary. I want to include him even though he's an AH for letting it all happen, but I still love him anyway because he's my dad.", "And also-fuck your stepmom. I\u2019m so sorry you had to grow up with such an awful person.", "I haven't talked to mine since I turned 18 and it was my choice to stop going to his house. She's still coming back to bite me in the ass, somehow.", "If he is driving the relationship-mending I would be honest with him and tell him that you do not and will not ever want a relationship with her.  That you are willing to work on a relationship with him as he has cancer but that if he pushes you to include her, you will have to take a break again (if this is how you feel).  Whatever you do, protect your mental health.  If that means letting go of this relationship, do that.  You owe him nothing.  I hope you have a trusted person to work this through with.  Hugs.", "Well maybe ask your dad first which is it. Either way, she must know that you don't like her, and the reasons why. And if your dad seriously expects you to move on, she can try offering an apology first.", "Well, her lack of apology does give you a place to start. Even if it wouldn\u2019t really mean much to you at this point, you can tell your dad that a sincere apology from her is the bare minimum before you\u2019d even consider inviting her to anything. She\u2019ll almost certainly refuse, at which point the ball\u2019s in her court and you can\u2019t be guilt-tripped.", "Thank you. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. She is so shitty.", "Thank you so much for your kind words. My mom has been my saving grace throughout my entire life for this exact reason. She lets me talk and she listens. It doesn't fix everything, but it certainly helps. She hates my step mom and can hardly stand my dad for what they made me go through. She is my angel through and through. As for my dad, I love him even though he put me in such a terrible position. Even before I learned of his cancer I longed for a proper relationship with him as I felt I never had a *true* father figure. The cancer only makes things worse as I feel extreme guilt for some reason. I know my dad loves me, but clearly not as much as someone should love their kid. I don't even have kids and I know I could never be with someone who treated my kids like that. Mind boggling.", "I\u2019m also so impressed that you are working towards forgiveness with your dad, that takes a level of strength I don\u2019t think I have. Sending so much love-I know the holidays are an extra hard time and those extra stressors could probably still there for you.", "I am SO glad you have your mom!  I can tell she was a good mom because you know your dad is not being a proper parent.  And I'm sorry your dad can't be the parent you deserve but please do not feel guilt!  I hope you can tap into a support group or therapy as you navigate this - only you will know if standing up for yourself now is the right thing in the face of the cancer and your feelings about your father.  Wishing you so much luck as you navigate.", "I get it from my mom, unfortunately. No matter what I do, it still weighs on my mind. I still feel guilt. Thank you. The holidays do not help.", "Thank you so much. I can tell from your username and thoughts/opinions (and maybe a little bit of stalking your reddit :) ) that you are a great mom, too. I know that I've needed to for quite some time, but I am definitely going to seek therapy. ASAP.", "Glad to help!  And thank you - I do my best (and it is really eye-opening and heart-breaking to see some of the parent/child situations on reddit).  I hope you find someone wonderful to help you navigate this hard situation.\n\nps my kids make fun of me for being on reddit (my guilty pleasure!)"]}
