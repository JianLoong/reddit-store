{"id": 1436, "submission_id": "ymdtkw", "title": "AITA for expecting my husband to take care of the household if my job pays more?", "selftext": "My husband has an entry level office job. I work as a developer remotely. He makes around 50k a year and I make around 200k. \n\nWhen we got married I had just graduated college and was unemployed for 3 months until I found a job. He financially supported us. We\u2019ve always shared a bank account since we were young and I don\u2019t believe he ever had expectations of me to make money. I have always wanted him to improve his life and be able to support himself and become financially independent. I encouraged him to get his degree and he started and dropped out at least 3 or 4 times. Eventually he got an entry level office job. I gradually worked to get where I am and it was extremely hard. I\u2019ve had times where Ive stayed up all night working to meet deadlines. Not everyday, week, or month is hard. But my job is not like his 9-5 job. If I have to work\u2026 I have to work. And I\u2019m the only developer. I don\u2019t have a lifeline or a buddy. I have to figure it out, or\u2026 else it doesn\u2019t get done.\n\nWith our money we have been able to improve our lives. We moved out of our apartment full of cockroaches into a nicer one. We were able to pay for a life saving surgery for our dog.\n\nOne things I don\u2019t have is balance. Our house is a shit show. He often takes sick days to sleep all day (something I generally cannot do as there is not additional staff). I can\u2019t imagine taking days off and not cleaning anything when the house is in bad shape. He doesn\u2019t clean up after himself or do the dishes or cook really. If he does cook he leaves everything out. He is a first generation American and I know for a fact with his culture and family that he didn\u2019t grow up taking care of himself, someone did it for him.\n\nHe will do things like if I ask him to take out the trash he will but generally he doesn\u2019t. Lately I have been feeling really resentful. He continuously comes home talking about what a hard day he had and how tired he is. I think he thinks because I work at home I don\u2019t work hard. And when I\u2019m at home I\u2019m left to deal with household stuff when he isn\u2019t around. I feel like we both should be making my job the priority and he should be helping enable me to succeed with my daily life. I feel like I only work at my high paid job to help us and not because I want to. I could easily find a job that pays half with little stress and live with a roommate who cleans.\n\nI got a suitcase out to leave last weekend, but shocker, I had so much work that I decided to stay. The drive to my parents house is 8 hours and I just didn\u2019t have time. He was pissed and said I was being so mean and putting him down. He says he thinks I\u2019m better than him because I make more money. If I cared about money I would\u2019ve left a long time ago. I just want him to help take care of us.\n\nI don\u2019t believe his job is hard, but I do understand it maybe hard for him. Either way I feel like if I was making less and he was making more I would try to help him at home to make his life easier. I still try to do those things for him when I do have time. In my head, in a perfect world, my house would be spotless and he would take care of a lot of it. Am I the asshole for expecting him to take care of our house because I think my job is more important?", "created_utc": 1667604484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymdtkw/aita_for_expecting_my_husband_to_take_care_of_the/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
