I don\u2019t want my pic taken. Why are you discreetly taking pics on your insta story of me? It\u2019s weird. Aside from that we have \u2018nice\u2019 looking pics when I have makeup on hair done etc. and I see ALL the pics and the ones she has edited aren\u2019t the best angle of me.

There are lots of reasons we look different in photos than in real life, some people tend to look better and some tend to look worse. Science tells us that, without consciously realizing it, when we look at ourselves in the mirror, we angle our faces at more flattering positions.\n\nSo there is a chance that OP is very accustomed to seeing her face in the mirror held in a certain pose, and it's jarring to see herself in other poses.\n\nAnd there is a chance that SIL doesn't see anything wrong with the pics she takes, because she is accustomed to seeing OP at all angles.", "maybe.. but also I feel it's narcissistic of me to say she is jealous of me. so maybe I am the ah", "It would def not be behind her back.

I didn't know you were taking photos of me and I don't like having my picture taken without permission. Ask me before uploading any photos of me\"", "Actually, I think that's a good reason, by itself, to not hire her.  She pulls this shit and knows you don't like it.  Why would you reward someone like that with your business?", "Don\u2019t be passive aggressive,  if you want to use someone else book them instead.

You are in the right on that. But she might just really not know that this bothers you. If she does know that and continues to do it, then she would definitely be a jerk for it. But that's a quick convo of you letting her know your boundaries.", "I'm not saying the post has anything to do with your husband.

Idk I\u2019m petty", "Nope.  Adults shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells around someone.  And your SO should have your back. She is being a bully and you should put a stop to it.

If your husband thinks the professional pictures look great, then there's also a good chance that the pictures are fine, and at slightly more natural angles. That doesn't mean you have to use her as your professional photographer going forward, but it's necessary information to judge whether you're being paranoid, like many others suggested.", "I see what you are saying\u2026 and I hear you,. But Here\u2019s the thing.. It\u2019s not about my husband. Idc. \n\nWhat I care about is, are their ulterior motives with my SIL? And ATA for switching up.", "So he prefers you natural and loves the photos? But if you admit that, then you feel like it'll fuel the idea that you're overreacting to photos where you look natural?\n\n> are their ulterior motives with my SIL?\n\nIf I'm correct above, then the answer to this is probably no. \n\nWhich means it's a NAH situation. She's not an AH for seeing the beauty in you without make up or at a natural angle. She shouldn't be your photographer if you don't like that style. So you're not an AH for hiring someone else. \n\nBut you seem at risk of AH behaviour if you bring this up with the SIL. I fear that you would say far too much of what you think, rather than just politely asking her not to post photos of you without your permission, as you feel uncomfortable when not wearing makeup/controlling your online image.", "OP already stated it is her personal dissatisfaction with the photos that is bothering her so husbands opinion doesnt matter. He could keep the natural photos for himself to admire. If you've read her other comments then you know she has already told her SIL she doesn't like the photos, not to post them, etc. OP also said she's overly nice about it and in another comment stated that even when she does bring it up her SIL overreacts about it. Her SIL can \"see the beauty\" in her natural looks and also not post her on stories without permission."]}
