Your mother is really toxic, I'm sorry. Also other family members sounds no different.   \n\n\nNTA, would be better for you if you put strict boundaries with the whole family. By the way, conguratulations on your journey !", "NTA\nWhat is wrong with your mother as well as her family.  I'm sure many people give the same advice in these situations but it's better you work on getting out of there once you're able to.  Yes life will be a bit more difficult financially but what you said is right she does see you as competition and not as her daughter, cause no good mother would tear down her child.", "I think you need to cut her out of your life if you can", "absolutely NTA, your mother is a major AH", "Info: how were you 18 78 days ago but are now 17?", "NTA.

Consider getting a professional to talk to, (that really helped my partner) good luck", "NTA\n\nBut it wasn't her surgery that messed things up.

Also not the surgery ruined your life she did.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is the way she is because of her issues. It has nothing to do with you. There is nothing you could have said or done to make this work. You have reach adulthood despite a toxic parent relationship, so congratulations, well done.\n\nYou will take a while to recover from all of this. Your dysmorphia for example. You will probably assume other people are more judgmental and persecutory than they are. Your bf sounds like a good guy, and make new friends in uni. Try not to interact with your mother as much as you can, don't tell her how you are doing (called \"Grey Rocking\" - you try to be as uninteresting to her as possible and give her no details to use against you), and keep whatever clothing you can out of her reach. Eventually you will be free, and your life will be better.\n\nThere's other threads where you can get support for this sort of thing.", "It just sounds you have other problems than this specific encounter. \n\nThere's an underlying disgust or hate for each other as far as I can tell.

You have done so much to work on yourself. Just remember she is still stuck in that pit of misery, don't let her pull you back into it.
