The surgery isn't a miracle and your mom is a jerk, but in the sense of what comes to the surgery you also weren't really in the right. My mom underwent bariatric surgery around the time I was exercising and dieting for weight loss and, as much as I encouraged her to eat similarly to me, it was always more about making habits than shaming her for \"going the easy path\". \n\nAlso, how do you want someone with mobility problems to lose weight naturally? Bariatric surgery exists precisely for people with such issues. The body would get hurt from intense exercise to burn the calories while supporting its weight without the proper musculature, and just dieting is a very inefficient way to lose weight when you're a full grown adult. She'd have to eat very miserably to be in a caloric d\u00e9ficit without exercise.\n\nLastly, your mom is a jerk who will victimize herself by framing every inconvenience to her wants as some sort of conspiracy.
