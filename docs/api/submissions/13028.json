We\u2019re LDS, so we\u2019re having a temple marriage. However, we will be having a wedding reception for those who are unable to attend the actual wedding. \n\nMy family is very religious and we all follow the teachings of the church very closely, so a few years when my sister came out as lesbians my family had a huge problem with it. I never really cared because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my place to judge anyone. My sister was 17 when a family friend told my parents that they saw her *kissing* another girl at a homecoming dance. This caused my parents to lash out at her, and it really put a strain on their relationship. Right after my sister graduated she moved out, and moved into an apartment with her friend she was kissing at homecoming. She stopped talking to our family for 3 years, but recently we got back in touch when I invited her to my wedding. \n\nMy sister (21F) was thrilled for me, but she said she was unsure if she would be in attendance. I begged her and told her this could be the start of our family healing. We have three other siblings who also don\u2019t speak with my sister, and she expressed how much she misses them. She told me she would think about it and get back to me. \n\nMy sister and I started talking more and more, and comes to find out she\u2019s also engaged to her friend from homecoming! When I ask her if she\u2019s thought about if she wants to come to the wedding reception she says she\u2019ll be more than happy to *if* she can bring her friend. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy that my sister is happy, but I feel like her bringing her friend will take the attention off my fianc\u00e9 and me. I express my feeling that I don\u2019t really like the idea, and she tells me that if she can\u2019t bring her friend she\u2019s not comfortable coming to my wedding. I feel like this is completely unfair because this day is about me and my husband. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I being an assh*le? Should I drop it and allow her to bring her friend to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1679603965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zwlui/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_bring_her_friend/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We\u2019re LDS, so we\u2019re having a temple marriage. However, we will be having a wedding reception for those who are unable to attend the actual wedding. \n\nMy family is very religious and we all follow the teachings of the church very closely, so a few years when my sister came out as lesbians my family had a huge problem with it. I never really cared because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my place to judge anyone. My sister was 17 when a family friend told my parents that they saw her *kissing* another girl at a homecoming dance. This caused my parents to lash out at her, and it really put a strain on their relationship. Right after my sister graduated she moved out, and moved into an apartment with her friend she was kissing at homecoming. She stopped talking to our family for 3 years, but recently we got back in touch when I invited her to my wedding. \n\nMy sister (21F) was thrilled for me, but she said she was unsure if she would be in attendance. I begged her and told her this could be the start of our family healing. We have three other siblings who also don\u2019t speak with my sister, and she expressed how much she misses them. She told me she would think about it and get back to me. \n\nMy sister and I started talking more and more, and comes to find out she\u2019s also engaged to her friend from homecoming! When I ask her if she\u2019s thought about if she wants to come to the wedding reception she says she\u2019ll be more than happy to *if* she can bring her friend. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy that my sister is happy, but I feel like her bringing her friend will take the attention off my fianc\u00e9 and me. I express my feeling that I don\u2019t really like the idea, and she tells me that if she can\u2019t bring her friend she\u2019s not comfortable coming to my wedding. I feel like this is completely unfair because this day is about me and my husband. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I being an assh*le? Should I drop it and allow her to bring her friend to my wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This also means having a BIG ADULT conversation with your parents and siblings with how you EXPECT them to treat your sister and her fiance.  If you can do that for your sister- physically show her that you're defending her and are on her side, you have a chance of rebuilding your relationship with her and you may even gain a new sister!\n\nBut, if you don't do that, and just hemhaw around dragging your feet because you don't want to cause waves before/on your wedding...  I think it's safe to say your sister shouldn't be in an area that will attack (verbal/emotional/etc) her for just being herself. If you're that concerned about your wedding then I think you should take your sister's condition and TELL YOUR SISTER that it'd be best for YOUR SISTER not to come to it as it wouldn't benefit you or the family during that time to have a family reunion.", "Yes, your sister will and her fianc\u00e9e will be talked about at your wedding by all the closed minded family members and friends. Are you having a bridal shower or rehearsal dinner or any gatherings before the wedding where you could invite your sister and your future SIL?  This way all the pearl clutching and gossiping will be over with by your big day and you can simultaneously show your sister that you love and support her.", "F you and rot in the ground with the rest of your homophobic family", "Well, maybe then the wedding itself isn\u2019t the time for everyone to meet your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9e for the first time? Y\u2019all love big family get-togethers, right? Sounds like before the wedding is a great time for one.", "F you", "I\u2019m just saying that you hardly knowing your sisters girlfriend is not an excuse because you don\u2019t know everyone invited. You don\u2019t want them there because them being lesbian will distract from you. That\u2019s the truth so don\u2019t try and downplay it as not knowing them", "It's the easiest thing in the world to just not type friend. But you have an internalized systemic homophobia from a lifetime of upbringing in a deeply homophobic church.\n\nIf you can't make this simplest of steps in an anonymous Internet forum you're a lot more homophobic than you think you are.", "Bruh, just change the word \"friend\" to \"fiance.\" It isn't that fucking hard. You don't see people calling your fiance just your \"friend\" do you?", "yeah because you\u2019re homophobic and in denial about it. YTA", "How the fuck is it \u201ca work in progress\u201d that makes no sense. You\u2019re either homophobic or you\u2019re not, there\u2019s no inbetween and you seem to believe you can have a good relationship with your sister being inbetween. That\u2019s not how it works. You either support her or you don\u2019t.", "Homophobe", "You clearly aren\u2019t even trying. It took me less than a day to use they/them for someone\u2019s pronouns the first time I worked with someone using those pronouns.", "This is kind of undermining your claim of never having been a homophobe...", "Dude...you can't even acknowledge your sister's relationship to strangers on the internet. You made the choice to type friend. That's homophobic and frankly not much progress. Your religion is hate. It sits and stews in toxicity and you participate in it. Once you accept the reality that you've chosen hate over your sister, maybe then you can make real progress to to get away from that hatred and homophobia that you actively participate in.", "Commandeer away.", "Then correct your comments and your post. You are all talk but no action.", "No, I\u2019m trying to say like what I don\u2019t agree with, so that\u2019s what I don\u2019t agree with because you were trying to ask me what OP may be wrong for in my opinion that is my opinion. Yes please stop wasting my time. Thanks and you\u2019re welcome I know you needed it.", "By rejecting her fiance, the person who she is choosing to spend the rest of her life with, you are rejecting her. The reason for her estrangement is being underlined by your redusal to invite her fiance. It continues the problem. It invalidates her relationship amd identity. You are asking her to choose you over her partner. I know you dont feel that way, but she does. Trust me. In her shoes i would (and have) walk away every time.", "So to be clear on this, you are getting married to someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with. And you want your sister there. But you don't want your sister to bring the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with. \n\nAnd you're wondering if she is the one who has changed and isn't being nice?", "Have you considered that the other family members only seem okay because they've dealt with it longer? This isn't about her not being selfless and kind, this is about you not wanting to be selfless and kind for her, for once. If she was engaged to a man, would you let her bring him?\n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t even call your sister\u2019s partner by the proper term and think she should \u201csacrifice\u201d for you and your teenage wedding? Stop!", "I get where you are coming from. I was raised super religious too, and finally came to my OWN conclusions. I suspect the idea of a family confrontation is making you uncomfortable and I GET that. But you need to understand how your sister feels. Imagine your fianc\u00e9e was black, and you were ostracized cause of it. Then you were told YOU could come to a family event, but your fianc\u00e9e can\u2019t, because everyone there dislikes black people and they don\u2019t want a scene.\n\nDo you see? It\u2019s about loving your sister AND HER PARTNER. I know it\u2019s hard to go against the stream, but she sounds like she is a wonderful person, don\u2019t lose that.", "Sacrifice what? The woman who truly loves her? For whom? The little sister talking like this is a test for big sis to \"prove\" to you something? Your \"one\" day that most likely would be her being berated by your \"loving\" religious family? Nah.  \n\n\nNo, wo way. She's selfless, you are selfish.   \n\n\nYou aren't even thinking of her happiness. Just her dancing for you and your family by giving up her happiness she deserves.", "Your sister is sacrificing so much more than you seem capable of conceiving by simply being around the bigots who disowned her\u2014 your wondering if her being unwilling to endure *further* disrespect and harm at the hands of the family who rejected her means she\u2019s *no longer selfless and kind* is completely lacking in empathy and awareness. what the actual f*ck", "It is actually wild how much you are twisting this around to be a victim. Sacrificed a day for her little sister? Girl, she\u2019s been cut off from your whole ass community because of the outdated homophobic beliefs that the church still subscribes too. If anyone is being selfless it is absolutely still her - willing to go with her partner to something where she knows everyone is judging her ? To support you? That is selflessness. She is trying to be there for you and literally the only thing she is asking for in return is to have her person, in her corner. I cannot imagine how isolating and devastating it was to lose her family because she is gay. To ask her to come back to that environment alone is actually really disgraceful. I know you are young and I know you are in deep with your religion but YTA for even asking that of her.", "award time!", "I don\u2019t agree with that teaching. They stopped that hateful rhetoric before I was born. If they were racist still, I wouldn\u2019t be a member. My fianc\u00e9 is hispanic.", "I don\u2019t believe that, but that\u2019s what the church believes", "Okay, thank you for your input. I will do some research on them!", "My fianc\u00e9 and I will both serve a mission together when we are older. The only reason he chose to miss out on a mission young is because of personal family reasons.", "It's also not going to end here. If family isn't comfortable with the sister bringing her soon-to-be wife to the ceremony, where else is she going to be unwelcome? I accept you and your friend, but don't bring her to Thanksgiving. Don't bring her to Christmas. Don't bring her to the birthday party. Don't bring her to the baby shower...\n\nThat isn't acceptance or inclusion, and it doesn't feel like being part of the family. Would you accept it if your husband were being treated this way? If they elect to have children, what message does it send to them if one of their parents is rejected by the family and the other still chooses to participate? If their relationship is going to work, at some point, she is going to have to put her family first in the same way that you and your husband will.", "This is excessively hateful.", "Also - I grew up Mormon in Utah and was able to do that easily.", "Aw, thank you!", "Stop digging.", "i\u2019m glad you disagree with the historic racism of the lds church. but them being homophobic is fine?", "If I had a penny for every time I've heard a religious person say \"I don't agree with x part of my religion\" I'd be rich.", "You think racism is hateful but you don\u2019t think being homophobic is hateful?", "Has the church come out in opposition to the proposed bill in Tennessee which will allow county clerks to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex, interracial, or interfaith couples if it goes against their \u201creligious beliefs\u201d? Have they scrapped their plans for a new temple in the state?\n\nNo, they haven\u2019t. That should tell you the true attitude of your church towards same-sex, interracial, and interfaith couples. That\u2019s the church that you\u2019re \u201chonoring\u201d by discriminating against your sister and her fianc\u00e9.", "Is there any way you can not agree with the homophobic teaching too? Or is that too much to ask?", "Surely you mean your \"friend.\"", "As an ex mormon, the main church is still incredibly racist and bigoted.", "And by supporting the church you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not a deal breaker for you!

So whether or not you \"support\" those doctrines in your head, you're supporting them in action by attending and in cold hard cash.\n\nThe problem with your sister and her fianc\u00e9e coming to your wedding would not be that they would make a scene, it would be all the family with bigoted beliefs who would make a scene. At least be honest with yourself about where the blame lies.", "Your church is stupid. You can\u2019t claim you support LGBT+ and then claim you\u2019re LDS. It\u2019s one or the other, right now you\u2019re just a homophobic AH.", "and you say you are a follower of the church, so what's your point? aside from being homophobic ofc", "If you truly didn\u2019t believe that you wouldn\u2019t be calling your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 her \u201cfriend.\u201d You\u2019d be acknowledging their relationship.", "Why are you choosing to have your wedding ceremony in a church whose beliefs you don't share?", "And homophobia isn't?\n\nYTA.", "As a gay women in this society, people like you are the reason I have to look at the people around me to see if I am able to hold my FIANC\u00c9S hand.
