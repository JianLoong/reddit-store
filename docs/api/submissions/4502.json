You are not obliged to stay in touch, but you might change your mind one day.", "NAH. She's not an AH and neither are you. At 18 she did what she had to do. Pragmatically, contacting you but not your parents (the actual AHs in this story) would likely not have been simple. I doubt she forgot about you.", "NAH except your parents. You can go no contact with your sister if you want, but life is long & this is probably a bad decision.  Someday you will understand that 18 is very young & she just didn\u2019t know any other way to get away so she ran.", "Nah except your parents. She wasn18. A teenager herself. She survived the only way she knew how. \n\nFor all she knew if she tried to keep a relationship with you guys your parents would have been upset. \n\nBut yeah you're not obligated but she did her best as a teen herself.", "NAH - Except of course your parents. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have a relationship with her and your feelings if abandonment are valid as is your sister getting herself out of that situation as soon as she could.", "NAH\n\nYou have no obligation to let anyone in your life.\n\nIt might be worth at least hearing her out.

The only AH's here are your parents.", "INFO what exactly did you expect her to do as a teenager fleeing an abusive home?", "NAH. At 18, she did what she needed to for her own health and well-being and, as you said, you don't blame her for that, as for no communication in that time, she may have felt like she couldn't... like contacting you would bring her back into your parents' orbit and thus risk becoming a victim to them again. That said, you're right that it's simply too little, too late for a sisterly relationship. Would you be open to maybe building a different type of relationship with her (friends, light-friends, something that maintains contact but isn't sisterly and doesn't bring up the past anymore)? If so, offer that as compromise. If not, you've met and gotten some measure of closure and can just move forward separately while wishing each other well.", "INFO: How did she react upon hearing that?\n\nThat for me determines whether she's an AH or not (you're not TA regardless)", "NAH\nI understand that you're hurt, but I also understand that she had to leave and go NC.

You can understand why she left and didn\u2019t want to risk getting pulled back in and still be resentful that she left you and your younger sibling behind in that atmosphere, that\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to feel and you should probably stop denying it for your own health. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive her and reconnect, but it\u2019s not healthy to deny your own feelings when that\u2019s clearly what you\u2019re expressing.", "NTA you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want.

She was not obligated to support her younger sisters when she left, but neither are you obligated to restore your familial relationship with her at her request. \n\nMaybe give her an opening to begin to repair the relationship slowly, if you want, but you have no moral obligation to her whatsoever.", "I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh on your sister. Maybe her leaving and the lack of contact was what she had to do to get strong again. I think NAH though as you\u2019ve both clearly been through a lot and are just trying to deal with it all.", "NTA. It's your decision if you want to have a relationship with your older sister or not. But, your older sister is NTA as well. I can understand both of you your positions. You had to grow up without an older sister that didn't contact you in 10 years, and she had to leave the house and (of course I don't know why) not contact you.

However, please keep in mind that it would have been difficult for your sister to have a relationship with you when you were underage without having to interact with your abusive parents.

My wife's eldest sister abandoned the child to the abusive father when she was 18 or 19.\n\nMy wife tried to get the estranged son in contact with her eldest sister, the abandoned boy's mother, when the boy became an adult and reached out to my wife, when my wife was in her early 20's, and my wife's eldest sister wouldn't, or couldn't, handle that.\n\nMy wife held a lot of anger towards her eldest sister for a lot of years, for being abandoned in the horror she had to continue to live with, and later over the abandonment of a child, but they occasionally have long talks on the phone now, more than 4 decades later.\n\nMy wife is one of four sisters, and my wife has been through a lot of psychotherapy. My wife thinks her eldest sister is still in a bad place, but my wife is feeling much better, so my wife can be forgiving of the other victims of what they went through.

That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.", "I am still living with my parents until she is 18 and we can then get out from there together.", "You didn't abandon her because of your own feelings about your older sister. She didn't exactly have an example or idea of what to do like you do, and your age difference with your older sister is drastic compared to your younger. Letting in your sister is definitely your own personal decision and you're not an asshole for having any of these feelings. I do strongly recommend trying though, seeing if the relationship you can build with her (which would obviously be rocky) would be worth it. You can always change your mind if you say yes now, but you may not get the opportunity to if you say no, y'know? \n\nPlus, I don't know if you would've wanted her to contact you frequently all through that time. The period after escaping an abusive situation is an emotional toss up. Things either went right up or they went right down and I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for a 12 and 7 year old.", "But you weren\u2019t in the same situation.\n\nShe was alone with them for 6 years. She was the oldest child with younger siblings with abusive parents for 12 years. \n\nShe is her own person, with her own personality and he own experiences and her own brain. Her needs are not your needs. And while you feel you have the strength to be their for your younger sib, she may have not. \n\nYour parents stole an incredible amount of stuff from you. They stole all of your childhoods, your right to be safe and loved. They stole your relationship with your older sister. \n\nShe did nothing wrong. You can feel sad and upset about her choices, but she had to do what she could to survive. \n\nSo your sister choose to not sacrifice all of her 20\u2019s just to put herself at risk of your parents abuse just to say \u201chi\u201d to you at lunch. That is ALLOWED. In fact, many therapists would suggest your sister do exactly that for her own mental health. \n\nPlease be mad all you want. But your sister did not abuse you. She reacted to that abuse the best way she could, just as you are doing. And you both reacted differently. But the person to blame here, is your parents. Who chose to put this burden on all of you as children.", "Have your parents asked if you have spoken with her?", "I never said she abused me. As you said she is her own person who reacted in her own way and I am my own person who reacted in another way. Unfortunately, our reactions to this situation is so different that I do not see a way to meet again.", "I wish you luck, And please talk to a therapist before you let your parents steal even more of your life from you.", "NAH, from experience I can tell you, I am in the same position as your sister, I had to leave my dad and stepmothers house due to physical and financial abuse at 21 ( I am now 27).\n I left behind 4 brothers and a sister. My sister and one of my brothers (both now in their 20s) can understand why we did not have contact for those years. As much as it breaks my heart that I live near talk to the younger 3 boys (one is 14, the other 2 are 8 or 9 now), I drive past their school everyday before and after work but I cannot just go see them before they got on a bus. It would put them in a horrible position of lying to their parents, possibly getting found out and hurt or my dad could be there and hurt me himself. I have to hope that when they are older they will understand or even let me explain and apologise to them for how things happened. It us not that I don't want to help them, I just can't without putting them, or myself in danger. \nPlease speak to a professional about your feelings, if you don't, you'll do more damage to yourself than your sister or parents ever could.", "NAH. She did what she needed to do to get out. Now you're doing what you need to do to protect yourself from pain. You are both victims of the household you grew up in, and I'm sorry it is continuing to cause you pain.", "NTA, for all the people defending the big sister, that's totally valid but think about what it was like for Op.\n\nYou think OP had things easier once she left? Or do you think all the abuse thrown at 3 kids was suddenly passed on to the two left? \n\nYou think the middle kid partially shielded by the fact of not being the eldest, didn't feel anything when the only person they could count on suddenly left? And didn't even send a note?\n\nI get that sister really didn't do nothing wrong, bit put yourself in OPs shows and think if that's a person you'd ever entertain in public, let alone forgive and build and familial relationship? \n\nOP whatever your decision is moving forward I honestly can't blame you, cause I know I definitely wouldn't have handled it as maturely as you did.", "Damn. I feel for you and both your siblings. \n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I understand your feelings of abandonment. \n\nI hope you get some therapy. Your parents are the only ones at fault here. \n\nNAH", "NAH. When you leave a bad family situation you cannot maintain contact with the littles. Imagine for a moment that you have a nine year old - is an adult you have zero relationship with allowed to be friends\u2026 nope.

Now that they are young adults, they are bitter - \u201c you should have tried harder\u2026\u201d they don\u2019t maintain close relationships with their AH parents but as a young adult I was supposed to fight for time\u2026. Often the AH nut doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. Walk on and find your own peace.", "NAH, but you're being real harsh. Yeah, it's horrible, it sucks, she shouldn't have done that. But what would happen if she got in contact and your parents found out? I would do so much to have a chance to reconnect with my sister after we fell out, and now she's dead, and I regret it", "NTA-One day you\u2019ll realize that your siblings are the only people on the planet who know what you went thru. They know and understand your POV.", "NAH.  Your sister was trying to survive.  At 12, you couldn't know all that she went through.  Give her a chance.  You sound very angry, which is expected.  But you are directing your anger at another victim, not the perpetrators - your parents.", "Maybe she did not contact you because she felt shame/guilt for leaving you behind.  She could barely take care of herself, she did not want to be dragged back to that situation.", "No one can fault her for leaving or you for feeling abandoned. It's a very complex situation, you don't know what was going on in her head.Try talking to her about the situation and get her point of view. If you don't want to, just go no contact and move on.", "NTA neither is your sister, really... just maybe in denial a bit.", "NTA. It's possible that you may change your mind in the future, but I'd say to do as you wish until then. I don't agree with the majority here and believe she should've reached out to you earlier when it was possible for her. She severed her bond to you as a sister and likely would've ignored you forever had you not run into her out of coincidence.", "NAH.   She chose to save herself, and I don\u2019t think anyone faults her for that.   But yeah.   It feels like she could have stayed in touch - even a little - before now.     She cut ties and moved forward with her life which is apparently what she needed to do, and that\u2019s fine.    But sadly you were one of those ties.\n\nSo very sorry that your parents sucked ,  and that you also lost your older sister because of it.   I hope you and your younger sister are on a healthier path forward.", "If the parents are that abusive they could monitor that sort of communication, and block her or change OP\u2019s email to force no contact. Plus could make things worse for OP and her sister for having that communication.\n\nIf the sister continued after that, the parents could legally go after her for harassment or stalking. That\u2019s also a bad situation.", ">She knew where I go to school and the road that I took each day.\n\nLegally, your parents would have been able to nail her for stalking.", "Many schools would call the police if an adult they don't know anything about just turned up at a school, and then your parents would hear about it.\n\nIt sucks, I am sorry but its inappropriate for an adult to do this.

When you're a kid, you have the family you were born into. Once you're an adult you choose the family you want in your life. If that includes the bio ones, fine. But if not, don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. You do you.", "You are not responsible for your younger sister, and she was not responsible for you.  Your parents were responsible for all of you, and they failed.", ">I turned 18 and had a younger sister and I did not abandon her. That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.\n\nAnd I understand why you feel that way, but the fact of the matter is, there is no right or wrong in how either of you chose to deal with the situation. She's not an awful person for abandoning you, and you're not an awful peraon for staying for your sister. \n\nI just want you to think about the things I'm going to say, and I hope you realize that ppl have different ways of internalizing trauma and you can't predict how they're going to react. \n\nLet's say your younger sister comes to realize the sacrifice you've been making for her (assuming she hasn't already). What would you think if she got angry at you for it, and was upset that you put yourself through that for her sake? What if she told you she wished you hadn't done that? Would you be upset? Would you feel sad?\n\nI want you to compare that to what your older sister is feeling now. She had no idea how you would think about her, whether she stayed or left. Either way, she was risking a negative reaction from you. I don't blame her for choosing the option that gave her freedom from your parent's abuse. \n\nI also want you to think about what might have happened, if your sister chose to keep in contact, had your parents found out about it. Do you think your parents would just get mad at her? Or do you think they would have lashed out at you as well? Do you think maybe your sister was trying to protect both herself *and* you by not maintaining contact?\n\nAnd this may be the hardest thing to think about, but aske yourself this: if your parents are not aware that you're staying on behalf of your younger sister but somehow find out, is there a chance their abuse toward the two of you could get worse? Are there any instances where your parents take their anger out on you on your sister instead? You say you're staying so you don't abandon your sister, but are you able to do anything for her in the midst of the abuse?\n\nI think having this mentality of \"my sister abandoned me\" is reasonable, but flawed. Your sister was extremely limited in what she was able to do for you, and frankly, you have no way of knowing if things would have been better had she stayed. You have no way of knowing if she could have protected you or been a source of mental healing for you. You have no idea if she would have crumbled under your parent's abuse and done somethingn awful to herself. \n\nIt kind of sounds like you were expecting her to be this lighthouse in the storm for you, someone to place all your hopes on, but another person just cannot fill that kind of role for you. Your sister simply cannot be your emotional stability or savior.", "Previous poster didn't downplay it.  They rightfully observed it's misdirected.     \n\n\nShe was 18.    OP, you're 21 now.    Believe it or not, ten years from now you're going to look back on this and realize that you're a very young person, and an 18 year old is practically a child.

My point still stands.", "NAH - but OP your anger is misdirected here.   Be angry at your parents.\n\nShe had no power to see you if your parents didn\u2019t want her to see you.

Suddenly, a huge burden was placed on you and your younger sister that the 3 of you used to share. Things were probably especially hard after she left as your parents had newly intensified feelings of anger, regret, and injustice that they already sucked at dealing with. You had to step up and be the big sis and take on her role as well as your own which I'm sure was incredibly painful. As an adult, your sister could have begun to fight for custody of you and your other sister, or worked with authorities to ensure you were safe. She could have texted, emailed, or called. \n\nShe might have been afraid of the repercussions you would face if your parents found out, though. My mom smashed my phone when she found out I was texting my dad and locked me in the bathroom for hours. She might have envisioned something like that happening to you and decided it was selfish to reach out to you. So she went it alone. Your sister ran from a bad situation. It might have taken her quite a while to get her life in order after that and she might have been scared to reach out to you or embarrassed about what her life looked like during that time. I know some people in similar situations who turned to bad crowds for a while when they were trying to figure themselves out and how to navigate life at a young age. She should have reached out to you, but who knows? She might have fallen into a drug/alcohol problem, or repeated the cycle of abuse by having an abusive/manipulative/controlling partner for a while. She also experienced trauma from your parents and may have had a serious trauma response such as forgetting a lot of her childhood and not feeling emotional attachments properly for a while. Things might have gotten out of hand in her life. \n\nI understand needing time, but I think you're misplacing your anger some by cutting her off. She had to survive and did what she felt she had to do. Your relationship will never be the same, but you could end up forging a completely unique relationship as fellow survivors of your childhoods. As long as she never harmed you or abused you, I think there's hope that one day you'll at least be able to smile at one another and feel some kind of friendship and comfort.", "Edit: NAH \n\nAs an older sister who left when I was 16 to escape an abusive household, leaving behind my younger brother who was 15 at the time, I can promise you she feels shitty about it but did what she had to do to get through what was I'm sure an actual hell on earth. \n\nI didn't have contact with my brother for years. He didn't have a phone and I wasn't going to risk going back to the house or anywhere near where my father could be. Do I feel bad? Yes, I feel awful, but I did what had to be done to protect myself because I was no good to anyone if I wound up killing myself, which was the only other outcome if I didn't leave.

You have every right to not want a relationship but she had no way of *truly* knowing how your parents would be. Sure she had some information from her uncle, but she knew her uncle's perspective isn't gonna be the same as yours. It's possible, when children leave abusive households, that the parents are going to be angrier and even more abusive towards the remaining children. Its possible that one day within those ten years, you leave your phone out or you get caught seeing her and it's game over for you", "Sis #2 is 21, but sis #3 is 17. Sis #1 may not be completely out of the clear until all the siblings are away from the household. If #2 is still involved with the parents elder sis is right to keep her distance! Especially because #2is angry with her and might use the parents or the younger sis to cause her more pain.", "She was right to avoid risking your safety for a chat. You may have been willing to risk it at the time, but then your aita might read, \u201caita for being angry at my sis for the beatings I incurred when she ran away and went behind my parents back to contact me?\u201d", "She chose to get herself out of danger ASAP, did you expect her to stay until all three of you were old enough to leave together? \nWhile I\u2019m gonna vote NAH for the overall situation, I\u2019d highly recommend looking into therapy for just your trauma, your need to set aside your own safety, and your anger towards your older sister. \nEscaping from an abusive household means avoiding everyone in the house. You or your sister could\u2019ve accidentally let slip that you were meeting with your sister and that could\u2019ve caused tons of trouble for all three of you. \nI promise your sister was feeling guilt and hurt every day knowing you were trapped there, but you can ask anyone with chronic pain, over time the pain just becomes part of your life and you lose focus on it. \n\nI\u2019m not saying immediately forgive your sister, but don\u2019t completely discard the notion of a future relationship once all three of you are safe", "Agree", "It's not really that drastic: older sis is 6 years older and younger sis is 5 years younger. That age difference is actually pretty similar.", "It's okay if you feel that way now. 21 is not that old though. Leave some space in your heart to reconnect, because your feelings may and probably will change. Her life is probably just starting to get stable-ish now. I would encourage you to seek therapy (if you are in school most colleges offer this for free or part of the student health plan) and get some professional insight. Good luck. <3", "Have you given any thought to the fact that your sister may have suffered more abuse or been unable to live thru the abuse as you did. How you reacted to what was done may be completely different from how your sister handled things.", "I realized after the 50 upvotes and was very too lazy to edit, thank you lolol, someone needed to call me out, I think I can sleep now"]}
