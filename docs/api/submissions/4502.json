Your sister had to make this choice for her own well being, but ofcourse it hurts she went nc. You probably feel she abandoned you while you needed her. I think you should give it some time, maybe hear her out and then decide whether you want to have contact at the moment. You are not obliged to stay in touch, but you might change your mind one day.", "NAH. She's not an AH and neither are you. At 18 she did what she had to do. Pragmatically, contacting you but not your parents (the actual AHs in this story) would likely not have been simple. I doubt she forgot about you.", "NAH except your parents. You can go no contact with your sister if you want, but life is long & this is probably a bad decision.  Someday you will understand that 18 is very young & she just didn\u2019t know any other way to get away so she ran.", "Nah except your parents. She wasn18. A teenager herself. She survived the only way she knew how. \n\nFor all she knew if she tried to keep a relationship with you guys your parents would have been upset. \n\nBut yeah you're not obligated but she did her best as a teen herself.", "NAH - Except of course your parents. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have a relationship with her and your feelings if abandonment are valid as is your sister getting herself out of that situation as soon as she could.", "NAH\n\nYou have no obligation to let anyone in your life.\n\nIt might be worth at least hearing her out. She probably felt horrible leaving you behind, but she was 18yo. She could have been waiting until she was fully prepared to reach out.", "NAH. The only AH's here are your parents.", "INFO what exactly did you expect her to do as a teenager fleeing an abusive home?", "NAH. At 18, she did what she needed to for her own health and well-being and, as you said, you don't blame her for that, as for no communication in that time, she may have felt like she couldn't... like contacting you would bring her back into your parents' orbit and thus risk becoming a victim to them again. That said, you're right that it's simply too little, too late for a sisterly relationship. Would you be open to maybe building a different type of relationship with her (friends, light-friends, something that maintains contact but isn't sisterly and doesn't bring up the past anymore)? If so, offer that as compromise. If not, you've met and gotten some measure of closure and can just move forward separately while wishing each other well.", "INFO: How did she react upon hearing that?\n\nThat for me determines whether she's an AH or not (you're not TA regardless)", "NAH\nI understand that you're hurt, but I also understand that she had to leave and go NC. You can make your decision either way, but ask yourself if you are willing to lose her again.", "NTA. But you are being dishonest with yourself in saying you don\u2019t blame her for getting out. You can understand why she left and didn\u2019t want to risk getting pulled back in and still be resentful that she left you and your younger sibling behind in that atmosphere, that\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to feel and you should probably stop denying it for your own health. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive her and reconnect, but it\u2019s not healthy to deny your own feelings when that\u2019s clearly what you\u2019re expressing.", "NTA you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want. She could have emailed or anything to touch base evey now and then.", "NAH. Maybe your sister was traumatised and had to get out that house  the moment she could. Everything in and around that house must have been upsetting to her for a long, long time. It wasn't created by you, but your parents of course. \n\nTake baby steps repairing the relationship, but only if you want to.", "NTA. You are completely justified. She was not obligated to support her younger sisters when she left, but neither are you obligated to restore your familial relationship with her at her request. \n\nMaybe give her an opening to begin to repair the relationship slowly, if you want, but you have no moral obligation to her whatsoever.", "I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh on your sister. Maybe her leaving and the lack of contact was what she had to do to get strong again. I think NAH though as you\u2019ve both clearly been through a lot and are just trying to deal with it all.", "NTA. It's your decision if you want to have a relationship with your older sister or not. But, your older sister is NTA as well. I can understand both of you your positions. You had to grow up without an older sister that didn't contact you in 10 years, and she had to leave the house and (of course I don't know why) not contact you. If you feel really bad about your sister or your gut says to establish a relationship with her, then you can give her an opportunity, but remember.

I hope she will keep trying (with your younger sister too), but do it by really showing you that she's sorry and really demonstrating that she can be a sister again.", "NAH - Your feelings are totally valid and you would not be an AH to decide that it isn\u2019t worth it to you to rebuild a relationship. However, please keep in mind that it would have been difficult for your sister to have a relationship with you when you were underage without having to interact with your abusive parents. It would have taken her awhile to deal with the abuse she suffered from as a child and she wouldn\u2019t have known how to navigate this issue at 18. You might want to consider giving her some grace here.", "NAH She did what she needed to do to get away. College was my way out at 18, but my mother sabotaged my college applications, so I had to reapply the following year and do everything in complete secret to protect myself. Running is pretty much all you can do at that age. If I had a younger sibling I have no idea how I could of possibly kept in touch with them whilst escaping my narcissistic and violent mother. I have no idea how your sister could both possibly escape and keep in contact with a minor still in the household of her NC parents. It is likely they would of forbidden contact. You are asking for something that was probably pretty impossible.", "Like people are saying\n\nNAH\n\nMy wife's eldest sister got pregnant at 17, or maybe 16, and got thrown out. The father of that baby married my wife's eldest sister, and abused her, and tossed her aside. My wife's eldest sister abandoned the child to the abusive father when she was 18 or 19.\n\nMy wife tried to get the estranged son in contact with her eldest sister, the abandoned boy's mother, when the boy became an adult and reached out to my wife, when my wife was in her early 20's, and my wife's eldest sister wouldn't, or couldn't, handle that.\n\nMy wife held a lot of anger towards her eldest sister for a lot of years, for being abandoned in the horror she had to continue to live with, and later over the abandonment of a child, but they occasionally have long talks on the phone now, more than 4 decades later.\n\nMy wife is one of four sisters, and my wife has been through a lot of psychotherapy. My wife thinks her eldest sister is still in a bad place, but my wife is feeling much better, so my wife can be forgiving of the other victims of what they went through. That forgiveness is limited, and we don't go and visit my wife's sisters in person, but my wife accepts the fact they all had their own rocky roads to travel, and they all made some pretty bad choices along the way. There were no good choices available.\n\nGood luck.", "Nothing. But lets say when she was 21 or 22. She knew where I go to school and the road that I took each day. She could not have once come and see me? It is not like my parents have guards following me. My uncle , the one who helped her after she left, was also willing to help us have some kind of contact without my parents knowing  but She did not want to take any risks.", "she was kind of stunned. apologized again and left.", "Lose her again? She never got her back.", "I am not denying my feelings .  I do not blame her for leaving but I have resentment for the complete no contact. She kept contact with our uncle as he was the one who helped her after she left. He was willing to help us keep some kind of contact behind my parents back but she did not want to take any risks that could potentially have her cross path with my parents again.", "She shouldn't keep trying with OP. She should respect her boundaries and hope she reaches out when she's ready.", "I'm not going to call you the AH here but you're angry at the wrong person.", "\u201cShe did not want to take any risks\u201d \n\nShe was trying to keep herself safe and healthy. That\u2019s a priority over your wants. \n\nAnd schools don\u2019t like random adults popping in, they\u2019d have alerted your parents. \n\nI mean this with compassion, but you need to see a therapist. You are upset your sister for trying to save her own life and not risking that to see you at lunch. \nLearn to direct you anger at your parents instead of another of their victims.", "Then NAH. I do think she should've tried to keep contact with you, not take you in but just keep contact. But I don't think she's an AH for failing to do that considering the circumstances. But she's got no right to then be upset that the ship has sailed, and it sounds like she took it fairly well. People can leave whenever they want but they can't come back as they please.\n\nDo either of you keep in contact with your younger sister? It sounds like she's 16 and so I'm guessing she's still with your parents", "NAH. She saw risk in contacting you - maybe for herself, or maybe for you. What would have happened to you if your parents found out you had contact with her? It\u2019s a sad, terrible situation your parents put you in. Hindsight is 20/20. Give it a chance.", "I get you are upset. But she did the best she could and undoubtedly it was also done for you since it had to be done behind your parents back. You could always answer honestly \u201cI do not have contact with her\u201d and she didn\u2019t have to keep looking over her shoulder. Did your parents ask you \u201cwhere is your sister? Have you spoken with her?\u201d If they did, then yes she kept you both safe. You could deny and not risk divulging. She did you a solid one! It\u2019s hard to see. You must feel abandoned.", "Here's a question. Will you hold on to this a resentment forever? Or will talking to her about it and working through it help your mental state?\n\nI have a lot of issues with my siblings but having the chance to talk about them is helping me move on more than helping me build my relationship with them. If you can benefit from talking to her and it would help you then you should do it.", "OP has the right to feel what she feels. Don\u2019t downplay her own trauma.", "well yeah that's her choice. To be fair, it is really hard for me to have a lot of understanding for her. I was in the same situation as her. I turned 18 and had a younger sister and I did not abandon her. That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.", "I am still living with my parents until she is 18 and we can then get out from there together.", "You didn't abandon her because of your own feelings about your older sister. She didn't exactly have an example or idea of what to do like you do, and your age difference with your older sister is drastic compared to your younger. Letting in your sister is definitely your own personal decision and you're not an asshole for having any of these feelings. I do strongly recommend trying though, seeing if the relationship you can build with her (which would obviously be rocky) would be worth it. You can always change your mind if you say yes now, but you may not get the opportunity to if you say no, y'know? \n\nPlus, I don't know if you would've wanted her to contact you frequently all through that time. The period after escaping an abusive situation is an emotional toss up. Things either went right up or they went right down and I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for a 12 and 7 year old.", "But you weren\u2019t in the same situation.\n\nShe was alone with them for 6 years. She was the oldest child with younger siblings with abusive parents for 12 years. \n\nShe is her own person, with her own personality and he own experiences and her own brain. Her needs are not your needs. And while you feel you have the strength to be their for your younger sib, she may have not. \n\nYour parents stole an incredible amount of stuff from you. They stole all of your childhoods, your right to be safe and loved. They stole your relationship with your older sister. \n\nShe did nothing wrong. You can feel sad and upset about her choices, but she had to do what she could to survive. \n\nSo your sister choose to not sacrifice all of her 20\u2019s just to put herself at risk of your parents abuse just to say \u201chi\u201d to you at lunch. That is ALLOWED. In fact, many therapists would suggest your sister do exactly that for her own mental health. \n\nPlease be mad all you want. But your sister did not abuse you. She reacted to that abuse the best way she could, just as you are doing. And you both reacted differently. But the person to blame here, is your parents. Who chose to put this burden on all of you as children.", "Have your parents asked if you have spoken with her?", "I never said she abused me. As you said she is her own person who reacted in her own way and I am my own person who reacted in another way. Unfortunately, our reactions to this situation is so different that I do not see a way to meet again.", "I wish you luck, And please talk to a therapist before you let your parents steal even more of your life from you."]}
