You are not obliged to stay in touch, but you might change your mind one day.", "NAH. She's not an AH and neither are you. At 18 she did what she had to do. Pragmatically, contacting you but not your parents (the actual AHs in this story) would likely not have been simple. I doubt she forgot about you.", "NAH except your parents. You can go no contact with your sister if you want, but life is long & this is probably a bad decision.  Someday you will understand that 18 is very young & she just didn\u2019t know any other way to get away so she ran.", "Nah except your parents. She wasn18. A teenager herself. She survived the only way she knew how. \n\nFor all she knew if she tried to keep a relationship with you guys your parents would have been upset. \n\nBut yeah you're not obligated but she did her best as a teen herself.", "NAH - Except of course your parents. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have a relationship with her and your feelings if abandonment are valid as is your sister getting herself out of that situation as soon as she could.", "NAH\n\nYou have no obligation to let anyone in your life.\n\nIt might be worth at least hearing her out. She probably felt horrible leaving you behind, but she was 18yo. She could have been waiting until she was fully prepared to reach out.", "NAH. The only AH's here are your parents.", "INFO what exactly did you expect her to do as a teenager fleeing an abusive home?", "NAH. At 18, she did what she needed to for her own health and well-being and, as you said, you don't blame her for that, as for no communication in that time, she may have felt like she couldn't... like contacting you would bring her back into your parents' orbit and thus risk becoming a victim to them again. That said, you're right that it's simply too little, too late for a sisterly relationship. Would you be open to maybe building a different type of relationship with her (friends, light-friends, something that maintains contact but isn't sisterly and doesn't bring up the past anymore)? If so, offer that as compromise. If not, you've met and gotten some measure of closure and can just move forward separately while wishing each other well.", "INFO: How did she react upon hearing that?\n\nThat for me determines whether she's an AH or not (you're not TA regardless)", "NAH\nI understand that you're hurt, but I also understand that she had to leave and go NC.

You can understand why she left and didn\u2019t want to risk getting pulled back in and still be resentful that she left you and your younger sibling behind in that atmosphere, that\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to feel and you should probably stop denying it for your own health. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive her and reconnect, but it\u2019s not healthy to deny your own feelings when that\u2019s clearly what you\u2019re expressing.", "NTA you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want.

She was not obligated to support her younger sisters when she left, but neither are you obligated to restore your familial relationship with her at her request. \n\nMaybe give her an opening to begin to repair the relationship slowly, if you want, but you have no moral obligation to her whatsoever.", "I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh on your sister. Maybe her leaving and the lack of contact was what she had to do to get strong again. I think NAH though as you\u2019ve both clearly been through a lot and are just trying to deal with it all.", "NTA. It's your decision if you want to have a relationship with your older sister or not. But, your older sister is NTA as well. I can understand both of you your positions. You had to grow up without an older sister that didn't contact you in 10 years, and she had to leave the house and (of course I don't know why) not contact you.

However, please keep in mind that it would have been difficult for your sister to have a relationship with you when you were underage without having to interact with your abusive parents.

My wife's eldest sister abandoned the child to the abusive father when she was 18 or 19.\n\nMy wife tried to get the estranged son in contact with her eldest sister, the abandoned boy's mother, when the boy became an adult and reached out to my wife, when my wife was in her early 20's, and my wife's eldest sister wouldn't, or couldn't, handle that.\n\nMy wife held a lot of anger towards her eldest sister for a lot of years, for being abandoned in the horror she had to continue to live with, and later over the abandonment of a child, but they occasionally have long talks on the phone now, more than 4 decades later.\n\nMy wife is one of four sisters, and my wife has been through a lot of psychotherapy. My wife thinks her eldest sister is still in a bad place, but my wife is feeling much better, so my wife can be forgiving of the other victims of what they went through.

That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.", "I am still living with my parents until she is 18 and we can then get out from there together.", "You didn't abandon her because of your own feelings about your older sister. She didn't exactly have an example or idea of what to do like you do, and your age difference with your older sister is drastic compared to your younger. Letting in your sister is definitely your own personal decision and you're not an asshole for having any of these feelings. I do strongly recommend trying though, seeing if the relationship you can build with her (which would obviously be rocky) would be worth it. You can always change your mind if you say yes now, but you may not get the opportunity to if you say no, y'know? \n\nPlus, I don't know if you would've wanted her to contact you frequently all through that time. The period after escaping an abusive situation is an emotional toss up. Things either went right up or they went right down and I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for a 12 and 7 year old.", "But you weren\u2019t in the same situation.\n\nShe was alone with them for 6 years. She was the oldest child with younger siblings with abusive parents for 12 years. \n\nShe is her own person, with her own personality and he own experiences and her own brain. Her needs are not your needs. And while you feel you have the strength to be their for your younger sib, she may have not. \n\nYour parents stole an incredible amount of stuff from you. They stole all of your childhoods, your right to be safe and loved. They stole your relationship with your older sister. \n\nShe did nothing wrong. You can feel sad and upset about her choices, but she had to do what she could to survive. \n\nSo your sister choose to not sacrifice all of her 20\u2019s just to put herself at risk of your parents abuse just to say \u201chi\u201d to you at lunch. That is ALLOWED. In fact, many therapists would suggest your sister do exactly that for her own mental health. \n\nPlease be mad all you want. But your sister did not abuse you. She reacted to that abuse the best way she could, just as you are doing. And you both reacted differently. But the person to blame here, is your parents. Who chose to put this burden on all of you as children.", "Have your parents asked if you have spoken with her?", "I never said she abused me. As you said she is her own person who reacted in her own way and I am my own person who reacted in another way. Unfortunately, our reactions to this situation is so different that I do not see a way to meet again.", "I wish you luck, And please talk to a therapist before you let your parents steal even more of your life from you.", "NAH, from experience I can tell you, I am in the same position as your sister, I had to leave my dad and stepmothers house due to physical and financial abuse at 21 ( I am now 27).\n I left behind 4 brothers and a sister. My sister and one of my brothers (both now in their 20s) can understand why we did not have contact for those years. As much as it breaks my heart that I live near talk to the younger 3 boys (one is 14, the other 2 are 8 or 9 now), I drive past their school everyday before and after work but I cannot just go see them before they got on a bus. It would put them in a horrible position of lying to their parents, possibly getting found out and hurt or my dad could be there and hurt me himself. I have to hope that when they are older they will understand or even let me explain and apologise to them for how things happened. It us not that I don't want to help them, I just can't without putting them, or myself in danger. \nPlease speak to a professional about your feelings, if you don't, you'll do more damage to yourself than your sister or parents ever could.", "NAH. She did what she needed to do to get out. Now you're doing what you need to do to protect yourself from pain. You are both victims of the household you grew up in, and I'm sorry it is continuing to cause you pain.", "NTA, for all the people defending the big sister, that's totally valid but think about what it was like for Op.\n\nYou think OP had things easier once she left? Or do you think all the abuse thrown at 3 kids was suddenly passed on to the two left? \n\nYou think the middle kid partially shielded by the fact of not being the eldest, didn't feel anything when the only person they could count on suddenly left? And didn't even send a note?\n\nI get that sister really didn't do nothing wrong, bit put yourself in OPs shows and think if that's a person you'd ever entertain in public, let alone forgive and build and familial relationship? \n\nOP whatever your decision is moving forward I honestly can't blame you, cause I know I definitely wouldn't have handled it as maturely as you did.", "Damn. I feel for you and both your siblings. \n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I understand your feelings of abandonment. \n\nI hope you get some therapy. Your parents are the only ones at fault here. \n\nNAH", "NAH. When you leave a bad family situation you cannot maintain contact with the littles. Imagine for a moment that you have a nine year old - is an adult you have zero relationship with allowed to be friends\u2026 nope.

Now that they are young adults, they are bitter - \u201c you should have tried harder\u2026\u201d they don\u2019t maintain close relationships with their AH parents but as a young adult I was supposed to fight for time\u2026. Often the AH nut doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. Walk on and find your own peace.", "NAH, but you're being real harsh. Yeah, it's horrible, it sucks, she shouldn't have done that. But what would happen if she got in contact and your parents found out? I would do so much to have a chance to reconnect with my sister after we fell out, and now she's dead, and I regret it", "NTA-One day you\u2019ll realize that your siblings are the only people on the planet who know what you went thru. They know and understand your POV.", "NAH.  Your sister was trying to survive.  At 12, you couldn't know all that she went through.  Give her a chance.  You sound very angry, which is expected.  But you are directing your anger at another victim, not the perpetrators - your parents.", "Maybe she did not contact you because she felt shame/guilt for leaving you behind.  She could barely take care of herself, she did not want to be dragged back to that situation.", "No one can fault her for leaving or you for feeling abandoned. It's a very complex situation, you don't know what was going on in her head.Try talking to her about the situation and get her point of view. If you don't want to, just go no contact and move on.", "NTA neither is your sister, really... just maybe in denial a bit.", "NTA. It's possible that you may change your mind in the future, but I'd say to do as you wish until then. I don't agree with the majority here and believe she should've reached out to you earlier when it was possible for her. She severed her bond to you as a sister and likely would've ignored you forever had you not run into her out of coincidence.", "NAH.   She chose to save herself, and I don\u2019t think anyone faults her for that.   But yeah.   It feels like she could have stayed in touch - even a little - before now.     She cut ties and moved forward with her life which is apparently what she needed to do, and that\u2019s fine.    But sadly you were one of those ties.\n\nSo very sorry that your parents sucked ,  and that you also lost your older sister because of it.   I hope you and your younger sister are on a healthier path forward.", "If the parents are that abusive they could monitor that sort of communication, and block her or change OP\u2019s email to force no contact. Plus could make things worse for OP and her sister for having that communication.\n\nIf the sister continued after that, the parents could legally go after her for harassment or stalking. That\u2019s also a bad situation.", ">She knew where I go to school and the road that I took each day.\n\nLegally, your parents would have been able to nail her for stalking.", "Many schools would call the police if an adult they don't know anything about just turned up at a school, and then your parents would hear about it.\n\nIt sucks, I am sorry but its inappropriate for an adult to do this.

When you're a kid, you have the family you were born into. Once you're an adult you choose the family you want in your life. If that includes the bio ones, fine. But if not, don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. You do you.", "You are not responsible for your younger sister, and she was not responsible for you.  Your parents were responsible for all of you, and they failed.", ">I turned 18 and had a younger sister and I did not abandon her. That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.\n\nAnd I understand why you feel that way, but the fact of the matter is, there is no right or wrong in how either of you chose to deal with the situation. She's not an awful person for abandoning you, and you're not an awful peraon for staying for your sister. \n\nI just want you to think about the things I'm going to say, and I hope you realize that ppl have different ways of internalizing trauma and you can't predict how they're going to react. \n\nLet's say your younger sister comes to realize the sacrifice you've been making for her (assuming she hasn't already). What would you think if she got angry at you for it, and was upset that you put yourself through that for her sake? What if she told you she wished you hadn't done that? Would you be upset? Would you feel sad?\n\nI want you to compare that to what your older sister is feeling now. She had no idea how you would think about her, whether she stayed or left. Either way, she was risking a negative reaction from you. I don't blame her for choosing the option that gave her freedom from your parent's abuse. \n\nI also want you to think about what might have happened, if your sister chose to keep in contact, had your parents found out about it. Do you think your parents would just get mad at her? Or do you think they would have lashed out at you as well? Do you think maybe your sister was trying to protect both herself *and* you by not maintaining contact?\n\nAnd this may be the hardest thing to think about, but aske yourself this: if your parents are not aware that you're staying on behalf of your younger sister but somehow find out, is there a chance their abuse toward the two of you could get worse? Are there any instances where your parents take their anger out on you on your sister instead? You say you're staying so you don't abandon your sister, but are you able to do anything for her in the midst of the abuse?\n\nI think having this mentality of \"my sister abandoned me\" is reasonable, but flawed. Your sister was extremely limited in what she was able to do for you, and frankly, you have no way of knowing if things would have been better had she stayed. You have no way of knowing if she could have protected you or been a source of mental healing for you. You have no idea if she would have crumbled under your parent's abuse and done somethingn awful to herself. \n\nIt kind of sounds like you were expecting her to be this lighthouse in the storm for you, someone to place all your hopes on, but another person just cannot fill that kind of role for you. Your sister simply cannot be your emotional stability or savior.", "Previous poster didn't downplay it.  They rightfully observed it's misdirected.     \n\n\nShe was 18.    OP, you're 21 now.    Believe it or not, ten years from now you're going to look back on this and realize that you're a very young person, and an 18 year old is practically a child.

My point still stands.", "NAH - but OP your anger is misdirected here.   Be angry at your parents.\n\nShe had no power to see you if your parents didn\u2019t want her to see you.

Suddenly, a huge burden was placed on you and your younger sister that the 3 of you used to share. Things were probably especially hard after she left as your parents had newly intensified feelings of anger, regret, and injustice that they already sucked at dealing with. You had to step up and be the big sis and take on her role as well as your own which I'm sure was incredibly painful. As an adult, your sister could have begun to fight for custody of you and your other sister, or worked with authorities to ensure you were safe. She could have texted, emailed, or called. \n\nShe might have been afraid of the repercussions you would face if your parents found out, though. My mom smashed my phone when she found out I was texting my dad and locked me in the bathroom for hours. She might have envisioned something like that happening to you and decided it was selfish to reach out to you. So she went it alone. Your sister ran from a bad situation. It might have taken her quite a while to get her life in order after that and she might have been scared to reach out to you or embarrassed about what her life looked like during that time. I know some people in similar situations who turned to bad crowds for a while when they were trying to figure themselves out and how to navigate life at a young age. She should have reached out to you, but who knows? She might have fallen into a drug/alcohol problem, or repeated the cycle of abuse by having an abusive/manipulative/controlling partner for a while. She also experienced trauma from your parents and may have had a serious trauma response such as forgetting a lot of her childhood and not feeling emotional attachments properly for a while. Things might have gotten out of hand in her life. \n\nI understand needing time, but I think you're misplacing your anger some by cutting her off. She had to survive and did what she felt she had to do. Your relationship will never be the same, but you could end up forging a completely unique relationship as fellow survivors of your childhoods. As long as she never harmed you or abused you, I think there's hope that one day you'll at least be able to smile at one another and feel some kind of friendship and comfort.", "Edit: NAH \n\nAs an older sister who left when I was 16 to escape an abusive household, leaving behind my younger brother who was 15 at the time, I can promise you she feels shitty about it but did what she had to do to get through what was I'm sure an actual hell on earth. \n\nI didn't have contact with my brother for years. He didn't have a phone and I wasn't going to risk going back to the house or anywhere near where my father could be. Do I feel bad? Yes, I feel awful, but I did what had to be done to protect myself because I was no good to anyone if I wound up killing myself, which was the only other outcome if I didn't leave. I could have gone to his school, sure, but that would be weird. It's not like I knew his schedule, his teachers, or if he would tell my father where I was.

It was normal, they are getting their life together, mending pieces without parental support or any sort of mentor figure in this world is hard.\n\nIf your sister is a good person, perhaps take the above words to heart and give her a chance to be a sibling again.

You have every right to not want a relationship but she had no way of *truly* knowing how your parents would be. Sure she had some information from her uncle, but she knew her uncle's perspective isn't gonna be the same as yours.

You or your sister could\u2019ve accidentally let slip that you were meeting with your sister and that could\u2019ve caused tons of trouble for all three of you. \nI promise your sister was feeling guilt and hurt every day knowing you were trapped there, but you can ask anyone with chronic pain, over time the pain just becomes part of your life and you lose focus on it. \n\nI\u2019m not saying immediately forgive your sister, but don\u2019t completely discard the notion of a future relationship once all three of you are safe", "Agree", "It's not really that drastic: older sis is 6 years older and younger sis is 5 years younger.

My baby sister caught me leaving, and I'll never forget her tiny voice asking me where I was going. Even now, 20 years later, it hurts so bad. I slept on a friend's floor and cried myself to sleep for weeks thinking about her, worrying about her, hoping she was ok. The guilt ate me up inside.

Stay mad if you want, but she did not ever do a thing to you. She is not your parents, she is not responsible for what your parents did, and she is not responsible for cleaning up their mess. She went no contact because she had to. You are basically punishing her for being the victim of the same abuse you experienced. There is no realistic way she could have taken you. She went out and made a life for herself, and that's what you should to, too.", "NAH I feel sorry that you are letting your anger close this door. I don't blame you as such, but you can control the future. Don't let your past control it. Once you are older you may regret that.", "NAH.\n\nI was in a situation with parallels to your sisters. My brother was only 4 years younger than me and I left (didn\u2019t return after being kicked out) at 17. \n\nKeeping contact was almost impossible.

Contacting you while you were living there probably triggered feelings of instability. Was that rational?

I can understand not wanting contact after feeling like you were abandoned.\n\n\nThat being said, I want you to think about something. If your abusive parents caught wind from someone that your sister was still talking to  you, would they not use their mistreatment to try to get information out of you? I have known people with parents who will use abuse to interrogate their children on the whereabouts of another child. Is there any possibility your abusive parents might have done the same to you or your younger sister? \n\n\n\nWhat do you think she realistically should have done? Your parents can force you to have no contact with her as long as you're still a minor. Did they tell her not to behind your back? She could get bad charges if she tried to go against that. Charges that you ***really*** don't want on your record.\n\n\n\nWhat if her mental health was at the end of the rope? Sometimes using an action as a last resort is truly a last resort. Perhaps she needed to escape to not have mental health that's at the lowest point possible, so she ***could*** reach out to you again one day. Some people have too much going on, and use drastic measures to escape the pain. Do you know for a fact that this wasn't the case? Certain \"drastic measures\" are permanent. Most people wouldn't want to risk burdening a minor with that knowledge. Doubly so if they know said minor is already going through a lot.\n\n\n\nPlease direct anger for the abuse at the abusers. It's cool if you don't want contact with your sister, but I don't think you can reasonably hold her responsible for what you and your sister went through.  You're giving your parents a W every time you blame someone else for their actions.\n\n\nI think you all need therapy, regardless of if you decide to reconnect as siblings.", "NAH you're both victims and both of your actions and thoughts are valid.

This is the digital age, she could have easily contacted you over social media and from there on plan on what to do. 10 years is way too much to just say she had to get away.

But, as many people have said, you're blaming her for making a decision that she may not have had any choice over. \n\nMy advice, don't completely close the door - there's no benefit in doing that and you never know what might happen down the road. If you shut her out, then the damage inflicted by our parents is just that little bit worse. Therapy sounds like it'd be valuable as well - if that's not financially viable at the moment, then I'm sure some charities might be able to help out or support forums could be useful as well. Good luck.", "My brother still lives in a situation like that. There's 6 years between us and as a teen I always thought I'd bring him with me but it just wasn't financially possible and I needed to leave. That was 6 years ago and now we barely speak.

He didn't have social media until recently and he doesn't even use his name.

And I'll tell you the EXACT reason I could not contact my siblings before they turned 18, and before they left the abusive situation they were in. \n\nThe first reason is that my parent wouldn't have hesitated to call the cops on me for harassing her children. The moment I left and refused to put up with the abuse, was the moment they ceased to become my siblings, who I had practically raised, and became some crazy fucking bitches children whom I had zero authority to contact. \n\nThe other reason I could not contact my siblings before they left their abusive situation (spoiler: they haven't as of now.) is purely for self preservation, I'll admit it. Having a relationship with them while they're still in the same abusive situation that I was in is dangerous for me. My parents created the triggers that had me under their thumb for almost 30 years. I am not strong enough. Say I have a relationship with my youngest sibling- how many times will he ask me to come inside for a minute, just for a minute? And soon I will see my parents and soon they'll ask for a tiny favor and they'll give me SO MUCH PRAISE for picking up a pack of cigarettes. It starts like that and it positively SUCKS you back in. \n\nYou're not wrong for your feelings. You're entitled to have them. I too wonder why many people abandoned me in my childhood to live that life when they could have helped. But it turns out, they very obviously couldn't help. \n\nBesides counseling, I recommend that if you do nothing else, make sure you become that person who doesn't turn a blind eye to abuse. Make sure you  stand up for the little people like you. And remember, deep down your sister is also one of the abused. Maybe you can't forgive her, but you should know if she's there now its 1000% because she wants to be, and despite it possibly causing her distress, she is trying to have a relationship with you.

Or by someone else? How did the meeting go? Did she stay in touch with you, or express any intent to have a relationship with you going ahead post that meeting? Did you have any kind of contact with her between when you met her at 19 and when you met her at 21?", "The first time I met her was arranged by our uncle. We both didn't know about the meeting.

If there is any forgiveness, it will likely happen in the future. Things are too fresh for the op just now.", "The true assholes are your parents. It's completely fine for you to feel the way you do. If anyone understands her trauma and the choice she had to make, it would be you. It wasn't the best choice for you but at the time it may have been the best choice for her. Your choice was made under the influence of protectiveness for your younger sister and feelings of abandoment by your older sister. Your sister made hers based on her survival instinct, and your younger sister is lucky enough not to have to make this choice at all.\n\nPlease always remember that the strength you have to overcome and endure isn't necessarily the same strength your sister has. Her choice may seem selfish to you but at the time, she deserved to be selfish. And once she was gone, she was likely apprehensive about opening the old wounds. \n\nI know there's a lot of hurt and disappointment right now but you understand the trauma. If you never had your younger sister, you would be out of there too. This life may be short or long but don't have regrets, if you can start small with your sister, I'm sure you'll be proud of who she became. \n\nI hope you will meet your sister with love and understanding in your heart and have the relationship you've always wanted. Your parent stole enough from all of you, don't let them have this too. Take the power back!", "OP, I think there is a part that you are miscalculating. If she had stayed for you that would have been another 6 years of abuse. That\u2019s asking a lot. \n\nI don\u2019t think you  are giving her any grace for the abuse she took to protect you for the years she was there. You are seeing it from your perspective which is completely fair but you don\u2019t know her circumstances when she got out. \n\nShe knew your route home from school but how would she have been able to get there? Did she have to work to survive? Did she have a job or was she living close by?  \n\nBe angry but your mind is still very much caught up\nIn the hurt you experienced and not thinking logically about the actual logistics required for her to be in your life. \n\nYou see your version of how but what if that how was impossible due to her trying to survive?", "NAH except parents. Here\u2019s something to consider, OP. Part of why you stayed is because you KNOW what it did to you to have your sister leave. Your sister didn\u2019t have that. Could she have done things differently or better? Sure. But she was a traumatized teen. She wasn\u2019t set up for success. It\u2019s your decision whether you can forgive her. And you don\u2019t have to make that decision today. But at least consider that you may want to forgive her in the future, and leave that door open. As a fellow survivor of an abusive home, you have only my sympathy and support. I wish you healing and safety.", "The Uncle who helped the sister to escape (proven ally) was willing to facilitate contact. When the sister left OP became top dog of the abuse, and then is staying until the youngest sister can get out. \n\nOp understands why her sister had to get out, but OP and young sis were still left in an abusive household and sister couldn\u2019t bother to check in through Uncle to make sure her sisters in the abusive house were surviving. Hell 2 contacts a year probably would have helped this situation a lot. \n\nThe sisters made different choices. Sister made escape plan and wasn\u2019t will to make contact until OP was an adult    \nOP is staying in the abusive household to be there for the younger sister   \n\nNeither approach is wrong, but they are diametrically opposed. Which is makes understanding the other choice hard. We also need to remember OP is still in the middle of the abuse phase, and sister is at the recovery point. I find it highly unlikely that OP is going to be able let go of her hurt until she\u2019s out of the abusive situation.  Sister has some years of freedom under her belt, that can be hard see when that freedom is still a few years off.  You can logically understand it, but the cause of the no contact was the abuse, which ties those two things together. Sister should let it drop from her end, give OP a way to contact her if she changes her mind or needs help.", "NTA, but I will tell you to get therapy for the situation. I know you're angry that your sister didn't contact you for a decade. Please just think about this because \n\nI am an older sister that got out and also didn't talk to my little sister after for years. I'll tell you though, my reasons were more than I didn't want to be reminded. I didn't want my sister telling our parent where and what I was doing. She was so brainwashed by him that I had to cut contact to keep myself safe. After she had therapy and moved out, I reached out and rekindled our relationship. It was and still is work, but we're in a better place than we were 5 years ago", "Yeah, but you're hurting yourself and you can't even see it. You're bitter, let it go.\nYou're getting a second chance, take it and make the most of it.\nYou won't regret it.", "nah except your parents. i can sympathize with your sister as i haven\u2019t seen my siblings in over 2 years due to my parents. i talk to 1 of them semi regularly but the other 2 (under 18) i can only interact with v v briefly on tiktok as anytime my mom finds out we have contact she deletes their accounts. it can be really hard to maintain a line of contact. with that, i also sympathize with you. i\u2019m sorry she couldn\u2019t be there for you and if you decide not having a relationship is what you want it\u2019s very valid. i do hope the two of you can at least try", "I\u2019m honestly in such a similar situation that reading this made me ball my eyes out. Unfortunately I\u2019m the bigger sister in this situation but I understand all sides. NAH", "NAH. But you are being hypocritical. You say you have no problem with her leaving and understand why she left and went no contact on one hand, but on the other hand, you completely cut her off at the knees when she wants to establish a new basis for a relationship with you as your sister for the same reasons. You need to be honest with yourself. You did have a problem with her going no contact. You did have a problem with her leaving. It might not be rational based on your home life, but it is explainable based on your home life. \n\nAre you sure you\u2019re not reacting out of the type of learned behavior from a very bad home life? It\u2019s very easy to disassociate when you\u2019ve experienced trauma, long-term and lose touch with your feelings. I think you need to do some serious introspection on this area of your life if you have not done so already. \n\nBecause if your home life was as bad as you were implying, it was, and you agree. She had no other choice but to leave, it should count for something that she feels safe enough to try and reach out now. I think somewhere in your mind, you are holding her leading against her, because it put you at more risk. With her gone in your bad parents, probably being very angry they probably took it out on you and your sister. This is not her fault. Just like you she had to survive. And if you have not explored these feelings with a therapist I really encourage you to do so. Because this kind of a ringing and trauma can impact all areas of your life. And you guys all deserve to not live a life full of trauma, and a lack of happiness.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s angry. I think she got angry because her sister acted all shocked, like, why are we strangers? That\u2019s enough to upset anyone. Sister isn\u2019t an AH for leaving or taking care of herself and going completely no contact. She is an AH for acting like it\u2019s weird that they\u2019re strangers.", "Idk why you all keep saying look at it from her perspective she fucking knows she doesn\u2019t blame her for leaving her she\u2019s upset she tried zero times to get into contact and the only reason they had this conversation is because they accidentally ran into each. She said in another comment her uncle helped her leave and even have the older sister a way to contact her sister without the parents knowledge she chose not to and it\u2019s OP\u2019s to feel upset about that and not want a relationship. If my sister left me and didn\u2019t text me for 10 years I definitely wouldn\u2019t be accepting of rebuilding a relationship but I also wouldn\u2019t blame her I\u2019d just be annoyed that she thinks after of ten years we could continue like nothing happened and thats OP\u2019s point.", "I read through all the responses before I replied. I went through a similar circumstance and it took me well into my 30\u2019s to consider my sister\u2019s perspective apart from my own, and it was eye-opening to get it from her firsthand. \n\nIf anything, it helped me heal, it didn\u2019t matter what direction I went after. \n\nYou also don\u2019t really know what you would do unless you actually go through something so the whole \u201cif my sister did this, I would do that\u201d stuff isn\u2019t helpful.", "How would it have been easy?", "NTA. Would she have even spoken to you if you hadn't met by chance?", "I\u2019m going with NTA. While I sympathize with your sister and her struggle, I also think you were right. She didn\u2019t have to completely cut you out and abandon you. She had options for contact that avoided your parents. She never even took the chance and left you alone. And now that you\u2019re an adult she feels okay showing up. That makes her an asshole.", "NAH - your parents are the AHs. Whereas it is completely understandable how you feel, I wonder what your older sister went through. Trauma effects people differently.  Her leaving may have been self preservation, or maybe, in her mind it was to help you both. This doesn't change that you have every right to be angry. I feel like seeing a counselor for yourself, may be helpful, regardless if reconciling is a part or comes of it.   \n\n\nI read your uncle helped set up a meeting, is it possible to take your younger sister and go there for safety?", "NTA , I had an older cousin who did this to us ( me and all my siblings) we used to have a really good relationship but one day there was a huge fight between his father and mine after that he cut contact with us COMPLETELY . They left us when we needed them the most and now for some years he has been trying to go back like the old days , my older sister is adamant we won't change anything now and i agree with her . They broke our trust , whatever happened what was the fault of little kids ?!? \n\nI can never understand people who do this and I would NEVER even want to . \nI hope you are okay and just know everything happens for some greater good . Stay strong \ud83c\udf3b", "You're acting like she was a parent with parental responsibility towards you. Your parents probably put her in that position, but that was not her job. \n\nShe had to put up with exactly what you did, except she had two younger siblings she was forced to take care of.\n\nDidn't like your homelife? Be glad for her that she escaped.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any fault with your thinking, and I applaud you for staying and making sure your younger sister can go with you. \n\nBut not all of us have your strength. And what\u2019s more, you don\u2019t know if your older sister had it worse than you. Please don\u2019t close your heart to her. The three of You have so much life ahead of you, so many opportunities. So many years. \n\nI get that maybe you\u2019re resentful right now, but that could change. Please allow your sister to keep in touch, even if you ask for space. Please allow yourself to change your mind about her, even if it takes a long time.", "NTA. But. There may come a time in life when you need someone who understands your struggles who dealt with your childhood with you. You'll need a friend. Sister's are so important. This is coming from someone who lost precious years with mine because of stupidity. I'm not saying welcome her back with open arms by any means. But maybe leave the door gapped so when you are ready and sure she isn't going to abandon you, you can try to build a relationship.", "NAH\n\nOP, I totally understand your feelings and why you may feel this way.\n\nThere is something that maybe you're not considering - maybe she had to get out because what she was dealing with was worse than you'll ever know. Typically, the eldest child has to endure the most, and she had to do what was best for her at the time.\n\nIf you want to have a relationship, start slow. If you're completely unwilling because you feel like she left you and your siblings, then that's your right, but maybe there is more than you ever realized.\n\nHappy healing to you all.", "Nta", "YTA, you basically turned into your sister.", " I would have liked to say N-A-H but I will say NTA I don't know your situation but would it have been so complicated for your sister to stay in touch with you?", "Plus given OP was under 18 at the time, contacting her during those years would require contacting the parents which clearly was an option for this sister.", "Damn, if op was in such danger then the sister is definitely a huge AH for not going to the authorities...", "I just have one question, OP, What would your parents have done if she had tried to keep in contact with you and they *found out*?", "It's not reasonable to suggest your sister stalk you in order to keep in contact. That's weird. You are kind of implying the only way she could have kept in contact was stalk you and arrange meetings through your uncle. That is a lot and it was risky. What would happen if yall got caught?   \n\n\nYou are allowed to feel hurt and abandoned because you were. BUT considering the context we can have some compassion and forgiveness towards her. You can do what ultimately feels right for you, but I hope you don't do this. I just hate the idea that your abusive parents are still able to get in between you guys. That's not fair to anyone.", "Out of all the reasons, these have to be the worst ones for temhe sister not reaching out...", "I don\u2019t know? Email? I\u2018m sure there are public options to use a computer, even if the parents would control all devices at home. School, friends, libraries\u2026\n\nA used phone costs next to nothing, leave it with a friend, use it to sometimes talk to your sister.\n\nJust meet them. OP clearly said that it would have been no problem to meet outside of their home and that the parents weren\u2019t following or surveilling/monitoring them."]}
