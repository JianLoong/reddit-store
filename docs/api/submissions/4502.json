You are not obliged to stay in touch, but you might change your mind one day.", "NAH. She's not an AH and neither are you. At 18 she did what she had to do. Pragmatically, contacting you but not your parents (the actual AHs in this story) would likely not have been simple. I doubt she forgot about you.", "NAH except your parents. You can go no contact with your sister if you want, but life is long & this is probably a bad decision.  Someday you will understand that 18 is very young & she just didn\u2019t know any other way to get away so she ran.", "Nah except your parents. She wasn18. A teenager herself. She survived the only way she knew how. \n\nFor all she knew if she tried to keep a relationship with you guys your parents would have been upset. \n\nBut yeah you're not obligated but she did her best as a teen herself.", "NAH - Except of course your parents. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have a relationship with her and your feelings if abandonment are valid as is your sister getting herself out of that situation as soon as she could.", "NAH\n\nYou have no obligation to let anyone in your life.\n\nIt might be worth at least hearing her out. She probably felt horrible leaving you behind, but she was 18yo. She could have been waiting until she was fully prepared to reach out.", "NAH. The only AH's here are your parents.", "INFO what exactly did you expect her to do as a teenager fleeing an abusive home?", "NAH. At 18, she did what she needed to for her own health and well-being and, as you said, you don't blame her for that, as for no communication in that time, she may have felt like she couldn't... like contacting you would bring her back into your parents' orbit and thus risk becoming a victim to them again. That said, you're right that it's simply too little, too late for a sisterly relationship. Would you be open to maybe building a different type of relationship with her (friends, light-friends, something that maintains contact but isn't sisterly and doesn't bring up the past anymore)? If so, offer that as compromise. If not, you've met and gotten some measure of closure and can just move forward separately while wishing each other well.", "INFO: How did she react upon hearing that?\n\nThat for me determines whether she's an AH or not (you're not TA regardless)", "NAH\nI understand that you're hurt, but I also understand that she had to leave and go NC.

You can understand why she left and didn\u2019t want to risk getting pulled back in and still be resentful that she left you and your younger sibling behind in that atmosphere, that\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to feel and you should probably stop denying it for your own health. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive her and reconnect, but it\u2019s not healthy to deny your own feelings when that\u2019s clearly what you\u2019re expressing.", "NTA you don't have to have a relationship if you don't want.

She was not obligated to support her younger sisters when she left, but neither are you obligated to restore your familial relationship with her at her request. \n\nMaybe give her an opening to begin to repair the relationship slowly, if you want, but you have no moral obligation to her whatsoever.", "I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh on your sister. Maybe her leaving and the lack of contact was what she had to do to get strong again. I think NAH though as you\u2019ve both clearly been through a lot and are just trying to deal with it all.", "NTA. It's your decision if you want to have a relationship with your older sister or not. But, your older sister is NTA as well. I can understand both of you your positions. You had to grow up without an older sister that didn't contact you in 10 years, and she had to leave the house and (of course I don't know why) not contact you.

However, please keep in mind that it would have been difficult for your sister to have a relationship with you when you were underage without having to interact with your abusive parents.

My wife's eldest sister abandoned the child to the abusive father when she was 18 or 19.\n\nMy wife tried to get the estranged son in contact with her eldest sister, the abandoned boy's mother, when the boy became an adult and reached out to my wife, when my wife was in her early 20's, and my wife's eldest sister wouldn't, or couldn't, handle that.\n\nMy wife held a lot of anger towards her eldest sister for a lot of years, for being abandoned in the horror she had to continue to live with, and later over the abandonment of a child, but they occasionally have long talks on the phone now, more than 4 decades later.\n\nMy wife is one of four sisters, and my wife has been through a lot of psychotherapy. My wife thinks her eldest sister is still in a bad place, but my wife is feeling much better, so my wife can be forgiving of the other victims of what they went through.

That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.", "I am still living with my parents until she is 18 and we can then get out from there together.", "You didn't abandon her because of your own feelings about your older sister. She didn't exactly have an example or idea of what to do like you do, and your age difference with your older sister is drastic compared to your younger. Letting in your sister is definitely your own personal decision and you're not an asshole for having any of these feelings. I do strongly recommend trying though, seeing if the relationship you can build with her (which would obviously be rocky) would be worth it. You can always change your mind if you say yes now, but you may not get the opportunity to if you say no, y'know? \n\nPlus, I don't know if you would've wanted her to contact you frequently all through that time. The period after escaping an abusive situation is an emotional toss up. Things either went right up or they went right down and I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for a 12 and 7 year old.", "But you weren\u2019t in the same situation.\n\nShe was alone with them for 6 years. She was the oldest child with younger siblings with abusive parents for 12 years. \n\nShe is her own person, with her own personality and he own experiences and her own brain. Her needs are not your needs. And while you feel you have the strength to be their for your younger sib, she may have not. \n\nYour parents stole an incredible amount of stuff from you. They stole all of your childhoods, your right to be safe and loved. They stole your relationship with your older sister. \n\nShe did nothing wrong. You can feel sad and upset about her choices, but she had to do what she could to survive. \n\nSo your sister choose to not sacrifice all of her 20\u2019s just to put herself at risk of your parents abuse just to say \u201chi\u201d to you at lunch. That is ALLOWED. In fact, many therapists would suggest your sister do exactly that for her own mental health. \n\nPlease be mad all you want. But your sister did not abuse you. She reacted to that abuse the best way she could, just as you are doing. And you both reacted differently. But the person to blame here, is your parents. Who chose to put this burden on all of you as children.", "Have your parents asked if you have spoken with her?", "I never said she abused me. As you said she is her own person who reacted in her own way and I am my own person who reacted in another way. Unfortunately, our reactions to this situation is so different that I do not see a way to meet again.", "I wish you luck, And please talk to a therapist before you let your parents steal even more of your life from you.", "NAH, from experience I can tell you, I am in the same position as your sister, I had to leave my dad and stepmothers house due to physical and financial abuse at 21 ( I am now 27).\n I left behind 4 brothers and a sister. My sister and one of my brothers (both now in their 20s) can understand why we did not have contact for those years. As much as it breaks my heart that I live near talk to the younger 3 boys (one is 14, the other 2 are 8 or 9 now), I drive past their school everyday before and after work but I cannot just go see them before they got on a bus. It would put them in a horrible position of lying to their parents, possibly getting found out and hurt or my dad could be there and hurt me himself. I have to hope that when they are older they will understand or even let me explain and apologise to them for how things happened. It us not that I don't want to help them, I just can't without putting them, or myself in danger. \nPlease speak to a professional about your feelings, if you don't, you'll do more damage to yourself than your sister or parents ever could.", "NAH. She did what she needed to do to get out. Now you're doing what you need to do to protect yourself from pain. You are both victims of the household you grew up in, and I'm sorry it is continuing to cause you pain.", "NTA, for all the people defending the big sister, that's totally valid but think about what it was like for Op.\n\nYou think OP had things easier once she left? Or do you think all the abuse thrown at 3 kids was suddenly passed on to the two left? \n\nYou think the middle kid partially shielded by the fact of not being the eldest, didn't feel anything when the only person they could count on suddenly left? And didn't even send a note?\n\nI get that sister really didn't do nothing wrong, bit put yourself in OPs shows and think if that's a person you'd ever entertain in public, let alone forgive and build and familial relationship? \n\nOP whatever your decision is moving forward I honestly can't blame you, cause I know I definitely wouldn't have handled it as maturely as you did.", "Damn. I feel for you and both your siblings. \n\nShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I understand your feelings of abandonment. \n\nI hope you get some therapy. Your parents are the only ones at fault here. \n\nNAH", "NAH. When you leave a bad family situation you cannot maintain contact with the littles. Imagine for a moment that you have a nine year old - is an adult you have zero relationship with allowed to be friends\u2026 nope.

Now that they are young adults, they are bitter - \u201c you should have tried harder\u2026\u201d they don\u2019t maintain close relationships with their AH parents but as a young adult I was supposed to fight for time\u2026. Often the AH nut doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. Walk on and find your own peace.", "NAH, but you're being real harsh. Yeah, it's horrible, it sucks, she shouldn't have done that. But what would happen if she got in contact and your parents found out? I would do so much to have a chance to reconnect with my sister after we fell out, and now she's dead, and I regret it", "NTA-One day you\u2019ll realize that your siblings are the only people on the planet who know what you went thru. They know and understand your POV.", "NAH.  Your sister was trying to survive.  At 12, you couldn't know all that she went through.  Give her a chance.  You sound very angry, which is expected.  But you are directing your anger at another victim, not the perpetrators - your parents.", "Maybe she did not contact you because she felt shame/guilt for leaving you behind.  She could barely take care of herself, she did not want to be dragged back to that situation.", "No one can fault her for leaving or you for feeling abandoned. It's a very complex situation, you don't know what was going on in her head.Try talking to her about the situation and get her point of view. If you don't want to, just go no contact and move on.", "NTA neither is your sister, really... just maybe in denial a bit.", "NTA. It's possible that you may change your mind in the future, but I'd say to do as you wish until then. I don't agree with the majority here and believe she should've reached out to you earlier when it was possible for her. She severed her bond to you as a sister and likely would've ignored you forever had you not run into her out of coincidence.", "NAH.   She chose to save herself, and I don\u2019t think anyone faults her for that.   But yeah.   It feels like she could have stayed in touch - even a little - before now.     She cut ties and moved forward with her life which is apparently what she needed to do, and that\u2019s fine.    But sadly you were one of those ties.\n\nSo very sorry that your parents sucked ,  and that you also lost your older sister because of it.   I hope you and your younger sister are on a healthier path forward.", "If the parents are that abusive they could monitor that sort of communication, and block her or change OP\u2019s email to force no contact. Plus could make things worse for OP and her sister for having that communication.\n\nIf the sister continued after that, the parents could legally go after her for harassment or stalking. That\u2019s also a bad situation.", ">She knew where I go to school and the road that I took each day.\n\nLegally, your parents would have been able to nail her for stalking.", "Many schools would call the police if an adult they don't know anything about just turned up at a school, and then your parents would hear about it.\n\nIt sucks, I am sorry but its inappropriate for an adult to do this.

When you're a kid, you have the family you were born into. Once you're an adult you choose the family you want in your life. If that includes the bio ones, fine. But if not, don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. You do you.", "You are not responsible for your younger sister, and she was not responsible for you.  Your parents were responsible for all of you, and they failed.", ">I turned 18 and had a younger sister and I did not abandon her. That's why I feel our relationship is just irreversibly broken.\n\nAnd I understand why you feel that way, but the fact of the matter is, there is no right or wrong in how either of you chose to deal with the situation. She's not an awful person for abandoning you, and you're not an awful peraon for staying for your sister. \n\nI just want you to think about the things I'm going to say, and I hope you realize that ppl have different ways of internalizing trauma and you can't predict how they're going to react. \n\nLet's say your younger sister comes to realize the sacrifice you've been making for her (assuming she hasn't already). What would you think if she got angry at you for it, and was upset that you put yourself through that for her sake? What if she told you she wished you hadn't done that? Would you be upset? Would you feel sad?\n\nI want you to compare that to what your older sister is feeling now. She had no idea how you would think about her, whether she stayed or left. Either way, she was risking a negative reaction from you. I don't blame her for choosing the option that gave her freedom from your parent's abuse. \n\nI also want you to think about what might have happened, if your sister chose to keep in contact, had your parents found out about it. Do you think your parents would just get mad at her? Or do you think they would have lashed out at you as well? Do you think maybe your sister was trying to protect both herself *and* you by not maintaining contact?\n\nAnd this may be the hardest thing to think about, but aske yourself this: if your parents are not aware that you're staying on behalf of your younger sister but somehow find out, is there a chance their abuse toward the two of you could get worse? Are there any instances where your parents take their anger out on you on your sister instead? You say you're staying so you don't abandon your sister, but are you able to do anything for her in the midst of the abuse?\n\nI think having this mentality of \"my sister abandoned me\" is reasonable, but flawed. Your sister was extremely limited in what she was able to do for you, and frankly, you have no way of knowing if things would have been better had she stayed. You have no way of knowing if she could have protected you or been a source of mental healing for you. You have no idea if she would have crumbled under your parent's abuse and done somethingn awful to herself. \n\nIt kind of sounds like you were expecting her to be this lighthouse in the storm for you, someone to place all your hopes on, but another person just cannot fill that kind of role for you. Your sister simply cannot be your emotional stability or savior.", "Previous poster didn't downplay it.  They rightfully observed it's misdirected.     \n\n\nShe was 18.    OP, you're 21 now.    Believe it or not, ten years from now you're going to look back on this and realize that you're a very young person, and an 18 year old is practically a child.

My point still stands.", "NAH - but OP your anger is misdirected here.   Be angry at your parents.\n\nShe had no power to see you if your parents didn\u2019t want her to see you.

I see you\u2019ve mentioned that your uncle helped her. I take it he was an adult at the time. Where he could tell your parents to kick rocks and continue on with helping you sister. He couldn\u2019t protect YOU from your parents had they found out about the secret communication. Yes he could of told them to kick rocks but realistically in the privacy of your home it would be a different story. I think your sister understood that and did what she felt to protect you. Did you want her to put both of you at mercy of your parents? What\u2019s to say if she didn\u2019t get out when she did she would of taken the other option? I get you\u2019re sticking it out for your little sister but what if your older sister didn\u2019t have that mental capacity to do that when she was 18 for you two? \n\nSomething similar happened with two of my siblings one left when she was 15 and the other at 18 I did see or hear from either of them for 8+ years because they were avoiding seeing our \u201cparents\u201d Our parents would make up the worst stories about both of them. I understood; we didn\u2019t see each other again in person until our youngest sibling passed of an overdose. It brought up a lot of this between us and talking it through has been the best thing for us. I\u2019m not super close to either of them but we do stay in touch and check in more often now.", "NTA, but you probably need to re-evaluate your decision. You understand the situation,  but she was wrong and just made a bad decision where you and your sister were concerned. Being older, she regrets it and apologized. You seem to still be hurt and feel abandoned at that time by your sister. Completely understandable,  but children raised that way, don't make good decisions when trying to escape. Life is along time, and it sounds like your sister wants to reconnect with the good parts of her family,  you and your sister. She was young, dumb, traumatized and didn't make the right decision. Being away from the situation,  she probably grew and recognized her mistake in not keeping in contact with you and your sister. Go to family counseling and maybe develop that relationship and forgive her. It will help you as well.", "There's no AH here.\nBut I can't even imagine how difficult your older sister's life must have been.\nYou should try.. for you.", "The issue isn't her leaving, OP says she understands that her sister had to get the hell out of dodge. The issue is her not bothering to contact OP in the 10 years she was gone. Surely, at some point after you'd got yourself established you'd reach out to your sisters who couldn't escape with you. The only excuse for that I could ever see would be getting in contact with OP without going through their parents could be hard, and that would only be the case of their parents religiously checked their phone.", "OP, you aren't the AH, but you could be missing out. You sound hurt and unwilling to give it a try.  People can change.  Hopefully others will be more merciful with you.", "The annoying part is the sister asking \"how did we end up here\" as if the answer isn't kind of evident", "yeah, just a sad and hard position. She did what she had to do, but can't expect to just come back for a relationship now. It was the best for the sister, but OP can't erase how they feel about it. If OP does want to rebuild the relationship, should be on their terms.", "There\u2019s plenty of parents who would beat any information out of their younger kids if the eldest ran away. \n\nShe could have very well not contacted her sisters out of fear that they\u2019d be physically harmed for communicating with her. \n\nThe fact that she waited until OP was 19 and presumably on her own before reaching out was probably to protect her sisters.", "I am imagining that the thought of anything to do with the home she grew up in (even reaching out to contact her sisters) was stress-inducing and therefore she avoided it. I can understand that. The only AH here are the parents.", "Sister left with OP was 12. Bet OP didn\u2019t have a cell phone. How was her sister supposed to reach out to a child without contacting the abusive parents?? \n\nHow could the sister be sure that reaching out wouldn\u2019t put her into a shitty situation?? \n\nOPs feelings are valid. But hopefully she will move past them.", "> She did not want to take any risks.\n\nYou recognize it was a risk, so why are you expecting someone who is fleeing abuse to take risks?", "My suggestion is therapy. She was in an untenable situation, and unfortunately, it hurt you deeply when she left. You are too hurt to see that she didn't have a choice. Your sister also escaped a trauma and has lingering feelings as well. Your feelings are valid, BUT so are hers. I don't think either of you will see the other person's point of view without help. And please bring your little sister too because I'm certain she has her own feelings and trauma from this situation that are separate from both of you. \nNAH except the parents", "You should add it to the post. This is important.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  you have every right to be angry. Especially for she could have contacted you through your uncle. Being abandoned is extremely painful and traumatic, even more so when it comes from someone you thought cared.", "It looks like your sister was scared for her life. We don't know what she had to endure, probably same as you and even worse since she was the oldest... And personal experience says the older ones take the hardest toll\nI dont blame you if you don't want a relationship with her. But you can't blame her for what she did if you dont know the whole picture, how she felt, and why she felt that way. You are resenting her for the terrible fear she felt for your parents..", "OP feels abandoned. She has every right to not talk to someone who, intentionally or not, probably added to her trauma.", "That\u2019s true, OP sister was protecting her mental health by leaving", "She can be angry at both her sister and her parents, it's not mutually exclusive.\n\nObviously their parents are TA here but OP has every right to be angry at her sister. They were both in an incredibly traumatic situation and the sister had every right to leave, and from the sisters perspective she may have had a very good reason not to contact OP during that period.\n\nBut she still left and cut off contact for a decade. Regardless of the reason, OP has every right to feel hurt and angry about that.", "Reckon you're more pissed that she escaped and left you with your parents. You know that she had no other choice, she didn't abandon you, she saved herself. Maybe direct your anger at your actual abusers instead of their victims.", "So, you\u2019re saying, you feel safe enough to continue living with your parents? That\u2019s great. Your sister did not. You may need to accept that more or different things happened to her, or she just reacted differently.", "Regardless the sister made a choice and has no right to be upset, at all, if OP doesn\u2019t want to be near her because of said choice.", "This right here.", "She didn\u2019t say that she felt safe enough to continuing living with her parents.\n\nIt\u2019s that to her, her personal safety comes second to making sure her younger sibling is safe and cared for.", "Are you even sure that she was in the same town? Did you ask what she was doing during that time? Maybe she couldn\u2019t come see you at lunch be cause she was at work, trying to pay for a roof over her head. As a much older sister, I can promise her experience was different from yours. Even in a healthy home, the oldest has more pressure, more responsibility and more expectations on them. If you have even a single memory of her trying to protect you, then you can trust that she did it multiple times. She may wish that she had done things differently now, but at the time she did what she had to do to protect herself. She was in no position to take you both with her. You don\u2019t have to be friends with her, but it may be worth it to see if she will go to a counselling session with you so that you can both try to gain each others perspective.", "That\u2019s not how it works. If OP gets to be upset (which I said was ok) then sister Also gets to be upset.  And the youngest gets to be upset at OP too if she wants later on!"]}
