He's literally reneging on the plans you made over a month ago and she's siding with him? Is she doing the pub crawl too?", "This is  a NTA from me. You had your plans made before his, he had presumably agreed to this and then reneged. I'm going to assume your friend is a mother of a 6 month old as well....if no then they can heck off with their opinion.", "NTA. OP pay close attention to this behavior and consider if this will continue into the marriage. \n\nWill he always sacrifice your one day and special plans for a party with his buddies? He\u2019s telling you that his plans are more important than you and your son. Will he continue not to prioritize you and your happiness? Will he not compromise or collaborate with you on issues and just tell you what he\u2019s doing instead?", "NTA - You made your plans first and he agreed. Now he's all but backing out, waiting to see how he feels the day of. This is not a responsible parent. He should have planned his club crawl for another day.", "NTA in my opinion, you made your plans first and your fianc\u00e9 should honour that. Sure he may not get to see his friends often (and you\u2019ve not said to him he can\u2019t see them, just not to go crazy on the alcohol)- but how often are you going to try on a wedding dress and have a tea party? That\u2019s usually a once in a lifetime thing. You don\u2019t want to spend that day worrying about your child. I\u2019ve got a son around the same age and from a parent\u2019s POV, it\u2019s not fun trying to enjoy yourself but also worrying about your child\u2019s needs.", "NTA! He made a commitment to you. It's very fair to feel uncomfortable that a six month old might be in the hands of a very hungover and sleepy person.  I don't understand why he thinks this would be ok. Why can't he reschedule with his friends? A night out is easier to reschedule than an event planned months ago for multiple people.", "Nta\n\nHe made a commitment. Getting drunk with friends does not take precedence over looking after his own child.", "Nta. He made a commitment to you to look after his child for the day, and needs to put his sons safety first. He should rearrange his friends outing.", "NTA. He promised to take the baby for the day and now he is backing out. Seeing his friends is important, but so is his promise to you.

Let taking care of your son be his problem for one day.", "NTA\n\nIf it comes up again, just remind him that you already made a prior commitment, and you expect him to keep it.

He shouldn\u2019t need to drink to hang out with his friends, or at least, if he absolutely has to drink he doesn\u2019t need to drink much.", "NTA - it's one day you've had planned for a while, much longer than his night out. If he wants to go out without worry, then he should organise someone trusted to help him out the next day.", "NTA he had agreed to watch your son way before he made plans with his friends and it\u2019s unfair of him to now be mad at you for holding him accountable for something he had agreed to do and much less have a poor excuse to not wanting to now.", "NTA - This is his child too and should be more important than getting so drunk that he\u2019s unable to be a father for one single day.\n\nYou need to make boundaries now, and make him understand his responsibilities before it falls down to you for the entirety of your son\u2019s childhood.", "Nta and red flags", "NTA. He's a father now. Like it or not, that means life has to change. Being invited out for a couple of drinks is one thing but a pub crawl starting at 2pm (meaning many hours of drinking) when he's already made a prior commitment to take the baby for the day? Nuh uh. And trying to make you look like the bad guy when he's the one breaking the promise...I'm extremely suss of the fact that his friends just coincidentally happened to organise it on the same day and he's like but you know I never get to go out anymore so don't get up my ass about this\n\nI see in your comment this would have been the first time he'd be 'babysitting' (I hate that term for dads looking after their kids but wouldn't be surprised if that's how he'd call it) in your son's entire life? None of this bodes well AT ALL", "NTA, but maybe consider if you really want to marry someone who is always going to prioritize himself over you and your child.", "NTA, but do NOT take your son with him. The chance he learns his lesson is way higher if he has to deal with the baby when hangover. \n\nIf you think he will not take care of your son properly (hangover or not), don't marry this guy bc then he is just a loser dad. Single parents and single moms are taking good care of their kids and newborns all the time, even if they are sick or still feeling unwell after birth so a little hangover is no reason for not taking care of his child. If he is not home till you need to leave, i would let him know that he doesn't have to come home anymore, you take your son with you and expect him to be gone till you return in the evening - on the other hand, if this happens there is no need to try on the weddingdress bc you - at least i hope so - wouldn't marry him anymore anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It shouldn\u2019t be that difficult for a grown man to tell his friends he has a prior commitment and can\u2019t do the pub crawl that day, and ask if they could do it on a different day. I suspect your man is getting nervous about getting married and living the husband/dad life so he is asserting his \u201cbachelorhood\u201d\u2026much like a toddler who insists they aren\u2019t sleepy when clearly they need to go to bed.\n\nTake a moment and explain to him that you are happy for him to go on a pub crawl with his friends, but he made a prior commitment to you and he should honor it. This is a trust issue. How are you to trust his word when he backs out like this? Good luck, and I hope everything works out. I bet your dress is gorgeous and you\u2019ll be a beautiful bride!", "Bro come on even if his plans were made before yours shouldn\u2019t taking care of HIS CHILD be more important??

I see a large dose of foreshadowing here.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with your friend on the fact that you should absolutely take your son in this situation if your fianc\u00e9 is insisting on not being in a fit state to parent, but your fianc\u00e9 should not be putting you in that situation to begin with. \n\nBeing a good partner is about honoring commitments, communication, and sometimes sacrifice, which he\u2019s clearly not able to do. Parenting is about showing up and taking care, even when it sucks and it messes up your plans, which he is also clearly unwilling to do. \n\nY\u2019all need to have a serious talk about your relationship and his role as a father moving forward if this is the attitude he takes toward both roles.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu should have organized a babysitter instead of harassing your partner because he is doing waht was planned.", "NTA.

He can't monitor the amount he drinks?\n\n\nThe only way I might be able to give him a bit of a pass for trying to renage on plans...are these friends people he hasn't seen in months who are celebrating something special? And even so, he should be able to manage without getting wasted. \n\n\nIs he actually a devoted, supportive father in general?

Good luck.", "Someone else commented that OP\u2019s friend\u2019s opinion really doesn\u2019t matter unless she also has a 6 month old child. So I\u2019m betting that friend doesn\u2019t and does not understand what having the son there would be like and how it would change the dynamic.\n\nPlus it\u2019s just the principle of the thing.

You need common sense and to pay attention.", "Note: when he is in charge of the baby and asks what to do, instead of telling him, *ask* him, \u201cwhat do *you* think\u201d (not sarcastically, just making him turn on his brain).", "He can't manage.

Father of the year -.-", "NTA. You had your plans first, he needs to honour them. But if he gives you a day off, then you definitely owe him one in return. Parents both need breaks.

This man is not mature enough for a child, marriage or even an adult relationship.", "OP, it's not farfetched to wonder whether he deliberately encouraged scheduling the pub crawl for that date in order to make a point / be unable to follow through on childcare. \n\nThink about what that says about him, his respect for you / things he promises you, and his responsibility toward your child.", "NTA\nFirst off, unless your friend is a Mom, she doesn't get to make a judgement. She's not in your shoes, isn't juggling a baby and wedding planning. Second, stand your ground. Make it very clear to your fiance that you will be going to your tea party, you will be leaving the baby with him and he needs to suck it up. This has been planned for a while.

Do not hope that he will somehow just understand at some point. People rarely change if they think the status quo benefits them and \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d usually has little resonance. \n\nWhatever his reasons are (I wouldn\u2019t care but YMMV), you can calmly set clear expectations about sharing responsibility. Expect him to learn how to do things if he says he doesn\u2019t know how (and having a vagina doesn\u2019t mean you know about childcare\u2014women have to learn this stuff too). If he argues with you, don\u2019t engage, just simply repeat that you expect him to do A, B, C and enforce it. \n\nDo not get married during this period and recognize that he could step up temporarily and then backslide, repeatedly.
