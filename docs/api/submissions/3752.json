OP pay close attention to this behavior and consider if this will continue into the marriage. \n\nWill he always sacrifice your one day and special plans for a party with his buddies?

Now he's all but backing out, waiting to see how he feels the day of. This is not a responsible parent.

Sure he may not get to see his friends often (and you\u2019ve not said to him he can\u2019t see them, just not to go crazy on the alcohol)- but how often are you going to try on a wedding dress and have a tea party? That\u2019s usually a once in a lifetime thing. You don\u2019t want to spend that day worrying about your child. I\u2019ve got a son around the same age and from a parent\u2019s POV, it\u2019s not fun trying to enjoy yourself but also worrying about your child\u2019s needs.", "NTA! He made a commitment to you. It's very fair to feel uncomfortable that a six month old might be in the hands of a very hungover and sleepy person.  I don't understand why he thinks this would be ok. Why can't he reschedule with his friends? A night out is easier to reschedule than an event planned months ago for multiple people.", "Nta\n\nHe made a commitment. Getting drunk with friends does not take precedence over looking after his own child.", "Nta. He made a commitment to you to look after his child for the day, and needs to put his sons safety first.

If he wants to go out without worry, then he should organise someone trusted to help him out the next day.", "NTA he had agreed to watch your son way before he made plans with his friends and it\u2019s unfair of him to now be mad at you for holding him accountable for something he had agreed to do and much less have a poor excuse to not wanting to now.", "NTA - This is his child too and should be more important than getting so drunk that he\u2019s unable to be a father for one single day.\n\nYou need to make boundaries now, and make him understand his responsibilities before it falls down to you for the entirety of your son\u2019s childhood.", "Nta and red flags", "NTA.

Being invited out for a couple of drinks is one thing but a pub crawl starting at 2pm (meaning many hours of drinking) when he's already made a prior commitment to take the baby for the day? Nuh uh. And trying to make you look like the bad guy when he's the one breaking the promise...I'm extremely suss of the fact that his friends just coincidentally happened to organise it on the same day and he's like but you know I never get to go out anymore so don't get up my ass about this\n\nI see in your comment this would have been the first time he'd be 'babysitting' (I hate that term for dads looking after their kids but wouldn't be surprised if that's how he'd call it) in your son's entire life? None of this bodes well AT ALL", "NTA, but maybe consider if you really want to marry someone who is always going to prioritize himself over you and your child.", "NTA, but do NOT take your son with him. The chance he learns his lesson is way higher if he has to deal with the baby when hangover. \n\nIf you think he will not take care of your son properly (hangover or not), don't marry this guy bc then he is just a loser dad. Single parents and single moms are taking good care of their kids and newborns all the time, even if they are sick or still feeling unwell after birth so a little hangover is no reason for not taking care of his child. If he is not home till you need to leave, i would let him know that he doesn't have to come home anymore, you take your son with you and expect him to be gone till you return in the evening - on the other hand, if this happens there is no need to try on the weddingdress bc you - at least i hope so - wouldn't marry him anymore anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It shouldn\u2019t be that difficult for a grown man to tell his friends he has a prior commitment and can\u2019t do the pub crawl that day, and ask if they could do it on a different day.

This won\u2019t be the only time this happens. NTA", "NTA - your post makes me believe that you do the majority of the work with your son and your fiance does very little. Not only does that make me incredibly sad, but this is a definite sign of things to come. You'll be doing a majority of the parenting for the next 17 and 1/2 years. This entire situation would give me serious pause as to whether or not my soon to be spouse actually respects me and honors my time. It sounds to me like he's being incredibly selfish by scheduling over plans you already had.\n\nBest of luck. I would not marry this guy.", "Y-T-A to yourself and your child for having a baby and getting engaged to such a person.  Just why?", "xj,k,l", "Speaking as a problematic occasional binge drinker, I have zero interest in drinking anything less than 6 or 7 drinks, which is a real problem, since I tend to black out if I go much past that.  I have mostly quit, because I recognize that this is a problem.\n\nSometimes I binge because I'm stressed and need a break. Other times, I want to dip my toes in self-destruction without causing obvious, permanent harm.  Either way, it's not about fun.  But a few drinks doesn't seem to scratch either itch.\n\nNo idea why OP's fiance needs to get drunk.  I daresay there are a lot of different reasons.", "OP, what you need to say to him is, \"Do what you want the day beforehand, but you'll be taking care of our son whether you're hungover or not, so I don't want to hear any complaints. Whatever you do, you're doing to yourself. And if you're not able to take care of our son, we're going to have a serious issue.\"\n\nAlso, OP, have a serious conversation with him. None of this is okay. You're not a bad guy for telling him to act like an adult and partner.", "Well I didn\u2019t think it\u2019ll be like this once the child was born, through promises we\u2019d do it together and he has my back and all of that", "And you\u2019re still planning to marry him? He\u2019s not even capable of being a father to his own child for one day.", "Yes, he\u2019s okay with \u201cbabysitting\u201d until something more fun comes along and then he shoves his child off on OP", "[deleted]", "You have the baby but do you really want to legally tied to a man who pawns off his kid to his parents when you're sick? Who bails when he's meant to parent his own child? \n\nRUN NOW\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t know if anyone has said it, but if you can\u2019t get your child\u2019s father to take care of him for one day\u2026..you shouldn\u2019t marry him. He knew the date. He knew that you were depending on him to care for his own son, and he made other arrangements because he doesn\u2019t care how you feel about having a day to celebrate with the other women in your life.", "NTA for what you stated but why are you marrying such a selfish person?", "NTA Can't fathom a \"good man\" would answer like he did or a happy relationship", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is selfish as heck. I\u2019d be furious.", "This is a big red flag.  He can't enjoy a night out with his friends without getting so drunk he can't take care of his kid?  Just no.\n\nNTA", "This is a huge red flag - I would not move forward with marrying him until this issue gets resolved with counseling etc.", "Right- I didn\u2019t suggest OP change her plans, nor do I think she should. I 100% think dad needs to grow up and take care of his child and his commitment. He can go drinking with his friends some other time. Or he can go with them this time and drink responsibly or be the designated driver so he\u2019s sober and functional when it\u2019s time to take care of his own child."]}
