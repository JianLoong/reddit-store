You should visit each other coworker and express concern for their sentiment-- not because the concern likely has any merit, but to call out the potential gas lighter for trying to use the opinion of your coworkers as a cudgel. If necessary, you can address any concerns about the potential for sexual harassment.\n2. You should consider contacting HR about the accusation and seek remediation assistance. Accusations of sexual harassment can be made by anyone, even bystanders. You will want to try to get ahead of this in case your (older) co-worker is even more petty than your story makes her out to be. If HR knows that your wife is fully knowledgeable and supportive of your adoptive parenting behavior, no accusations made later will have any merit.\n\nAs an older person with the ability to feed others, there is a natural power imbalance between you and the daughter-at-work you've adopted. Others may apply their own interpretation for the reasons you are generous. Protecting someone younger against predatory behavior could ennoble the busy body's incursion into something that is otherwise none of her business.\n\nIf everything is on the up and up, you have nothing to fear by going to HR, except maybe they might decide that the younger employee shouldn't be accepting meals from older employees. And ultimately, she's not your daughter and as an adult she should be responsible for feeding herself.

It's not fair to for one person to get free food when others don't. (1) Ask her if she's also feels entitled to a share of others' lottery winnings, church donations, and the gifts given to less well-off families at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The entities who give away those free things are established to do just that. You are just a guy doing a nice thing for one person. Before she feels entitled to jump on your gravy train, she needs to explain to these organizations that do charitable work that she feels that if anyone else receives a kindness, she should also receive the same. (2) Ask her to walk around to your other co-workers and have whoever also feels entitled to free food to say so in front of both you and her. Tell her until she actually does both of those things, she needs to stop trying to force you into providing her meals. If she hadn't wanted something, she could have asked. You probably would have happily obliged... before she made such a jerk of herself.\n2.
