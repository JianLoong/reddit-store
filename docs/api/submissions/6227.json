You should visit each other coworker and express concern for their sentiment-- not because the concern likely has any merit, but to call out the potential gas lighter for trying to use the opinion of your coworkers as a cudgel. If necessary, you can address any concerns about the potential for sexual harassment.\n2. You should consider contacting HR about the accusation and seek remediation assistance. Accusations of sexual harassment can be made by anyone, even bystanders. You will want to try to get ahead of this in case your (older) co-worker is even more petty than your story makes her out to be. If HR knows that your wife is fully knowledgeable and supportive of your adoptive parenting behavior, no accusations made later will have any merit.\n\nAs an older person with the ability to feed others, there is a natural power imbalance between you and the daughter-at-work you've adopted. Others may apply their own interpretation for the reasons you are generous.
