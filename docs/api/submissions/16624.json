Happiness is not something you can gift someone who refuses it.\n\nI'm going to make a really big jump into illogic here, but after reading enough reddit to realize that some people are entitled and demanding to a delusional degree, could she possibly have convinced herself into thinking that she wouldn't have to give the car back afterwards because it now has sentimental value to her as her wedding/honeymoon/new bride car and you should just go get yourself a different one because you can't take it away from her now?

You could try and spin it as concerns about all of the above if you think that would help avoid a meltdown on her part. But you're under no obligation to, no means no.\n\nMost wedding cars that are rented out do not expect the bride to drive them (the car's owner doesn't usually trust randos to drive a swanky car for the first time on their wedding day!), so she's going to struggle to find someone to accommodate that.", "NTA.
