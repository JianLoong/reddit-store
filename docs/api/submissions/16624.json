Is she getting married in a drive-thru or Sonic or something?", "NTA\n\nShe's allowed to ask once, and of course you are allowed to say no. Harassing you about it is ridiculous and inappropriate, especially when you are making such kind offers of driving her or renting a nice car.\n\nYou are not going to be able to make her happy regardless of how hard you try as she has chosen to be unhappy regardless of how reasonable and kind everyone else is being. Happiness is not something you can gift someone who refuses it.\n\nI'm going to make a really big jump into illogic here, but after reading enough reddit to realize that some people are entitled and demanding to a delusional degree, could she possibly have convinced herself into thinking that she wouldn't have to give the car back afterwards because it now has sentimental value to her as her wedding/honeymoon/new bride car and you should just go get yourself a different one because you can't take it away from her now? Otherwise, a rental car would be the same as using your car, unless the end goal is not the car but being able to force your compliance.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if the car is destroyed?

Tell her she can rent your car for 2x the deductible. That way you can for sure afford to get it repaired if she gets in an accident.\n\nWhen she refuses, tell her she's the only one \"ruining\" her wedding. She's paying for the other aspects, right? Dress. Venue. Reception. Having to pay for the use of your car isn't any different except for the fact that she's trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA The only one \"ruining\" your sister's wedding is your sister.

She also won't get a chance to practice driving in her shoes and dress - if it's got a train on it, a big skirt or a wiggle skirt she won't be able to drive at all.\n\nYou are offering to be her personal chauffeur on the day by bringing her to and from the wedding, this is a service a lot of people pay good money for! You could try and spin it as concerns about all of the above if you think that would help avoid a meltdown on her part. But you're under no obligation to, no means no.\n\nMost wedding cars that are rented out do not expect the bride to drive them (the car's owner doesn't usually trust randos to drive a swanky car for the first time on their wedding day!), so she's going to struggle to find someone to accommodate that.", "NTA. If she likes yours so much she can rent one like it. Borrowing cars is a hard no from me. Too many things can go wrong.", "NTA \n\nTell her it\u2019s her car and you need it EVERYDAY.

IMO,  the marriage is already ruined if they are that shallow and focused on the trivial things.", ">She's even gone as far as to guilt trip me by saying that I'm ruining her wedding day and that I don't care about her happiness.\n\nShrug.

Being family does not mean she can use your property whenever she wants.", "Where do people get ideas like this? The entitlement runs deep with this bride.", "Listen, when an adult learns that the solution to their problem is not realistic, they look for another solution instead of blaming and guilt tripping.

Stay strong OP!", "Your sister is an entitled brat and you\u2019re not obligated to lend her your car. Say no one more time and then ignore her if she brings it up again.
