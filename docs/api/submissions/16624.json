Is she getting married in a drive-thru or Sonic or something?", "NTA\n\nShe's allowed to ask once, and of course you are allowed to say no. Harassing you about it is ridiculous and inappropriate, especially when you are making such kind offers of driving her or renting a nice car.\n\nYou are not going to be able to make her happy regardless of how hard you try as she has chosen to be unhappy regardless of how reasonable and kind everyone else is being. Happiness is not something you can gift someone who refuses it.\n\nI'm going to make a really big jump into illogic here, but after reading enough reddit to realize that some people are entitled and demanding to a delusional degree, could she possibly have convinced herself into thinking that she wouldn't have to give the car back afterwards because it now has sentimental value to her as her wedding/honeymoon/new bride car and you should just go get yourself a different one because you can't take it away from her now? Otherwise, a rental car would be the same as using your car, unless the end goal is not the car but being able to force your compliance.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if the car is destroyed?

No is a full sentence and the fact that she is not accepting that answer shows her lack of respect for you and your person. \n\nIf she tries to guilt you again, counter it with that.", "NTA. You were very gracious to offer to drive her or rent another car for her.", ">She's even gone as far as to guilt trip me by saying that I'm ruining her wedding day and that I don't care about her happiness.\n\nShe's being emotionally abusive.\n\nWhat's the deductible on your car insurance policy? Tell her she can rent your car for 2x the deductible. That way you can for sure afford to get it repaired if she gets in an accident.\n\nWhen she refuses, tell her she's the only one \"ruining\" her wedding. She's paying for the other aspects, right? Dress. Venue. Reception. Having to pay for the use of your car isn't any different except for the fact that she's trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA The only one \"ruining\" your sister's wedding is your sister. You offered her other options and she declined. Your sister is acting like a spoiled and entitled bridezilla.", "NTA - Sister is going to be stressed as hell on her wedding day (after getting ready, hair, markup, putting on the dress, chasing up flowers for herself and bridesmaids, etc, even if someone else is taking care of it all, it's stressful!). She also won't get a chance to practice driving in her shoes and dress - if it's got a train on it, a big skirt or a wiggle skirt she won't be able to drive at all.\n\nYou are offering to be her personal chauffeur on the day by bringing her to and from the wedding, this is a service a lot of people pay good money for! You could try and spin it as concerns about all of the above if you think that would help avoid a meltdown on her part. But you're under no obligation to, no means no.\n\nMost wedding cars that are rented out do not expect the bride to drive them (the car's owner doesn't usually trust randos to drive a swanky car for the first time on their wedding day!), so she's going to struggle to find someone to accommodate that.", "NTA. If she likes yours so much she can rent one like it. Borrowing cars is a hard no from me. Too many things can go wrong.", "NTA \n\nTell her it\u2019s her car and you need it EVERYDAY. Because she drives like a heathen, she can\u2019t use it for her one day.", "NTA. Lordy, save us all from these entitled brides who say their weddings will be ruined if they don't get X, Y, or Z!  IMO,  the marriage is already ruined if they are that shallow and focused on the trivial things.", ">She's even gone as far as to guilt trip me by saying that I'm ruining her wedding day and that I don't care about her happiness.\n\nShrug.

If the most important part of her wedding day is driving your car the wedding needs to be canceled.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to use your stuff. Even if they are family.", "NTA. Weddings involve alcohol. Cars and alcohol don't mix. She is out of line with the guilt. Stick to your guns.", "She wants to drive your car to the wedding?  Lol  why would she be driving?  Is it to make a presentation of her arrival, driving herself?  If you are ok offering with you driving tell her that\u2019s your only offer. Brides don\u2019t get to be dictators.", "She says that since I\u2019m her sister she deserves to use the car. I feel bad because I know she likes the car but I have seen how she drives and it stresses me out.", "NTA\n\nNever loan a car to someone not on the insurance.

Being family does not mean she can use your property whenever she wants.", "Where do people get ideas like this? The entitlement runs deep with this bride.", "Listen, when an adult learns that the solution to their problem is not realistic, they look for another solution instead of blaming and guilt tripping. You even offered to rent a car for her which is generous enough to overlook whatever opinion (but prolly deserved) you have on her driving.", "Putting aside potential damage to your car, for liability reasons alone after an event where she is likely to have been drinking, I wouldn\u2019t let her borrow your car.\n\nETA - for both yours and her sake.", "Ahhh she wants to drive your car and this is her best chance at getting it. Stay strong OP!", "Your sister is an entitled brat and you\u2019re not obligated to lend her your car. Say no one more time and then ignore her if she brings it up again. Make sure your keys aren\u2019t in a place where she can\u2019t get to them because if she has a chance to she\u2019ll take it out for a joyride.", "Hold your ground. If you not letting her borrow your car ruins her wedding day, then maybe she shouldn't get married. Clearly, her marriage is doomed", "I've never seen a bride drive herself to her own wedding? It's more luxurious to be driven and people would likely judge her the other way.  \n\nNTA. You've offered a good compromise.", "Her explanation makes no sense at all, which is another red flag. Brides driving themselves around a wedding isn't a thing. I can totally see her keeping your car and pretending it's a wedding present. Don't let her near it.", "Then she's ridiculous!

Or that she wants to drive herself to or from her wedding either.", "She has been a little dramatic about the wedding and wants it to be her perfect day. I get that but my car is important to me and I love it.", "NTA   \nI see a wedding about every 3 or 4 weeks as there is a small church right across the road from my house.

(I always wonder how often I am in the backgrounds of wedding photos).   \n\n\nThe older cars - like the 1950's Rolls royces are always driven by the owners (as they stand outside the church during the wedding as they know no one - I often wonder over and talk to them about their cars, as they are their pride and joy).   \n\n\nI am not surprised that the bride wants to go to her wedding on Ops car. \n\nI am surprised that she didn't want her brother driving her to the church, which to me seems a nice touch.   \nI am surprised (annoyed) that she thinks not getting her way with this car is going to ruin her wedding (manipulating Op).   \n\n\nOp - what sort of car is it ?", "Idk what to tell you- she really likes this car and wants to take it because it\u2019s \u201cluxury\u201d.", " No is a complete sentence. Quit letting your sister walk all over you.", "I get it. I have a sports car. I don't think my sister would even ask to drive it.  Her driving record is much worse. I've driven hers a few times, but I'm not too comfortable letting others drive mine. Since I've had it, I let 1 friend drive it to the gas station for a test drive (I was with him). My dad recently drove it about 3 miles from the tire shop to my job. I'd let my dad drive it if he wanted, but he has a squeaky clean driving record with no accidents. My mom and sister are very much not the same.", "It's a BMW 7 series. Not a Ferrari, not a MacLaren, not the Batmobile, not an antique, not anything special. \n\nAnd even if it were, what bride is *driving herself* in her wedding dress and shoes? Come on.", "In all the wedding I have seen I have never seen one where the bride drove herself. I have seen many where it takes 3 or 4 people to help the bride out of the car with the dress and everything.   \n\n\nOne wedding I was a guest at (friend of the groom) - the bride arrived in a horse drawn carriage that the bride's father had built just for the wedding. It was pretty cool and unexpected.   \n\n\nMaybe offer to make a hand made horse drawn cart for your sister /JK", ">In all the wedding I have seen I have never seen one where the bride drove herself.\n\nI have once, a self-described \"strong independent woman\".  \nAnd she still is.
