I'm not great at story telling all cool or anything I just want to know if this is productive or ONLY petty?\n\nI often find myself cooking dinner for both of us most nights. (Which I will say I don't mind, I love cooking very much but this is really killing my passion for making a nice meal for us to share.) My Husband (Connor) will not help me clean up the kitchen after cooking. I typically clean as I go anyways so there are not many dishes by the end. However ANY pot or pan I will have to clean as he says - he didnt ask me to cook so why should he clean the cookware - very mature I know....\n\nWhile that is just rather disrespectful I feel, Connor also very often won't even clean the plate he just ate off that night either. He will just throw it into the sink and leave it there for DAYS. He won't get to it the next day or anything like that. I haven't seen the bottom of the sink in weeks. WEEKS, no joke. I'll go to the sink after eating and wash my plate and put it up to dry but he'll just leave his in the sink. So it's not like he doesn't have a visual reminder and literally see the couple of SECONDS it takes to do.\n\nAnytime I ask him to clean some of his dishes or point out the sink is full of all of his dishes he gets defensive. He'll bring up everything I've ever done that does not meet his expectations, he's really text book deflection and really annoying.\n\nWe're at the point that we're running out of clean dishware because he is using and leaving more dirty dishes than cleaning them. I've tried many time just doing his dishes for him like a mother but it doesn't change anything, I don't even get a thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here lies AITA ... I want to clean the dishes but then .... hide alllllll of them except for like one plate or one bowl so he HAS to clean to clean up after himself.\n\n\\-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*-\\*  \nKinda Update: I've realized from a lot of y'all I should stick with the being the adult route. I'm sure I've mentioned plenty of times for him to be better about this but I think a proper quick and as hard as it will be to calm the rage in my soul haha a friendly conversation about making a list of our expectations for our house hold responsibilities. We won't be home together til later this evening but I'll update with how the talk goes.\n\nAlso a lot of y'all were asking - We both work full time - We share bills 50/50 - he does his laundry I do my laundry - the only chore he does around the house is sometimes trash and on occasion.. like every couple months he'll vacuum or also rarely wash our sheets . I do all other cleaning in every room.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697120284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17682er/wibta_for_telling_my_husband31_m_i_29_f_wont_cook/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know that's not the case here since you clean as you cook, but still, that concept shouldn't be forgotten in a lot of cases.\n\nBut being unwilling to even clean up after himself, at the most basic level?

Now when I want to eat, I have to clean if I haven't already. Same goes for pans etc. You know what? It worked! I'm living with my boyfriend now, a full set of things to eat off. Usually I leave stuff in the sink and clean it the next day while I'm making food. This system works for me and I clean as I go as well. I work from home, my boyfriend works on site so it makes sense for me to take over some of the chores. I do them when I can. It's working for us.  If I cook, he cleans and vice versa, sometimes I do both and sometimes he does. We don't make a fuss about it. \n\nYears ago I lived with my ex and it was a huge mess in the kitchen. He wanted me to cook and I just couldn't, I always had to spend ages cleaning before I could even start. I just couldn't do it. I wanted a clean kitchen, but every time I cleaned it, it was a mess again within a few days. When I tried to cook, I had a backseat cook (my boyfriend knows to not do that or I'll just stop cooking, because I have my own methods that work for me) and things had to be done a certain way. This issue was both of us and when we split up and were still sharing the house, the kitchen was tidy because we both somehow were able to keep it clean. I'm still confused how that worked. We were not a good team. \n\nI'd remove all the extra plates etc and when you make food, have him serve himself. If his plate isn't clean, he'll have to clean it. This is the way to train yourself to do the dishes, especially if you have adhd (not saying he does, but it will force his brain to get used to cleaning, which will make life easier for both of you). Take care of your own stuff for now. If he doesn't want to clean still, well he won't get to eat. Simple as that. It may take a few days/weeks but it will sink in. It's fair. Hell, if you want him to learn how to cook, stop cooking for him. Eventually he'll have to make himself food and he'll learn. \n\nI'm saying this as someone who has gone through this myself, as the lazy person. It wasn't 100% my fault but I didn't help the situation because I didn't know how to get myself to deal with it back then. I didn't know I had adhd, I had zero coping mechanisms or workarounds. I do now, not medicated either, just trained myself to deal with things. Timers help as well, but that's for a later, hence why I wash up while I'm waiting for my food to cook.

Absolutely not--any relationship that devolves to \"score keeping\" [which, btw, he's kinda doing to you with his rebuttals] will usually just keep right on devolving.\n\nBut sometimes a little petty gets the point across so you can both go back to adulting.

Keep it away from him. Only wash your items. If he runs out, he runs out.\n\nAt this point in my marriage, some fights aren't worth it. Not that I don't care, but that I am okay letting my husband figure it out by what I don't do than by screaming (after telling him multiple times my expectations and having discussions).

He didn\u2019t ask you to cook, so why make him a portion.\n\nAlso, it sounds like the switch up has happened, he thinks you\u2019re trapped so he\u2019s gonna try to turn you into his mommy", "NTA good luck, but I think you'd be happier if you got a divorce. You don't deserve to have to carry his dead weight for the rest of your life. He is an adult, but acts like your child at home.

I don't have time to read it all. Personally, I would cook dinner and not give him any. My answer would be I didn't ask you to eat any, did I?", ">I'm sure I've mentioned plenty of times for him to be better about this but I think a proper quick and as hard as it will be to calm the rage in my soul haha a friendly conversation about making a list of our expectations for our house hold responsibilities\n\nOmg maybe I missed the comments that said this, But I'm pretty sure everyone said to stop cooking for him.\n\nThis isn't a communication issue. You said it a million times, and even without saying it it's pretty obvious to clean your fucking disgusting dishes after weeks of it sitting there.\n\nHE DOESN'T CARE.\n\nBecause you always pick up his slack. \n\nPlease for the love of God stop cooking for him. \n\nHe doesn't care.\n\nHe doesn't care what you say, because you always cave and give him what he wants. He never has to change because you're never going to leave him no matter how shittily he treats you.\n\nNTA if you actually genuinely addressed this issue by taking concrete steps. Concrete steps aren't repeating for the millionth time for him to clean, or even a making a chore chart of something he's deliberately throwing the middle finger at you about, but to stop cooking when he doesn't clean and to take steps to leave someone who treats you like this.\n\nYou need to genuinely understand he does not care about you enough to respect you. This comes from a deep pit of disrespect where he knows you're never going to leave him, You're never going to actually stand up for yourself, And you're always going to cave for his wants.\n\nYou say you feel rage about this yet You seem to meekly be going along with this. Which is kind of ironic because this post definitely enraged not only me but a lot of people reading it because of how poorly you're being treated.

WTF is that nonsense.  I wouldn't cook another thing for him.", "Right? She\u2019ll probably have a lot of kids with him and still complain about this years on. So annoying.

If someone gave me the same offer to play Moonlight Sonata on the piano, I would fail. It's just not even humanly possible for me, as someone who doesn't know how to play piano, to learn how to play a song of that length and complexity within 24 hours.\n\nThis guy is intellectually and physically capable of washing a dish.

But u should sit down and have a talk with him about the chores and split them, also practice makes perfect nobody is great the first time.
