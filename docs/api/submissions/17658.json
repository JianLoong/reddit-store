Together we have a daughter (3F) and are currently expecting our second child together. We both also have a child from previous relationships: I have Liam (8M) from my previous marriage, and my husband has Ava (10F).\r  \n\r  \nI make Sunday lunch for my family every week. On Friday, Liam asked if I could make stuffing without onions this week. Liam doesn't normally eat stuffing. He tried it a few times, decided he wasn't a fan, and that was it. He tried it with his dad the weekend before (we have 50/50 custody, so our weekends vary) and liked it. I agreed, and on Sunday made my son his own stuffing without onions. It's no big deal, after all, and I'm happy to make separate portions of anything if it means my children eat more.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where the problem starts. We sit at the dining table and John points out that Liam has stuffing on his plate. Liam tells him that I made him stuffing without onions, because he likes it without the onions. Immediately, I noticed Ava's mood sour, and when I pressed her, she asked why I didn't make her stuffing without onions when she'd asked about it months ago. Now, I'd understand where she was coming from if she'd actually asked but I had no clue what she was talking about. I said as much, and she told me that she'd brought it up with John, who said he'd talk to me. John never spoke to me about it, and told Ava that it was 'too much work' for me to take out the onions just for her.\r  \n\r  \nJohn said he didn't tell me because he thought it'd be too hard on me, wanted to make things easier, thought I'd only say no anyway. He even said that it didn't make sense to make a separate portion for just one person. He said it was stupid that I'd even done it for Liam. He said the kids should learn to either make do with onions or not have stuffing at all, because not everything in life is going to go their way. I called him an idiot. I then went to the kitchen and got the rest of the onion-less stuffing for Ava to try.\r  \n\r  \nLater that evening, Ava went back to her mother's and told her what happened, which caused an argument between her and John (and they're not on good terms anyway). John has been angry with me since. He says it's my fault Ava (and her mother) is mad at him. He says I should've just left the 'd\\*mn stuffing' alone, that I'm just spoiling my son by giving into him like that. There's been some name-calling, but I'd rather not repeat what he said.\r  \n\r  \nLiam must have told Mike what happened, too, because he's told me that he thinks John is overreacting. John's mother and older sister think I'm an a-hole, but his brother has told me to just ignore him. My parents are also on my side, because they used to make separate portions for me when I was a child if I didn't like a specific ingredient. My sister told me to post on here to see if the majority think I'm in the wrong or not. So, I dread to ask, am I the a-hole for making a separate portion of stuffing to suit my son's taste?", "created_utc": 1684509272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lyeb9/aita_for_making_a_separate_portion_of_stuffing/", "score": 2185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's cruel.\n\nYour child is 8 not 18. If it wasn't too much trouble to make him something he would prefer to eat why wouldn't you do that for him?? \n\nSounds like your family doesn't like onions, maybe no more onions? \ud83d\ude06\n\nFor real though- John's reaction to you _feeding YOUR child_ is horrendous. If it were me I'd be concerned about what nonsense he's saying to your children when you're not around.", "NTA. Your husband is just mad he got caught lying to his daughter about talking to you... which probably has more to do with HIM not wanting to deal with it, than not wanting you to have extra work.\n\nNormally I wouldn't assign an extra assumption of poor behavior, but I feel like a guilty conscience is often the cause of an overreaction like this. He knows he's being a shitty communicator.", "Uh NTA, next time, make him stuffing with shit he hates in it and make him eat it to see how it feels. Good on ya for accommodating your son. And now you know your daughter also doesn\u2019t want onions. John needs better communication skills specially if y\u2019all have kids.", "NTA. But, onions in the stuffing are the least of your problems. If you SO is calling you names and telling you how to treat your son -you have bigger issues to address.", "NTA. Your husband is though. For first telling his daughter he'd do something and intentionally not do it. He caused this entire thing. He should have talked about it with you before deciding to tell her that you said it would be too much work. It's his lies that caused this mess.", "Nta watch as an adult blames others for their own poor behavior and unwillingness to accommodate.", "NTA, sounds like you would have done the same for Ava (or anyone else) if she had asked you directly. Your husband was trying to look after you, but his final reaction makes him TA.", "OP is NTA and a caring parent.  Now John on the other hand...\n\nI know this is story is just a snapshot of your life, but OP ask yourself if this behaviot of name calling and shaming is a one-off event or a pattern.  If it's the latter, do yourself and Liam a favor and sincerely reevaluate this relationship.", "NTA - some things are a lot of work to make without certain ingredients. Other things are easier to accommodate. He should have talked to you about it, or even suggested the whole thing do without to see if you both liked it that way.\n\nThe way he talked to both you and his daughter though is concerning. Gives some insight onto why him and his ex may not be on good terms.", "NTA. John\u2019a reaction is pretty telling though. His need to control what is served and the flow of information, and to denigrate you personally as well as your child rearing skills is alarming to say the least. But perhaps he is right and it is too much trouble.  Since half of the diners at the table don\u2019t like onions you should only make stuffing without onions from now on.", "NTA. From now on just make all the stuffing without onions to make it \"easier on you\" and then when he complains about not having onions tell him not everything in life is going to go his way.", "NTA. Your husband lied, and it came back to bite him in the ass. It sounds like you\u2019d have gladly made Ava her own portion if you\u2019d known. You aren\u2019t the asshole, and you should let your husband know that since you\u2019re the one cooking, he doesn\u2019t get to dictate what substitutions or requests you\u2019re willing to accommodate.", "NTA - John shouldn\u2019t have spoken for you, end of story. If he felt that strongly about not making special food accommodations for children he should have told you about Ava\u2019s request and that he didn\u2019t agree with it. And then you could have discussed wether or not to do it together. But as another commenter said, you just don\u2019t add onions to half the batch and it\u2019s makes one more pot to clean. This isn\u2019t some crazy request. \n\nAnd that \u201cnot everything in life will go your way\u201d statement is crazy over onions.", "NTA - how were you supposed to know your husband told a white lie to ava about the stuffing? he should've owned up to the problem he created and been honest with her, and you, about it when you were at the table.   \n  \nsmall things like this turning into big arguments is a sign that communication isn't great and that there are likely other issues that are *actually* causing tension. it's wild that the ex wife, your MIL, SIL, and BIL, your sister, and parents are all involved over stuffing that was made without onions.", "NTA for making a portion of food without a particular ingredient, but this isn't about stuffing, is it? Your stepdaughter trusted her father to ask you to do something for her, and he chose not to bother, and now he's blaming you for making him look bad because you were happy to do it. There also seems to be a lot of name-calling going both ways. Did you call him an \"idiot\" in front of the children? That's not good. You two might want to try counseling or something.", "NTA, but if you don\u2019t draw some sharp lines about this, you might become TA.\n\nYour husband\u2019s behaviour is unacceptable, and you need to be very clear with him about what is going to stop.\n\n1. He is going to stop calling you names. You will not tolerate verbal abuse from him towards you or anyone else in your home. I note you called him an idiot - that wasn\u2019t acceptable either, but I can see how it was a response to him saying you doing something was \u201cstupid\u201d. You should apologise for that; you should insist on an apology from him and a commitment to not using insults in disagreements.\n\n2. He is not to lie about what you have or haven\u2019t said, and he is not to make decisions without you and then hold you responsible for them, or lie to others that you made them. This isn\u2019t negotiatiable. You are not his scapegoat for his decisions. He needs to apologise for blaming you for a decision he made in the first place, and for blaming you for not reading his mind and daring to have your own opinion which didn\u2019t match the one he didn\u2019t communicate.\n\n3. He is not to dictate to you about or insult you over what you do and don\u2019t do for the kids. If you\u2019re cooking, it\u2019s your decision what you are and aren\u2019t willing to cook.\n\n4. He is not to turn his pointless and arbitrary decisions into rules for the kids without consultation with you, unless he understands that you aren\u2019t going to follow them. You are never going to agree to make things be something they dislike for no better reason than \u201csometimes things aren\u2019t what you like\u201d - that\u2019s bizarre reasoning. Kids learn about compromise over things they actually need to compromise about. What they learn from unilateral decisions to do things the way they don\u2019t like purely because they don\u2019t like it is \u201cwow, dad is a petty, bullying AH who is doubling down and making me miserable because he\u2019s embarrassed about his past behaviour\u201d.\n\n5. You and him are going to marriage counselling because there\u2019s no way this is the only topic on which he becomes verbally abusive and aggressive or doubles down on things to make others miserable to punish them for pointing out his unreasonable behaviour.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t accept those terms, take several looks at how his behaviour impacts you and the kids and decide what you need to change to minimise it.", "LOL defin NTA, and I'm glad you immediately did that for Ava as well. A good step mother wow that's rare.", "NTA. How could you be? You didnt do something you had no idea you were expected to do.\n\nAnd your position is totally reasonable. It is not much work to make stuffing and only put the onions in a portion of it.\n\nJohn is being ridiculous. A life lesson based on stuffing? Gfto lol", "NTA - Kids don't *LIKE* onions.  It's not that big of a deal if you're willing to do the extra work so the kids will actually *EAT* it.", "WTF?  Next week family meals, use every ingredient John hates but with which the rest of you have no problem.  I would be most interested in the resulting reaction from the asshole.\n\nAs for teaching \"not everything in life is going to go their way\", this precious object lesson is better taught using the example of some people are dealt a bad hand of a parent who is an opiniated jerk, rather than food, for fuck's sake.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is not only an AH, he's ridiculous.\n\n>He said the kids should learn to either make do with onions or not have stuffing at all, because not everything in life is going to go their way.\n\nSo. . . because not EVERYTHING is going to work out in their favour, he thinks that they should be taught to assume that NOTHING will work out in their favour? They should just never make the effort to ask for what they want or try to negotiate for things from the outset and just . . . give up without even trying?\n\nI'm going to go ahead and assume that John is not a very accomplished or successful person. And I don't say that maliciously. But his entire mindset seems to be one of, \"Why even bother trying?\" And that's the opposite of how successful people manage to break new ground or accomplish things.\n\nHis \"not everything is going to go their way, so they should learn now to live with only what they're given\" is teaching them to give up on things before they even start, and to assume that they can only have what others think or choose to give them, and that they aren't allowed to ask for things in life. He's teaching them a thoroughly defeatist, self-fulfilling prophecy of, \"Not everything is going to work out for me, so I might as well not even try.\" But the only way to ever get what you want in life is to ask. Yes, sometimes people will say no, or it won't be possible to meet your requests. But other times people will say YES. \n\nYou are NTA, but more importantly, you need to look really hard at the kind of man you're married to, and what he's teaching your children. He isn't setting them up for success, or to advocate for themselves in any context. He is teaching them that they don't deserve to ask for things, only to take what they are given, good or bad. That's a really terrible life lesson.", "NTA of course. Sorry yr husband is such a jerk. There would've been minimal fuss if he'd simply told you about Ava's request in the first place. So he can't be a crybaby about it now.\n\nHis argument is also nonsensical. You shouldn't have made the sep stuffing because you have to teach kids \"not everything in life goes their way\"? That's so ridiculous. You can certainly make them separate dishes and convey the idea that no, not everything is going to go their way. But in the case of food, you can do it differently, so why not?\n\nAnd his calling you names you can't repeat here is hateful. Again, sorry you're married to such a jerk.\n\nJohn, YOU need to apologize to your wife and your daughter, and admit that the crux of this issue comes down to your dismissing your daughter's request and not passing it on. Tell the rest of the family you're sorry too, and admit you overreacted.\n\nHaving read the rest of the comments now, please show them to your husband!", "NTA at all\n\nYou're not spoiling them, you're teaching them food/cooking is a wide-varied experience and that they should try multiple versions of things before saying they don't like them.\n\nIf he's still so pissy about it, get the kids to help make the onion-less stuffing. That way (for his eyes) they'd be learning to fend for themselves if they don't like something, and you get extra bonding time, which those kids will remember forever\n\n\"You make stuffing?\"\n\n\"Yeah, no onions though. Dad was kind of an ass and always tried to make me eat the damn onions. At least my stepmom knew how to cook more than one recipe and taught me this one\"", "NTA your husband should habe talked to you and give you the option to decide.", "NTA, you aren't a mind reader and couldn't have known your husband was going to just lie to his kid.  It's his fault that his ex is pissed about the whole thing.    \n\n\nIf you want to make stuffing without onions, that's your choice.  If your husband cares that much about \"giving in\" to the kids about food, it sounds like he just volunteered to do all the cooking to me.", "NTA. John literally created this problem by not only lying his daughter by telling her he would talk to you when he didn\u2019t and being a control freak just because she doesn\u2019t like a specific food and now he\u2019s blaming you for the consequences.", "So I\u2019m not a huge fan of short order cooking for people in my house, but NTA it wasn\u2019t like you were making a bunch of different crap for people you just left out onions. I make chicken and just leave off the sauce if someone doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not like you has to make a whole different meal for them.", "NTA\n\n Seeing as he isn't the one who cooks, i fail to see how making separate stuffings affects him. He not only ignored his daughter, he also caused a scandal and made the kids feel bad.", "NTA. I hated onions as a kid and my parents would portion out things without it. This isn\u2019t a crazy ask. And you were willing to do it.\n\nJohn just decided without telling you that Ava didn\u2019t need onion less stuffing. And ok no big deal, but he\u2019s an asshole for getting mad that you did it for your son. Y\u2019all had never discussed it and he decided to turn it into a fight instead of saying \u201cSorry Ava I thought it would be too much extra work so I didn\u2019t want to ask. I was wrong.\u201d\n\nJohn doubling down on the issue and saying you are spoiling your own son is very inappropriate. It\u2019s also highly inappropriate to argue with you about this IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.\n\nIf he wanted to discuss why he disagreed and for you to work out what you wanted to do re- onion less food or modified recipes, then he should have discussed that with you privately. Maybe you\u2019d agree with him if he expressed himself like an adult instead of getting into an argument and name calling you in front of the kids.\n\nHis utter failure to communicate appropriately makes him the asshole. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the issue was.\n\nYou are also not a mind reader. I\u2019m sorry but this is a big red flag. Y\u2019all should consider counseling to work on your communication and co-parenting.", "This is a wild thing to have a blown up argument about. It's not like a whole separate meal was being made for only one person. It's just making something and taking out a portion before adding an ingredient. Your son may have been enjoying the stuffing months before, if your husband had only informed you of the daughter's request when it happened. Instead he seems to have made the daughter feel left out of the family by not letting her be heard. Hopefully, in the future, she will come to you directly with any requests she has for you. You are NTA.", "NTA, your husband sounds like he has control issues. Does he often expect you to read his mind and get mad when you do something else, or deny the kids harmless \"luxuries\" just because he thinks they'll become spoiled?", "If you don't mind doing it, end of story. NTA", "Your husband is an arse.\n\nNTA, you want kids to eat so you make them what they want to eat.

My family\u2019s always had two dressings - one with oysters and one without. My husband\u2019s family always had two - one with celery and one without.  Of course your MIL supports John \u2014 she\u2019s probably the one who indoctrinated him that kids don\u2019t deserve any extra effort, aren\u2019t worth the bother, even if the cook doesn\u2019t see it as an inconvenience. It\u2019s sad your husband has that mindset even though he\u2019s an AH.", "NTA. I absolutely LOATHE onions and it pisses me off that so many dishes just automatically add them.  I don't think I am allergic, but they really mess up my stomach.\n\nYou're a good mom.", "I wonder if your husband would have thought the same if it was your three year old who had said they wanted onionless stuffing months ago\u2026 NTA especially if nobody had explained Ava wanted stuffing without onions. \n\nAva had the onionless stuffing once she explained she wanted it, I don\u2019t get the big deal and why\u2019s your husband reacting like this over something so small? Also if you\u2019re making stuffing anyway it\u2019s easy to put some aside to leave the onions out of it, hardly hard work. He sounds lovely.", "NTA \n\nSome people avoid some ingredients.

One day I hope spice level at kids will match ours.", "NTA\n\nI can't believe how this blew up over a little stuffing! John lied to Ava, in the process setting you up to look like an ass by making Ava think you went to the effort for Liam after refusing to make the same adjustment for her....and now he's blaming you because there's a really amazing amount of fallout from his unilaterally deciding that you shouldn't.....make food the kids will like?\nJohn is the only one here who messed up. \n\nI am guessing he doesn't cook much or he'd have known that with some foods it's very easy to make a couple of variations .\n\nI regularly make Thai & Indian inspired soups.  I like them medium spicy.  I regularly set aside portions before I add the pepper flakes & chili oil because some of the full grown adults I feed prefer less heat. With a lot of foods, it's not a big hassle to make accommodations for different palates and,  especially with kids, making those small changes goes a long way towards making them willing to try different foods.", "NTA - I don't even know where to begin. This isn't about the stuffing. This is about adults communicating properly. \n\nI'm sorry the kids are feeling the fallout of John's juvenile behavior. Please make sure to talk to them, because they probably think his shitty mood is their fault for disliking onions.", "NTA \n\nIf you are the one cooking and have no problem doing it then there should be no problem. \n\nNot giving a kid who doesn\u2019t like onions will not freakin spoil them either.", "Nta.

Children should get the required nutrients and if they are agreeing to consume the rest of it without one ingredient, isn't that better than not eating at all?? \n\nTo rectify this whole situation, I think you should talk to your daughter first. Make her understand your part of the story. Might as well make a special meal for her to make her happy. After that, talk to her biological mother about this and get it resolved.

We both also have a child from previous relationships: I have Liam (8M) from my previous marriage, and my husband has Ava (10F).\r  \n\r  \nI make Sunday lunch for my family every week. On Friday, Liam asked if I could make stuffing without onions this week. Liam doesn't normally eat stuffing. He tried it a few times, decided he wasn't a fan, and that was it. He tried it with his dad the weekend before (we have 50/50 custody, so our weekends vary) and liked it. I agreed, and on Sunday made my son his own stuffing without onions. It's no big deal, after all, and I'm happy to make separate portions of anything if it means my children eat more.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where the problem starts. We sit at the dining table and John points out that Liam has stuffing on his plate. Liam tells him that I made him stuffing without onions, because he likes it without the onions. Immediately, I noticed Ava's mood sour, and when I pressed her, she asked why I didn't make her stuffing without onions when she'd asked about it months ago. Now, I'd understand where she was coming from if she'd actually asked but I had no clue what she was talking about.

He even said that it didn't make sense to make a separate portion for just one person. He said it was stupid that I'd even done it for Liam. He said the kids should learn to either make do with onions or not have stuffing at all, because not everything in life is going to go their way. I called him an idiot. I then went to the kitchen and got the rest of the onion-less stuffing for Ava to try.\r  \n\r  \nLater that evening, Ava went back to her mother's and told her what happened, which caused an argument between her and John (and they're not on good terms anyway). John has been angry with me since. He says it's my fault Ava (and her mother) is mad at him. He says I should've just left the 'd\\*mn stuffing' alone, that I'm just spoiling my son by giving into him like that. There's been some name-calling, but I'd rather not repeat what he said.\r  \n\r  \nLiam must have told Mike what happened, too, because he's told me that he thinks John is overreacting. John's mother and older sister think I'm an a-hole, but his brother has told me to just ignore him. My parents are also on my side, because they used to make separate portions for me when I was a child if I didn't like a specific ingredient. My sister told me to post on here to see if the majority think I'm in the wrong or not. So, I dread to ask, am I the a-hole for making a separate portion of stuffing to suit my son's taste?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So what does he do? He asks the parent who cooks if it would be ok to accomodate, I will assume he asked politely and even explained why. This is good problem solving and communication on his part, and Liam trusted you to handle his request with reason (which you did).\n\nYour husband could learn something from Liam when it comes to communication.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband, John, is a major one.

He should instead be saying thank you, that is so thoughtful, and I messed up and should have said that Ava would love the same.

I would reiterate with Ava that you did not know she asked for food without onions, and ask her if there's anything else she would prefer with food.
