XD", "Yes, YTA. I also don\u2019t see an issue with the lightbulb or using a drill. But boxing is something else. That\u2019s not something you teach without consent. The fact that he did that behind the child\u2019s mothers back makes me agree with her that he\u2019s not a good role model or a good grandparent. And now you and your dad are teaching your child to be dishonest with his mother. This is bad parenting and harmful. It could also be dangerous because it teaches your child it is ok to keep a secret from his parents which might put him in danger for (sexual) abuse.", "YTA. Your wife is allowed to be concerned about what your father is teaching your son. \n\nI don't agree with her banning all contact but going behind her back is an AH move.", "Haha, you saved yourself from any judgement from me with that edit.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH, though with that edit it seems judgement might no longer be neccessary \ud83d\ude02", "YTA.\n\nYou're telling your kid it's okay to lie to his mother. That's shitty parenting.\n\nI get the feeling that it's not about your kid learning some skills but about your kid being taught toxic masculinity. Has your father ever try to teach the kid to cook ? To saw ? To do laundry ?", "YTA. Not for what is being taught to your child, but the fact is you\u2019re lying to the mother of your child and teaching him to be deceitful while you\u2019re at it. You may not be directly telling him to lie, but he knows he\u2019s doing something his mom doesn\u2019t want him to do and feels like he needs to hide it.", "YTA - For lying. You should be allowed to let your son see his grandfather. You're wife may not like it, but she can't unilaterally deny visitation with family. I don't see anything that your father is doing that is that bad. You're wife sounds over protective. But don't lie and hide what you're doing.", "YTA\n\nMainly because you\u2019re teaching your son to sneak around behind his mother\u2019s back.\n\nActually talk to your wife and come to an agreement on what is appropriate to teach your son.", "That second edit is gold haha.\n\nI am going with you were in fact the asshole, you shouldn't lie to your wife and you certainly shouldn't teach your son that it is ok to lie.\n\nHowever, telling your wife puts you back into not the asshole.\n\nYour wife just laughing it off and covertly packing enough lunch for all of you is just pure genius and you have a pretty awesome wife. Sounds like it just took her a minute to process some new information before looking at it objectively rather emotionally.\n\nGoing forwards, be honest with each other; If this has taught you anything it should be that you can trust each other with different opinions.", "These comments\u2026yikes", "YTA for making your kid lie to his mother.\n\nIf a kid is taught that it is okay to lie to a parent, what's to stop another adult from convincing him to lie to both of you about what they are doing together in a much more sinister space? Don't go down this road mate.\n\nIt would be wiser to have a conversation with your wife about what stuff she *would* be okay with your son learning. I learnt how to change a washer in a tap and fix a blocked kitchen drain from my dad (who taught his kids how to do stuff around the house so he could get us to do it while he played golf LOL) and I'm glad I learnt that. Are there ways your dad could pass on skills that are useful for life that your wife would be happy with?\n\nBut don't get your kid to lie to his mum. That's plain wrong!", "YTA.  First, by teaching your child to lie to his mother, even by omission by hiding from her that he saw your father.\n\nSecond, for completely disregarding and overriding her legitimate parenting concerns.  Boxing is a great way to cause TBI, and frankly I prefer my kids without self-inflicted loss of cognitive function.\n\nFinally, for apparently not understanding how periods work in paragraphs. Perhaps see #2.", "ESH- You for lying but your wife for forbidding him to see your dad. From what you\u2019ve said, I don\u2019t think he did anything wrong. He\u2019s teaching him life skills. I understand why she might not think boxing is a good one but it would come in handy if he ever needed to defend himself from someone.\n\nETA- Maybe you should get your wife to learn the basics too. She might end up enjoying it. lol", "YTA for the lying but I did get a giggle at the update when your wife proved she knew you well enough to know it wouldn't stick. I'm glad you have a relationship where you not only own up to your mistakes (lying), but can find forgiveness in each other too.", "YTA I love the three sandwiches part. You shouldn\u2019t lie to your spouse and you should never ever have your kids keep secret from their parents (other than gifts/surprise parties). I think you leaned your lesson here.", "NTA im not sure why responses here are generally absolutely insane. These are completely age appropriate life skills and your wife, when realizing she was wrong, hid it from you because she thought it was funny to make you sneak around to keep your child involved with a family member he likes. I would warn you away from boxing however, it's come out that repeated head injuries are approximately one of the worst things you can set you kid up for especiallywhen young. Maybe try a fighting style with less hits to the head involved.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s your father so I feel as though you should have the saying on when he gets to see your son. As long as your dad isn\u2019t being a bad influence on him I don\u2019t see why he shouldn\u2019t get to see your son.", "ESH \n\nYou- ya you should of not lied to her \n\nHer- forbidding y\u2019all\u2019s kid to not see your father", "YTA\n\nBased on the comments, your wife is awesome \ud83d\ude01", "Yta - tell your wife have a conversation about what you both can agree is appropriate and there will probably need to be some compromise on both sides\n\nI don\u2019t understand why your dad teaching your son skills offends your wife to the point she doesn\u2019t want him around your son", "NTA.\n\nI'm not seeing why your wife is freaking out. You don't leave your son alone with your father, so he's still supervised and boxing is an excellent sport to learn. On top of this you actively tell your son not to lie to his Mum and told your wife on your own.", "I was with you until you said that you were teaching your son a violent sport that often causes severe enough head trauma to cause nasty things like trauma-induced early dementia.  That is something she should have a right to say no to, as a parent, because it has such obvious dangers.  Everything else sounded like enjoyable, useful, safe pursuits.  But high-risk activities for your kids should be 2 yes/1 no, and there\u2019s quite enough research out there on the dangers of repeated head trauma for a reasonable person to say no to boxing. YTA for that.  Sit down and talk to your wife, and come to an agreement about what activities are no-go, and I suspect that she\u2019ll be willing to relax her stance.", "NTA. This was all stuff I knew how to do when I was 6. As long as your dad isn\u2019t an ass directly to your child, your wife is coming off as overprotective.", "YTA \"don't tell other parent\" is an awful thing to do to a child", "YTA - your wife can't trust your dad, and now you. In top of that, you're teaching your kid to lie when it's convenient (you really think it won't backfire at some point?).\n\nStart being honest and a good role model, who knows you may like it in the long run.", "This is going to backfire so spectacularly you are going to end up in divorce court. \n\nYour wife has some serious, legitimate concerns about your father\u2019s relationship with your son. For your wife- teaching your kid how to fight crossed a serious line. And your response to this is to see him secretly and teach your kid to lie to his mother. - So yeah, YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay for *EITHER* of you to unilaterally make a decision on this relationship. You should be having a discussion on why boxing is off limits and what her concerns are (safety, perhaps- or maybe it is that he might use these skills at school inappropriately). \n\nStop discounting her concerns and stop lying to your wife. You are proving to her that she can\u2019t trust you when you disagree with her.", "It's unfortunate that one of the life skills you never picked up was how to use punctuation.\n\nYTA for going against your wife's wishes.", "I think ESH, I saw you commented and talked it through and all is well now. \n\nher for initially just closing the door on the conversation and just declaring her wants, you for lying to your wife and teaching that to your son.", "YTA, but only for the lying, not for taking your son to spend time with grandpa.\n\nAll of the things you said he\u2019s learning sound super normal and appropriate for an 8 year old. My buddy\u2019s kid just got their first 4-wheeler at 4yo, which was a hand me down from another guy who bought it for his son when his kid was 3 1/2. I was in the shop with my dad using tools before kindergarten too.", "ESH Its bad to lie to your wife but its worst to restrict the child from seeing their grandparent.", "NTA, your dad doesn\u2019t appear to be teaching him anything bad and you\u2019re there too. It\u2019s not right to give ultimatums. Sure, I\u2019ll say you shouldn\u2019t lie to your wife but it\u2019s a two way deal. Giving ultimatums rarely works out. Plus you have hashed everything out so it\u2019s good. I do think it\u2019s funny that everyone is freaking out over your son boxing. Boxing is no different than pretty much every other martial art. They all do sparring with gear on though most people do it just to get in shape. Plus, historically people worked from the time they could walk. As long as there\u2019s trusted supervision I don\u2019t see a problem with saws.", "A Dad here. Don't listen to these consensus cretins. You're a great Dad. Keep doing what you're doing. Your boy will thank you for it one day.\n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nDespite your good intentions, you're disrespecting a boundary she has set. He is your son, but also HER son. You need to talk with her about this more and come to a sort of compromise. I'm not too sure of the reasons his grandad is a bad role model, but your wife must have good reason to have placed that boundary.", "I'm sorry you think letting your 8 your old handle a SAW is okay??? Yeah, absolutely no wonder why your wife is concerned about influences in her son's life! YTA 100000%", "YTA- It is not fair to go behind your wife's back, nor is it fair/okay for you to encourage your son to lie to his mother. \nHowever, this definitely feels like it is a lot more complicated, and from what you have said, I do not think that banning the relationship altogether is fair either. If your son genuinely wants a relationship with his grandfather, maybe consider having an open conversation with your wife about creating 'safe' boundaries?", "YTA - it's a soft yta simply because while I don't agree with your wife's decision I still don't feel its right to just go behind her back like this. If it's worth fighting for then confront her directly instead of being sneaky.", "YTA for teaching an 8 year old boxing. Why don\u2019t you love his head?", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "You are absolutely the asshole for teaching your child to lie to his mother. Teaching him it's okay for other grownups to ask him to keep secrets from her - or you - makes him an *ideal* target for sexual abuse. Bravo. YTA.\n\nAdditionally, boxing is an absurdly dangerous sport with a high risk of acute TBI or chronic, cumulative brain damage, and she is well within her rights not to want her small child involved in it.\n\nShe isn't blameless either - she needs to talk to you about her *specific* concerns and see if you can all work together to facilitate a safe, sensible relationship with your dad.\n\nBut after the stunt you've pulled, I would not blame her and she would not be TA if that was off the table permanently.", "What  a way to fuxk your marriage up  congratulations rather than been honest your teaching your son to lie and be deceitful  how can you not be an ah.

To him, he'll think that his mum knows he's struggling but therefore thinks she's choosing not to help him or something, whereas actually she just has no idea he's struggling at all. No one is omniscient, and it's not healthy/normal for kids to believe that of their parents either. Sure, tell him that some things are obvious to parents when the kid thinks they're hiding it, but telling your kid that his mum knows everything just sets him up for potentially bad situations (such as him then not telling her something crucial because he thinks she must already know) \n\n\nI read that you're teaching him to be open and tell his mum/parents everything. Focus on teaching him that, instead of making his mum some all knowing god figure. Teach him to come to you as well. Sure, you may not be able to fix his problem immediately but you and your wife are a team. Don't dump 100% of that parenting responsibly on her. If he comes to you with a problem that you can't fix, then consult your wife and figure it out together. Your are a parent too, no one can fix their kids problems immediately anyway, your wife won't be able to solve things 100% right away either, and setting your kid up to believe that isn't great either. It's perfectly okay to tell your kid 'I don't have the answer/solution to your problem right away, but we're going to figure this out together, okay?'. Going through the problem solving process together with your son is gonna teach him some incredibly useful life skills instead of just relying on your wife for 100% of problem solving needs.

You have your own skills, and it's perfectly fine that you're not intellectual. What you're teaching your son, is that you're less than his mum because she's 'the smart one' . What if your son grows up to be more good with his hands, than his brain? He'll end up with the same view you have of yourself, where he'll put himself down for not being as 'smart' as other people instead of valuing his gifts. (I don't know for sure that you do feel this way about yourself, I'm just basing it off the vibes your comments give off, when you talk about yourself /your intelligence vs his mum). \n\nYou can solve problems for your kid too, you can help in certain ways and his mum can help him in others. Don't be afraid to teach him that he can come to you to solve certain problems for him, there will be some that you can help with where your wife can't. Don't frame it like his mum is the only capable parent, and you're useless. Because you're not useless at all!!
