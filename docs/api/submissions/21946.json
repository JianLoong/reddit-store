You also need to realize that it is hard for a child to hate a parent that brought their problems on them, especially if it is their only parent since her father seems to be absent or minimally available.  That means she has to hate the only family she has, her mom.  I've seen kids accept a lot worse because they are in that situation.  It is incredibly sad.  I do agree that the non affair kids get to make their own choice about involvement, but they are also blaming a kid, her, for something she is not responsible for, the affair.  They should be focused on hating their dad and her mom, but then again, kids deflect blame to make it easier to accept their parent.", "Wow, you are so grown up for a 17 year old.

And man, mustn't it hurt like hell to have a dad abandon you like that? Yes it was a harsh truth, but that is a very hard thing to hear from a friend you want support from, and it's probably something she knows deep down and is reminded of constantly from lots of people.

She is a direct result of her mom's mistake, if her mom is a bad person for having an affair then she is tied to that mistake, almost like her existence is a mistake. It's understandable why she is defensive about her mom.

Telling her she needs to accept it could easily come feel like you're saying \"you know what you are, you're a mistake that caused them pain and should feel bad about it\" Even though it's obviously not your intention. \n\nYou and your friend are really young in the grand scheme of things and this is an understandably hard thing to live with at that age. To know your mom did something so horrible and you are a constant walking reminder of that that you have to live with everyday.\n\nI think you could apologize and tell her you probably should just stay out of this. If you don't want to listen to her complain, which is understandable, you can tell her you're not the person to come to with this as you really aren't equipped for this sort of thing and redirect the conversation.
