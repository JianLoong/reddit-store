Have a little tact and respect. Part of being a friend is allowing your friends to discuss the same situation multiple times, it\u2019s called processing.

That means she has to hate the only family she has, her mom.  I've seen kids accept a lot worse because they are in that situation.  It is incredibly sad.  I do agree that the non affair kids get to make their own choice about involvement, but they are also blaming a kid, her, for something she is not responsible for, the affair.

It was too harsh, and there was a better way to give your friend your honest opinion.", "YTA. You went too far on several points. How many details do you actually know about the affair? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve heard it all from your friend\u2019s perspective, and as children, neither of you are hearing the full stories from adults. You don\u2019t know anything about the details of what happened that really lead to your friend\u2019s birth, and you passed A LOT of judgment on her mother without having been around 17 years ago to know what went down. What\u2019s the age gap between her parents? Where did they meet? Was there a power dynamic? We don\u2019t know. \nYou manage to also somehow blame the mother while calling the father a deadbeat. I\u2019m noticing some internalized misogyny here. \n\nSecond, imagine being your friend. A product of an affair, ignored by her siblings, and then her closest friend turns to her and tells her that her siblings have the right not to interact with her because of what her mom did. While I agree that obviously they are of no obligation to give your friend money, I\u2019m guessing her statement was more of a lament about the situation where your friends siblings have a lot of money due to support of their father, and she and her mother have little. Because it\u2019s not fair what has happened to her. It\u2019s not fair that she has lost the chance of having siblings because of the choices of a parent. While you\u2019re right that she shouldn\u2019t be blaming her siblings, she is literally a child herself, and I do think it\u2019s way too harsh to tell an affair child that it\u2019s totally fair that her siblings don\u2019t want anything to do with her. I think you saying that you wouldn\u2019t want to interact with a child who involved hurting your mother is your own bias. You\u2019re friend didn\u2019t do anything to deserve being treated like a pariah, and I wouldn\u2019t punish MY sibling if my parents had done something terrible. They don\u2019t owe her anything, but your friend shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for her parents. Her siblings icing her out sends the message that she is the problem, and that\u2019s shitty of them. They should be cutting off THEIR dad, not directing it towards their blameless sibling.\n\nLastly, as her friend, there are 1000 ways to have this conversation that weren\u2019t as harsh or as cruel as you did it. I know you\u2019re 17, but please learn from this. Her family situation is shitty enough. She needs a friend who supports her, not one who jumps down her throat as she works through extremely complex thoughts and feelings about a very complicated family situation.  Try ASKING questions that get her to see things, not telling her how she should feel. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s really your siblings that you are angry at, or the fact that they got more support/attention/financial help from your dad?\u201d", "YTA. Learn some empathy.", "YTA - what you said was accurate, but you said it like an asshole\n\nNext time, empathize with your friend. You understand her frustration of not being acknowledged by people she views as family members. You're sorry that her parents' decisions have put her in that position. Then stop there.", "This is a moral sub, so gotta say YTA \n\n\u201cHonest without kindness is still cruelty.\u201d (Or something like that.)\n\nI was expecting it to be \u2018direct your anger towards your parents\u2019 AND elaborate on her biodad is the deadbeat and sure it\u2019s honest to add her mom could\u2019ve foreseen he is and accepted it. She still chose to have her and love her, must be worth a lot. And forget what happens between parents and messy relations - not feel entitled to more cause the other siblings got the better end. It\u2019s not on them, same way it\u2019s not on you.\n\nNext time, do think first. You were not wrong factually, you were absolutely wrong to assume your opinion means Dad is NOT held accountable AND your friend is entitled period - that\u2019s not just harsh but half a story that\u2019s either badly delivered OR you\u2019re judging her and she\u2019s accurate in her thoughts.\n\nWhatever the case her feelings are valid and you went too far by your own logic. If this is about the parents how did your post end and focus to her (as the affair KID) being the problem here?

Sometimes you gotta accept you actually wouldn\u2019t know Jack after a point, and you misspoke or were careless. Your point about it being about the parents stands.
