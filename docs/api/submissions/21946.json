Blaming her half siblings for her parents\u2019 mistakes is wrong and won\u2019t resolve anything. \n\nMaybe you could have said it in a nicer way. But the message is true. \n\nRegardless, she is your friend and you hurt her feelings so it would hurt to apologize for hurting her feelings.", "NTA\n\nSometimes the truth hurts. She's misdirecting her anger at her half sisters, because it's easier then blaming her mother and father.", "NTA - spot on!", "It was probably a rude reality check for Layla but I\u2019m going with NTA.\n\nI get why Layla doesn\u2019t want to direct her anger at her mom\u2026her mom is all she has. But at some point she had to understand that her mother was not completely innocent in the whole scenario. \n\nIt was also her mom\u2019s responsibility to go through the proper channels to make sure that Layla\u2019s father provided financial support for Layla. \n\nYour assessment, while factual, was probably difficult for Layla to hear. She probably wanted to just vent to a sympathetic ear rather than receive a harsh dose of reality.", "NTA, you called her out, her frustration is definitely directed towards the wrong people. The anger should be towards her mum and dad. I can't say i would want something to do with a sibling that was a constant reminder that my dad was unfaithful", "NTA - She needed to hear the truth even if it\u2019s hard for her to accept it right now. She\u2019s building resentment towards the wrong people because she\u2019s jealous.", "NTA very true and honest and she probably needed to hear it but you could've told her it in a way that she would've received it better", "Why doesn't she ask her mother why she is not pursuing child support through the court system?", "YTA I\u2019m sorry but that was incredibly mean and for no reason. She just wanted to vent to her friend. In return she got nothing but judgment from you about something out of her control. I\u2019m all for being honest with friends, but this was unnecessarily mean. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she cuts you off one day. \n\nAlso, after she let you know that you hurt her feelings you go on to shit on her again. Wow, you don\u2019t know how to be a friend at all. Safe to say she probably won\u2019t be talking to you much longer. I hope you never have friends be as judgmental to you as you are her. Sheesh", "YTA, not for telling her that her siblings don't owe her anything, but for attacking her mom's character. She needed a friend to listen to her, not chastise her parents' decisions 17 years ago.", "YTA. Is this the way you treat your friends? She already knew the shit you were telling her. You acknowledge she is innocent herself but has to deal with corruption of blood attitudes from her siblings.", "YTA. \n\nMy good god just let your friend vent about her situation. I agree it\u2019s a bit entitled to think they should be helping finically, but you didn\u2019t need to pop off like that. This is supposed to be your friend, not some random person. Have a little tact and respect. Part of being a friend is allowing your friends to discuss the same situation multiple times, it\u2019s called processing. It\u2019s incredibly helpful to just talk about it, if it annoys you, either get over it or politely tell your friend you can\u2019t handle the conversation anymore. \n\nIf you felt the need to discuss her feeling entitled, you could have been kinder about it. Honesty without tact or care is often cruelty. You just didn\u2019t need to do all that.", "YTA for being so insensitive to your friend. Her situation is not her fault and instead of letting her vent you basically shat all over her parents.\n\n> I just personally believe that children from affairs should respect their siblings if they decide not to have a relationship with them\n\nEveryone should respect when people opt to not have relationships with them, this view of yours isn't unique. She didn't say that they owed her anything, just that she felt that being ostracized from them due to her parents was unfair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At the very least, it\u2019s an incredibly inflammatory way to get your point across. \n\nYou\u2019re right that her siblings don\u2019t owe her a relationship and she should try to respect that, but she\u2019s not wrong to feel hurt that they\u2019ve rejected her for something she didn\u2019t ask for, choose, or participate in.", "That was harsh to hear even on reddit but it's the truth. This is how many siblings of kids born from an affair feel. Your friend just like her siblings are innocents but for them she is a living remainder of their father's betrayal to their mother. The easiest and often best solution for siblings in that situation is to ignore or not become involved with the child of the affair.

Mom's only concern is adequate support for her child. Smells fishy.", "Sometimes things can\u2019t be fixed though. People still need a safe space to discuss it.", "Venting that it's unfair doesn't mean she \"expects\" it. Regardless, OP's response was not how a friend speaks to their friend.

Good friends are able to have tough conversations with each other.
