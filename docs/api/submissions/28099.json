She made the turkey, rolls, and one other side.  My grandparents, parents, myself, and my great-aunt and uncle and their boys were the only ones invited.  Aside from the turkey, rolls, and one side, we provided all the other sides.  My family hosted Christmas.  Same sort of thing.\n\nNo one should have to host all the time and given that you've got health issues, husband needs to understand that there should be a rotation.  You've given him plenty of time to get in touch with everyone and say \"Look, we just can't host this year.  Who can handle Thanksgiving?  Who's got Christmas?  We'll bring some sides.\"  Either that, or you go spend your holidays with your family and he can figure out how to host his.", "NTA\n\nYou have chronic pain issues.  If your husband really wants a large holiday gathering, he can do ALL of the cleaning, decorating, planning, invitations, order catering, buy supplies, reheat food, set out food, do miscellaneous host duties, clean up afterwards.  \n\nYou get to sit on your butt for everything.  All of it.  Because it isn't worth your health to host a family party just because others want one.  Any of those guests you invited last year are welcome to host and you would be happy to bring a dish or two to share.  \n\nBut if no one else wants to do the work, you don't need to sacrifice yourself to meet their expectations.\n\n(After a few years of doing the work to host family members for most every major holiday, I finally had enough and gave up.  A few of my ILs hosted for the next year or two before we stopped gathering for holidays.  It turns out that no one else was up to the workload of hosting for 20+ guests either.

We also host family for the holidays and my SILs parents come to our home to celebrate and we are happy to have them.  It adds literally no extra work to add two people to a larger family party.  Having and being with family is a wonderful thing and a privilege.  \n\nParse out the cooking and have people bring things while you cook the main dish and a couple of additional items.

In fact hosting is also super expensive for us right now since we\u2019re still trying to replenish our savings.\n\nUnfortunately they just won\u2019t host, and since husband\u2019s mom isn\u2019t around, he really misses having his family together. I was trying to appeal to that and honestly do love cooking, but it\u2019s way too much work for me when it\u2019s starting to be a lot of people neither of us are related to. If we only do holidays with my family, as we have in the past, he starts to get bummed out and feels alienated from his. We CAN pop into their homes but won\u2019t be fed during the holidays and they\u2019re usually just sitting around watching movies, so not the same level of holidays I\u2019m used to.\n\nYour family holidays sound great!

Besides, feeding the crowd is super expensive when we're still trying to recoup our savings after buying the house and everything.  Get some catering bids and tell everyone they can come but they need to pay $x.xx per plate.\"\n\nReally and truly, there's no reason you and your spouse should have to take on all the expense/work of hosting.  I can't imagine how disappointing this situation is for your husband, but it really sounds like his family just isn't as invested in the holidays as he is.\n\nHolidays were pretty incredible when I was a kid.  Dad's side of the family was in MN, Mom's here in TX.  Gram from MN sent huge Christmas boxes of homemade cookies fudge, etc.  Each of us had a cookie specially decorated for us.  One year, she sent me a beautiful sweater.  She was so excited.  She took the cheerleader down the road shopping to pick out my gift and she was worried I wouldn't like it but the cheerleader said it was perfect.  I was about 12 that year.  I'm 52 now and I still have that sweater tucked safely away.  I suspect your husband misses the things his mom did to make the holidays special.  Maybe ask him about that and see what you can incorporate into your own, small holiday.", "Also let him know you are not feeling up to it. If he wants to host in his own it involves inviting, rsvp, cleaning, shopping, cooking, serving, entertaining and conversing, bar set up and break down, dishes and cleaning again after everyone leaves. You will attend as a guest. I let hubby handle it like I did. He was exhausted and crabby after. He\u2019s never pushed to do it when I\u2019m not involved.  And yes I did it several times on my own, kind of the reason I quit", "Personally, I\u2019d tell your husband that if it\u2019s that important then HE needs to do it. All of it. If it\u2019s no big deal he can solve the food and do all the prep because you are not well enough. \n\nIf it\u2019s too much for him to do then probably it\u2019s a bigger deal then he\u2019s implying it is and it can wait till next year. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m stuck on the idea that you spent in the 100,000s so you could host 2-3 holiday meals a year. And if holidays matter that much it\u2019s probably also worth him learning to cook. \n\nNTA.", "Seconding this. If he wants to host events in his lively home, let him do all the work involved. \n\nOne go of cooking dinner for twenty should be very informative."]}
