Got better for a bit but would return to normal, ranging from the morning of to 10 minutes notice. We would remind her that she needs to ask and not make an assumption (if asked, we\u2019d likely say yes but make timelines).\n\nShe sold her RV and in mid September bought a non winterized cabin home with no running water in the mountains about an hour out of town (Colorado)\n\nImmediately after buying the cabin, she went on a 5 week cruise from US to AUS and had a bad experience (covid, lack of terra firma, technical issues, etc.).\n\nshe landed back in US, still recovering from being sick, bought a car, picked up her dog that she left at a friends about 4-6 months back, and booked it back to Colorado.\n\nWe assumed she was planning to get back to her cabin after picking up some of her packages we kept while overseas.\n\nTexted a bit on her journey, and none of the texts were explicit that she intended to stay and not once did she ask us if it was ok, regardless of intent.\n\nMy wife even texted the night before if she planned to stay with us. MIL responded midday, 10 minutes before she showed up, with \u2018Yes\u2019. \n\nDoors were locked and I was in a call - made her wait 10-15. I get down there and said basic greetings. She asked if I was going to let her in, because she needed to use the restroom. I say ok, but we need to have a chat.\n\nTold her that we need to set boundaries - it wasn\u2019t acceptable for her to assume we will host her without being asked with zero notice. She apologized and said she\u2019s been on the road, sick, tired and had a bad month - said it didn\u2019t cross her mind despite us straight up asking the night prior. Even asked why we didn\u2019t remind her (why do I need to remind a 60 something to have manners?).\n\nI iterated that we had told her the same before and this is pattern needs to stop.\n\nShe looked tired and offered her to stay the night but she cannot do it again. She said she wasn\u2019t comfortable staying here, then disengaged and beelined to the garage.\n\nTold her we can talk this through and she started to get passive aggressive, talking over me and being rude - kept acting like she was the victim - I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m etc. I offered a second time for her to stay and she declined again. I said fine and let her get her shit.\n\nOffered to load up the car with her, she declined, told her she\u2019s welcome to come for thanksgiving (\u2018ok\u2019) and she drove off after I went inside.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1700029717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vnj6f/aita_telling_my_mil_she_cant_stay_the_night/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your MIL needs to respect your very reasonable boundaries. Texting 10 minutes before she shows up is completely unacceptable. Like just wow.", "NTA, she has repeatedly shown that she needs you to set boundaries and she has repeatedly shown disregard for those boundaries. Your words were not unkind; they were just not what she wanted to hear.", "NTA. She would drive me nuts. Popping in with no notice and a dog in tow? C'mon. That a lot to expect from anyone. Next time, though, I'd ask my wife to manage giving her the ultimatum. No need for you to always be the bad guy.", "NTA. You both have been patient and accommodating. Prepare yourself for her showing up last minute for thanksgiving- having conveniently forgotten this last conversation.", "My Amazon driver gives me more notice than that. Wow.", "NTA\n\nGood job setting boundaries!\n\nAnd you ultimately did tell your MIL that she could stay one night and she refused.\n\nIt's especially telling that she has removed enough belongings from the car that they had to be \"loaded up\".  She planned to impose on you and your wife for multiple days, or possibly even the winter.", "I know many parents deserved to be treated like this but there's parents that just dont. \n\nWhy reddit hates all parents and in laws \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nIm not saying she is right but for me any person that is like that with them is not right either. \n\nI dont know if theres more to the story but is just sad. Just my opinion", "YTA she just sounds lost to me. And very much alone. Very independent, but still\u2026 having a minor inconvenience or even a major one is not the end of the world. I think that she probably doesn\u2019t reply on the phone because she\u2019s afraid you will blow her off. Make an excuse for why you are just too busy to host her, etc. I know that there\u2019s a lot to this story I don\u2019t know but the way you describe her, I would probably end up making her a room for herself to use any time she wants.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
