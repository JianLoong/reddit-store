If they're seeing someone for this and not being laughed out of the room, it's almost like they need more than olive oil or other over-the-counter remedies.", "You're aware? But yet were JUST saying that doctors don't remove earwax?? You're apparently not as aware as you think you are. \n\nIt doesn't matter what is recommended for MILD cases on anatomically typical ears, it doesn't matter what the NHS says to TRY first. You might have an accident one day and tear your skin, you may be told to first wash the wound, maybe apply antiseptic and keep it clean and covered, and mostly that will work and the wound will heal, sometimes it might get infected and in which case the previous recommendations have failed and now it's time to see a doctor and maybe get antibiotics. The same is true for a whole laundry list of conditions and complaints, including ear wax. I don't know why you keep talking about NHS first step recommendations and you keep repeating that \"all I was doing was giving a cheap tip\" when you know dang well you were actually proclaiming that nobody ever needs to see an MD for earwax, then you tried to say no doctor in the UK removes earwax despite several people from you UK correcting you. Maybe just accept that you don't know as much as you thought you did and stop playing dumb and confused", "My tone was offended because of the way the original comment came off. My roommate has had to deal with a lot of shit from people who think she can't help them because she doesn't have an MD in her title. \n\nI heard about it as an old remedy for just unclogging ears (never done it myself) but not for a condition that requires an ENT or any doctor really.", "Yes, you did, look back at your comments on this thread. It's right there in black and white.\n\n>Still not with docs. Nurse practitioner at the very most.\n\nMaybe you didn't mean to invalidate an NP's work/education, but your wording comes off as extremely rude and \"know it all-ish\". Which is why so many people downvoted your comments.\n\nAnd here is what you said in your initial comment\n\n>Regarding wax. In the UK docs don\u2019t see patients for that issue. A few drops of warm olive oil in the ear can be super helpful. (I assume you may, or others reading this, may have to pay for healthcare and sometimes home remedies save you cash.\n\nOlive oil in the ear, btw, is only recommended for people with conditions that don't need medical a professional intervening, but you're writing it in your initial judgment as though OP doesn't know there are other things out there for ear problems. Most people don't see ENTs unless they're recommended to do so. So that brings up the question of why are *you* bringing it up? Especially when the post isn't even about OPs medical history but about the interaction with the doctor.\n\nIt was unnecessary and makes you look like an ass.\n\nAnd BTW, I only responded to two of your comments and moved on my previous comment that you're now responding to was to someone else who decided they needed to explain (unnecessarily) that NP doesn't go to med school (no sh!t, they go to nursing school). So no, sweetheart, I'm not going to backoff when someone is being an ass to me.\n\nIf you're upset with people being annoyed by your comments and how you're coming off maybe read them over and think about what it was that upset them. Maybe you weren't trying to invalidate someone's experience but you did, just because you didn't mean to doesn't mean it didn't happen.", "You stated that people would need to see \"a nurse practitioner at the most\" for earwax removal. You then stated the existence of OTC products for minor earwax buildup as evidence. That heavily suggests you do not believe that specialist MDs remove earwax or that they are unnecessary, which is not true. Preventative care isn't going to cut it for everyone, especially when uncommon anatomy is at play."]}
