Fair enough for an ENT to ask permission, but not to berate you for being disrespectful after you had declined consent and explained that a random inspection felt dehumanizing.", "NTA. You're a client and absolutely allowed to decide you do not want her services. You're also always allowed to decide you don't want someone looking at or touching your body. You get autonomy of your body, you're not a case to be marvelled at. She was unprofessional and misused the inherent power dynamic for her own curiosity.

In fact, you don\u2019t even need a reason, no means no.

They call themselves doctors, deceptively so. \n\nBut NTA either way.", "NTA she's a specialist for which her only responsibility was the ear wax in your ears.  The manner in which she approached her curiosity about your cleft repair was both insensitive and callous.

Medical treatment requires consent and you did not consent to her examining anything other than your ears. Would it have been okay for her to push to give you a pubic exam? No? Then it isn't okay for her to push any other kind of exam that you didn't specifically request. This wasn't an exploratory infection check, it was a wax removal.", "NTA, but I guess your cleft lip problem is actually not that common. Something like .04% of the population. \n\nHOWEVER, healthcare professionals should be explaining what they are doing before they do it. She did not and never said why she was doing what she was doing. If she thought she had something to offer you, she could have just as easily asked if you were interested.\n\nEvery time I do something to a patient I tell them what I\u2019m doing or if I\u2019m going to touch them and sometimes why.

Cleft palate can impact ear issues and it may have been more prudent to ask why she needed to look there rather than react that way.", "NTA.
