My folks (as well as my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s dad) have been very generous in helping us to pay for a largish wedding (120 people). My father made it clear from the outset that money would not be used as a bargaining chip when it came to what our wedding would look like. Likewise, he said he would help if my mother became to bossy or controlling during the planning process. For the most part we haven\u2019t needed his help, but in a few instances we\u2019ve been pushed into doing things we did not want or envision for ourselves, including inviting guests with whom we have little connection. We\u2019ve let it slide, not wishing to pick fights over ultimately inconsequential things.\n\nHowever, earlier this week we were out for dinner with my folks, and my mom mentioned that she\u2019d found a lovely ivory dress to wear at the wedding. I could tell that my fianc\u00e9e was mortified, but she already had to confront her own mother about this issue and I knew she wasn\u2019t willing to put her foot down with her soon-to-be inlaw, so I took lead and repeatedly said in as gentle a way as possible that no one but my fianc\u00e9e would be wearing white on the wedding day. Everyone laughed it off and conversation led elsewhere.\n\nToday, I called my mother to be sure that she knew we weren\u2019t joking. I told her that she would really hurt my fianc\u00e9es feelings if she were to wear white to the wedding. I admit I screwed up by saying she\u2019d have a relationship with her DIL to mend if she chose to wear white. My mother became quite cross, saying that at her wedding her own mother had worn ivory and no one had cared. She\u2019s from the south and claims that in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s that wasn\u2019t a thing. I reminded her that it was 2023 and where we live it is very much an unspoken rule that only the bride wears all white. She is now furious with me for telling her what she can and cannot wear. My dad has been of little help, claiming he doesn\u2019t really know \u201cwedding etiquette.\u201d\n\nAm I the AH here? I\u2019m sticking by my fianc\u00e9e no matter what, but I\u2019d love some clarity from other perspectives on the issue.", "created_utc": 1686284295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144uypa/aita_for_asking_my_mother_not_to_wear_white_at_my/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's too bad there isn't time to change things around and have the two of you wear a bright color, and have all the guests wear some shade of ivory, white, cream, etc. and really piss off your mother. \n\nI guess it's time to have a talk with your mother and father. Something like \"Mom, I love you very much. However, you will treat me and my fianc\u00e9e appropriately or you won't be allowed to participate.

The issue is that she\u2019s not respecting you nor your fianc\u00e9e by refusing to make the tiniest sacrifice and find a different colored dress.

Anyone else wearing white (or ivory or cream or whatever the fuck) will be refused entry. End of story. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a good opportunity to set boundaries when it comes to the level of respect your mother should be showing your Fiance. \n\nIt\u2019s not weather your mother would be comfortable with someone wearing white to her wedding it\u2019s about weather your fianc\u00e9 is comfortable with it, and she is not so end of discussion. \n\nYour mother wearing white to your wedding would be starting your marriage off on the wrong foot.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding. If I was attending a wedding and the couple said Green is unlucky for us, don\u2019t wear green - I wouldn\u2019t wear green. Because the day is about the couple getting married - nobody else should be getting a say. Also, nobody else wears white at a wedding that\u2019s not done!", "Ask her to try it on for you and when she does bust out laughing and tell her she looks really fat in it. She will find another dress!", "NTA\n\nBut I'd try framing it to her that it's social self destruction if she does this because EVERYONE will notice.", "Keep sticking up for your intended wife.  Make sure to mention to your mom that you will have hired help to thwart anyone who tries to make YOUR day theirs.  As in **red wine designs**......NTA", "Good idea!", "Heck, just Google \"groom's mother wore white.\" She's called \"creepy,\" \"selfish,\" and \"disrespectful.\" People will take pictures, and they will share them. Years from now family members and friends going through the wedding album will stop on her picture and ask who the \"Jocasta\" is. They will post pictures and videos to the Internet, where significant portions of the population can laugh at her.", "Yup, I would probably die of second hand embarrassment if I saw someones mom wear a white dress at their sons/daughters wedding. I wouldn't be embarrassed for the couple, but just the mom wearing white, how desperate and pathetic can one be.", "Exactly this, I was married on 1984 only the bride wears white or a shade of it at that time. Your mother is a liar. Playing power games and acting like she is the bride. Put your foot down now or regret it later! Heck elope if she sticks to her guns and let her enjoy her party. Or have friends ready with red wine to baptize that dress. Let your dad know so he can have an alternate ready for witchy poo. Edited to add NTA", "What?", "If the red wine trick is used, make sure it is the cheapest, darkest red they have.  \n\nI like eloping too.  The threat usually sets off the parents.\n\nAlso perhaps somehow telling mom and dad the wrong information (address) about where to go.  But that is harder to pull of uf there is extended family involved.", "\"You will hurt my fiance\" - \"you will have a relationship to mend with your DIL\" is kind of throwing her under the bus.\n\n\"i only want my fiance to wear white\" would be the sensible thing to say."]}
