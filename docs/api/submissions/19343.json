My father made it clear from the outset that money would not be used as a bargaining chip when it came to what our wedding would look like. Likewise, he said he would help if my mother became to bossy or controlling during the planning process. For the most part we haven\u2019t needed his help, but in a few instances we\u2019ve been pushed into doing things we did not want or envision for ourselves, including inviting guests with whom we have little connection. We\u2019ve let it slide, not wishing to pick fights over ultimately inconsequential things.\n\nHowever, earlier this week we were out for dinner with my folks, and my mom mentioned that she\u2019d found a lovely ivory dress to wear at the wedding. I could tell that my fianc\u00e9e was mortified, but she already had to confront her own mother about this issue and I knew she wasn\u2019t willing to put her foot down with her soon-to-be inlaw, so I took lead and repeatedly said in as gentle a way as possible that no one but my fianc\u00e9e would be wearing white on the wedding day.

I told her that she would really hurt my fianc\u00e9es feelings if she were to wear white to the wedding. I admit I screwed up by saying she\u2019d have a relationship with her DIL to mend if she chose to wear white. My mother became quite cross, saying that at her wedding her own mother had worn ivory and no one had cared. She\u2019s from the south and claims that in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s that wasn\u2019t a thing.

In fact it used to be a thing that the mother of the Groom was to wear beige lace. \n\nThat said, it's now 2023 and it IS a thing. You just don't wear white to a wedding these days. Your Mom is embarrassed probably and that's why she had the reaction she did. Plus it's hard to find something you feel pretty in as an older person, so I'm sure she's thinking, \"Crap! I don't want to start this process again.\"\n\nI'd go over and just talk to her about it. You and your future partner are NTA, but as long as your Mom understands and changes the dress she's NTA either.", "NTA your momma crazy n she is going to drive your wife insane continue sticking up for ur lady as for ur dad backing off I'm with him I think he and I would run away from your momma specially when she gets to that place he noticed that's why your on your own", "NTA that rules been around for decades so she\u2019s talking pish she\u2019s trying to steal attention from the bride don\u2019t let her", "NTA!!!  I agree with one of the other posters.  I would flat out tell her if she wears ivory everyone is going to see it as a desperate, pathetic cry for attention, and a blatant middle finger to your fiance.  It's extremely classless, and will make mom look petty, bitter, and sad.  Then at least if she does show up wearing ivory, she will know in her heart of hearts that this is what people are thinking about her.  I would also ask people to make not-so-subtle remarks about it every chance they got.  She wants attention, so attention she can get!  It will just be negative and people will never forget when she turned up to her own son's wedding dressed like a bride.", "NTA. I hope she wouldn\u2019t be allowed in if she shows up in white. Sounds like she wants to be the bride\u2026. \ud83e\udd22", "my aunties mil wore white and my auntie allowed it bc ppl judge the mil automatically when they see the pictures. Nta", "NTA.   Unless it's a black & white wedding or the bride gives permission for a guest to wear white, it's a no-no.  Especially a mother of the groom dress. Those dresses are usually very detailed & can look like a bride's dress.  The only one who has the right to be furious here is the bride.  Your mother is being very difficult at a time where she should be accomodating.  Planning a wedding can be stressful & she's just adding more of that to your plate when she should be making it easier on you.  As for you dad, he said he'd help & when you asked, he played dumb.  He's an AH too.", "NTA\n\nBut I want to vent because I'm tired of seeing these posts. I don't know if your mother is doing this as a power move. I don't know if you and your fiancee are nipicky over every last detail. It's a dress. Does it resemble a wedding dress because otherwise most people aren't going to notice or care. If it it doesn't then it's not going to cause a disturbance and you're looking for things to ruin your event. I get it. Tradition this tradition that. They can be lovely sometimes, but I personally hate so many of these stupid impositions.\n\nEveryone should learn to relax and enjoy life more. Things are shitty enough.", "Or her Mother did it to her so she wants to pass around the misery. I love that you called her out for that bs 60\u2019s 70\u2019s thing because I wouldn\u2019t have known if that was true or not either but I highly suspected it wasn\u2019t. I think white being only for the bride has probably been a staple since the beginning of time except for maybe Adam and Eve who had no clothes at the beginning.", "Where I was from it wasn't a big deal at all if someone wore white back then.", "I remember when it was customary for the Mother of the groom to wear beige lace. It must be where you're from because in the late 70's, early 80's nobody I know worried about what color they wore to friend's weddings.\n\nIt is a big deal NOW though and Mom needs to get a new dress.", "Er, well you're right the initial fad stated around Queen Victoria's wedding, the rest of your comment in that is ignorant to the historical progression. It didn't really become a traditional thing until the 1930s 1940s after the boom of disposable income and lots of marketing much like the diamond industry at which time it was promoted as a revival fad before becoming a customary piece.", "I think it became a big deal when social media took off, and rude behaviors  became publicized.\n\nWell adjusted people who wouldn't dream of exhibiting rede beawior were astonished at how poorly some people behaved.", "That seems like a major stretch to me, but thanks for explaining what they meant."]}
