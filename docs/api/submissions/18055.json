But at the same time it still sucks feeling left out or excluded, especially by family.\nI'm unsure if this was discussed with Dan as to why he wasn't included or not.\n\nI think Dan and the parents need clear expectations as to what behavior is acceptable for going on a trip/interacting with the family.

Would I make it a regular occurrence? No that would be mean, but sometimes doing things with just Bria that cater to her interests is fine. If you\u2019re comfortable you could even take Dan out for something and if he acts difficult be honest with him, he\u2019s old enough. Likely his life before being adopted was hard, so empathizing will be important, but he\u2019s an adult now and certain behaviors won\u2019t be tolerated.", "YTA. You shouldn't play blatant favorites with your niece and nephew. Especially when its is **just** a beach trip.

That's what he's going to feel and considering some of your replies its pretty clear you have no empathy for him.", "Based off OPs response in comments, YTA here. This kid clearly has issues, but it\u2019s a result of what he went through as a child. \n\nYou may not be his adoptive father, but you are still part of his adoptive family and should try to make an effort instead of singling him out.

Far old enough to know that when you act unpleasant, people aren't going to want to be around you.\n\nMy brother was like that- sulked and bitched and moaned on every trip.  So mom started taking me alone.  When he complained, she asked him, 'if there are 2 people and one constantly complains, sulks, and does their best to make the trip miserable and one person who is thankful, pleasant, and appreciative, who would you want to be around?'

You weren't really the ones to exclude him, his sister asked and there is nothing wrong with spending time with one kid, alone.

He's still young enough he could turn it around.", "NTA but I would go out of my way to do something with just Dan. Sounds like he needs some attention.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. I'm glad you're taking your niece on a vacation her brother CAN'T ruin. Go have fun!", "NTA, but maybe try a different one on one thing with Dan that he would like.

If OP has no intention of doing something kind for Dan, he is TA.  \n\nBria will enjoy the 1:1 time and get a break from her brother. HOWEVER you should do a separate, nice thing for Dan. It doesn't need to mean taking him on vacation, but perhaps a day trip some place he would enjoy or maybe gifting him something meaningful?  Dan acts the way he does because of past trauma.  Be compassionate and kind.", "He\u2019s not a kid.  He\u2019s 18.  NTA", "NTA. As your wife said  \"Dan ruins everything\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA - Oh yes - the sister. She probably could do with a break from him.", "YTA.  Taking just the biological child and not the adopted one is just wrong.  Don\u2019t offer to take one child if you will not take both.  The kid obviously has a trauma background and you have no empathy.", "YTA\n\n  \n\n\nPlaying favourites is never kind, you have acknowledged that Dan's upbringing prior to his adoption has likely impacted his behaviour, this isn't something that's going to change overnight\n\n  \n\n\nBut a great way to make him feel part of the family is to exclude him, good job OP", "Nta because its your choice 100%. However, adopted kids especially the older ones often have anger issues due to a lifetime of rejection. Your actions may well add to the issue he is battling with. Would you be open to some one on one time with him for a day doing something he likes? It would go a long way to showing him the love and acceptance we all crave.", "NTA I don\u2019t think for not wanting him, but you are kinda being an AH with the attitude. Isn\u2019t it likely he is this way due to trauma? Has he been to therapy? Kids like this feel like they have been abandoned their whole lives. They expect to be abandoned. So they get angry and try and push people away instead, to be the one \u201cin control\u201d and drive people away before they can be abandoned. I know he\u2019s 18, but that is still so young. \n\nI would encourage you to encourage your in-laws to get the kid into some therapy asap tbh. And then family therapy too.", "NTA - Dan is old enough to experience the consequences of his behavior, and this sounds like one of those consequences.  Not only that, it's normal to want 1:1 time with each of the children.  If you always excluded Dan from everything, that would be a problem, but I think it's fair to do one thing without him.", "NTA.\n\nIf Dan is known for constantly starting fights then his parents need to help him work through appropriate therapies and workshops.\n\nTake your niece and enjoy your time.\nIf there is a trip in the future that you think Dan would like, you can invite him then.", "NTA it\u2019s a vacation and you\u2019re doing them a favor by taking Bria. If Dan wants to join next trip, maybe SIL can teach him a few manners and how to well-behave in public.", "NTA and SIL can have her own opinion, not that you have to take it seriously. Also a 18 year old is an adult and you don't have to treat them like kids any more. Enjoy your vacation as noone wants to drag along a party spoiler.", "NTA\n\nwhile that is not nice to Dan but as i understand he is not nice to you as well.", "NTA", "YTA after reading further comments. \n\n>Dan is always angry, he misbehaves a lot, doesn't get along with anyone and generally he is not an easy kid to get along with \n\nThis Dan is 18 years old and still misbehaves and is always angry? You'd think by 18 someone would be mature enough to stop being a brat. It's your friends vacation home that you are invited to; if Dan misbehaves that much do you really want your friend to have to deal with him? And what image would it make out for you? Also I'm guessing your friend said you can bring anyone besides yourself and your wife, otherwise why invite Bria. \n\nYour wife and yourself were invited to use the home for vacation. You can invite whomever you want to invite. NTA. It sounds like Dan needs to grow up. He's 18 and will need to face the reality that being a angry brat all the time will get him nowhere in the world.\n\nEdit: \n\n>I meant to say why he has so many issues. Being in foster system for 12 years must be why he is like this\n\nAfter reading this further down from OP in the comments, I'm changing judgement. YTA. Has no one offered to get the kid any help or gone through therapy? Your comments have made it sound like you just don't give a single care about Dan. He maybe a jerk but you just acting like he isn't worth the time isn't going to change him in anyway. Neglecting him isn't going to make him feel wanted regardless of his actions. And leaving out information that he was left in foster care for 12 years is sort of an important piece of detail. Again, you can invite whoever you want, but YTA for not adding this information.", "NTA. Dan is 18. He can go on his own trip. Your niece speaking up speaks volumes. It seems she's comfortable expressing her concern to you more than her own parents. \n\nTo be fair, I'd check to make sure she's actually ok.", "YTA. You are expecting a 18yo kid, who has probably been dealing with rejection already before coming into your family and once hes a part of it, when you can't even do that yourself. All you need to do is read your comments to see that you have cero empathy and you are behaving like an entiteled brat. \n\nI cant even imagine how this poor kid might feel when everyone around him is blaming him, and pushing him aside instead of trying to help him and show him some affection or interest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dan's got problems, that is very clear from the OP and the comments later on in the thread. Being in foster care long-term can really screw kids up. And this is putting strain on EVERYONE involved.\n\nAnd I expect this is all feeding into Dan's feeling of not belonging (pushing everyone away is often a defense mechanism... in their logic it's preventative so they don't get hurt later when they're inevitably kicked out of the group/family/whatever). He acts out because he's angry he doesn't feel part of the family, the family is less inclined to spend time with him, this reenforces the \"I don't belong\" feeling, and the cycle repeats. Taking his sister instead probably magnifies this feeling 100x\n\nIt's not on you to solve these problems for Dan. He needs therapy and help... and hopefully the whole family is able to give him love and support.

Bria\u2019s behavior is getting her a reward, Dan\u2019s behavior is excluding him. Ask for effort, not perfections and put time into this young man.

It is not your responsibility to deal with Dan's issues on vacation. I know from experience what it's like dealing with a volatile and aggressive child on vacation and it literally ruins the whole trip.

Why bother inviting your niece to draw attention to the fact that you have no compassion for Dan, do not like him, and don't want him to come?  You should have just gone on your vacation yourselves.  Now you have created an issue.  If you don't want him to come, don't invite him. Trust me, he is already well aware of what you think of him.", "NTA. \n\nPeople saying you should have a 1:1 make some sense, but you're not the father or mother, and neither did you adopt him. That's not your responsibility at all. You can do it, but chances are that 1:1 is not going to instantly change him. It takes time to change your attitude. \n\nHis circumstances are unfortunate, but that doesn't mean you have to fold or twist to accommodate him.  I have a biological family member like him in his late 30s. He always ruins everything, so we now try to have meetings without him, but my mom always makes a big deal that we should include him to the point she cries and throws a fit. We almost always give in, and sure enough, he starts fighting with everyone and makes the kids cry and the adults unhappy. He has ruined so many gatherings and would be happy moments with his negative attitude. Even at our sisters house in front of her husband, he has caused drama and made their kids, my nieces and nephews, cry. The kids don't want him there either. They tell their mom he ruins their birthdays. \n\nWe've tried 1:1 with him, but he doesn't listen. At this point, it's a lost cause. That aside, you can talk to him, sure, but this isn't just about him.\n\nPeople forget there is a 14f in it as well who has also had a rough time growing up with him and who's also been impacted by his negative behavior. He most likely ruins things for her, which is why she doesn't want him to come. \n\nThis getaway would allow her to relax. So no, I don't think YTA for not taking him. You can talk to him later or before you go, but I would not subject the niece to his shenanigans. He is an adult, and at some point, he has to realize that actions have consequences. The longer he goes without consequences, the longer his attitude will continue. This is exactly what happened with my relative. My mom babied him well into his late 20s, and now he acts like a darn baby. \n\nAlso, not the AH for not wanting to spend time with him. He is difficult, and again, that's not your responsibility. I wonder how many of these people giving you AH have had to deal with people like your nephew. I've been dealing with my relative for years. Even as a child,  we had to support his dramatics. It was intolerable. My mother talked to him, and to this day, nothing has changed. He ruined so many birthdays, gatherings, holidays, graduations, there's very few times were he was cordial. That's how had it was and I can relate to your niece wanting to get out of that.\n\nSo, NTA is in my book.\n\nAnd I would also not want to deal with that. You're in you're right not to want to deal with him. He is 18, old enough to start realizing his attitude makes people weary of him and will continue to do so unless he has changed. \n\nSo go with your niece, and forget about him. He is not going and he is already ruining it. He has what I call a heavy personality. Just puts you in a bad mood thinking about him.", "NTA.\n\nDan is SIL's problem, and SHE needs to get him the help he needs, whether it's therapy, meds, hugs, whatever.\n\nShe took on that responsibility when adopting him, and I'm guessing Dan can tell SIL is regretting her decision, which isn't likely to lead him to nicer behavior.", "INFO: Does Dan even want to go? Has anyone asked him? I don't think sitting at a beach with his aunt & uncle & little sister are at the top of an entertainment list for an 18yr.", "NTA. An explanation does the way you act is very different from a justification or a get-out-of-jail card. While I do feel sympathy for the your nephew's issues, that doesn't change the way that he affects other people, nor does it obligate you to put up with him. I further noticed how everyone else is up in arms about you not caring much for Daniel, and I say \"so what?\" You're neither his parent nor did you choose to adopt him; you're allowed to have preferences, especially when it is based on one child being so much harder to get along with.", "This is a tough one. I think it would be great for Bria to have some alone time to bond with you guys and hang out. However it would also be great for Dan to have that bonding time too, it might help you understand him more, make him open up etc. YTA for treating them differently even tho I can see why Dan frustrates you, but you are also NTA for wanting to take your niece away and let her have fun somewhere she will enjoy.

I'm with OP.", "NTA why would I take someone who would ruin my vacation. Maybe you could have one last conversation with him to see where his head is at. He\u2019s an adult, he can know that his behavior prevents people from wanting to spend time with him", "People are tearing you up on here for not being some sort of saint and wanting to deal with an edgy, angry 18 year old on your vacation. But I personally think you're NTA. The fact of the matter is, he isn't your problem to deal with. All the \"troubled kids need love\" comments seemed to be misdirected at you, when it is his adopted parents job to fill that role. If after 6 years, he's still acting this way, they need counseling to figure things out. But that isn't on you, and the comments really seem to think it is for some reason haha. People on here always like to mention how different kids get different opportunities, and how that's just life. And it's true. But that's exactly what this is. I was once an angry teen too, and I had a tough fucking life. But I still knew how to play nice so I could be a part of things. Lastly, it's never even mentioned if Dan WANTS to go and no one seems to be taking that into account either", "I'm leaning YTA. I get that Dan is hard to get along with, but it's still really shitty that you'd invite one kid and leave the other out. IMO, it's both or neither of them. Or, if the beach really isn't Dan's thing, you should make an effort to do something one-on-one that he would enjoy so he doesn't feel left out. I have a niece and nephew and they are both very different kids. I try my hardest to make sure they don't feel left out or that I love and care about one more than the other. I have a much stronger bond with my niece, so I acknowledge that this can be hard to do, but you really have to make the effort.\n\nEdited: sorry OP, after reading your comments, strong YTA. It's very clear you have some animus against Dan and just don't feel like dealing with him. Since you felt the need to mention that Dan was adopted, I'm betting you've probably been making him feel like an outsider since he was 12.", "YTA, obvi. It's quite contradictory of you to refer to him as a \"kid\" in your post, and then say he's an adult and should act like one in your comments. You know what you're doing, and it's downright hateful. I hope it storms every day on your vacation.", "YTA   \n\n\nUnless you have scheduled another trip with one on one time for Dan you are being an asshole.    \n\n\nIt is unfair to not treat them equally.   It doesn't have to be at the same time.   But it still  needs to be.   Maybe he's too much to deal with in certain situations.. then find ones that you can both be content with.     \n\n\nFavoritism really sucks.      \n\n\nI'm nearly 60... and my father's dislike of me still affects every day of my life.

One is a huge dick who makes things unpleasant for everyone around them. They never had real repercussions for that. They would \u201cget in trouble\u201d but have no real consequences and continued to be invited to things, and treated just like the other nice siblings. Some times their behavior was so bad they would be left out of a group thing, but then get their own solo thing to make up for it. Aka, no real meaningful consequences. They continued to be cruel, bratty, intentionally offensive, and some times abusive. We\u2019re all in our mid to late 30 now. That one sibling is still a miserable shit to be around. Actions should have consequences. Being excluded from a vacation because of poor behavior seems reasonable to me. How is it more fair for the uncle to PAY for the 18 yr old to come on his vacation just for the boy to ruin it for the 3 other people there?  My extended family would never have taken my asshole sibling on trip, because they\u2019re an asshole. Seems reasonable enough to me. \n\n\nPeople assuming that any behavior issue is the result of pre adoption trauma, we don\u2019t know that. However, if that is the case then the correct steps are therapy, individual and family. The uncle taking him on a vacation isn\u2019t going to \u201cfix\u201d anything.

I understand he has not had the easiest upbringing, but that\u2019s not yours to correct. He is an adult now and he needs to learn that his actions and attitudes are what dictate whether or not people want to be around him. If he is having such a hard time then he needs to be in some intense therapy to work through whatever he is dealing with. Maybe once he has done some healing work he will be better able to appreciate and enjoy trips and outings without making other people miserable.", "So you\u2019re going to exclude the kid that probably has trauma, already feels different and excluded and lesser-than since he\u2019s adopted, and blatantly favour his sister? Yup, YTA. A big one.", "YTA - kids don't sulk in their room, lash out, or cause problems for no reason. And isolating them from their family further and showing they aren't welcome can't help. That doesn't mean that you have to bring him on the trip but it does mean that you should try to include him where you can. If you've asked him if he wants to come and he doesn't, fine.

I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll do wonders for his self esteem! Honestly if you were my friend and you told me this, we would no longer be friends.

Do you understand the amount of trauma that can come from that? He was likely bouncing around foster homes for majority of his life. Especially if he only found a long term home at age 12. He was old enough to feel all the trauma and pain. He\u2019s likely angry at the world and at the people who gave him up. It\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to get to him, because I guarantee he has put up walls to shut people out. That kid is likely hurt, lonely and terrified. That is why he acts out. He doesn\u2019t just do it for fun and it is NOT fair to judge him. This post disgusts me, Op you have no empathy.", "YTA, if the worst thing that you can say is that he's going to be in his room all day and therefore you're going to ignore his existence and act like your sibling has one child. \n\nI don't think that you have to join big brothers and big sisters, become a foster care parent and use your vacation time to mentor this young man. I'm just saying that if you're going to invite people for a family event you can't pick and choose who is family. You didn't give any example of something that is so outrageous that he deserves to be no contact in your life. You didn't even say that he's actually disrespectful to YOU. \n\nI was the socially awkward niece that my mother's siblings ignored and took all of their children to amusement parks. I was socially awkward because I was ignored, I was ignored because I was socially awkward. Even now, my uncle is asking me if I'm going to spend a couple hundred dollars to go to the family reunion, and I have no desire to do that just to be a part of a photo. He'll ask me why I never call him, and I'll point out to him that he's got my number just like I have his. I don't think that it is a child's responsibility to build a relationship with an adult, and now that I'm an adult too I'm not going to magically grow a desire to make a relationship where no one cultivated one. \n\nLet's get to the meat and potatoes, you don't love this boy so the fact that you don't like him stands out brighter.  You don't love him so you don't feel any compulsion to build a relationship with him. *shrug* Don't be the AH who makes it the kids fault that you don't love him. If you had held him in your arms when he was a baby, you'd love him, and you'd be willing to stick out his angry teenage phase. Or, I don't know, you may be the sort of person that sees children as tiny adults, and do you feel that if a kid is unlikable you treat them like you would a coworker.", "YTA.

Give the guy a chance. He probably already feels like u favor bria", "YTA.

You don\u2019t have to pay for a vacation for a teen/adult who you don\u2019t get along with. \n\nFoster care is probably the reason for his behavior, but it\u2019s not an excuse for his behavior. He needed therapy as a kid, continuing therapy as an adult and he needs to learn how to treat and exist with others. Bad behavior = being left out of fun things with other people. That\u2019s a universal consequence no matter what age you are. \nYou are not required to take a shitty teen/adult on vacation with you just because they are family. \nThat being said, I do have some questions. \n\n1) did you ask DAN if he even wants to go on vacation with you? Or does SIL just want to have a break from him for a week. \n2) if DAN does want to go, did you explain the behavior you expect and will tolerate on this trip and what you will not? \n- you can\u2019t expect a moody angry teedult to magically change his behavior overnight, but you can lay some ground rules for the trip and if he agrees to them, you could give him the chance. He may act differently away from his parents. \n\nI\u2019m sure you love both your niece and nephew, but it makes sense that you prefer to spend time with the better behaved one.

I think everyone is focusing on Dan's needs to the exclusion of Bria's, including her father. It can be hard to be the sibling of a kid who has a lot of needs (ask me how I know), and I can understand why she wanted time away, and why the adults wanted to grant it. \n\nDan's dad could have used this as an opportunity for 1:1 time with Dan. I think he's choosing to be angry in part because he feels defensive of Dan and in part because he wanted a break from parenting. While I can understand both, I think he could have handled those feelings more calmly and in a way that fostered more discussion. \n\nPerhaps after the trip, if Dan even wants to, you could find something to do with just him. I'm guessing if you show interest in him and try to do something nice for him, he'll try to engage instead of sulking.", "NTA \n\nDan sounds like a pain and he's not your kid.

He had to compromise while we went to doctors, physical therapy etc.   So the younger one loses out because of the brother's bad behavior.\n\nTake him on a test run - out to dinner as a group or something.

But it makes her feel special.\n\nI can take her out and have time with her without being unkind to my difficult nephew. I just ask if he wants to do other things and make sure the ball is in his court and text him later, 'do you still want to get coffee/ do other thing?'
