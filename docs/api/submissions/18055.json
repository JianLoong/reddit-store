But at the same time it still sucks feeling left out or excluded, especially by family.\nI'm unsure if this was discussed with Dan as to why he wasn't included or not.\n\nI think Dan and the parents need clear expectations as to what behavior is acceptable for going on a trip/interacting with the family.

Would I make it a regular occurrence? No that would be mean, but sometimes doing things with just Bria that cater to her interests is fine. If you\u2019re comfortable you could even take Dan out for something and if he acts difficult be honest with him, he\u2019s old enough. Likely his life before being adopted was hard, so empathizing will be important, but he\u2019s an adult now and certain behaviors won\u2019t be tolerated.", "YTA. You shouldn't play blatant favorites with your niece and nephew. Especially when its is **just** a beach trip.

This kid clearly has issues, but it\u2019s a result of what he went through as a child. \n\nYou may not be his adoptive father, but you are still part of his adoptive family and should try to make an effort instead of singling him out.

Far old enough to know that when you act unpleasant, people aren't going to want to be around you.\n\nMy brother was like that- sulked and bitched and moaned on every trip.

However, adopted kids especially the older ones often have anger issues due to a lifetime of rejection. Your actions may well add to the issue he is battling with. Would you be open to some one on one time with him for a day doing something he likes? It would go a long way to showing him the love and acceptance we all crave.", "NTA I don\u2019t think for not wanting him, but you are kinda being an AH with the attitude. Isn\u2019t it likely he is this way due to trauma? Has he been to therapy? Kids like this feel like they have been abandoned their whole lives. They expect to be abandoned. So they get angry and try and push people away instead, to be the one \u201cin control\u201d and drive people away before they can be abandoned. I know he\u2019s 18, but that is still so young. \n\nI would encourage you to encourage your in-laws to get the kid into some therapy asap tbh. And then family therapy too.", "NTA - Dan is old enough to experience the consequences of his behavior, and this sounds like one of those consequences.  Not only that, it's normal to want 1:1 time with each of the children.  If you always excluded Dan from everything, that would be a problem, but I think it's fair to do one thing without him.", "NTA.\n\nIf Dan is known for constantly starting fights then his parents need to help him work through appropriate therapies and workshops.\n\nTake your niece and enjoy your time.\nIf there is a trip in the future that you think Dan would like, you can invite him then.", "NTA it\u2019s a vacation and you\u2019re doing them a favor by taking Bria. If Dan wants to join next trip, maybe SIL can teach him a few manners and how to well-behave in public.", "NTA and SIL can have her own opinion, not that you have to take it seriously. Also a 18 year old is an adult and you don't have to treat them like kids any more.

You'd think by 18 someone would be mature enough to stop being a brat. It's your friends vacation home that you are invited to; if Dan misbehaves that much do you really want your friend to have to deal with him? And what image would it make out for you? Also I'm guessing your friend said you can bring anyone besides yourself and your wife, otherwise why invite Bria. \n\nYour wife and yourself were invited to use the home for vacation. You can invite whomever you want to invite. NTA. It sounds like Dan needs to grow up. He's 18 and will need to face the reality that being a angry brat all the time will get him nowhere in the world.\n\nEdit: \n\n>I meant to say why he has so many issues. Being in foster system for 12 years must be why he is like this\n\nAfter reading this further down from OP in the comments, I'm changing judgement. YTA. Has no one offered to get the kid any help or gone through therapy? Your comments have made it sound like you just don't give a single care about Dan. He maybe a jerk but you just acting like he isn't worth the time isn't going to change him in anyway. Neglecting him isn't going to make him feel wanted regardless of his actions. And leaving out information that he was left in foster care for 12 years is sort of an important piece of detail. Again, you can invite whoever you want, but YTA for not adding this information.", "NTA. Dan is 18. He can go on his own trip. Your niece speaking up speaks volumes. It seems she's comfortable expressing her concern to you more than her own parents. \n\nTo be fair, I'd check to make sure she's actually ok.", "YTA. You are expecting a 18yo kid, who has probably been dealing with rejection already before coming into your family and once hes a part of it, when you can't even do that yourself. All you need to do is read your comments to see that you have cero empathy and you are behaving like an entiteled brat. \n\nI cant even imagine how this poor kid might feel when everyone around him is blaming him, and pushing him aside instead of trying to help him and show him some affection or interest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Dan's got problems, that is very clear from the OP and the comments later on in the thread. Being in foster care long-term can really screw kids up. And this is putting strain on EVERYONE involved.\n\nAnd I expect this is all feeding into Dan's feeling of not belonging (pushing everyone away is often a defense mechanism... in their logic it's preventative so they don't get hurt later when they're inevitably kicked out of the group/family/whatever). He acts out because he's angry he doesn't feel part of the family, the family is less inclined to spend time with him, this reenforces the \"I don't belong\" feeling, and the cycle repeats. Taking his sister instead probably magnifies this feeling 100x\n\nIt's not on you to solve these problems for Dan.

You'd think by now he'd be a little more mature and behave himself. He was adopted at age 12, maybe he's resentful over that fact? Maybe his birth parents passed away or lost him due to something they did when he was 12, or he was sitting in a foster center for awhile? Even so, you'd think he'd be mature enough to be thankful a family adopted him regardless of situations.\n\nEdit: after reading further comments and replies from OP he states that Dan was left in foster care for 12 years. 12 years of feeling like no one wants you is going to screw up anyone beyond belief. And OP acts like Dan isn't worth his time.", "You'll want to edit the top level comment for it to count", "I would do some research into what likely happened to your nephew in the foster system. It is very likely he was abused at some point. So while maybe the vacation is not the best idea but there must be something he would like doing. Waterpark, batting cages, go karting, paintball are all day activities you could possible do 1 on 1 with him.", "So you *do* actually realise the events behind his behaviour, but still exclude him?\nThat's really sad.  \ud83d\ude22\n\nYTA - and I hope he finds some people willing to see past his self-protective exterior.", ">Being in foster system for 12 years must be why he is like this\n\nIt is, 100%. Maybe consider that it wasn't his fault and adults failed him for the first 12 years of his life (not that you've made his last 6 better).", "I mean, no shit, but have you not read books regarding the problems that children in the foster system have? Do you not talk to support groups or a child therapist to get a handle on the situation? It's been six years. It sounds like you decided early on that he's not worthwhile. Which. If that's the case then yeah please stay away from him. But stop validating your niece's attitude towards him, too.", "The fact that his sister and his uncle are willing to sideline him so casually, his father doesn\u2019t argue, and only his mother thinks it makes you TA is, I\u2019m sure, not at all helping. Have you always shown so little interest in helping your nephew?", "AH\u2019s always shine in the comments", "Even \"moody\" kids have interests. How ever, kids from foster care are used to not expect things and to not ask for things. So maybe just talk to Dan and ask him what he would like to do if he had the full freedom to pick anything. Make sure you don't promise to much but honestly say you would like to get to know him better and you will try to arrange what he asks for. Be nice! And interested. You don't play favourite with siblings, not even when their someone else's kid.", "Or maybe, just maybe, you can try being an adult and try to find a way for both kids to enjoy, or find the reason why he is sulking. The fact you have zero empathy for this poor kid is just...", "maybe give the kid a chance and try to get to know him, i\u2019m sorry he\u2019s been negative, but leaving him out won\u2019t make it better", "I know you are just being a jerk, but honestly? Yeah. If he\u2019s so sad that he\u2019s always sulking, be with him while he\u2019s sad without trying to change how he feels. That\u2019s called \u2728emotional support\u2728.", "YTA. You don\u2019t deserve the privilege of going on vacation with either of these kids. Your lack of compassion, lack of empathy, clear favoritism, and willingness to shun a kid for a situation he did nothing to create are stunningly toxic. If I was your sibling you wouldn\u2019t get near either of my kids with that attitude.", "If they're both sulky, why is he the one you dislike for it?", "That's valid lol", "Found the asshole", "Bahaha, and there's the asshole.", "18 may legally be an adult but a fresh 18yo is still a child.", "So then you\u2019re planning on treating him like an adult, and sitting down with him to talk about what behaviors and actions would be expected on such a trip? \n\nNo, you won\u2019t do that because you are simply talking to his parents and sibling about him, like he\u2019s a kid, and holding stuff against him that he did \u201cfor the last six years,\u201d as a kid. \n\n You clearly don\u2019t like him and have no empathy for what he may have been through as a kid before being adopted. And no interest in getting to know him or being a consistent person on his life he could count on. Someone who cares. Which he needs more of, not less. YTA", "INFO: do you view him as family? Is there a chance you\u2019re harsher in your judgment of him, but kinder in your judgment of your niece because she\u2019s biologically related?\n\nI ask because in your comments you have no empathy towards him and think that because he\u2019s 18, he should be fixed by now.", "You need to look up what trauma can do to a kid's development. His biological age may be 18, but his emotional age is likely much younger.", "He is barely an adult. Young adult brains keep developing into the 20's. Did you have overnight perfect maturation at age 18?", "Yet you\u2019re acting like one", "Your behaviour seems childish to me, so what's your excuse then?\n\nHurt people hurt people, and you've just increased the hurt he feels by siding with his sister like its some school play ground popularity contest.\n\nHow's that going to play out now and in the future? He's young, he's angry and you've just given him another kick, so this goes one of two ways:\n\nHe turns in on himself, so expect some self-harm and or substance abuse (one and the same thing).\n\nHe turns on those who've exacerbated the problem.\n\nYou have the perfect opportunity to actually do something towards mending this situation, offering a hand of friendship at this time might tangibly help everyone's life here.\n\nYou're an adult, he's technically an adult, the pair of you could go off somewhere and do something man to man where he gets the opportunity to not be that shitty kid - he might surprise you.", "If my nephew was having a hard time because of serious fucking trauma, my priority would be being one of the people he can trust and who adds nothing but love and joy and acceptance into his life. \n\nBeing an aunt/uncle is an amazing opportunity to be there for a kid without all the daily baggage parents have to climb over. I love my nephew and I would NEVER agree with a remark like \"X ruins everything.\" Are you serious??\n\nWho the fuck agrees with sentiments like that aimed at an abused child?\n\nSomeone or multiple people ruined everything for Dan, and you decided to join the club.\n\nHoly shit are YTA", "Dealing with what? Him staying in his room.\n\nTaking a trip with just your niece is okay as everyone says, but only if you do something equal with just him. Or invite him to. If he turns it down that is his choice.\n\nYou are the Asshole though when it comes to your attitude towards him. You keep talking about him being an adult like turning 18 magically takes away a shitty childhood and yet here you are acting like a grudge holding child yourself. You are supposed to be more mature and more of the adult here and yet you can\u2019t pull it off. And you expect an 18 year old to?", "The way you double down on this like having no empathy or compassion for a troubled teenager in your own family is somehow admirable, is really something. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the something you think it is.", "If he's committing anything like assault and battery. If he's just committing \"emo\" or \"pain in the ass,\" you can't charge him.", "He also needs acceptance, and the way OP talks about this kid in the comments I\u2019m not convinced Dan\u2019s behavior extends much past being \u201csulky\u201d around OP because he\u2019s all too aware that OP doesn\u2019t like him at all.", "Yeah I read some of the comments but now have read more. Definitely TH lol.", "Again not a shred of empathy for someone who was in the foster system until they were 12. One of the shittiest institutions in the world. 18 is **NOT** an adult except by the legal definition, no one at that age is even a full person yet. And unless his family has the money for therapy it'll be a LONG time before he gets over what he went through.\n\nI'd hope your SIL would ban you from interacting with her kids but since she hasn't seen the way you've been acting here I guess you're free to poison his family's opinion about him freely.", "Wow you a cold AH. Adopted at 12. Could be the kid has trauma and acting out because of it. Kids pick up when they arent liked or treated equally.", "But is he in therapy?\n\nIt\u2019s great that your bro adopted an older kid, but he had to know this child would come with some issues.  It\u2019s been years, what are they doing to help him?", "As long as the people around him act like you and don't care about him, don't expect him to change anytime soon.", "Does he become an adult the day he have his 18th birthday or is he giving a grace period?\nIm sorry but you are a huge asshole and its clear that you don't like Dan nor have any kind of empathy towards him. I think im not too far if i say its because hes adopted.", "Gosh, you're such an asshole.", "He's only just an adult and he probably had a really shitty start to life.", "why even post here if you've already decided you're not the asshole?", "18 is legally an adult but not emotionally or mentally necessarily. Is Dan in therapy? How much of his attitude is self preservation from being in foster care most of his life?", "Does he like you?", "Are you asking yourself why so many people are saying YTA? Are you thinking of ways to change your behavior? Or do you hold your 18 year old nephew to higher standards than you hold yourself to?", "Is he required to like the nephew? Is he required to ignore the wishes of his niece to get away from her brother for a few days?", ">Dan is always angry, he misbehaves a lot\n\n5 sentences in.", "Actually, it was the niece, Dan's sister.", "Well, not really a surprise given the described behavioural patterns of said young man, isn't it?", "I think that's asking a lot without knowing what his deal is. And even if he's trying to work on his emotional baggage, kids will often lash out at people they feel will not desert them for their outbursts and sulks.\n\nHe sounds depressed and jaded, from the little that OP mentioned. Like I understand they don't want him there, but I also know that people who included me even when I wasn't at *my* brightest and best probably saves my life and gave me good examples of how to be a good adult.", "Agreed that Dan is old enough to be learning to manage his feelings better, adoption is always a product of trauma and loss, more so when the child has been in foster care and is older. \u2018Thankfulness\u2019 gets pretty complicated, and trauma has lifelong effects.", "It counts the top comment - I dont have that, so I\u2019m good.", "Yep, definitely makes.it worse that OP acknowledged Dan's trauma and the reasons for it and is still like \"Nah, kid might be grouchy so I'm not taking him. \"", "I've know him for 6 years he is not gonna change in a day", "This. 18 May legally be an adult, but as someone who was once 18 pretty much everyone should know from experience,  mentally and emotionally there are still a few good years before most people fully mature.", "Exactly what I thought. OP is the epitome of hipocresy", "angry and misbehaving does not mean violent", "that's what i meant for sister", "Thus perpetuating his anger. If he was adopted at 12, that likely means there were bad things that happened to/around this kid for the first two-thirds of his life. Making him feel unwanted on a family outing is not a good way to deal with that anger. It reinforces it.", "Don't breed.", "No, reading further comments, OP is definitely a AH. Dan was put into foster care for 12 years. Feeling unwanted and neglected for 12 years would screw anybody up, and OP just acts like Dan isn't worth his time.", "Fair enough, you're the second one down but I guess it's pretty unanimous anyway", "Six years of projecting adult expectations and resentment onto a child who was in the foster system until the age of 12 and saw god-knows-what before that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s changed a lot in six years. You, on the other hand, display the black-and-white thinking of a sheltered child.", "Maybe if you started trying six years ago it would be different. YTA.", "Could he be this way around you because of your very blatant dislike of him? Yta try to build a better relationship with him.", "So you've had 6 years to get to know him as something more than a troubled, adopted kid, and all you know about him is that he \"ruins everything\". You are truly the AH here. Even if he's one of the \"lucky\" ones that didn't experience abuse, two thirds of his life was with another family (or families, or government homes) and only one third has been with the family he has now.\n\nIt's fine to want to have 1 on 1 time with family. It's incredibly cruel to love your niece and not your nephew.", "Something tells me you didn't give him a chance 6 years ago either.", "YTA all day.", "you also have no fucking idea what kind of trauma that kind went through", "Yeah I can let someone else have this one. Thank you though!", "Adults can tell he doesn't like the kid from one paragraph imagine the latent hostility on this kids radar from uncle awesome here.", "Exactly and if he came into OPs family at 12 that's years of blatant hostility. Of course he's angry."]}
