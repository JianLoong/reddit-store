Calling animal control might be the best option for you, but may not be for the dog if it's hyper aggressive and old. They might just put it down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their dog hasn't hurt anyone so far, but she has escaped before and lunged at my dog, who was on a chain in our yard (and therefore trapped). I had to throw myself between their dog and mine. They didn't care. Their dog sits outside (or in their open window) and barks relentlessly. My husband and I haven't really been able to hang out in our yard since they got this dog.\n\nI was just sitting outside trying to read and their dog was barking in my face over their fence. I tried to ignore it for twenty minutes, but I just couldn't anymore. I went over there and knocked on the door and said, \"I'm sorry to bother you, but your dog is barking right in my face.\" Her entire (rather aggressive) response basically boiled down to: \"She's a dog,\" which she said repeatedly. \"There's nothing I can do.\" I asked if she could try to keep the dog on the other side of the yard while I'm out there. She said, \"I can't keep her inside all day,\" which is not what I asked, but it was clear at this point that she wasn't going to listen, as she had begun complaining about having to pay $5K out of pocket for damage to her fence and pool done by one of our trees (which both of our insurance companies agreed we weren't liable for, since it fell in a storm). I did feel bad about the fence / pool, but it wasn't our fault. And anyway, it felt like she was just bringing up a past grievance to deflect from her behavior. At that point, I just said, \"ok, thanks\" and walked away.\n\nMy husband and I are putting up a privacy fence (which we don't *really* have the money for, but I can't take this anymore). But I seriously doubt it will do anything, since the dog barks day and night whether she can see us or not. I'm sure she'll just smell us through the fence and continue to torture us.\n\nIf this doesn't work, WIBTA for calling animal control? We can't move, as we own our house. I'm just stuck with this if something doesn't give, and I'd like to think a visit from animal control would send the message that this is patently uncool behavior. We deserve to be able to sit in our backyard.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a bad dog owner that lets their dog do that too. Sure dogs bark, but when it's for hours, that's just a shitty owner/neighbor. \n\nDo you have a non emergency line you can call for a noise complaint? After so many calls for the same thing, people get fined for it.", "NTA\n\nI love dogs. But I'm sure most people don't have an issue with dogs. As someone who has a dog that loves to bark I sympathize with the neighbors. But, I'd still report them. \n\n1. It seems like they've had time to come up with solutions to the issue and have chosen not to. \n2. The neighbors could minimize the issue by having the dog be inside more often than not. Sure, it needs to be outside to play too, but, it shouldn't be to the point of where you can't use your own yard. \n3. You had to risk yourself to stop it from going to your own dog. What if it bit your dog? What if it bit you? Leashes exist.", "INFO \n\nWhat are the local laws inre dog's barking incessantly? Where I live in NY I doubt you'd get any government agency involved if the dog hasn't bitten anyone yet. \n\nI would file a complaint with animal control about the dog coming into your yard to try to attack your dog. That way you can prove a pattern if it should happen again. Also, record the dog barking while videoing on a  meter that shows how many decibels the dog's bark is producing. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. \nI don't know where you live, but in my country you would probably have more success with the police than animal control as their dog is causing noise pollution.", "YWNBTA if you call in a complaint in my opinion. You could try talking to the neighbors again and tell them if they don't make an effort to work with you, you will take action. But it's seems (at least the woman) they might not nice to work with. \n\nIf they are renters you could try calling their landlord. That's a crappy situation, I hope it turns out well!\n\nYou deserve to have some peaceful time!!", "You keep your own dog on a chain and judge your neighbors as bad dog owners. You're all bad dog owners. \n\nWhere I live it's illegal to chain your dog, people just fence their yard.", "You WBTAH.\n\nI understand being frustrated with your neighbors. I would be as well. They are definitely being assholes about the situation.\n\nHowever, animal control would be a dick move that honestly will only blow back in your face.\n\nIt's sad to hear that the fence is going to be a strain on your finances, but that's the best step to at least make sure that the dog isn't going to be a nuisance/threat within your space and property.\n\nWith the dog barking, I'm going to be pretty blunt. Dogs do that. If you have an HOA, I would bring up the issue with them. Loud dogs are some of the most common complaints that they have and for the most part they will try to fix the issue. Especially if you can get other neighbors to send complaints as well. However they might choose to ignore all of that and so, while annoying, you don't have many options left. \n\nAt this point, or if you don't have an HOA, I would call the cops. A disturbance such as this, along with the accounts of the dog escaping, would warrant them to talk to the neighbors. Again, they can also ignore this too and now you are really out of options.\n\nBoth these options might get blowback in the form of hard feelings but animal control might have worse outcomes. Check if they send dogs to no-kill shelters. If you can't really prove that your neighbors are being neglectful then they might make you pay to get the dog back from the shelter. And if the dog is put down, you might be facing a worse damages fee.", "NTA\n\nDog barking is a public nuisance.  Most locales will take action even with daytime barking, provided it's not just occasional.\n\nIn my experience, you need to document every five minutes that the dog is barking.  For as long a period as you can tolerate.  Turn a copy of that documentation into animal control when you make your complaint.  There may be a requirement to go through this process a couple of times.  You should look up the requirements in your area.  Animal Control should have a website.", "NTA \n\nThis happened to us with our dog. We didn't realize she would bark the whole day when we were gone. The neighbor bought a shock collar (don't agree with that) and gave it to us. We just worked on training her to not bark as much and the neighbor was happy! Sorry they were so rude. No one's dog should be barking for hours.", "I didn\u2019t just leave her out there on a chain by herself. I was out there with her. We haven\u2019t been able to afford a full fence, so when we\u2019re outside she\u2019s on a (nice, long) line. That way, she can play (again, it\u2019s a long line) without us worrying about her running away. I do not \u201ckeep her on a chain.\u201d", "I certainly do not want anything bad to happen to their dog, which is why I\u2019ve hesitated about this \u2014 and why I\u2019m asking you all (thank you for your response).\n\nI know dogs bark, but this is obscene levels of barking. They have had several dogs for years, and we were completely copacetic until they got this new dog. I\u2019ll admit, my dog barks. As you said, dogs do that. But I do not let my dog stand outside and bark at my neighbors for hours. That\u2019s just horrible manners, if nothing else.\n\nI do not have an HOA. I live in a rural area. One of her objections to my request (to just bring her dog inside while I\u2019m out there) was \u201cwe moved to the country so\u2014\u201c after which she transitioned into the pool thing. And I do get that, and we are in the country, but our houses are very close together. Like 15 feet. Which may not seem like a lot, but when their dog is in their open window facing our house, that bark travels.\n\nI appreciate your response. I agree it\u2019s drastic, and as I said I don\u2019t want any harm to come to the dog. I\u2019m just at a loss. The fence is not going to end this.", ">Dogs do that.\n\nNo, they don't and shouldn't.  Barking at something isn't the same as incessant, non-stop barking all day long.  I have beagles, one of the breeds most notorious for barking.      This is 100% on the dog owners for not training their dogs and causing a disturbance.", "Fair play to you, you are a respectful and reasonable neighbour. I'd love to live beside someone like you.", "Good... In this case NTA"]}
