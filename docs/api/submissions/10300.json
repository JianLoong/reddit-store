You had talked to her about it before, and she chose to ignore you. It's YOUR home. She doesn't get to make you and your guests uncomfortable in your own home. I'm glad SO agrees with you, but he should have been willing to talk to his mother instead of it getting to this point.", "NTA\n\nI get in some families that might be normal, but only nuclear families not extended families and not for everyone and not if she's been asked not to.", "NTA. Ew. The only time it's acceptable to use the bathroom with the door open is when you're alone. Or if it's just you and your young kids and you need to be able to hear them. But an adult leaving the bathroom door open while there are other adults around? Yuck. You were right to call her out.", "NTA. It\u2019s odd. Does she live alone? I live alone and never close the door when no one else is here. But I\u2019d never not close the door if a guest was over or if I was at any other setting.", "NTA. You were rude, you just tried a different approach.", "**NTA**\n\nYour MIL is an exhibitionist. She gets a thrill from doing inappropriate things in public situations and/or where people can 'catch' her (I'd actually be interested to know if she behaves inappropriately in any other ways).\n\nThis is not a matter of \"how her family does it\" (your husband, her son, is equally mortified by it). It's not a matter of \"because she lives alone\" (lots of us live alone and we still know to close the bathroom door when we're around other people, because we are competent adults). She is not forgetting. *She has been spoken to specifically and repeatedly about this behaviour* and not only continues to do it, but PUSHES BACK when asked not to (which means it's not dementia either). And she does it not only around family members but when you have guests in your home.\n\nThis is entirely deliberate. \n\nAnd you're right that it's not going to stop. And while it's not a HUGE deal while your kids are this young, the older one is already noticing that it doesn't fit with what she is being taught about privacy and appropriate behaviour (hence closing the door for grandma), and it is going to be more and more uncomfortable as they get older. Tell her she's not welcome in your home until she can learn to use the bathroom like a respectable member of society. Your 4-year-old can, so can she. When she pushes back, tell her that's fine, she doesn't have to come over anymore. Hold that line. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want her teaching your impressionable children that rude behavior.  \n\nWho knows why she wants to expose everyone to listening and possibly seeing her pee or poop.  \n\nPersonally I would have slammed that damn door on her.

Not OK behaviour,  and you told her in front of your cousin because she exposed herself in front of your cousin...\n\nIs the door ajar or wide open?? Struggling to see her side", "NTA, your house, your rules. \n\nShe's being so disrespectful. Family members are often the hardest people to set and enforce boundaries with, especially if they're older. You need to stand your ground on this and your SO needs to keep backing you since it's his mom.", "NTA.  You've asked her repeatedly and she's refused.  I'm curious - does she have some sort of mental issue or exhibitionism otherwise?", "You're NTA, but she is one.  That's weird, and gross.

Furthermore violating THAT social norm in someone else's home is beyond rude. To continue to do so after being asked not to is to be openly disrespectful and defiant.

I have a really big issue with people potentially hearing or knowing I\u2019m using the bathroom, and at home I live alone with cats.. we all know how much cats like to break in, so I leave the door open for them. But my fear of PEOPLE knowing I\u2019m in there makes me paranoid anywhere else. Even in relationships it\u2019s an issue for me. I do not understand going to an entire other person\u2019s house and doing that.
