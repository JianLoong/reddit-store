We concluded that participants are, in general and in principle, favorable to the presence of dogs in organizations. Our informants mentioned the positive impact on social cohesion, a feeling of community, and an increase of the information exchange. We showed that pet-friendly policies may be positive, but also that they are not always positive, revealing boundary conditions for organizational pet policies. Therefore, pet-friendly policies are only effective if they are implemented genuinely and hand in hand with the company\u2019s culture and atmosphere and not as a mere instrument to increase job satisfaction and engagement or to improve employee branding.\n\n\n\nDogs in the workplace CAN have an increase in cohesion and positivity in specific situations and conditions. however, having a sudden large change in policy like this can be incredibly divisive. not everyone finds this sort of environment a positive experience, and if OP was just applying to a job like this to find out that dogs are allowed to be in the office all day, they might not have ever accepted the job. \n\n\nSee also:\n\n>Our findings have business implications.

Further research should investigate what the extent of the consequences are for employees and the company if the culture and the management are not ready for dogs at the office. In addition, while the study showed that dogs enhance the social capital of a company, the degree of job satisfaction and performance is still underexplored.

It\u2019s a bit of an entitled attitude, and it shows a lack of empathy towards the coworkers.\n\nWow, it's astonishing how you try to turn this - OP didn't take anything from them because they didn't have it in the first place. That's a HUGE difference. If OP came into the office knowing about dogs being there and trying to change that, yes.  \n\n\nBut you depict this quite dishonestly and it's ironic you talk about entitlement.", "What a stupid comparison", "*My comment is based on federal EEO laws in the U.S.*\n\nPeople on Reddit love to throw around \u201chostile work environment\u201d without really understanding EEO laws.  Sure, he could make the complaint, but that doesn\u2019t mean the employer has to care, because the OP doesn\u2019t have legal standing here to win a claim for hostile work environment.  \n\nBasically, on a legal level, icing him out over a no-dog policy is okay.  On the other hand, if he were to argue that his coworkers were bing hostile towards him because he\u2019s gay or black, and he can show the employer knew and didn\u2019t try to stop it, then he would have a potential legal claim.  \n\nSo, like it or not, legally his coworkers aren\u2019t doing anything wrong by not wanting to socialize with him because he vetoed the in-office dog policy.", "And the answer would be what?  You have to be friends at happy hour?  What does that look like?  Is there an amount of conversation that must be had?\n\nAgain, these people need to be professional with OP at work.  anything else is kind of fair game.  He doesn't have to go to happy hour if he doesnt' enjoy it based on how people act towards him", "I work for a fortune 500 company that is famously \"dog friendly\" but the rules are very strict, for example:\n\n* All dogs must be registered beforehand (they actually have to wear dog tag size replicas of the employee id badges, its adorable). Presumably they ask about vaccinations and such\n\n* employee can only bring one dog, one day per week\n\n* No barking, ever. Dog barks, dog goes home.\n\n* Dogs have to ride the freight elevator, not the regular elevators\n\n* No dogs in cafeteria or break areas\n\n* No dogs in conference rooms\n\n* Before you bring your dog to work the first time, you have to give a weeks notice to everyone who works on your floor. If anyone objects for any reason, you can't bring your dog. (People can object anonymously)\n\nThere are other rules I don't remember. Obviously service dogs have exceptions to some rules, but in general people always take priority over dogs. If OP worked for my company there would be no question, they would not have to work near a dog.", "I was using the term loosely, as in unbearable for the person, rather than in the legal sense.", "Well i feel sorry for everyone who does like them. so what now", "Love it", "I may not have worded that in the best way.  OP is entitled to not want the status quo to change.  But *his* entitled attitude comes into play because he is upset that his coworkers are upset.  We can ask for things and set boundaries, but we can't demand that other people are happy about it, or even continue to be friendly.", "Huh?  Yes, you can absolutely take an opportunity from someone, or in this case, a group of people.  There's nothing \"astonishing\" about that, and there's certainly nothing astonishing about the backlash OP has received over this.  Based on your reasoning, workplace policies should never, ever change to accommodate the changing wants/needs of the majority, but that is not how a lot of workplaces are run.", "Is it?  Our interns are far more annoying than dogs", "That's a fair point", "Now those are sensible rules. A dog-friendly Friday once a month, with one dog per person, might be worth a trial period. OP describes what would be a free-for-all.", ">Is it?  Our interns are far more annoying than dogs\n\nIt is."]}
