I think it's reasonable for you and your colleagues to want to ensure a safe and comfortable working environment, and if that means not having dogs, that's probably the best decision for the office as a whole. On the other hand, I feel for the person who was really looking forward to bringing their pup to work.", ">Everyday?\n\nI don't know the specifics or frequency to answer that.  I just new that I wanted to nip it in the bud.", "Me too!  Like it or not, work is largely about playing the social game.  OP took something (really, really) important away from several people, and then is confused when they don\u2019t want to play nicely \ud83e\udd14. It\u2019s a bit of an entitled attitude, and it shows a lack of empathy towards the coworkers.", "I don't think it was a threat, it was just a statement of fact that if dogs were welcome, he would no longer want to work there.", "I imagine that if OP hadn't spoken up, and the dogs came to work and OP quit because they found it intolerable the boss would say \"why didn't you say it was a problem?\" \nI guess the issue is did OP make a threat to get what they wanted, or were they absolutely sincere. I took it as sincere.", "Would the finance folks and upper management willingly take on the tremendous liability coverage that this would require? When someone's less-socialized dog chomps another dog, or a human? Good lord this is stupid. This sounds like some middle manager who thinks it will be good for \"bonding\" and a \"fun\" environment. Imagine you're in a meeting and one of your three dogs needs a walk. You have to take the one out, and...what do you do with the other two? Take a half-hour stroll around the neighborhood while everyone else waits for the meeting to continue? This is crazypants.", "Especially in a smaller workplace like this, where they likely don't have a dedicated HR dept that is used to how to deal with stuff like this.", "Honestly think management fucked this one up. They should have sought input anonymously. Now everyone knows where everyone stands and everyone knows who's the dude that ruined the nice thing for them. Sucks to be OP, because I certainly would not have the balls to tell my coworkers I do not care what they want, even if I hated them.", "Yeah, maybe. That\u2019s just how I read it.", "I feel it may have been better to bring up in private then. OP knew his stance was very unpopular but then went the extra step and said he would quit in front of all his coworkers. It was naive at best to think this would turn out well for him either way.", "Yeah, they could totally have been sincere, in which case I\u2019m happy to be wrong.", "Yah, not the best move by management if they wanted to keep things tight and neat, but that just further tells me what kind of work environment this is, and it seems like OP might not be the best fit."]}
