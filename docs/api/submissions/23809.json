We concluded that participants are, in general and in principle, favorable to the presence of dogs in organizations. Our informants mentioned the positive impact on social cohesion, a feeling of community, and an increase of the information exchange. We showed that pet-friendly policies may be positive, but also that they are not always positive, revealing boundary conditions for organizational pet policies.

Further research should investigate what the extent of the consequences are for employees and the company if the culture and the management are not ready for dogs at the office. In addition, while the study showed that dogs enhance the social capital of a company, the degree of job satisfaction and performance is still underexplored.

Until I start getting emails close to the deadline saying that they know that I didn\u2019t fill it out.\n\nSo\u2026not anonymous then?", " The first place I worked in my career definitely would have pulled something like this.", "I got asked to a focus group about discrimination against women in the workplace. It was with my direct management and the managers of the people who had been making my life hell. Trying to tell vague stories only led to being asked for names in a group setting. Managers can be hella dumb.", "Lots of them", "Haha like ... most of them", "Doesn't really matter if your employer knows it's you. As long as your colleagues are not made aware of it so they can't retaliate against you.\n\nAlso, no, if they use a google form and they make it anonymous, they won't know who wrote what.", "In this case as long as the coworkers don't find out it doesn't matter.", "Nobody cares about your cherry picked studies that you dont link to.  That appeal to \"authority\" is a waste of everyone's time.  Seriously, that carries zero persuasive weight.", "I just wouldn\u2019t trust a small, collaborative office like this to do the due diligence to keep it anonymous.", "A lot of units in hospitals will have meetings like this and generally it seems like they said they would probably move forward and OP panicked so he or she opened their mouth.", "OP didn't explain her reasoning.", "I'm so sorry!! \n\nBut yeah, that sort of thing is exactly why dogs don't need to be in a workplace.", "How are those two comparable?", "I have very bad anxiety around one specific breed after a series of bad experiences with that breed. And I understand that I can\u2019t stop other people from having that breed, but I can opt to remove myself from that situation. I know these were bad owners, but every experience with this breed was awful before the age of 10. At first it made me afraid of all dogs, then just big dogs, and I\u2019m still working on it but I still get serious anxiety around this dog. I would without a doubt quit the moment one of these popular dogs showed up.", "The employee badges on the collars is the cutest thing I have ever heard in my life.", "I have a feeling your anxiety breed is a common breed that many people have anxiety about (including myself) -- but just for the absurdity, I'm picturing a dopey Golden Retriever or Labradoodle instead.", "No OP says he has no idea but wanted to stop it right away", "I mean their good dogs actually. These were like really bad owners. Plus me already being scared did not help because the dog picked up on it.", "OP\u2019s coworkers were very interested in saving a lot of money on boarding/dogsitting. They wouldn\u2019t save much with strict rules and very limited dog visits.", "That totally isn't the same and yes, that is why the same rules do not apply.\n\nLike, wtf?", "YTA - you can\u2019t force everyone to bend to your will.", "Yeah I love dogs and hate women", "NTA. Dogs dont belong in the office. Fucking dog people.", "Yta go work one of the million places that aren\u2019t dog friendly. Don\u2019t ruin a good thing.", "NTA either everyone is in it or not. I have a \ud83e\udd9c I have to pay a sitter to parrot \ud83e\udd9c air when I\u2019m at work. Would I be able to take my \ud83e\udd9c? No, then NO \ud83d\udc15!!!", "Boarding for dogs? Like you leave your dog somewhere, go to work and then pick the dog up? Like a school or daycare? Is this a thing?", "I feel like I read this before\u2026", "NTA  I\u2019m shocked a company would implement a dog friendly work place after just \u2018some feedback\u2019.  I like dogs but I don\u2019t want dogs in my office every week .  When you voice an opinion should you expect some people will disagree.  I think an email to HR would have been more appropriate.", "NTA. So your co-workers want to bring in their pets in order to save money by taking them on walks themselves during work hours instead of working? Folks with kids should be able to bring in their kids to save money on childcare.", "NTA about the dog portion, but info: why is collaboration needed in person so much at your job? What are the downsides to collaborating remotely", "NTA, I am a dog person, we have a dog, I don't want to go to the office with  bunch of other dogs who may be furry, dirty, smelly and badly behaved.\n\nWhat if someone was allergic?", "Yeah, I worked in a dog-friendly office. Great fun until one of the mutts took a giant dump in the main hallway over the weekend, owner didn\u2019t notice, and NOBODY fessed up on Monday. Boss ended the fun immediately.", "NTA \n\nNot guaranteed but The people giving you shit about saving money on dog walkers are exactly the people likely to abuse the policy and let their shitty dogs run around bothering everyone way too often.\n\nI worked in an engineering office that had warehouse workshop.  It was more dog \u201ctolerant\u201d than friendly.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, everyone was friendly about it but the (dog)owners knew to keep the dogs under control and they were well behaved.  And the dogs weren\u2019t there most days.  People were there to work.\n\nThat\u2019s all to say it could easily be abused by entitled people, and there are people like yourself that don\u2019t like dogs, so why should they have to put up with it in the workplace.", "Dog friendly sounds like a terrible idea since you never know who is going to bring in poorly socialised dogs and could potentially result in a dangerous situation for other dogs and the people in the office.\nI LOVE dogs to distraction, but humans are garbage and a lot of them have dogs, especially since the pandemic. People aren't socialising or training their dogs and they're suffering because of it. Good on you for being the voice of reason.\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA, and I can think of very few businesses where dogs would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. It might be nice for a few pet owners, but many people don't want to work with dogs. Not liking dogs is not a moral failing.", "NTA", "I agree with you.  Dogs DO NOT belong in the office.  People are allergic, people are afraid, and it's unprofessional.  Some dogs may interact badly with  other dogs and some may bark and cause trouble.  And what about people with no dogs?  Can they bring their kid in?", "NTA. I don't particularly like dogs either and would have done the same. I like dog people even less, because they react like this to someone having a simple preference. As far as it saving the money, they chose to become a pet owner, if they didn't understand the cost that's on them.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a full on dog kinda guy. As I do dog and cat sit for my friends and when they had me over after a surgery I had one dog and two cats on me. If I had to choose cat or dog in the office I would prefer a couple office cats.  But that\u2019s me. On a side note every vet office I\u2019ve been to has always had an office cat.", "This exact post was already posted not that long ago. Why the repost?", "why in the world would this even be a thing. you are NTA, sorry you are being ostracized for it. it\u2019s a hill i would die on as well.", "NTA What about people with allergies? Some people literally can't breath around dogs.", "NTA. I have 4 dogs that I'm obsessed with and love dearly but let's be honest...dogs are disgusting. They bite. They tear stuff up. They smell. Etc. Insee why you'd want to keep them out if an office environment.", "No, Dennis Reynolds, you are not the asshole in this case. I would hate a dog friendly office and I generally like dogs.\n\nPlus it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Everyone thinks their dog is a perfect angel but how many people do you know that have crazy misbehaving dogs and they just laugh it off as their dog causes chaos and and destruction?", "YTA.", "NTA. Dogs do not belong in an office. It's not what's best for the company, the employees, or the dogs.", "I love dogs, would love to have them in the office ... NTA. This is something that will only work if everyone is at least feeling neutral-positive about it. A friend's company used to have a dog-friendly office, but since the company has grown and become more in-office that has progressively faded away. People feel nostalgic about it, but mostly understand that some quirks and foibles can't be generalized across the corporate workplace.", "NTA - A lot of people have no clue how to raise their dogs. They get in your space and it feels mean to reject them. They pee and poo sometimes everywhere. They sometimes bite. Many people are extremely allergic to them. \n\nA good dog is a blessing but there is no guarantee that every one of these people is actually a good dog owner. \n\nI would never dare to ask to bring my cats to work. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nE: typing", "NTA  \nAs a counterpoint - tell them that you may recinsider your position if they also make it spider and snake friendly - since you'd feel about as comfortable around dogs as most people do around snakes and spiders.", "Esh. I used to work for a place that did medical research (like building respirators, blood pressure cuffs, etc for mice, rabbits. Nothing harmful or anything to the animals). Afterwards, we kept them as on site pets. Even the mice/rats. My boss would bring her dog. We had 3 on site cats & a bunny named Stew. They implemented a rule where you could bring your pet but you were responsible. They were not allowed to roam. It wasnt bad, if someone had an issue w someone's pet, they would go above and beyond to make sure it was kenneled or leashed if you needed to enter (or if they knew ahead of time, they would leave at home). They were more than happy to oblige because if they didnt, it would end. My experience was pleasant,  i didn't think it would be. But i could see how a dog bite or a dog fight could end the company if its small enough (the company, not the issue lol). If they do decide to go through w it anyway, they may want to add that into their policy if possible because it opens them up to liability.", "Last place I worked before I retired, this one woman was always wanting to bring in her 3 pitbulls.  She was really a goofy person.  Looked, dressed and acted like a 12 year old boy.  Including harassing me constantly.  Would make up lies that I think were her delusions.  It was never allowed , thank god. It just seems like, to me, an overall bad idea.  The chances of having multiple dogs in an office work out well, is very slim.", "also allergies. people got allergies.", "I thought the same thing!", ">unbelievable\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen this same story here before, too, so at best it\u2019s a repost bot.", "Honestly this is on the low end of the bad management scale. It Can Always Get Worse.", "I reported a coworker for shoving a disabled client and not only did my supervisor do nothing but send the coworker through training again, but they informed the coworker that I reported them. When I complained (after this coworker threatened me with violence) they told me that the coworker \u201chad the right to face his accuser\u201d.  So yeah, this is completely fucking plausible.", "So OP should have lied and said he was fine with it when he wasn't?", "I think management sided with him because he brought up some major points they hadn't thought of. Dogs are not in any way a necessity for most businesses. And you have multiple dogs? Yes, it sounds like you should find a WFH job if leaving them is so difficult.", "OPs office isn\u2019t a barn \ud83d\ude11", "Our office was dog-friendly for a while. It was horrible. All the lower-ranking employees ended up with dog babysitter as an unlisted new job duty. And all you need is one untrained dog to pee somewhere then every dog is peeing on that same spot over and over. Our building reeked of dog pee until the policy was reversed. And not even mentioning the wads of dog hair everywhere.", "It has always confused me that my workplace is strictly scent free per HR guidelines despite no one having allergies to fragrance in our office but we are allowed to bring dogs (and I even brought my kitten when he was tiny)", "Right, just because the owners want their dogs there doesn't mean the dogs themselves won't get anxious. Dog fights are also a potential issue.", "I agree these rules are sensible.  My dog disagrees vehemently especially about not being allowed in the cafeteria and he would much rather stay home."]}
