She can ask for a +1 and bring someone along, or she can stay at the resort where she knows people and not take the extra week. She can share an airbnb with another friend who comes for the week but not the wedding. She can join a tour group after the wedding. She has so many options that aren't intruding on your plans with your family.", "You're NTA.

The destination wedding is a part of this vacation that you both happen to be attending, but she's not a member of your family and therefore not invited on a family vacation. I'm so sorry to hear she's making you feel guilty!", "NTA. She can't expect to just invade your family time. Baby comes first and you don't want her in the way.", "NTA. The last thing I would want to do is have a friend who would complain about my child nonstop stay and travel with me.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA.  And she has more options other than staying with you OR staying at the resort.  She could also book a hotel near the resort.", "NTA.\n\nYou prioritize your baby and she clearly isn\u2018t someone who should be around your baby too much. She caused the issue, and you solved it.

Do your own thing.", "You\u2019re already bringing one baby you don\u2019t need another tagging along", "NTA.

You are not her carer or her travel agent, and you are not responsible for her.", "NTA it is a family vacation. \n\nI also have a 2 year old and it is hard to travel with them: food, time zone, noise, different people, language\u2026 a whole new environment that can make a toddler fussy as H.

Let her know that her expectations wouldn\u2019t be met if she got stuck in a nap/meal/sleep schedule and both you and your husband will not leave the baby behind to accompany her to places and activities because you have a deal and expect to be together for the whole vacation. Also reinforce that she can either stay at the resort or rent an AirBnB near by, but sharing a house won\u2019t be possible since your husband and you want to be comfortable enough to run around butt naked to catch a 2-year-old covered in sand that doesn\u2019t want to get in the shower\u2026 tell her that in the end it\u2019s all about privacy and making sure that everyone is having a good time\u2026", "NTA\n\nDo not allow this to happen!

Don\u2019t let her get away with it please.\n\nShe is not your responsibility. You are not responsible for making her travel comfortable.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you don't want to divide your attention between your friend and your child, especially when you are traveling to a new country and have to consider your child's needs. You have to put your child's needs first and make sure that you are able to take care of him properly. It's completely reasonable for you to want to do your own thing, especially if you feel that your friend may not be the most supportive or understanding when it comes to your child's needs.  \nThat being said, it's important to communicate with your friend and try to find a solution that works for both of you. Perhaps you could suggest alternative arrangements, such as booking a separate room or Airbnb for your friend to stay in, or offering to help her plan her own activities while you focus on your child. It may also be helpful to explain to your friend why you made the decision that you did, and reassure her that you value her friendship and want to spend time with her, but that you also need to prioritize your child's needs.  \nUltimately, it's up to you and your husband to decide what's best for your family, but it's important to try to find a solution that works for everyone and to communicate openly and honestly with your friend. It's possible that she may still be upset, but with time and understanding, it's likely that your friendship will be able to recover.", "I had a similar situation but with my brother and his girlfriend. We shared a house once it was awful! My husband and I had to deal with my 1,5-year-old at the time and it wasn\u2019t compatible with my brother\u2019s expectations whatsoever. \n\nMy brother would complain about the noise at 5:30/6am (babies wake up early), and that he could not put music and drink at 8pm because the baby was sleeping. He complained about my son\u2019s crying, for him not being able to make noise at night when arriving from a bar\u2026 we just agreed to never do it again because we both argued about things all the time\u2026 he wanted to go to a beach that wasn\u2019t child friendly while we had to go to a calmer one so we could swim with a baby, we had to chose a nice restaurant that would have a healthy menu instead of that nice place with music and drinks that would serve only appetizers\u2026 single/childless people don\u2019t know what it takes to be a parent, all the \u201csacrifices\u201d we have to make to accommodate our kids, also they should not have to make those accommodations for other people kids correct? You are right, in order for your friendship survive it is better for you do your own things\u2026", "Why is it important to try to find a solution that works for everyone?  OP is all set with her plans.  Is their friendship worth the time and energy it would take OP to resolve the issue?  This is not her problem, and spending time finding an airbnb and planning her friend's activities is silly.", "Awful comment. \n\nOP isn\u2019t in college anymore and has a husband and child. The times have changed the situation has changed. \n\nShe has absolutely no obligation to \u2018find a solution that works for both\u2019 of them.", "What?  The friend invited herself to their particular plans of a third party friend they share that is getting married.  Sorry, but other than communicating what she said which was no and why, no real friendship requires that OP (who didn't invite her) now try to compromise or spend her energy finding the friend (an adult) a solution that makes her happy."]}
