Don\u2019t let her get away with it please.\n\nShe is not your responsibility. You are not responsible for making her travel comfortable.", "NTA. It's completely understandable that you don't want to divide your attention between your friend and your child, especially when you are traveling to a new country and have to consider your child's needs. You have to put your child's needs first and make sure that you are able to take care of him properly. It's completely reasonable for you to want to do your own thing, especially if you feel that your friend may not be the most supportive or understanding when it comes to your child's needs.  \nThat being said, it's important to communicate with your friend and try to find a solution that works for both of you. Perhaps you could suggest alternative arrangements, such as booking a separate room or Airbnb for your friend to stay in, or offering to help her plan her own activities while you focus on your child. It may also be helpful to explain to your friend why you made the decision that you did, and reassure her that you value her friendship and want to spend time with her, but that you also need to prioritize your child's needs.  \nUltimately, it's up to you and your husband to decide what's best for your family, but it's important to try to find a solution that works for everyone and to communicate openly and honestly with your friend. It's possible that she may still be upset, but with time and understanding, it's likely that your friendship will be able to recover.", "I had a similar situation but with my brother and his girlfriend. We shared a house once it was awful! My husband and I had to deal with my 1,5-year-old at the time and it wasn\u2019t compatible with my brother\u2019s expectations whatsoever. \n\nMy brother would complain about the noise at 5:30/6am (babies wake up early), and that he could not put music and drink at 8pm because the baby was sleeping. He complained about my son\u2019s crying, for him not being able to make noise at night when arriving from a bar\u2026 we just agreed to never do it again because we both argued about things all the time\u2026 he wanted to go to a beach that wasn\u2019t child friendly while we had to go to a calmer one so we could swim with a baby, we had to chose a nice restaurant that would have a healthy menu instead of that nice place with music and drinks that would serve only appetizers\u2026 single/childless people don\u2019t know what it takes to be a parent, all the \u201csacrifices\u201d we have to make to accommodate our kids, also they should not have to make those accommodations for other people kids correct? You are right, in order for your friendship survive it is better for you do your own things\u2026", "Why is it important to try to find a solution that works for everyone?  OP is all set with her plans.  Is their friendship worth the time and energy it would take OP to resolve the issue?  This is not her problem, and spending time finding an airbnb and planning her friend's activities is silly.", "Awful comment. \n\nOP isn\u2019t in college anymore and has a husband and child. The times have changed the situation has changed. \n\nShe has absolutely no obligation to \u2018find a solution that works for both\u2019 of them.", "What?  The friend invited herself to their particular plans of a third party friend they share that is getting married.  Sorry, but other than communicating what she said which was no and why, no real friendship requires that OP (who didn't invite her) now try to compromise or spend her energy finding the friend (an adult) a solution that makes her happy.", "NTA, she's offended because she wanted to make her vacation cheaper, and have you and your husband play tour guide. Given that she keeps coming back to feeling uncomfortable traveling alone, she's already telling you that she's viewing you and your husband as her tour guides.\n\nI truly don't get why you feel guilty about not wanting someone who would lose their temper on your baby in your intimate space. Why do you feel bad about not dealing with someone who would actively be mean to your baby? And who also entirely wants to stay with you to take advantage of your time and give herself a discount? None of the plan is to your benefit because the cost you'd be saving in the $400 would come back to bite you and having someone be mean to your baby and take advantage of your time", "NTA", "Seriously, and someone who also has made it clear that you would need to be there tour guide. Her saying she's uncomfortable traveling alone he's saying that she would be latching onto your trip to turn you and your husband into tour guides", "She should ask the couple if they\u2019re other single women who might like to share a room. \n\nHonestly, I would consider to help with organizing transportation to the wedding if she gets her own Airbnb near you but she shouldn\u2019t expect to come with on day trips or stay in your room. It\u2019s one thing to share ideas so she can go to the same cultural sites on different days and info about logistics. But she should be executing these ideas on her own and not relying on you during the trip", "NTA\n\n>She got offended and said she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable traveling alone especially in a new country and with her previous health issues. \n\nTell her you don't feel comfortable planning a family holiday with your husband and child, especially a week long one, only to have a friend try and insert themselves into it.", "NTA - and I can't believe that you think Abby is your friend.\n\nWhat type of friend invites herself into her friend's *family* plans *and* says that their small child is annoying but the family really ought to let her come with them anyway, because **she** will save money and **she** doesn't want to travel alone. Also they ought to change their plans in the new country to suit ***her***. WTF?\n\nIt's going to be an exciting vacation but challenging with such a small child and wedding requirements. I have no idea why Abby thinks she's entitled to turn you into a bonus mum and carer on this trip because it will suit ***her***.  Say no and mean it.", "NTA, I have a baby and wouldn't want to bunk with a friend like that.\n\nWhat kind of accommodations is she looking at? When I was there I stayed at hostels for $5-$15 a night", "NTA. Hold firm or you will be babysitting her every day if the trip.", "While she is only seeing this from her point of view, and is failing to understand that you have a young child who is now your priority.  When single & no kids it is different, but your life has changed.  And so has hers, while it is no ones fault that she isn't as independent as before.  She can't rely upon you to be her caretaker.\n\nShe may not be able to go and her new reality is taking some getting used too.  And she should ask a sibling or parent to go with her instead.\n\nBe honest and say those years of traveling together is no longer possible.  You now have a travel partner aka hubby.  \n\nNTA\n\nAnd destination weddings mean not everyone will be able to go and the couple in question should have taken other's disabilities and finances into consideration before sending out the invites.", "NTA she is not your responsibility tell her I\u2019m sorry maybe she can bring someone but you are a family and prefer privacy.", "NTA. You have enough on you plate traveling and taking care of one baby let alone two.", "Nta. You aren't her babysitter.", "Her friend sounds like a teenager. Wouldn\u2019t want to have two kids to watch on this trip\u2026", "OP, please tell your friend that there are English-speaking tour groups she can research\u2014there are a TON in a popular destination like Thailand. They are often day trips so she won\u2019t be traveling too far if she\u2019s paranoid, but she\u2019ll still be with a group of people who also don\u2019t want to travel alone. If she can compromise with you by taking care of her solo plans during the day (and show you confirmation emails) then maybe it could help her with the costs of paying for those tours by saving her money and letting her crash in your Airbnb. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You have your family with you, it's logical you don't want another adult in there too.  Her not tolerating babies well is fine but then she shouldn't expect to room with one.", "NTA do what\u2019s best for you and your family. She\u2019s an adult and can make her own plans just like she does on a daily basis and doesn\u2019t need you to fix her daily life for her. Relationships change as we get older and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It could not stay the same as it was when you were in college. You are no longer each other\u2019s plus one, you have a family in that place. Taking time to enjoy a holiday as a family unit is important. Navigating baby will be enough alone without a high maintenance friend you weren\u2019t expecting to want to stay with you and your husband. I think you should say no to anyone that wants to join in, they should\u2019ve planned their journey/trip better. Just because you and your husband made suitable plans for your family doesn\u2019t mean others get to take advantage of it. Plus how many breaks do you get to take together like this to make these special memories.\n\nShe\u2019s only looking to infringe because it\u2019ll save her money and to make you and your husband responsible for her food, travel, entertainment etc\u2026 \n\nShe can and should get a room in the hotel that\u2019ll cater to all her needs and cut down on her travelling especially if she\u2019s feeling insecure to travel in that areas. There will be people at the hotel attending the same wedding and activities. She can also ask the bride for someone to share room and spilt costs of the room that\u2019s also single if she wants. If she chooses not to go then it\u2019s on her not you.\nDon\u2019t feel guilty or back down, putting your family first is not a bad thing. At no point should you feel like someone is completing with your child for your attention.  My closet friend has a child and we\u2019re both focused on my godson and his needs. Yes we have allocated adult time but those cheeks and big eyes gets me every time, he comes first for both of us", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is you with your family in a room, including a child will be a major stress factor.\n\nSo don't do it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She got offended and said she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable traveling alone\" .. Not YOUR fault. So she can travel with someone else,, or not go. YOU do not need a second baby to babysit.", "NTA\n\nIf you would have agreed, her next move would be to insist you leave the baby at home, LOL!", "NTA! Her attempt to invite herself into your space and activities was declined, and she was offended? She's not 12yo. You are not her personal tour guide. You have definitely done the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYour family deserves to have a stress free trip, and so does your friend. I\u2019m sure she can find a small Airbnb for around her price point. But if she gets annoyed that easily by your baby, I don\u2019t think she understands she\u2019s not going to enjoy being around him for an entire week.", "Why in the world is this solution for her friend inviting herself to their family vacation to find a solution that works for the person who invited herself. Said person is a grown up and can find her own solution and leave OP and OP's family to their own vacation.", "I had a friend do this (minus a child involved!) and it was awful - to the point that I went NC once we got back.  Enjoy Thailand with your family, it\u2019s a wonderful country."]}
