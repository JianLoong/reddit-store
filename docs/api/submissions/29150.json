This will trigger a cps case and they will be investigated. It\u2019s not an abuse of 911 as you are a victim of educational and emotional neglect.", "Do you have any respect for what me and my sister are going through? I would never make something like this up. This is a serious issue and it took alot of courage for me to speak up about it. Contortion is a genuine passion for me and my sister and we have been training for years. I never planned on joining the circus but right now it seems like the best career option considering the educational neglect we are facing.", "All that very sadly makes sense. Hopefully op WILL go to an adult and get help with this", "Well, probably not reddit. But I get your meaning.\n\nWhen I was small they'd tell us to go to any trusted adult and I repeat that, but I do remember being 14 and thinking yeah, right.  That's an oxymoron.\n\nLibrarians maybe.\nThey're like superheroes.\n\nDoctors, police maybe, teachers usually, neighbors sometimes. \n\nAs an aunt, I've often wished I'd made it more clear to the kids in my life how welcome they would have been when they needed a safe place.", "If they don't have internet.... I'm not sure how they'd go about posting their story on reddit.", "We're not talking specifically about OP. We're talking about homeschooled children generally.\n\nMany people who homeschool do it as a way to isolate their children. They don't take them to libraries. They don't take them to the doctor. They don't send them to school (see: homeschool). They often don't have neighbours. They're often either isolated from their extended families with no way to contact them or they're in the same religion/cult/mindset.\n\nThere are no trusted adults."]}
