He can get some weed barrier plastic and fill in under them with rocks or mulch to prevent the weeds but also make it look nice.", "NTA - why should you be responsible for the weeds happening in their yard?  And why should this cost you damage to your fence?  The answer should be absolutely not.  You can offer for them to come into your yard once a week to hand pull their weeds from their side of the fence.", "NTA\n\nThey should have paid someone to install a mow strip before they added those planters. They could still get someone to remove their planters, add the strip, and then put the planters back. Of course, with their own money, though. It's their problem to deal with.", "Nope, nope, nope\u2026they can figure out way to hand trim their lawn, including moving their garden. Absolutely no to cutting your fence. What an asinine thing to even ask!", "NTA His lack of foresight in installing the raised garden beds caused the issue. He needs to move them to allow enough space to weed wack the area between them an your fence. Not your problem. If he won't do it, install some shrubs so you don't need to see his weeds.", "NTA. He created the problem.  Why should you damage your property to save his?", "Nta- you said you pulled the weeds once already. just tell him what kind of beer you like and if he get a case of it you two can drink it and pull the weeds. Let him know pulling weeds by hand is part of having a raised garden. Even if the weeds are outside of it the roots will still steal nutrients from the garden plants. \n\nIf you want to be petty put up a wood fence", "NTA. \nThey can pay to have it modified so they can take care of the maintenance easily themselves. Whoever installed it can be called back.", "NTA. And I would also wonder if their planters are sitting on top of a utility easement of some kind (water, cable, electric, telephone) and/or if your HOA has a rule about minimum setbacks from a fenceline.", "NTA - Working with them does not mean you have to accept the only unacceptable option they've given you. Another option is one of them being in your back yard for an hour or two pulling the weeds through the fence - not letting them do this if there isn't a good reason would mak yo T A. Ask them to think \"outside the box\" to come up with some other ideas that won't cost you money - maybe they can think of something else that would be acceptable.", "Are there any neighborhood kids? Tell em to hire one with skinny arms to pull weeds. I paid some neighborhood kids to pick rocks last year. Everyone wins. Kids love money. I love not picking rocks.

This guy sounds like one of those of give an inch will take a mile.", "NTA", "NTA\u2212All I can think they can do now is to put rocks down and burn the weeds with propane torch. It's actually kind of fun. But don't do it directly at chain link fence, it will rust.", "NTA. The request was weird as that would render the fence useless and also make it look extremely stupid.

You're right that it's not your responsibility to fix, and it was his lack of foresight which seems like an honest mistake, but I'd consider how probable it is that he's going to solve this problem in a way that you won't find satisfactory (like the herbicide) if you don't work together. Just saying.", "YTA their planters are just as valid as your fence. Is this really the relationship you want with your neighbors?
