I'm divorced (have been for a few years now) and my ex remarried recently. \n\nHer new husband (Jonathan) is black (we're white). He and my ex are now expecting a baby together. He also has 2 teenage boys himself. \n\nMy ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. \n\nLast weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but \"no video games today\" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. \n\nMy ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to \" f*ck off\". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied \"you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway\". \n\nI asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because \"well isnt it true\"). \n\nI lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. \n\nHe said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1669998153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaqd83/aita_for_grounding_my_16yro_son_for_a_month_after/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Racists are dangerous and whether he truly thinks he\u2019s better than black people or he thinks it\u2019s acceptable to hurt people that way there\u2019s something in him that needs to change that\u2019s deeper than his use of a word. Ive seen kids get longer time for calling their mom a b*tch and this is inherently worse. What did your husband say? Being black as well I would definitely have thoughts on how to handle this.", "NTA, you're a great parent and person and I applaud you for co-parenting this way. You rock!", "What exactly did your son fall out with this guy for?", "NTA that\u2019s good parenting. It\u2019s a punishment that the boy clearly needs. And he is a boy if he thinks he can say that without repercussions and you should tell him that.

What your son said is despicable. You have done the right thing.", "Good job for grounding. Maybe some community service in a poor black neighborhood is in order as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That is disgusting behaviour and he needs a lot of education on the origins and meaning of that word. Please don\u2019t overlook this aspect when dealing with this.", "Wow.  NTA.  First, sounds like you, ex, and stepdad parent well together.  That's really refreshing.  Second, grounded for a month full of fun activities is appropriate.  Third, your son needs to get an education on racism and why we don't use that word.  If all that happens is the grounding, that won't help him really get why that word is awful, and especially since he now has family that is black, he NEEDS to open his mind to their experience.  Please teach him.", "NTA. Good for you for coming down hard on your son's racism.", "I was gonna say YTA by the title but man, that is so f\u2019ed up. \n\nYeah ok, ground him for a month but that is the least of your concerns, you should find a way to go deeper into why he chose to respond that way.\n\nEdit: NTA", "The fact that your Mom and brother think the \u201cpunishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d shows exactly where he learned that despicable behavior.

Is your family racist?", "You're NTA!", "NTA - that \u201cone word\u201d can get you arrested, fired, assaulted and even killed\n\nIt\u2019s not just a word \n\nAlso cut down time between your son and your brother and mother, the fact they don\u2019t see an issue makes me wonder if they perhaps influence  him, even if not, he doesn\u2019t need to be around people who support his use do the word", "NTA but you and his mom both need to seek out resources to counter his racism.  Punishment alone won't help with that and may even make this problem worse unless there's also work done to get at the root of the problem.\n\n Checking out the work of Jane Elliot is one good starting point. The Learning for Justice website also has some good resources. \n\nI am reluctant to say Jonathan should be part of this process because the emotional labor involved in countering racism is not something he should have to do in his own home but I am sure he has some suggestions &, for all I know,  would be more than willing to dive in on educating the kid on the issue. \n\nThank you for taking it seriously.", "NTA\nYou definitely have to have a real sit-down talk with him about racism and prejudice.

But yeah, he should be punished for using a slur.", "NTA - I think his punishment should also include some education on the subject.  He needs to learn there are consequences for his actions, even free speech.", "NTA. The n word is seriously sensitive and your son used it in a very insulting manner. It does deserve a serious punishment and what\u2019s telling is that all 3 adults are in agreement. \n\nYou do need to sit down and have a talk with your son about racism and where these opinions have come from though. That\u2019s a deeper issue that needs addressing.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a just punishment for an offense that would be serious even if it wasn\u2019t directed at family members.

Your son has to realize he was not using just another curse word - but a hateful pejorative. And he did it knowingly and with intent to hurt.\n\nNTA, I applaud your parenting.", "NTA - good for you.  The actual issue aside, this shows great solidarity.  As far as \"overreacting\" goes - your son wasn't just being deliberately hateful to a stranger or casual acquaintance, but to 3 people who live in his actual home!", "NTA and this ladies and gents is how you parent after a divorce.  \n\nThere\u2019s clearly work to be done with your son but we\u2019ll done for standing up for the new step parent when your son is so so so clearly in the wrong.", "NTA! Your son needs to learn that certain things WILL NOT be tolerated.", "NTA- First off, nice to see such functional co-parenting. Well done!  A month doesn\u2019t seem long based on the offense- that has to be stamped out. As a punishment this seems reasonable. \n\nPlease work with a psychologist to make sure the punishment is also well-designed to change his behavior. Part of this is a particularly shitty form of acting out to changes in his life, and he needs to learn the right way to deal with this life stress", "NTA \n\nThank you for being a good parent, and a good coparent, and not putting up with this.", "You are absolutely right to punish your son this way.

Your mother and brother think that calling black people n* is okay? We now know who your son is getting this behavior from. You should be commended for taking this issue seriously and teaching your son that this is unacceptable.", "NTA. And have a feeling your mom and brother have a lean toward racism, at the very least. Thank you for teaching your son respect and how to treat other humans. It's ok to be upset at others, but never ok to insult their being. I'm sure his friends will be fine.", "babe grounding for the month is not enough. that\u2019s awful, you need to work on doing something that actually fixes the behavior. you\u2019re subjecting jonathan and his kids to living with a nasty racist. please raise your son.", "NTA, you know your Son and what punishment works and what doesn\u2019t work Id say he needs to see the boundaries here and know that you aren\u2019t an ally for a get out of Jail free card.   I think what you have worked up overall with your ex is very mature for the times and like to see couples working together to raise their child.", "NTA but make your son go to some sort of training abt why he shouldn't be using slurs. Use the whole month of December to teach him WHY he shouldn't be using slurs.\n\nSeriously, every single day, make him watch YT videos abt it, take him to a museum abt this history, make him meet with a therapist to explain why it's bad, etc. \n\nHe needs to be inundated with what he did and how hurtful it is to his stepfather and stepsiblings.\n\nYour son was a jerk and used racist language.

You can set boundaries around language. I so hope, that this will be an isolated incident for your child, but chances are it won't be. Good luck to you and your family. Stay strong in boundaries around punishment, and reaffirming communication skills throughout your whole family.", "NTA and let me congratulate you, his mom and stepdad for stepping up as an unit and teaching him manners and discipline. \n\nI't important he learns that actions and words have consequences. He will NEVER do this again if you guys hold his punishment all month.", "NTA - It's kind of concerning you had to ask.", "Nta. Thank you for being a parent! Your son will thank you in the future for stopping this behavior before it destroys his life.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Your exactly the kind of parent all kids should have.

Doesn't sound like he sees the error of his ways.", "Wow, NTA . That's bad by anyone's standards, really bad. You son needs to learn he can't resort to using slurs and demeaning language everytime things don't go his way or he gets in trouble. Say something like that to the wrong person and he can wind up in a world of hurt.", "NTA your son is lucky you\u2019re only grounding him for a month. He\u2019s probably acting out with all the changes in relationship dynamics with your ex and her new family but the way he did it is totally wrong.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally understandable that your son may have trouble adjusting to a blended family, but it\u2019s disappointing that he decided to use racism as a way to lash out. You can\u2019t let that slide. \n\nDo you know what the relationships with his stepbrothers are like? Are there bullying/exclusion issues that might be contributing to this outburst? \n\nYou might need to check on his online activity. The alt-right/white supremacy movement is actively trying to recruit younger white guys, and they are very effective at infiltrating gaming spaces.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure your ex and Jonathan appreciate this more than you know.\n\nIt is worth trying to figure out what kinds of online communities your son is spending time in, he is the perfect demographic to be recruited by alt right creeps. :/", "It is concerning your family is not taking what he did seriously.

You taking their side is so powerful.", "NTA! NTA! NTA!\n\n\nTotally appropriate and good for you!\n\nIf your mother and brother honestly believe this relatively minor punishment doesn\u2019t fit this particular crime, they\u2019re a terrible and enabling influence and should be kept away from your son. \n \nOne more time- NTA and good for you. The world doesn\u2019t need anymore racists.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t care how mad I\u2019ve been at somebody, using racial slurs has never ever crossed my mind.

Going out into the world he will eventually run into this idiocy and he needs to know that it is unacceptable. And now is when to learn that.", "NTA but I think you need to do more work than just ground him. \n\nYou need to talk to your son about why he would think that it\u2019s ever okay to use that word. About how it\u2019s so much more than \u201ca word\u201d. \n\nYou need to talk to him about why he feels that his blended family is ruining his life. \n\nYou need to help him understand how much he would have hurt SD\u2019s feelings and question why he thinks it\u2019s appropriate to attack him like that.

You\u2019re teaching early that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.", "NTA you should sit him down each day and show him examples of why it's such a bad word to use, especially in anger", "NTA actions have consequences. He used the worst word possible. You are co-parenting and doing a great job BTW.", "NTA he knew exactly what he was doing", "NTA\n\nBut where is your son picking up his ideology from?", "NTA. My hell...are your mother and brother the ones who taught him to spew that hateful garbage?!?!?! I have raised 3 boys (26-13) and they would be lucky to see the sun again if they said that to ANYONE. Good for you for taking this seriously and holding firm.\n\nYou should also seriously check into some therapy for your son...it is clear he is carrying resentment about the divorce and/or remarriage and if it manifests in this hatefulness he needs some help working it out also to help with the errors in his thinking. That he is confused about why it is bad to say (or think1) when it is \"true\" is a huge red flag that might take a professional to unwind and combat.", "NTA. Not even close. In fact, you would be a HUGE asshole if you let that slide in any way. Kid needs to learn what is and isn't acceptable. It seems like both you and your ex are firmly anti-N-word so I assume he gets that language either from his friend group or the internet communities he's in. Just beware, people usually don't just *say* the N word as an insult without having some underlying racism. So the lesson needs to be deeper than just \"don't say that word, it's not okay\".", "Are brother and mom where he learned it? NTA but you definitely need to have an in depth discussion about WHY that word is so bad as well.", "NTA but I think more needs to be done here in terms of discipline because he obviously doesn\u2019t understand the impact that word can have. There are organizations you could contact who have folks who share their experiences of racial discrimination with young people like your son. He needs to understand how that word makes people feel. It\u2019s not something you throw around because you can\u2019t play videos games. Also, it could ruin his life if said to the wrong person or captured on video. You\u2019ve under reacted with the punishment in my opinion.", "NTA. If anything he probably needs more discipline.", "NTA and sounds like he needs some serious therapy", "NTA *but* the punishment is incomplete.  I see a lot of comments saying it would be nice if some reeducation aspect were a part of his grounding.  I think education and amends NEED to be worked in.  For his development, safety and well-being, he NEEDS to be held accountable for his use of s racial slur.  The grounding is meaningless and will only make him more resentful of his step-family if this atrocious behavior goes unchecked.\n\nShame on your brother and mother for condoning this.  It would be good to send some pointed questions their way too.\n\nEdit to add:  Some ideas would be community work, documentaries, research projects, therapy, including him in discussions of how he should make amends before the arrival of his new brother.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA for grounding your son. Your son is racist and needs to be disciplined. If I was Jonathan I wouldn\u2019t want your son around me or my kids including the one that your ex-wife is currently pregnant with. Definitely need dig into his racism more before it gets worse and he does something that can\u2019t be taken back", "NTA - you need to shut that behavior down immediately!\n\nI'd say grounding isn't enough - might need to assign him some anti-racism reading or sign him up for a class. He needs an education along with the punishment.\n\nEdit: misspelled word", "NTA. This person will most likely be in your sons life for a long time and he\u2019ll have half siblings that are biracial. He needs to learn that using any racial slur is offensive, no matter who it\u2019s pointed towards.", "NTA. Sounds like solid parenting.", "NTA.\n\nTime to distance yourself from your racist mother and brother. Also, gather all his electronics and monitor his online activity, as it's quite possible he's being radicalized online.\n\nDo not take this lightly.", "NTA at all - it sounds like you, your ex, and your ex's new husband are wonderful co-parents - but I'm totally side-eying your mom and brother. Actually \"side-eying\" isn't quite accurate, right now my eyebrows are raised so high they're practically at my hairline. Seems like you need to do a lot of work with them, too, or keep them and their malignant influence away from your son.", "NTA. In all fairness, I'm (white) piss.ed that when black person says it, it's ok but when white person says it, it's called racist. BUT! This is not a racist stuff - it's about respect to family member, to your ex new husband. It's not just joking between friends, when people call each other all kind of things without malicious intent. He (your son) is old enough to know exactly what he was doing. NTA. Thanks for backing up your wife and respect person, she decided to have a family with.", "NTA. Your son's use of this slur is abhorrent and he needs to learn that now before someone decides to teach him that lesson with their fists. I'd also take the opportunity to try to get him to understand why such language can be so harmful to others, because it sure doesn't sound like he gets it now. \n\nAlso your brother and mom thinking you're overreacting amounts to tacit acceptance of abusive language and maybe you should have a talk with them about that. Otherwise how you discipline your child is none of their business.", "NTA, but it sounds like your son doesn't need to be around your mom and brother anymore, since they condone this racist behavior, and likely learned it from them. Your son's words hurt, and he needs to realize that. The punishment DEFINITELY fits the crime, and I wouldn't let it go", "NTA as long as you and your ex agree - the rest of the family can kick rocks", "NTA\nNTA\nNTA \nGreat job and I hope in addition to consequences for his actions, your son realizes the gravity of the words he used.", "NTA. That is not ok to say ever, let alone to a parental figure. I also think that the punishment the right one. It is harsh enough that he won\u2019t think about doing it again but not too abusive. I would tell your brother and mother to stay out of it as it is not their child.", "literally why would you be TA? obviously NTA", "NTA and I think you should consider the fact that your son isn\u2019t taking this seriously if he\u2019s \u201cannoyed\u201d by this punishment. I can\u2019t stress enough how problematic this is. \n\nAlso, a huge WTF is wrong with your brother and mother??!! Holy shit you have some problems there, too.", "NTA\n\noh the punishment fits the crime\n\nThis was decided by his parents. Grandma and uncles can be told, firmly, to butt out. \n\nThink about asking your son to do a book report over break. Like *White Fragility* or *How to be* *an Antiracist*. Maybe shave a week off if he does a good job.", "NTA. Totally fitting punishment. My biggest concern would be where he learned it was OK to ever say something like that. Which forums, gaming groups, friend circles is he part of that accepts that kind of hatred?", "NTA. In fact, I think a month is lenient. You need to nip this in the bud now.", "NTA in the least and your son owes a BIG apology to his step father and step siblings. He would also be on what I termed with my kids when they were teens Gilligan's Island.. no phone, no boat, no motor car, not a single luxury.....", "NTA your son needs to learn that racist bullshit should not be tolerated.", "NTA. A lot of these comments are immediately jumping to your son is a racist idk that I immediately jump to racist especially since he\u2019s 16 and more than likely goes to a high school. When I was 16 people in my school used the N word because they thought it was cool. Your son seems to be acting out because of all the change in close time frame- new step dad, two teenage step brothers and a new baby on the way. 16 year olds tend to be very narcissistic and don\u2019t like being told what to do especially by someone new. \n\nYour son needs to get in to see a therapist immediately, I also recommend a family therapist for you all to contact. \n\nEducate him on the meaning of the word and why it should never be used and why it is so derogatory and hurtful. \n\nHe needs to (genuinely) apologize to your wife\u2019s new husband, his sons and your wife.", "NTA. It needs to be a longer punishment.", "NTA and I among many others will thank you for taking a stand like that.", "NO SIR you\u2019re NTA at all . On top of the punishment he\u2019s been given may I suggest seeking some help to educate your son on how harmful that word is . Im a white woman with white children and I\u2019d hit the fucking roof flying if any of my children ever used that word , much less direct it at someone and then give that answer as a follow up as to why they said it . There\u2019s obvs a reason why he thought it was ok to say and that needs exploring and changed", "So your brother and mom are racist too?  Got it.  \n\nNTA.  You are trying to raise your son right.", "NTA and I think you were entirely correct. Hate speech is nothing to take lightly, and being permissive with your son over this would only encourage him to keep thinking and talking this way. He's 16, and that's old enough to know better; and if he kept doing this into his adulthood, he'd run into some real problems, really fast. \n\nIt's not \"one word\". I'd agree that this was overboard if you grounded him for a month for saying \"fuck\", for example. He'd have a fair point had he not used an actual racial slur. He could stand to learn a little bit about the history of that word, its use in slavery and lynchings, etc. -- he clearly doesn't understand the impact of that word. \n\nWhere did he learn to talk like this? Is this something he gets from his friends?", "NTA, but have you considered also talking to your son? That's some worrying comfort with a slur at 16. It might be worth trying to get ahead of this behavior to try and cut if off before if gets worse. \n\nAnd obviously he can stay grounded. That's so much time for him go learn", "Not only are you NTA, you are father of the year. You are teaching your son respect, and you are also doing a great job co-parenting.

But very concerning your mother and brother think it's OK.", "NTA. Your son was out of line. Shame on your racist family members for excusing this. Stick to the punishment", "NTA and the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. He should be punished more. Now if he says that crap in public or to Jonathan\u2019s son directly, his mouth might write a check his ass can\u2019t cash!!! This is disgusting and he needs harder consequences.

He\u2019s acting like a racist and entitled child!!!", "NTA... but please help him to understand why that was so hurtful or all he will get out of this is resentment.", "They agree with your son?!? NTA  Its not just a word.", "NTA\n\nGood on you! Your son is portraying really worrying qualities, good on you for giving proper punishment for his despicable racism. I'm curious, what do Your brother and mom think are proper punishments for overt racism and white supremacy beliefs, because your son is straight up expressing those ideals.", "Its not just the slur, it is the whole thing plus \"I don't have to listen to them anyway.\" \n\nGiving him a pass cos he has plans is BS, it would teach him nothing. Your parents and anyone who think a months grounding is OTT isn't winning any points either, they are racist, as is your son. I think given the context the punishment isn't really enough tbh, as I doubt he will learn anything from it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s a horrible word to use in any context if you are not Black. It\u2019s even worse that he directed it towards a family member.\n\nYour punishment fits the crime, OP. Your son deserves what he is getting, but I would strongly recommend that he also get some time in with people, who teach racial equity/justice/inclusion. Perhaps the whole family can go to address these issues and perhaps a family therapy session or two might be beneficial.", "NTA .... He uses that word in the wrong place in life and he could end up dead . That is besides the point , certain things have to be stamped out and racism in any shape or form at that age is alarming .

He also has 2 teenage boys himself. \n\nMy ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. \n\nLast weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but \"no video games today\" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. \n\nMy ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to \" f*ck off\". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied \"you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway\". \n\nI asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because \"well isnt it true\"). \n\nI lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. \n\nHe said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime. \n\nAita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he really thinks it is \"just a word\" then why would he use it in anger?  He owes Jonathan a sincere apology and a plan on how to demonstrate that he means it.
