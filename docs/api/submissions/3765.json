I'm divorced (have been for a few years now) and my ex remarried recently. \n\nHer new husband (Jonathan) is black (we're white). He and my ex are now expecting a baby together. He also has 2 teenage boys himself. \n\nMy ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. \n\nLast weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but \"no video games today\" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. \n\nMy ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to \" f*ck off\". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied \"you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway\". \n\nI asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because \"well isnt it true\"). \n\nI lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. \n\nHe said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1669998153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaqd83/aita_for_grounding_my_16yro_son_for_a_month_after/", "score": 20452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Racists are dangerous and whether he truly thinks he\u2019s better than black people or he thinks it\u2019s acceptable to hurt people that way there\u2019s something in him that needs to change that\u2019s deeper than his use of a word. Ive seen kids get longer time for calling their mom a b*tch and this is inherently worse. What did your husband say? Being black as well I would definitely have thoughts on how to handle this.", "NTA, you're a great parent and person and I applaud you for co-parenting this way. You rock!", "What exactly did your son fall out with this guy for?", "NTA that\u2019s good parenting. It\u2019s a punishment that the boy clearly needs. And he is a boy if he thinks he can say that without repercussions and you should tell him that. If for no other reason than it\u2019s a lesson he needs to learn one day and there is no sense in waiting till he says it  in a career/educational setting that fucks his future.", "NTA. What your son said is despicable. You have done the right thing.", "Good job for grounding. Maybe some community service in a poor black neighborhood is in order as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That is disgusting behaviour and he needs a lot of education on the origins and meaning of that word. Please don\u2019t overlook this aspect when dealing with this.", "Wow.  NTA.  First, sounds like you, ex, and stepdad parent well together.  That's really refreshing.  Second, grounded for a month full of fun activities is appropriate.  Third, your son needs to get an education on racism and why we don't use that word.  If all that happens is the grounding, that won't help him really get why that word is awful, and especially since he now has family that is black, he NEEDS to open his mind to their experience.  Please teach him.", "NTA. Good for you for coming down hard on your son's racism.", "I was gonna say YTA by the title but man, that is so f\u2019ed up. \n\nYeah ok, ground him for a month but that is the least of your concerns, you should find a way to go deeper into why he chose to respond that way.\n\nEdit: NTA", "The fact that your Mom and brother think the \u201cpunishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d shows exactly where he learned that despicable behavior.

There are people who'd do far worse than ground him if he uses it in the wrong company.", "NTA your son needs to learn that calling someone the n-word or any slur is unacceptable.\n\nEdited to add: ask everyone that\u2019s supporting your son what they think a suitable punishment for calling his stepdad a word that oppressors used to dehumanize a group a people for centuries. Is your family racist?", "You're NTA!", "NTA - that \u201cone word\u201d can get you arrested, fired, assaulted and even killed\n\nIt\u2019s not just a word \n\nAlso cut down time between your son and your brother and mother, the fact they don\u2019t see an issue makes me wonder if they perhaps influence  him, even if not, he doesn\u2019t need to be around people who support his use do the word", "NTA but you and his mom both need to seek out resources to counter his racism.  Punishment alone won't help with that and may even make this problem worse unless there's also work done to get at the root of the problem.\n\n Checking out the work of Jane Elliot is one good starting point. The Learning for Justice website also has some good resources. \n\nI am reluctant to say Jonathan should be part of this process because the emotional labor involved in countering racism is not something he should have to do in his own home but I am sure he has some suggestions &, for all I know,  would be more than willing to dive in on educating the kid on the issue. \n\nThank you for taking it seriously.", "NTA\nYou definitely have to have a real sit-down talk with him about racism and prejudice.

I would not be happy in his place to have some random moving in, bringing two more people, and decide he can boss me around in my house, this is the type of thing that would absolutely destroy my relationship with a parent. But yeah, he should be punished for using a slur.", "NTA - I think his punishment should also include some education on the subject.  He needs to learn there are consequences for his actions, even free speech.", "NTA. The n word is seriously sensitive and your son used it in a very insulting manner. It does deserve a serious punishment and what\u2019s telling is that all 3 adults are in agreement. \n\nYou do need to sit down and have a talk with your son about racism and where these opinions have come from though. That\u2019s a deeper issue that needs addressing.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a just punishment for an offense that would be serious even if it wasn\u2019t directed at family members. You also need to look into who is letting him believe \u201cwell isn\u2019t it true?\u201d is acceptable and I suspect it\u2019s the people giving you grief now about the punishment.", "NTA and I just want to comment on how refreshing it is to see healthy co-parenting relationships.", "NTA for the punishment\n\nBut step parent relationships are tricky\u2026.that\u2019s why I don\u2019t bother", "The punishment does fit the crime, though. Your son has to realize he was not using just another curse word - but a hateful pejorative. And he did it knowingly and with intent to hurt.\n\nNTA, I applaud your parenting.", "NTA - good for you.  The actual issue aside, this shows great solidarity.  As far as \"overreacting\" goes - your son wasn't just being deliberately hateful to a stranger or casual acquaintance, but to 3 people who live in his actual home!", "NTA and this ladies and gents is how you parent after a divorce.  \n\nThere\u2019s clearly work to be done with your son but well done for standing up for the new step parent when your son is so so so clearly in the wrong.", "NTA! Your son needs to learn that certain things WILL NOT be tolerated.", "NTA- First off, nice to see such functional co-parenting. Well done!  A month doesn\u2019t seem long based on the offense- that has to be stamped out. As a punishment this seems reasonable. \n\nPlease work with a psychologist to make sure the punishment is also well-designed to change his behavior. Part of this is a particularly shitty form of acting out to changes in his life, and he needs to learn the right way to deal with this life stress", "NTA \n\nThank you for being a good parent, and a good coparent, and not putting up with this.", "You are absolutely right to punish your son this way.

If that was my son, I would have punished him even worse; I think that the punishment is actually too light for the crime. NTA", "NTA. Your mother and brother think that calling black people n* is okay? We now know who your son is getting this behavior from. You should be commended for taking this issue seriously and teaching your son that this is unacceptable.", "NTA. And have a feeling your mom and brother have a lean toward racism, at the very least. Thank you for teaching your son respect and how to treat other humans. It's ok to be upset at others, but never ok to insult their being. I'm sure his friends will be fine.", "grounding for the month is not enough. that\u2019s awful, you need to work on doing something that actually fixes the behavior. you\u2019re subjecting jonathan and his kids to living with a nasty racist. please raise your son.", "NTA, you know your Son and what punishment works and what doesn\u2019t work Id say he needs to see the boundaries here and know that you aren\u2019t an ally for a get out of Jail free card.   I think what you have worked up overall with your ex is very mature for the times and like to see couples working together to raise their child.", "NTA but make your son go to some sort of training abt why he shouldn't be using slurs. Use the whole month of December to teach him WHY he shouldn't be using slurs.\n\nSeriously, every single day, make him watch YT videos abt it, take him to a museum abt this history, make him meet with a therapist to explain why it's bad, etc. \n\nHe needs to be inundated with what he did and how hurtful it is to his stepfather and stepsiblings.\n\nYour son was a jerk and used racist language. That is NEVER okay, especially now that a new part of his family is Black.\n\nAnd your family that agrees with him, I wonder how often they've used racist slurs.........", "Your brother and your mom don't get a say.

You can set boundaries around language. I so hope, that this will be an isolated incident for your child, but chances are it won't be. Good luck to you and your family. Stay strong in boundaries around punishment, and reaffirming communication skills throughout your whole family.", "NTA and let me congratulate you, his mom and stepdad for stepping up as an unit and teaching him manners and discipline. \n\nI't important he learns that actions and words have consequences. He will NEVER do this again if you guys hold his punishment all month.", "NTA - It's kind of concerning you had to ask.", "Nta. Thank you for being a parent! Your son will thank you in the future for stopping this behavior before it destroys his life.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Your exactly the kind of parent all kids should have. His reaction was completely unacceptable. Oh and obviously your son didn\u2019t learn this from you, but I would be wary of your brother and Mother.", "NTA at all and if my children ever used that word they would get a far worse punishment than grounding for a month", "Holy moley, NTA.", "NTA, and if anything that's insufficient.  Doesn't sound like he sees the error of his ways.", "Wow, NTA . That's bad by anyone's standards, really bad. You son needs to learn he can't resort to using slurs and demeaning language everytime things don't go his way or he gets in trouble. Say something like that to the wrong person and he can wind up in a world of hurt.", "NTA your son is lucky you\u2019re only grounding him for a month. He\u2019s probably acting out with all the changes in relationship dynamics with your ex and her new family but the way he did it is totally wrong.", "NTA. It\u2019s totally understandable that your son may have trouble adjusting to a blended family, but it\u2019s disappointing that he decided to use racism as a way to lash out. You can\u2019t let that slide. \n\nDo you know what the relationships with his stepbrothers are like? Are there bullying/exclusion issues that might be contributing to this outburst? \n\nYou might need to check on his online activity. The alt-right/white supremacy movement is actively trying to recruit younger white guys, and they are very effective at infiltrating gaming spaces.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure your ex and Jonathan appreciate this more than you know.\n\nIt is worth trying to figure out what kinds of online communities your son is spending time in, he is the perfect demographic to be recruited by alt right creeps. :/\n\nETA: omg y\u2019all. Yes the family reaction is problematic. But unless the son, uncle, and grandma have a secret bunker where they go to be racist for multiple hours a day and no one is around to hear them, it is 500000% more likely a typical teenage boy is spending more time each day on online forums, tiktok, and/or MMO gaming than sitting alone with extended family members but not OP. Limiting access to grandma isn\u2019t going to single-handedly fix the issue if he has virtually unlimited access to toxic spaces online. Goodness.", "It is concerning your family is not taking what he did seriously. NTA.", "NTA and also kudos for great parenting and working with your ex and her new boyfriend in a team. \nFor teenagers its easy to use their divorced parents to get what they want. You taking their side is so powerful.", "NTA! NTA! NTA!\n\n\nTotally appropriate and good for you!\n\nIf your mother and brother honestly believe this relatively minor punishment doesn\u2019t fit this particular crime, they\u2019re a terrible and enabling influence and should be kept away from your son. \n \nOne more time- NTA and good for you. The world doesn\u2019t need anymore racists.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t care how mad I\u2019ve been at somebody, using racial slurs has never ever crossed my mind.  I would worry about where he is getting these ideas.", "NTA. And you are doing your son the biggest favour he will ever receive by making this serious. Going out into the world he will eventually run into this idiocy and he needs to know that it is unacceptable. And now is when to learn that.", "NTA but I think you need to do more work than just ground him. \n\nYou need to talk to your son about why he would think that it\u2019s ever okay to use that word. About how it\u2019s so much more than \u201ca word\u201d. \n\nYou need to talk to him about why he feels that his blended family is ruining his life. \n\nYou need to help him understand how much he would have hurt SD\u2019s feelings and question why he thinks it\u2019s appropriate to attack him like that. P", "NTA. If you don\u2019t teach him how long he is now it\u2019s only gonna get worse and I cannot imagine how he will act to his half sibling that is coming.", "NTA. You\u2019re teaching him early that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.", "NTA you should sit him down each day and show him examples of why it's such a bad word to use, especially in anger", "NTA actions have consequences. He used the worst word possible. You are co-parenting and doing a great job BTW.", "NTA he knew exactly what he was doing", "NTA\n\nBut where is your son picking up his ideology from?", "NTA. My hell...are your mother and brother the ones who taught him to spew that hateful garbage?!?!?! I have raised 3 boys (26-13) and they would be lucky to see the sun again if they said that to ANYONE. Good for you for taking this seriously and holding firm.\n\nYou should also seriously check into some therapy for your son...it is clear he is carrying resentment about the divorce and/or remarriage and if it manifests in this hatefulness he needs some help working it out also to help with the errors in his thinking. That he is confused about why it is bad to say (or think1) when it is \"true\" is a huge red flag that might take a professional to unwind and combat.", "NTA. Not even close. In fact, you would be a HUGE asshole if you let that slide in any way. Kid needs to learn what is and isn't acceptable. It seems like both you and your ex are firmly anti-N-word so I assume he gets that language either from his friend group or the internet communities he's in. Just beware, people usually don't just *say* the N word as an insult without having some underlying racism. So the lesson needs to be deeper than just \"don't say that word, it's not okay\".", "Are brother and mom where he learned it? NTA but you definitely need to have an in depth discussion about WHY that word is so bad as well.", "NTA but I think more needs to be done here in terms of discipline because he obviously doesn\u2019t understand the impact that word can have. There are organizations you could contact who have folks who share their experiences of racial discrimination with young people like your son. He needs to understand how that word makes people feel. It\u2019s not something you throw around because you can\u2019t play videos games. Also, it could ruin his life if said to the wrong person or captured on video. You\u2019ve under reacted with the punishment in my opinion.", "NTA. If anything he probably needs more discipline.", "NTA and sounds like he needs some serious therapy", "NTA *but* the punishment is incomplete.  I see a lot of comments saying it would be nice if some reeducation aspect were a part of his grounding.  I think education and amends NEED to be worked in.  For his development, safety and well-being, he NEEDS to be held accountable for his use of s racial slur.  The grounding is meaningless and will only make him more resentful of his step-family if this atrocious behavior goes unchecked.\n\nShame on your brother and mother for condoning this.  It would be good to send some pointed questions their way too.\n\nEdit to add:  Some ideas would be community work, documentaries, research projects, therapy, including him in discussions of how he should make amends before the arrival of his new brother.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA for grounding your son. Your son is racist and needs to be disciplined. If I was Jonathan I wouldn\u2019t want your son around me or my kids including the one that your ex-wife is currently pregnant with. Definitely need dig into his racism more before it gets worse and he does something that can\u2019t be taken back", "NTA - you need to shut that behavior down immediately!\n\nI'd say grounding isn't enough - might need to assign him some anti-racism reading or sign him up for a class. He needs an education along with the punishment.\n\nEdit: misspelled word", "NTA. This person will most likely be in your sons life for a long time and he\u2019ll have half siblings that are biracial. He needs to learn that using any racial slur is offensive, no matter who it\u2019s pointed towards.", "NTA. Sounds like solid parenting.", "NTA.\n\nTime to distance yourself from your racist mother and brother. Also, gather all his electronics and monitor his online activity, as it's quite possible he's being radicalized online.\n\nDo not take this lightly.", "NTA at all - it sounds like you, your ex, and your ex's new husband are wonderful co-parents - but I'm totally side-eying your mom and brother. Actually \"side-eying\" isn't quite accurate, right now my eyebrows are raised so high they're practically at my hairline. Seems like you need to do a lot of work with them, too, or keep them and their malignant influence away from your son.", "NTA. In all fairness, I'm (white) piss.ed that when black person says it, it's ok but when white person says it, it's called racist. BUT! This is not a racist stuff - it's about respect to family member, to your ex new husband. It's not just joking between friends, when people call each other all kind of things without malicious intent. He (your son) is old enough to know exactly what he was doing. NTA. Thanks for backing up your wife and respect person, she decided to have a family with.", "NTA. Your son's use of this slur is abhorrent and he needs to learn that now before someone decides to teach him that lesson with their fists. I'd also take the opportunity to try to get him to understand why such language can be so harmful to others, because it sure doesn't sound like he gets it now. \n\nAlso your brother and mom thinking you're overreacting amounts to tacit acceptance of abusive language and maybe you should have a talk with them about that. Otherwise how you discipline your child is none of their business.", "NTA, but it sounds like your son doesn't need to be around your mom and brother anymore, since they condone this racist behavior, and likely learned it from them. Your son's words hurt, and he needs to realize that. The punishment DEFINITELY fits the crime, and I wouldn't let it go", "NTA as long as you and your ex agree - the rest of the family can kick rocks", "NTA\nNTA\nNTA \nGreat job and I hope in addition to consequences for his actions, your son realizes the gravity of the words he used.", "NTA. That is not ok to say ever, let alone to a parental figure. I also think that the punishment the right one. It is harsh enough that he won\u2019t think about doing it again but not too abusive. I would tell your brother and mother to stay out of it as it is not their child.", "literally why would you be TA? obviously NTA", "NTA and I think you should consider the fact that your son isn\u2019t taking this seriously if he\u2019s \u201cannoyed\u201d by this punishment. I can\u2019t stress enough how problematic this is. \n\nAlso, a huge WTF is wrong with your brother and mother??!! Holy shit you have some problems there, too.", "NTA\n\noh the punishment fits the crime\n\nThis was decided by his parents. Grandma and uncles can be told, firmly, to butt out. \n\nThink about asking your son to do a book report over break. Like *White Fragility* or *How to be* *an Antiracist*. Maybe shave a week off if he does a good job.", "NTA. Totally fitting punishment. My biggest concern would be where he learned it was OK to ever say something like that. Which forums, gaming groups, friend circles is he part of that accepts that kind of hatred?", "NTA. In fact, I think a month is lenient. You need to nip this in the bud now.", "NTA in the least and your son owes a BIG apology to his step father and step siblings. He would also be on what I termed with my kids when they were teens Gilligan's Island.. no phone, no boat, no motor car, not a single luxury.....", "NTA your son needs to learn that racist bullshit should not be tolerated.", "NTA. A lot of these comments are immediately jumping to your son is a racist idk that I immediately jump to racist especially since he\u2019s 16 and more than likely goes to a high school. When I was 16 people in my school used the N word because they thought it was cool. Your son seems to be acting out because of all the change in close time frame- new step dad, two teenage step brothers and a new baby on the way. 16 year olds tend to be very narcissistic and don\u2019t like being told what to do especially by someone new. \n\nYour son needs to get in to see a therapist immediately, I also recommend a family therapist for you all to contact. \n\nEducate him on the meaning of the word and why it should never be used and why it is so derogatory and hurtful. \n\nHe needs to (genuinely) apologize to your wife\u2019s new husband, his sons and your wife.", "NTA. It needs to be a longer punishment.", "NTA and I among many others will thank you for taking a stand like that.", "NO SIR you\u2019re NTA at all . On top of the punishment he\u2019s been given may I suggest seeking some help to educate your son on how harmful that word is . Im a white woman with white children and I\u2019d hit the fucking roof flying if any of my children ever used that word , much less direct it at someone and then give that answer as a follow up as to why they said it . There\u2019s obvs a reason why he thought it was ok to say and that needs exploring and changed", "So your brother and mom are racist too?  Got it.  \n\nNTA.  You are trying to raise your son right.", "NTA and I think you were entirely correct. Hate speech is nothing to take lightly, and being permissive with your son over this would only encourage him to keep thinking and talking this way. He's 16, and that's old enough to know better; and if he kept doing this into his adulthood, he'd run into some real problems, really fast. \n\nIt's not \"one word\". I'd agree that this was overboard if you grounded him for a month for saying \"fuck\", for example. He'd have a fair point had he not used an actual racial slur. He could stand to learn a little bit about the history of that word, its use in slavery and lynchings, etc. -- he clearly doesn't understand the impact of that word. \n\nWhere did he learn to talk like this? Is this something he gets from his friends?", "NTA, but have you considered also talking to your son? That's some worrying comfort with a slur at 16. It might be worth trying to get ahead of this behavior to try and cut if off before if gets worse. \n\nAnd obviously he can stay grounded. That's so much time for him go learn", "Not only are you NTA, you are father of the year. You are teaching your son respect, and you are also doing a great job co-parenting. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - also \ud83d\udcaf kudos for great shared parenting and communication\n\nI'd also be trying to work out where this comes from, as it clearly isn't you or your ex. Then work on ways to combat that.\n\nMost likely friends, as friends have a HUGE influence compared to almost anyone else, no matter what parents like to think. But very concerning your mother and brother think it's OK.", "NTA. Your son was out of line. Shame on your racist family members for excusing this. Stick to the punishment", "NTA and the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. He should be punished more. Now if he says that crap in public or to Jonathan\u2019s son directly, his mouth might write a check his ass can\u2019t cash!!! This is disgusting and he needs harder consequences. Tell him to say it in the street and see what he gets. He\u2019s acting like a racist and entitled child!!!", "NTA... but please help him to understand why that was so hurtful or all he will get out of this is resentment.", "They agree with your son?!? NTA  Its not just a word.", "NTA\n\nGood on you! Your son is portraying really worrying qualities, good on you for giving proper punishment for his despicable racism. I'm curious, what do Your brother and mom think are proper punishments for overt racism and white supremacy beliefs, because your son is straight up expressing those ideals.", "Its not just the slur, it is the whole thing plus \"I don't have to listen to them anyway.\" \n\nGiving him a pass cos he has plans is BS, it would teach him nothing. Your parents and anyone who think a months grounding is OTT isn't winning any points either, they are racist, as is your son. I think given the context the punishment isn't really enough tbh, as I doubt he will learn anything from it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s a horrible word to use in any context if you are not Black. It\u2019s even worse that he directed it towards a family member.\n\nYour punishment fits the crime, OP.

I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but \"no video games today\" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. \n\nMy ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to \" f*ck off\". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied \"you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway\". \n\nI asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because \"well isnt it true\"). \n\nI lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed.

Although I am curious as to what your mom and brother think is an appropriate punishment for racism.", "NTA for grounding him, it's a serious thing and needs to be dealt with seriously.\n\nBut I would urge you to not leave it there. If this is the only thing you do in response, he will essentially learn not to be caught doing it in future, but whatever is driving this behaviour won't go away.\n\nI would say you need to get to the bottom of what is driving these views/behaviours. Maybe he's knowingly acting out due to something happening out of the home, or he isn't handling the seperation of his parents well, or maybe other family members have been influencing him, or maybe he's been watching/reading things online that are all but radicalising him, I don't know, but I think it's important to find out and deal with the issue of both his racism, and his angry outbursts, sooner rather than later", "NTA but your son will grow into one if you don't address this behavior now. You are doing the right thing", "NTA. Kudos on how you co parent with your ex and her husband.  For the N word, I don\u2019t think being grounded a month is an apt punishment.  That would be for talking back.  But the N word\u2026. He needs to understand why it\u2019s a slur word and being grounded and around your mom and brother, he\u2019ll never understand why.  Some black history readings/ lessons may be a good way to spend his time while grounded", "NTA I guess but a month on punishment is not enough. Your son is showing signs of being racist and if you don't do anything about it then it will only get worse. Right now he's mad at you and doesn't understand why he's in the wrong, this punishment will do nothing but fuel his hatred. Keep him grounded for a month but please at least put him into therapy because this is not okay and will only get worse unchecked.", "I also would   \nhave had a talk with him to find out where he got that slur from and why  \n he thought it appropriate to use it, and then I would forbid him to   \nhave anything to do with anyone who thought it was ok to use it. Because  \n that is not how I raise my children.", "NTA - Absolutely ground him for a month. But I believe that your son also needs some serious education about racial issues, and not from discord servers and Call of Duty chat rooms.\n\nIt may be best to have him stay away from your exes place until he can learn why what he did was wrong and apologize sincerely to Jonathan.", "NTA. At all. Not only are you being a stellar coparent by supporting Jonathon, but also not allowing your son to use hateful slurs when angry. The punishment fits the crime for sure, if not a touch under imo. (I don't know the specifics of how grounded is grounded as all parents do so differently.) Now onto the family saying you were being too harsh, their opinion of what you do with YOUR child doesn't matter. However, maybe let them know that their comments make them come off as racist and that their personal feelings about Jonathan (as it very well could just be it's a new man with their former dil thing vs an actual racist thing) do not matter in this situation. You will not allow your son to grow up ignorant and hateful. Maybe he could do some sort of apology letter or research on the history of racism and how it impacts people of color every day or something to maybe \"earn a lesser sentence\" IF it seems to have made a genuine difference in attitude or behavior. And yes I get that teenagers are \"moody and unruly and he's just acting out because that's what teenage boys do\" but what he said was not acceptable by any stretch of the imagination and even if Jonathon (or his sons, your ex, etc.) forgive him, it's still setting that will never be forgotten. His lashing out could very well come back around to bite him years down the road and that is something he needs to understand.", "NTA u need to sit down with ur son and have a deep conversation. If he says some shit like that in the streets he might get beat up or worst, shot dead.", "NTA. You are a good dad, a good ex, and a good human.", "NTA. But also, just grounding him isn't going to teach the lesson. He needs to be taught empathy because that is clearly lacking. \n\nAlso, even though the way he shared his feelings was awful, he did still share feelings and those need to be addressed. His life is changing in a lot of ways and he clearly needs help adjusting to it. Use the grounding to bond with him and teach him these lessons. And don't automatically write him off as a racist lost cause- he's still a kid and there's so much time to get him on the right track. It just takes effort sometimes.", "NTA \n\nUntil your kid knows what it\u2019s like to grow up marginalized, he has absolutely no right to say it\u2019s \u201cone word\u201d. \u201cFire\u201d is a word but you yell it in a theater you get in trouble. \u201cBomb\u201d is one word but you yell it in an airport and you get in trouble. Just because he didn\u2019t write an essay explaining why he thinks his step-family is \u201cless than\u201d him, doesn\u2019t mean what he did was ok. He has NO idea what it\u2019s like and he had NO right to say that.", "Your brother and mom are racists, sorry to say. NTA", "NTA. You're nailing it being a dad, co-parenting with an ex and her new husband, and just being a decent human being. \n\nHowever I also think you should CLOSELY monitor any social media or anything your son consumes.

Nta", "NTA.\n\nYour son is old enough to know what words to not use.\n\nHowever at the age it\u2019s also hard to understand the weight behind a word that has so much history and abuse behind it.\n\nI think he needs to be more educated on why certain words (basically most if not all racial related slurs) are not okay to use, and are heavier than the usual swears.\n\nI think grounding him for the month, or until he learns why the punishment is so hard, and understands the weight of the words he used against his step dad.\n\nBut if you choose to relax the punishment based on him learning and repenting, I wouldn\u2019t tell him that\u2019s an option, I\u2019d just put some effort into getting him to understand and if you make a breakthrough let him know you\u2019re shortening the sentence.\n\nI have never used that word, however when I was a young teen I didn\u2019t really understand the weight of it, I just understood it is not a word we use, and it is especially not a word we call someone.", "NTA. Glad you punished him for that. \n\nHas your son ever liked his moms husband? From the sounds of it he doesn\u2019t like his step brothers or her husband.  May have to keep him away from them for awhile.", "NTA\n\nI agree with other comments that grounding alone may not teach the complete lesson here. We'd be spending the month at civil rights museums or something along those lines. And he'd need to write some sort of apology to Jonathan and sons.", "NTA at all. Besides the awful word and the associated history of it, what he did has minor consequences right now like being grounded for a month though once he is an adult saying that word can ruin his future in terms of relationships and employment opportunities.\n\nMaybe you could coordinate with your ex and Jonathan to talk with your son about why that word should never be used and the consequences it has. If Jonathan is comfortable with it maybe he could share his experiences as a poc and how using that word upholds racist values in our society. There may even be some free online racial sensitivity classes online you could require your son to take before he is ungrounded. While it is a horrible situation I think this would be the best scenario for your son to learn and understand instead of just being upset, angry, and miserable for a month. Best of luck!", "Your son needs education. Someone is teaching him that this word is okay \u201cwell isn\u2019t it true?\u201d \n\nYou need to get to the root of the problem and remove that person from his life. Sounds like it could be your mom and brother, quite honestly. I think a month is the least he should expect. NTA for one month, but please do more to help your son.", "NTA.  I think your son may need to see a counselor for anger.  This is a pretty serious situation.", "NTA, but your mom and brother may be the AHs. What punishment do they feel is appropriate? Could it be that them downplaying this incident could signal where your son is getting the impression that his behavior was acceptable to begin with?\n\nETA: I also agree with folks that there could be more education on diversity and racism to tack on to his punishment, but also maybe some ongoing counseling or therapy would be good for him. His actions were inappropriate but he may also be lashing out because of how the recent changes in the family dynamic with your ex remarrying, etc., are making him feel. It may be helpful for him to process whether his actions were based in racism or resentment, or a combination.", "NTA- the punishment does fit the crime. But i would absolutely want to know who's feeding him this racist bullshit. I'd look at the family members objecting first.", "NTA at all but I\u2019m not sure how much he\u2019ll learn vs just be angry at all the adults in his life. Other thoughts o have: have him do a research project on the history of the N word and how black people came to be seen as \u201cless than\u201d in our society and how that continues to this day. Then have him write an apology to his stepdad and step brothers. Make him take a class on African American history at the community college. I could go on, but you get the idea. Yes, admonish and express your profound his disappointment but also invest in his learning. His comment and attitude since is extremely ignorant.", "NTA - Shut this crap down now. Rethink about having him spend any time alone with your mom and brother.", "as a black 18yo thank you, i hate kids like yours i\u2019m happy you\u2019re doing something about it, nta", "NTA, make him READ during this month.", "NTA and please spend some time educating your son on the history of this word, how harmful it is, and the consequences he will face professionally and socially if he continues to act this way.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you punished him harshly ENOUGH.", "It would be so much fun if ops brother or mom go say that to any black person. How can your son be such a b if it's just chores we are talking about. NTA op. And be sure to teach him properly about this issue.\n\nAlso very big question. Does he play those cod fortnite games. Those games lobby are filled with young children who fire the n word like it's a machine gun. So be sure to monitor it", "My dude you are NTA and if anything you are going easy on him.  Don't let him get into your head, he is getting a pretty mild punishment for some racist bullshit, and if he keeps it up when he's older the rest of the world will be MUCH less kind than you were.", "Woah, that's something were my hand could've slipped. NTA and one month of being grounded is surely not enough. He didn't just said the N-word, he said he isn't going to take orders from him, because he's black. That's incredible racist and shows how little understanding your son has about history.", "NTA , this raises a lot of red flags like someone is teaching him very racist ideas to the point he\u2019s proudly admitting it\nYou\u2019re doing a good job coparenting I suggest finding out how he got these kind of ideas this can end up being very dangerous", "NTA - But rather than simply grounding him, you should utilize this moment to teach your son the weight and history of this word and why it\u2019s not okay for him to say it under any circumstances", "NTA. I think the punishment is minimal for what was said and the intentions of why your son said it. I hope this is a wake up call that 1) your son needs help and needs to be educated on the topic of racism and that 2) your brother and mom are racists since they seem to be ok with this whole ordeal.", "First, as a step-father, I commend you, your ex, and Jonathan for having things set up as well as you do. This is absolutely not always the case, and too often turns into a \u201cwe/they\u201d world, which is awful for all parties involved, but especially the kids. That you\u2019re trying to provide a consistent and stable \u201cwhat applies here, applies there\u201d is good to see. \n\nSecond, you\u2019re NTA - but your kid definitely needs some help. I won\u2019t go as far as to say that he\u2019s an AH, but his behavior is surely AH-ish. He probably could benefit from some counseling, and - once things calm down - an honest conversation with \u201cwhy did you call him that,\u201d and \u201cwho that you hang out with talks like that?\u201d\n\nThis sort of behavior is often learned/coached by someone else that your son is in contact with, and it\u2019s important to find out who that is. Then review this with your son and make it absolutely clear that you do not like or condone that language, and that you will not tolerate it. \n\nThe \u201cyou ruined my life\u201d thing is a bit over the top, unless he - for some reason - thinks that Jonathan is why you and your wife are not together. You didn\u2019t really go into that, and it\u2019s none of my business. But this is where I think that your son needs someone that he can talk to in an effort to get to the root of his anger and pain. \n\nYour mother and brother are not helping, and it\u2019s somewhat telling that they don\u2019t see what the reason is for all the fuss. Maybe they\u2019re a part of the driving force for your son\u2019s angst? It\u2019s also none of their business how you and your wife discipline your son. He owes your wife\u2019s husband respect and dignity, unless there is some other issue there (abuse, etc), although that doesn\u2019t seem like the case. \n\nYour son is angry, and probably more than a little embarrassed, which\u2026 it\u2019s hard to deal with when you\u2019re a fully functioning adult, much less when you\u2019re a 16 year old boy. Sometimes they can own up to it and work to fix things, other times they\u2019ll double-down and try to fight. \n\nI don\u2019t think that you\u2019re wrong to ground him, though. But I think that you should also talk with him and try to see if you can get to the root of his anger, and even offer him a route to get out of being grounded if he does certain things, such as show contrition, give Jonathan (AND his sons) an honest apology, and try to work from there. If he has no shot at redemption, then where is his incentive to try to be better? Why improve if it still results in being grounded?\n\nIt sounds like your son is dealing with something bigger, and this is just where and how he decided to lose his shit.", "Your brother and your mom are idiots.  NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. Good on you for standing up for what\u2019s right. \n\nYour mom and brother are right though\u2014 the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime. You need to think of something more harsh. The N word isn\u2019t just a word and he needs to understand that.", "NTA but as a black person, I wouldn't want your son around his stepfather or step siblings. It's traumatic to be around people who've been actively racist against us, and I say that as someone with white family who has called me the n word. It's not something you forget. I also don't think the punishment is harsh enough. He needs active anti-racist teaching, you need to go through his internet history and see what right wing content he is consuming and put a stop to that, and you need to act as if his racism is an indicator of a possibility of physical violence because it is. Your son is dangerous, and that needs to be dealt with immediately beyond just a grounding.", "No. NTA even remotely.", "NTA punish him harder", "Absolutely fucking not TA. I applaud your choice and respect you wholeheartedly as a parent, and I wish your son the best as he learns to better himself.", "Nta and he needs therapy. It doesn't sound like he learned this from his family so maybe do a dive into where he is learning this. Maybe it's his friends or social media and he isn't mature enough to know how to handle the stuff he may be hearing from people around him or what he's watching.", "Absolutely NTA Keep up the good parenting and parenting with your ex", "NTA! I agree that you should also assign reading, essay writing, and have a thorough discussion to determine his understanding. This is massive, you have a real chance here to try to shape his thinking, as much as you can. Individual and family therapy too. Someone suggested he no longer be allowed to go to his mom\u2019s house, I disagree! As long as the step brothers and the new baby can feel safe.", "NTA sounds like proper Co Parenting to me", "NTA and also, educate him please. Make him use the time to understand what he did wrong. Do it together with him. In the end, that\u2019s more important than a punishment (which in itself, won\u2019t teach him anything internally)", "Nta absolutely not over reacting.  Grounding him for swearing and using a slur is completely normal punishment.", "I am recoiling. If he had just said the word among friends it would still be wrong but to call an actual black person that word is just\u2026 despicable. Good on you for trying to correct your son\u2019s behaviour. But you do have to look at where he is getting these views from.\n\nNTA", "NTA! Where\u2019s the apology? One month punishment doesn\u2019t seem like enough to me but that\u2019s me. Good you and his mom can agree on how to handle. But the punishment wo making amends falls short for me. As for the other family members seems like he only said the quiet part out loud.", "NTA. Racism is not tolerable. HE needs to also be educated on why that word is bad. It also wouldn't be a bad idea for some continuous therapy to deal with having someone other then you and his mom parent him. Parents get divorced mom gets married to a guy who has two kids and now there is a baby on the way. Maybe check to see if being full time with you would be better.", "NTA. Nip racism in the bud early and let him know that hateful sort of thinking isn't okay.\n\nAlso might be a good idea to start paying attention to what media he consumes and who he hangs out with. These types of opinions are never ever self-taught.", "Wow\u2026. Definitely NTA. He is 16 and old enough to know better. That wasn\u2019t an accident and he knows exactly what he did.", "First of all, huge kudos to OP for awesome co-parenting and for sending a clear message that racism is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nBut also wanted to add- it seems pretty clear that your son wasn't raised in racist homes. Is your son truly racist, or is this his way of lashing out in the most horrible way he can think of to express his unhappiness over changing family dynamics with the new step family and upcoming half-sib?\n\nThe answer to that shouldn't change the punishment- that's spot on- but should there also be therapy to address underlying issues?\n\nNTA", "Oh fuuuuuck no. You are absolutely right to levy a harsh punishment due not only to his words but that mindset. My son is only 2 but so help me god if I have to deal with that - I have literally no idea how I will keep my cool. Kudos to you for being level headed and calm (presumably). And for having a united front with your ex and her new husband. NTA.", "I\u2019d turn it around and ask him exactly what has he done in his life that makes him believe he is superior to anyone. That\u2019s the thing with supremacists, they champion the accomplishments of other people as if they are their own. He did nothing except be born White and tell your mother and brother you\u2019ll be damned before you have the next Dylan Roof in your house.", "NTA\n\nThe punishment seems a little light to me personally but I digress. Also go low to no contact with your brother and mom for a while if not indefinitely.", "I think sometimes we get caught up in the punishment that we overlook the lesson. Grounding him isn't teaching him anything, and it doesn't really fit the crime. At 16, he's young, ignorant and impressionable. I'm assuming this is the first time he has behaved this way, so it's possible that because he feels angry and blames Jonathan he knew this slur would hurt him. But that doesn't mean he fully grasps the severity of his words. And he won't without proper intervention. \n\nI'd say this is a great opportunity to educate him and teach him empathy, and guide him towards changing his heart and mindset. Ask him why he chose this word, what he thinks it means, etc. and give him an opportunity to speak openly and honestly. Let him know you're there to understand him before you attempt to correct the behavior. Then teach him the history, show him the damage, and mediate a conversation between him and Jonathan. Let Jonathan explain how and why it hurts him. Maybe even find an appropriate charity that he can do community hours at. \n\nThe end goal here isn't to teach your son that this behavior will be punished so he should hide it. It's to help him understand that's its wrong, and why it's wrong. Think of the bigger picture and how you can use this moment to help your son grow.\n\nAs Desmond Tutu said \"There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to\u00a0go upstream and find out why they're falling in\". I think this somewhat applies here.", "First off, NTA.  Second, a month of punishment is not ideal here, IMO.  I believe racism is rooted in ignorance.  Instead of punishing him for a period of time, I would suggest you punish him with some reading, maybe have him watch some movies (documentaries or otherwise), and then have him write a report about what he has learned.  Also, after doing all this he should be made to write a an apology letter to his stepdad about what he has learned and why he was wrong.\n\nSimply taking away free time and electronics doesn't really teach him why he was wrong.  Especially when he said \"isn't it true\" AND his uncle and grandmother are his side.", "NTA. But your son is.", "NTA. Maybe look into what kinds of media he\u2019s consuming online. Like YouTube videos and that sort of thing. There\u2019s a lot of neo-nazi propaganda out there targeted specifically at white teenaged boys. He\u2019s clearly picked up some very outwardly racist views from somewhere and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s from you or your ex. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s in the process of being red-pilled.", "NTA but you need to look into where he is learning this shit. It isn't uncommon for young men to be radicalized online. He is 16, but because of his behaviors his online activity needs to be looked in to with heavy restrictions, and he should be put into therapy. Lack of action will only make this fester. (edit to add: also the fact that your brother and mother agree with your son is concerning. Does he spend a lot of time alone with them? Could they be learning this language and behavior from them? People aren't born racist. They learn it from the environment around them.)", "NTA , no hard no , only a month?", "Nta, seems like when he followed up the comment with no remorse he deserves disciplining. If he wants to be successful that attitude won\u2019t fly in the \u201creal world\u201d. Kind of surprised your family isn\u2019t backing you up, makes it seem maybe that isn\u2019t a big deal to them? Disciplining well deserved.", "NTA, your kid should be very glad that the worst y\u2019all are doing is grounding him. Honestly his punishment should have a bit more severity, that\u2019s a fucked up thing to think let alone say.", "Honestly it isn't even about a specific word, he was extremely disrespectful to his stepfather and that deserves said punishment. He is a teenager trying to push boundaries. Great parenting!  NTA", "NTA.  At first I thought maybe your son was just naive and was repeating something he had heard his step-brothers say to each other, but your son obviously used the word inappropriately and with malice.  He needs to be educated as to WHY it is wrong for a white person to say that. He needs to understand the long history of the usage of that word and then show sincere remorse.  Others here have mentioned books and other resources to educate him.  There was a great episode of Blackish where Anthony Anderson explained in detail why the use of the N-word is inappropriate. That episode was funny, serious, and educational.", "NTA. You now know where the son gets it from so you can start distancing y'all from them. And educate why it's bad.\n\nBut please don't ignore the part about him feeling like they ruined his life. It's funny how a lot of people here are saying that's blatant disrespect but if your son was the one posting about it (without the word) everyone would be on his side. He's clearly has some sort of feeling and may have been overlooked.", "You did great and need to nip this in the bud ASAP. This is just the start his shitty behavior.", "NTA.  You are being a great dad here.  If there is any truth to them saying the punishment doesn't fit the crime - it's that the punishment may be too lite.\n\nWhat the kid said was horrible and he deserves some significant consequences here - the last thing you want to do is sweep this under the rug and have your son think being racist is acceptable.  \n\nTell your brother and mom that you don't condone racism and that they don't get a vote on how your raise your son.\n\nKeep up the good work.", "If anything, the punishment could be worse given the severity of his infraction.", "If anything I think it's too light of a punishment. \n\nYes it sucks to have a holiday month being grounded but he showed no remorse. As others said you need to look into why he's acting up and what company he's keeping (and hey maybe it is uncle and gramma the problem!l) that makes him seem like it's ok.\n\nHe needs to understand what he did wrong and fix his act. That could be counseling. It could be volunteering in a black outreach charity where he could perhaps see first hand the sort of issues they face and maybe make connections there. But just punishment without something else that will make him actually understand why might just lead to resentment specially if some family members side with him.", "Info: have you dig into his comment about Jonathan and his sons ruining his life? NTA for the question at all because nothing excuses a slur, but there is obviously more going on here. Why does he blame Jonathon?  It sounds like he doesn\u2019t see his mom much because of her new family and he is resentful. If you don\u2019t get to the bottom of the issue at hand, the grounding won\u2019t solve the issue.", "NTA, while he definitely did something messed up, it\u2019s hard for kids to process divorce and a parent starting a new family. when they don\u2019t know how to handle those big feelings it causes them to act out. you can see he\u2019s definitely blaming the new husband and his kids for ruining his family, it might be good to have a talk about how relationships can end sometimes and it\u2019s not always someone\u2019s fault!", "NTA - holy crap your son is old enough to know better. There's a lot to unpack here, not just the use of the N word (which, big, big NOPE.) But also that he's blaming Jonathan for \"ruining his life?\" How exactly does he think Jonathan and his kids ruined his life? It sounds like everything between the grown-ups is amicable. Please sit down and have a major talk with your son about respect and boundaries because he clearly needs it explained (likely for the umpteenth time.)", "NTA, you really need to get the bottom of your son\u2019s behavior and he has a lot to unlearn. Have the three of you discussed how you will navigate his relationship with the upcoming baby? The baby needs to be protected from his/her racist half-brother.", "NTA But a month of grounding wouldn\u2019t be enough. He was racist ah and isn\u2019t even apologetic for his behavior. He\u2019s about to have mixed race siblings, that attitude needs to be put in check.", "Perhaps therapy would help. Sounds like he has issues with mom being pregnant which wouldn\u2019t make him #1 with her time, so to speak and being around grandma and Uncle are grooming him wrong.", "The punishment is more than appropriate to the crime. I'm guessing anyone who thinks otherwise is where he learned it.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA sounds like you\u2019ve got coparenting nailed. Your son used the word intentionally to get a reaction. He found out that behavior has consequences. The response was clear and consistent. Choose the behavior, choose the consequences.

I\u2019d offer help for him to learn better techniques to handle his frustration", "Ok, let\u2019s take a step away from the racism for a second. Your son said that he and his kids ruined his life.

Kids don\u2019t just whip out the N word and say \u201cbut it\u2019s true isn\u2019t it?\u201d without having heard it elsewhere before.

Whether it's your mom and brother, his gaming buddies, somewhere else, this doesn't pop out of the blue most of the time, and if it did then he needs to learn not to react to situations with the most angry and hateful things he can think of. That is always going to lead to him being nothing but bitter and angry at every turn and lead him into situations where he'll wish he'd have swallowed the words. Plus it's just fundamentally a mean way to go about treating others..\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you're getting a lot of \"he needs to learn before someone else teaches him not to\" whether it be legally (getting fired) or physically (getting his shit kicked in). I don't disagree there at all, however he also needs to learn that there's some things you just owe people, because of basic respect for them as a person. Such as not using slurs against them regardless of whether they'll actually do anything to you about it, because as someone who grew up in a diverse area and (obviously) knows black people, a lot of them feel more disrespected than outright anger or retaliation whenever they've told me stories of having that word used against them. Yes there's the rightful anger, but the immediate reaction is feeling hurt and disrespected. It shouldn't just take the threat of getting repercussions, he's disrespecting and degrading someone's entire being over something that has zero bearing on what kind of person they are and he needs to understand it's wrong.", "NTA.
