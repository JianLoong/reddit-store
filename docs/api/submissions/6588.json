My step-father sure thinks so, my brother agrees with me, and my mom is just trying to find a way to make everyone happy.\n\nI (16F) do not get along well with my step-sister Jenna (15F).  I\u2019m not like rude or mean to her, but we\u2019re just really different people and dealing with her is kind of exasperating.  I\u2019m sure I probably annoy her, too, but our parents really want us to spend time together so we have forced family activity time weekly.\n\nThe problem is that our skill levels are really mismatched on most things and it\u2019s causing problems. I pick up things pretty quickly, so usually most games I have the hang of after a few rounds and I\u2019m an athlete so anything physical is easier for me. I also just like learning new things and challenges anyway so maybe I\u2019ve learned how to learn better, idk.  Jenna is a lot slower, not as fit with physical stuff, and just doesn\u2019t pick up things easily.  So, like with hiking, we always have to do the slow easiest trails so Jenna can keep up. With board games, we have to go back over the rules so often games take forever and there\u2019s no challenge in it. It seems like no matter what it is, she\u2019s lagging and frustrated and I\u2019m bored and restless from holding back. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s doing anyone any good, I\u2019m not having fun having to do the bunny slope version of everything and she\u2019s not having fun comparing herself to me.\n\nI\u2019ve told my mom and step-dad but they insist it\u2019s important for us to \u201cbond\u201d and they say I just need to be more patient with Jenna.  Over Christmas, we went ice skating and it turned into a huge deal because neither of us had skated before but I watched some other people and then fell a few times, but got the hang of it while Jenna barely stayed upright and ended up stomping off crying. So I told our parents alone later that I don\u2019t want to do these outings with Jenna anymore and if they make me go I\u2019m not participating because everyone feels bad.\n\nMy step-dad said I just need to do things with her that she\u2019s good at. I asked \u201cWhat is she good at?\u201d because I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019d do it if I did.  That pissed him off and he went off about how I look down on her and try to make her look bad, but he didn\u2019t answer the question.\n\nSo now Jenna is moody and depressed, step-dad is mad, my mom is irritated because I\u2019ve stopped participating in family time, and idk what I did wrong. My older brother (22M) says step-dad doesn\u2019t even know what she\u2019s good at and he\u2019s mad he couldn\u2019t answer, but my brother doesn\u2019t like them so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "created_utc": 1672948357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1048am7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_activities_with_my/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you guys go to the movies or something \ud83d\ude44 that everyone can do? \nThey are setting you guys up for failure and hostility, not bonding. Why doesn't Jenna pick an activity?", "You asked a legitimate question. Unless your presentation was sarcastic, NTA. The solution may be having a conversation with Jenna to let her know that you aren't trying to make her feel bad, and you are sorry if she feels that way, and see if you can come to some kind of understanding where you don't have to hold back, and she doesn't take it personally (I know, but try anyway), then throw in suggestions for things you enjoy that you can each do at your own pace. How about go-cart racing?", "NTA I don't get why so many y t a and e s h. In such situation I would also ask what OP asked, the step sister choose 6 of 10 from the activities and neither has fun. If that's what bonding means I personally would pass and why should they bond?", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have to slow your pace for her sake. And she shouldn't be forced to do things at your pace either. That's not good for her or her mental health. You are two different people and should be treated as such. It feels like stepdad is trying to force her to be more like you. Jenna should be  given a chance and space from the forced togetherness (which helps no one and just breeds resentment) to do her own thing. I bet she would flourish then, if doing things she likes and under no pressure to do them the same way that you do. Stepdad shouldn't force the relationship. He should leave you two to bond organically and maybe with time, you will find something that you have in common with her and enjoy doing together.\n\nEdited.", "Honestly? The real assholes here are your parents. Forced bonding doesn't work. They need to allow you girls to find common ground on your own. \n\nForcing you to hold back, is not fair to you,and it makes you resent her. The fact that you pick up in things better than she does, ultimately humiliates her and she ends up resenting you. No one wins here. \n\nI would try and ask her what she enjoys doing. Maybe you'll find that you both really like a TV show or Movie or go for some food together. Bonding doesn't have to happen with things that require being athletic or board games. Sometimes bonding is finding out that the other person likes the same Chinese food place that you like so sometimes you eat there together. \nTry other things and keep in mind that everyone here is doing what they think is best. Go easy on her and on yourself.\n\nNo judgement from me. Just some advice.", "INFO: Are you planning on showing this thread to your parents? I think they need a wake up call. I really feel bad for Jenna in all of this and your parents solutions are making everything worse. Are you all in family therapy (THIS IS A MUST)?  \n\n\nI think they need to let Jenna find her own feet with people she chooses vs forcing the two of you to bond when you clearly have very different skill levels and things you enjoy, and yeah, people are not equal at all things and having her try to learn something new only to always be overshadowed by you (sounds like you realize this so you're no AH really) is just ruining it for her. Going NTA but Jenna needs some better help or she's going to crash hard and your parents are doing the opposite of what needs to be done.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s ridiculous to make you bond with a stranger or do anything you don\u2019t want to do for that matter.", "NTA. your brother is right. Furthermore your forced family time is stupid and probably some psychological projection of your step-dads inability to have a functioning traditional family rather than your current blended family situation. It's pretty common.", "Definitely NTA, neither one of the kids are. The parents need some help understanding forcing a stepsibling bond to happen is not the best way to blend the family. \n\nAfter reading all your comments, I see that you genuinely wants to know what she's good at so that you all can do that. Also, I think it was tactful to have that conversation separately with the parents.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmake it video evenings. **Nobody is bad at watching a film.** And alternate with selecting the films.", "NTA, but maybe you can have a talk with Jenna, leave your brother, mom, step-dad, out of it. Ask her what she enjoys doing. I saw where you said she chose some of the outings, she may just be choosing those types because it seems like what everyone else likes. Maybe do a day that isn't the whole entire family being forced to bond, just try and spend time with her, without there being a game, sport, etc. I will say, it's a bit rude to imply she isn't good at anything, because she may be great at something, that you may not be, it just sounds like the activities being picked isn't her strong suit. Your parents aren't doing any good with this, and it's likely hurting and upsetting Jenna. They need to start allowing and/or suggesting things like movie nights, spa nights, etc. Something everyone can do and get into.", "ESH\n\nThis sounds like torture and not bonding time so your parents should knock it off. You could have been more tactful. Has anyone ever asked her how she feels about this forced torture time or what she would like to spend her time doing while counting down the minutes until she is as free of you as you are of her?", "Have you asked Jenna what she would like to do in these family times? Maybe she'd like to bake, or paint, or make up limericks. Who is deciding on the activities? Perhaps you and Jenna need to take over the planning. Just a thought. As it is, it sounds awful for everyone. NTA, but maybe extend an olive branch without the parents involved and see what happens.", "It's pretty clear that the options given for bonding time aren't working.  It always ends with you outperforming Jenna and her upset that she's behind.  \n\nYou've brought this up with the parents, yet they just don't do anything, only tell you to be patient with Jenna, even though that didn't end well either.\n\nBecause of your comment, \"What is she good at?\", it's a bit hard to decide on whether this is an NTA or ESH because it's a harsh comment, but it's clear that for the most part, you're not in the wrong.", "NAH and they will all get over it. Her dad is also frustrated bc he wants his daughter to shine in something, anything, really. But it's clear she doesn't and that's ok.\n\nYou, my golden girl, have to be patient a little more and maybe find a compromise solution, but leave the parents out of this discussion that you need to have with your step sister. Team up together to do activities that doesn't involve them. Let me give you some ideas: going to the beach, you can swim or do whatever athletic stuff while she's reading a book or just sunbathing. Or what I was doing with my cousin, we were going clubbing together, but except for him bringing me a beer every hour and to check on me, we didn't actually interact. He was even chaperoning while I was casually smooching his best friend \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Or you could go on a city trip together without the parents, drop her where she wants and you do you. Your parents will be happy that there's a complicity between you two, that's all they ask.\n\nYou might be surprised to find out there's a quality to everyone regardless of their IQ and if she is nice with you, you'll have a blast.", "YTA maybe she is better at being nice?

Why are adults constantly requesting you complete if your skills are so miss matched.  Stop judging her without knowing her.  Ask HER what she likes.", "ESH. Part of being in a family is making concessions for each other. There's always going to be someone who needs more accommodation. But at the same time, it's not healthy that every activity has to be the whole family, especially if one person is getting to pick most of them and set the pace.

She is your younger sister so of course she isn't as good as you and doesn't have the same interests but your parents are correct spending time together is about being together not about being the best at everything. It is possible your parents can potentially find better activities where the skill difference isn't as much of an issue. There are lots of ways to potentially handle it aside from skipping family time. Your parents definitely need to work better at understanding your concerns and coming up with a solution rather than just getting irritated at you. That doesn't help.", "YTA I'm perfect and my stepsister not is such a  bratty attitude.  People learn at there own rate if you let her grasp.somthing once she fi ay.has it maybe you'd have  a bond.

I know you may have been asking a genuine question, but it def comes across as questioning your step-sister\u2019s capabilities esp given how you\u2019ve described her in earlier parts of your post. \n\nI get how you and others can get frustrated when you have to repeat instructions or constantly try to find different activities to fit different people\u2019s needs, but I think it would help to understand that everyone\u2019s different and everyone learns at a different pace even if they\u2019re close to the same age. So a little patience, sympathy, and maybe a little encouragement can go a long way in helping your step sis next time in some of the activities. I\u2019m almost certain your step sis can feel the tension and frustration that others feel and that could make her doubt her abilities and interests which can explain why, when asked, she wouldn\u2019t know what she\u2019d wanna do. This same tension/frustration can also make her feel even more anxious or self conscious ab learning new things which can affect how she learns. Obviously idk her but I\u2019ve seen it in my sis too growing up. She couldn\u2019t pick up things as quickly but it wasn\u2019t cuz she wasn\u2019t smart or incapable but cuz she just learns differently and with the proper guidance and encouragement, she\u2019s thriving now. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sure the both of you are still adjusting to new step life, so it\u2019s okay to not want to constantly spend time with your new family members.

My only advice is, try and be patient, college is right around the corner.", "NTA your brother is 100% right and that was my immediate thought after reading that.", "Yeah, in a lot of those games, the best players end up directing everyone else on how to use their turns to make sure the group beats the game. This can be okay -- for example, Pandemic and my brilliant friend, G, who could pull this off without annoying everyone else because he's just so damned nice and warm and charming.  But it can also sour the whole experience -- for example, Pandemic and my BIL, D, whose competitiveness just gets amped up in cooperative games if anyone shows the slightest hesitation in following his direction or doesn't immediately understand his decisions. (Lesson: Be G, not D.)\n\nGiven the dynamic here, cooperative games likely would only work if OP deliberately deferred to everyone else on decision-making and took little to no initiative.\n\nGames that rely largely on luck MIGHT work.  In that category, Flux and its various expansion packs is my go-to.", "Nta You should add this into your post, it sheds a new light into the situation", "Ugh. Sounds like she\u2019s the one turning it into winning and losing.", "NTA. You, for whatever reason has a bit more natural talent than your step sister, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where she\u2019s likely overly critical of herself because she feels she cannot keep up. You cannot baby her to make her feel better. Your step dad is not looking at her maladaptive issues and keeps acting like if the family gets along all will be fixed. He needs to deal with his kid.", "I agree have a movie night, how about do a puzzle together that doesn\u2019t take any instructions at all. Go see a concert, show, or game. That doesn\u2019t require someone to be physically fit or to understand any kind of instructions. Some people just are slower at things and how they understand things. There are so many other things they could do", "i mean, Jenna\u2019s father couldn\u2019t even answer that and *he\u2019s Jenna\u2019s father.* OP mentioned in a comment that Jenna likes art so they went to a painting thing. But then Jenna had a fit and destroyed her work bc she thought OP\u2019s work was better.\n\nJenna (& the parents) are subconsciously turning the activities into competitions while OP is trying to stay interested in the activities (& isn\u2019t even thinking of competing).", "Have you tried talking with her when the parents are not around? Let her know you are open to getting to know eachother better but the forced family outings seem to lead to frustration. Ask if she has any ideas.", "INFO: Did your step-dad say anything that his daughter was good at?", "NTA. However, they've got to stop forcing this weird \"connection\" with you two. I get family game nights, but just because you're practically the same age doesn't mean you have to be up each other's asses. You do need to respect her, though. Your comment was a bit disrespectful. I understand that you can do things easier than her, but sometimes life is harder for others. You can't push your way onto her. It's not how it works. Apologize for your comment, but you need to have a serious conversation with your parents to stop pushing this \"connection\". \n\nAlso, I'm a twin sister. We didn't have the same friends, same clothes, same activities. And we get along just fine.", "NTA. I\u2019m like Jenna. My favorite hobby is reading. But don\u2019t ask me about the book I\u2019m reading, please. My second favorite hobbies are woodworking and welding and you better know not to get in my space while I\u2019m working. Then come needlework, crochet and crosstitch mainly, but don\u2019t talk to me because I\u2019m listening to a Monk or Psych episode. \n\nMy husband and adult kids are very physical, they\u2019re just good at many sports. What do we do together? Watch movies. Have long conversations while eating at home or out. And then, there\u2019s enough one-on-one activities when the kids visit. \n\nI would simply hate somebody who was forcing me to do activities I don\u2019t enjoy, and am not interested to learn.", "I don't know why, but i feel a certain way about you after reading this.  It's very weird...but i'm not a fan.  I mostly feel sorry for Jenna.  You're so dead set on not hanging out with her that you probably do try to make it as uncomfortable as you can.  Yeah, it's not your place, but damn...do you have to make her out to be so slow at everything.  Is there anything at all that you like about her?\nI definitely think family time between the 2 of you should stop.  Jenna actually needs to be around someone who actually likes her and doesn't feel that she's always less than.", "The step-dad doesn't want to admit his kid isn't as clever/talented, etc, as his step-daughter, which isn't fair on either of them.", "Some people really are just blessed.  It's frustrating for normies in their periphery, but marrying into the family of one and having to live in their shadow would be really rough.", "Not even subconsciously!", "NTA, your parents shouldn\u2019t be forcing time together they need to let it happen naturally because that will cause more emotional damage and resentment with you and Jenna. \n\nMaybe suggest to her a girls day out just you and Jenna, get your hair done, nails, grab some food and watch a movie. Just spend time together without your parents watching over and supervising. Also this is more directed at Jenna and not you but there\u2019s a saying \u201ccomparison is the thief of joy\u201d constantly comparing yourself to others whether it\u2019s in looks, family life, love life, artistic talent, musical talent, athletic talent basically everything (yes I\u2019m guilty of it) is going to do a shit load of internal mental and emotional damage and it\u2019s self inflicted. It can be hard to not compare yourself but constantly doing it isn\u2019t going to be good for yourself and other people will get sick of it.", "NTA This is your parents' fault. They need to let you coexist without forcing you to \"bond,\" which isn't happening anyway.", "NTA.", "NTA. But I would find out if she really wants to do stuff or not. They\u2019ll probably listen if neither of you want to do stuff. \n\nThe easy way out is to stop holding back. That might make you a bit of an ah but the real ones are your mom and sd for forcing it.", "Yta be nice", "Agree, NTA, but something that caught my eye was OP saying she\u2019s tired of holding back. I\u2019m just imagining her not holding back and having the most competitive spa day or museum trip ever", "Jenna? Is that you?", "I think you are missing the point. She feels inferior to you because she struggles with everything and you find things easy to pick up and do. That is not something that you can fix easily. I'm not going to say you are the AH here, but a little bit more empathy and understanding wouldn't go amiss.", "Flux is good for quick gamers but there\u2019s a lot going on for people who pick games up slowly. \n\nIn my experience, slow gamers aren\u2019t there for the game; they are there for the community aspect\u2026 simple dice or card games are the best in that case, where there is one action per turn.", "NTA. But neither are Jenna. Your parents are though. \n\nPoor girl, this forced bonding where she sees herself behind every time must be doing horrible things to her self confidence. \n\nI think you are showing yourself to be really caring and a good person by trying to allow her to pick the activities. But she is also in a tough spot, because what is she supposed to do if she is not allowed to pick e.g. watching a movie. My guess is she wants to do this just as little as you do.", "NAH\n\nI don't really want to judge you because this is a tough situation you're in, but it sounds like your step-sister is just kind of dumb. \n\nIt's not her fault. It doesn't change her worth as a person. It just means that, yes, she learns slowly and is generally worse at any particular activity than you are. \n\nIf you're feeling frustrated, imagine how she must be feeling, always feeling like the dumb one. \n\nYou're under no obligation to like this girl or do things with her. But I think it would be an immensely *kind* thing for you to find something you can do with her where she doesn't feel dumb. \n\nYou guys could go to the movies, go to the mall, get a manicure, paint pictures, go on a picnic (when the weather warms up,) listen to music, play with puppies, bake cupcakes, etc etc. There are lots of options. \n\nTry talking to your mom when you are both feeling calm and ask for some advice on non-competitive ways to hang out with your step-sister. (But don't call her dumb.)", "NTA your parents are the ones forcing the bonding and it seems like her dad isn\u2019t even recommending things that she enjoys or excels at. Ultimately it makes her feel bad because she\u2019s not picking it up as quick as you and it makes you feel guilty about being good at stuff. That\u2019s not beneficial for anyone", "I loved Tivoli Gardens in January.\n\nJuat walked around and watched people.\n\nThere was also a HUGE celebration in town square bc they won international ping pong title.\n\nGorgeous city,  many love humans.", "Ah OP I'm so sorry.  I would like to point out that you are BOTH in the exact same situation, and having very similar feelings of frustration around this new family dynamic. Weirdly, that might be something for you both to bond over.   \nLike everyone else has said, maybe try planning family outings that don't involve ANY form of competition, like going to a museum, visiting a nearby city, watching movies, going to a convention or something.  Something where you are just jointly consuming the activity, rather than actively participating.  Also have you tried doing something (Again, watching a movie or something simple) without either of your parents? Just the two of you?", "You're NTA, but you can still learn from this. Even animals let others \"win\" something like 30% of the time when they're playing and they're better. So like lion cubs wrestling, the big cub let's the little one win.\n\nYou might not be trying to compete but your sister is. Maybe pick something she could reasonably win at and let her do a better job every once in a while.\n\nIf it's simply not possible for her to beat you or match you, then let her set the skill level first and then just match it. With ice skating, you could've hung out at the wall until she got the hang too. When she decided to quit, you could have quit and you two could have gone and grabbed a snack and talked instead of skating. \n\nShe isn't going to be the only person in your life that you run into this issue on. Practice getting better at not making others feel inferior. It is a valuable skill.", "I honestly feel like the step sister is really trying to one up OP and is getting so frustrated that she's losing. The step sister needs to adjust her own emotions, I feel like OP is doing the best she can buy doing what the step sister wants and even suggesting not to do things period!"]}
