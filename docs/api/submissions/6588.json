My step-father sure thinks so, my brother agrees with me, and my mom is just trying to find a way to make everyone happy.\n\nI (16F) do not get along well with my step-sister Jenna (15F).  I\u2019m not like rude or mean to her, but we\u2019re just really different people and dealing with her is kind of exasperating.  I\u2019m sure I probably annoy her, too, but our parents really want us to spend time together so we have forced family activity time weekly.\n\nThe problem is that our skill levels are really mismatched on most things and it\u2019s causing problems. I pick up things pretty quickly, so usually most games I have the hang of after a few rounds and I\u2019m an athlete so anything physical is easier for me. I also just like learning new things and challenges anyway so maybe I\u2019ve learned how to learn better, idk.  Jenna is a lot slower, not as fit with physical stuff, and just doesn\u2019t pick up things easily.  So, like with hiking, we always have to do the slow easiest trails so Jenna can keep up. With board games, we have to go back over the rules so often games take forever and there\u2019s no challenge in it. It seems like no matter what it is, she\u2019s lagging and frustrated and I\u2019m bored and restless from holding back. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s doing anyone any good, I\u2019m not having fun having to do the bunny slope version of everything and she\u2019s not having fun comparing herself to me.\n\nI\u2019ve told my mom and step-dad but they insist it\u2019s important for us to \u201cbond\u201d and they say I just need to be more patient with Jenna.  Over Christmas, we went ice skating and it turned into a huge deal because neither of us had skated before but I watched some other people and then fell a few times, but got the hang of it while Jenna barely stayed upright and ended up stomping off crying. So I told our parents alone later that I don\u2019t want to do these outings with Jenna anymore and if they make me go I\u2019m not participating because everyone feels bad.\n\nMy step-dad said I just need to do things with her that she\u2019s good at. I asked \u201cWhat is she good at?\u201d because I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019d do it if I did.  That pissed him off and he went off about how I look down on her and try to make her look bad, but he didn\u2019t answer the question.\n\nSo now Jenna is moody and depressed, step-dad is mad, my mom is irritated because I\u2019ve stopped participating in family time, and idk what I did wrong. My older brother (22M) says step-dad doesn\u2019t even know what she\u2019s good at and he\u2019s mad he couldn\u2019t answer, but my brother doesn\u2019t like them so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "created_utc": 1672948357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1048am7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_activities_with_my/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't you guys go to the movies or something \ud83d\ude44 that everyone can do? \nThey are setting you guys up for failure and hostility, not bonding. Why doesn't Jenna pick an activity?", "You asked a legitimate question. Unless your presentation was sarcastic, NTA. The solution may be having a conversation with Jenna to let her know that you aren't trying to make her feel bad, and you are sorry if she feels that way, and see if you can come to some kind of understanding where you don't have to hold back, and she doesn't take it personally (I know, but try anyway), then throw in suggestions for things you enjoy that you can each do at your own pace. How about go-cart racing?", "NTA I don't get why so many y t a and e s h. In such situation I would also ask what OP asked, the step sister choose 6 of 10 from the activities and neither has fun. If that's what bonding means I personally would pass and why should they bond?", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have to slow your pace for her sake. And she shouldn't be forced to do things at your pace either. That's not good for her or her mental health. You are two different people and should be treated as such. It feels like stepdad is trying to force her to be more like you. Jenna should be  given a chance and space from the forced togetherness (which helps no one and just breeds resentment) to do her own thing. I bet she would flourish then, if doing things she likes and under no pressure to do them the same way that you do. Stepdad shouldn't force the relationship. He should leave you two to bond organically and maybe with time, you will find something that you have in common with her and enjoy doing together.\n\nEdited.", "Honestly? The real assholes here are your parents. Forced bonding doesn't work. They need to allow you girls to find common ground on your own. \n\nForcing you to hold back, is not fair to you,and it makes you resent her. The fact that you pick up in things better than she does, ultimately humiliates her and she ends up resenting you. No one wins here. \n\nI would try and ask her what she enjoys doing. Maybe you'll find that you both really like a TV show or Movie or go for some food together. Bonding doesn't have to happen with things that require being athletic or board games. Sometimes bonding is finding out that the other person likes the same Chinese food place that you like so sometimes you eat there together. \nTry other things and keep in mind that everyone here is doing what they think is best. Go easy on her and on yourself.\n\nNo judgement from me. Just some advice.", "INFO: Are you planning on showing this thread to your parents? I think they need a wake up call. I really feel bad for Jenna in all of this and your parents solutions are making everything worse. Are you all in family therapy (THIS IS A MUST)?  \n\n\nI think they need to let Jenna find her own feet with people she chooses vs forcing the two of you to bond when you clearly have very different skill levels and things you enjoy, and yeah, people are not equal at all things and having her try to learn something new only to always be overshadowed by you (sounds like you realize this so you're no AH really) is just ruining it for her. Going NTA but Jenna needs some better help or she's going to crash hard and your parents are doing the opposite of what needs to be done.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s ridiculous to make you bond with a stranger or do anything you don\u2019t want to do for that matter.", "NTA. your brother is right. Furthermore your forced family time is stupid and probably some psychological projection of your step-dads inability to have a functioning traditional family rather than your current blended family situation. It's pretty common.", "Definitely NTA, neither one of the kids are. The parents need some help understanding forcing a stepsibling bond to happen is not the best way to blend the family. \n\nAfter reading all your comments, I see that you genuinely wants to know what she's good at so that you all can do that. Also, I think it was tactful to have that conversation separately with the parents.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmake it video evenings. **Nobody is bad at watching a film.** And alternate with selecting the films.", "NTA, but maybe you can have a talk with Jenna, leave your brother, mom, step-dad, out of it. Ask her what she enjoys doing. I saw where you said she chose some of the outings, she may just be choosing those types because it seems like what everyone else likes. Maybe do a day that isn't the whole entire family being forced to bond, just try and spend time with her, without there being a game, sport, etc. I will say, it's a bit rude to imply she isn't good at anything, because she may be great at something, that you may not be, it just sounds like the activities being picked isn't her strong suit. Your parents aren't doing any good with this, and it's likely hurting and upsetting Jenna. They need to start allowing and/or suggesting things like movie nights, spa nights, etc. Something everyone can do and get into.", "ESH\n\nThis sounds like torture and not bonding time so your parents should knock it off. You could have been more tactful. Has anyone ever asked her how she feels about this forced torture time or what she would like to spend her time doing while counting down the minutes until she is as free of you as you are of her?", "Have you asked Jenna what she would like to do in these family times? Maybe she'd like to bake, or paint, or make up limericks. Who is deciding on the activities? Perhaps you and Jenna need to take over the planning. Just a thought. As it is, it sounds awful for everyone. NTA, but maybe extend an olive branch without the parents involved and see what happens.", "It's pretty clear that the options given for bonding time aren't working.  It always ends with you outperforming Jenna and her upset that she's behind.  \n\nYou've brought this up with the parents, yet they just don't do anything, only tell you to be patient with Jenna, even though that didn't end well either.\n\nBecause of your comment, \"What is she good at?\", it's a bit hard to decide on whether this is an NTA or ESH because it's a harsh comment, but it's clear that for the most part, you're not in the wrong.", "NAH and they will all get over it. Her dad is also frustrated bc he wants his daughter to shine in something, anything, really. But it's clear she doesn't and that's ok.\n\nYou, my golden girl, have to be patient a little more and maybe find a compromise solution, but leave the parents out of this discussion that you need to have with your step sister. Team up together to do activities that doesn't involve them. Let me give you some ideas: going to the beach, you can swim or do whatever athletic stuff while she's reading a book or just sunbathing. Or what I was doing with my cousin, we were going clubbing together, but except for him bringing me a beer every hour and to check on me, we didn't actually interact. He was even chaperoning while I was casually smooching his best friend \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Or you could go on a city trip together without the parents, drop her where she wants and you do you. Your parents will be happy that there's a complicity between you two, that's all they ask.\n\nYou might be surprised to find out there's a quality to everyone regardless of their IQ and if she is nice with you, you'll have a blast.", "YTA maybe she is better at being nice? You can try to help her out a bit. She is not always around I think.. you sound kinda arrogant to me..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why are adults constantly requesting you complete if your skills are so miss matched.  Stop judging her without knowing her.  Ask HER what she likes.", "ESH. Part of being in a family is making concessions for each other. There's always going to be someone who needs more accommodation. But at the same time, it's not healthy that every activity has to be the whole family, especially if one person is getting to pick most of them and set the pace.

She is your younger sister so of course she isn't as good as you and doesn't have the same interests but your parents are correct spending time together is about being together not about being the best at everything. It is possible your parents can potentially find better activities where the skill difference isn't as much of an issue. There are lots of ways to potentially handle it aside from skipping family time. Your parents definitely need to work better at understanding your concerns and coming up with a solution rather than just getting irritated at you. That doesn't help.", "YTA I'm perfect and my stepsister not is such a  bratty attitude.  People learn at there own rate if you let her grasp.somthing once she fi ay.has it maybe you'd have  a bond.

I know you may have been asking a genuine question, but it def comes across as questioning your step-sister\u2019s capabilities esp given how you\u2019ve described her in earlier parts of your post. \n\nI get how you and others can get frustrated when you have to repeat instructions or constantly try to find different activities to fit different people\u2019s needs, but I think it would help to understand that everyone\u2019s different and everyone learns at a different pace even if they\u2019re close to the same age. So a little patience, sympathy, and maybe a little encouragement can go a long way in helping your step sis next time in some of the activities. I\u2019m almost certain your step sis can feel the tension and frustration that others feel and that could make her doubt her abilities and interests which can explain why, when asked, she wouldn\u2019t know what she\u2019d wanna do. This same tension/frustration can also make her feel even more anxious or self conscious ab learning new things which can affect how she learns. Obviously idk her but I\u2019ve seen it in my sis too growing up. She couldn\u2019t pick up things as quickly but it wasn\u2019t cuz she wasn\u2019t smart or incapable but cuz she just learns differently and with the proper guidance and encouragement, she\u2019s thriving now. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sure the both of you are still adjusting to new step life, so it\u2019s okay to not want to constantly spend time with your new family members.
