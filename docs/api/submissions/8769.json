Discharge them from your practice and tell them you will be happy to send their records along to whoever they like.\n\nI work at a doctor's practice as an admin. I've been *threatened*  with \"I'll be leaving this practice\" by some of our short-tempered patients when things don't go as planned or when the doctor refuses to prescribe certain meds... I'm always thinking \"Please don\"t threaten me with a good thing.\"", "True, I agree she shouldn't have to deal with it... but no clients, no money.  Gotta pay the bills.  As much as it sux, gotta deal with rude people unless you are rich.  Then you pay people to deal with the rude people.", "My best friend is a primary care doc. She has no say in the length of her appointments. It\u2019s all set by the health system she works in. She is often late because their time frames are unrealistic for many appointments. \n\nI also personally never mind when doctors are running late because I have been the patient who needed extra time. One time they couldn\u2019t find my daughter\u2019s heartbeat, requiring an emergency ultrasound. They had to pull an OB to do that who also had her own appointments and my appointment took 40 minutes instead of the 10 or so it usually takes. I never once felt like I wasn\u2019t their main focus, and I have always really appreciated it. When I had PPD, I also had a very long appointment discussing the issues I was having. Again, my CNM was so patient and understanding and got me hooked up with some great resources and meds. So I try to always be patient with mine since I know the kinds of things they\u2019re experiencing. I also always call and check if I\u2019m going to be a few minutes late though. It doesn\u2019t happen most times, but every once in awhile I get stuck in traffic. I always call to see if they want me to reschedule. I would never throw a fit if a doctor couldn\u2019t fit me in because of it.", "Depending on the type of visit, certain times are applied\u2014a sick visit gets 15 minutes, a physical gets 45 (New England, USA). However, there\u2019s no buffer time. So my doctor family member will have an 11 and an 11:15, for example. No time between to allow for anything. I get frustrated with them, because the practice treats medical issues as money makers vs. helping people. So if they do their job the way they should, they end up running super late. The place refuses to change appointment times or how they schedule (I know because I\u2019ve asked those people directly, probably why my partner doesn\u2019t take me to events anymore \ud83d\ude06). It\u2019s infuriating on multiple levels\u2014I commiserate with the patients, but I\u2019m also waiting hours beyond time for my partner to get home, and they\u2019re only in family practice. Yeah, I know I\u2019m with a doctor, but these private practices don\u2019t seem to value either the practitioner or the patient.", "> Why is a doctor\u2019s time more important than mine?\n\nBecause doctors keep people alive.  What do you do for a job?", "Yep, my OB ran 45 minutes late at a minimum. But, when you were with her, you had 100% of her attention. So, I knew that's how she rolled and planned accordingly. It was worth it to me because she was a fantastic doctor, I trusted her and she always put me at ease.\n\nHowever, now that my pregnancy days are over, I switched to another provider in her practice who is also great but doesn't do OB, just GYN, and I wait maybe 10 minutes max for my appointment.", "When will the time slot of an appointment be shared? Why do I pay hundreds of dollars for 30 minutes without being told I only have 30 minutes? And why do I spend 3 hours there total, at least an hour alone in the room if I only have a 30 minute slot? I show up early, wait an hour, get moved to a room, wait another hour, see a nurse, then wait some more,hopefully see someone above a nurse but typically still only see an RN my whole visit? Pretty much every appointment I've ever been to, including my two inductions as an in-patient. At 2 different hospitals.", "Problem is, I have regularly been called in 10-15 minutes past my scheduled time when my appointment was at the latest at 9am. Afternoon appointments are worse, they easily run 45 minutes late. \n\nOnce, I had an appointment where I happened to have disappeared from the schedule. And that one I found out after waiting for a very long time, and the nurse came asking who I was there for...\n\nCan't change doctor's, because these are the only ones in walking distance.", "Yes \nAnd everywhere is like America\u2026.", "I have chronic health issues and I have never experienced that or anything remotely close to that at any of my doctors. There is no reason to show up more than 10-15 minutes before an appointment. \n\nI've never sat in an exam room more than 10 minutes waiting for the doctor after being brought in and assessed by the nurse, NP or PA. My appointments are always for either 15 or 30 minutes. If I need bloods, the nurse comes back at the end of my appointment.\n\nWhy are you paying hundreds of dollars for a doctor visit? Why would you think you have more than a 30 min appointment. 30 min is actually a long time.", "You act like doctors can set their own appointment times. In my area they can\u2019t. Appointment times are set by the healthcare system they\u2019re working in. They cannot modify them. It sucks and they all hate it from my experience.", "Well, then this particular doctor should extend his available appointment times. Since he's going to stay late anyway, all of the time, why not formalize his ACTUAL work time to keep patients from unnecessary wait times?", "Well darn. It's every office in my area, and I've been to most because of these issues. I typically only ever go in for work/school notes and need antibiotics, if even that. It always takes hours and then I have issues with getting my notes and medication too. It's the same for my kids. Even had to resubmit samples(like kids diaper for colli and other things) because they got tossed by the person I handed them to once. It's so infuriating and I've never gotten any answers about it.", "Why?  Why should the doctor change the way he practices to match what other people, or you in particular, want?  He seems to be doing his job the way he wants to. If a patient doesn\u2019t like how he practices then they can find a new doctor. If the doctor is good enough then the wait will be worth it. If he isn\u2019t a good enough doctor, then the situation will sort itself out.", "I think the point is that if he knows that he's always going to be late, then realistically he should change the lengths of his appointments to match or not book as many people.", "YTA.  Medical professionals aggravate me... if the patient is running 15-20 minutes late, that's unacceptable.  However, if the doctor is running 15-20 minutes late, the patient is expected to wait.  My doctor would charge me $15 if I was over 15 minutes late (policy on the wall... I was never late); however, she kept me waiting 45 minutes on a regular basis.", "NTA- they\u2019re always late which means they never respected your time! You don\u2019t need patients who are going to purposely be late then make you the bad person! Great job to sticking to what you believe and that patient will realize how most people don\u2019t accept that at all!", "Lmao NTA at all", "NTA. Maybe they need to schedule the appt for 15 minutes later than they think they\u2019ll get there if they\u2019re always 15 min late.", "NTA- If a patient's appt is at 1pm and they call to tell you they'll be late, they can possibly get worked into the schedule later that day. Last appointment of the day? Forget it. No one is staying open past regular hours for someone who wants to show up that late.", "NTA. They are always late huh? Sounds like you dodged a massive bullet.\nWho TF wants to wait around for someone intentionally being late. Because at this point they admitted they knew they were always late and just expect everyone else to deal with them", "NTA\n\nThey are always running late, which means they don't respect your time, or anyone else's.", "NTA my clinic would have done the same thing.", "NTA.\n\nBeing on time is basic courtesy, no matter what type of appointment it is. Your former patient is not courteous, and will not be a loss to your practice. Given the shortage of providers, you will have a willing patient ready to take their place in a hot second.", "NTA - It is not a doctors responsibility to put the rest of their life on hold because a patient is late. You did what you could and tried to accomodate them without having to sacrifice your night", "NTA\n\nYou dodged a bullet. Your time is valuable", "What's an APP?", "NTA, but what is an APP?", "Def NTA. My clinic does not have a late policy (corporate owned practice) and they ask that providers accommodate late patients. That being said I have to pick up my kids so if the last patient of the day is late I can't stay. I do my best to run on time so I feel like that's very fair.", "NTA. She's showing absolutely no respect for you, and I think it's best she doesn't want to be your patient, so you won't have to deal with that crap. My doctor's office has a hard 8 minutes late and they won't see you cut off, and you may not get another appointment for a month. You're being generous.", "NTA -  \u2018I\u2019m always late\u2019.      \nWTF ?        \nIf you\u2019re always late learn to manage your time better.      \nYou don\u2019t make others late because of you.", "NTA but I find it extremely ironic that a doctor is a stickler about anything \u201con time\u201d. Never once has one of my appointments not resulted in me being seen 30 mins to an hour after the scheduled time.", "NTA\n\nI get such bad anxiety when I think I\u2019m going to be late or even \u2018on time\u2019 to an appointment. I show up always at least 15-10 minutes before. \n\nIf I\u2019m late if with affect the person I\u2019m seeing, other workers and the appointments after mine for potentially the rest of the day.", "You dodged a bullet. They are admittedly \"always late\". They expect you to value their time but refuse to value yours. NTA.", "Okay I don\u2019t get this - why make an appt and expect people to come early? Why not just expect them to come at the appt time and have the dr plan on walking in 15 min later?", "Why doesn\u2019t your primary just make the appts for 20 minutes earlier? Why is your expected arrival time different then your appt time?? So weird\n\nETA if drs want me at a specific time they should schedule me at that time!", "Man. I wish all I had was a 30 min wait.\nMost drs also have rounds at hospitals so it\u2019s not unusual for an 1hr or more wait.\nWe also have a massive dr shortage so we are just happy to see a dr at all.", "It is NOT the doctors fault for \"always running behind\" poor families use one person's visits to ask questions about all their sick kids to avoid expensive bills. Two another person's problems could actually be a LOT worse than what they had assumed before their Doctor told them otherwise. We had an appointment at 3:15 for my daughter, we weren't seen until after 5pm, which was WELL beyond their offices closing time. Why? Because we knew their was a baby that had gone in before us and apperently something was a lot more majorly wrong with the baby than even the parents had anticipated. this is seriously super common all over the place.", "Relatedly, a lot of medical practices do what's called \"wave scheduling\", where two or three patients are booked to the same time slot and taken in the order they arrive.\n\nFor example, if each patient takes about 15 minutes of the doctor's time, two patients might be booked each half hour slot. If one patient arrives on time or a little early and the other arrives 10-15 minutes late, then the punctual one can get seen first (ideally at the scheduled appointment time) and the late one can still be seen when they arrive without disrupting the doctor's schedule for the rest of the day.\n\nWhere this runs into problems is if both patients show up on time and one of them gets stuck waiting an extra 15 minutes. Or longer, if the doctor falls behind schedule before the appointment slot.", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s they want people there early enough to figure out any insurance issues and get info updated. I also work in healthcare and sometimes it takes forever just getting people checked in (most who show up right on time or late) because they don\u2019t have their insurance with them or their insurance has issues.", "If you literally can't properly conceive of time it doesn't have anything to do with other people. That's my point.", "Parents were both Drs before they retired. They would book a usual amount of time to see a patient. Even know patients who would run extra time would block them out a second or more time slots. Sometimes nothing they did could stop a patient or spouse running an appointment late. Some patients had an hour booked slot out for them. Didn\u2019t always matter", "I usually think that if a doctor is running late, it's probably because he is listening to his patient and not running them out the door.  So I can live with that.\n\nThe one time I got upset, I was the last patient in the waiting room, had already been waiting some time past my appointment time, and the doc decided to take his half an hour lunch break.  I understood he wanted a break, but since it was already after my appointment time, couldn't he see me, then take his lunch?  Then instead of me having to wait a considerable amount of time past my appointment already, THEN for another half an hour, he could have seen me, taken his break, and then the afternoon patients would have been a bit late for their appointment, but not nearly as late as I was.  Waiting an extra 10 minutes for his break would not have impacted him nearly as much as it impacted me having to wait another half an hour on top of the time I had already waited.", "Because they are the fucking dr? You need them. They have plenty of patients besides you.", "This is such a spot on comment that I swear you've worked at my practice.", "This is where doctors have to not be so greedy.  They need to say to the insurance companies that they cannot be on time because they\u2019re scheduling too many people per hour And that it\u2019s not fair to the patients to make them wait.  All it takes is for them to speak up and have a few less patients each day\u2026", "You can schedule an extra 5 minute gap between every second appointment but patients will still show up late or need more time than what is scheduled making doctors run behind. I work in obstetrical office where the doctors see 20-28 patients a day yet patents still get angry when they call for an appointment and our first available is in 3 weeks. My docs already work 9-11 hour days and eat lunch at their desk while documenting their morning", "It\u2019s not as if doctors are just barely eking out a living!  They\u2019re not scraping by to pay their bills like probably 85% of their patients!", "Yep by double or triple booking.  Many years ago, I scheduled an appointment with a doctor.  When I scheduled it, I asked for the very first appointment of the day.  The day comes.  I arrive 15 minutes before my appointment.  Then wait for 75 minutes to be seen.  turned out the doctor had  six 9:00 appointments and I was the 5th 9:00 appointment of the day.  So disrespectful.  I gave her a piece of my mind at the end of the appointment and never went back.", "If all doctors spoke up and refused to schedule so many appointments, the insurance companies would have to give in.  Don\u2019t tell me doctors have no say in these matters!", "I can say for sure that they are trying. Unfortunately, the doctors can\u2019t just refuse because they don\u2019t do their own schedule in the system we have here. It\u2019s all done through a central office, which they also hate. Affecting change is not always easy. My school district went on strike this past August just to get things like functioning HVAC units in our buildings.", "I mean... that's what happened in this particular case. The doctor lost a patient because he was always very late.\n\nWhy should a doctor try and keep appointments when they are scheduled? Hmm... gee.. maybe basic customer service? Or the desire to have a well-run office where a bunch of patients aren't coughing on each other while waiting forever in the waiting room?"]}
