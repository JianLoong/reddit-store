On this occasion, they were running late and thankfully had the courtesy to let you know but unfortunately you couldn't accommodate this lateness, so you made arrangements for them to be offered alternative appointments the next day/week depending on when worked for them.

That person has so normalized making people wait on her that it is not only a demand but one she sees as perfectly reasonable.  Your practice policy regarding appointment times is essentially the terms and conditions of providing service as accepted by the people who make appointments there. I would sincerely hope that the practice would not accomodate her but rather say: We are happy to reassign you to another provider when you are uncomfortable for any reason. However, we cannot endorse your complaint that your assigned provider was unable to stay more than 20 minutes beyond scheduled time to complete an appointment for which YOU were late. \n\nOP's proper response to all of this is to simply smile and say, \"ok, thank you.\" Because you now have one less entitled narcissist to needlessly sap your energy on a recurring basis. \n\nIf this patient is consistent in this behavior then she will find herself eventually pushed/drawn towards whatever provider will put up with her. Perhaps one that runs sufficiently chronically late that they just synch up better.\n\nThis whole thing just cracks me up as I imagine the call for an appointment, \"Hi, yes, I would like an appointment with whichever provider is mostly likely to be running late as I, too, will be running late so it'll just work out better for everybody if we get that part out of the way up front.\"", "NTA.\n\nThis patient is very self-righteous about his or her lateness.

Takes a lot of nerve when someone who describes themself as chronically late tells you that you need to extend your office hours to accommodate their selfishness.
