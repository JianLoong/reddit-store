Because he made more money that way.", "Why don't you? Is their time more valuable than yours? I have to take off work to go to an appointment. I plan ahead so that I don't inconvenience my coworkers while I'm gone. I'm not talking about when emergencies happen and they get a bit behind. This was every single appt. Even if we were on the early morning appts. Spending 20 extra minutes chatting about non-medical garbage isn't helpful.", ">And my point is - if you want the patient to be there for paperwork 15 minutes before the time you have allotted in the doc's schedule, then that's the time you set the appointment for.   Include that paperwork time in the appointment - it's an \"office apppointment\"  instead of a \"doctor appointment\".\n>\n>Say the doc's open slot is at 10:15. The patient would be told show up at the set time of 10:00, spend 15 minutes on paperwork, then see the doc at 10:15. \n>\n\n\n\n\nThat is assuming everyone can fill out the paperwork in that amount of time and in the correct way. Providers only have 15 minutes to assess and chart on a follow up appointment, with maybe 30 minutes for a new consult/establishing care appointment. This is also assuming the provider sticks to the allotted time. If the provider runs behind with another patient, everything crumbles and people are again waiting for their appointment. Some cases are way more complex than the reason why they came into clinic! \n\n\n\n\nI agree, the system is flawed and dumb. **On your next patient satisfaction survey please note this complaint on the survey!**  (If you're in the USA). Negative comments are reviewed by corporate,  and they are the ones who created this ridiculous system to cram in as many people as possible into an 8 hour day to generate as much revenue as possible! Your time as the patient is valuable,  just as it is for the provider.", "My psychiatrist I only see 4 times a year is consistently late and I can tell it's from chattiness because I try to keep my sessions to the point of what's new in my life, how the medication is going, if I have any health concerns, please call in my refill, thank you, I'll make an appt with the desk.  Tho sometimes I have the first appointment of the day and he'll be 15 minutes late.", "There are over 330 million people in this country. And only 91,000 GPs. You do the math.", "It\u2019s not always your time vs their time - it\u2019s someone else\u2019s time/health vs yours and your physicians need to have breaks\u2026 but also yes, your doctor\u2019s time is likely more important than your time - it\u2019s actually why often times there are ways to schedule private appointments for general care/home visits at a higher costs. This even follows in countries with socialized care - you either way/accept some inconveniences or you pay more to avoid them because your is extremely valuable. \n\nReally your doctor likely doesn\u2019t want you waiting around an excessively long time more than you want to be there - just that it\u2019s not uncommon for shit to come up/for them to be digging themselves out from a pile of late appointments that stack up throughout the day/possibly for them to have pretty limited ability to change how their appointments are scheduled even if they dislike it. \n\nI also work with a ton of clinicians in my career and I can almost guarantee they will either be late or have to cancel any given meeting because of how often something urgent comes up with a patient (I work primarily with specialists across a variety of fields of medicine). Shoot, even in general care something like a patient passing out or presenting particularly concerning symptoms can take up a lot of time - even if that time is just transferring someone to another clinic\u2019s care. People with more urgent or critical needs come up pretty dang often, to the point where it should almost be expected. \n\nIt sucks having to wait and ideally it would always be an avoidable issue, it also sucks that many offices and clinicians are poor at communicating on delays. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s also fully possible your doctor is just an asshole taking 45 minute coffee breaks every hour, but that\u2019s probably less likely. \n\nAll I can really say is do telehealth when you can - my experience is those appointments usually stay relatively on schedule and otherwise I\u2019ve usually found early morning appointments are more likely to stay on schedule, for routine care for medical issues I actually request that I always try to be scheduled for the first or earliest possible appt for the day because I hate waiting around.", "Usually doctors and clinics can\u2019t afford buffer time!", "Exactly.

A family member is a doctor, and she said this when I asked about the lateness problem. Lots of people who come in for an annual checkup, and in the last two minutes say something like \"oh hey while I'm here, I've been pissing blood for 3 months, is that like normal or whatever?\" Or, her favorite, an old woman brings her husband in for a check up and then says \"now that that's over, doctor, you need to look this thing on him, because he won't see a doctor on his own.\" And the man grumbles, lifts up his shirt, and there's a HUGE growth that requires booking follow ups.\n\nInsurance acts like people are rational actors about their health, because then it's easy to profit by squeezing as many patients into a day as possible.

Managed care practices dictate how many patients a provider is to see per hour and the intervals at which patients are scheduled.

And if he does that with each and every patient, then he will run behind.\n\nCurrent fee schedules from insurance companies don't really allow for this type of care.  Insurance companies pay pennies on the dollar for what is billed by the clinic. Unless he runs a cash-based clinic, he has to see a large number of patients to keep the lights on in the clinic, pay his mortgage, pay his loans, etc etc.\n\nLong story short, insurance companies are the devil, and it's 99% of the time a patient issue.", "It's just not feasible with the broken American healthcare system.  \n\nFor a clinic that relies on patients with insurance, the doctor won't get paid enough money to pay his bills if he does 45-minute appointments so he doesn't get behind his schedule.
