{"id": 11799, "submission_id": "11m36hj", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter who eloped cash for her honeymoon?", "selftext": "My daughter Jane recently eloped with her partner of 5 years. My wife and I were excited when they got engaged to plan a wedding but she said she didn't want to rush setting a date or planning a wedding. This was understandable to us and we didn't want to rush them either, but we let her know we would contribute a set amount to her wedding when the time came. Then last week she tells me she has an announcement and that they actually eloped together because they decided they didn't want the big event with all the attention on them. This was a little disappointing but we understood, she's never been the type to want to be the spotlight so while we weren't expecting it, it wasn't the biggest shock in the world.\n\nWhat did feel like a shock is when she assumed we'd just give her that amount of cash straight up. She said they wanted to use it to take a month long traveling sabbatical/honeymoon. My wife and I told her the money we were prepared to give her was for a family event, not just for her to do as she pleases. If she didn't want a traditialy wedding, thats fine but we never told her we were just giving her say 15k for the act of getting married. We just didn't want her to have to spend a ton of her own funds on a wedding and since relatives and family friends would have presumably been there, we were happy to pay for it so she wouldn't have to. 2 of my nieces have gotten married in the last couple years and its a family event to us, not just about the two people getting married.  This has caused a whole thing with her saying we went back on our word to her but in my mind we never told her otherwise. We did say if she wants a second ceremony/family event to celebrate but wouldn't be an official wedding, we would sponsor that.\n\nIf she had asked if she eloped or had a tiny wedding if we would give her some of it for a honeymoon, we may have considered it but its hard to know because we were never given the request, they just went and did their own thing (Which again is fine).

The elopement negated the family aspect of it.", "Did you promise her money \u201cwhen she got married\u201d when she was younger or did you explicitly say \u201cfor a wedding\u201d because a lot of parents come back with this when kids elope and the kids are surprised because they assumed that their parents would be HAPPIER giving them the money directly to start their lives than \u201cwasting it\u201d shelling out for a wedding/party, so really you need to consider your next steps if you want to keep the peace.", "NTA,\n\nBut it's a hard situation because of this misaligned expectation.\n\nI would personally try to make sure she acknowledges your point, and if you can afford, contribute a bit to her honeymoon out of goodwill and as a way of showing support.\n\nIt may be a very emotional moment for her and she might have been counting on your money when making plans, so trying to find a compromise here would be good for your relationship.", "NTA.  You were offering to throw a party.\n\nBut sliding at least a portion of that money her way would probably smooth the road quite a bit, if you have the means and if you have other children you will give a wedding for", "Idk I feel this is manipulative. I mean you don\u2019t have to give her money but be prepare for you to lose your daughter. I don\u2019t think she will forgive this that easily. She wanted something small for her and her husband. I think a honeymoon is actually better then stressing over a wedding to please others. I feel sad for your daughter because I don\u2019t think she elope to be rude but to have money for a good honeymoon where she could enjoy it. I do hope she has amazing in-laws that can help them out.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money and you said you\u2019d help contribute to a wedding, not that you\u2019d gift her money.", "NTA Actually, a wedding is about the couple, but it\u2019s fair of you to say the event would be so that the family could celebrate the couple. Your daughter is acting entitled.", "It is your money to do with as you see fit but you do sort of make it sound like not giving her this money now is as a punishment for her not having the wedding you wanted her to have.", "What you said make sense. Wedding cost money with more people and you would willingly to help some but now they didn\u2019t have the wedding, there\u2019s no need to help.

And while that may have been the best decision for you, it does not mean that your decision did not hurt your mother and I as well as the rest of this family.*\n\n*I will never get to walk my daughter down the aisle.  Your mother will never get to go wedding dress shopping with her daughter.  We will never get to see our child get married.

You disappointed the both of us.  And we are allowed to be disappointed.*\n\n*But what you don't get to do is re-write history.  We told you we would contribute to your wedding.  You chose to not have a wedding.  You chose to not include your family.  You chose to put yourself before your mother and I.  And we have made peace with that decision.  Like I said, we are hurt and disappointed, but it is your life and we respect your right to choose.*\n\n*But what you don't get to do is act like WE let you down.  Because we didn't.

That's why it's a gift. You are in control with what your money is spent on. \n\nThats being said and out of the way, how would you feel if your own parent ignored a major life step you took? Possibly instead of giving your daughter a huge lump sum of cash  if you're opposed or it would harm your financial situation,  give her a small gift at least. Something for her household , bookshelf, or garden even.\n\nExpecting cash is always presumptuous but wanting acknowledgement isn't.  I speak from personal experience , since I also eloped.  Not only did lack acknowledgement a wedding took place sting but every ignored anniversary since stings. I'm from a family where everyone is at least sent a card for those.", "NTA Your money and you already told her it was for a wedding that didn't happen.

Maybe you two could've come to an agreement on it had you known they wanted to elope privately", "NTA It feels a bit entitled that she surprise eloped and then still expected the money, especially to take a MONTH LONG vacation. Very excessive when not using your own money, imo. Like you said, if she would have come to you before getting married and laid it all out there then maybe you could have compromised/given her a smaller amount as a wedding gift or something. It kind of seems like a \"it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission\" type situation where she was hoping you'd just give in. My parents paid for my wedding, and if I eloped I wouldn't have had the balls to ask my parents for the money they would have spent.", "NTA.\n\nYour money was for a wedding, she chose not to do that, which is her right.  But she doesn't get to just decide that the money is now for something else.", "NAH, it's a tricky situation. I'd give her some of the money as a wedding gift, so she can use it towards her honeymoon. Not giving anything would seem like you want to punish her and might sour your relationship going forward.", "NTA", "YTA. Your daughter decided to be sensible, and you want to punish her for it?", "You made it clear that you would be able to contribute a set amount to a wedding that family could attend and enjoy.

Not even close.", "**NTA.** You and your wife offering to contribute toward wedding expenses in no way means your daughter is somehow entitled to that money if a wedding does not take place. That's just entitlement on your daughter's end.", "NTA\n\nThe money was to be used to host a wedding. They eloped, which is lovely, and I'm sure you'll give them a wedding gift, but assuming they would receive something like $15K intended to host a big wedding for family to do with as they pleased is presumptuous.", "NTA.

There's a difference in spending so much money for an event a whole lot of people would enjoy than giving it for 2 people only to spend. \n\nShe didn't spend a penny because she eloped, I'm sure she has all the money for a good honeymoon without you giving her anything.", "NTA\n\nYour money, your choice on how to spend it. \n\nYou said you'd help pay for a wedding, you didn't say you had money to just give them as a gift.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But OP offered to pitch in for the WEDDING and they were not even aware the new plan until she went and assumed they would give her the money still. OP even said that had she asked beforehand they would have considered giving some of the money for the honeymoon. Weddings cost significantly more than vactions so the daughter honestly wouldn't need as much money as what was originally offered.
