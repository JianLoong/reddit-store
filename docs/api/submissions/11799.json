I would say to go ahead and reimburse her for the court fees, but that would probably just make her angrier.", "NTA!", "NAH. I think it's a bit shitty that your money is conditional on a wedding when A) weddings can be absurdly expensive, and B) not everybody wants to deal with the time, expense, stress, etc. of planning and hosting a wedding. \n\nPerhaps your daughter shouldn't have assumed she'd get money for a honeymoon if they didn't have a traditional wedding. That said, a honeymoon is a very marriage-centric activity, so it's understandable that she would assume they could use the promised wedding money on something related to their nuptials. \n\nClearly neither of you had your expectations met here. It might be worth you, your wife, and your daughter having a conversation about that.", "NTA.  I eloped too.  We didn't expect gifts from people for getting married tho.

If I wasn't buying a crib, I would have made the baby gift much smaller.  It was the same for my daughter when she was in university. I offered to pay for her books but she bought used books for less. This was a great choice but I didn't give her the difference between the new book price and the used book price.

We got marked last year and my biggest takeaway is that the event was basically a family event. It was a way for us to communicate our new status (married) to our communities.

It could be that the daughter has seen this in her own circle and made an unfair assumption that her parents would be offering the same. \n\nThat being said, no one in my friend group necessarily had an expectation to be gifted the money in this way- it\u2019s just what ended up being a common thread between us in what was offered.", "My uncle was the same and all his kids had big weddings\ud83e\udd23", "Stop comparing your parents giving you a handout to OP\u2019s situation.

We would have eloped, but I had a small wedding instead because I'm the only one of my parent's children who will likely get married in their lifetime. It was a small, measured affair with the intention of making both families feel comfortable and give them the opportunity to enjoy it.\n\nIn western culture, the expenses of the celebrations being on the parents were exactly for this reason - the couple couldn't afford to get family together as young, just starting out folks, so the parents would put on the party for the friends and family to enjoy. People would get married in their best clothes, regardless of the color of them, and weddings themselves weren't in event venues or special destinations, they were at your home church, with a reception at their event hall or at a local restaurant.\n\nThe advent of the actual wedding industry and the rising cost of weddings actually started somewhere between the 1920-1950s, so it's not really cultural given that it was invented in our grandparent's lifetimes. The financial accessibility of magazines and print media with photos and movies started bringing celebrity weddings to the common people, and what they had only read about in newspapers suddenly became something they could see executed in images. 1940s saw Debeers kicking off the most successful cultural campaign to sell diamonds, introducing the concept of engagement rings, telling people it had to be a diamond, and then telling people that diamond has to be at least 3 months salary or you don't love your girl.\n\nThe actual culturally relevant parts of the wedding, which is a gathering of families to celebrate the union of the bride and groom as paid for by the bride and grooms parents, have gone to the wayside in lieu of creating a commercialized wedding of your dreams fully manufactured by every business that could figure out how to make a dollar off you.", "And I, and many others, fully disagree with your assessment.\n\nIn point of fact if you study the historical record it's obvious that all weddings, everywhere, have ALWAYS been about the families who are uniting through the marriage at least as much, and often more so, then the couple in questions' union. In most of the world this is still very much the case. It is only in the very narrow time and place (now, the West) in which this couple is marrying that this is even a question.\n\nAs JustNoLikeWhoa points out this is ESPECIALLY TRUE when the families are footing of the bill but even now the wedding is a family event- even in the West - a wedding is only partially about the couple but also the joining of the two families (blood and chosen) in question. Giving them a chance to know each other because, as a family, folks will be sharing space and possible genetic relations if things go according to many people's plans.  And for many of us we are also accepting someone into our tribe who we are taking on some level of obligation toward and thus they need getting to know.

In the other, it's a family event.", "Welll, acckkkssshhhuuaaaalllly. \n\nJust shut up man. Weddings are often very much a family event depending on the customs and culture and many other factors.

I have always been of the opinion that my children will get a large cash contribution when they get married and they can choose to use it on a wedding or on a down payment for a house or something else. Either way the amount will be the same.  I can't be the only one with this perspective so I can definitely see how misunderstandings could have occurred. That is not to say that OP's daughter is entitled to the money, not at all.

So am right. You do care more about the prestige of the event itself. Because a wedding is about the couple and isn't a family reunion. If you want a reunion you can always hold one .\nThe fact that you are not willing to even give the a portion to support their marriage just goes to show that you just wanted to show off to the event goers rather than offer support for the marriage.", "It's the same thing as if a parent saved money for there kids college, but the kid got grants or scholarships and wanted the parents to give them the money so they can go on vacation.", "But OP was willing to pay for a wedding(with family)--that was what the offer was for.  Tho I guess, OP could recompense them for cost of \"Elopement\"--ie license etc.", "If the couple was paying for it.\n\nThere are also many cultural and traditional perspectives to take into account here too. Some cultures view marriage as the joining of two families, not just two people", "It's weird to make that assumption when you've been told it's for a specific purpose though.\n\nOP says: \"we let her know we would contribute a set amount to her wedding when the time came.\"\n\nIt's not a reasonable expectation that she'd be able to use that money for purposes other than a wedding.", "This. It feels a bit like he thinks the family was entitled to a wedding she and her husband didn't want. Feels a bit too \"I paid, you'll  do it my way\". And close family and friends do give give gifts,  big wedding or not.", "Ok. It was more a family reunion.  That makes sense.", "If your parents didn\u2019t tell you they\u2019d give you cash for eloping would you expect a large sum of money?", "But in the US, you can get married at a courthouse, in your jeans if you want, and of course you need to pay for the license and notary fee. Often less than $100 and they are just as married. That's only about the couple. No one spends $15K on an actual wedding to have solely them, a notary, and 2 witnesses there - with flowers, catering, music, gown, photography, etc. That's what differentiates it from being 100 percent about the two people.", "By helping cover the wedding costs is helping support the marriage, but this cost was never occured so need to financially assist on this front. What kind of entitlement bs are you on about.", "Lol read OP's other comments. But either way, I totally get OP's point of view. If daughter wants to have a wedding, then OP will contribute to the wedding - as it is a huge expense, that isn't neccessary to living and that daughter and fiance may not have been able to afford by themself. OP is providing them a way to have this big celebration if they want to have it - without them having to factor in money. OP's gift was about giving them the realistic option of having a wedding. \n\nIf they don't have the wedding, then the offer is no longer valid, as the reason for the offer is no longer valid.\n\nTo put this into perspective, my parents would help me financially if I wanted to go travelling - so that money wouldn't be the limiting factor. But if I tell my parents I want to go on a trip, then change my mind and just go to the beach or something (5min drive) - why on earth would they still give me that money?", "I agree with this as well.", "Agreed.  \n\n\nA wedding is a family event. It is a major milestone that the people who have watched you grow up want to see. And it is a rare opportunity for people who don't often get the chance to see each other to come together in celebration.  \n\n\nI have some family members that I simply cannot stand, but if I ever get married I would still invite them to my wedding. Because I'm not enough of an asshole to exclude them from a family reunion just because I don't like them.", ">I'd agree with you if it weren't also for the expectation for parents to pay/contribute.\n\nnot just contribute, but **participate**.\n\n>It is an event for the couple and whomever the choose to celebrate them.\n\nThis the kind of attitude that leads to couples treating people **participating** in their celebration like slaves.", "I agree with you.  I am always baffled how some parents are willing to empty their pockets to fund their kids wedding, but wont give that same money to give to the child to use for a down payment or investment.", "Me too. It matters not what they spend it on. And if the don't marry, the cash for vacation,  down-payment for a house or what. I don't think anyone's wrong but dad and daughter may be looking at this very differently.  I wonder if the wedding was getting out of her control,  as a family event more than the couples.", "Just because OP very clearly explains his intentions on Reddit doesn\u2019t mean that he very clearly explained it to his daughter. We have no idea how the conversation went between the 2 of them or what her understanding was.", "Exactly, he doesn\u2019t want to give his daughter a generous gift  for *her* to *celebrate her marriage* because *he* didn\u2019t get the celebration he wanted.", "It would be pretty dang small in my experience. I had 100 people at my wedding which I consider small-medium and we barely got out for under 25k, which was about 7 more than I wanted to spend. My mom went a little overboard on adding things on, as I was the first to get married.\n\nMy sister had 40 people and it was just over 15k, and I even made all of the desserts and did the flowers, so all she had to pay for was supplies and ingredients. Weddings are Fing crazy. She\u2019s been married just over 2 years and they\u2019re likely getting divorced this year. She used the other 10k (my parents wanted it to be even with the funds distributed between us) as a part of a down payment on a house and for her honeymoon.", "What part of my first comment makes you feel the need to ask that? I said we had discussed it. I asked if they did. I also said she shouldn\u2019t assume.", "It\u2019s to celebrate their marriage with their family and friends. That doesn\u2019t make it about the family. A birthday party isn\u2019t about the guests - it\u2019s about the birthday boy or girl. They can have a birthday without everyone, but they want to celebrate with their loved ones. That doesn\u2019t make it any less about the birthday person just like having guests at a wedding doesn\u2019t make it any less about the bride and groom.\n\nSome may be more focused on the party, but from the way OP described their daughter, that ever would have been the case with her. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted a big party. Her parents are essentially penalizing her bc she isn\u2019t celebrating her marriage in a way they want. \u201cYou can have our $15k if and only if you have a party that we can treat as a family reunion\u201d.", "Yes. I know several couples that didn't have much money and were going to just do small/courthouse weddings, but then the parents decided to fund it so it could be a big family event.", "no, we paid 100% but it was a \"family\" invent because all celebrated together.  We also paid for our own honeymoon", "Me too! I am floored to see people say it is not a family event. Each his own I guess, it just seems weird to me too.", "<<So, e.g., two orphans cannot get married?>> That is a facile response.  \nOF course legally two orphans can get married--but they can't have their parents pay for it.  Nor can they have parents pay for the Honeymoon.\n\nWhich is the issue here.", "I was being sarcastic. I'll clarify.", "Courthouse fees, exactly. In my town that's $10.", "ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!?!?!? Hold your horses, Rockefeller!", "We have no good reason to believe the OP is lying here.", "Yes. Very surprised at many other answers.", "Precisely. If OP daughter wanted a small wedding, $15k+/- would work for an intimate family only wedding. But they obviously wanted to bag the cash.", "You paid 100% so you can do whatever you want and call it whatever you want.", "I'm not reading it literally, I'm reading it logically.  You are the one trying to get oddly pedantic, saying that one person is a family.\n\nFor hundreds of millions of people, they view a wedding as being a joining of two people, where the biological families are not viewed as being catetogically pivotal to the gathering, but rather are viewed as one of many important elements on the day.\n\nAre you telling these people that they are wrong and that they did not get married because they believe this? You alone can define when a person gets married? Their marriage was invalid unless they want everyone that they know to suddenly merge and become one with the important people of their partner? It is universally invalid to still have discrete worlds after a wedding?", "Never said he\u2019s lying, but there\u2019s zero context given.", "Yeah, it\u2019s totally different if they had the understanding that the cash was a gift for getting married, whether it be used on a wedding or otherwise, but that wasn\u2019t the agreement or the discussion had. Not a great assumption on the daughters part. I think she probably had friends who were given a similar offer to my sister, and unfairly thought she would be offered the same.\n\nOP isn\u2019t the AH for sure, and the daughter should have spoken about it with them ahead of time so she could have made an informed decision.", "It seems to me that the daughter planned it this way and since they already got married daddy can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d that\u2019s why she\u2019s in shock that turns out daddy can in fact say no. I feel like the daughter knew her dad would say no if she were to open up the idea of eloping that\u2019s why she just went ahead and did it. And OP is right, it\u2019s weird for grown ups to expect other grown ups to pay for a one month long vacation/honeymoon. 15k was to help daughter to have more freedom with their expenses so that their money isn\u2019t totally drained on the wedding. It was a kind gesture and them being supportive as parents but daughter took advantage of that. Normally, if a person isn\u2019t invited to an event, they are not and should not be expected to bring a gift of some sort.", "We are no longer in times where weddings were a business contract that had the intent to increase or consolidate wealth and power. It is a joining of love. The love of two people. They do not get married to join their families together, at least not in most cultures today. The families have no obligations towards each other. It is therefore no longer the joining of two families.", "NTA. You said you\u2019d help with the wedding, not the honeymoon. Big difference.", "Mild YTA, only because it sounds like you told your daughter this money was there already, but you didn\u2019t like what she planned to do with it.\n\nNo one is entitled to money. But it does sound like you had already mentioned this money to your daughter, otherwise how would she have known about it?\n\nIf you had expectations/restrictions on what you would pay for, then you should have been Frank with her, not leave her to read your mind.\n\nI get why you want a family event, but I\u2019d also urge you to consider that some people are very uncomfortable at those events.  If your daughter is one of them, it seems crappy to make your present dependent on that.\n\nI also hope you don\u2019t have any other kids, because if you do, you are going to end up in a bad place if you treat them differently for weddings.", "Imma stray from the crowd and say neither of you were the asshole??? Idk, I still feel like you should contribute toward the honey moon, but not the whole amount you were gonna give. They didn\u2019t want a big wedding, but still wanna celebrate their love in a different way. You did say it was for the WEDDING not the honey moon. She sees it as them still celebrating their love and just didn\u2019t realise that when you said you\u2019d help pay, it was so everyone could celebrate together, and not just them. Idk though, I\u2019ve never been married or had the luxury of having a parent that could even offer to pay. And maybe the money could go towards them starting their lives together instead of a big expensive wedding. Seems a waste of money to me, but I just prefer the simply things personally.", "NTA. BUT, a wedding is about the couple and what they want, not what family or anyone else wants, so I disagree strongly with that. That mindset is why I went to Vegas and got married, my way.", "Ppl saying NTA but I think that you\u2019re offering money for her wedding celebration only if it happens under your terms. The way they wanted to celebrate was a private elopement and honeymoon. You were going to contribute the money, so what financial difference does it make to at least contribute some of it for a nice honeymoon? I feel like so many family relationships on this subreddit are cold and conditional. \n\nYTA", "ESh.  My father offered me the money he would have put towards a wedding as a gift to put a downpayment on a house or a new car.  It sounds like the money is available, but parents didn't want to skip the party.  Daughter shouldn't have assumed, but it sounds like communicatoin wasn't clear.", "YTA. You say fine but obviously not fine. Clearly you view her feelings to not have a big ceremony as selfish and are penalizing her for it. You could have contributed a modest gift that maybe wasn't as much as a full wedding but still enough to show you respected their decision to not have a huge affair.", "Light YTA but this isn't my hill to die on. I get all your points even if I disagree, although a wedding definitely is about the 2 people getting married. Wondering if familial relationships contributed to the decision to elope and further wondering if the daughter felt like she cant share that with you. You didn't technically do anything wrong, but don't be surprised if your relationship is negatively impacted in the long term. Have you considered offering a compromise of maybe half of what you were originally willing to pay?", "NTA. You said you would contribute to a wedding, not give her money, and it is your money.", "NTA. It's fair for both sides to be a little disappointed but ultimately they have to respect each others' choices in this scenario. Also, paying for different services is different than being able to  provide \"cash\" - obviously we don't know OP's financial situation so we can't know if this would even be possible.", "\" ...a wedding is about the couple...\". \n\nThat made me laugh. \n\nIn this sub it's soooo about the couple, but mostly the bride, her \"perfect day\", her tantrums, her lording it over, and her entitlement.", "Comments like these always puzzle me.

That said, internet points aren't a currency you can exchange for your daughter's goodwill.
