The couple chose not to host the event, so there\u2019s no monetary burden.", "I think superb-solutions is being sarcastic in saying \u2018why even involve her\u2019?\n\nOP is doubling down on its money for a *family* event, and if it\u2019s a *family event* they\u2019re so desperate for they can throw their own instead of hijacking her wedding to do so.\n\nI might be wrong though.", "This is false equivalence. Obviously there are things that are not acceptable but creating expectations around how, where, when, etc your offspring will marry is absolutely not the parents' right whatsoever. .", "It sure sounds like it", "No one, they're farming negative karma.", "Could be. Then he should just say that. His daughter might have thought its a gift. Because he loves her. Some kids never marry. No money then? Only if you get married and only if you have a big wedding the way the parents want? Fine but he should be clear.", "So is responding to a public question on a public form :)", "Sure, but then the kid doesn't have a right to the money if they choose to forfeit it, right? \n\nThe money was earmarked for a cultural expectation and the parents made that clear. The eloped chose not to partake in that expectation and therefore forfeit access to it. \n\nTradeoffs.", "The parents did not say. \"We have $15k earmarked for a wedding. You'd darn well better have a big family wedding!\" OP did not sound bitter that the daughter opted to elope. The only problem was that she heard that there was $15k designated for her wedding and **expected** to control how that money was spent when there was no wedding.\n\nWhen you offer to help someone, you can earmark a purpose for those funds. That's not selfish.", ">I do hope tho he doesn\u2019t feel entitle to her time anymore. I hope he understands when she goes to spend the holidays or birthdays with her in laws or stop texting him. When she gets pregnant and he can\u2019t be a part of it.\n\nIt's really, really sad to me that you think the daughter would be justified in excluding her parents from her life because they would not give her a large sum of cash. It's an odd sense if entitlement to assume money set aside for a wedding would just be given as cash for a honeymoon instead without any discussion or compromise. I wonder if the decision to completely forego the wedding was made specifically to fund the honeymoon. That would be a huge AH move and real manipulation on the daughter's part.", "Nope.  She can gladly stop talking to him her her entitled attitude!", "You are weird", "I guess u/iheartwords only hearts words when they agree with her lol", "Nobody's got any right to anyone else's money. The parents own the money. They can withdraw the offer any time they like.. I am objecting to overbearing, interfering parents trying to steer the course of their daughter's life and trying to hold her over a barrel about it. I would tell them to stuff the fucken money up their collective arses.", "Unfortunately I think he did it out of spite for her not having the wedding he wanted her too.. was she entitle to the money no but the way he went about it was awful too. Maybe a compromise would be nice. The thing is I\u2019m sure this will damage their relationship. I hope that I am wrong but I feel that this will be a big damage to their relationship and will set the tone for their future as a family.", "Hopefully! That way op never has to see their child ever again. Just what every parent wants", "Sunset heart hands?", "I\u2019m literally agreeing with OP.", "No. I just don\u2019t know why there was such rudeness when I said something similar and meant it in a supportive way.", "I don't see where they were overbearing. Or where they \"held her over a barrel.\" They offered money for a purpose and then withdrew it when that purpose was reneged upon. \n\nWhere were they overbearing in the story?", "Nothing in this post sounded spiteful to me. Disappointed? Sure, but not spiteful. And the daughter never bothered to ask, she just assumed she would get the wedding money to use however she wanted. The sheer entitlement of it negates any perceived spite, in my opinion.", "Absolutely because that\u2019s what I got from reading his post too.  Not a delusional idea at all.", "They expected her to conform to their ideas and offered money as a coercion to get her to behave as they thought she should. Perhaps you are tied to your parents' apron strings if you think this is not overbearing and selfish behaviour on their part.", "What? They offered to fund a party, there was no party, therefore the offer was declined.", "I'm a parent of two kids. I have a 529 I contribute to monthly. If they choose to attend college or at least a post-high school program of some sort they will get pretty much free post-secondary education out of us. Yes, I'm pushing and \"coercing\" them to do something.\n\nParenting is, frankly, partly coercion. Pushing my kids into Hebrew school and Chinese language courses (edit: and piano LOL, yes) isn't their \"choice.\" They do it because it's part of their cultural upbringing. And I'm hardly \"tied to my parent's apron strings\" as much as I see my family and my wife's family as a part of my own and we try to honor and support our shared family communities.\n\nBut say  both kids choose not to go to college and instead become full-time \"influencers,\" (ugh, tsuris) I'm not giving them the 529s just because it's there. I'm probably going to instead donate it to other kids instead as a small scholarship fund. The money is there to help them make easy choices to go to college, but it's not a \"just because\" fund.\n\nJust like I'm not giving my girls parties at 13 \"just because\" if they choose not to go through with getting bat mitzvahed. They can choose that, and that's fine, but the bat mitzvah money comes with the bat mitzvah. It's not \"just because.\"", "They did NOT offer the money as \"coercion,\" that's ridiculous. They offered the money in case the daughter \\*wanted\\* a pricier wedding so she wouldn't have to pay for it. She didn't want that. If you invite someone to your house for dinner, can they decline and get the cash instead?"]}
