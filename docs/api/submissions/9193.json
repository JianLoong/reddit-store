He needs to communicate instead of getting riled up when he\u2019s worried you\u2019re avoiding him.", "NTA but i kind of understand his side. i have a friend who tends to just leave, without notice, if we go out for coffee he'll just wander off, don't know if he's just going to the bathroom, if he left or what. Not a huge deal but it can get frustrating cause now you're kinda stuck waiting to see what's up.", "NTA, you know what I do when my wife goes upstairs when we\u2019re on the couch together? Ask if she\u2019s going upstairs for the night, and if I really want to hang out with her, I express that.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband sounds toxic af though. Why on earth are you required to sit in a room where they watch a show you're not interested in instead of doing what you like? And while never saying goodbye would be weird, or intentionally not saying goodbye wouldbe weird too... how is it you're not allowed to \"space out\" and accidentally fall asleep while you didn't plan to do so?\n\n> His response was \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit anymore\u201d \n\nIs he trying to emotional manipulate you into believing you actually did something wrong? Trying to get you to be scared so you'll be more compliant? \n\nOr is there something else going on?", "I think you two have bigger issues at hand then who was TA in this situation.", "NTA, but the hub is.  He's got a total lack of empathy, he's selfish, and immediately goes nuclear over the smallest perceived slight (instead of pondering his own angry reaction to see if it makes sense).", "NTA - it\u2019s not like you left the house, you were just in a different room \ud83d\ude00", "NTA.  Does he expect you to sit there and twiddle your thumbs while he watches something you don\u2019t want to watch.  And how old is your son?  If he\u2019s under 16, he shouldn\u2019t be watching Breaking Bad.  One more thing, I don\u2019t care how bad his day was.  He has no right to speak to you like that.  I have to agree that there is more going on here than just poor communication.", "This is great! I need to incorporate this into my routine!", "This made me giggle. This makes sense too", "He's gaslighting and parentifying her, divorce is clearly the only option", "Maybe try doing it in a healthy way instead of being unnecessarily dramatic", "I'm honestly so curious as to where this phrase came from because it takes like seven years to get any Irish person to leave your home, or to leave an Irish home lol. Ending phone calls also takes ages lol.", "And what is with men who want their significant others in the room when they are not doing something that benefits both?  Band practices... working on cars... playing video games... watching a TV show one doesn't like.\n\nIt's so weird."]}
