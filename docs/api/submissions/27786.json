My grandson is now 17 and my granddaughter is almost 16. Their relationship with my son has been on a downward spiral for years. It started when he and his current wife moved in together. She had two kids of her own and early on they showed extreme jealousy whenever their mom would pay any attention or buy anything for my grandkids. They were older (teenagers) and said a number of cruel things to my grandkids. My grandkids told my son, they told my wife and I and we spoke to our son, but he ignored all four of us. My wife also spoke to my son's second wife (prior to the wedding) and she said her kids would adjust in time.\n\nMy grandkids spent years living with two much older kids who told them they deserved to have a dead mom and that she had wanted to die because nobody would want them around. They accused them of stealing from them because their mom shouldn't be doing anything for them. There were incidents where they broke the stuff their mom bought my grandkids. My wife and I pleaded with our son to do something to help his kids. We said they didn't deserve to be raised like that.\n\nThe problems continued even after the older kids moved out. They still expressed a lot of jealousy and hatred for my grandkids.\n\nI never interacted much with my son's stepkids. I saw them a handful of times in the years my son has been married to his current wife. They would mostly go to their dad if my son and his wife were spending time with us or any of our other kids. Or they would reject offers to spend time with us. But the few times I did see them I was always shocked by how blatant their hate of my grandkids was and how my son never appeared to care. One incident in particular stands out. It was my granddaughter's birthday and she got some art kit she had wanted. It set off the two older kids who called her a bitch baby and they even broke part of the kit. My wife and I spoke up to our son and his wife but they did nothing and said nothing.\n\nMy grandkids now spend a lot of time with myself and my wife. They hardly speak to their dad despite living under his roof. They wanted us to get custody of them but we were denied. So they have taken to doing their best to make it through the next year/two years.\n\nMy son is only now starting to care that the relationship with his kids has been destroyed. He asked me why we tried to fight for custody of the kids when he's their dad and he accused my wife and I of turning the kids against him. This is when I stopped him and I said we didn't turn them against him. He is just living with the consequences of ignoring what his kids were telling him. I told him he put them through years of bullying so he could marry and stay married and now he has to live with his decision. My son ranted at me and said the last thing any parent should do is try to make their kid feel shitty about themself which is what I was doing.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695889806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uad5g/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_needs_to_live_with_the/", "score": 2728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you haven't, might I suggest you do that as soon as possible and in front of your grandchildren? I'd bet they would love to see that.", "NTA.

In addition to his kids and you telling him about things that happened, he's also witnessed things, like the example you're giving with the birthdays.\n\nYou're not turning his kids against him; you're giving his kids a place to escape their home situation, and the only reason that's a necessity is because their dad didn't defend them against that. That's on him.", "NTA- but your son surely is.\n\nI don't think your grandkids and your son's relationship would get any better considering the way your son is acting, which is very sad. Losing a mom is already hard and their father not doing what he is supposed to do to protect his kids is just horrible.

You filed for custody because you realized that your grandchildren deserved a far better life than what they were getting under their dad's roof.\n\nIs having a bang maid in your life worth destroying your children's childhood?\n\nI absolutely would have been that brutal.", "NTA, but I would go as far as to say that the behaviour of your son and his wife are abusive to your grandchildren, they have been complicit at best and in some cases supportive in over a decade of bullying of their children to whom they at least own a duty of care towards which they have entirely abrogated. The parents and step siblings should be ashamed of themselves. I wouldn\u2019t normally advocate for this but hell bust those kids out, and never speak to the shower of awfulness again. What an awful bunch of people. Get those grandkids out and get away, if there is no way for them to get out teach them how to commit some awful humiliating pranks of their step siblings and parents sounds like they massively deserve it.", "NTA.  You tried to help your grandchildren, your son chose not to listen.  He is now living with the consequences.  Once your grandchildren turn 18 they will never speak to him again.

Hope your son is aware those kids will go NC once they\u2019re out. They\u2019ve pretty much given up on him and he deserves it. And my god this step-kids are AWFUL.

He refuses to attend the discussion in which case you know how little he actually cares about trying to build a relationship that he won't even sit down and talk it through.\n\nHonstely the fact he came to you asking for advice on how to fix the relationship and not trying to talk to them directly kinda hints to me that he knows he fucked up and was expecting you to comfort him and say he did nothing wrong rather than tell him the truth, hence the quoted rant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
