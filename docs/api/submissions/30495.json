Jane has been dating Lacey(18) for around 3 and a half years I think. Lacey is Trans, MTF but hasn't started hormone therapy or had corrective surgeries yet, my friend Actively told me about their sex life and has came to me for comfort ect during the relationship.(age of concent in my country is 16)i fully have told her that I don't think I've heard someone talk about another person with such love so it's not like I'm saying this to ruin their relationship. However recently Jane and I was on a FaceTime and she was telling me that she felt sick all the time, that she was emotional, that she was tired all the time and that no matter how little she was eating she was still gaining weight. To me this sounds like pregnancy- so I told her is it possible she could be pregnant. She started freaking out at me on the call which is understandable- then she started started asking why would I say that and that they have been careful by using protection. I tried to tell her Condoms are only 99% affective but she hung up. I texted her asking if she was ok with no reply, The next day I tried to text and call her and she asked me to not message or call her as she was upset with me over what I had said. I told her I haven't done fuck all and if she was serious. she told me that she was setting a boundary and I'm going off on her- which wasn't the case at all. I asked her why she was upset with me and ignoring me even though I don't think I did anything wrong to which she said to leave her alone. I texted her saying that I want an apology when she is ready and I'll see her later. This was on the 26th/27th of October and we haven't spoken since\n\nI've been thinking a lot about it and have been wondering if I actually did something wrong to upset her. But at the same time it's not the first time she has shouted at me  and said nasty things ect when she was stressed.\nSo am I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1699342594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pp3dl/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_might_be_pregnant/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA \n\nThat said, she\u2019s probably having a hard time mentally dealing with the idea of a teenage pregnancy. So the anger and frustration, confusion and fear are being put on you. You likely gave voice to what her inner monologue was already telling her. You burst her bubble of denial. Classic case of shooting the messenger. \n\nYou obviously care for your friend, take a step back and give her time to come around.", "NTA\n\nShe has probably been thinking the same thing and is panicking about it.  You are just the one who has brought it up and now she is using you as someone to blame as a way of deflecting her worries.\n\nIf she doesn't already it won't be long until she knows for sure.", "NTA. You suggested it as a potentially medical reality of her situation and a simple test would clear it up if she'd be willing to pull her head out of her ass. If you said it as a jab at her weight or figure, that would be uncalled for. But this was a \"those sympoms sound like X\" conversation. \n\nAt her age, managing her emotions isn't exactly a commonly mastered skill, so while I'm not going to excuse her volatile attitude towards you, I do understand where it's coming from. Best thing you can do is take a step back and let her come back to you on her terms. You can make it known that you want to be there to support her how you can as a friend, but you don't need to press her for it. She'll need to cope with things herself and come back to you willingly. It's possible it might not happen and it might actually be the end of a friendship, but you've done what you can. That's all you can really be asked to do. Good luck, kiddos.", "NTA\n\nShe is living in delusion.  You know, the kind where if you don't talk about it, it can't be true.\n\nAdvice:  Just back off and forget about her.  Don't go down the rabbit hole with her.", "NTA at all. She\u2019s probably just stressed at the idea of teenage pregnancy and is directing all this at you. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to, but if I was her friend - I would call her and say \u2018I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s she\u2019s stressed but I was only trying to help because the symptoms match up, whatever happens or doesn\u2019t happen, I will be there to support her. But please don\u2019t take it out on me that I suggested something very possible, and it\u2019s not ok for you to shout angry things at me\u2019. If she apologises I\u2019d stay friends, if she doesn\u2019t and is nasty: I\u2019d set the boundary I won\u2019t tolerate that and I\u2019m leaving the call for that response. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to treat you badly for being a friend", "NTA and sounds like she\u2019s in denial about the possibility because inside she knows it is in fact possible", "NTA, what you said was completely reasonable. She's  obviously processing what you said and is reacting to it in her own way. She is young and will learn that you were just being a friend.\n\nAll of that aside, what the hell is it with this sub and people demanding apologies from other people? I have never seen this behaviour outside of stories in this sub. Who would even want a coerced apology?", "NTA, she's in denial. You're right, with the symptoms she describes it's reasonable to believe that she might be pregnant. I wouldn't even really accept an apology at this point. You are as entitled as her to set up boundaries, even though the ones she puts up seem to be unhealthy.", "NTA at all. You did nothing wrong. Condoms are only that effective if used properly & a lot of people don\u2019t use them properly or will only use them when they\u2019re about to cum/won\u2019t use them at all cause they\u2019re going to pull out before coming without realising how terrible that method is. \n\nShe could be taking it out on you cause she\u2019s scared you\u2019re right but either way she does owe you an apology. Unless you said anything you didn\u2019t rely here then you weren\u2019t transphobic or anything so that\u2019s not an issue.", "NTA You know when people say don't shoot the messenger? That's what she's doing", "NTA but it sounds like you're friendship is over", "NTA Pregnancy is definitely a possibility. Although there are other potential reasons for those symptoms too. A pregnancy test would be the first point of call.\n\nI can appreciate why she's freaking out though, acting on emotional impulse and lashing out at you. Shoot the messenger is an expression for a reason... Not justified but very common.\n\nYou're not obligated to do anything, but if it was my friend, I would make contact again and, if possible, go with her to get a pregnancy test to check. It sounds like she needs a friend. She's probably feeling incredibly isolated and like she's got no one to turn to. It may not be an easy ride for you, but we support the people we care about as much as we can.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You did not blame, you did not shame, you didn't even insist, you merely suggested the possibility. And this girl acts like you've accused her and her whole family of the worst crimes known to man? lol no.  \nJane sounds insufferable, exhausting, and not a friend worth having.  \nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou said what everyone would. Nothing wrong with it either. She may be frighteners of it, plus if she really is pregnant, hormones, so... However it does not apologize for her treatment to you. You deserve an appropriate apologize if she realize she want to keep your friendship. To the... How long? Two weeks? Of no communication... Me and my bff once got into a fight (over messenger the app) cause we have different views about xxx and we didn't speak (or write) for 8 months I believe. I missed her much so once I decided to suggest we meet and she went for it immediately. We're now friends again. Relationship need time (when they bloom and in crisis as well, depends how big the crisis), in your case I belive it wont take so long. Me and my friend we were kinda both in right, but here you are the one in right, so she should be the one to reach out to you. And I believe she will after she takes the pregnant test.", "And if it's not pregnancy, it's most likely something serious that she needs to see a doctor for, since conditions that have similar symptoms don't simply go away of themselves and some can even be fatal. \n\nNTA", "No,absolutely not. She has symptoms of pregnancy and I told her what I thought", "NTA you are a great listener. She is processing her behavior and is upset that she may have made a choice that has backfired on her and now her future plans are in jeopardy. I'll infer that abortion is probably not an option wherever she is at.", "NTA\n\nYou were reasonable, and she was not. \n\nHowever, demanding an apology is silly and counterproductive. Any such apology would not be heartfelt, and the demand itself can prolong the conflict.", "NTA\n\nThere was a person (non-binary maybe age 17?) at my OB/GYN that was enraged that they were pregnant. They said it was impossible because they don't identify as female and can't be because of that. Their parent was getting very upset. My only update is they did go forward with the pregnancy because I saw them at later appointments, but idk if they kept the baby.\n\nYou're not a bad friend, it's biologically possible regardless of how much she doesn't want it to happen. I would reach out with an apology and add that you are a safe person to talk to about if she is.", "NTA, as others have suggested, she sounds high maintenance/drama.  Do your future self a favor and back away.", "It was ok for you to bring up pregnancy. But demanding an apology while she's still upset and asking for space isn't great.", "Nahh she's wrong...you were just looking out for her and she's being to overly sensitive and dramatic \nShe should just test for the pregnancy to make sure \n\nNTA I dont think you did or said anything offensive", "NTA \n\nAll you said was that it's possible she could be pregnant. She is probably just scared. If she has shouted at you before when stressed, then I would give her a little bit of time. \n\nI hope things get better and you hear from her soon.", "If she is mad at you, it is just misdirected anger. NTA.", "NTA but for goodness sake get her to take a test. It\u2019s not transphobic to suggest pregnancy can happen when two people have compatible gametes and are doing sexual things together", "NTA It's not your fault she wanted to pretend like the obvious answer isn't it.", "She sounds super preggo", "NTA. She\u2019s lashing out because you voiced her deepest fear, that at this point she has definitely considered, as being a possibility. Might be best to just leave it and hopefully she\u2019ll come to terms with the situation and apologise to you.", "NTA she is taking her stress out on you", "NTA. Move on. She probably knows she's pregnant and doesn't even want to admit it to herself", "NAH. You did/said nothing wrong. But an unexpected pregnancy can terrify a full grown adult, nevermind a teenager. She snapped at you because she was scared and panicking which is understandable. We all deserve a little leeway in those moments so don't wait on the apology. I'd send her a message to say you're there if she needs to talk and leave it at that. If she is pregnant she's going to need plenty of support whatever she decides. And even if she's not, teenage pregnancy scares can be a bit of a headfuck and I'm sure could do with a friend to help sort through those emotions.", "It is an option here and is Covered by NHS.", "That is good for women there. I often consider that women may not hold a viewpoint that does not allow them to use those resources, even if they need it. C'est la vie."]}
