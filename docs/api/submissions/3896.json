You got blackout drunk at a family holiday and somehow never noticed that you were even a little too drunk before that point? That\u2019s a big deal and there could be much more dangerous places where that could happen and you could endanger yourself or others.

Topping off someone's drinks is not cool because it takes away their ability to judge how much they are drinking. It's especially not cool to do to someone who is young and new to drinking, because they won't be familiar with this move and won't have much ability to gauge their own level of intoxication. If you make a cocktail that's strong but doesn't taste strong, you need to warn your guests about it. Mixing up a strong cocktail that doesn't taste strong, then topping off a 21-year-old's glass with it repeatedly even as they're becoming visibly drunk, is classic frat-boy predator behavior.

You both were bad.", "ESH, but with more AH leaning towards your family\n\nWhen you don't have experience in something, you need to pace yourself and take it easy. If your family is serving cocktails at dinner, that tells me you've been around drinking at points in your life, even if you didn't partake. Unless everyone is slamming drinks and getting wasted every time, which it doesn't sound like, you would have seen how they pace themselves. \n\nBut again, you are new to it, and don't taste alcohol strongly especially in cocktails. (Keep this in mind every time you drink. Your perception will get altered the more you drink and you could easily accidentally give yourself alcohol poisoning)\n\nThe majority of the blame is on your dad. Being experienced, and in that sense, being the bartender, and DD, he absolutely should have been being an eye on you, pacing you, cutting you off, and not slipping you more alcohol. That is messed up, and if it was meant as a \"joke\", that is also needed up. \n\nYour other family members are also in the wrong. They all saw you getting drunker and drunker and didn't cut you off, or tell your dad to stop? Your brother saw your dad topping you off all night and didn't say or do anything about it? If your family drinks, they all should have been watching out for the new drinker, or designated someone to be your handler/DD for the night. Instead, they all watched you black out, knowing it was some of your first drinks and your birthday recently, and then got mad at you about it? That's messed up. At least college bros people getting their friends plastered on their 21st have the decency to not get pissed when their friends gets sick from it.", "NTA\n\nWas gonna be E S H but your dad topped you up without your knowing so he's completely the asshole!\n\nTake this as a lesson: ALWAYS ask what's in a drink! Ultimately you're responsible for what you put in your own body so unless you make it yourself or watch it being made you gotta ask. On average cocktails have 1.5 oz of liquor but different types vary in strength, and of course there are cocktails that are almost entirely alcohol but you'd be able to taste it.\n\nSecond lesson: don't drink more than one drink an hour. This will let your body process it even if it's strong so you're not trying to play catch-up when the second drink comes.\n\nA newbie drinker can get pretty smashed on 3 regular drinks, it totally depends on your size and metabolism so they may not have been particularly strong but of course none of that matters if your drink is basically bottomless and you really had more than 3.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed in your parents, your dad set you up to fail even if that's not what he intended.", "NTA.

People are allowed to discuss any issues they have even if they are less serious than what you personally are experiencing.", "Found the real \"A\" around here.", "He has not said a word to me since thanksgiving so unsure how he feels currently.", "I don\u2019t remember him topping off my drinks, I\u2019m going by what my brother said there. I had the like 2.5 - 3 and was sipping those, felt slightly buzzed and then it\u2019s lights out. If I\u2019m understanding correctly, my dad topping up my drink occurred after I blacked out and was visibly intoxicated.", "Yeah it just sucks cause I somehow missed the \u2018realizing I\u2019m getting wasted\u2019 phase. I was just sipping my drink, feeling a bit buzzed and then the lights go out. I just plan on not drinking at any family events for quite some time, if I\u2019m invited.", "My cardinal rule for drinking at social events is i never let anyone get me drinks. Getting your own drinks means a) you know how much you are having b) you have to get up so you have to walk and if you are too drunk to walk you are too drunk for more and c) you know what\u2019s in your drink. NTA no matter how your mom is acting this happens to everyone once at least. Your dad shouldn\u2019t have fed you strong drinks at a family event.", "In all sincerity, this can end up being a great life lesson for you. If you can make this the worst thing you ever do drunk, you could save yourself a lot of trouble down the road.", "Damn girl! That definitely was not right of him! He should have been taking care of you and cut you off as soon as you started looking tipsy.", "I have to wonder though if you *said* something during your blackout to upset your family this much. This can't just be about a rug. You probably puked on several rugs in the process of growing up and they didn't act this upset. You really do have to have an actual conversation with them about this at some point.", "Right. So after half a drink or one or however much she feels is appropriate, she should stop drinking so it doesn\u2019t get out of control.", "I'm curious as to what was in the drink that it was so delicious. I don't like the taste of most booze but I remember getting really drunk on Singapore slings in college because they really do taste great. I eventually quit drinking anything I liked the taste of. \n\nAnyway, this is on your dad, who should have known better. Unless he was trying to get you drunk, which is worse.", "You could of just, not drunk it? You\u2019re blaming him for your actions. No is a full sentence", "I wish I could upvote twice.", "I'm guessing he knows he's partially (mostly) at fault but doesn't want to end up on your mom's crap list, so he's letting you twist in the wind and take the blame. I'm trying not to neg on your dad but he really isn't covering himself in glory by hanging you out to dry this way.", "This is a great personal rule, it just sucks that OP can\u2019t even trust her own father to be transparent about what she was being served.", "Absolutely. Just saying that some people really do have that low of a tolerance. And in this case, OP wasn't aware of how low theirs was. Dumb choices that most newly able to drink people make.", "I\u2019m still not sure what the drinks were, but it just tasted like fruity ginger ale. Usually if I drink anything with liquor I can taste it or feel the burn but it just tasted like soda so I just figured it was a weak drink.", "Well on the bright side, now you know fruity doesn't equal weak... the Singapore sling has gin and cherry brandy. Good to find out when it's just your dad over serving."]}
