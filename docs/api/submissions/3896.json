You got blackout drunk at a family holiday and somehow never noticed that you were even a little too drunk before that point?

Topping off someone's drinks is not cool because it takes away their ability to judge how much they are drinking. It's especially not cool to do to someone who is young and new to drinking, because they won't be familiar with this move and won't have much ability to gauge their own level of intoxication. If you make a cocktail that's strong but doesn't taste strong, you need to warn your guests about it. Mixing up a strong cocktail that doesn't taste strong, then topping off a 21-year-old's glass with it repeatedly even as they're becoming visibly drunk, is classic frat-boy predator behavior.

You both were bad.", "ESH, but with more AH leaning towards your family\n\nWhen you don't have experience in something, you need to pace yourself and take it easy. If your family is serving cocktails at dinner, that tells me you've been around drinking at points in your life, even if you didn't partake. Unless everyone is slamming drinks and getting wasted every time, which it doesn't sound like, you would have seen how they pace themselves. \n\nBut again, you are new to it, and don't taste alcohol strongly especially in cocktails. (Keep this in mind every time you drink. Your perception will get altered the more you drink and you could easily accidentally give yourself alcohol poisoning)\n\nThe majority of the blame is on your dad. Being experienced, and in that sense, being the bartender, and DD, he absolutely should have been being an eye on you, pacing you, cutting you off, and not slipping you more alcohol. That is messed up, and if it was meant as a \"joke\", that is also needed up. \n\nYour other family members are also in the wrong. They all saw you getting drunker and drunker and didn't cut you off, or tell your dad to stop? Your brother saw your dad topping you off all night and didn't say or do anything about it? If your family drinks, they all should have been watching out for the new drinker, or designated someone to be your handler/DD for the night. Instead, they all watched you black out, knowing it was some of your first drinks and your birthday recently, and then got mad at you about it? That's messed up. At least college bros people getting their friends plastered on their 21st have the decency to not get pissed when their friends gets sick from it.", "NTA\n\nWas gonna be E S H but your dad topped you up without your knowing so he's completely the asshole!\n\nTake this as a lesson: ALWAYS ask what's in a drink! Ultimately you're responsible for what you put in your own body so unless you make it yourself or watch it being made you gotta ask. On average cocktails have 1.5 oz of liquor but different types vary in strength, and of course there are cocktails that are almost entirely alcohol but you'd be able to taste it.\n\nSecond lesson: don't drink more than one drink an hour. This will let your body process it even if it's strong so you're not trying to play catch-up when the second drink comes.\n\nA newbie drinker can get pretty smashed on 3 regular drinks, it totally depends on your size and metabolism so they may not have been particularly strong but of course none of that matters if your drink is basically bottomless and you really had more than 3.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed in your parents, your dad set you up to fail even if that's not what he intended.", "NTA.

I just plan on not drinking at any family events for quite some time, if I\u2019m invited.", "My cardinal rule for drinking at social events is i never let anyone get me drinks. Getting your own drinks means a) you know how much you are having b) you have to get up so you have to walk and if you are too drunk to walk you are too drunk for more and c) you know what\u2019s in your drink. NTA no matter how your mom is acting this happens to everyone once at least. Your dad shouldn\u2019t have fed you strong drinks at a family event.", "In all sincerity, this can end up being a great life lesson for you.

He should have been taking care of you and cut you off as soon as you started looking tipsy.", "I have to wonder though if you *said* something during your blackout to upset your family this much. This can't just be about a rug. You probably puked on several rugs in the process of growing up and they didn't act this upset. You really do have to have an actual conversation with them about this at some point.", "Right. So after half a drink or one or however much she feels is appropriate, she should stop drinking so it doesn\u2019t get out of control.", "I'm curious as to what was in the drink that it was so delicious. I don't like the taste of most booze but I remember getting really drunk on Singapore slings in college because they really do taste great.

Just saying that some people really do have that low of a tolerance. And in this case, OP wasn't aware of how low theirs was. Dumb choices that most newly able to drink people make.", "I\u2019m still not sure what the drinks were, but it just tasted like fruity ginger ale. Usually if I drink anything with liquor I can taste it or feel the burn but it just tasted like soda so I just figured it was a weak drink.", "Well on the bright side, now you know fruity doesn't equal weak... the Singapore sling has gin and cherry brandy.

You now know to be aware of what & how much you\u2019re drinking, and to watch who has access to your drink. It\u2019s a good habit, and although I\u2019m sad you had to learn it through your dad pushing booze on you, at least it wasn\u2019t a bad date. \n\nAre you going to have a talk with your dad?", "NTA.

Ignoring whatever scene you made at Thanksgiving, if you had done this anywhere else you could have put yourself in a very dangerous position (as mucb as we all wish that wasnt the case, it unfortunately is), so please take it is a lesson learned, next time it may not be your dad feeding you more drinks, it may be someone with far worse intentions.", "Your dad is a legend", "YTA You\u2019re 21.

My thoughts is he thought you'd notice the alcohol, and thought it'd be just funny to get you really drunk as you haven't been super drunk before. But it's not funny and downright irresponsible. Some people are insistent on this rite of passage of getting super drunk, but it's not something for everyone and your dad should have respected that. For experienced drinkers it can seem like harmless fun, after all they've gotten massively drunk and lived to tell the tale.

Could your brother talk to him maybe?", "My experience having grown up in Ireland and seen every kind of drunkeness is right now in the immediate aftermath is not a good time to justify you or blame your dad.\n\nThis is the time to acknowledge and apologise to your mom. No matter how you ended up that drunk she was the one whose home was damaged, she probably had to deal with you angry, needing taken care of, she probably hosted most of the day and is getting the responses and shame. Just saying \u2018send me the bill\u2019 is so passive as to be rude. It\u2019s \u2018you should have told me\u2019 like those partners who shrug off the emotional load.\n\nFirst up, send her a card or gift with an apology tailored to her. Her daughter went off the rails, her husband fucked her over. She is in the middle. You regain trust by being active. Do not gift alcohol. You can apologise for the bits you can acknowledge. Apologies do not use the word but. I\u2019m sorry is its own sentence. Full stop. Then what you are sorry for (this should include not really how by bickering that dad did it has hurt her further) and what amends you will make.\n\nThen once your mum has received an apology and something she can trust and also pass onto the other people caught up in this (oh yes OP sent a beautiful card and passes on her apologies) you will have a much better arena in which to highlight that your dad owes you an apology. But right now you are focusing on the wrong done you and not considering other people and that is compounding this.\n\nBeing at what you expect to be a family or calm\nevent and someone gets angry puking drunk is horrible.

And because everyone there was older than you they have \u2018but it wasn\u2019t my fault\u2019 as an excuse to bullshit them about drinking at least once and are less likely to trust it to be true than younger people. They just (unfairly) see someone who is digging their heels in.\n\nPart of being adult enough to drink is facing up to what you get involved in when you drink. You do not need to drown in shame but you have to show contrition. I once got absolutely shitfaced not realising meds I was on did not mix with alcohol. It was a genuine error of a teenager (we can drink at 18) and fuck me the hangover was like the tenth circle of hell on a bad day. It wasn\u2019t my fault but it was my responsibility to make amends for the absolute mayhem I created.\n\nI had to go into my local taxi firm and apologise because I asked the driver a bunch of highly personal political questions in pre ceasefire Belfast. I took a tip and the dressing down because I wanted to use cabs again. I fell into a large flowerpot my dad had to pull me out of, I lost my keys and tried to find them under the flowerpot in the greenhouse I left them in and wrecked half the plants, I kissed a guy in the club and said \u2018god my wisdom tooth removal last week was more fun\u2019 and walked off. My friend had to take me home and sit for two hours as my parents were at a wedding. They then had to reassure her parents, make up a bed to stay and deal with me covered in soil puking.\n\nNo one thought to say not to mix the meds which I took the last dose of that morning with booze because I did know to ask and they didn\u2019t think I would be drinking within 7 days of surgery. You learn by your mistakes and you learn from how you handle your mistakes. I had to apologise to everyone involved and when I went to school that week everyone had heard. \n\nIrishers are brutal so I learned front it out and face up to it. And still apologise. I was a party girl but that experience taught me know your limits, know your manners and people look out for you. You build credit by taking your role.\n\nStart there and then tackle dad. Mom will be much warmer to you than how you are acting and dad will get his comeuppance for his shit behaviour. And if you are visiting at Christmas, I would drink sparingly, offer to serve or steer clear.

And on the topic of \u201cno is a full sentence\u201d the dad kept topping off her drink when she wasn\u2019t looking. Where is her change to say no to that?", "I think there's more to what happened the fact that so many people are upset with you. If your brother can find out more without getting too involved I think it's a good thing.  \n  \nAlso to be clear, \"thanksgiving being ruined\" is entirely on your dad for feeding you strong drinks all night, well past the point of intoxication into alcohol poisoning.   \n  \nIs it a control thing with your dad maybe?", "Idk maybe your brother doesn't want to make you feel worse, so he's not going into detail about what you said. \n\nIs he the type to try and soften the blow or downplay events so people don't feel bad?", "He\u2019s never done it before. If anything he is annoyingly honest. He was in and out as usual since he\u2019s a heavy smoker so he was going out to smoke frequently so I know he missed some things but from what he said I was really confused, got upset because people were all over me and that\u2019s what made me angry and start to freak out.", "Honestly your family sucks.\n\n1.  First time drinking (legally) and your dad not only gives you one of those drinks that are a lie(don't taste the alcohol but are high in it) but even after you are clearly drunk, keeps going.  That's how you get alcohol poisoning and frankly you're lucky it was just puke.\n2. Instead of being concerned for you they're angry that the non-drinker who was pushed to having a lot of drinks acted drunk they are mad about a fucking rug.  Sure your mom loves the rug but I assume she'd love her kid more.\n3.

The whole family could visually see that you were drunk\n\n- After you reached the point of blackout your father was topping off your cup, without your knowledge or CONSENT\n\n -  Even though the whole family could see you were WAAY past your limit THEY WATCHED YOUR FATHER CONTINUE TO FEED YOU ALCOHOL \n\n-You threw up on your mom's beloved \"expensive\" rug, which made her upset but not the fact that your father WAS ACTIVELY POSIONING YOU!! \n\n-THE WHOLE FAMILY ACTIVELY WATCHED YOUR FATHER POSION YOU WITH ALCOHOL BUT BLAME YOU. \n\nAlcohol is all fun & dandy but it's fucking dangerous especially for the babies who have no clue their limits. You literally had 48hr before your own father used this mild stone birthday to poison you... You are absolutely NTA & not to be blamed. Yes pay to clean the rug, like you already plan, but do not punish yourself for this. I've seen people seriously hurt by the crap your father pulled & honestly to your mother.. a funeral is MUCH more expensive than a fucking rug. I've also seen people completely cut others off for this dangerous predatory behavior... Something is seriously wrong with your family & if I were you I'd start analyzing all interactions with your family because this whole situation is nuts.", "NTA I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more comments about how your family is responding since thanksgiving. Putting all the blame on you, your mom acting cold and your dad ignoring you is all very immature. Maybe your dad is ignoring you because he feels guilty, but if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s not dealing with it in a healthy way.

You (aided by your dad) made a mistake and your family should be understanding of that.\n\nI once puked in my sock drawer by my bed at 18 on Christmas Eve.

I bet alcoholism runs in the family.  Blacking out is not good.  Keep a close eye on the drinking and recognize that it may be a medical issue.", "NTA. Shit happens.

I\u2019m actually angry with your Dad. What he did was reckless and reprehensible. A lot of people have stories about puking after drinking. That\u2019s not uncommon when people overdo it.  But what people forget is that\u2019s because the level of alcohol that was imbibed upon has moved into the range of poisoning you. So your body reacts by attempting to remove the poison and you puke. Just like why you fall to the ground when your blood pressure isn\u2019t high enough to get the brain enough blood. When your down, the blood can get there. It\u2019s a self-preservation thing the body does, and you don\u2019t have control over at that point. \n\nSo your Dad continued to give you the alcohol even after you were visibly intoxicated and your Mom wants to blame you for the outcome? She\u2019s wrong. Your Dad was wrong to do this. And what\u2019s worse is this is a person you are supposed to trust and would not readily believe would do you harm. But to get blackout drunk like this seems unusual to me as a person who doesn\u2019t drink. That does not sound right but may speak to degree you were poisoned with it.  I would plan on either not ever drinking with them again, or not drinking at all given how you have a lack of memory of the events and how you reportedly behaved while drunk. Some people just should not drink. \n\nBeyond that don\u2019t let your anxiety make you spiral. I would reiterate to both parents that you would not have been in that situation if you had not been put into it and poisoned by the alcohol your father kept plying you with even after knowing you are a lightweight and were already visibly drunk. That you would have expected that your own father would have had your best interests at heart and not continued to do that to you to the point that you puked. And that you have been humiliated and berated for something that you did not ever wish to have happened and would not have if your Dad had stopped giving you drinks when it was more than apparent you were too drunk to know better.

Does your mom know about this? No one wants to make a fool of themselves and ruin anything, you\u2019re not used to drinking and your dad got you wasted, he should be the one everyone\u2019s mad at.

Bartenders would literally be fired over this. \n\nYou definitely didn\u2019t need to drink that much either. You could\u2019ve waited a bit between the first drink to see how you felt.

I have the asian glow gene, 2 normal drinks and I'm drunk. \n\nDaddy kept topping her off and giving her more when she is already inebriated is highly irresponsible, when drunk you are not in the right faculties to make proper decisions. \n\nShe offered to pay for the rug, and that's taking responsibility for her actions.\n\nHer creepy ass dad should answer for why he did what he did now. NTA", "Sounds like they weren't just 3 drinks, but drinks being continuously topped off. I'm sorry but everyone is a newbie at some point, and doesn't know their limit at all. My experience like this was at a halloween party shortly after 21. There was hundreds of jello shots around. I had only drank a beer before and never been drunk. I couldn't even taste the alcohol. I had no idea how strong they were. I had about 10 in a 3 hour period. It was the one and only time I ever semi-blacked out, and the only time I puked after drinking. Luckily I had good friends around that realized I was suddenly way past my limit. They got me to the bathroom, and called my bf (now husband) and he grabbed me and watched over me that night with lots of fluids and some mcd's breakfast. Definitely never made that mistake again, but without experiencing it you have no clue.", "Yeah, but her dad was topping off her drink when she wasn\u2019t even physically able to tell.", "Exactly, OP commented that their dad has ghosted them since Thanksgiving, like what?? To me that's either \"we are ashamed of you\" or dad is SUPER embarrassed because he knows he fucked up.", "I think (hope) your dad is ashamed of himself and is hidding because of that. But he need to come clean, apologise and take the blame : what he did was dangerous. You could have been hurt. Really badly.\nIt's incredible your family doesn't understand that.", "That\u2019s guilt. He did wrong and he is ashamed, but has no contrition. You\u2019ve mentioned elsewhere that he is a jokester? Yeah, sometimes \u201cjokes\u201d aren\u2019t funny", "Young but still an adult. I never said dad wasn\u2019t in the wrong but OP needs to take accountability for his actions.", "Great rule. It\u2019s so easy to think that you are sober until you stand up to visit the bathroom. Then you find out that your legs feel hollow.", "Taking personal responsibility is important. OP knew the drinks were alcoholic and drank long past the point of feeling tipsy.  Dad obviously has some responsibility (how much is hard to say since OP is relying on second hand information) but they still need to own their choices. Anyone that blames others for what they knowingly ingest isn\u2019t ready for the responsibility that comes with that activity.", "Op assumed one cup = one unit of alcohol. Which isn't always the case. 3 cups of alcohol can absolutely be enough to black out. For example, 3 long Island iced teas.", "I just realized in my own vote I tagged them as female.\n\nI think it's because when one comment makes the assumption, and then other commenters read some comments before posting their own, it gets autoflagged in our brains that OP = Female. \n\nI don't know why I assumed, that's my guess.", "In absence of any other information, apart from dad being a \u2018jokester\u2019, why wouldn\u2019t OP trust their dad to give them an appropriate drink? Or to not top their drink up when they were already wasted?\n\n\u201cOh thanks dad\u201d (to an apparently kind and loving parent) is also a full sentence.\n\nIf I were to go full Reddit, I\u2019d ask you what your thoughts are about victim shaming, with specific sub-questions about people whose drinks are spiked. But I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll just leave you to ask yourself those questions"]}
