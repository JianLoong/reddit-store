If you didn't want her to control you, you shouldn't have accepted her money. And the money she spent on your education had to have been a lot more than the money she wants for her dress. If you don't want to be under her control, repay her for what she spent on your college education. You say she's entitled, which she definitely is, but at the same time, despite your dislike of her, you still accepted her money when you needed it. You don't have to pay for her dress. But she also didn't have to pay for your education. So despite your best effort to make her look bad, she did at least one good thing for you, despite whatever her true intentions were.

But this is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nWow, you sister learned the art of controlling people with money from your parents like a master. \n\nStep away from the crazy bride.

Given that she helped you out financially in the past, I would have said it would be gracious to  contribute as much as you feel able for the wedding dress, but now that she's tantrumming and demanding, it's a point of honor not to give in. There is no world that I know of where siblings are obliged to pay for siblings' wedding outfits.", "NTA. and I don't approve of a $10,000 one use dress. What a waste of money", "So your parents are cutting you off for a second time for not doing what they want?  Your sister is throwing a tantie because you won't pay 5k towards her dress.  And of course you don't owe her anything from  her paying your college tuition.  Actually I think all of you ATA.  Some family therapy might be in order.", "INFO how much was the tuition? Can you afford the dress? Either way pay back the money in total. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards YTA bc you owe her money. If she pulled that reason and if you cared about her control you should\u2019ve paid back at first chance.", "ESH. Her and your parents for their ridiculous demand, and you for being so ungrateful for your sister's generosity.", ">She only paid for my tuition because she wanted to control me and make me feel guilty.\n\nOkay, on your question about the dress, not TA. However, some appreciation of her contribution to your education is in order. Tuition is not cheap. If you did not want to owe her a good deed, you should not have accepted the tuition. This entitlement you both have is the reason ESH.\n\nBet you if you repaid the tuition, it would come out to be more than $10,000.  There is an expectation of balance in all relationships. If you do not want the tuition hanging over your head, you need to pay it back. Next time, decline any gifts that throw your relationship off balance (i.e., any gift you cannot or do not want to balance out through money, time, actions, etc.).", "ESH - There isn\u2019t a decent person in this family. Sure she sounds a bit entitled. But she paid half your tuition and you don\u2019t think you owe her because she did it for the wrong reasons? But you still accepted it? Yikes.", "NTA about the dress but if you are financially dependent on your parents at the age of 28, that\u2019s a whole other problem!", "But did her sister give her money, or just transfer the money their parents put aside for her?", "Absolutely not! She doesn\u2019t get to control OP. We only get controlled by someone when we allow it to happen. OP can tell sister to go to hell and be really clear that she doesn\u2019t owe her anything and make lil sis feel like a piece of \ud83d\udca9 for attaching strings to something years later.", "With a family like this, you don't need any enemies.  Seriously, she volunteered to pay your tuition.  You owe her nothing.  I would suggest NC/LC with the family and withdraw from participating in the wedding or even attending.  If you do not pay for her dress, she will certainly bring it up at the reception and then blame you for ruining her big day.", "How did a fifteen/sixteen year old pay for her older sister to go to uni? Such nonsense.", "Either way it doesn\u2019t matter. At that point the money belonged to the sister \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you for pointing that one out too.  Usually I'm better at catching timeline issues.  There are so many of those in these made-up stories.\n\nOften I wait to point out inconsistencies in their replies and how the story builds off conversation with new detail tailored to combat any reason someone thinks they are the asshole, but it gets tiring."]}
