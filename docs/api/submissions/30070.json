You say she's entitled, which she definitely is, but at the same time, despite your dislike of her, you still accepted her money when you needed it. You don't have to pay for her dress.

Given that she helped you out financially in the past, I would have said it would be gracious to  contribute as much as you feel able for the wedding dress, but now that she's tantrumming and demanding, it's a point of honor not to give in. There is no world that I know of where siblings are obliged to pay for siblings' wedding outfits.", "NTA. and I don't approve of a $10,000 one use dress. What a waste of money", "So your parents are cutting you off for a second time for not doing what they want?  Your sister is throwing a tantie because you won't pay 5k towards her dress.  And of course you don't owe her anything from  her paying your college tuition.  Actually I think all of you ATA.  Some family therapy might be in order.", "INFO how much was the tuition? Can you afford the dress? Either way pay back the money in total. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards YTA bc you owe her money. If she pulled that reason and if you cared about her control you should\u2019ve paid back at first chance.", "ESH. Her and your parents for their ridiculous demand, and you for being so ungrateful for your sister's generosity.", ">She only paid for my tuition because she wanted to control me and make me feel guilty.\n\nOkay, on your question about the dress, not TA. However, some appreciation of her contribution to your education is in order. Tuition is not cheap. If you did not want to owe her a good deed, you should not have accepted the tuition. This entitlement you both have is the reason ESH.\n\nBet you if you repaid the tuition, it would come out to be more than $10,000.  There is an expectation of balance in all relationships. If you do not want the tuition hanging over your head, you need to pay it back. Next time, decline any gifts that throw your relationship off balance (i.e., any gift you cannot or do not want to balance out through money, time, actions, etc.).", "ESH - There isn\u2019t a decent person in this family. Sure she sounds a bit entitled. But she paid half your tuition and you don\u2019t think you owe her because she did it for the wrong reasons? But you still accepted it? Yikes.", "NTA about the dress but if you are financially dependent on your parents at the age of 28, that\u2019s a whole other problem!", "But did her sister give her money, or just transfer the money their parents put aside for her?", "Absolutely not! She doesn\u2019t get to control OP. We only get controlled by someone when we allow it to happen. OP can tell sister to go to hell and be really clear that she doesn\u2019t owe her anything and make lil sis feel like a piece of \ud83d\udca9 for attaching strings to something years later.", "With a family like this, you don't need any enemies.  Seriously, she volunteered to pay your tuition.  You owe her nothing.  I would suggest NC/LC with the family and withdraw from participating in the wedding or even attending.  If you do not pay for her dress, she will certainly bring it up at the reception and then blame you for ruining her big day.", "How did a fifteen/sixteen year old pay for her older sister to go to uni?

If you don\u2019t have the money to repay the tuition your parents were likely correct in that degree not being a worthy investment.", "Pretty sure your tuition cost more than her dress.\n\nYTA and so is she.\n\nI'm sorry you're both so bad at relationships.", "YTA.\n\nHow can your sister be spoiled and entitled? It doesn't matter that she had a scholarship, she could have used that money for anything else, but she chose to give it to you so you could pursue your dream. You know she's in a bad relationship and she asked you to be one of the most important people on her special day, and to pay a fraction of the money she handed out to you. Sounds like you're doing some projection when talking about her.", "NTA.

I think all 4 of you suck but if I were you, I\u2019d pay for half of the dress. And pay back any of the tuition she paid for you.

Have you gotten a sustainable job with the degree you wanted .  ( I was an art major, and paid for my own Master's degree plus 30 additional graduate hours.  No loans, no gifts. ).

Then you are free.", "ESH.  Your sister for making a demand to pay for half of her dress.. However, you're also the AH because regardless of her motives she paid for your college tuition.  $5,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount she paid for your college.  I'd pay the $5,000 and write on the check - reimbursement for college tuition.  Go to the wedding.... then afterwards go LC with your sister and parents.   Just ghost them, declining invites due to heavy work load.", "ETA. If you knew that the reason she gave you the money was to control you, then why take it? \nIt sounds like you should just pay her back whatever she gave you.", "YTA\n\nHow much did she give you towards college tuition? if it was 5k or over then yes you should pay for half the dress if it was less than 5k then you should pay that much(if you have that sum available). \n\nYou should be paying her back anyway,  1) so she doesn't have something to hold over your head, 2) because you should pay back something like that-for whatever reason she did it .\n\nYOU accepted it from her(your spoiled younger sister who got a scholarship--did she get it because she threw a tantrum or because she worked her butt off to get it).", "Yta for fake story how does 15-16 year old kid paid your tuition?

I think Liz is back.", "How do you know it was a gift?", "I want to know this as well. If they set aside a certain amount for each kid and someone got a scholar ship.. I think as a parent I would put it towards my other kid? Maybe? Not sure", ">pay half for her dress but then call it even.\n\nIs $5000 really the cost of an art history degree?", "It could be done with a 2 years gap - younger sister finished her hs, got the college money and scholarship and then could hepl the older sister with her tuition fees.   \nSo, theoretically, it could happen.", "No. Whether she likes it or not.  There's already strings attached.  She'd better pay back for the tuition fees or this will always be brought up", "But then the parent can decide. Here the parents did NOT give her any and her sister actuality gave HERS to her. HER scholarship is no one elses business, the money was hers and given by the parents to her.\n\nESH but op needs to settle that debt. If the value is the same as the dress, it's a reasonable request.", "This is true!!!"]}
