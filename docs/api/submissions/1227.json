I\u2019ve swiped her into class multiple times before and this was only the second time I\u2019ve ever asked. On the way over to meeting her I saw another friend of mine and she wanted to rant to me about an assignment grade. Keep in mind my friend who I asked to swipe me in was in the same room just the opposite end and could see me. So when my other friend was done ranting to me I walked over and said hey and went to grab my card so I could get food. My friend then refuses and said I can swipe myself in. I didn\u2019t even argue with her cuz she just broke up with her girlfriend a couple days ago and didn\u2019t wanna start anything. So I said fine and walked off and went to class.

I think I'm understanding that they have compulsory classes, and each student is required to register their presence (\"swipe in\") at the start of class. The obvious way to do this would be with a magnetic / barcode / rfid scanner at the door and a student id card. I think that's what's being described here, and OP was proposing to hand their card to friend 1, then eat lunch while friend 1 took OP's student ID to class with her.\n\nFriend 1 was upset that OP stopped to talk to friend 2 for a few minutes on the way to hand friend 1 their id card, but apparently not upset enough to actually leave and go to class.\n\nI think I'm voting ESH, on the grounds that everyone in this story is ridiculous.", "Info: What actually happened?

But I think you are NTA", "Nah. But I\u2019m honestly not sure what happened or what the issue is", "INFO : How long did you listen to your friend who ranting while the other friend who was waiting to you a favor was twiddling her thumbs? Me, I wouldn\u2019t have waited more than 2 or 3 minutes.", "YTA, if you\u2019re late and asking someone to do you a favor - you don\u2019t make them wait on you to do you the favor. You don\u2019t need to wait on her either. Tell other friend you\u2019ll catch up later for her to rant. Go straight to friend to give her your card to swipe you in and then get your food. \n\nIf you do something nice for someone with the expectation that they will repay you the same way - then you aren\u2019t really doing them a favor. If you do not like how she returned your kindness from past favors then do not do any in the future.", "You said you had your card though so why are you asking her to swipe you in?

We have a card that we use to swipe in for class. I planned on getting my food then heading to class and eating there. And ty for your response", "We have a card reader for class that shows whether or not we attend class. That\u2019s what I meant by \u201cswiping in for class\u201d. Also quick summary\n\nI asked friend 1 to swipe me in so I could get food since it\u2019s lunch time. Oh my way over to friend 1 friend 2 stopped me and wanted to talk about a grade she got on an assignment. That was about 5/6 minutes then I walked over to friend 1 and she said do it yourself. So I walked off and left her alone and went to class. (Info: There was still about 15 minutes before class would start so she would not have been late. Although I would have been late if I had gotten food) (more info: I\u2019ve swiped/signed her in before. Although the last time she asked me to do so i had to wait 15 minutes for her)", "I asked friend 1 to swipe me in for class so I wouldn\u2019t be late and could get food. On the way over to see her I saw friend 2 and stopped to talk with her about a grade she got on a paper. After done talking with friend 2 I walked over to friend 1 and she refused to swipe me in. Saying ur already late and ur gonna stop and talk with a friend. I got frustrated and left her and walked to class so I wouldn\u2019t be late. Normally we would talk to class together but I didn\u2019t want to since she couldn\u2019t do me a simple favor that I\u2019ve done for her multiple times", "The issue for me is that I asked her to swipe me in so I could eat and she said yes. But then said no do it urself cuz she got offended that I stopped by to talk with a different friend. So her issue would be that I made her wait 5/6 minutes while I was talking with my friend.", "About 5/6", "Although in one instance in the past when I swiped her in for class I had to wait for her 15 and she kept asking me to walk to different places.

If you wanted her to help you because you where late but then stopped to talk to someone else you couldn\u2019t have been too worried about being late.", "But you ended up having your card so why did you need to make the point. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the same room. You asked for a favour and then put the blame on her for not walking over? She\u2019s going through a rough time as you said so she probably didn\u2019t want to socialize. Oh but let me guess, you\u2019ve done that for her before so she has to do it for you. If you\u2019re gonna be petty with friends like that why even be friends in the first place", "I wasn\u2019t to worried cuz there was enough time by the time I walked over to my friend. There was still 15 minutes before class started but that\u2019s not enough time for me to get food. But ty for your response"]}
