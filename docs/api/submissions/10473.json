He\u2019s very respectful of our home, cleans up after himself and is very careful even when they\u2019re drinking. The friend got married and now has a step son (3) who is only 6 months older than my son (2.5).\n\nThe mother has never really taught their son manners or how to be respectful in other peoples homes. They just put him in front of the TV when they don\u2019t want to deal with him. So when they come over the kid absolutely destroys my house and in that past would break my sons toys and then hide them. I got tired of fixing his toys or having to throw away toys and I\u2019m extra tired of trying to corral this kid and make sure he doesn\u2019t break anything else. He also doesn\u2019t listen in English not because he\u2019s not capable but because he thinks he can get away with it if you talk in English. His mom only corrects him in Spanish so he\u2019ll only act right or stops if he gets yelled at in Spanish. \n\nSo the past two times they\u2019ve come over I\u2019ve left the more durable but cheaper toys in the living room for them to play with and lock my sons room with his nicer expensive and sentimental toys. My son has made it clear he doesn\u2019t want to share these specific toys also, and the other kid just screams and screams until he can find an opening to rip them from my sons hands. My son is satisfied with just running around and playing normally but the other kids looses his mind if he doesn\u2019t hoard all the toys into one corner to play with. This morning my husband gave me a weird look when I asked if our sons room was still locked since the kids and the other parents woke up before us. So now I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s weird or AH-ish behavior to lock his room.", "created_utc": 1676912390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117drky/aita_for_not_wanting_the_other_kid_to_play_in_my/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does he know about all this and what preventive measures you take? If not, you best get to explaining. Then both you and your husband need to sit the other couple down and have a heart-to-heart about respect in the house. \n\nBut DO NOT try to give them advice on how to discipline and raise their kid.", "NTA \n\nIt's so frustrating when other people's kids destroy your/your kids things. It's kind of you to even have them over again.", "NTA - the other kids behavior is not great and if he is going to trash your sons toys then yes of course you should hide them away somewhere he can't get them. If locking your sons room is the best approach then that's what you should do.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your job to parent other people\u2019s kids. Plus you are just protecting things that your son cares about. I would have done the same thing.  Go on with your bad self Ma.", "Nta. Just let your husband know what's up when you get a chance to speak with him privately", "Nta at all it\u2019s strange you even have to even ask yourself that some parents are just so ignorant", "NTA. Why shouldn't you prioritize your son over a guest, especially one that is out of control and bent on destruction? I bet your son really appreciates that you listen to him and help him protect his possessions the way you do.\n\nAlso, your house, your rules.", "NTA..  if you invite another child over obviously you have to be accommodating (which you are by leaving toys in the living room) but you are entitled to having boundaries especially when someone else\u2019s child is being destructive in your own home!", "NTA.  When you have visitors who you know will mistreat, damage, or destroy certain possessions, it\u2019s entirely reasonable to put those possessions away safely until the visit is over.  This is true whether the problem is pets, kids, or adults.", "NTA  For visiting children, without a record of destruction, I always brought out the more durable toys to share  in a main area and the bedroom and other toys were off limits.  As my child got older they knew anything they brought out was to be shared but friends weren't allowed in the bedroom until much older than these kids (7-8 depending on behavior)", "NTA. I used to have to do this with one of my friend's kids as well. Ya gotta do what ya gotta do.", "NTA. This kid is demon-spawn and his behaviour is being enabled by his parents. Locking is room is necessary to prevent his toys from being broken. Tell them they need to teach their child how to behave if they want him to have access to your son's expensive toys.", "NTA. When you welcome someone into your home it is on them to respect your home.", "NTA. You and your son should not be subjected to this. It's your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There have been plenty of times that I put my kids\u2019 toys in their room and shut the door so the toys wouldn\u2019t get damaged.

The other kid's behavior is governing the privileges he has access to, that's just fair treatment. \n\nBut I would keep an open mind about the other kid, and not necessarily think of them as undisciplined. Kids show a huge range of innate behavior, and there often isn't anyone to blame. I know plenty of families with one wild kid and one mild kid, raised by exactly the same parents.\n\nSo while they shouldn't make their kid's behavior your problem, I wouldn't be quick to judge either as this is probably a frustrating situation for the parents too.", "NTA.
