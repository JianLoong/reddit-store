We each have two kids ages 6,7,8,9 from a previous relationship.\n\nI bought his kids something for Christmas this year. Nothing extravagant but something I know they would enjoy and to know we thought about them. He was aware that I did get them something. We both got each other\u2019s kids a gift last Christmas.\n\nHe did not get my kids anything. My kids saw his kids presents under the tree and expected they would be exchanging gifts. I feel bad having to explain that to my kids and don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\n\nThe kids get along great but he is not really close with my kids. I spoke to him about it and he got upset. He said he didn\u2019t ask me to get them anything and next year not to get them anything to save him the headache.\n\nAITA for getting upset telling him he was selfish and bringing it up at all?\n\nEdit: We do not live together. He had a rocky start when introduced  to my kids after a year of us dating . He was the first person my kids met after my divorce. We spoke about his relationship with my kids recently and he expressed it was hurtful for him because he tried and they rejected him at first. They\u2019re okayish now but it took some time for them to get used to the idea of me dating. So it\u2019s a sensitive subject. Nevertheless this doesn\u2019t help. We did not talk about getting them gifts I made the assumption that he would once he knew I did even if he wasn\u2019t planning to originally.

I can promise you there are more examples of his selfishness if you look.\n\nThat\u2019s three years down the drain.", "NTA,\n\nBeing together nearly 3 years, he should know better.. I bet he was thinking you'd get all the gifts and that you'd just add both your names on all the gifts..", "NTA He sounds like a shitty person to force on your kids.", "Info: Where do you see this relationship going? Three years is not a short amount of time. If by this point he isn\u2019t interested in a relationship with your children you may want to reconsider the relationship and move on.", "So he, as an adult, is withholding affection from your kids because they, as young children, initially rejected him 3 years ago?   And you think it's a good idea to stay with him?   He expects children to handle his grudgy rejection better than him as an adult...  Time for you to take responsibility for the well-being of your kids and lay a hard boundary that if he chooses to withhold affect from your children, you will end the relationship to protect them because they deserve better than that...", "NTA\n\nBut this guy\u2026wow.

Red flags abound. \n\nThis is your significant person, and they couldn\u2019t be arsed to get a friggin\u2019 Amazon gift card, for f*ck\u2019s sake?\n\nI met my wife in November 2020, after a couple weeks talking online.

It was an awkward situation that probably sucked for everyone and you guys should have communicated more about this a month before Christmas. You two should have gotten the kids presents together (from both of you) or he should have known to at least get presents for your kids/ask. This is a communication problem, and an absent minded man problem, but it doesn\u2019t sound like any malice or ill-will was intended.", "What happened previous Christmas? Regardless, partner is an AH\u2026\u2026I know it\u2019s so hard to go online and order gifts.", "NTA the moment he became aware you bought gifts to give his children, he should have bought something for yours, or said \"please return those, I do not want us to exchange gifts with each other's kids.\"\n\nI'd be really hesitant to take this relationship any further.", "Sounds like he is the kid. He needs to grow up. Frankly, it is hurtful for the kids to be singled out especially at Christmas. He's TA. \n\nIf this were me, I would evaluate dating someone who doesn't include your kids.", "NTA You stated that last year there was a gift exchange. It would make sense that you would do the same this year.\n\nI would urge you to reevaluate this relationship though. It seems he\u2019s ambivalent at best regarding your kids. Its common for children to initially reject a parent\u2019s new partner. It\u2019s a red flag that he\u2019s holding on to that rejection. He has kids that experienced a separation. He should have some understanding and compassion since he had to support his own children through a similar transition.", "NTA. Why did he get upset? For being an asshole to kids? \n\nYou just assumed he\u2019s buy them gifts - so sounds like you still have work to do on communication. \n\nSounds like there are more things at play here. It\u2019s normal kids would reject him, especially after a divorce. \n\nHim holding resentment about that 3 years into the relationship does not bode well - and even less so trying to \u2018punish\u2019 the children by not getting them Xmas gifts. \n\nY\u2019all need some relationship counselling. And family therapy if the relationship continues down the line", "Well this relationship is going nowhere. He obviously doesn\u2019t intend for you to even live together next Christmas if he is telling you not to buy his kids anything. \n\n What is the point of this relationship?", "Honestly, this is a wake up call to re-examine what other assumptions you've made about this relationship. Clearly he has no intention of ever moving in or blending families based off of his reaction here. \n\nHis feelings about your children not immediately accepting him are equally concerning and immature. \n\nDo you really see a future with someone who would blame kids for having a negative reaction to an emotionally complicated situation and change they didn't ask for? Come on. \n\nNTA but your self worth could probably use a boost.", "NTA. He sure is, though. \n\nThe second he found out that you were getting gifts for his kids, he should have planned to get something for your kids. \n\nMaybe your kids were picking up on something you missed when they initially rejected him.", "You're dating a man who literally hates your kids.\n\n\nWTF is wrong with you. Please exit this relationship....He couldn't be bothered by your kids...can only imagine what he would say do if you two actually lived together to those poor kids.\n\nStop dating that awful rebound man. It's okay to be by yourself and be single OP. You deserve better....your kids deserve the best. Explain to HOW a man who can say that is worth anyone's attention?!?!\n\n>He said he didn\u2019t ask me to get them anything and next year not to get them anything to save him the headache.", "NTA. He should have known what was expected since you both got each other\u2019s kids gifts last year. Not sure why so many people missed that detail, but to me that means you didn\u2019t need to specifically remind him to get them gifts again. The expectation was already established. He clearly does not want to build a positive relationship with your kids so you should stop wasting your time on him.", "NTA. BUT You realize your partner is supposed to be one of the grown ups in this relationship right? So he didn\u2019t hit it off immediately with your child, so what. If he wants to build a relationship with your son he needs to work at it , like you are with his children. He is demonstrating that he just doesn\u2019t care and isn\u2019t interested to you- and your child. You are letting be dismissive to your child. I would be so out of there with my son. My son would always be first. In this respect you are the AH.", "Perhaps this isn\u2019t the right partner for you.", "NTA.  This whole his feelings were hurt by little kids is ridiculous.  He\u2019s supposed to be the adult.  Add to it that you set a precedent last year and he needs to get on board.", "Dump him. This is a huge red flagz", "*<He was aware that I did get them something.>*\n\n*<The kids get along great but he is not really close with my kids. I spoke to him about it and he got upset.

So that means you choose the kids first and have to be careful when selecting a partner and then allowing that person to be part of you kids life. Anytime the kids are involved you have to consider the long term or you see people on your own and they don\u2019t know. \n\nSo if after 3 years the two sets of kids are interacting and know you\u2019re together but the two of you haven\u2019t made decisions around something as simple as presents - where is this going? And if you don\u2019t know or it is going nowhere - why are your kids involved?

Don't get upset about something that was important to you if the other party wasn't made aware of the magnitude. \n\n2. Your lack of communication made your kids feel bad not your partner. Their expectations were only fueled by your negligence. These are conversations you have before hand because what your partner did isn't inherently bad.

The lesson is to communicate.", "ESH\n\nYes, he's bigger TA but you have a problems with communication. You've been together for almost 3 years.

Both of you, together.", "ESH minus the kids - there was an obvious gap in communication on both y\u2019all\u2019s parts. Frankly, do you really want to continue a relationship with someone who after 3 years isn\u2019t close to your children? If you your response is yes, that also says a lot about you as a parent. A partner of a single parent should always make effort to get to know kids and build a good relationship with them.
