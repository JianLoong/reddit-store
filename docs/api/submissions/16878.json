We often speak multiple times a day. However, some days I\u2019m busy, have nothing interesting to say or just don\u2019t check my phone for a few hours.\n\nThis becomes a problem with my mom. If I don\u2019t answer messages or calls within a few hours I get calls and messages asking if something is wrong. For example I was going wedding dress shopping with a bridesmaid. Mom doesn\u2019t live close, so was unable to come. I sent her pictures of dresses throughout the day and let her know when I\u2019d chosen one. I told her I needed a shoulder covering of some sort, and that we were going to nearby shopping centre to find one. I may have sounded a bit flustered but nothing more than usual pre wedding stresses. 1 and half hours later, my bridesmaids phone rings. It\u2019s my mom, desperately trying to find out if I\u2019m ok. My mom had only met this bridesmaid once, didn\u2019t know her well and certainly didn\u2019t have her number. Apparently, unable to contact me (it was loud in the shopping centre and my signal wasn\u2019t great,) she\u2019d become so concerned she\u2019d contacted my husband to ask for his sisters number (the bridesmaid) and phoned her instead. This was just 1 and half hours after our last contact. \n\nThis may seem a small irritation, except it happens all the time. Yesterday my mom text me first thing in morning. I text back. A few hours later she called. I answered and told her we were about to leave for park. After we spent afternoon gardening. I left my phone inside. \n\nAround 5, just 5 hours after I last spoke with mom, I saw she\u2019d text me to ask if we\u2019d had fun at the park at around 2.30pm. Busy cooking dinner, I intended to text back after eating. I next looked an hour later, she\u2019d sent 2 further messages asking if something was wrong, and had called me. \n\nShe called again at that point. I answered, a little exasperated. She immediately began asking what was wrong. I told her nothing and she needed to stop assuming things were wrong when her adult daughter is out of contact for a few hours. She said her actions were entirely reasonable because in past I\u2019ve had medical issues, non of which were serious. I told her it wasn\u2019t reasonable. In response she said \u2018well I assume with that attitude you are fine then.\u2019\n\nThis made me a bit angry. This happens regularly and I\u2019m fed up being treated like a child when 33 with 2 children of my own. Surely it\u2019s ok to be out of contact with my mom for a few hours? In my annoyance I said her behaviour was bordering on stalkerish and it\u2019s ludicrous to expect me to check in several times a day. This panic about my well being is almost a weekly accordance.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since, but she deleted the messages she sent yesterday. Unsure what that achieves, but she tends to act like a wounded puppy when I bring this up. Each time I feel guilty for hurting her feelings. But should I feel guilty?

It's common for parents who overstep to sulk and pout when their adult children have to initiate a formal boundary to get them to respect time and space. Your mother puts on that attitude because she knows acting like the wounded party either defrays conflict or stifles it altogether and makes the other party feel bad. You need to make it clear that, while you love her deeply, you're an adult who does not need to confirm their whereabouts and status every hour, and that most of the time if you don't get back within two minutes that's not a sign of negativity, that's a sign that you're busy.\n\nBe prepared for guilt trippy nonsense like, \"I'm sorry I love you,\" and other backhanded claims that imply you're being unreasonable.", "NTA and I\u2019d say you could and should go further to set clear expectations and boundaries", "NTA.

The only problem here is if you have an event or chore that runs until 5:15 she will wail that she was frantic and this obviously doesn\u2019t work. A quick text saying, \u201cIn a meeting until six-ish\u201d *should* fix that, but she is likely to do the wounded puppy about that, too.\n\nJust remember that boundaries require consequences.

I say this with the full knowledge that there's a vanishingly small chance you'd actually do it.\n\nYour mom needs therapy, but that's beyond your control.

I'm terrified my mother will have fallen or had a heart attack and no one is there to help her. I worry my husband has been in a car wreck. But she has to learn to recognize that's her issue, not yours. It's not reasonable to let those fears consume you, but it is sometimes hard to manage. She's not coping well, and she's interfering with you being able to live your life with your friends and family.\n\nYou aren't wrong for setting boundaries. You get to decide what your boundaries are. If you would be comfortable with it, could you possibly set up a more healthy agreement like \"mom, I understand you worry about me, but I'm an adult with my own life. I am willing to meet you on this and agree that I will definitely check in (before I go to bed if I have a missed call, within 24/48 hours of a missed call once a day, every other day, once a week, ECT, but what you feel comfortable with and fits your relationship) to help alleviate your anxiety. It's not healthy for you to worry this much while I'm just going about my day.\" If you don't feel comfortable with this, you don't have to. But sometimes knowing a call will be coming can help, because then she has some kind of \"deadline\" she can look to instead of panicking with no end in sight (from her perspective).\n\nDo you know if any reason why your mom might be so worried about you? It's likely not something you're doing, it might just be general anxiety about the world, listening to too much true crime, having lost someone in a sudden way. Has she ever acknowledged that panicking when you haven't called her back in an hour is unreasonable?\n\nI think it would be healthy to at the very least acknowledge her worries, state that you have your own life and that while you don't want to cause her to worry, you don't appreciate feeling constantly tired to your phone and having to check in.

I have always been the responsible one and my sister has also given her reason to be concerned in the past for various reasons.

It may not make her anxiety disappear, but at least you won\u2019t be encouraging negative coping strategies.", "NAH. I get why this is annoying. But it sounds like your mom is dealing with some serious anxiety issues. It is unreasonable to expect you to check in several times a day and always respond.

Moved back to the West Coast from the Midwest in May.

I told her that it felt like she was questioning me, and that she didn\u2019t trust that I was making decisions for reasons or that I wouldn\u2019t update her on my day, and that if she questioned again, I would turn tracking off.

She tells me that I don\u2019t want her in my life, that I\u2019m pushing her away, that I\u2019m telling her she is a bad mother. I find it most useful to remind her in those moments of: (a) the boundary that i am setting (it often differs from the one she is hearing); (b) that i love her; and (c) this is me wanting us to continue to have a close relationship.

You sound like you're getting a cold\" Or \"Did you just wake up?\" or \"Is everything ok?\" I have spoken to her on the phone at around 6pm while walking home from the train station, and she's told me off because it's getting dark and walk quickly and is my husband home, can he meet me etc. She also gets concerned if I don't pick up the phone immediately, and yes has called around to find out if I'm ok. Similar to you, I've been so exasperated at times I've told her to calm down, I'm fine, stop worrying, stop reading into everything. Her response is to get offended, respond in a childish passive-aggressive manner, and then stop talking to me. I think the worst was for a week. And then our lives will intersect again and she continues to act as if it never happened.\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that I can't change it, no matter how much I point out her behaviour, and even when I do it won't change our close relationship. I know she loves me, I know she's childish (now that I'm an adult in a marriage and can view her a bit more from the outside). I have also realized she has always just been an overthinker - when I was a child, she would come into my room to tell me off about something, then come in 10 mins later to continue because she had more to add. She will always be like this, and it's ok now because I don't live with her and I have my own life and family now. I still love her.\n\nPerhaps you're concerned that what you said to your mother might permanently negatively affect your relationship with her; but I suspect, based on how close you are, this will never happen.

My mother did the same thing, until a few months ago. She would call and I would answer, but there was never anything urgent, it was just to chat or speak to the children. Fine, I appreciate her willingness to check in and see how we are. But it got to the point where she would call several times during the day, and if it happened to be a crazy day for me, I wouldn't check my phone from morning until the afternoon. She then would call my husband. When she questioned what she should do if it's an emergency and she can't get through to me, I told her that I should not be her first point of contact and that she should call 911. I ended up having a long conversation with her about boundaries (I am your age) and the fact that I'm a grown woman with kids of my own. It took her a long time to come around, and I still don't think she understands my need to have my own life and be an independent grown up, but she has not been so over the top for a while now.

She never had a father figure and divorced my husband\u2019s dad when he was young, so I think partially she wants him to be the male figure she never really had in her life. He began setting boundaries by telling her that his phone would be off or that he couldn\u2019t text back if he was at work. She\u2019s a bit better now but still has a lot of work to do.

I love my mum but I message her maybe once or twice a month, and less if she or I are busy. I see her maybe 4 times a year (less currently because inflation means I can barely afford the petrol)\n\nWhat you experience (and even with the prior commenter said about 3-4 days) is not the norm. People have different relationships with their parents, some do talk every day, some don't. But for those that talk every day that I've known, it's because they're choosing to. And when they miss a day, their parents don't act as if they've died, been kidnapped, or gone MIA. At most they receive one single text, and then that parent waits patiently for a reply.\n\nBecause when you go out, how often are you anxiously checking your phone to make sure you've not missed a message so she doesn't call your husband or your friends or anyone else?\n\nI don't know if your mum has anxiety, is bored and you're her outlet, or what, and I'm sure everyone else has gotten this through to you, but you need to set clear boundaries. Some practical things that might help on your end could be:\n- having your husband block her number (so she can't use him to reach you)\n- if you use WhatsApp, archiving her conversation. You'll still receive the messages that way, but you won't get notifications.\n- have a set time to check in via text (maybe make it part of a morning routine). If it is anxiety, and you make it part of a routine, and you want to (and only if you want to, not feel like you have to), you could tell her about what you plan to do and where you plan to be and say you'll be busy during the day, so she shouldn't expect any replies until the next morning's check in.\n- have a set day to call, so that she can build routine.\n- encourage your mum to seek therapy or counselling. I'm not a psychiatrist but it sounds like anxious attachment, which might come from past issues she's not worked through. Counselling may help her uncover why she feels like she needs to be in constant contact with you.\n- I'd encourage you to seek therapy or counselling too. As someone who struggles to set boundaries myself, it's been massively helpful in developing my ability to say no.\n- make friends and family aware of any boundaries you set, so that if your mum tries to contact you through them, they can ignore it.", "Agree, great book and helped me out enormously.", "InshaAllah NAH.

My advice is to go no contact for a while so that your mum can seek therapy and heal from her addiction to you.", "NTA for being frustrated, but I'm going to suggest a different approach. \n\nIt sounds like your love your mom and generally like talking to and interacting with her. \n\nIf this is the case, I think you need to sit her down and talk to her about anxiety. She seems to have serious issues with it, and increasing anxiety with age is very common as other signs of mental decline due to age set in. \n\nI'd tell her you love her but that she's having very unrealistic expectations of you, and then ask her where her anxiety comes from. Why does she assume you're hurt instead of just busy? When did these anxieties start? Has she spoken to a doctor? Is she reading media that is exacerbating these anxieties? Will she agree to see a therapist or psychiatrist/psychologist if she has no good answers? \n\nI know reddit is very fast to go into \"Nope, boundary and that's it\", and that is extremely useful for people who are toxic in your life -- but for those you are close to and instead DO make your life better, helping them can be a much better long term approach, as long as they are willing to accept your help and try and help themselves as well.", "Ordered.

Like you I got ill and if I am honest she didn\u2019t handle it well. She is sort of in denial about what happened to me and the life long effects but it made her quite clingy. I recovered enough to start back to work and start living again after a couple of years but I had the same thing with her texting and then calling if I hadn\u2019t replied within a couple of hours and if I didn\u2019t answer then calling my husband. I managed to end things by sitting her down and telling her that just because someone has a mobile phone doesn\u2019t mean they are always available for contact. I am in my 40\u2019s and didn\u2019t have a mobile when I was a teen, I reminded her about how I used to go out and she wouldn\u2019t see or hear from me all day! But what I said about just because the mobile phone exists doesn\u2019t mean someone is always able to talk or even looks at it and expecting me too was an invasion of privacy. I asked her if it would be ok for my boss to do that and of course she said no and it did stick with her. You are NTA but I would suggest a calm chat with her as a starting point. I also reminded her that if I was dead in a ditch somewhere or in trouble that my husband would of course tell her immediately if he knew and if he couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation then she certainly couldn\u2019t and that she needed to stop assuming there was an issue because I didn\u2019t cling to my phone.
