We often speak multiple times a day. However, some days I\u2019m busy, have nothing interesting to say or just don\u2019t check my phone for a few hours.\n\nThis becomes a problem with my mom. If I don\u2019t answer messages or calls within a few hours I get calls and messages asking if something is wrong. For example I was going wedding dress shopping with a bridesmaid. Mom doesn\u2019t live close, so was unable to come. I sent her pictures of dresses throughout the day and let her know when I\u2019d chosen one. I told her I needed a shoulder covering of some sort, and that we were going to nearby shopping centre to find one. I may have sounded a bit flustered but nothing more than usual pre wedding stresses. 1 and half hours later, my bridesmaids phone rings. It\u2019s my mom, desperately trying to find out if I\u2019m ok. My mom had only met this bridesmaid once, didn\u2019t know her well and certainly didn\u2019t have her number. Apparently, unable to contact me (it was loud in the shopping centre and my signal wasn\u2019t great,) she\u2019d become so concerned she\u2019d contacted my husband to ask for his sisters number (the bridesmaid) and phoned her instead. This was just 1 and half hours after our last contact. \n\nThis may seem a small irritation, except it happens all the time. Yesterday my mom text me first thing in morning. I text back. A few hours later she called. I answered and told her we were about to leave for park. After we spent afternoon gardening. I left my phone inside. \n\nAround 5, just 5 hours after I last spoke with mom, I saw she\u2019d text me to ask if we\u2019d had fun at the park at around 2.30pm. Busy cooking dinner, I intended to text back after eating. I next looked an hour later, she\u2019d sent 2 further messages asking if something was wrong, and had called me. \n\nShe called again at that point. I answered, a little exasperated. She immediately began asking what was wrong. I told her nothing and she needed to stop assuming things were wrong when her adult daughter is out of contact for a few hours. She said her actions were entirely reasonable because in past I\u2019ve had medical issues, non of which were serious. I told her it wasn\u2019t reasonable. In response she said \u2018well I assume with that attitude you are fine then.\u2019\n\nThis made me a bit angry. This happens regularly and I\u2019m fed up being treated like a child when 33 with 2 children of my own. Surely it\u2019s ok to be out of contact with my mom for a few hours? In my annoyance I said her behaviour was bordering on stalkerish and it\u2019s ludicrous to expect me to check in several times a day. This panic about my well being is almost a weekly accordance.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since, but she deleted the messages she sent yesterday. Unsure what that achieves, but she tends to act like a wounded puppy when I bring this up. Each time I feel guilty for hurting her feelings. But should I feel guilty?

It's common for parents who overstep to sulk and pout when their adult children have to initiate a formal boundary to get them to respect time and space. Your mother puts on that attitude because she knows acting like the wounded party either defrays conflict or stifles it altogether and makes the other party feel bad. You need to make it clear that, while you love her deeply, you're an adult who does not need to confirm their whereabouts and status every hour, and that most of the time if you don't get back within two minutes that's not a sign of negativity, that's a sign that you're busy.\n\nBe prepared for guilt trippy nonsense like, \"I'm sorry I love you,\" and other backhanded claims that imply you're being unreasonable.", "NTA and I\u2019d say you could and should go further to set clear expectations and boundaries", "NTA.
