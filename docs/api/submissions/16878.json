We often speak multiple times a day. However, some days I\u2019m busy, have nothing interesting to say or just don\u2019t check my phone for a few hours.\n\nThis becomes a problem with my mom. If I don\u2019t answer messages or calls within a few hours I get calls and messages asking if something is wrong. For example I was going wedding dress shopping with a bridesmaid. Mom doesn\u2019t live close, so was unable to come. I sent her pictures of dresses throughout the day and let her know when I\u2019d chosen one. I told her I needed a shoulder covering of some sort, and that we were going to nearby shopping centre to find one. I may have sounded a bit flustered but nothing more than usual pre wedding stresses. 1 and half hours later, my bridesmaids phone rings. It\u2019s my mom, desperately trying to find out if I\u2019m ok. My mom had only met this bridesmaid once, didn\u2019t know her well and certainly didn\u2019t have her number. Apparently, unable to contact me (it was loud in the shopping centre and my signal wasn\u2019t great,) she\u2019d become so concerned she\u2019d contacted my husband to ask for his sisters number (the bridesmaid) and phoned her instead. This was just 1 and half hours after our last contact. \n\nThis may seem a small irritation, except it happens all the time. Yesterday my mom text me first thing in morning. I text back. A few hours later she called. I answered and told her we were about to leave for park. After we spent afternoon gardening. I left my phone inside. \n\nAround 5, just 5 hours after I last spoke with mom, I saw she\u2019d text me to ask if we\u2019d had fun at the park at around 2.30pm. Busy cooking dinner, I intended to text back after eating. I next looked an hour later, she\u2019d sent 2 further messages asking if something was wrong, and had called me. \n\nShe called again at that point. I answered, a little exasperated. She immediately began asking what was wrong. I told her nothing and she needed to stop assuming things were wrong when her adult daughter is out of contact for a few hours. She said her actions were entirely reasonable because in past I\u2019ve had medical issues, non of which were serious. I told her it wasn\u2019t reasonable. In response she said \u2018well I assume with that attitude you are fine then.\u2019\n\nThis made me a bit angry. This happens regularly and I\u2019m fed up being treated like a child when 33 with 2 children of my own. Surely it\u2019s ok to be out of contact with my mom for a few hours? In my annoyance I said her behaviour was bordering on stalkerish and it\u2019s ludicrous to expect me to check in several times a day. This panic about my well being is almost a weekly accordance.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since, but she deleted the messages she sent yesterday. Unsure what that achieves, but she tends to act like a wounded puppy when I bring this up. Each time I feel guilty for hurting her feelings. But should I feel guilty?

It's common for parents who overstep to sulk and pout when their adult children have to initiate a formal boundary to get them to respect time and space. Your mother puts on that attitude because she knows acting like the wounded party either defrays conflict or stifles it altogether and makes the other party feel bad. You need to make it clear that, while you love her deeply, you're an adult who does not need to confirm their whereabouts and status every hour, and that most of the time if you don't get back within two minutes that's not a sign of negativity, that's a sign that you're busy.\n\nBe prepared for guilt trippy nonsense like, \"I'm sorry I love you,\" and other backhanded claims that imply you're being unreasonable.", "NTA and I\u2019d say you could and should go further to set clear expectations and boundaries", "NTA.

If you want to, you can choose a time that is generally convenient to you \u2014 say, 5 pm \u2014 and say that if you have been unavailable during the day you will check for messages then. The only problem here is if you have an event or chore that runs until 5:15 she will wail that she was frantic and this obviously doesn\u2019t work. A quick text saying, \u201cIn a meeting until six-ish\u201d *should* fix that, but she is likely to do the wounded puppy about that, too.\n\nJust remember that boundaries require consequences. Something like, \u201cMom, this is out of control.

I say this with the full knowledge that there's a vanishingly small chance you'd actually do it.\n\nYour mom needs therapy, but that's beyond your control. You need therapy to help you understand how to set and maintain reasonable boundaries and why this is good for both of you. Please consider doing this.", "NTA. Tell your mom you will answer her once a day/week, etc. Whatever timeframe works for you. Any additional messages she sends won\u2019t be answered.

I'm terrified my mother will have fallen or had a heart attack and no one is there to help her. I worry my husband has been in a car wreck. But she has to learn to recognize that's her issue, not yours. It's not reasonable to let those fears consume you, but it is sometimes hard to manage. She's not coping well, and she's interfering with you being able to live your life with your friends and family.\n\nYou aren't wrong for setting boundaries. You get to decide what your boundaries are. If you would be comfortable with it, could you possibly set up a more healthy agreement like \"mom, I understand you worry about me, but I'm an adult with my own life. I am willing to meet you on this and agree that I will definitely check in (before I go to bed if I have a missed call, within 24/48 hours of a missed call once a day, every other day, once a week, ECT, but what you feel comfortable with and fits your relationship) to help alleviate your anxiety. It's not healthy for you to worry this much while I'm just going about my day.\" If you don't feel comfortable with this, you don't have to. But sometimes knowing a call will be coming can help, because then she has some kind of \"deadline\" she can look to instead of panicking with no end in sight (from her perspective).\n\nDo you know if any reason why your mom might be so worried about you? It's likely not something you're doing, it might just be general anxiety about the world, listening to too much true crime, having lost someone in a sudden way. Has she ever acknowledged that panicking when you haven't called her back in an hour is unreasonable?\n\nI think it would be healthy to at the very least acknowledge her worries, state that you have your own life and that while you don't want to cause her to worry, you don't appreciate feeling constantly tired to your phone and having to check in. And that you will not be open to discussion on the topic.\n\nIf she would be open to it, your mom would probably benefit from exploring this in therapy.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds EXACTLY like my grandmother.

I have always been the responsible one and my sister has also given her reason to be concerned in the past for various reasons.

You\u2019re going to need to set boundaries and then maintain them. Without meaning to, you have normalized and accommodated her behavior. The only way to change that is to change your behavior. It may not make her anxiety disappear, but at least you won\u2019t be encouraging negative coping strategies.", "NAH. I get why this is annoying. But it sounds like your mom is dealing with some serious anxiety issues. It is unreasonable to expect you to check in several times a day and always respond. But maybe you could (when tempers have cooled) set some expectations with her. What would make her feel OK? A response to a text within a few hours? A daily call/text? What would work for you and ease her anxiety. There might not be a middle ground, but if you try to meet her where she is, she might feel heard and loved enough that she eases up. \u2764\ufe0f", "Nope. NTA. And not a small irritation.\n\nBut highly agree with what was already mentioned about setting boundaries and sticking to them. You also need to have some serious discussions with your husband and close friends about not enabling her and sticking to \"she's fine and you need to wait for her to call you\".\n\nMight also suggest that she seek assistance to find the root cause of why she has this incessant need to contact you throughout the day and given some real coping mechanisms here and and that you're simply done with it.", "Set some boundaries! Tell her you can talk once a day and thats it. Even that is a lot but it may be a good start for her.", "NTA. My mom used to say, \"You don't HAVE to check in every day, but why wouldn't you do such an easy thing for someone you love?\"\n\nIt took years of enforcing boundaries to train her (I'm 38 now, and this took literally from age 25-32). I would not text back for days or weeks because if I engaged, I'd start getting 25 texts a day again. We have a really nice relationship now, and she overtexts sometimes but no longer does the \"are you ok? Call me!\" panic if she doesn't hear back from me for a few days. I was very clear with her that it's my husband's job to worry if he doesn't hear from me, he's my daily check-in, not her.", "My mom used to behave the same way, and it took a few extremely bad fights, and giving her very strict boundaries that I essentially ignored her for a year because she kept violating them for her to finally catch on. Even now she still pushes them and I shut her down the moment she tries.", "It sounds like you need to remind her you aren\u2019t her emotional support animal, just maybe using some different words.  \nMore seriously figure out how often you\u2019re willing to have her call each day and what the consequences will be for her harassing you or the people around you because you\u2019re not calling back when she thinks she should. I suggest she can call once a day, you\u2019ll answer/respond at your convenience. Following the call up with \u201care you okay\u201d or \u201ccall me I\u2019m worried\u201d texts are unacceptable and will be ignored. You\u2019ll still call her when it works for you. You do not promise to speak to her every day as your a busy adult who doesn\u2019t always have time to return calls (and sometimes you just don\u2019t want to talk and that\u2019s fine). You can increase the time between calls and texts and whatnot until you find a level of communication that works for you. Also remind her that if something is wrong and you need her you or your husband will call, but he will be the first person you call, not her, and she really needs to step back into her place.", "NTA. Your mom sounds very similar to mine, so I really feel for you. You are not a bad daughter! But continuing your relationship without boundaries could eventually stress you out to the point where you say something you really can\u2019t take back.  Here is what has helped me, for whatever it\u2019s worth :)\n\nMultiple calls a day: I answer the first. When the second one comes in, I text her to ask if everything is ok. When she responds that she\u2019s fine and just wants to chat, I text back something like \u201cok, thanks for letting me know! looking forward to having a chat tomorrow!\u201d\n\nNeeding to know my whereabouts: I had location tracking on as recently as 2020. Moved back to the West Coast from the Midwest in May. She wasn\u2019t with me because COVID, and was following my journey, texting me at each detour to ask why I was going that way (knowing i was driving a u-Haul by myself). I told her that it felt like she was questioning me, and that she didn\u2019t trust that I was making decisions for reasons or that I wouldn\u2019t update her on my day, and that if she questioned again, I would turn tracking off. She did, within hours, I turned it off. Haven\u2019t felt the need to turn it on again. \n\nIn general, every time I set a boundary, she feels attacked. She tells me that I don\u2019t want her in my life, that I\u2019m pushing her away, that I\u2019m telling her she is a bad mother. I find it most useful to remind her in those moments of: (a) the boundary that i am setting (it often differs from the one she is hearing); (b) that i love her; and (c) this is me wanting us to continue to have a close relationship. And remaining calm while doing so. She gets to have her own reaction, but that reaction isn\u2019t any of my business as long as I am not actually causing harm. After she gets over the initial shock, she has always continued wanting a relationship\u2014the key for me has been to remain firm, loving, and calm. Good luck OP.", "NTA. Your mother needs to find some friends and hobbies. How exhausting for you.", "OP, I went through something similar and I literally had to say, \"I'm talking to you twice a week, and no more than that outside of an emergency. You can call me fifty times, and I won't answer except the two times a week. If it's an emergency, text me and tell me, and I'll call you back.\" But this person literally would call me 5+ times a day for at least a year before she finally gave up and accepted my boundaries. I'll also say that any time she called, I specifically mentioned that her call was one of two for a week. This person started realizing they didn't want to waste their calls.\n\nOP, you're not overthinking this, your mom lacks boundaries. Enforce some.", "My mum is a bit like that. We usually talk every three days. She seldom is the one who calls, but used to be super worried and angry if I did not call her for more than three days. f One day I had enough and told her \"you know what, if there was something wrong you were among the first people to know for sure. So \"no news is good news\", if you hear nothing from us please just asume we are happily living on.\" She obviously had never thought about it like this, and she is really much less worried and less complaining since. \n\nBeing close to your mother is not wrong as such, but if your mother is elderly, behind all this there could be a problem like loneliness or the fear of getting frail and helpless. \n\nNTA, OP, I hope you and your mother find a solution which enables you to have your mother in your life without her getting on your nerves so much. Good luck!", "Yeah it kinda sounds like she has some anxiety or something that should probably be treated.", "It\u2019s not for husband to set a boundary that OP hasn\u2019t set in 33 years\u2026!! \n\nI think a husband who\u2019s been around long enough to create 2 children with OP knows pretty clearly that OP has absolutely zero boundaries with her mother. \n\nOP - YTA for being surprised *today* that your mum doesn\u2019t respect boundaries that you have never created!\n\nGood news is that you can start creating them now. But it will be hard work. \n\nThere will be \u201cextinction die-off\u201d behaviours from your mum (she will act WORSE as you try to create boundaries, to try to get you to give up) so you need to be prepared for that. \n\nRead up on healthy boundaries. Give them a try. Totally worth it.", "I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d phrase it as \u201cwanting,\u201d they\u2019ve already arrived at fully-enmeshed land! It\u2019s just that OP is finally waking up and doesn\u2019t want to be there anymore.", "I'm about halfway through it, it's so good!  Even after 20 years of working to figure out this kind of stuff, I'm still learning new things.", "I, honestly, just stopped picking up my mother's calls. She would call me every day when she was on her way home from work or wherever. The calls were awful, it would be things like what she ate for lunch, or about her horse, but it was the same conversation over and over again. So I just stopped picking up. And when I did, she got pissed. Told me I had an attitude, and was like what if I was in an accident, you should always pick up. I was like well if you were in an accident I would hope you would call 911, and if it's actually something bad, they will call me.", "I don\u2019t mean he should be setting boundaries for OP\u2019s mother, I mean as a standard response, he shouldn\u2019t be giving someone else\u2019s contact info to *anyone* without permission. In this case it just happened to be Stalker Mom.  \n\nIn this case, that stance would have coincidentally helped OP with the lack of boundaries.  \nOP replied that in this case that the brother/sister duo were kind of okay (if a bit perplexed on the sister\u2019s part) with that aspect. I myself would\u2019ve seriously irked, but that\u2019s just me.", ">It literally undermined my position at work, which she didn't understand.\n\nCan I just say that it's bullshit that victims of stalking and abuse get punished by workplaces for being victims? Like, you didn't do this. It's no different than if any other crazy person showed up to harass you. Unless the victim is enabling crazy people by like, allowing them into locked areas or something, it should be illegal to punish someone because someone unhinged is hurting them.", "I'm so sorry. My mother also called the police on me and they came to do a welfare check. Mum and dad had travelled to my house (6hr drive for precisely this reason) to do an uninvited \"intervention\" and we weren't their because we went away for a weekend break. So they went back home and called the police. Annoying doesn't cover it.", "He probably put a stop to I long ago. Or she\u2019s using your medical history as an excuse. If you can\u2019t speak to her maybe therapy is in order", "It definitely isn't the norm at all!", "Your mom is possibly suffering from generalized anxiety, OCD, or a combination of the two. The incessant, frantic calling/texting makes me think it may be OCD. She needs therapy and possibly meds. \n\nIt would be kind of you to start ramping down the contact by making some excuses: \u201cI won\u2019t be available to talk all day tomorrow but will text you to say goodnight,\u201d or \u201cI feel I\u2019m too attached to my phone and am making conscious choices to limit screen time and talk/text. I\u2019ll talk to you on Saturday.\u201d \n\nYou have to be the one to take charge and cut her contact down. By always responding, you are keeping her on a continuous feedback loop - worry, worry, Ah she\u2019s ok. Worry worry really worry, call friend, Ah she\u2019s ok. Break the cycle.\n\nNAH. Just a frantic mother and a daughter who is conditioned to respond.", "We could speculate but l think a frank discussion is needed between you and her.  She clearly has boundary issue, combined with somewhat neurotic mind worrying and stressing about your wellbeing, means she will continue like this until you are in your 60's.  You need to sort this out.\n\nIs your dad in the picture?  Is he as neurotic as her or much less anxious?  It may be worth talking to him before discussion with her.", "It's also on Blinkist!", "NTA but OP you need to stop giving her what she wants, she will never improve if you don't stop answering like this.", "you need to give MarsNirgal's mother another chance. After all, she's THEIR mother!", "Oh, it's a very short conversation in Whatsapp, not a hour-long call. Just a few messages to check how are things going, how are we, and all that while we're both doing also other things (me working, usually, her catching up with friends and my siblings).", "Enjoy your anxiety and teaching your child and those around you that you don't care enough about yourself to help yourself.", "My mother is like this, I don't speak to her daily but her persistence if I don't answer the phone is intrusive. One day I had 21 missed calls, 3 texts a voicemail and a link sent where she had attempted to use some sort of find my friend thing, my teen daughter received 3 missed calls also. I would have called back but by the time I looked at my phone I already had 7 missed calls and 2 texts within an hour. I knew she was OK going on the messages but I was pissed at the persistence. I've tried telling her I don't believe that it's necessary or fair for anyone to behave like that, I've taught my teen kids to respect boundaries. Call once and text, I don't intentionally ignore anyone (except my mother that persistent day) if it's an emergency I will stop what I am doing and call. I don't need 6 missed calls to ask for money. If I'm not answering I'm not near my phone or busy. Precisely why all my social media active statuses are off, if I want to socially interact I will but I won't be forced to do so...\nEdit: NTA", "NTA\n\nYOU HAVE MY FAMILY. This was my exact situation.\n\nGuess what? It didn't stop, it got worse and the resentment and annoyance at me not replying increased. \n\nYou won't stop being treated like a child. They will write out messages intended to cause a reaction and then delete them. \n\nI am a married adult as well but it didn't change the terrifying level of control they thought they had over my every minute. I HAD to be near my phone all the time. Even an hour's silence would result in a mood. \n\n\nI'm NC now and I'm finally starting to live.", "I feel.bad for both OP and her.mum.\n\nThe fear is real and sometimes it's really hard to control your (irrational) worry about your adult children. \n\nBut it's also hugely smothering and guilt-inducing for those adult children.\n\nI constantly worry about my adult children and fight to keep a lid on it and not contact them unecessarily - I'm not sure if my fear stems from almost losing my youngest to cancer when she was 1, or if it goes further back into my childhood. \n\nAn example: my son, 23, flew from the UK to Virginia last year. My partner decided to track his flight. At one point he said he'd been diverted and my worry about him flying, despite us flying long-haul together many times, escalated to the point of me being glued to the bathroom until I knew he'd landed safe. Wtaf? The scenarios in my head about what might've happened to him, JFC *eye roll* ...\n\nSo, my advice would be to understand that OP's mum worries irrationally, but that OP needs to set firm boundaries. A sit-down led by OP about how to move forward, explaining that she will stick to those boundaries at all times. So, validating how OP's mum feels but at the same time creating a structure for their relationship going forward. Mum may also benefit from therapy, I imagine.", "NTA. It can be hard to establish boundaries sometimes, but it\u2019s necessary for your well being - and hers.
