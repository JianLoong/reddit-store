I feel like that way of thinking is very common and if there is anything to the contrary, then it must be discussed up front when you move in. Otherwise, don't be surprised if it happens.\n\nThe only thing that would've truly been a jerk move, from previous experience,  was if someone took the last egg, or maybe we should say two, for eggs, without first buying a replacement, so that you're all never out. I cannot say 100% that she wouldn't have done that though, so I cannot call her a major jerk either.
