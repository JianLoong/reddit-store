I told my sister this, she told me off for believing that her friend could harm me. But then she told me I'll have to sleep in the living room then, I asked why I can't share a room with my nephew, I'll have a mattress on the floor it's ok for me. She said that's his space and he's a boy, so we shouldn't share a room. \n\nI told her it would be very uncomfortable to just sleep on the middle of the living room, she told me it's either that or stop being homophobic and share a room with her friend. I argued that I'm not homophobic because I'm treating her as I would treat any other person who I do not know, she said I was a homophobic asshole. Is she right here?

OP doesn\u2019t want to sleep in the same bed as someone who is attracted to her gender, whether it be male or female. To call that homophobic as some are doing is nonsense.", "Yeah YTA", "No. The body parts one might accidentally come into contact with are different.", "I responded before the edit. I can't help feeling it's a bit convenient that she remembered to add this info after being called out. I'd have expected it to be front and centre.", "Missed the sharing a bed - but the sofa is still a perfectly reasonable option in my view.", "OP is insisting on staying with her sister's family in a full house for a few weeks. She's been given the option of sleeping on the couch and the option of sharing a room with the sister's friend and doesn't like either. She should get a hotel if those options don't work.

Obviously.", "[deleted]", "Why wouldn't she be concerned that someone attracted to her sex who is sleeping in the same bed as her might come on to her?

OP is homophobic", "I mean it's not like that, because lesbians aren't straight men. \n\nIt's perfectly fair for OP to say she doesn't want to share a bed with a stranger and would be uncomfortable doing that. I'm a lesbian and I certainly wouldn't want to share a bed with a stranger of any gender and sexual orientation, because that's way too weird and uncomfortable for me. But imo yeah it's homophobic for OP to say it's because the friend is a lesbian and focus on that, and it's homophobic to say that lesbians should be seen like straight men in this situation. We absolutely do not live in a culture where that is the case. \n\nLesbians (and btw I'm fully including trans lesbians here, I do *not* want to see any TERF nonsense) are in women's dorms, women's locker rooms, and women's bathrooms, and like...if you're uncomfortable with that, sorry, you're homophobic.

I'm female-bodied and have shared beds with female-attracted friends both male and female, but the key there is that they were *friends.* If I was being told I'd need to share a bed with a stranger it wouldn't matter to me if they were asexual, I don't know them and that is beyond my comfort zone, I will take the couch thankyouverymuch.  \n\n\nThe situation is nowhere near the same, but I am reminded of one time my best friend thought I wasn't comfortable with a certain doctor doing a gynecological exam on me because they were a lesbian and said 'she's not going to hit on you when you're in the stirrups or anything!' Like no, I am not at all worried about that. It is a medical procedure. I trust a medical professional to be professional. I don't care if it's done by a man or a woman, gay or straight. However, I would prefer that I see the medical professional sticking things into my genitals only in a professional setting. I do not want to go over to their house and have dinner with them the next week. Which is exactly what would've happened if I'd taken her advice and gone to her doctor stepmother.", "If it was a straight friend (girl) it would be different for me because I would know she won't see me in any inappropriate way, it's like if it was a gay (boy) friend vs a straight boy friend", "It just seems like such a lesser point to \"yo, I don't want to share a bed with a complete stranger.\" That's more than enough reason, and something almost everyone would agree on, but it's not even what OP put in her post title.\n\nShe's NTA for not wanting to share a bed (or even a bedroom) with a stranger, but she's making life harder on herself, and alienating her sister, by focusing on the woman's sexuality.", "Agreed. YTA OP.\n\nYour sister is right, you are being homophobic. Saying you wouldn't mind sharing a room with someone who is straight as much as you would your sister's friend who is a lesbian, is homophobic.

I thought you were saying she could share a room with the friend but not have to share a bed.", "No. She said  a straight FRIEND.

Regardless of who it is race, gender, sexual orientation you should always be cautious about who you are around especially when you would be sleeping in the same bed. It is absolutely valid for her to see the women in this context as a straight man aka possible predator it is not homophobic in the slightest.", "Its not homophobic because women can be predators just like men.\n\nWomen can be abusers, just like men.\n\nGay men can be abusers/predators like straight men. Stop trying to make it seem like some people can't be evil due to their sexuality.\n\nThis isn't a closed semi-public space (like a public restroom, locker room, or even dorms). This is a private space, sharing the same *damned bed*.\n\nIf you want to compare it to a locker room, its a locker room where you have to shower under the same shower head as a random stranger every day. Yeah, this surely is weird.", "\u2026 really not liking the insinuation that no women can be predators. The justification being that you rarely get privacy from them isn\u2019t a strong argument either. Just because it\u2019s not as common as it is with men doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. \n\nHaving experienced abuse from both genders I think OP has a right to say what strangers she will share a bed with and no one else has a right to judge.", "Talking purely from a sexual attraction perspective, how would it be any different to a straight man?\n\nThis is a genuine curious question. I am interested in how it is different. Why?", "It shouldn\u2019t be a different story really. A double bed is not very large. I wouldn\u2019t want to share a double bed with someone I only just met, irrespective of their orientation.

If it was about not wanting to sleep with a stranger\u2014 I definitely understand. I could never. I wouldn\u2019t care who they were. But you very clearly care that this woman is a lesbian. You\u2019d be fine sleeping in the bed with a straight woman so your sister is absolutely correct. Get a motel or hotel room for your visit since you\u2019re so uncomfortable and homophobic.", "FYI just because she is gay doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be attracted to you and want to do anything with you. My guess is your distaste for lesbians comes across in person too and makes you even more unattractive.", "do you think people see every person that aligns with their sexuality in an inappropriate way? Thats kinda weird ngl.\n\nWhy would a straight girl be different? Your main argument to why you\u2019d feel uncomfortable is that she\u2019s a stranger, which would make you NTA, but you\u2019re bringing sexuality in this and your reasonings for that don\u2019t complement the previous reason.", "That\u2019s what makes this homophobia and you homophobic. You don\u2019t care that they\u2019re a stranger at all.", "Well if the friend was male of any orientation, then by your reasoning they should have a problem sharing with you.\n\nJust because someone likes some women doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to be interested in you. Or if they were, that they\u2019d do anything. Of course this is someone you haven\u2019t met, so you don\u2019t have any comfort established with them, but it\u2019s also inappropriate to be thinking of them as a potential predator.", "I am a gay woman and share beds with my straight friends all the time and I have never once thought about doing anything to them.

Thank you.", "You clearly choose to misunderstand. The fact that OP said herself that she would be okay sharing a room with a straight woman she does not know over a lesbian, is homophobic.

But regardless if she is or is not, not sleeping with people who may be sexually attracted to you is a reasonable boundary and not itself a homophobic distinction, and she is stating it reasonably and not homophobically.", "OP has made multiple comments below that show she\u2019s clearly homophobic.

OP is making that difference based off sexuality and that is what makes this homophobic.\n\nIf she was really just uncomfortable sharing a room with a stranger, a woman she doesn't know, she would also feel uncomfortable sharing it with a straight woman. The question of sexuality wouldn't even be brought up here.", "Yes", "So because you find other people annoying, you decided to call me names? Do better.", "so the point of them being a stranger is irrelevant then. i dont get why you think that because someone is attracted to women, they\u2019re not only attracted to all women but also ready to pounce at any chance.", "So I am right then? She likens sleeping with a lesbian to the same as sleeping with a straight man and assumes they will both try to hit on her?"]}
