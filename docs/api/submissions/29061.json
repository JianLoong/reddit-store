And also like I said in the post, I understood in the first place that I worded my initial question to Kate badly.\n\nThe thing that I didn\u2019t understand was how it seemed like I was making fun of Kate. I do understand now after people explained and after what Kate said when I did talk to her about it that it was because it just didn\u2019t seem like a question that anyone would ask seriously.\n\nSo on Friday afternoon I went to Kate and told her, \u201cHey, I wanted to say sorry about yesterday. I get now that I asked a really inappropriate question and I\u2019m sorry for making you uncomfortable. And I understand that you felt like I was making fun of you, but that wasn\u2019t my intention and I\u2019m sorry it came out sounding that way.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cOkay, hold on. You were really just trying to ask about the germs in milk or whatever it was?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cYeah. I know it sounded bad but I swear that\u2019s all I meant.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cWell, if it was a genuine question then I\u2019m sorry also. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed ill intent.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Like I said, I am sorry.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nAnd then that was the end of the conversation and everything seemed fine.  \n", "created_utc": 1697492797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179hqly/update_aita_for_asking_my_coworker_what_would/", "score": 1450, "replies": ["That was big of Kate... glad it worked out.

Now, in such a situation, I know I hold an insane amount of power and I basically have 2 options, and each come with their own consequences:\n\nOption 1: I choose to get offended, I choose to be busy with other things and I blow them off, I tell them to \u201cgo exducate themselves\u201d (which is exactly what they\u2019re trying to do by going straight to the source as they\u2019re asking about my personal experience, which can\u2019t be looked up online unless I run a personal blog or something). Now, again, I could very well be their first wheelchair-bound person. How do you think that would affect them? OP gave you the answer: They are likely to never approach another wheelchair-bound person with a question again. They may never even ask another question again, period. How sad is that? They have now had a negative experience with a member of a certain group and, in the worst case scenario, it leads them to think lesser of said group. They don\u2019t know not everyone is the same. That\u2019s why they wanted to ask questions: To gain knowledge, to not be ignorant. Again, worst case scenario, this leads to bigotry, and guess who could\u2019ve prevented that but chose not to? It\u2019s self-sabotage. It\u2019s quite literally askinng for inequality to be victorious. It\u2019s a guaranteed fail. \n\nOption 2: I recognize that their question is well-intentioned as they come from a place of total ignorance. Ignorance in this instance having the original meaning of \u201ctotal lack of knowing\u201d, not the more modern association with intentional hatred and prejudice.
