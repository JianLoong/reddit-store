{"id": 29061, "submission_id": "179hqly", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for asking my coworker what would happen if I drank her breastmilk?", "selftext": "So first I guess I need to explain a couple of things that people missed in my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1771bhe/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_what_would_happen_if/), mainly that I am 20/F even though most people were for some reason assuming that I was a guy. And also like I said in the post, I understood in the first place that I worded my initial question to Kate badly.\n\nThe thing that I didn\u2019t understand was how it seemed like I was making fun of Kate. I do understand now after people explained and after what Kate said when I did talk to her about it that it was because it just didn\u2019t seem like a question that anyone would ask seriously.\n\nSo on Friday afternoon I went to Kate and told her, \u201cHey, I wanted to say sorry about yesterday. I get now that I asked a really inappropriate question and I\u2019m sorry for making you uncomfortable. And I understand that you felt like I was making fun of you, but that wasn\u2019t my intention and I\u2019m sorry it came out sounding that way.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cOkay, hold on. You were really just trying to ask about the germs in milk or whatever it was?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cYeah. I know it sounded bad but I swear that\u2019s all I meant.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cWell, if it was a genuine question then I\u2019m sorry also. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed ill intent.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Like I said, I am sorry.\u201d\n\nKate said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nAnd then that was the end of the conversation and everything seemed fine.  \n", "created_utc": 1697492797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179hqly/update_aita_for_asking_my_coworker_what_would/", "score": 187, "replies": ["That was big of Kate... glad it worked out. Please google before asking questions like that in future, it'll save a lot of pain.", "I\u2019m glad it worked out OP! And to answer your original original question, your adult gut biome would absolutely decimate any bacteria Kate had to offer. You should work in biology! Rife with socially inept people who are curious about the human body (myself included lol)", "OP I also ask questions like this. It\u2019s good to say like \u201cI have a very silly question about breast milk are you comfortable talking about it?\u201d", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1771bhe/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_what_would_happen_if/)", "Omg I\u2019m so glad, I\u2019m not gonna lie I giggled at the first post bc I had *just* watched a video where a girl says she is selling her breast milk (The Button dating show by The Cut on YouTube)so I thought it was a *totally* valid question (bc I assumed you were a woman, it\u2019d automatically be weird if you were a dude) until I read the comments. \n\nI\u2019m happy y\u2019all cleared it up!", "How about this?  In the future, if you are as prone to asking goofy assed questions as it seems you are, when you are thinking of asking a question about something that is quite personal or that could come off as strange, take a few moments (at least) to consider if you SHOULD ask the question.  It will save you a lot of headaches in the future.  Puking out random thoughts is more likely to rub people wrong than anything else.", "And everybody cheered! That\u2019s nice it turned out for the good", "I missed this original post, but I assumed you were asking if you could get an immunity boost from drinking her breast milk, not the other way around! I seriously miss having some on-ha d for the antibacterial properties. It worked way better than Neosporin on everyone in our household!", "As someone whose partner was pregnant and breastfeeding at some point, I can attest that breastmilk is delicious and I enjoyed partaking once in a while.\n\nTMI, I'm sure, but highly recommended.", "I do not for one second believe you are a woman. I think this is an attempt to CYA. And you should be fired", "Hey, that's a good thing to hear, I'm glad you approached Kate and apologised and did a mea culpa.", "I'll probably never ask another question in my life after this.", "Or come ask the folks in NoStupidQuestions.", "It actually has great health benefits as well. But for some reason people get weird about human milk.", "...their initial post said they were.", "I just saw your OG post.. yeah, just saying that randomly is so out of pocket.. \ud83d\udc80 but it's big of you to apologize to her and try to make things right.\n\nTo answer your question though, about breastmilk (I'm sure you googled it but if you haven't, lmao), you'd probably be fine drinking it? Many people believe that breastmilk has properties that can benefit certain things (if you don't know, there is communities out there of body builders, cancer patients, etc. that seek out to buy breastmilk), but the one thing that benefits the most from breastmilk, are babies.\n\nBreastmilk has the required nutrients for babies to grow, and as they grow, your body continues to get the right amount of nutrients for them to continue growing properly. I think the only way you'd get sick, is if you were lactose intolerant..

That includes biblical relations.", "Please don't, until you develop common sense.", "It can be difficult for some people to produce enough milk for their babies, they are usually exhausted already, and weird modesty traditions interfere with many women being able to red babies when the babies want. \n\nIn addition, creepy fetishists pop up only slightly less often than shaming weirdos.  Some of the breastfeeding activists are over the top, too. So when a random person brings up the topic, a breastfeeding person is usually loaded for bear.", "Breastmilk can also carry certain illnesses from the mother. It's the primary reason why nursing someone else's baby is so often discouraged by modern health authorities; a baby nursing from someone other than mom could give them diseases. In certain cases (adoptive mothers, same-sex couples, or breastmilk banks with screening protocols), it can be safe, but in most other situations there can be serious risks.", "No need to be a dick, i think OP was big to post this, and I was fucking disgusted by the first post.\n\nYou need to learn how to allow someone to change if you are going to ridicule them, otherwise you are suddenly the asshole, asshole.", "I just meant people are weird about the thought of an adult drinking human milk vs cows milk. Like it is literally made for humans. \n\nAlthough I never could talk my husband into trying it when I pumped for 8 months."]}
