The thing is, his family lives in another country, so the last time we saw them in person was during our wedding. Now, me and my husband like vacations. Before we got married, we decided that we wanted to take a trip every other year. We have a vacation fund and everything. My husband has been feeling very homesick lately and feels like he is missing out since he has missed some family events. He told me he feels like we should go to his home country. I've already been there, and I don\u2019t want to go again. I feel like if we go again, it won\u2019t feel like a vacation, especially since we would probably be pressured to stay at his mom's house. His mom is a sweetheart, but their housing conditions just don\u2019t feel like a vacation to me, plus they don\u2019t live in the capital, so I don\u2019t feel like it would be too fun. My husband tried to reassure me and told me that with the money he sent, they had made adjustments to the house and that we could stay there for three days, then go to the capital and stay for the remaining two weeks and a half. But I am a really big fan of European architecture and really want to visit there.\n\n\n\nWe were going back and forth, and then my husband suggested that we take separate trips. He would stay with his family for 2 weeks, and I would vacation wherever I wanted to stay in Europe by myself. But the best part of vacationing is being in each other's company and doing fun stuff together. I got upset and told him that I don\u2019t want to travel by myself; we always talk about traveling, and it always includes us doing it together. He told me that he felt like I was not willing to compromise.\nI feel like he is trying to make me the bad guy here; I just want a vacation we will both enjoy.\n\n\nEdit- I think some of you misunderstood what I wrote. He want me to spend 3 day in his parents house then we would take a bus to Bangkok and stay in a hotel there since there nothing to do in their parents state.
