The thing is, his family lives in another country, so the last time we saw them in person was during our wedding. Now, me and my husband like vacations. Before we got married, we decided that we wanted to take a trip every other year. We have a vacation fund and everything. My husband has been feeling very homesick lately and feels like he is missing out since he has missed some family events. He told me he feels like we should go to his home country. I've already been there, and I don\u2019t want to go again. I feel like if we go again, it won\u2019t feel like a vacation, especially since we would probably be pressured to stay at his mom's house. His mom is a sweetheart, but their housing conditions just don\u2019t feel like a vacation to me, plus they don\u2019t live in the capital, so I don\u2019t feel like it would be too fun. My husband tried to reassure me and told me that with the money he sent, they had made adjustments to the house and that we could stay there for three days, then go to the capital and stay for the remaining two weeks and a half. But I am a really big fan of European architecture and really want to visit there.\n\n\n\nWe were going back and forth, and then my husband suggested that we take separate trips. He would stay with his family for 2 weeks, and I would vacation wherever I wanted to stay in Europe by myself. But the best part of vacationing is being in each other's company and doing fun stuff together. I got upset and told him that I don\u2019t want to travel by myself; we always talk about traveling, and it always includes us doing it together. He told me that he felt like I was not willing to compromise.\nI feel like he is trying to make me the bad guy here; I just want a vacation we will both enjoy.\n\n\nEdit- I think some of you misunderstood what I wrote. He want me to spend 3 day in his parents house then we would take a bus to Bangkok and stay in a hotel there since there nothing to do in their parents state.

It's understandable that she'll want to go somewhere new, but that doesn't mean that she gets to keep him from his family. And if they were there for the wedding, chances are they probably didn't go to the capital, which means that would still be somewhere new. Somewhere she hasn't been before. But once again, compromising on a couple days with his family and then two weeks of vacation time is just not enough for her cuz it's not in the exact spot she wants it, and she's not willing to compromise on anything.", "No OP said SHE wants to go somewhere new", "Seriously, if I had an excuse to go visit Thailand regularly I\u2019d be like oh, twist my arm let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve never been but everything I\u2019ve seen about it looks gorgeous and like a place you couldn\u2019t get enough of.", "I meant she should.  I should have made that clearer, since he was.  OP is being a snotty AH.", "This!!! I went to Siem Reap, Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai by myself within the same year, just touring different temples and they are hauntingly beautiful! So many things you can do in Thailand and in SE Asian, it\u2019s a tropical holiday destination to Asians!", "She doesn\u2019t even know what Europe is really like (ie that every country there is different and poverty exists here too)", "Yes! From reading OP\u2019s post, I felt some contempt for her husband\u2019s country, like Europe is somewhat superior to Thailand, and she\u2019s too sophisticated to go travel there. Well, I live in Europe and I would kill for a ticket to Thailand. My sister went there and it looks like paradise on earth!", "It is, but it's different. There's nothing wrong with wanting to see European architecture, especially if OP has never been. It's certainly not racist.", "Preferences are not nessasarily, or even usually, racist\n\nThey're a selfish ass.

SMH \n\nI thought when people started trying to claim enjoying or cooking food of other cultures was racist but now they can\u2019t enjoy architecture either? \n\nThere are many actually racist things to get upset about and try to be/voice a change. We don\u2019t need to make up silly ones, it just makes people less likely to listen when there is an actual race issue someone is trying to point out.

It\u2019s THREE days. Tough it out and then you can go to one of the more touristy parts of Thailand and get all of the amenities you\u2019d miss at his parents\u2019 home. You are the one that\u2019s unwilling to vacation on your own so you need to either suck it up or let that man go see his family by himself.", "Why don\u2019t you visit some place NEXT YEAR HE MISSES HIS FAMILY SISTER\n\nGirl f you", "What\u2019s he\u2019s trying to do now is \u201csetting that plan in stone\u201d", "You're a rubbish partner.

Sure he'll have a better time without you.", "So the thing he already suggested and you complained about?\n\nYTA, get over yourself and do two separate trips or pull your big girl pants on and go to his home country.", "Him missing his family takes priority over your vacation just for fun. Let him go on his own. It's not just a touristy vacation for him and that's all you're interested in", "Why did you marry this man?

There are so many things to do and see outside the city and tourist areas and the food I have been told is phenomenal-all over Thailand.

It's a tourist mecca. The food, the beaches, the history and the nightlife. The architecture will rival your golden European standards. Have you done any research or are you so beholden on everything western that your idea of travel is going only to English speaking countries? YTA. I don't understand why people marry interracially if they are not willing to get to know all aspects of their partner.", "I think she just means she wants variety and hasn\u2019t seen much European architecture whereas she has already seen Thai architecture. I don\u2019t read this as racist. I married and moved to another country to be with my husband, and he doesn\u2019t love that I always want to visit home.\n\nImagine not wanting your husband to visit his parents after 3 years because you want his company to tour Europe.

She isn\u2019t interested in making sacrifices, it makes her anxious.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is disagreeing with that.

As someone from the US, I get embarrassed by the tendency for American tourists to expect everything to cater to them. Do you also expect them to serve milk at every meal too? Because that\u2019s why my dad\u2019s family hated France, and I hate it every time they bring up how much they didn\u2019t enjoy their trip. \n\nSuck it up and do something nice for your poor husband.

You sound SO selfish.\nYour whole post is me, me, me, me, me.\n\n\nHave you ever put yourself in his shoes? He left his whole family for you. Left everything and everybody he knew. And you can't even postpone going to Europe for a year to make him happy?\n\n\nYou also say \"doing something that makes us both happy\" you don't care if he is happy, or you would understand that his want and need to see his family trumps your wanting to see European architecture.", "Start learning his language.  Why are you so unwilling to compromise?  You're also not supportive at all.  You're a terrible partner.", "So learn some Thai. Your husband can help and it would demonstrate your lov\u00e9 and commitment to him and his needs and family.

What are you - 15?", "Glad we\u2019re on the same page now, sorry for the misunderstanding", "It\u2019s worse than that. IMO if you marry someone with a different first language you should at the very least work to have a rudimentary understanding of it, If you care for them. Clearly she hasn\u2019t bothered to learn any Thai in the time they have been dating and married. That\u2019s insane.", "Indeed. Moreover, I spent three weeks in Southeast Asia in January, including Thailand, and many locals speak basic English. The Thai people we met were all exceedingly friendly and patient, so we had no trouble getting around by using a combination of English, body language, and simple Thai words. Their English was no worse than that of the average European from a non-English-speaking nation, which I say as one.\n\nEdit: OP, in case it\u2019s not obvious enough at this point, YTA. You should wholeheartedly support your husband\u2019s need to reunite with his family. Europe will be in the same place next year. Your husband\u2019s emotional well-being or relatives, however, might not. Homesickness is frightfully painful enough without an uncaring spouse."]}
