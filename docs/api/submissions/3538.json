I assumed she thought that initially because I am kind of young and I know most people don\u2019t have kids as early as I did, so I told her that actually I was his mother.\n\nShe sort of frowned, looked between my baby and then me before saying \u201cbut he\u2019s\u2026Asian.\u201d\nShe said the word \u201cAsian\u201d in a really weird tone?

Can\u2019t wait to see how that develops as he gets older lol", "He had me fooled for an entire year, clearly he\u2019s very good at his job lol", "NTA but she wasn't racist", "I\u2019m gonna hold him up to a mirror after he wakes up from his nap so that I can inform him of his racial identity lol", "My SIL used to joke about it with her oldest all the time. She's mixed, looks Hispanic, and is 5' nothing. Her oldest is white and has been over 6ft since he was 14. She'd joke all the time that people thought she was his nanny because he looks nothing like her.", "People ask me if I\u2019m his nanny like all the time, so it doesn\u2019t make me as upset as it used to. Now it\u2019s mostly just irritating.", "Like why would this be okay? The least offensive way I can even think of if you're SO DESPERATE to be nosey is that weird, \"And who's this little love?\" and hope the other person says what their link to the kid is. That's at a proper push and I would only use it if I thought I was looking at a kidnapped kid, not for the sake of it \ud83d\ude02", "my wife and I are of different races. Our son looks 100% like her. The initial jokes were funny, but it wears off quickly. I have 4 family members who are adopted, not all of the same race.\n\nNo one should ever feel \"othered\". And calling someone out for othering is justified. They don't have to be my DNA to be my kids. They don't have to look like me to be mine. They don't have to be or do or look like anything they aren't. They are perfect exactly as they are. \n\nSure it could have been in a less AHish way, but shame on the person for assuming, then pushing.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, you would be surprised. It happens all the time.", "NTA. Lady was being nosy and rude prying into your personal business\n!", "NTA. She fucked around and found out!!", "NTA. My sister got comments and looks for her first two kids because they're olive/brown, and she's pale as hell and her husband is Asian. \n\nIt's actually because the kids take after my mom's side of the family, while my sister looks like my dad's side (lots of Spanish blood on that side apperantly). \n\nIf you look at my oldest niece, she's a mini me of my youngest sister, who's carbon copy of my mom. Her third kid finally did look like her, super pale and got my dad's blue eyes. Genetics are weird!", "Good for you! I'm a transracial adoptee and have experienced different flavors of this my whole life.", "\n\nThat woman was out of line and deserved to be publicly shamed.", "Uggg.  I hated that too.  I also got teen pregnancy crisis pamphlets when pregnant with my 1st.  I am 40 now and my eldest is 16, so you can math that.  I was also married at the time.    Everyone assumed he was some dirty old man in his 30s but he was 11 months older than me.", "I have an older brother who looks just like my dad while I don't... So many people assumed one of us was adopted or an affair baby. We laugh about it and simply say Im undercooked.", "He sounds completely adorable.", "You could tell them that all the babies in your family look like that until about 5.\n\nAll the kids in my family have brown eyes until 5 and then they change to green or blue.  Just the way DNA works for us.", "What a criminal energy...lol", "She assumed a WOC was the nanny. If OP were white, what are the chances she would have assumed adoption instead?", "When my daughter was around 3 one day while we were reading the Little House books and she looked up and said. \"All the people in that family are the same color!\" with a  \"how quaint!\" air about it. We informed her that it's okay if it happens that way...", "I totally understand that, it\u2019s all in what you\u2019re used to and the tone.  I\u2019m in the southern united states so those types questions are almost always absolutely smothered in racism.  \n\nEither way I LOVE your approach and I think it kept your son happy and engaged as well so bonus right? Keep going crazy jn the produce section \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\n\nI'm surprised you didn't get some white women crying because you were so mean!!", "he\u2019s the cutest! He got his dad\u2019s looks but he definitely got my sense of humor", "It\u2019s a reasonable assumption that if the kid doesn\u2019t look like the adult, that is probably not their kid. Nothing racist about it.", "Step-parent, adopted, friend's kid.... why go immediately to nanny? I spent a lot of time with m nieces and some friends kids when I was in my 20's and even though I looked pretty young for my age, no stranger assumed I was the nanny when I  took them out in public. Not once.", "Maybe, but when corrected, she responded with \"but he's... Asian\" in a weird tone. A non-racist or at least non-judgemental person would respond \"oh goodness, I'm so sorry! He must look just like his father!\" or something similar. She doubled down. That's weird.", "No, that is absolutely not a reasonable assumption and is pretty fucked up. Don't do that lmao. Do you assume that just because a kid have a different hair color than their mother that they aren't related?\n\nAre we really just regressing socially here? As a biracial person, I thought this type of shit was already deemed racist a long time ago.", "I agree nanny is not where I would have jumped to. But that doesn\u2019t automatically make it racist.", "Absolutely weird, but people are weird sometimes. But I think most people are genuinely good individuals who deserve the benefit of the doubt and a little grace. She could have said it in a weird tone because she was surprised her assumption was wrong and she forgot the brain-mouth filter.", "Huh? It\u2019s a reasonable assumption. If I have a black kid with me it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that I\u2019m not his biological dad since I\u2019m whiter than Casper.", "What would you call it? Assuming a WOC is a nanny?  Sounds racist to me.", "Again, if it was an innocent mistake, her reaction would probably have been different. I can't tell you 100% what was in her head, but I can tell you that what came out of her mouth sounded racist. If she wants to not be perceived as racist, she should work on her brain-mouth filter.\n\nAnd I say this as a woman with adhd who has spent YEARS working on her own brain-mouth filter. It's a real struggle. I've definitely said things that I regret, some of which appeared racist. Calling that out to me is never wrong and is even appreciated, so that I can work on it further. One example is using a phrase my mother used when we were kids (being wild and into everything like kids do) with my black coworker. That phrase was \"calm the monkeys\". I meant absolutely nothing by it beyond \"calm down\" in a friendly/joking way, but as soon as it came out of my mouth, the look in her face told me I'd fucked up and it took less than a moment of thought to realize my mistake. She called me out on it. I apologized, explained where it came from just to get us on the same page, and learned from it. She and I ended up getting pretty close over the year or so we worked together. That was like 10 years ago and I still feel awful about it, but not because of any personal embarrassment I felt. It bothers me because I hurt my coworker/friend, and I really hate that.\n\nI'm not judging the woman for assuming the kid that didn't look like the woman wasn't her kid or even being surprised that he looked so different from her. But her reaction implies some patterns of thought that she should work on, both for herself and for other people she interacts with. She is still responsible for the things that come out of her mouth, even if she didn't mean them the way they were interpreted. This time, the kid was only 1 and never would have understood what she said, and the mother made a joke of it to keep everyone laughing. But what if he was 3 or 4? Eventually he'll be old enough to at least recognize that the little old lady thinks it's weird/bad that he looks different than his mother. It is worth a bit of embarrassment for the little old lady to prevent her potentially hurting the next mixed race kid she meets.", "It's not though. Learn some basic level biology about genes. Feel free to assume whatever you want but it is still pretty racist and extremely inappropriate to confront someone about.", "Just an incorrect assumption unless given some reason to believe it was racially based. If someone assumed I was a babysitter I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it other than they were incorrect. Just because the individual is a color other than white does not mean that everything that happens to them is racist.", "I\u2019m aware of edge cases like the original post, but most children take some characteristics from both parents.", "Sure. I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation why a complete stranger walks up to a WOC and starts asking all sorts of questions about her child, assumes the WOC is the nanny and then exclaims \"but he's Asian!\" Than have absolutely nothing to do w/ racism. \n\nSorry, but I'm not going to give a woman who feels the need to know what a WOC is doing with a baby that is not the same race as her the benefit of the doubt.", "I am well aware that is uncommon. That isn't the point though and I feel like people without biracial parents just don't fully get it so I will try to detail why it is racist:\n\nLook, I looked 85% like my dad and 15% like my mom. People pulled this shit all the time and it definitely hurt her a bit. The mere act of doubting that I was her child due to *racial* features that I did not possess or assuming that I couldn't be her child due again those same *racial* features while not malice is still racist.  Assuming something about someone or a group of people based on racial stereotypes is *racism at its core definition*.\n\nAsking an African/Asian/Hispanic American person what country they are from is the same thing. They may born in the US or adopted and have no recorded connection to a foreign country.\n\nYes, the lady in OP's story isn't automatically a bad person but she is still racist for making the assumption based on racial stereotypes and she is kind of an asshole for approaching OP in the first place.", "We should give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Don\u2019t assume malice where stupidity will suffice."]}
