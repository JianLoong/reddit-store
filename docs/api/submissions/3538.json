She was asking about Rue, how old he was, his name, things like that.\nThen she asked how long I\u2019d been nannying for his parents. I assumed she thought that initially because I am kind of young and I know most people don\u2019t have kids as early as I did, so I told her that actually I was his mother.\n\nShe sort of frowned, looked between my baby and then me before saying \u201cbut he\u2019s\u2026Asian.\u201d\nShe said the word \u201cAsian\u201d in a really weird tone?

I can't tell you 100% what was in her head, but I can tell you that what came out of her mouth sounded racist. If she wants to not be perceived as racist, she should work on her brain-mouth filter.\n\nAnd I say this as a woman with adhd who has spent YEARS working on her own brain-mouth filter. It's a real struggle. I've definitely said things that I regret, some of which appeared racist. Calling that out to me is never wrong and is even appreciated, so that I can work on it further. One example is using a phrase my mother used when we were kids (being wild and into everything like kids do) with my black coworker. That phrase was \"calm the monkeys\". I meant absolutely nothing by it beyond \"calm down\" in a friendly/joking way, but as soon as it came out of my mouth, the look in her face told me I'd fucked up and it took less than a moment of thought to realize my mistake. She called me out on it. I apologized, explained where it came from just to get us on the same page, and learned from it. She and I ended up getting pretty close over the year or so we worked together. That was like 10 years ago and I still feel awful about it, but not because of any personal embarrassment I felt. It bothers me because I hurt my coworker/friend, and I really hate that.\n\nI'm not judging the woman for assuming the kid that didn't look like the woman wasn't her kid or even being surprised that he looked so different from her. But her reaction implies some patterns of thought that she should work on, both for herself and for other people she interacts with. She is still responsible for the things that come out of her mouth, even if she didn't mean them the way they were interpreted. This time, the kid was only 1 and never would have understood what she said, and the mother made a joke of it to keep everyone laughing. But what if he was 3 or 4? Eventually he'll be old enough to at least recognize that the little old lady thinks it's weird/bad that he looks different than his mother. It is worth a bit of embarrassment for the little old lady to prevent her potentially hurting the next mixed race kid she meets.", "It's not though. Learn some basic level biology about genes. Feel free to assume whatever you want but it is still pretty racist and extremely inappropriate to confront someone about.", "Just an incorrect assumption unless given some reason to believe it was racially based.

That isn't the point though and I feel like people without biracial parents just don't fully get it so I will try to detail why it is racist:\n\nLook, I looked 85% like my dad and 15% like my mom. People pulled this shit all the time and it definitely hurt her a bit. The mere act of doubting that I was her child due to *racial* features that I did not possess or assuming that I couldn't be her child due again those same *racial* features while not malice is still racist.

I feel for OP, people need to mind their business. Especially I see really weird questions to POC on here (like the one today about them washing their hair, wtf). They might not mean for their innocent questions to come off maliciously but that doesn't actually make it better for the recipient of those questions.", "Why would she assume the kid would lie about that? Or your dad, for that matter?", "Good cat!", "Still want to die from embarrassment remembering how my now-late MIL asked in almost a shout if a neighbor had adopted her two daughters as we waved at them across the street.", "She didn't know what to do because it was so unexpected.", "Walkie-talkies \ud83e\udd23", "My old house mate used to get people asking to speak to her parents, it was hilarious, she would do malicious compliance and start talking about the logistics of whether she should give out her parents info and what time it was in their State.", "I was a nanny in college and worked for a white family (I\u2019m white). I was 20 and looked 16 and the oldest was 9. People called her my daughter ALL THE TIME even though we looked nothing alike other than being white. Having an accent may prompt this too, but it\u2019s far more likely to happen to people who aren\u2019t white. Just to be fair. \n\nNTA OP. That shit was racist as hell. It\u2019s 2022 and people need to stop feeling within their rights to comment on other people\u2019s race.", "Yeah, I've had it happen to me, too, while they were in the process of hitting on my then husband. \"Oh, you must be the nanny.\" Blond haired blue eyed baby looked like his father, but I have brown eyes and reddish brown hair. Nope, not the nanny. \"Oh....so you're his aunt?\"", "Agreed!  My children look ALOT like me and I was constantly asked if I was babysitting\u2026.even a Dr asked me what relationship I was to my 14 year old son\u2026all because I am short, so people equate that with young I guess?!?!", "Dark-haired, grey-eyed woman here with a dark-haired, hazel-eyed daughter and a sandy-blonde, green-eyed son. I speak Spanish to them and when they were little, quickly learned to wear clothing I did not mind getting ruined.\n\nWhere we lived for a few years, the moms were mostly bottle blondes who dressed up. More than one person presumed I was the nanny.", "My mom did because as a kid I was blue-eyed, blonde, and simultaneously looked like I was, according to people, Chinese. So she was constantly getting 'YOU'RE the mother?' and 'where'd you adopt the blond Chinese kid?'. (I was not adopted.)", "No idea for my brother, except that in family pictures with dad, the 2 older boys, my mom (2nd wife, after first wife died), me (from her first marriage), and my younger brother (theirs together), we looked like we could be one nuclear family, all blood related.\n\nHe did grow up to lie a LOT, though, so maybe she'd caught him in other lies.\n\nDad, though, liked stupid little jokes. Like he'd be parking the car, and someone would ask mom where he was. Dad always wanted her to say \"we're separated right now\" just for the reaction, and would get annoyed that she wouldn't.\n\nOne time, years later, she was hurt in a car crash on the way to work. Dad called her office to say she wouldn't be in. Was getting truly upset that mom's coworker didn't believe him and assumed mom was just running late.", "That is funny.\n\nDid you tell your parents?\n\nHow old were you at the time? Still a teen?\n\nI'm adopted too and people can have some dumb assumptions sometimes.", "That is so gross. I had a coworker who was half Vietnamese and half white and they got this assumption when she went car shopping with her white Dad.", "I get that. \n\nSorry that it happened. People can suck.", "I'm half white, quarter Mexican, quarter native American. ended up with fairly almond shaped eyes that make people STRUGGLE to place an ethnicity every time i dye my hair black", "I was maybe 19? It was just absurd because they worked with BOTH my parents everyday. I did tell my parents, they didn't think it was as funny as I did. To be fair I wouldn't think it was funny to work with morons either. \ud83d\ude05"]}
