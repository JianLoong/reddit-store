She was asking about Rue, how old he was, his name, things like that.\nThen she asked how long I\u2019d been nannying for his parents. I assumed she thought that initially because I am kind of young and I know most people don\u2019t have kids as early as I did, so I told her that actually I was his mother.\n\nShe sort of frowned, looked between my baby and then me before saying \u201cbut he\u2019s\u2026Asian.\u201d\nShe said the word \u201cAsian\u201d in a really weird tone?

He giggled, which made me laugh, and the lady looked bright red and very annoyed because people were looking at us.\n\nShe told me that she was just surprised because he doesn\u2019t look anything like me, and I replied that I was surprised too obviously because today is the first day I ever took in any of his ethnic features. \n\nThen she said that I could have just answered the question she was obviously asking instead of making a public scene. She walked off still looking pissed, but I just finished getting what we needed and then left.\n\nI was telling my mom about it because she called when I got back to the house, and she also thinks I should have just informed the woman that my son\u2019s father is Asian instead of acting like a fool in the middle of the produce section.\n\nMaybe it was a bit of a jerk move to do it the way I did? But I mean if I tell you the kid is mine and you think the kid doesn\u2019t look like me, wouldn\u2019t the next best conclusion be that they look like their other parent?\n\nI just want outside opinions on if I was being an AH about this.", "created_utc": 1669756795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z86jmz/aita_for_acting_like_i_didnt_know_my_son_was_asian/", "score": 8504, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds racist to me.", "Again, if it was an innocent mistake, her reaction would probably have been different. I can't tell you 100% what was in her head, but I can tell you that what came out of her mouth sounded racist. If she wants to not be perceived as racist, she should work on her brain-mouth filter.\n\nAnd I say this as a woman with adhd who has spent YEARS working on her own brain-mouth filter. It's a real struggle. I've definitely said things that I regret, some of which appeared racist. Calling that out to me is never wrong and is even appreciated, so that I can work on it further. One example is using a phrase my mother used when we were kids (being wild and into everything like kids do) with my black coworker. That phrase was \"calm the monkeys\". I meant absolutely nothing by it beyond \"calm down\" in a friendly/joking way, but as soon as it came out of my mouth, the look in her face told me I'd fucked up and it took less than a moment of thought to realize my mistake. She called me out on it. I apologized, explained where it came from just to get us on the same page, and learned from it. She and I ended up getting pretty close over the year or so we worked together. That was like 10 years ago and I still feel awful about it, but not because of any personal embarrassment I felt. It bothers me because I hurt my coworker/friend, and I really hate that.\n\nI'm not judging the woman for assuming the kid that didn't look like the woman wasn't her kid or even being surprised that he looked so different from her. But her reaction implies some patterns of thought that she should work on, both for herself and for other people she interacts with. She is still responsible for the things that come out of her mouth, even if she didn't mean them the way they were interpreted. This time, the kid was only 1 and never would have understood what she said, and the mother made a joke of it to keep everyone laughing. But what if he was 3 or 4? Eventually he'll be old enough to at least recognize that the little old lady thinks it's weird/bad that he looks different than his mother. It is worth a bit of embarrassment for the little old lady to prevent her potentially hurting the next mixed race kid she meets.", "It's not though. Learn some basic level biology about genes. Feel free to assume whatever you want but it is still pretty racist and extremely inappropriate to confront someone about.", "Just an incorrect assumption unless given some reason to believe it was racially based.

I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation why a complete stranger walks up to a WOC and starts asking all sorts of questions about her child, assumes the WOC is the nanny and then exclaims \"but he's Asian!\" Than have absolutely nothing to do w/ racism. \n\nSorry, but I'm not going to give a woman who feels the need to know what a WOC is doing with a baby that is not the same race as her the benefit of the doubt.", "I am well aware that is uncommon. That isn't the point though and I feel like people without biracial parents just don't fully get it so I will try to detail why it is racist:\n\nLook, I looked 85% like my dad and 15% like my mom. People pulled this shit all the time and it definitely hurt her a bit. The mere act of doubting that I was her child due to *racial* features that I did not possess or assuming that I couldn't be her child due again those same *racial* features while not malice is still racist.

A question is to find out an unknown. Don't ask unless you're ready to deal with whatever the answer may be.
