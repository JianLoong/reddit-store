If you \\*are\\* willing to lose your job for that reason, then you still don't have to tell them that unless it's absolutely necessary. \n\nBy #2 I mean that you can still ask them for permission for the time off as if it's their choice, and if they say yes, then they will never have to know that you would have quit if it came down to it.\n\nIt is actually more professional to defer to your boss about whether you can have time off. It's not technically the boss's decision whether you help your sister or not because you're not a prisoner or anything, but it is the boss's decision whether to \\*approve\\* the time off. So give them some respect and at least pretend that they have control.\n\nDoing it the way you did makes them a lot more willing to fire you, which you probably don't want.\n\nSoft YTA.", "NTA\u2026 you could either call in sick and take leave really unexpectedly.. or you could do what you did.. give them a heads up and organise colleagues to cover you.

Otherwise, companies could be randomly put out of commission by too many people taking off the same day with no coordination.\n\nIf OP is willing to lose her job, then I agree that in reality her work has no choice about whether she helps her sister. But again, it's not just an illusion that workplaces have some power over who takes off when, and it hurts OP's standing at work to unnecessarily throw it in their faces that she's taking that day off no matter what.\n\nIt is truly a matter of respect.
