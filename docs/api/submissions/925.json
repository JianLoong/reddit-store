I am talking about the US, and I'm basing my comment on my particular training. I read through the policy on the EEOC website and it does not include general abusive behavior. When I was in HR I worked for a school district that was extremely serious about harassment in the workplace, and they included generally abusive behavior in their policies on workplace hostility. I'm actually kind of shocked that it isn't EEOC policy, tbh. I went through so much training and it was always included.\n\nEta- if my workplace included it in their company specific policies I would imagine that some others also do. There may be no federal grounds for lawsuit, but there may still be workplace consequences."]}
