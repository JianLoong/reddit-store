She later found out that she was pregnant and that he was in a relationship with two step children and a child of their own. Elle kept the baby and James has been involved the whole time. When he told his partner (32F, i\u2019ll call her Clare) she decided to stay in the relationship and encouraged a blended family set up for the children. Elle and I both found this weird but in the beginning she felt very guilty and just went along with things to keep the peace. For a while Elle and Clare actually became quite good friends, Elle and James co-parented really well and all the children saw each other a lot. The relationship did eventually break down when Clare became quite controlling and interfered a lot with Elle and James parenting and trying to find their own way of doing things and Elle decided to keep contact to a minimum and arrangements were made for James to have their son every other weekend. I thought this was a good idea as it really was odd to me that they all got on in the first place and the controlling behaviour really was taking a toll on Elle. \n\nThis is where I think Elle is now the asshole. \n\nJames and Clare\u2019s relationship really started to break down and so did Clare and Elles. Eventually James started seeing their son at Elles house. James and Clare are still in a relationship and living together. Clare asked him to leave, then they patched things up and now he says he\u2019s leaving but hasn\u2019t for the last 18 months. For that entire time James and Elle have had a relationship seemingly behind Clare\u2019s back. Elle has told me that she\u2019s sure Clare knows and that they only live together still to finalise finances and for the children. I think she\u2019s deluded and that James is telling her a web of lies to have his cake and eat it but she cannot be told. Elle and James act like a couple, they tell each other they love each other, James stays overnight at Elles house and they do things as a family. Elle is completely infatuated. But James is still in a relationship. \n\nElle did recently tell James he either needed to leave Clare or leave her but he pulled the wool over her eyes and the situation hasn\u2019t changed at all, so I told her that she is weak and that she is the asshole for continuing this relationship.

I think, in this situation, you were right to speak up.", "She is an AH.  He is an AH.  \n\nYou are not the AH.  So long as you were not to harsh with her.  I would follow up with either a message or a call saying \u201chow are you doing\u201d\n\nMake the next contact all about her.  Tell her that you are there for her.

Also I don\u2019t think its odd that Clare wanted everyone involved - I feel like this was her way of trying to keep her relationship together and keep everyone happy while being honest and open with the kids. Basically trying to clean up James mess. What IS odd though is Elle deciding to have a baby with a one night stand who is in another relationship with three kids. James is definitely the asshole for cheating but Elle needs to wake the fuck up??? The truth upset her because it goes against her delusional reality - she receded because interacting with you means facing her delusions.", "James and Elle are definitely AHs, whether you are or not depends on exactly how you gave her your opinion. \n\nINFO: How did you broach the subject and what did you say to her? Did you use the word weak?", "ESH.\n\nAll three of the adults involved in this mess of a co-parenting scheme suck because their children are the ones paying for their terrible choices. James for being the major AH and cheating on Claire 3 years ago and now again, and both Claire and Elle for staying with him instead of kicking him to the curb.\n\nYou might be the AH for giving Elle unsolicited advice, but that depends on whether she has just vented to you endlessly and you rightfully got tired of her shenanigans.", "NTA. I worry about that child.", "Nta", "This is going to be a very polarizing question but I'll say *NTA* Only bc I would have done the exact same thing, I'm a firm Darwinist. It is weakness and since she keeps making it your problem, you have a right to respond. If she doesn't appreciate your honesty, then she doesn't deserve it.", "Maybe a bit YTA? James sounds pretty manipulative, so blaming her maybe isn't great. Hard to tell though. What I think we can all agree on is that James is the true AH in every sense", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn't mean you're wrong, but you're blaming your friend for James' behavior.  He cheated the first time.  He's continuing to cheat.  Unfortunately, Elle believes his lies.
