Not because you didn't want to, you just literally can't.  You told her you would try but possibly still not be able to make it work. I think \"try\" is a key word here. If you knew you could afford it by any means you wouldn't have to tell her you'd \"try\".  If anything she should be proud that you are mindful of your financial position, and what is or is not an appropriate expense. Your mom is definitely in the wrong for making you stress about this. Glad some of your family is on your side about it, and hopefully those who aren't will come around. I hope at least they wanted you to take a vacation and have a good time, and weren't just pissy because you didn't want to dig yourself deeper into a financial hole and add that weight to your shoulders.\n\nA story you reminded me of, I too am paycheck to paycheck. Recently I was talking with somebody about their upcoming Europe vacation and they were shocked i'd never been/had no definite plans to go. Not wanting to discuss my less than desirable financial position with a near stranger, I just said, \"maybe some day!\" He still spent the next 10 minutes saying \"you should just go! You just have to do it!\" It drives me crazy when people pull the \"life's too short\" card. Like, look at my overdrawn bank account and my bills and tell me again to just drop everything and miss 2 weeks of pay to go to Europe because you think I just should lol.  It's a fine mentality to have but not to push on other people. Bottom line, sometimes you just CAN'T do X, Y, or Z. It isn't a matter of being too reserved a person to get the most out of life or not *wanting* to do certain things. But there is such a thing as living within your means.\n\nAnyway, good on you for standing your ground. Vacation should be fun and relaxing, not stressful!", "NTA!!

You're a young adult with a life away from Mommy, so she needs to accept that (she's long overdue)", "NTA -- Your mother is advocating some seriously irresponsible financial behavior. Wild suggestion.", "NTA Taking a loan to go on a vacation you can't afford would be a bad financial move.", "I can\u2019t believe your mom would put you in that position. I am sorry you are put in this position.", "NTA.  Moms giving bad advice", "NTA: your mom is though.", "Wow, and I thought I had it bad. You are NTA. Do NOT let them financially ruin you, bc if you go and that trip and it turns out to be a bad idea like you already know it to be, you clearly are going to be left out on the curb. Good luck OP.", "Nta", "This cannot be real lol worst financial advice ever", "Mom and her cronies want you there so badly, they can pay for the trip for you.  Never go into debt for a 'want', especially not something that has no return value for you.  Save your credit for a home, car, education, moving for a new job.  NTA", "NTA. Your mom is mad at you for not making bad financial decisions. Another thing is she just TOLD you they were going on a trip. Even thought your an adult they didn't consult you at all. They just told you they are going and told you to spend your money to go. Why do they even want you to go? You're busy with school. Sometimes in life your just busy.", "NTA. Ugh I too have a mom who has a die hard boner for vacations. My exs mom was the same \nIt\u2019s always vacation with the family over literally everything. Yeah barf. Sorry you have to be around a narcissist!!!", "NTA. Your mother is being entirely irrational and should instead be proud of you for making hard but responsible decisions. Tell your mom that she taught you better than to bury yourself in frivolous debt.", "Nta, this is how people get into financial trouble. You do not take a loan out to go on vacation. I did not get my first real vacation until I was 25, and that was my honeymoon. It was another 6 years before the next and my inlaws paid for it. If you can't afford it, don't go.", "NTA. Your mother's request is ludicrous, completely insane, and extremely stupid. Do not ever take financial advice from this woman, and make sure she doesn't have access to any of your personal information/documents anymore.", "I think my mum gives better advice than yours.

If I have to get a loan I'll get it in advance through my credit union, though.  I did that the last time (years ago) when I bought a new car. The line that they use about \"what do you expect your payment to be\" gets no rise from me and that leaves them a little befuddled.  It also drove them crazy when I just pulled out a book to read when they \"had to go talk to their manager\".  I had all day, and a very good book.  I also had a decent car for a trade in which I never intended to use that way so they had no leverage there either.  I sold it to my BIL for a very reasonable price that made us both happy.  \n\nAfter that, I bought my next car (this one) at CarMax where the price is listed and that's that.", "It really is nice.  It's like looking down from above seeing exactly where your car is in relation to everything around including the lines marking the parking space.

Also, don't ever go into debt on someone else's say-so. Welcome to adulthood.

It may be your mom but your mom is wrong, and you\u2019re the one who would pay the price (literally). You just say what you did and leave it at \u201cI hope I can join you next time.

Your mother is definitely the AH. Definitely don't do that.", "NTA. Having good financial sense and avoiding debt is so important at your age.

My family went on a trip back to our home province for a wedding when my 19 year old daughter was 4 months into her new job. She was very clear that she was not willing to ask for time off to cross the country so soon after being hired so she stayed behind. It worked out great because she was able to take care of the pets and everyone we saw during the visit who asked we told them the exact truth, she just got a job and didn\u2019t have any vacation time saved up and didn\u2019t want to give a bad impression to her employer. Literally everyone understood and many applauded her work ethic.\n\nYou\u2019re making the best choice for yourself to not take on more debt right now. Don\u2019t let your family pressure you.", "NTA, it's insane to me that you had to ask.", "Wow NTA and your mom sucks! When I was in college my mom would always help me pay for things like this when she invited me - you\u2019re barely an adult and life is expensive!", "NTA\n\nYour mother is delusional.", "As a mother I can tell you that if I wanted my son to come on a trip\u2026\u2026I\u2019d pay for him ! NTA. I can\u2019t even begin to fathom asking my son to take out a loan for a vacation! Stay firm you do not have to go. You will end up in financial difficulty, next she will ask you to take a loan out to pay for her portion of the trip.", "With that kind of crazy advice from the mom, I doubt she has the money.", "Mom can take out a loan and pay for it! NTA. You're being realistic, and she doesn't care if you struggle. She wants you there at her demand.", "NTA. If she wants you to go, she can subsidize it"]}
