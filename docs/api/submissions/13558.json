It's totally wild to suggest someone take out a loan for a holiday they can't afford, let alone a college student. \n\nIf she wants you there so much, why doesn't she pay for you? If she can't afford it, she could always get a bank loan .", "NTA. You\u2019re being responsible with your finances. If your mom wants you to go so badly she can pay for you. Otherwise, she needs to back off.", "NTA and I can't believe your mom suggested a loan. No. Don't do that. Kudos for having the financial intelligence and plain good sense not to break your budget over a vacation.", "NTA. You can't afford to go with the money you have. Taking out a loan would make your financial situation even worse. Besides, I doubt any bank would loan you money for a vacation. And why would your mom want you to go into debt for a basically frivolous expense? Don't go if you can't afford it.", "NTA your mom can pay for you if she wants you to go so bad. Part of being an adult is making good financial decisions.", "NTA. You've got a lot more sense than she has.", "Nta, mommy should pay for it . Going into dept for a vacation it\u2019s not logical IMO", "NTA. If you can\u2019t afford it don\u2019t go. Taking a loan is a ludicrous suggestion.", "NTA. \n\nIf she wants you there so bad, tell her to pay for it. \n\nNot worth putting yourself into financial hardship.", "NTA, never take out a loan for a holiday! Your mum can pay for you or loan you the money if she's that determined to have you there.", "NTA. Your mom probably takes this personally because she feels like you don't want to spend time with her even though you are just responsible with the little money you have.", "NTA\n\nif she wants you there so badly, she can help pay. You\u2019re just being responsible with your money.", " NTA Take out a bank loan just for a vacation? Is your Mom nuts? If you can't afford the vacation how does she think you can afford a loan?

Shoot, I'd be delighted that my child was making good decisions.  NTA.", "Your mom is delusional. I'm surprised she has handled her money well enough to afford a vacation if her advice to a college student is \"take a bank loan\" ... for a vacation. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA", "Your MOTHER told you to take a loan to go on vacation with her?

I've had a similar situation where my mother in law wanted me and my husband to take weeks off for a family vacation we couldn't afford since we had no vacation time. Do what you can afford", "NTA. A vacation is a want, not a need. Never take out loans for wants.", "NTA. \"I\u2019m currently in college living almost paycheck-paycheck.\" That says it all. You don't need more debt.", "A bank loan. For a vacation. Gotta be kidding me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Do these people think affording things is a choice or something?  I don't get it...", "NTA your mom is insane", "NTA. It's wonderful that you ended up being such a responsible person with so awful of a mother, don't screw it up now.", "NTA it's 100% financially immature to take out a personal loan to fund a vacation. No one should go into debt to go on a family vacation; you either can afford it or you can't (using CC for rewards/points is different as long as you have the $$ to pay it off immediately & don't let interest accrue).", "Nta. Tell her if she wants you to go. Then she can pay for it.", "NTA your mom is wrong. Don't take a loan for vacation. If your mom wants you to go, she can pay", "Then tell mom to pay for it. NTA", "NTA and tell the family members who agree with your mum, to pay for your ticket. You should never get into loan or credit card debt for a luxury like a holiday.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is obviously not in s position to be making financial requests. If she can't afford to pay for you she should not be giving financial advice, ie taking out a loan, which is entirely absurd.", "NTA at all. You're a grown adult who can make their own decisions and if your decision is not to go into debt to finance a family holiday that you've been \"told\" you have to go on, then your mother will have to accept it. Don't give her the opportunity to bully you into it. Tell her that you are absolutely not going to strain your already meagre finances to pay for a family holiday and if she so badly wants you to go, then she can pay for you herself. I suspect this will stop the nagging to an extent. \n\nThe fact also remains that she shouldn't be telling you you have to go regardless. It's a decision for you to make, not her.  Stay strong and put your foot down.", "NTA. Weird that you're more financially responsible than your parent. If she wants you to come so bad why doesn't she take out the loan?", "NTA  \nIf you went  you would be missing work & therefore pay so unless she is going to pay for the trip & give you cash to cover your missed wages, I would just tell her it's not happening & don't ask again.", "\"Hi Mom and random family members, I am stoked to hear that you think I should go on vacation even though I can't afford it.

Taking a bank loan for a holiday would be the start of a lifetime of bad decisions", "NTA.  you're mom should flip the bill for it if it's that important to her.  And take out a loan??!! Is she insane.  I'm guessing she isn't aware that interest rates are the highest they've been in a little over a generation.  Wtf is wrong with her?  While it would be great to take a break from all things stressful and go on a vacation it doesn't mean it's doable.  The financial strain in our current economy is just too great for some.

It's not your fault", "NTA.\n\nStand up on your own two feet and say NO!\n\nA bank loan, just to appease your mother's rage?\n\nWhat are you, her property?", "Your mom is nuts for telling you to get a loan.

Better yet, get those family members who to provide the funds.", "Never, ever, ever take out a loan for a vacation unless it is truly a once in a lifetime experience that you can never come close to - like spending a week with your dying mother whom you are very close to and is dying much earlier than anyone would have anticipated.\n\nNta", "My mother constantly bugs me to go to her winter home in Saltsprings. Or to Hawaii with the extended family. Keep telling her no, cost too much, and  she keeps bugging me every year.", "NTA, but my dude, you're 24 years old.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGo read 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty' and enjoy the rest of your life.", "NTA never ever take out a loan for a vacation your mom is giving terrible financial advice", "NTA.  Taking a loan out for a vacation would be incredibly foolish of you.  If you can't afford it you can't afford it.", "If she wants you there so much why can't pay for your share?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sometimes the financial situation sucks, and as a person who financially struggled through college, I sympathize.  \n\n\nYou can ask the disapproving relatives if they'd advance you cash for the ticket(s) against future birthday and Xmas gifts.  \n\n\n(But writing now, as an older adult who has lost too many family members over the years, if I could go back and spend time with the relatives I'd move earth and sky to do it.)", "NTA.  Don't go on a vacation you can't afford and sure as hell don't borrow money to do it.", "Oh friend. Please, from this moment on through the rest of your life, know that you should NEVER take any financial advice from your mother or the family members who agree with her. They are giving you a gift right now by making it 100%, indisputably clear that their perspective is not in your best interests.\n\nYou would know better than me whether they are well meaning but just very ignorant when it comes to financial health, or whether there is an element of spite there, but whatever is motivating them is not your problem.\n\nYou are responsible for your life... and your financial health is going to be a HUGE part of it. Keep making good decisions for yourself, and learn to not engage with people who disagree and try to guilt-trip you.\n\nYou got this.", "What bloody mother tells their child to take out a loan for a holiday?!? NTA, no is enough you don\u2019t owe them debt.", "NTA what sort of mother asks her child to get into debt just to see them in the summer. The answer is no and I doubt other family members have heard all the facts. Never get into debt if you do not have to and never to appease other people. Your mother is being very selfish.", "NTA. If your mom so badly wants you to visit then she can pay for it. My mom and I have a deal. If she wants me to visit and I can't afford the ferry she pays for it and I pay for dinner when I finally get there. Maybe try something like this", "NTA please don't take financial advice from your mom. That is basically the worst advice of all time.", "NTA. It's absolutely fiscally irresponsible to get a bank loan for a vacation. And even if the bank would approve a loan, interest rates are climbing, so that particular vacation would continue to cost money, leaving you less able to save up for the next one. \n\nStick to your guns!", "Going into dept for a vacation it\u2019s not logical IMO", "Exactly. If she wants to have control over the details of the vacation (dictating the dates, destination, accommodations, etc) and demand her kids attendance then she can pay. If she's going to treat her adult (but still in school and financially struggling) kids as independent adults then she has to either accept when they don't have the funds to join or let them help plan a vacation they can afford to attend.", "Your mum can pay for you or loan you the money if she's that determined to have you there."]}
