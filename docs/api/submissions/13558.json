It's totally wild to suggest someone take out a loan for a holiday they can't afford, let alone a college student. \n\nIf she wants you there so much, why doesn't she pay for you?

Otherwise, she needs to back off.", "NTA and I can't believe your mom suggested a loan. No. Don't do that. Kudos for having the financial intelligence and plain good sense not to break your budget over a vacation.", "NTA. You can't afford to go with the money you have. Taking out a loan would make your financial situation even worse. Besides, I doubt any bank would loan you money for a vacation.
