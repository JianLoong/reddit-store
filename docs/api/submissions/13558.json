Not because you didn't want to, you just literally can't.  You told her you would try but possibly still not be able to make it work. I think \"try\" is a key word here. If you knew you could afford it by any means you wouldn't have to tell her you'd \"try\".  If anything she should be proud that you are mindful of your financial position, and what is or is not an appropriate expense. Your mom is definitely in the wrong for making you stress about this. Glad some of your family is on your side about it, and hopefully those who aren't will come around. I hope at least they wanted you to take a vacation and have a good time, and weren't just pissy because you didn't want to dig yourself deeper into a financial hole and add that weight to your shoulders.\n\nA story you reminded me of, I too am paycheck to paycheck. Recently I was talking with somebody about their upcoming Europe vacation and they were shocked i'd never been/had no definite plans to go. Not wanting to discuss my less than desirable financial position with a near stranger, I just said, \"maybe some day!\" He still spent the next 10 minutes saying \"you should just go! You just have to do it!\" It drives me crazy when people pull the \"life's too short\" card. Like, look at my overdrawn bank account and my bills and tell me again to just drop everything and miss 2 weeks of pay to go to Europe because you think I just should lol.  It's a fine mentality to have but not to push on other people. Bottom line, sometimes you just CAN'T do X, Y, or Z. It isn't a matter of being too reserved a person to get the most out of life or not *wanting* to do certain things.

You don't have to do anything just because other people are (even family) and especially if doing so will make you struggle a lot longer than the time of the trip.
