Right off the bat he was complaining about being tired, and he kept walking away from the front desk for 1-1.5 hours at a time, I honestly have no idea where he went. I trained him on my whole night and showed him everything I do and told him what times I do everything at, but he seemed like he couldn't care less and just rushed through everything. He told me he will have been up 36 hours by the time our shift ended, and that he was going to go home and pass out and sleep a bunch. \n\nWell Saturday night when we started, he told me he decided to stay awake all day and play with his motorcycle and stuff, and only slept 3 hours. Now I can empathize with sleep problems, and I totally understand how hard it is to switch to working nights when you're used to being up all day. I get that. But within 15 minutes of our shift starting he asked me what he \"needed to do for me for him to be able to go take an hour and a half long nap\".... He also didn't show any initiative in learning the job again tonight, didn't ask any questions or what he should do or when, etc. Around 3:30 am I went to the bathroom and did a quick walk through of the hotel, and when I came back he was asleep behind the front desk. I walked around back, not trying to be quiet, and sat there behind him for over 5 minutes, then went and did some cleaning for another 5 minutes before he finally woke up. When he did wake up he was mad I didn't wake him up. I told him I'm here to train him not babysit him, and if he can't be responsible enough to manage his sleep better or not fall asleep at work, that wasn't my problem. Him learning the job is my job. I know I am here to help him learn the job, but I think 26 is plenty old enough to know better than to stay awake that much when you know you have to work overnight.

So if they find out, he may get in trouble for falling asleep.

You should also have filed a report or spoken to your manager about the situation.  If I owned the hotel I would be upset that you allowed the front desk to be without an attendant.  You don\u2019t owe it to the employee to wake them but you do owe it to your employer. IMO.  The co-worker needs to get his act together or he will end up fired.  If it happens again wake him up and file a report.", "I hope you take some of what I have wrote an apply it to your situation. I\u2019m giving you good advice.

I worked at a hotel where the night auditor was regularly taking naps. It went unnoticed because as you said no one's going to check the cameras all the time, except one night a guest came down because there was a problem in their room and found the night auditor asleep. You can bet that management checked the cameras then and it wound up a world of trouble for her. \n\nIt's a hotel. There are guests. Someone is going to find him asleep at some point and he's going to get into trouble. Not to mention that if his coworker doesn't report it and it's found out that they knew, they could also be getting into trouble.", "Well I don't mind taking some blame, I just don't think I'm an asshole for it.

This is not challenging... report this information to your supervisor or HR.", "I am reporting it.......... nowhere in my post did I say I wasn't going to report it.", "You asked if you were an ah for not waking him up... the correct answer is yes. As a manager my question to you would be where were you & did you wake him up because you can\u2019t train a person who is sleeping. Then I would deal with the guy. Why the guy fell asleep is no one concern.

The duty is to ensure continued income for the employer so that as an employee OP can continue to be paid.  His job description was literally training said sleeper to man the front desk as well as run the front desk.  Refer to my previous comment as your reply was a reply to my reply to OPs reply to my initial judgement.  In my original judgement I clearly state that the other employee needs to get his shit together and Should be reported to management.  Failure of one employee to do their job doesn\u2019t give way for the rest of the operation just become a shit show.  \u201cThat\u2019s not my job\u201d is an excuse to that is only allowable when it is outside the scope of your normal work or workload when clearly that was not the case here:", "I may be wrong so oops if I am.

When training new employees it helps to see how they approach the job seeing as you aren't there when they are working. Everyone thinks cctv is there for protection but most of time it's used for spying on staff. You don't need to watch all of it. Mostly you'll just breeze through at double speed just to see behaviour like falling asleep or theft for example.", "Literally yes wtf\n\nAs someone who has ACTUALLY worked these jobs, you better believe they do audits", "Uh huh.", "YTA for not reporting him the first day.", "The front desk was manned, I was there while he was sleeping. Also, you literally cannot be at the front desk at ALL times, that's not how night audit works. I shouldn't have to train someone to not sleep on the job, that should be a very obvious given. You seem to think I wouldn't have stepped in if something were to happen or someone came up to the desk, that's not the case at all; just bc I don't think it's my responsibility to keep someone awake when they purposely chose not to get sleep knowing they had to work overnight again doesn't mean I'm not going to continue to do my actual job of running the hotel. Telling someone to stay awake at work is very much outside the normal workload. How often do you have to wake coworkers up? Because I've never had to in the last 17 years I've been working.", "As I\u2019ve stated more than once in multiple comments the other employee needs to get his shit together and should be reported to management.  At no time did I state your job description is to babysit dumbasses.  For the fourth time - the YTA comes from duty to the employer.  You think it\u2019s okay for the little AH to get paid to sleep??  I\u2019d have woken his ass up just to piss him off and still reported his ass for sleeping.  I work in an office and I\u2019ve had to wake people up.  My husband works at a dealership and has had to wake people up on more than one occasion. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve never had to deal with it before and hope you never do again.  Since you seem to be so confused about it, ask your manager what company policy is and use that as your guideline.", "NTA Did this really need to be an AITA? Come on."]}
