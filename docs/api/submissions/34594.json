This was a long time coming. Annabelle has been miserable at home for years and has talked to her mom countless times and had me, my mom and my brother talk to her mom on her behalf before. Nothing changed until Annabelle was finally done.\n\nThis all started when Annabelle was 4. My sister Natasha (47) met her husband and they moved in together with his then 5 year old daughter, Jasmine. Annabelle instantly adored Jasmine which I know my sister hyped her up for them being sisters and stuff. But Jasmine from day one was very negative toward Annabelle. She would scream at Annabelle and call her names. It was normal kid acting out stuff that wasn't corrected from what we witnessed. Then over the years it just kept getting worse and it stayed a very negative relationship even after Annabelle stopped trying to be sisters or even friends with Jasmine. \n\nJasmine was with her dad way more than her mom. Her mom, like Annabelle's dad, was a bit of a deadbeat though at least she knew her mom where Annabelle has never met her dad. Whenever we would see them Jasmine would have no problem playing with other kids, even other kids in our family, but she would tell Annabelle she couldn't play or she would blame Annabelle for making her stop playing with others. My brother's kids would come and tell us what was going on and neither Natasha or her husband would say or do anything. My mom went over a few times to say it wasn't nice to exclude kids and Jasmine would say she hated Annabelle and wanted her to go away.\n\nThis all bled into school where Annabelle was bullied by Jasmine and some of her friends. Still nothing was done. Natasha dismissed everyone who mentioned it to her. She would even ask Annabelle if she really wanted her to be unhappy and single again or why couldn't she accept that some sisters won't always like you. She would ignore when Annabelle told her that Jasmine *never* liked her. We did our best to be supportive of Annabelle and we even tried to figure out if we could help things with her and Jasmine.\n\nIt came as no surprise to me when Annabelle told us her grandparents were fighting for custody. When they won it was surprising because I almost expected it to go in Natasha's favor since she's her mom. But the judge decided Annabelle was old enough to have a say and took everything into account. Natasha was furious with the decision and has been crying and raging ever since. Nobody has comforted her and we've pulled back now that we no longer need to go through her to see Annabelle. This might be why she showed up at my house the other night and wanted to talk and when I didn't let her in, she asked me why we're not there for her. I told her that I don't feel sorry for her at all and I said it was her fault this happened.\n\nNatasha called me a bitch and stormed away from my house. She sent me a text yesterday saying I should still be there for her.

While I'm not surprised and can't say I do actually feel bad for my sister after everything that has happened I wonder if I should have tried to be there for her anyway with the thought that maybe I could open her eyes and she could at least try to make things better with my niece.

What you said was harsh, but honest. Poor Annabelle, of course she wanted out of a house where her stepsister had bullied her for years for no reason and her mom didn\u2019t care. The absolute audacity of \u201cShe would even ask Annabelle if she really wanted her to be unhappy and single again\u201d! Charming emotional manipulation there. Didn\u2019t care if her kid was unhappy so long as she was married, I guess.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised the judge sided with Annabelle given the situation (and her age). Eleven years of misery is enough. Anyone with an ounce of empathy for your niece couldn\u2019t possibly \u201cbe there\u201d for your sister. She made this bed now she had to lie in it and realize she\u2019s a lousy mom.", "NTA - Natasha had no care or sympathy for her own daughter, why should she expect care and sympathy now that the daughter has finally broken free?   You can still support her by suggesting she get counseling so she can figure out how to repair the relationship in the future, but that's about as far as I'd go.", "NTA\n\nWell, I hope Natasha is forced to pay child support, too. I'm not sure why she's moaning. Now she can live up her husbands ass with no interference from your family or Annabelle.\n\nSure, Jasmine is chuffed, too.\nEveryone should be happy really /s\n\nBut in all seriousness, my older bio-sister was about half as bad as Jasmine and I've had longstanding issues, including resentment towards my parents and her for what I know was very abusive, manipulative, controlling behaviour.  So I also hope grandparents can get Annabelle some therapy..... \nI know I need some!", "NTA .. I couldn't sit there and sympathise after that.  She's  brought it on herself and Annabelle is coming to her most important time in her education she doesn't need Jasmine and the mean girls giving her a hard time.\n\nCan't help feeling angry that Jasmine won though.  She wanted Annabelle to go away... and she succeeded.", "Tell Natasha that she needs to accept that some sisters aren't going to like you.  THEN slam the door in her face. NTA", "NTA. Natasha allowed her own daughter to be abused in her own home, all because she wanted to share her bed. Her new husband meant more than Annabelle, and ignored repeated attempts to intervene on Annabelle's behalf because then she'd have to do something and she'd be held responsible. Her manipulation is appalling, \"do you want me to be alone\", absolutely reprehensible. \n\nAnnabelle has been failed by her mother, her school and she won't forget it. Natasha has now been shown to be the absolute failure of a parent that she is and she's upset. Though I'm curious which grandparents Annabelle has gone to now, as it seems implied to be the paternal side.\n\nRegardless her abuse victim has escaped, the world sees who she is, who would want to call that woman \"sister\" anymore.", "Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of Natasha's actions. \n\nI'd ask her why it's so important to her that Annabelle return. Is Jasmine perhaps now targeting Natasha? Or does Natasha simply not care for the idea that people could think she was ever wrong about something? Natasha clearly didn't give a damn about Annabelle, you'd think she'd be glad to be rid of her, now they can live in their happy family of three, and mommy can continue to put her own priorities ahead of anyone else. NTA", "*She would even ask Annabelle if she really wanted her to be unhappy and single again* \n\nThis is the crux of it. Your sister did nothing for years because she was too selfish to even consider rocking the boat because it might not benefit her.\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nYou have been there for he, but she didn't listen. She is trying to shift blame wherever she can. She sounds super immature for 47.", "NTA\n\n\nTell your sister the same thing she told Annabelle \u201cwhy can\u2019t she accept that some sisters won't always like you\u201d and that her own choices to ignore the needs of her child made sure that her family wouldn\u2019t back up her selfish AH choices and certainly won\u2019t comfort her when the consequences of her choices now hit her. \n\nYou can also add another quote from what your sister said to Annabelle \n\n\u201cwhy does she want to see Annabelle unhappy and alone\u201d", "NTA\n\nShe was never there for her kid, why should you be there for her.  \"We'Re FaMiLy\" isn't enough when that family is abusive or neglectful.", "NTA - Her daughter/your niece deserves to be in a loving home, I hope she's feeling safer and more secure now with her grandparents.", "NTA - I know (and actively helped so we\u2019re clear this isn\u2019t word of mouth) a family in a similar-ish situation. In this case, the daughter was being mistreated by her mom in ways that left no visible scars. No matter how much the family tried to explain to mom that she needed to get it together, she refused to listen. The same old \u201cyou\u2019re against my happiness\u201d bs. \n\nIn a wild turn of events, the court granted her grandparents custody. They had no right to ask for custody but the court deferred to the teenage daughter. Only then did mom show up depressed and confused, but there was STILL no reasoning with her. She wasn\u2019t receptive to the truth. All it did was cause her to lash out more, claim everyone was against her, called the cops on the grandparents and her daughter more than once, trespass on family\u2019s property to try to kidnap her daughter. \n\nEver since everyone stopped trying to care for mom too did her ability to reach her daughter become damn near impossible. So good on you. If there was no reasoning with your sister before, there\u2019s no reasoning with her now. No matter what, this will always be about her.", "NTA.  You tried which is what you could have done.  It wasn't your fault that Natasha threw her daughter in the trash through her inactions to force a happy family facade.  You are correct in saying that it was Natasha's fault.  Natasha was the adult and parent which she failed miserably at as you have written the post.", "NTA\nNatasha spent years ignoring the problem and making her daughter feel like a second thought.", "NTA. Natasha wants you to be there for her, but where was Natasha when Annabelle needed her? Your sister brought this on herself, to the detriment of her own daughter. Kudos to the grandparents!", "Tell your sister if she wanted a sister, she should\u2019ve taught her stepdaughter to be a better sister NTA", "Annabelle knew she wasn\u2019t wanted and she was old enough for a judge to listen to her. \n\nSucks for her mom that her mom is unhappy about the change of custody, but if mom had actually *done* something about Annabelle\u2019s unhappy relationship with her resentful \u201csister\u201d at some point over a course of *years*, it might not have come to this. NTA", "NTA. You were there for her, but she refused to listen to you or even acknowledge the issue you tried repeatedly to address. Now that she is facing the consequence of her own behavior, she simply wants a sympathetic ear and shoulder to cry on. That's a very narrow, self-serving definition of \"being there\".", "NTA - she was toxic and abusive to her own daughter, why should she get pity lol", "NTA, Natasha just needs to accept that sometimes your daughter won't like you when you're an AH.", "NTA - she ignored the blatant bullying of her daughter so that she could keep her husband.  Being married was more important than her daughter's safety and happiness.", "I wonder how Mom's going to like the ordered child support if Annabelle receives any state services, which if you have any contact info for the grandparents, you should notify them of that. Mom doesn't get to emotionally and FINANCIALLY abuse her kid. She NEEDS to pay support so any extra money doesn't get to spoil stepbrat.", "NTA. My answer to her text would be that she was never there for her daughter and why couldn\u2019t she accept that some sisters won\u2019t always like you so there is no reason why I should be there for her now.", "NTA  Ask her why she thinks she deserves to have someone there for her when she couldn't even be there for her own daughter. People like her end up alone. Wouldn't be a surprise if Jasmine now turns against your sister since Annabelle isn't a problem anymore.", "Which grandparents sued for custody?\n\nYou describe Annabelle as never having met her father.  Were his parents involved in her life?\n\nIf it was your mother, why do refer to them as Annabelle grandparents rather than your parents?", "NTA. It sounds like you were there for her.  You listened.  Being there for someone doesn't mean necessarily taking their side.  I really feel for your niece.  Sounds like her dad and mom are both deadbeats.", "Why should you be on her side? She's a horrible parent who prioritized having a spouse over their child's wellbeing. The fact that she didn't even intervene when her daughter was being alienated in her own family is egregious. NTA. I don't even know why she needs you tbh. She has a husband and is not single so she shouldn't be unhappy. And kudos to the grandparents that stepped up. I hope they love Anabelle deeply and care for her gently", "lol. So she basically asked her teen daughter \u2018Why are you asking me to give up this man so you can feel safe?\u2019 \n\nNTA. You tried to tell her. You tried to help. She wanted that man more than anything. Now she\u2019s got him and he and his turd of a daughter can pound sand.", "She needs to \u201caccept that some sisters won\u2019t always like you\u201d\n\nShe neglected her daughter once she shacked up. The \u201cparents\u201d didn\u2019t intervene when they should have and now she is surprised that her daughter doesn\u2019t want to live with them. She failed and now she wants support. For what?! No one in their right mind will say she\u2019s rightfully upset. NTA", "NTA. You could always remind your sister that at least she isn't \"single and unhappy\" and sometimes you have accept that some \"children won't always like you.\" /s", "NTA although I might have said to her, \"you just have to accept that some sisters don't like you\" \nSmiled and shut the door.", "NTA, good on Annabelle for having the emotional intelligence and self respect to get herself out of that situation though, and major respect for the grandparents.", "As a kid I was in the exact same position with my stepbrother. It still has never been addressed by my mother. You did the right thing, Annabelle prolly felt like she didn't have anyone but yall in her corner.

And when your sister put it to her daughter to make a choice of 'mommy being single and unhappy'.  That to me show that your sister is selfish in her own needs and not the needs of her daughter. No, sisters won't always 'like' you, but they will always love you and have your back when it's needed most.  in fact, Jasmine stated that she hated Annabelle.

It is tough to be thrown into a blended family, but there are ways to set boundaries and model behavior to make it easier.  She was given none of that.\n\nNatasha has no excuse.

You should've just asked her outright why she wasn't there for her own daughter. NTA.", "NTA. Granted, there may be some facts missing from the story. The fact that the judge placed the daughter in the grandparents' custody means they were able to show significant evidence of bullying and abuse. Keep supporting your niece as she will still be in a lot of pain because her mother basically rejected her in favor of her \"new\" family. That mom can pound sand!", "Nta, everytime you bought the situation up she always dismissed you like there wasn\u2019t anything going on.

When she says that you should still be there for her, tell her she should have been there for her daughter.", "That's my impression as well, she doesn't care about her daughter more how her leaving makes OP's sister look like a bad mother.\nThe comment about potentially ending up single was very telling as to the mother's priorities.", "Talking to your sister wasn't enough. Why didn't anyone try to get custody of her before now? Clearly the court would have sided with you/your family, as her grandparents had no trouble getting custody.  \n\nY'all let that child live in that situation for 11 years. Did anyone even offer to try to get custody, or did *she* have to plead for help from family before anyone thought to get her out of that house?", "Lol One of my current cats has avoided my niece like the plague ever since she was born. Kid comes over, cat disappears. She nine now, and the cat finally decided she\u2019s okay enough to sit on her lap a couple weeks ago. \u2018It\u2019s a Christmas Miracle aunty!\u2019", "For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s highly unlikely the court would have let the paternal grandparents have custody of Annabelle any earlier than now. For one, there\u2019s no way the grandparents had standing to ask for custody. If the court granted custody to them, it was because the judge found the teenager to be credible. However, it\u2019s amazing that they even listened to a 15 year old, let alone allowed grandparents with no right to custody have custody. If this story is true, I\u2019m wondering what evidence was presented of her abuse or how the conversation went between Annabelle and the judge (judges will often have 1-on-1 conversations with children dealing with custody cases surrounding allegations of abuse*, and particularly when it\u2019s a teenager that encouraged the custody case to happen). \n\nThe family members could have perhaps sooner allowed Annabelle to move in with them, but mom would have had a legal right to call the police to take her home or even have her arrested. \n\nAll of this is depending on the state of course. But these are the general rules. There\u2019s only so much other family members can do, and it\u2019s not particularly fair to demonize them for trying without also risking legal repercussions.\n\n*adding a caveat, they might do this with a child of any age, but judges, from my experience and training, are often unlikely to defer to them if they are not teenagers.", "NTA.  \n\n\nNope. I'd be blunt with her \"Why should anyone support you when all you had on your mind was having a husband and being in a relationship. You didn't give a damn about your daughter, no matter how many times we talked to you about it. Now that we do not have to go through you anymore, we can all can show Annabelle how much we love and care for her because you never did. I'm ashamed at how selfish you are.\"", "NTA\n\nBOTH your sister and her husband are assholes here - your sister failed to advocate for her own daughter, and her husband failed to intervene when his daughter was engaging in nasty bullying.\n\nFrankly these were two people who probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten married or moved in with each other. \n\n\u201cYour torment is an acceptable price for my happiness\u201d will never be something that Annabelle will forget. And it\u2019s not a position that she, your sister, should have sympathy for.\n\nI\u2019d even suggest what Natasha was doing was actually abusive, but was dismissed and downplayed due to her age. There\u2019s a VAST difference between not wanting to be friends with someone and Jasmine\u2019s behavior.\n\nShe put her child in an enviroment to be abused by another child for a decade, and now wants sympathy? No.", "NTA\n\nThat poor child was abandoned by her father, and emotionally abandoned by her mother.\n\nYour sister deserved the harsh words. Maybe one day she'll figure out why. Until then, just be the best support you can for Annabelle.", "Should have thrown back at her that she should accept that \u201csome sisters won\u2019t always like you\u201d", "Tell her you\u2019re just being there for her like she was for her daughter. \nUse her own line on her- Tell her that some sisters just won\u2019t always like one another and she needs to accept that. \n\nNTA.", "Yeah", "Its never productive to tell someone you don't feel sorry for them", "It's also that Annabelle's step-dad clearly never did anything to stop his daughter's behavior. I know sometimes with step parents/kids it can be hard to step over that line to fully parent, but OP's sister never did anything to defend her daughter, and clearly she never spoke to her husband about her step daughter's behavior. That would have been enough to show Annabelle that she really cared.", "Sounds like Jasmine needed to be in therapy to accept the reality that she wasn't always going to have her Dad's full attention and he was going to be re-partnered eventually.  This wasn't done for her.  Under that circumstance, she's going to go for the jugular because it's the only way Natasha would leave her Dad.  She assumed Natasha wouldn't be able to let Annabelle be abused, so of course they would have to leave and she would get Dad's full attention back again.  She miscalculated.  Natasha's emotional need for a partner overrode her maternal responsibility to keep her daughter safe.\n\nNatasha also screwed up by hyping the \"you're going to have a sister!\" angle to Annabelle.  Respect and courtesy should be demanded.  Love and affection has to grow organically and can't be forced.  That poor girl was probably so happy and excited, and didn't see Jasmine not having the same reaction coming.", "Yes it is.  \n\n\nsome people thrive off attention, and if they don't get that validation it may be the catalyst they need to finally do something about their behavior.", "It is when the person has a victim complex.", "I dont think withdrawing from a toxic family member is being an AH.  Annabelles rearing she was at best negligent to her daughter, willingly sacrificed  her daughter as the cost of being married. Why would OP comfort her for facing the well earned consequences of her actions ?", "The way its written out... why does Natasha even care?  She doesn't seem to care for her kid.  Is she just embarrassed at having her daughter taken away?  Its mortifying.  I just can't imagine her caring about her kid, this is weird.", "This was my situation with my Dad and step mother, except SM was the bully (he remarried after my Mum died suddenly when I was a kid). I'm now 32 and happily married, but the pain and betrayal of your parent choosing their abusive spouse over you is not something you can get over - even with  years of therapy. I'm so glad Annabelle has other supportive family members to ensure she feels secure and happy. Wishing her the best for all the pain she's enduring.", "Thank you all for being there for Annabelle. All I could picture was you all going well, yeah of course this happened. Meanwhile your sister is standing there all surprised pikachu. I am just glad Annabelle is in a better situation. I am sad that Jasmine has been let down by lack of parenting which will surely hinder her ability to be a successful adult.", "My gods!! Your poor niece Annabelle & the fact your sister failed miserably to see the true picture until it smacked her hard in the judges courtroom. \n\nNTA OP.  I'm glad that your niece is now living with her grandparent & free of the stress when  your sister just did not truly care for her own biological child.\n\nI'm not going to be surprised that Annabelle goes no contact towards her egg donor Natasha.", "I have never understood people that tie that much of their self worth to being in a relationship. When you\u2019re that incapable of accepting yourself or being with yourself, a relationship isn\u2019t going to fix you.", "You did say she tried to guilt trip Annabelle by asking if Annabelle preferred her to be single and unhappy. Your sister doesn\u2019t find happiness in being Annabelle\u2019s mother, she finds it in being someone\u2019s wife.", "> Being married and/or in a relationship ***STILL IS*** Natasha's top priority.\n\nFixed that for you. She is still more interested in herself than the well-being of her daughter.", "Art therapy or sandtray are great at her age, often far more effective than purely talk-based approaches as they connect more with where her brain development is at. (for reference I'm a therapist who often refers teen clients for art therapy when I feel it more appropriate)", "This will sound horrible but please tell me you all dropped Jasmine like a hot potato afterwards. Like no contact, no gifts. Nothing.", "And that is why the judge agreed. I\u2019m pretty sure Jasmine didn\u2019t pull any punches or lie to the judge.", "Considering this post was written by the brother of the mom, and doesn\u2019t go into any weird specifics, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.", "Yeah judges will side with caution every time. I got in trouble because someone had taunted me and used my response as evidence that I was hostile. And I was like hell yeah I was hostile, she tried to stab me before that video started!\n\nThere was no proof she tried to stab me.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about it for another year.", "I'm so glad Annabelle is getting a fresh start. I hope she gets into therapy and leaves all that ugliness behind her.", "She should\u2019ve said \u201cyou should\u2019ve been there for Annabelle.

Herself? Randos on instgram? Definitely not working on her actual close relatives. She\u2019s delusional, but my mother is the same way. Everyone knows it\u2019s not working out but you have to pretend to make them save face over their own actions over and over. Narc. Bs. She will probably make up some story about how she\u2019s a victim to the courts to convince the dumbest amongst us that she\u2019s not at fault for what happened.", "Natasha\u2019s burned her bridges, the only reason people kept putting out fires was for Annabelle\u2019s sake. This is no longer a circus they need to attend.", "Just imagine what the other moms are saying about her, \u2018that\u2019s the woman who let her daughter leave because her step daughter was bullying her.\u2019", "I was about to say, \"Is that you, Jasmine?\"", "I mean you can put it all together: \n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing what you did for Annabelle.

That was heartbreaking to read tbh.", "I'm 2 years older than my sister. From our teenage years we fought like cat and dog. I left home at nineteen and we never spoke again, which is sad really.

Our mum and dad have a lot to answer to.", "I'm not sure it could be said any better than that. Bravo.", "This exactly.

My grandparents took custody of me at 16 and my dad RAGED and raged because why did he have to give THEM money? They were well off, they didn't need money!
