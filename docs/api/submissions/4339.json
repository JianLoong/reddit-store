He agreed to the deal. \n\nOf course it might be a good idea to talk this over in a calm and adult manner with your husband because you'll either have to find a compromise or move out. Living in a household where parents are on bad terms with each other isn't ideal.

If she's actually working from home 8 hours a day then her stance makes sense, if a bit petty. If however she's working 4 hours a day then I don't think it's particularly fair.

So she should be doing her part in the bills as well. So he can have fun money. Doesn't have to be all of it.

She is earning money without paying her share of the bills and not even using the money she earns on her family but on herself. That is where she is selfish and not doing her fair share. If she is doing the cooking/cleaning/childcare/tutoring then why would they need to hire others to do it? She's not just some employee, she's the mother, she's obligating to doing them.

They're just not benefitting in the same way. \n\nWhat I consider to be the lesser end of the deal is the fact that he was angry at the idea of him doing house chores and child rearing, until he realized that she could spoil herself too. All of a sudden, it became an unfair separation of roles. Bet that, had she just saved the money in a separate account, spent some on stuff he doesn't know about or doesn't realize the cumulative cost (like weekly facials and massages, going out for lunch with friends, etc.), he would have been fine with keeping the arrangement as is. \n\nWhat mattered most is that she does not get something that he does not. And this is what sucks most about this deal.\n\nETA : He was PERFECTLY fine with the division of labour when she was doing all of the homemaking stuff ON TOP of using her savings to pay half the expenses. Not once did he think that it would put his wife in a precarious position. Not once did he think \"if she pays for half of the house expenses, I should do half the homemaking\".

The issue with going back to the way things were is that there is no guarantee that he\u2019ll actually pull his weight. So it\u2019ll be just like it is now. Except OP will also pay bills.
