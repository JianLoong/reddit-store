He agreed to the deal. \n\nOf course it might be a good idea to talk this over in a calm and adult manner with your husband because you'll either have to find a compromise or move out. Living in a household where parents are on bad terms with each other isn't ideal.

Now he wants to go back and she does not. \nSo please tell me where is his compromise? \n \nIt really does sounds like from what your suggesting that she needs to do the compromising and he just \u201clearned his lesson\u201d. \nIf anything, the lesson here is he\u2019ll throw a fit every single time to get his way.\n\nCompromise involves two people, but he needs to show he is willing to actually compromise not just expect his way. Which is what looks like is happening.", "Thanks for laying this out. I\u2019m trying to get to the \u201ctiptop shape\u201d phase of the house to start a routine like this. Couple questions:\n\n* are you vacuuming the entire house every day or just a room at a time?\n* when do you declutter/dust?\n* I\u2019m assuming you clean the whole kitchen (stove, sink, etc.) every day, correct? \n\nSorry to derail like this but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who covets this system! Also, NTA of course", "A) you are a queen to balance and stay on top of all of these things B) with the current situation, you are working 14+ hours a day plus weekends, compared to your husband being gone from the house about 10 hours per day, M-F. It seems to me that your contribution to the household is equal to his with all you do to keep the house running and take care of your child (probably more, if we\u2019re looking at work hours). The four hours a day you work is on top of everything else you do, so by that logic, you should keep that money. One the one hand, if he wants to \u201cmake things more equal\u201d he needs to put in a lot more hours each week cooking, cleaning, and taking care of your kid. On the other hand, you seem to be very good at multitasking and juggling many complex jobs at once, so when you get the \u201cnew\u201d arrangement down and are happily balancing everything, is he going to resent that too, and insist you change things again? It seems to me this is about your husband resenting how capable you are, and how easy you make it look as a result, not about an even split of responsibility", "Yep, the only answer that would make the husband happy is having his cake and eating it too.", "But is that a bad thing? Your preferences and life is allowed to change, what's the bad thing about checking in every now and then? Not to excuse the husband, because he sounds like a dick. But y'all should be having conversations with y'all spouses", "True, but it sounds like the husband might actually participate in that conversation now.", "That\u2019s honestly what healthy relationships look like though.

Nah. That shit doesn't change yearly. That would be impossible to maintain.", "I have never known anyone in my entire life that regularly discussed who is going to work, who is going to not work, and who gets to control or access money. If that changes every year you'd both go crazy. Most people don't change that once in their whole marriage, at least not intentionally as a directed decision.", "Sure, I was speaking to why it would be valuable, not whether it would happen. That said, he refused couples' counseling earlier. That does not necessarily mean it would refuse it now.

By no stretch of the imagination am I disagreeing with OP here.", "lol wut", "Then carve 1hour or 30 minutes a day to do a \"deep clean task\".

It would be one thing if y\u2019all were struggling, but if everything is getting paid, and he isn\u2019t burning out/breaking down mentally/emotionally, then it\u2019s really shitty of him to try and just flip it back", "NTA\n\n>he is saying that he wants to get back to \"how things used to be\".\n\nOf course he does!

He wants you to stay home, do the chores, raise the children, stick with your WFH job, and  contribute to bills and groceries while he works and contributes to bills and groceries, and he thinks that is balanced?  He will try to make it a \"gender roles\" argument when in reality, it is a question of you doing the most work while he gets all of the benefits.  \n\nIt all comes down to whether or not you want in on this marriage.

All he needs to do is take care of the bills, which he would have to do anyway PLUS take care of the house and make his own lunches if OP wasn't in the picture. I get the bills are going to be a bit more expensive because it's more people, but he doesn't need to give her an allowance for her own interests because she's still earning enough to do that herself.\n\nThis new tantrum seems to be bought on by her buying something for herself and him just getting jealous.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to say, \"The current dynamic isn't working for me, can we try something else?\" But the thing is, he did that twice already and each time SHE is the one who compromised and SHE is the one who made it work for her. He can't just keep doing this to her without some reassurance that he will take responsibility for making it work for him. He can't expect HER to keep switching it around on HIS whim, with no compromise on his part.", "He wants a bigger piece of his paycheck to stay in his pocket is what he wants. He doesn't want an agreement that doesn't suit his desires.", "My thoughts exactly. He only wants to change things because he saw OP was able to manage her half of the deal and whip up a side gig to make some extra cash, effectively holding two jobs.

You're amazing.

I really wonder if since she upgraded her car if she can now no longer afford to contribute financially to the household like she used to and that is the reason she is refusing.", "Often the case on both points.", "I mean, it depends why? I've had a handful of very heated arguments before, and giving everyone a chance to think about things while not arguing has usually been a net positive for everyone.\n\nPeople can say things in the heat of the moment that they can't take back, even if they don't mean it.

In my family who ever had the kids with them had the better car.  \n\nI remember once my dad just took off for a drive in the newer car when I was young.
