This is not on you, a 12 year old can both take instruction and deal with the consequences of being a little shit to his older siblings. Nta.", "NTA and your brother is being enabled to be a brat. Do show them the link to this thread. Running with a laptop? Not only did he make you late(r) to class, but what would have happened if he'd tripped with it? Would you have gotten in trouble? Would it have been replaced immediately? Would your dad and step-mom have called the school to explain that you would not have your laptop today through no fault of your own? Would he have been grounded for several days, and lost his allowance and extra money until the cost of the laptop was recovered? If the answer to any of those is not in your favor...your family has a problem. Also, you were 13. Your stepmom and dad are grown-ass adults. If they couldn't realize this was time for a bit of family therapy and understanding for a hurting teen, this is NOT ON YOU.  \n\n\nEdited to add: INFO: by calling her your life's downfall, did your dad cheat with her? And where is your mom? Your current situation just sounds very unhealthy if it's as you described it. She ought to know ASAP.", "NTA - I see nothing wrong with how you acted.", "NTA. Sounds like she was looking for an excuse to start cutting you out since you are now 18.", "NTA, but your dad definitely is for allowing his stepson and wife to get away with this behavior towards you.", "NTA. Their reaction is wildly out of line and I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. It sounds like your stepmom was waiting for you to become an adult so she can begin pushing you out. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA - your stepbrother needs to learn to leave other people's property alone & stop this nonsense", "NTA this is a massive overreaction on her part, just completely uncalled for and unnecessary. She went nuclear before you told her to fuck off to be fair as well.", "NTA go NC if they are punishing you", "NTA - unless you want to go on vacation with them, don\u2019t apologize. If you do wanna go on vacation, then apologize but secretly don\u2019t mean it.", "NTA - If she wants to be a parent and wield discipline, she needs to do it even-handedly.  Your brother continually and intentionally delays your attempting to leave the house on time, and yet she hasn't put a stop to it.  So he keeps doing it, as one does when their misbehavior is not stopped, and it builds up on you.  Sooner or later, you were bound to lose your temper.  She knew or should have known that.", "NTA. And you brother was lucky all you did was yell at him. You may be better off not going on this trip though, it sounds like it would be miserable.", "NTA. They overreacted.", "NTA\n\nBut you and Sarah need to have a discussion that includes your dad about how your stepbrother will be handled because this irksome morning routine is not how any adult should start their day. \n\nDoes Sarah want you to tattle on your SB every time he takes something of yours? That might be the next step.  If she finds that annoying, inform her that she\u2019s made it so you can\u2019t handle the situation yourself.  \n\nYour SB shouldn\u2019t go on vacation as a reward for his bratty behavior either.", "NTA. Many of my nieces and nephews are about your stepbrother's age. They know that if one of them so much as touches my laptop without permission, I can and will snatch a knot in their tails. So getting yelled at for something he knows he shouldn't do is mild.", "NTA.  Youll be allowed on vacation if you apologize.  Just tell your dad your step brother keeps stealing your stuff cause he thinks it\u2019s funny.  It\u2019ll all blow over and be fine", "NTA brothers and sisters squabble. It\u2019s as old as time. Explain to your Dad and Step mother that all siblings bicker, and over time these little blips will blow over as everyone matures.\n\nNobody needs to be banned from the family for squabbling. And if given the opportunity, everyone will begin to blend together. After all, both parents want and are building a blended family. What good is it for the future of the family if one of the members of the family are suddenly shunned?\n\nBoth the 12 year old and you should equally apologize to each other. That\u2019s it. This isn\u2019t a big hairy deal, nor should it be treated like one. \n\nIt\u2019s kids bickering, not WW3. Everyone needs to relax and allow the parent to ask everyone to apologize, and then the kids (you are still a kid OP) apologize, and everyone gets on with the job of building a family.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what you are all doing. You are building a family. Let\u2019s not start chucking family members into the wilderness quite yet.", "NTA. You are not in a supportive home. Your stepbrother is being encouraged to sabotage you, and your stepmom thinks that's peachy-keen. She held you to a much higher standard when you were his age, and has been punishing you ever since you failed to be an adult back then. Best to move out.", "NTA. 12 or not, a kid in our house would have gotten a tanned bottom, not just for stealing someone else\u2019s stuff but with being so reckless with such an expensive piece of equipment! He/she would also have wanted to die from all the lectures and yelling that accompanied such a stupid stunt.", "NTA, a twelve year old if more than capable of accepting consequences and understanding their own actions, have you sat down with your mum and dad to have a calm, frank discussion on what happened and how it's made you feel? Because if they've only heard it from step mums side they might not have the full picture", "NTA. At 12 my sister would have clocked me. Shes 6 years older. Damage done for now. Take the time by yourself and figure out what you want going forward.", "NTA She needs to parent her child. That's unacceptable behaviour from a 12 year old.", "First and foremost you are NTA. Your stepmom and dad are TAH. The 12 year old is a brat and the adults in the home are enabling the brat by not setting boundaries on your personal property and space.  I feel really bad for you. Maybe you can find a way to move out and distance yourself from them.", "So your a 18F and you are going to have the house to your self? Wow, I wonder what ever could you do? ANYTHING you want!!!!", "She was 13 and her parents divorced. Shes 18 now. Its been 5 years and he likely remarried shortly after the divorce. \u201cOp has been a bitch for years\u201d lmao she was a literal child most of said time in a growing period her life was upended. Most teens have that \u201cstruggle phase\u201d with parents. Let alone in this situation. If the stepmom expected open arms shes an idiot. She was the adult. Try but give space. Kids come around.", "NTA. Sarah was looking for the first possible flimsy excuse to get you booted from the holiday and she found it. In that situation as a parent, I would have got you both in trouble but the son more so. A laptop is not a toy for him to mess with and he shouldn't be winding up his sister. But then I would also have dealt with it the first time he thought it was funny to run off with OP's stuff. Sarah is a piece of work and so is your dad for being more concerned about getting laid than telling his wife to pull her head in. This is typical siblings squabbling, OP didn't even start it and no where near the level of actions that deserve to be booted from holidays.", "NTA I hate it when full grown adults are like you\u2019re 18 you\u2019re an adult. Legally sure, but not emotionally.", "NTA.  Everyone else in this story is.", "NTA but your sarah is and your dad is a coward", "ESH - your stepbrother sucks because he keeps taking your stuff.  Your dad and stepmum suck because they don't discipline your stepbrother.  Your stepmum sucks because she went a nuclear option. You suck because you told your stepmum to fuck off when you were pissed off at your brother.\n\nI think that you should apologize to your stepmum for telling her to fuck off.  \n\nIt sounds like you and your stepmum do get on ok, and by your own admission, as a young teen you think you didn't handle that time well, you may think about if you should apologize for saying that your stepmum never liked you.  But thats definitely something you need to think and be retropective about within yourself.\n\nYou may need to talk with your dad and stepmum about your brothers behavior and your feelings about it so that they understand where you are coming from and why you were so upset that particular day", "Telling your stepmom to f off never ends well. It was extreme with them not taking you on the family vacation. Dad should have spoken up on that. You told stepmom she didn't like you and acting all hurt by it kind of. You don't like her, or if you actually do, she obviously doesn't know that due to the way you admitted you treated her in the beginning. You got back what you dished out in that scenario so you're not exactly blameless as you kind of alluded to. Your best bet is to literally sit down with your stepmom as a young adult and have a talk. There's definitely issues on both sides that need to finally be dealt with.\n\nNow as far as yelling at a 12 year old. You stated when 12 year old did stuff like that the stepmom sided with you. But this time she said you went too far. I could see that. When an adult is screaming at the top of their lungs red in the face with that evil look in their eyes, that's going to be very scary to a 12 year old child. Everyone here who thinks that's ok ALL being the same ones when some 25 year old posts about their father or mother screaming at them and saying how that's just wrong are lying to you. If it's wrong for an adult it's definitely wrong to do it to a child.", "YTA - I get it but you missed the exit in your anger and took it to another level.

Unfortunately, it's very common for the bio kid of one parent or the other to be shut out in favor of the stepkids. Blended families can't all be the Brady Bunch. It seems that SM is (and has been for a while) trying to get you out of the pic as much as possible so Dad can focus on SB more than you; most parents do in fact think their own children are more important than everyone else's, especially in blended families. The baffling part to me is Dad not sticking up for you. Don't apologize, don't go on vacation, and start looking for alternative living arrangements ASAP. Keep all of your stuff in your own room and make sure SB can't get to it. Put a lock on every bag you have if necessary, since a lock on your bedroom door is probably out of the question. If he's not given the opportunity to get into your stuff, he'll give up eventually. Also, never leave your bedroom with the need to do *anything* before you leave for class, work, etc. You can usually eat on the way or as soon as you get there if you have time. Another thing, since your presence in the household does cause some strife, keep to yourself at all times unless you're specifically invited to something or expected to show up for a family meal. It sucks having to exile yourself, but if they don't want you there, then don't force your company on them. Maybe when your absence starts to be noticed and questioned, the lines of communication can be reopened and you can explain yourself. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nDo you have a lock on your door?

I literally lived this life.  You\u2019re a teenager and she is the adult.  Anyone who expects a warm welcome from a teen who just had their life upended by divorce is both an idiot and an asshole.  I know how painful this is, and it isn\u2019t probably much about Sarah, but more about your dad choosing her side.\n\nYour brother needs to grow up.  Honestly, at 12 it almost sounds like he has some sort of weird infatuation.  He seems too old to play a game like that.\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t change any of it.  Keep your head low, try to avoid major blow ups, and focus on when you can move out.  Apologize to Sarah now, not\nbecause you were wrong, but because it\u2019s the path of least resistance.  Always take the path of least resistance with her.  I promise, anything else won\u2019t get what you want and will just be more painful.  Trust me.\n\nEventually, make the family you never had.

Best to come back and talk to dad and Stepmom about this incident when everyone is calm and not caught up in their emotions, yeah? Ask them both to sit down and talk about it, apologize for screaming at your brother and telling your stepmom to eff off, because screaming almost never gets you anywhere (it's good practice for later in life anyway) and telling housemates to eff off is rude. Point out that's it's REALLY frustrating when your brother steals your stuff, especially when you're late, and that you already have a lot on your plate with school and all that. Tell them you'd really like to come on vacation with them (if you want to). I wouldn't say you were the asshole, but teenage emotions can be a rollercoaster, eh? \n\n\nSometimes there is wisdom in just keeping the peace, and that wisdom will see you through similar situations in life.", "I bet the real reason is she doesn't want you as part of the family anymore and feels your father should cut you off now that you're 18.

Pick up something of hers so he thinks you're going to need it, watch him run off with it, and enjoy the show."]}
