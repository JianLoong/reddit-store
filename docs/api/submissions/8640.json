In that situation as a parent, I would have got you both in trouble but the son more so. A laptop is not a toy for him to mess with and he shouldn't be winding up his sister. But then I would also have dealt with it the first time he thought it was funny to run off with OP's stuff.

Your dad and stepmum suck because they don't discipline your stepbrother.  Your stepmum sucks because she went a nuclear option. You suck because you told your stepmum to fuck off when you were pissed off at your brother.\n\nI think that you should apologize to your stepmum for telling her to fuck off.  \n\nIt sounds like you and your stepmum do get on ok, and by your own admission, as a young teen you think you didn't handle that time well, you may think about if you should apologize for saying that your stepmum never liked you.  But thats definitely something you need to think and be retropective about within yourself.\n\nYou may need to talk with your dad and stepmum about your brothers behavior and your feelings about it so that they understand where you are coming from and why you were so upset that particular day", "Telling your stepmom to f off never ends well. It was extreme with them not taking you on the family vacation. Dad should have spoken up on that. You told stepmom she didn't like you and acting all hurt by it kind of. You don't like her, or if you actually do, she obviously doesn't know that due to the way you admitted you treated her in the beginning. You got back what you dished out in that scenario so you're not exactly blameless as you kind of alluded to. Your best bet is to literally sit down with your stepmom as a young adult and have a talk. There's definitely issues on both sides that need to finally be dealt with.\n\nNow as far as yelling at a 12 year old. You stated when 12 year old did stuff like that the stepmom sided with you. But this time she said you went too far. I could see that. When an adult is screaming at the top of their lungs red in the face with that evil look in their eyes, that's going to be very scary to a 12 year old child. Everyone here who thinks that's ok ALL being the same ones when some 25 year old posts about their father or mother screaming at them and saying how that's just wrong are lying to you. If it's wrong for an adult it's definitely wrong to do it to a child.", "YTA - I get it but you missed the exit in your anger and took it to another level.

Unfortunately, it's very common for the bio kid of one parent or the other to be shut out in favor of the stepkids. Blended families can't all be the Brady Bunch. It seems that SM is (and has been for a while) trying to get you out of the pic as much as possible so Dad can focus on SB more than you; most parents do in fact think their own children are more important than everyone else's, especially in blended families. The baffling part to me is Dad not sticking up for you. Don't apologize, don't go on vacation, and start looking for alternative living arrangements ASAP. Keep all of your stuff in your own room and make sure SB can't get to it. Put a lock on every bag you have if necessary, since a lock on your bedroom door is probably out of the question. If he's not given the opportunity to get into your stuff, he'll give up eventually. Also, never leave your bedroom with the need to do *anything* before you leave for class, work, etc. You can usually eat on the way or as soon as you get there if you have time. Another thing, since your presence in the household does cause some strife, keep to yourself at all times unless you're specifically invited to something or expected to show up for a family meal.

Ask them both to sit down and talk about it, apologize for screaming at your brother and telling your stepmom to eff off, because screaming almost never gets you anywhere (it's good practice for later in life anyway) and telling housemates to eff off is rude. Point out that's it's REALLY frustrating when your brother steals your stuff, especially when you're late, and that you already have a lot on your plate with school and all that. Tell them you'd really like to come on vacation with them (if you want to). I wouldn't say you were the asshole, but teenage emotions can be a rollercoaster, eh? \n\n\nSometimes there is wisdom in just keeping the peace, and that wisdom will see you through similar situations in life.", "I bet the real reason is she doesn't want you as part of the family anymore and feels your father should cut you off now that you're 18.

Which he gets and it does satisfy him which is why he will keep doing it. ~~The best bet is to continuously nag your stepmother, like every 5 seconds, when he takes something from you. Like say \"X has taken my Y, can you tell him to give it back. He still hasn't given it back. I am getting late, when is he going to give it back. I really need it now.\" etc. This will drive your stepmother insane and while initially she will explode on you she will learn to shift to her son when she realises you won't stop.~~\n\nAt age 12 he should realise his behaviour is extremely wrong, so this is either an attempt to get attention from you OR get back at you for something in the past that turned into a habit OR someone is telling him to do so. Whether you want to find out why he does it is up to you and doesn't play much into this anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, your stepmother is enabling him and it seems to be a 'golden child' scenario. The punishment that is no way indicative of what you have done. You should realise by now that your brother is entitled as he sees no issue taking your stuff and your stepmother is enabling this behaviour. If you want more proof, ask yourself how many times you've had to make do with less so that your lil bro got something he wanted etc.\n\nTo top this off, I am concerned with your work. Running with a laptop can lead to very bad consequences should he fall. I would consider making sure you have 3-2-1 backups. This rule is at least 3 copies of your data, of which 2 is locally stored on different media and the third is stored off-site. So if you have an essay, you would have one copy on your C drive, another on your D drive and the third on a USB stick. For extra contingency you should place a copy in cloud storage (that's usually done automatically by the word editor so just check to make sure its automatically doing it).\n\nEDIT: After seeing that you live at home while studying for college ~~and you might be relying on them for tuition~~ I revoke the suggestion of annoying stepmother. You should try and lay low until you can leave. This unfortunately requires you to apologise despite it not being your fault. There is very little you can do without making your life hell. I would start trying to become independent, this can start off from doing your own laundry, cooking for yourself with groceries you bought, getting a job etc and then looking into moving out either to your mother's or look into renting with friends or something.\n\nAs for whether you can salvage the relationship, it honestly depends on how forgiving/open the stepmother is.
