We are planning a wedding in the fall of \u201824 and have started a guest list. She comes from a big family and I am an only child. We are close with one of her sisters in particular, and often went to visit her and play board games and such. This sister has a fianc\u00e9 and is pregnant. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this.

Do not allow this to become a discussion focused on her attending that one day.  That is a discussion for months from now and is irrelevant at the moment.  Your problem is with your fianc\u00e9.  She knew you were being excluded and not only kept it from you but doubled down by not coming clean when you asked to go in to congratulate the couple.  Something is very wrong here and you need to have a lot of honest discussions before you decide if there should even be a wedding.

You are still in the \"best behavior\" stage of your relationship.\n\nYou have just had a peek at what is lurking behind the honeymoon stage of your relationship.\n\nWill she always go along with and side with members of her family over you? Will she go out of her way to avoid standing up for you? She didn't even make up an excuse to spare you by not allowing you to come into the venue. Instead, she let you be humiliated by finding out that you and only you were not invited in FRONT of the rest of the guests.\n\nAlso, did she even push back at her sister when her sister told her you weren't invited? Your fiance had to have know in advance that you were the only one not invited.

You didn't deserve to be treated like that. It honestly sounds like you deserve better.", "NTA. Currently you\u2019re in second place to her sister, and maybe even the rest of the family. Pause the engagement and get to the bottom of this NOW before you marry her. There\u2019s something deeper here. You were purposely excluded, and your fianc\u00e9 knew.

Obviously, she doesn't.\n\nFrom what you say, it is unmistakable that she was in on the decision to bar you from this party, and she not only was happy to do that but then pretended to be confused when you asked what was going on.\n\nAsk yourself what motivation this fianc\u00e9e has for creating a relationship that is on her part totally phony.

Make sure it\u2019s spontaneous and not a planned outing.  If there\u2019s any time between the ask and the actual meeting he will tell the sister and they will have him give the same lame excuse.  Keep in mind they don\u2019t mind you throwing money at them but don\u2019t want you present at all.  Realize your the ATM or the person to do the things no one else wants to.

You will marry into this and receive years more. Be Damn sure this woman is worth it. She certainly is not going to back you against her family. Not inviting close family members will just confirm their negative opinions about you. Also, you sound a bit controlling.

We are close with one of her sisters in particular, and often went to visit her and play board games and such. This sister has a fianc\u00e9 and is pregnant. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And she needs to broach this with her sister.", "NTA.  But I want details.  Wife told you why you weren't invited.  You did something to upset them to the point of not wanting you at their wedding.  What was it?", "NTA but I would ask your fianc\u00e9 sister why you weren\u2019t invited. I mean, of course it was an AH move not inviting just you, but if you used to be close there must be a reason to this.", "I think you might be blaming the wrong party here. If your fiance is OK with her sister excluding you like this then you should be rethinking your relationship dynamics.", "NTA. I wouldnt invite them either and I would stop helping them. I bet she will have a shocked Pikachu face when she realizes that you won\u2019t help her anymore.", "NTA\n\nas others have said, your problem is not the guest list for a party a year from now, your problem is that you are rushing into marriage with someone you clearly don't know enough about. There is something sketchy going on, you fianc\u00e9 knows it and she doesn't want you to find out. Don't get married until you figure this out.", "NTA - BUT, your fianc\u00e9 is definitely an asshole. She obviously knew this all along and kept it from you.

Do you really wanna marry someone like this? Yall should be a team, and to tell you \"maybe you did something to upset them\" is just out of pocket. Sounds like she has her sisters back over anyone. And that isn't good for a relationship.", "OP, NTA for this situation.\n\n\nBut you will be if you marry this woman.  She does not have your back.  She is not your partner.\n\nAnd worst of all - she lies to you.  Why would you want that in your life?  She showed you who she really is.  Believe that truth.  Let the trash take itself out. You deserve better.", "NTA dude your fiance 100% knew you were the only one invited, I\u2019d rethink even having a wedding", "NTA I\u2019d be more concerned about the lying from your fianc\u00e9 than the sister. They obviously knew that you weren\u2019t invited specifically and kept up an act to hide it from you. If they can do it for this what else will they hide from you.  All trust has been broken and it\u2019s shown that your aren\u2019t as close with the family as you thought you were. You\u2019ve only been together a year, cut your losses before it gets worse.", "NTA.  Something stinks here and your fianc\u00e9e knows what it is.  You need to find out before things go any further.", "Don't gloss over the comments, everyone is on point, you're focused on the wrong thing. I've been there, you just want someone to love you so bad that you overlook all the lying, gaslighting and red flags that they throw at you. Your fiancee lied to you, she knows damn well why you weren't invited. I had an ex who talked shit behind my back any chance he got and the fact that she didn't back you up and purposely being sneaky let's me know she probably does the same thing. Please rethink this relationship,  NTA get some self esteem, she doesn't love you.", "ESH. Plenty of bad behavior on the part of your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family, but to text your fianc\u00e9e to tell her that her sister can\u2019t come to your wedding is a very poor way to be starting a marriage. It\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s wedding too, and decisions should be made jointly. \n\nIt would be much more respectful to talk to your fianc\u00e9e face-to-face and tell her how you feel. Also, if you truly believe that you have been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family, then you may have been thoughtless or inconsiderate with realizing it. Be prepared to listen to another point of view on how you have offended them. \n\nIf you are intent on uninviting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister against your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s will, you might reconsider your wedding.", "I also get some vibes here concerning wedding pictures. Like, they don't want OP in the pics. Possibly because he's not going to be in the family after all????", "NTA for your reaction, AND you have a serious problem with your fianc\u00e9e. She knew you weren\u2019t invited to the wedding and kept it from you - disrespectful. What do you get out of this relationship?", "NTA and your fiance is gaslighting you HARD. I would strongly suggest to have an honest conversation about it.

This doesn't make sense to me why the sister and her new husband would do something like that. You've done a lot for them, and they purposely excluded you. You're supposed to be marrying into the family, so it's not like they can say \"only serious couples.\" \n\nAbsolutely NTA.

In the US, this would be considered a whirlwind relationship, getting engaged in less than half a year, but I'm aware that other cultures may operate differently.\n\nFurther info: Are you in any way different than your fiance's family, i.e. disabled, a different race or skin color, or a different social class? Every time I see one of these stories on Reddit where someone is excluded, it's racism or something similar. \n\nI'm just thinking that your fiance's family either disapproves of your relationship or is embarrassed by you in some way. More info is needed to determine whether their dislike is legitimate.", "NTA. Watson, the game is afoot. I agree with others that something went on behind OP\u2019s back. If OP\u2019s engagement survives, perhaps he can change his stance to no plus ones. \n\nAnd for crying out loud, is wedding season always this crazy on Reddit?", "NTA. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going far enough with simply uninviting these people from your wedding. Your fianc\u00e9e was clearly aware this was happening and was complicit in both excluding you AND lying to you about it. And her only response is a weak excuse about how you maybe inadvertently angered someone? \nYour fianc\u00e9e and her family are using you, treating you like garbage, and lying to you like you\u2019re an idiot. I strongly recommend you find a new partner who respects and appreciates you.", "NTA\n\nBut engaged at six months and only known each other less than a year? This is moving way too fast. \n\nI\u2019d easily dump somebody when they and their entire family made me second class and not a full member. But if you decide to stay, and I hope you don\u2019t, you need to postpone the wedding. \n\nDo you really want to sign on to a lifetime of this? They\u2019re just using and taking advantage of you. It\u2019s all so dysfunctional and toxic. \n\nWhen a relationship is rushed, it glosses over the red flags. Makes me wonder if your fianc\u00e9 rushed things, to get you invested before you see the ugly side. \n\nThis is who all of them are. You won\u2019t be able to change this. Better to leave and find someone who is kind and has a kind family who welcomes you. \n\nDon\u2019t stay. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. Sometimes bad experiences are blessings in disguise. Yes you got rejected, but you also got the gift of being shown exactly why you need to leave your fianc\u00e9 before things progress. Do it quickly, and meanwhile use birth control so you don\u2019t make things worse for yourself.", "You have a fianc\u00e9 problem as she knew about this and kept it from you. You need to have couples counseling before going through with any wedding.", ">She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited\n\n\"What did you do to make them hurt you?\" Is more often than not a bad look for the person doing it, and I'd expect this behaviour to repeat in future. Your future wife lied to your face about it being no plus one's and then blamed you, and doesn't have your back on this. She will probably always choose her sister, or even her extended family, over you. You will probably never be considered \"part\" of her family if this is the case.\n\nI would question if she's at all worth marrying.\n\nNTA", "Nta, you've done a lot for the sister, could her husband be jealous or insecure and it's coming from him? Still shitty, and your fianc\u00e9 should have stuck up for you and told you what was up, regardless of everything I would definitely cut all support to anyone in that family though, and I hope your fiance sorts out her priorities", "NTA and you should seriously consider at minimum postponing that wedding of yours\u2026", "NTA. But your fianc\u00e9 is and so is her sister. Your fianc\u00e9 could have been honest with you and not string you along or made you embarrassed by having you show up.

Otherwise her family events in future will be very awkward. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe her sister who you\u2019ve done so much for is banning you from her wedding and there is no bad blood or history between you two.

I think you really need to reevaluate your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 after this.

You need to be asking why your fianc\u00e9 let it happen and snuck it behind you back.  She backstabbed you even more than her sister and family did.\n\nBy the way.  This makes her a liar.  She lied to you.  To your face.  With full knowledge of what she was doing.", "I read the 3 replies you gave and I hope you\u2019re going to dig into the issue more, because this is nonsense.

And you need to make sure she knows, the engagment/marriage is on the line if she doesnt get her head on straight. This was rude and terrible and they really do not deserve an invite when they snubbed you. \n\n\nThe other terrible thing that crossed my mind, maybe your fiance doesnt want to marry you and she wants this to be the thing you end things over. Might be worth an ask if she still doesnt tell you why and start backing you up here.", "Info: is it common to give small gifts that often where you're from? Is it like brining over food or are they material gifts? Do they reciprocate that and give gifts too? How long did they know the other plus ones?", "Friend, you got engaged to this woman after less than six months (\"half\" of \"close to a year\"). Six months is, in most cases by far, not long enough to know whether or not you want to dedicate the rest of your life to someone. Maybe you're only now getting to know her true colours? This seems like manipulative and frankly cruel behaviour, on many levels and from several members of her family. Including your fianc\u00e9 herself.\n\nI obviously can't decide for you what to do, and I'm aware that reddit pulls the \"break up\" card at every opportunity... but if it were me, after this betrayal, I would be seriously reconsidering the engagement - or *at the very least* postponing the wedding.  \n\n\nETA: NTA", "You\u2019ve only known your fiancee a year.

My guess is your fianc\u00e9 confides in your sister any arguments or concerns she had about you and is one of those people who exaggerates everything and sister thinks you are a monster.\n\nThere are so many possibilities why her sister did this and I would think it 100 percent necessary to know why because it would possibly change relationship with FSIL, you soon to be wife and the other family. It could also be because you did do something you didn\u2019t realize and in that case you need to know so you can change future behavior.

As in, \"we would like to request the presence of  (name) and (name) to witness  (event)\"\n\nInvite the sister, but not the plus one. See how that plays out.  Right now, you are NOT the asshole for expecting to be treated with civility. But your fiance does need to work on her communication skills.  There is absolutely NO way she didn't know about the others who were already inside. Why else would she be so hesitant about you going inside to express congratulations to all?\n\nJust remember, whatever you do, it will set the stage for all future events with that family.

That she\u2019s just quiet and that\u2019s why she acted weird when you pulled up to the house. I call BS. If they are as close as you say they are, she would know the reason you were the ONLY one not invited. \nSince you seem to see the sister and her family often- ask her. You\u2019re marrying into this family and you deserve to know what the hell that was about.

And if that\u2019s enough to end the engagement, then it was never going to work anyway. \n\nFor some reason, someone doesn\u2019t like you. That\u2019s hurtful and that sucks.

Regardless of your engagement or how much you\u2019ve done for her previously you\u2019ve known her for a very short amount of time and she wanted her wedding to be very small and intimate and it sounds like you haven\u2019t had that time to become part of the family yet. It sucks she couldn\u2019t be honest about it since I think you deserved that courtesy and I understand your feelings are hurt.

I find it VERY hard to believe that your fiancee was completely blindsided by this, because if she was I would think she'd be just as mad as you are about this situation. \n\nShe's showing more concern for her sister's feelings about being excluded from your wedding than she is showing for your feelings for being excluded from hers. That makes me wonder if there's a reason that her family doesn't want you to get married. There could be a ton of reasons for that. Maybe they don't like you. Maybe they think she shouldn't marry you for some reason that you aren't aware of (like maybe they think she doesn't really love you)? There's really no way to know. \n\nI'll tell you this, though. If someone hurts my husband's feelings, they can fuck off. I don't care if that someone is a friend or family. A couple should be a team. Your fiancee doesn't have your back, though.

But I am leaning more into not thinking it through, and it wouldn't surprise me (due to the \"shotgun wedding, for traditional and religiuos reasons\" comment) that fianc\u00e9 wanted to get married fast as well for those same \"reasons\", but the family isn't a big fan of OP (probably due to OP being some sort of \"outsider\", like race, religion or maybe even something as simple as being born in the wrong family), but for reputation's sake it's still better to have OP marry fianc\u00e9.
