We are planning a wedding in the fall of \u201824 and have started a guest list. She comes from a big family and I am an only child. We are close with one of her sisters in particular, and often went to visit her and play board games and such. This sister has a fianc\u00e9 and is pregnant. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this.

Do not allow this to become a discussion focused on her attending that one day.  That is a discussion for months from now and is irrelevant at the moment.  Your problem is with your fianc\u00e9.  She knew you were being excluded and not only kept it from you but doubled down by not coming clean when you asked to go in to congratulate the couple.  Something is very wrong here and you need to have a lot of honest discussions before you decide if there should even be a wedding.  Again DO NOT allow this communication to be sidetracked by a guest list for an event that is over a year away.

You haven't even been together for a year. How well can you really know each other? You are still in the \"best behavior\" stage of your relationship.\n\nYou have just had a peek at what is lurking behind the honeymoon stage of your relationship.\n\nWill she always go along with and side with members of her family over you? Will she go out of her way to avoid standing up for you? She didn't even make up an excuse to spare you by not allowing you to come into the venue. Instead, she let you be humiliated by finding out that you and only you were not invited in FRONT of the rest of the guests.\n\nAlso, did she even push back at her sister when her sister told her you weren't invited? Your fiance had to have know in advance that you were the only one not invited. And from your post, it sounds like she didn't even bother to ask why.\n\nYou may want to slow down on the wedding planning and take some time to really get to know each other before rushing into a marriage.

You didn't deserve to be treated like that. It honestly sounds like you deserve better.", "NTA. Currently you\u2019re in second place to her sister, and maybe even the rest of the family. Pause the engagement and get to the bottom of this NOW before you marry her. There\u2019s something deeper here. You were purposely excluded, and your fianc\u00e9 knew. She\u2019s VERY comfortable keeping you in the dark and lying. Good luck.", "NTA. But I believe your fianc\u00e9 knew and that was all she hesitated.

It says A LOT on how much you mean to them.", "NTA also, you should reconsider the invitation of your fianc\u00e9 to the wedding as in she knew the whole time and didn't tell you and also didn't push for you to be invited to a family affair, you're not a friend or a boyfriend of a few months, you're engaged to her.", "NTA>\n\nSorry, OP, but whatever reason your fianc\u00e9e has for marrying you, it isn't bevcause she loves and supports you. Obviously, she doesn't.\n\nFrom what you say, it is unmistakable that she was in on the decision to bar you from this party, and she not only was happy to do that but then pretended to be confused when you asked what was going on.\n\nAsk yourself what motivation this fianc\u00e9e has for creating a relationship that is on her part totally phony. There is one, without question.\n\nAsk her what the f was going on and do it in such a way that she knows she'll have to be honest with you for once or lose the engagement.

Knew why. And 3. Was totally fine with that.", "NTA \n\nYour fiance knew about *all* this in advance.

If this is what happens before the wedding what happens after?. Is her family gonna keep doing this and is she gonna blame you too?.", "NTA - hold your fiance accountable for this slight, they were knowing participant and deceived you.

That's bad.", "Anyone else notice op said they haven\u2019t even been together a full year yet and they\u2019ve been engaged for half of that\u2026 red flag or is this an arranged thing?", "NTA\n\nWhy would they want it expect to be at yours if you aren't invited to theirs? \n\nAnd yeah. Your fiancee should be getting to the bottom of this and if she's not, walk away.", "NTA, intolerable! Hope their throne of lies is comfy.", "NTA and u should cut down on things u do for them from now on, they don't deserve it and not inviting them to the wedding but just the reception after is the best way to give them the same treatment they gave u.

You need to slow way, way down.", "NTA since you planned the now husbands child\u2019s birthday party and probably paid for it ask him.  Seems like the the sisters aren\u2019t going to spill the beans.  Invite the new husband out and ask what you did that warranted not being invited?  Make sure it\u2019s spontaneous and not a planned outing.  If there\u2019s any time between the ask and the actual meeting he will tell the sister and they will have him give the same lame excuse.  Keep in mind they don\u2019t mind you throwing money at them but don\u2019t want you present at all.  Realize your the ATM or the person to do the things no one else wants to.  For example, being available for the sisters medical emergency, where was her fianc\u00e9, mother, or sister.  Why did you have to plan the new husbands child\u2019s birthday party?  Shouldn\u2019t the sister and the kids father have done it?  \n\nSo many red flags and the literal last straw is not being invited to the wedding.  If you do end up getting married get a prenup, keep finances separate, and don\u2019t be a doormat.  It really looks like your fianc\u00e9 is marrying your wallet not you.", "RUN. Run far and run fast. Your fianc\u00e9e knew you were excluded. It does not matter why.

Do you do and say really awful things when drinking/partying? \n\nIf the answer to all of these questions is no, then NA. \n\nalso, you need to put wedding plans on pause and get a few sessions of couples' therapy. (It'll be better than a divorce, trust me!).\n\nGet to the bottom of this. Do it now, and with a therapist to moderate what will be a very difficult discussion with a lot of hurt and hopefully guilt (on your fianc\u00e9e's side)", "YTA. What they did was crap. But this is still your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister. Her relationship with her own sister is more important than your relationship. I get maybe making boundaries in the future, but not letting your fianc\u00e9 have her sister at the wedding? That\u2019s not ok.", "Soft NTA. This tells you clearly how much the family likes you. You will marry into this and receive years more. Be Damn sure this woman is worth it. She certainly is not going to back you against her family. Not inviting close family members will just confirm their negative opinions about you. Also, you sound a bit controlling.

Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And we even don\u2019t know what their couple dynamics are like. What am i trying to say is don\u2019t be certain about something that you may not know the full picture. If we were to make a answer to the OP it would go like this:\n\u201cIt seems that you may have some trust issues with your fiance and it would be appropriate to bring this to her and discuss the make sure to have a stable and trustfull relationship.\u201d\nBtw i am not totally disagreeing with you. I agree that they need somethings to be solved in their relationship. And i understand why you said these things the way you did. You simply answered based on the information given to you.
