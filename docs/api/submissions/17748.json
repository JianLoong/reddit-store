We are planning a wedding in the fall of \u201824 and have started a guest list. She comes from a big family and I am an only child. We are close with one of her sisters in particular, and often went to visit her and play board games and such. This sister has a fianc\u00e9 and is pregnant. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this.

Do not allow this to become a discussion focused on her attending that one day.  That is a discussion for months from now and is irrelevant at the moment.  Your problem is with your fianc\u00e9.  She knew you were being excluded and not only kept it from you but doubled down by not coming clean when you asked to go in to congratulate the couple.  Something is very wrong here and you need to have a lot of honest discussions before you decide if there should even be a wedding.

Will she go out of her way to avoid standing up for you? She didn't even make up an excuse to spare you by not allowing you to come into the venue. Instead, she let you be humiliated by finding out that you and only you were not invited in FRONT of the rest of the guests.\n\nAlso, did she even push back at her sister when her sister told her you weren't invited? Your fiance had to have know in advance that you were the only one not invited. And from your post, it sounds like she didn't even bother to ask why.\n\nYou may want to slow down on the wedding planning and take some time to really get to know each other before rushing into a marriage.

You didn't deserve to be treated like that. It honestly sounds like you deserve better.", "NTA. Currently you\u2019re in second place to her sister, and maybe even the rest of the family. Pause the engagement and get to the bottom of this NOW before you marry her. There\u2019s something deeper here. You were purposely excluded, and your fianc\u00e9 knew. She\u2019s VERY comfortable keeping you in the dark and lying. Good luck.", "NTA. But I believe your fianc\u00e9 knew and that was all she hesitated.

It says A LOT on how much you mean to them.", "NTA also, you should reconsider the invitation of your fianc\u00e9 to the wedding as in she knew the whole time and didn't tell you and also didn't push for you to be invited to a family affair, you're not a friend or a boyfriend of a few months, you're engaged to her.", "NTA>\n\nSorry, OP, but whatever reason your fianc\u00e9e has for marrying you, it isn't bevcause she loves and supports you. Obviously, she doesn't.\n\nFrom what you say, it is unmistakable that she was in on the decision to bar you from this party, and she not only was happy to do that but then pretended to be confused when you asked what was going on.\n\nAsk yourself what motivation this fianc\u00e9e has for creating a relationship that is on her part totally phony.

Make sure it\u2019s spontaneous and not a planned outing.  If there\u2019s any time between the ask and the actual meeting he will tell the sister and they will have him give the same lame excuse.  Keep in mind they don\u2019t mind you throwing money at them but don\u2019t want you present at all.  Realize your the ATM or the person to do the things no one else wants to.  For example, being available for the sisters medical emergency, where was her fianc\u00e9, mother, or sister.  Why did you have to plan the new husbands child\u2019s birthday party?

You will marry into this and receive years more. Be Damn sure this woman is worth it. She certainly is not going to back you against her family. Not inviting close family members will just confirm their negative opinions about you. Also, you sound a bit controlling.

We are planning a wedding in the fall of \u201824 and have started a guest list. She comes from a big family and I am an only child. We are close with one of her sisters in particular, and often went to visit her and play board games and such. This sister has a fianc\u00e9 and is pregnant. Recently, my fianc\u00e9 told me that her sister was having a shotgun wedding before the baby arrived in order to keep with their traditional values and appease familial religious desires.\n\nBack up a bit. I\u2019ve done a lot for her sister and soon-to-be husband. I planned a birthday party for his son-from-another-marriage, I\u2019ve given her rides, always brought small gifts when I would visit. I\u2019ve gone as far as to stop everything I was doing to help her during a health scare while she was pregnant. I really felt like a part of the family. Fast forward.\n\nIn a text to my fianc\u00e9 upon announcing her wedding, her sister made it a point to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a small wedding, no plus ones. OP can come to the dinner afterwards.\u201d All fine by me. I honestly don\u2019t really mind, as ceremonies can be dull and I understood why she would only want to have immediate family at her small wedding.\n\nI woke up on the day of the wedding to help my fianc\u00e9 get ready and drive her over to her sisters house. I planned on driving my fianc\u00e9, her sister, and her sisters soon-to-be husband to the venue and bringing them to the dinner afterwards. My fianc\u00e9 told me, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just drop me off at my sisters and we will get a ride over.\u201d \n\nA little odd, but I was fine with that too. I arrived over there and as my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car I asked if I could come in and congratulate them. She seemed hesitant and said, \u201cUhh, ok. Let me just text my sister to make sure.\u201d\n\nI was dressed in plainclothes, and was hesitantly invited to come inside. We walked up to the house.\n\nInside was a party of her siblings, and their friends and significant others all dressed up. They all looked at me and didn\u2019t say much. I saw another one of her sisters, and her new boyfriend was in a suit. Everyone was invited. The \u201cno plus 1\u2019s\u201d only applied to me.\n\nI immediately left, and in a text told my fianc\u00e9 they were off the guest list for our wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is upset at that, because her sister is her close friend. She said maybe I did something to upset them which is why I wasn\u2019t invited, but I\u2019ve been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars and gone above and beyond for everyone. Now we are fighting over this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What was it?", "NTA but I would ask your fianc\u00e9 sister why you weren\u2019t invited. I mean, of course it was an AH move not inviting just you, but if you used to be close there must be a reason to this.", "I think you might be blaming the wrong party here. If your fiance is OK with her sister excluding you like this then you should be rethinking your relationship dynamics.", "NTA. I wouldnt invite them either and I would stop helping them. I bet she will have a shocked Pikachu face when she realizes that you won\u2019t help her anymore.", "NTA\n\nas others have said, your problem is not the guest list for a party a year from now, your problem is that you are rushing into marriage with someone you clearly don't know enough about.

Don't get married until you figure this out.", "NTA - BUT, your fianc\u00e9 is definitely an asshole. She obviously knew this all along and kept it from you.

Do you really wanna marry someone like this? Yall should be a team, and to tell you \"maybe you did something to upset them\" is just out of pocket. Sounds like she has her sisters back over anyone. And that isn't good for a relationship.", "OP, NTA for this situation.\n\n\nBut you will be if you marry this woman.  She does not have your back.  She is not your partner.\n\nAnd worst of all - she lies to you.  Why would you want that in your life?  She showed you who she really is.  Believe that truth.  Let the trash take itself out.

You need to find out before things go any further.", "Don't gloss over the comments, everyone is on point, you're focused on the wrong thing. I've been there, you just want someone to love you so bad that you overlook all the lying, gaslighting and red flags that they throw at you.

I had an ex who talked shit behind my back any chance he got and the fact that she didn't back you up and purposely being sneaky let's me know she probably does the same thing.

Plenty of bad behavior on the part of your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family, but to text your fianc\u00e9e to tell her that her sister can\u2019t come to your wedding is a very poor way to be starting a marriage. It\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s wedding too, and decisions should be made jointly. \n\nIt would be much more respectful to talk to your fianc\u00e9e face-to-face and tell her how you feel. Also, if you truly believe that you have been nothing but kind and caring to her entire family, then you may have been thoughtless or inconsiderate with realizing it. Be prepared to listen to another point of view on how you have offended them. \n\nIf you are intent on uninviting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister against your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s will, you might reconsider your wedding.", "I also get some vibes here concerning wedding pictures. Like, they don't want OP in the pics. Possibly because he's not going to be in the family after all????", "NTA for your reaction, AND you have a serious problem with your fianc\u00e9e. She knew you weren\u2019t invited to the wedding and kept it from you - disrespectful. What do you get out of this relationship?", "NTA and your fiance is gaslighting you HARD.

This doesn't make sense to me why the sister and her new husband would do something like that. You've done a lot for them, and they purposely excluded you.

Every time I see one of these stories on Reddit where someone is excluded, it's racism or something similar. \n\nI'm just thinking that your fiance's family either disapproves of your relationship or is embarrassed by you in some way. More info is needed to determine whether their dislike is legitimate.", "NTA. Watson, the game is afoot. I agree with others that something went on behind OP\u2019s back.

And I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going far enough with simply uninviting these people from your wedding. Your fianc\u00e9e was clearly aware this was happening and was complicit in both excluding you AND lying to you about it. And her only response is a weak excuse about how you maybe inadvertently angered someone? \nYour fianc\u00e9e and her family are using you, treating you like garbage, and lying to you like you\u2019re an idiot. I strongly recommend you find a new partner who respects and appreciates you.", "NTA\n\nBut engaged at six months and only known each other less than a year? This is moving way too fast. \n\nI\u2019d easily dump somebody when they and their entire family made me second class and not a full member. But if you decide to stay, and I hope you don\u2019t, you need to postpone the wedding. \n\nDo you really want to sign on to a lifetime of this? They\u2019re just using and taking advantage of you. It\u2019s all so dysfunctional and toxic. \n\nWhen a relationship is rushed, it glosses over the red flags. Makes me wonder if your fianc\u00e9 rushed things, to get you invested before you see the ugly side. \n\nThis is who all of them are. You won\u2019t be able to change this. Better to leave and find someone who is kind and has a kind family who welcomes you. \n\nDon\u2019t stay. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. Sometimes bad experiences are blessings in disguise. Yes you got rejected, but you also got the gift of being shown exactly why you need to leave your fianc\u00e9 before things progress.

Your future wife lied to your face about it being no plus one's and then blamed you, and doesn't have your back on this. She will probably always choose her sister, or even her extended family, over you. You will probably never be considered \"part\" of her family if this is the case.\n\nI would question if she's at all worth marrying.\n\nNTA", "Nta, you've done a lot for the sister, could her husband be jealous or insecure and it's coming from him?

Otherwise her family events in future will be very awkward. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe her sister who you\u2019ve done so much for is banning you from her wedding and there is no bad blood or history between you two.

Six months is, in most cases by far, not long enough to know whether or not you want to dedicate the rest of your life to someone. Maybe you're only now getting to know her true colours?

Tacky, yes.\n\nI always thought that spouses and long-term relationships were always included in the original invite.  As in, \"we would like to request the presence of  (name) and (name) to witness  (event)\"\n\nInvite the sister, but not the plus one. See how that plays out.  Right now, you are NOT the asshole for expecting to be treated with civility. But your fiance does need to work on her communication skills.  There is absolutely NO way she didn't know about the others who were already inside. Why else would she be so hesitant about you going inside to express congratulations to all?\n\nJust remember, whatever you do, it will set the stage for all future events with that family.

That makes me wonder if there's a reason that her family doesn't want you to get married. There could be a ton of reasons for that. Maybe they don't like you. Maybe they think she shouldn't marry you for some reason that you aren't aware of (like maybe they think she doesn't really love you)? There's really no way to know. \n\nI'll tell you this, though.

They don\u2019t want you there. You are unwelomed in this family. Are you ready for a lifetime of this with a woman who enables it?", "NTA. Most importantly, you are not married yet you got lucky my friend.", "NTA but you do realise you have been played by your fianc\u00e9e? Obviously she knew you were excluded. Not only did she not speak for you, she actually said you might be at fault for not being invited to her sister's wedding.\nIn your shoes, I will take this as a wake up call and think long and hard about whom I am marrying and the family I am marrying into.\nGood luck.", "NTA .. for this.\n\nI am VERY curious about the justification you will hear from your fiance and her family for excluding you\nI cannot think of one.. but..if you did something egregious...??? Would you tell us..? Or do you even know?\n\nEither way. The relationship problem here isn't you and the sister... it's you and your fiance.", "No man, she did know. That\u2019s why she said she needed to text to make sure it was ok for you to come in and wish them well and also that they didn\u2019t need you to drive after all. I\u2019m so sorry dude, but that family is going to be a toxic future for you. You seem way too good and nice for that group.", "I don\u2019t buy that. I find it hard to believe she didn\u2019t know about everyone else being invited when it\u2019s her sister\u2019s wedding. I think she knows why they didn\u2019t want to invite you as well. Plus, look at the way she treated you, didn\u2019t have your back and said \u201cmaybe it was something you did?\u201d, really?! A loving spouse would stick up for you, especially after all the sacrifices you\u2019ve said you done for them. I would seriously reevaluate marrying her and into that family. A high value guy would stand for this. The amount of disrespect not only she displayed, but her whole family did to you is unreal.", ">Additional info here. I\u2019m quite sure my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know that others were being invited. She just seemed conflicted and surprised when we arrived\n\nI'm sorry OP but no. She didn't want you to drive her to the venue, she acted reluctant to even have you come inside, made a big deal about having to call her sister to make sure that you could come into the house simply to offer congratulations... She knew and she kept it from you.   \n\n\nYou deserve answers and I'd be seriously reconsidering this relationship if I were you because it seems to me, and pretty much everyone else here, that your fiance and her family have absolutely no issue with not only excluding you from big family events but also lying to you. That is not okay.", "> I\u2019m quite sure my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know that others were being invited.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so certain of that if I were you. Her behavior on the day leading up to the drop off makes no sense unless she knew you were being excluded and wanted to avoid you finding out. Why would she be nervous about you going in if she didn\u2019t know something was up? Why was she in such a hurry to get you out of there if she didn\u2019t know something was up? It seems clear she had at least SOME knowledge of the situation.", "She should\u2019ve stick up for you. Do not make excuses for her!  You were disrespected by that family!  The whole lot of them.", "She could have at least communicated with him about the issue", "If my significant other was not invited to a family get together I would want to know why.  The fact that she called to see if it was okay to let\u2019s me know she knew before hand what was up.  If anyone doesn\u2019t think she didn\u2019t know why, I think you are being naive.   \n\nThis would prompt a very deep conversation with me as to whether your future spouse will have your back in the future.  \n\nWhen you get married, you make a family for yourself and your spouse.  I get that your \u201cold\u201d family doesn\u2019t disappear, but they should be a secondary consideration to your spouse and (future) children.  This lady didn\u2019t do that now.   Why would she in the future?", "OP, this makes no sense. It\u2019s clear from her hesitation when you asked to go inside that she knew you were being excluded.\n\nThe excuse she gave you just isn\u2019t logical. Stop for a moment, set your emotions aside, and play this actual scene in your head. The way she described it isn\u2019t believable at all.\n\nFianc\u00e9e and SIL having general wedding chatter:\n\nSIL: \u201cBy the way, there\u2019s something I need to talk to you about. AgentRamandu won\u2019t be able to come to my wedding.\u201d\n\nFianc\u00e9e: \u201cOh, are you not allowing guests to bring plus ones?\u201d\n\nSIL: \u201cWell\u2026see, here\u2019s the thing, guests can bring plus ones, but not you because we don\u2019t want AgentRamadu at the wedding.\u201d\n\nFianc\u00e9e:  \u201cOh\u2026umm\u2026ok, I guess.\u201d **<\u2014\u2014 This does not make any sense.**\n\nOR\n\nFianc\u00e9e: \u201cWhat? Why does everyone get to bring a plus one except me? What possible reason would you have to not want AgentRamandu at your wedding? He\u2019s my fianc\u00e9 and we\u2019re all close friends. At the very least I would like an explanation why he can\u2019t come.\u201d  **<\u2014\u2014 THIS is a reasonable, logical response.**\n\nAt best she\u2019s not standing up for you, and at worst she\u2019s in on it for whatever reason.\n\nThink carefully about how your fianc\u00e9e is handling this, and what it might mean for your future lives together.", "Your problem is not her sister. Your problem is your fiance.\n\nShe was OK having you excluded. She was OK keeping that a secret from you. She's not OK with you being unhappy about it. She's OK with lying to you about the whole process.\n\nYou need to rethink your relationship. She doesn't value your emotional well-being or happiness \u2014 the functional cornerstone of any healthy relationship.", "That's from r/nosleep though.\n\nIt's a fictional story in first person.", "Good questions. I want to know, too", "When I got married one of my friends was a groomsman in my wedding party. He had only been dating his new girlfriend for a few months and didn\u2019t want to attend the wedding solo since my wife and I would be the only ones he knew. My wedding was the first time I ever met his new girlfriend. I didn\u2019t care, I just wanted everyone to feel comfortable and celebrate the day with my wife and myself. \n\nWhen my wife and I were dating she would drag me to all her family get togethers and they had a TON of get togethers. I went along with it, did not complain because I figured it was a good way to get to know everyone anyways. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe you tried to integrate yourself into your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family too quickly. You were trying too hard to impress them that you made some of them uncomfortable. Maybe they want you and your fianc\u00e9 to break up because of how quickly you went from dating to engagement and your fianc\u00e9 is not admitting this to you because she lacks the courage to do so?", "Why was another +1 boyfriend, who was only a before for 6 months invited? Did they know him better somehow?", "Ok so I\u2019ve only ever had one situation where myself and a whole bunch of people left one person out because we were totally over him, being with him is exhausting and we\u2019ve had to include him because he has no friends and we know why. \n\nNot saying that this is you OP, but maybe possible.\n\nThis person is a nice person, overly generous, but does not know how to read the room or stay within boundaries. Totally oblivious to social cues and intentionally riles people up with extreme opinions. We all suspect he is on the spectrum but not obvious enough so we also assume he\u2019s an asshole hiding behind a nice guy demeanor. \n\nSome examples:\n- criticizes people for the life choices and acts as a social warriors when he himself is a white man with extensive privileges\n- mansplains but we can\u2019t tell him off because he tries to do it \u201cfor the cause\u201d\n- says random bigoted opinions to catch people if they are more conflicted in their views so he can turn around and say he\u2019s joking but now he knows who\u2019s the bigot, but you can\u2019t hate him because you\u2019re the bigot (that he trapped you into saying something)\n- he exhausts you, then ask you fall walks to talk, he says all the right things but something is off like he doesn\u2019t believe it but you can\u2019t call him out, I\u2019ve managed to catch him out a few times and when I mentioned it to friends they had a whole \u201cah ha\u201d moment, like he\u2019s pretending to be pc, because that\u2019s how he can make friends, but it\u2019s not authentic.\n- he tries to catch me for a private conversation at 7am in the morning in person, I said I need to have a shower and I\u2019m not awake (hint leave me alone I\u2019m not a morning person), after the shower he asks \u201chow was the shower?\u201d Like WTF?\n- he went all anti violence on another friend of our who carries a hidden weapon because she lives in an unsafe neighborhood because that\u2019s all she can afford and she\u2019s been followed and verbally abused by people who hate her for her identity and sexuality.\n\n\nHe has this \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy, I say nice things, I do nice things for you, I\u2019ll get hurt\u201d. That myself and our group has not been able to say to him: \u201clook, you do and say shit all the time that pushes people\u2019s boundaries, they can\u2019t relax around you because you trap them in you social warrior campaign when you yourself don\u2019t even understand or have the lived experience to opinionate accurately\u201d\n\nWe are no longer in his immediate vicinity and our group has been traveling extensively separately for a while that we\u2019ve decided not to tell him.", "Sorry OP but this is complete BS. Please stand up for yourself.", "Sorry a quick congrats before the ceremony is a nice courtesy.  Especially considering this was in a house.  OP went above and beyond prior and during and being nice with a congrats is the cherry on top", "Remind me! 2 days", "The OP is obviously insinuating that the fianc\u00e9e knew beginning with the idea that the fianc\u00e9e refused an offer for him to drive to the venue, but I don't get that.\n\nIt would be odd if they didn't already have a plan for getting to the venue. Nobody relies on someone not invited to the ceremony for a ride to their own wedding without arranging it before hand.\n\nThat leaves her leaves her being hesitant once they arrive. But that's not strange, either. It's weird and awkward to have someone who didn't make the cut for a \"small ceremony\" to invite themselves in during the prep and then have to leave.\n\nSure, she might have known in advance, but I don't think this is a basis for assuming that.", "Or maybe they\u2019re lying about being a fianc\u00e9 at all", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. This is absolutely a betrayal! You fianc\u00e9 does know and either doesn\u2019t want to tell you because she is too ashamed by it, in which case she doesn\u2019t have your back and you should be worried about marrying her or she is part of the reason in which case you should not be marrying her.\nThis is not normal and you should not accept it. Find yourself a partner who is actually interested in a partnership. Someone who has your back and will stick up for you and wants you to be part of all lifes events. The foundations of this relationship are terrible. NTA at all. Not only should she not be invited but you really need to know what happened here to decide if you should go ahead with your wedding at all.", "According to his comment history, Dec 2021, he was engaged. I really hope it's the same person and he's just really bad at math. However, I have a feeling this fiancee is not the same one.", "Less than. They haven't even been together a full year.", "This what I came here to say. I'm 90% certain that your relationship is over and she just hasn't decided how and when to say it to you. At the least she's trying to get some space from OP.", "> He was an ass for proposing.\n\nThat isn't how this works. OP was naive, that doesn't make him an asshole.", "In before this was all fiances idea because she actually wants to break up or something which all the guests knew so they accepted this cruel treatment of OP\n\nI just get that VIBE. Its so common. Someone wants to break up but is too chicken to do it or wants something out of the relationship so they just make excuses why their partner can't go to things with them", "Not an asshole, but a bit of a horse's ass.", "NTA. This hurt my feelings.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding is more than a year away.   Your current reaction is entirely understandable, and valid.   Your fianc\u00e9's reaction is NOT understandable.\n\nYou need to get some couples counselling with your fianc\u00e9 during that time.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should have walked out that door with you.   Her not wanting to make a scene does not excuse her allowing you to be treated that way.\n\nYou also need an explanation and an apology from the bride and groom.", "NTA \n\nI have the best solution: cancel the wedding. This family is toxic.", "Even worse, *she didn't even know why OP was excluded!!!*\n\nLiterally a \"Maybe you offended them\" is all he gets?!?! This is fucking insane behavior from fiance no matter how attached they are to their sister.", "I wanted to ask this too. Not even together a year and engaged for half that?? They hardly know each other!! Seems like they are all religious though so....", "Yes, I need to know. That\u2019s so messed up for them to do that. OP is definitely NTA.", "I\u2019m quite sure she did.", "Same here. I honestly had a fear of OP's fianc\u00e9 cheating on him and being there with her other boyfriend or the other way around, her being there with her actual partner and him finding out he's the other guy.\nI'm thankful that didn't happen but it's weird and Op's NTA", "THANK YOU. I feel like nobody's really addressing that.", "Yeah my mind went that way as well. Because if they don't want him at the ceremony, but he is allowed to attend the dinner afterwards, that suggests to me that they're probably trying to avoid him appearing in wedding photos. Otherwise, it's not really clear *why* they'd go out of their way to keep him specifically out of the wedding.", "Okay bet. \n\nHer sister isn\u2019t invited to the wedding. You don\u2019t wanna answer questions about it. \n\nIf she can just refuse you, you can too.", "Hate to break it to you she knows and/or doesn\u2019t have your back. Not good options either way. You should really rethink this wedding before you get too deep", "Same! I hope OP gets some answers soon, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated so disrespectfully, especially by people in his own fianc\u00e9s close family:(", "The kind that gets engaged after dating 6 months?", "Fianc\u00e9\u2019s have always been considered equal to a spouse when it comes to invitations.
