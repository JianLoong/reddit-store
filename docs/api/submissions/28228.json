I wouldn't have understood what he wanted either.  The night wasn't over for everyone because he had to go home.  He created the plate of shit and now he's got to deal with it without making it anyone else's problem.", "NTA\n\nLife didn\u2019t hand him a shit plate, he made a dangerous, illegal choice and got caught.\n\nAnd even if it truely was something that was no fault of his own, expecting other people to abandon a dinner because he had to leave due to what amounts to his own scheduling conflict is incredibly entitled.", "NTA. Your brother served himself a heaping plate of shit with his DWI. That's his issue, as are the consequences, which could have been so much worse. You aren't required to live your life according to the consequences of your brother's actions. He hasn't learned that lesson clearly.", "NTA, not in any way at all!!  \nIt seems that your brother continues to make poor decisions. Why should everyone leave because of his restrictions? Not sure what you were supposed to comment ... maybe \"Gee, sucks that you were caught DWI. Good luck.\"", "NTA. Mom should be telling brother to apologize.", "NTA. If I were him I'd be so embarrassed I'd probably skip family dinner. And I would never expect everyone to leave with me. \n\nMy wife and I have 3 kids under 8, we both work long hours as well. If we get a sitter you'd better believe we are getting apps, a cocktail, dinner, dessert and maybe a 2nd cocktail. And not leaving until we are good and ready. \n\nI think he owes you an apology, but wouldn't expect one.", "Nta", "NTA. I\u2019m not really sure what they were expecting. Did they want some sort of pity party or something? Do they think you\u2019re not allowed to be alone with your parents? That because *they* have to be home at 8, everyone else does? All those things seem pretty self centered and selfish in all honesty. Then to harp on it & double team you through texts for days afterwards is just immature. Instead of asking you to apologize, how about your mom asks them to grow up. If keeping the peace in necessary over this nonsense then give them a very nice non-apology.", "NTA and don\u2019t feel bad for him. He could have killed someone by driving drunk!!!", "Do not apologize to \"keep the peace.\" You are correct that he is dealing with true consequences and he needs to put his big boy pants on and deal with it.\n\nHow many times has the family had to sooth ruffled feather in the name of \"keeping the peace\"? STOP IT! The only thing is does is make people think they can get away with bad behavior and poor decision making skills.\n\nNTA. I hope you stayed for desert!", "There seems to be a breakdown of communication.  I am not sure why your brother was so but hurt.  Did he want the dinner moved to his location?  Or just some sympathy. You are not responsible for his plight. However, as an adult who is also his sister, you are not justified in stating what he, also as an adult, should already know.  He made a bad choice, but you are not obliged to remind him of this.  It's kind of like being tried twice for the same offense.  Insult to injury.  Kind of like telling a homeless person to just get a job, or a morbidly obese person to just try ordering a salad. Most things in life are not so cut and dry. Most problems are more complex.\n\nNo one is perfect, and if they claim to be, then watch out!  \n\nWe all just need to try and be more understanding and accepting of all the good bad and ugly in all of us.", "Huh sounds like my uncle", "NTA tell your mother she needs to ask her beloved son to apology to you too for keep the peace.", "NTA. Your brother wanted everyone to leave when he did? He sounds very entitled and immature. You are not crazy.", "NTA he doesn't need your permission to leave the table and steakhouses aren't airports no ones departure needs to be announced.\n\nI'd book every function from 7:30 pm from now on.", "Life didn't hand him a DUI, he did that through a LENGTHY SERIES of poor decisions. And it's also almost certainly not the first time he did it, just the first time he got caught. He's incredibly fortunate that he's not in prison, and didn't lose his job and home. He should be ridiculously grateful that he a) didn't kill anyone because of his idiocy, and b) he's not doing lengthy prison time for this. \n\nHe should be ashamed of what he did, but it looks like he still feels entitled and angry that there are consequences. He was spared the trauma of murder and prison and he has the temerity to get angry about that?! And ask for sympathy?! Fuck that noise. He deserves what he got and more. \n\nNTA", "You should tell him you have .08 sympathy for his situation.", "He's getting his deserved karma", "[removed]", "From one bratty little sister to another, NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThe world does not revolve around him. Just because he has other \"priorities\" doesn't mean people need to stop their fun because he's no longer around.", "NTA I don't understand your brother or why he targeted you? It just makes no sense to me. You had nothing to do with anything.\n\nYour parents made the reservation early, you all were in the middle of dinner, then he abruptly needs to leave, then starts going off on you and only you for not being compassionate and called your selfish for not cutting dinner short. Your brother is off his rocker. He is selfish and rude if he expects everyone to leave IN THE MIDDLE OF DINNER because he made bad choices.\n\nIn no world are you an AH. You're just on the receiving end of your brothers anger at his own poor choices. He has targeted you to let out all his frustrations. He is too emotionally stunted to admit he is the reason shit is not going well for him.\nDon't apologize at all. Don't listen to the keep the peace bull crap. Your brother will just learn to keep taking his anger out on everyone else. He will continue to blame everyone instead of accepting that he is responsible for his actions. If anything, he needs to apologize to you.\nYou attended a dinner you folks organised and essentially were a guest. He had no right to go off on you.", "NTA. Your BIL has a curfew. You don't.", "NTA but I find it extremely weird he has to take a breathalyzer test in his own home at certain times. I've never even heard of that.", "NTA\n\nDoes or did your brother bend over backwards to help you cope with the joyous trauma of triplets?  And this is usually one of life's lottery tickets and not something you chose.", "NTA", "NTA, why isn\u2019t he getting mad at your parents for staying too? Also no sympathy for him honestly, drunk drivers get none from me.", "He got mad at you... one person out of the 4 people who stayed behind. \n\nNTA", "Life didn\u2019t hand him a plate of shit. He ordered the shit and now he\u2019s complaining that he has to eat it. Boo fucking hoo. NTA.", "NTA; also not a shock that someone so self-absorbed to get a DWI would think the world should stop bc he has to do something. Tell your mother you are NOT going to apologize and maybe if your parents didn\u2019t cower to your self-absorbed brother\u2019s unreasonable demands he would have learned the sun does not rise and set on his say so.  \n\nHis behavior is absolutely appalling.", "NTA!  \nI really do hate the \"apologize (even though you did nothing wrong) to keep the peace\"  \nSounds to my ears like \"eat shit so we can all pretend bro did nothing wrong\"  \nYou did the right thing! Kid free nights are rare and you deserve to enjoy the whole night with no 7pm curfew.", "NTA, experience shows alcoholic people tend to be aggressive, specially when they are frustration with alcohol, of course you could have say something like, it was nice to see you, thank-you for coming even for a short period. But looks like you were surprised he had to leave suddenly, and of course it was ok for you to stay. Hope you can find nice words like, I understand it\u2019s difficult but it is for the safety of people, kids, family on the road and when probation is over, hope you won\u2019t get back to drinking and driving. It\u2019s hard to deal with alcoholism, your brother need love and need to learn healthy way to vent and express frustration.", "NTA. I can't even see why they are mad at you. No normal person would expect that they should leave too, in those circumstances. I hate this \"asked to apologise although I did nothing wrong\" bullshit. Tell your mother you have nothing to apologise for. God, it infuriates me! Pander to the bully/sook/ignoramus? No.", "NTA karma is wonderful sometimes\n\n&#x200B;\n\npeace keeping means once again enabling btw. that is a him problem start to finish. if i was your sil i would be so embarrassed by his behaviour", "You brother is, indeed, experiencing the consequences of a DUI, and offense that could have resulted in his death or the deaths of others.  \n\nAnd he thinks that the rest of the family should feel a bunch of empathy for someone who got behind the wheel of a vehicle drunk, and that the family should join him in suffering the consequences by cutting short an extended family dinner.\n\nAnd why, pray tell, should you do that?  Because, simply put, life didn't hand your brother a plate of shit.  Your brother created his shit situation by breaking the law in a way that endangered himself and others.

His irresponsibility, not your irresponsibility.\n\nNTA", "An impaired driver hit and killed my husband almost 2 years ago. They, naturally, didn\u2019t even get a boo boo.

You earned the life you enjoy. \nAnd he earned his", "NTA also he could have gone and come back AFTER it would take about 50 minutes.", "NTA.  I hate when people suggest apologies even when they also agree no wrongdoing occurred.
