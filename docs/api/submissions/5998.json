She didn't like that answer.\n\nShe said she paid my son the day prior to shovel her driveway for three days. This sounded unlikely to me. My son usually doesn't like to commit to things in advance like that. I told her she could come back and talk to him when he was awake. She asked me to wake him up, but I said no, because he's on vacation, so why should he have to wake up early if he doesn't want to. The woman was mad and wanted her $15 back. I told her to come back later and ask my son and just shut the door.\n\nShe came back at nine AM, and when my son talked to her he said he never agreed to shovel her driveway multiple days, but that he would do it again for another $15. She was furious and said the price of shoveling a driveway is $5 and she already gave him $15 so he either needed to give her $10 or come shovel her driveway. He said no, he wouldn't shovel a driveway for $5, that's why he told her it was fifteen. If she didn't want to pay fifteen, she should have declined the offer.\n\nShe told me to make my son give her $10, and I said no. I said they had a business arrangement, and it didn't involve me, so I don't care how they resolve it. She said I should shovel her driveway then, and I said no, because she woke me up and I have insomnia, and I don't appreciate that. Normally I'd shovel a female neighbor's driveway if she asked and I have time, because I know it can be difficult, but I wasn't inclined to feel charitable towards her at that moment. She asked if I cared at all about the bad spot my son put her in, and I said I didn't, because he can charge whatever he likes for a service, and if she doesn't want to pay, that's not my problem.\n\nShe said I am an asshole raising an even bigger asshole, and then she left.

If they have two driveways (both of our houses had 2 driveways when I was growing up), add some amount for the extra one.

That sounded to me and I don\u2019t live in a place where it snows.", "(edit: I see he did speak to her. I suggest let him handle it. Stay out of it for now). not an a$$ but you cannot speak for your son. Let him talk to her. He will learn diplomacy and tact.

So the real reason I wouldn't help her was because I was mad at her for waking me up. Otherwise I definitely would have shoveled her driveway.

I remember shoveling a driveway being about a $5 chore when was his age, but inflation is no joke, so I think his price was reasonable.", "He could have, but in this case it might not have helped. He said \"it's $15\" and she somehow understood that as three days at $5 each. How does that leap even happen? If she is so delusional to determine his own price, then who says she wouldn't just try to twist whatever a flyer said?", "In all fairness, he didn't say he offered to shovel their driveways for them, just that he would help if *they asked (nicely, presumably, unlike this harpy)*. Also, he used the word female twice, both as an adjective, both times before *neighbour.* It would be a little clunky to say 'woman neighbour.' Never 'females' as a noun or generalization. I understand the sentiment, but it's misplaced.", "Why would his son have to apologize? He gave the lady a price, she ignored it and basically tried to rip him off. This lady does not deserve an apology. Also I wouldn't call that defending his son, just trying to fend off an entitled ass way too early in the morning.", "No, that would teach exactly the wrong thing. When a customer gets abusive, they should not get coddled. That's what had devil's the entitled idiots we have all seen. There is no way anyone gets a driveway shipped for 5 dollars. This isn't 1970. If the others payed 15, and somehow she just decided that she deserves more, that's on her.", "This I exactly what he did. The lady came back later when the son was awake and spoke directly to him.\n\n>I would suggest he go to her house, apologize and trust that he will do the right thing.\n\nThis is not teaching him diplomacy and tact, this is teaching him to not stand up for himself and letting adults bully him.", "Well. Yeah. Why wouldn't you be pissed at her waking you up. She did it for no reason. She didn't ask nicely. She tried to rip your kid off. Then she asked you for money and demanded free labour out of you.\n\nIf she was there the first time *before* 9 am. What time did she first arrive? Any earlier than 8 and I would have hit her with a snowball. Okay maybe not but I would have been tempted.", "After what she said, you'd have been an AH if you shoveled her driveway or made your son do it. This would teach him that others can trample all over him. Which would be bad parenting. Your son is already more than nice enough to offer shoveling for 15. That's healthy.", "Inflation plus it's his choice for which price to offer it. She didn't have to accept.  In general I think you are completely reasonable. \n\nYour son being 13, i understand she wanted to talk to you. He is minor and you're the guardian. In this situation the referral to solve it with him might have been ok, but maybe in more complex situations he will need your support.", "That's true.

Kid was maybe 9 years old, our driveway is large enough to park more than half a dozen cars, but Dad agreed to the arrangement. After shutting the front door he laughed, knew the kid wouldn\u2019t be able to do a very good job simply because of the size of the undertaking, but wanted to encourage his initiative so would absolutely pay him regardless of how mediocre a job he did. Not too long after, we hear a noise. The kid\u2019s dad was clearing off the driveway with a snow blower. \n\nTurns out he heard his dad saying he planned to clear our driveway and ran over secure promise of payment before his own dad could show up. All that being said, my dad still paid him $5 for clearing the 20 foot walk from the front door to the driveway as it\u2019s textured stone and difficult to clear.
