I think he made like $75. Well yesterday morning I woke up to someone knocking on my door and was very irritated. When I opened the door a woman was standing there asking when my son was going to come shovel her driveway. I told her I doubted he wanted to get up early two days in a row, so he probably wasn't. She didn't like that answer.\n\nShe said she paid my son the day prior to shovel her driveway for three days. This sounded unlikely to me. My son usually doesn't like to commit to things in advance like that. I told her she could come back and talk to him when he was awake. She asked me to wake him up, but I said no, because he's on vacation, so why should he have to wake up early if he doesn't want to. The woman was mad and wanted her $15 back. I told her to come back later and ask my son and just shut the door.\n\nShe came back at nine AM, and when my son talked to her he said he never agreed to shovel her driveway multiple days, but that he would do it again for another $15. She was furious and said the price of shoveling a driveway is $5 and she already gave him $15 so he either needed to give her $10 or come shovel her driveway. He said no, he wouldn't shovel a driveway for $5, that's why he told her it was fifteen. If she didn't want to pay fifteen, she should have declined the offer.\n\nShe told me to make my son give her $10, and I said no. I said they had a business arrangement, and it didn't involve me, so I don't care how they resolve it. She said I should shovel her driveway then, and I said no, because she woke me up and I have insomnia, and I don't appreciate that. Normally I'd shovel a female neighbor's driveway if she asked and I have time, because I know it can be difficult, but I wasn't inclined to feel charitable towards her at that moment. She asked if I cared at all about the bad spot my son put her in, and I said I didn't, because he can charge whatever he likes for a service, and if she doesn't want to pay, that's not my problem.\n\nShe said I am an asshole raising an even bigger asshole, and then she left. I know I wasn't neighborly, but I don't feel like it rises to the level of asshole, because I think she was entitled. But maybe I should have been more empathetic.

She was definitely taking advantage of him and trying to milk it for all it was worth. You and kid handled it well. What I suggest for the future is for your son to hand out flyers for snow shoveling. Put everything in writing, then people can't dispute it. Clearly state it's a one-time service for this price. If they have two driveways (both of our houses had 2 driveways when I was growing up), add some amount for the extra one. When he has any takers, have him write down in his phone or a small notepad whose driveway he's going to shovel, what day, and the time. Help him set his hours and manage breaks for food and pee.

Just so you know, it might be a hassle, but women are just as capable of shoveling their driveways as men are. The difference isn't that big and we are not made of sugar.\n\nShe was trying to pressure you into giving her something she was absolutely not entitled to. Don't waste any more thoughts on her and please stop calling women 'females'.", "NTA, but I have this feeling you sounded like one when you were talking to her.\nObviously, there was some misunderstanding. \nI agree with supporting your son, but... it does seem more likely that he overcommitted and shrugged it off.\nIt's also possible she is a little wacky. I'm really curious about her as a neighbor. What has she been like?", "INFO is this lady 80?  Is it possible she thinks it's 1980 when $5 was a reasonable driveway shoveling price?", "Nta. she tried to play you.", "NTA $5 to shovel a walkway? In this economy? No way, that\u2019s ridiculous. She sounds like your typical older lady, who thinks that just bc she\u2019s older, everyone has to do what she says and put up with her nonsense. Sorry doll, it\u2019s a new world.", "NTA \n\nYou handled that well. Not only teaching your son not let people take advantage of him and him standing firm on his price. That sounded to me and I don\u2019t live in a place where it snows.", "(edit: I see he did speak to her. I suggest let him handle it. Stay out of it for now). not an a$$ but you cannot speak for your son. Let him talk to her. He will learn diplomacy and tact. I would suggest he go to her house, apologize and trust that he will do the right thing. I think you have to let him learn himself this situation. :-) I know you meant well and were defending your son :-)", "Well normally if one of my female (or elderly or disabled) neighbors were to ask me for help with a physical task, I would say yes. So the real reason I wouldn't help her was because I was mad at her for waking me up. Otherwise I definitely would have shoveled her driveway. So I was worried I was being petty and spiteful.", "For real $15 is already a steal unless they're the tiniest driveways. I used to shovel my parent's 2 lane driveway and it would take at least an hour or two even there was only an inch or two of snow.", "That sounds like a lot of work, haha. He just wanted to make some quick pocket money to buy a game that went on sale after Christmas.", "My son is thirteen. I remember shoveling a driveway being about a $5 chore when was his age, but inflation is no joke, so I think his price was reasonable.", "He could have, but in this case it might not have helped. He said \"it's $15\" and she somehow understood that as three days at $5 each. How does that leap even happen? If she is so delusional to determine his own price, then who says she wouldn't just try to twist whatever a flyer said?", "In all fairness, he didn't say he offered to shovel their driveways for them, just that he would help if *they asked (nicely, presumably, unlike this harpy)*. Also, he used the word female twice, both as an adjective, both times before *neighbour.* It would be a little clunky to say 'woman neighbour.' Never 'females' as a noun or generalization. I understand the sentiment, but it's misplaced.", "Why would his son have to apologize? He gave the lady a price, she ignored it and basically tried to rip him off. This lady does not deserve an apology. Also I wouldn't call that defending his son, just trying to fend off an entitled ass way too early in the morning.", "No, that would teach exactly the wrong thing. When a customer gets abusive, they should not get coddled. That's what had devil's the entitled idiots we have all seen. There is no way anyone gets a driveway shipped for 5 dollars. This isn't 1970. If the others payed 15, and somehow she just decided that she deserves more, that's on her.", "This I exactly what he did. The lady came back later when the son was awake and spoke directly to him.\n\n>I would suggest he go to her house, apologize and trust that he will do the right thing.\n\nThis is not teaching him diplomacy and tact, this is teaching him to not stand up for himself and letting adults bully him.", "Well. Yeah. Why wouldn't you be pissed at her waking you up. She did it for no reason. She didn't ask nicely. She tried to rip your kid off. Then she asked you for money and demanded free labour out of you.\n\nIf she was there the first time *before* 9 am. What time did she first arrive? Any earlier than 8 and I would have hit her with a snowball. Okay maybe not but I would have been tempted.", "After what she said, you'd have been an AH if you shoveled her driveway or made your son do it. This would teach him that others can trample all over him. Which would be bad parenting. Your son is already more than nice enough to offer shoveling for 15. That's healthy.", "Inflation plus it's his choice for which price to offer it. She didn't have to accept.  In general I think you are completely reasonable. \n\nYour son being 13, i understand she wanted to talk to you. He is minor and you're the guardian. In this situation the referral to solve it with him might have been ok, but maybe in more complex situations he will need your support.", "That's true. She sounds completely delusional!\ud83d\ude12", "If this was 1970, 5$ would be fine. Adjust that for inflation and you get 37.33$ in 2022.

And on one of those rare blessed days (praise be to the Sandman) when I might have gotten eight hours of sleep, she wakes me up at six AM.\n\nWhen my son went out to shovel driveways a couple days ago, he only knocked on doors where the lights were on because he respects people's desire to sleep in on vacation.", "Six. Never mind a snowball, I would have *clocked her*. I hope her property stays forever unshoveled and she gets snow in her boots from walking through it and it takes way too much effort to back out of her driveway. Curses upon her. Fingers crossed.", "NTA. $5 to shovel a driveway is not enough money by any stretch. Even $15 is a steal. She\u2019s cheap and rude.", "NTA. You handled it correctly.\n\nNo one shovels anything for $5.\n\nThis reminds me of a situation 10 years ago between my son and an elderly lady a block away from us. She didn\u2019t really want to pay him for the lawn care work he did. She kept calling me and harassing us to try and get him to come back and do more work. And yes, she paid half what everyone else paid!", "NTA- For $5, I would write my name in the snow on her driveway after drinking loads of coffee.", "NTA.  She was trying to pull a fast one.  Sheesh.", "NTA and that's so awesome that your son ia being so responsible to make thr money to buy a game he wants. This lady is an entitled asshole. 6am?!", "NTA\n\nWhere on God's green earth are kids shoveling driveways for five bucks? Where I live it's more like $20.", "NTA, she's trying yo take advantage of a child, shame on her. Waking you up at 6 is also an AH thing yo do. Good for you OP, sticking to your guns and sticking up for your som. She's a bully.", "NTA", "Empathetic for what??? - NTA!!!", "Definitely NTA. My husband and I pay our own kids $10 an hour to shovel our driveway because we don't want to do it. This woman wanted a whole driveway, presumably including the apron with heavy, plowed snow, shoveled for $5?  She's out of her mind.", "NTA, I admire your son\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and ability to stand up for himself! $5 is seriously insulting, and this lady deserves to have her house skipped by all enterprising young people offering useful services from this day forward!", "NTA\n\nShe was trying to scam a kid. Obviously he didn't agree to $5 if it's enough snow she can't do it herself, or commit to three days.", "Same! Snow was easy money. The only driveway I\u2019d do for free/cheap was my own because my mom had little money. I\u2019d trade my labor for extra dessert or something.", "When I was 6 I shoveled Mrs Butler's porch every time it snowed and she gave me $5. She died in 1997 so it was probably around then.\n\nNo way is someone doing a driveway for $5. Those are long, full of snow, and the end always gets full with plow slush", "Over 20 years ago our neighbor kid offered to shovel the driveway for $5. Kid was maybe 9 years old, our driveway is large enough to park more than half a dozen cars, but Dad agreed to the arrangement. After shutting the front door he laughed, knew the kid wouldn\u2019t be able to do a very good job simply because of the size of the undertaking, but wanted to encourage his initiative so would absolutely pay him regardless of how mediocre a job he did. Not too long after, we hear a noise. The kid\u2019s dad was clearing off the driveway with a snow blower. \n\nTurns out he heard his dad saying he planned to clear our driveway and ran over secure promise of payment before his own dad could show up. All that being said, my dad still paid him $5 for clearing the 20 foot walk from the front door to the driveway as it\u2019s textured stone and difficult to clear. Bottom line, if $5 for an entire driveway was too little decades ago it\u2019s definitely not enough now.", "We pay 40 now", "Fair enough.

Lady was trying to get over on a 13 yo!", "The going rate near me is $30-100 (depending on the size of the driveway and whether walkways are included too). I think it\u2019s a great deal for $30 honestly because shoveling snow is hard work. $5 is an insult\n\nHow big is her driveway and his long would it take for him to shovel it?

You better be knocking on my door because the house is on fire.
