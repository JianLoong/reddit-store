My son usually doesn't like to commit to things in advance like that. I told her she could come back and talk to him when he was awake. She asked me to wake him up, but I said no, because he's on vacation, so why should he have to wake up early if he doesn't want to. The woman was mad and wanted her $15 back. I told her to come back later and ask my son and just shut the door.\n\nShe came back at nine AM, and when my son talked to her he said he never agreed to shovel her driveway multiple days, but that he would do it again for another $15. She was furious and said the price of shoveling a driveway is $5 and she already gave him $15 so he either needed to give her $10 or come shovel her driveway. He said no, he wouldn't shovel a driveway for $5, that's why he told her it was fifteen. If she didn't want to pay fifteen, she should have declined the offer.\n\nShe told me to make my son give her $10, and I said no. I said they had a business arrangement, and it didn't involve me, so I don't care how they resolve it. She said I should shovel her driveway then, and I said no, because she woke me up and I have insomnia, and I don't appreciate that.

She asked if I cared at all about the bad spot my son put her in, and I said I didn't, because he can charge whatever he likes for a service, and if she doesn't want to pay, that's not my problem.\n\nShe said I am an asshole raising an even bigger asshole, and then she left.

If they have two driveways (both of our houses had 2 driveways when I was growing up), add some amount for the extra one.

Also, he used the word female twice, both as an adjective, both times before *neighbour.* It would be a little clunky to say 'woman neighbour.' Never 'females' as a noun or generalization. I understand the sentiment, but it's misplaced.", "Why would his son have to apologize? He gave the lady a price, she ignored it and basically tried to rip him off.

The lady came back later when the son was awake and spoke directly to him.\n\n>I would suggest he go to her house, apologize and trust that he will do the right thing.\n\nThis is not teaching him diplomacy and tact, this is teaching him to not stand up for himself and letting adults bully him.", "Well. Yeah. Why wouldn't you be pissed at her waking you up. She did it for no reason. She didn't ask nicely. She tried to rip your kid off. Then she asked you for money and demanded free labour out of you.\n\nIf she was there the first time *before* 9 am. What time did she first arrive? Any earlier than 8 and I would have hit her with a snowball. Okay maybe not but I would have been tempted.", "After what she said, you'd have been an AH if you shoveled her driveway or made your son do it.

That's healthy.", "Inflation plus it's his choice for which price to offer it. She didn't have to accept.  In general I think you are completely reasonable. \n\nYour son being 13, i understand she wanted to talk to you. He is minor and you're the guardian.

And BRAVO for raising a son that shows entrepreneurship!!", "NTA. She wanted to pay someone $5 for shoveling snow? She\u2019s nuts.", "What year does she think this? \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA; this is nothing to do with you. It's an agreement between your son and your neighbour. Clearly they both have different ideas on what the agreement was. The only thing you should do is talk to your son to make sure he was/is clear on what the service and price was and that he makes it clear going forward.", "Better get it in writing next time. NTA.", "NTA. Your sons price was $15 per day, if she doesn't want to pay that much she can shovel her own snow for free", "NTA\n\nSorry you had to deal with your whack job neighbor and I hope this doesn\u2019t discourage your son from more neighborhood entrepreneurial endeavors. $15/driveway is a great deal!", "NTA\n\nIf you trust your son and believe that he told her $15 per shovel sesh, then she is just being a jerk. Also it sounds like she banged on your door in the very early morning, which is a jerk move to begin. Did she expect him out there at 6 am?", "NTA, but next time, just close the dang door.", "NTA your neighbor is an insane person", "Nah, NTA. I don't know in what decade this woman lives in her head, but shoveling a driveway does NOT cost $5 in 2022. You can't be empathetic to people waking you up with unreasonable demands and getting hysterical about it.", "NTA.  $15 is cheap for shoveling someone's driveway.  She might have gotten some extra help if she'd been nice about it, but some folks just don't have it in them to be decent.", "NTA - and I used to charge $15 - $30 for driveways in the 90s. Your son is pricing his services on the low end, and good for him for showing the initiative to make some cash, and standing his ground in the face of unreasonableness. $5 for a driveway? Maybe in 1960. \nSuggestion for your son, print up a flyer with his prices. Then he has that to point to.", "NTA. I think we all know what \u201cuncivil\u201d word the neighbor is acting like. She\u2019s probably used to being able to dont his at stores to get her way and is now upset that the same tactic doesnt work on the neighbor. \u201cI want to talk to your man- i mean, Parent\u201d.", "Your son can come and shovel mine.  The people living in the basement unit of my building up until last year had a son and I paid him $20/hour.  Usually took him about two and a half hours, so I would just round it up to $60.", "$5 to shovel a driveway? Unlikely. Lol NTA", "NTA\n\nShe sounds fairly entitled. Your son is doing a good job of standing his ground and not bowing to the \"customer is always right\" mentality.\n\nHopefully your kid isn't just blowing smoke about a single day and the woman is right. That wouldn't make you the AH, but it would shift blame from the woman to your son.", "Another vote for NTA.\n\nUse this as an opportunity to teach your son there are some seriously fucked up, over entitled gobshites out there, and from what you said, he handled it brilliantly.  Your son earned that money fair and square, I know exactly how he would feel having to give back $10.  Back when I was around 11/12, I did a deal with someone to sell oak trees.  I'd grown loads of them, they were decent little trees.  I was to get \u00a32 a tree for each one sold.  When it came to being paid, the bloke said \"and \u00a31 a tree as agreed\".  I was quick, but he was an asshole too, just like snow lady, and it really shook my confidence as to how someone could be so dishonest.\n\nNext time, hire a small truck to get son doing snow clearing AND removal.  Then dump the snow somewhere convenient.  Like a womans driveway.....", "When the only 2 teens in my neighborhood last year came out to shovel snow, I looked out the window and eventually the neighbors were serving them hot drinks and pizza between driveways \ud83d\ude02 it was so cute. nta. This lady is rude", "Ok my neighbor always plows our driveway for free with his tractor.  It is something he loves doing and at Christmas we get him a 500 gift card and special bourbons.   He is a great neighbor.  But, my husband uses the snow blower himself on the sidewalks.  My husband works on his house for free as well.  But I would never expect someone to shovel my drive for $5.  That is hard physical work.  Where is the world would anyone think that was enough?  NTA", "Shoveling driveways sucks.  $15 is a steal.", "NTA... $15 was a fucking steal, she needs to get a life. Empathetic for what reason? Everyone else seemingly understood the terms, it's not you or your son's fault that she's an idiot.", "NTA", "Yta", "> it does seem more likely that he overcommitted and shrugged it off.\n\nlol", "Stolen comment from /u/Necessary-Fudge-3218 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyxp46/aita_for_telling_a_woman_i_dont_care_about_her/j28bu9x/)", "Stolen comment from /u/Necessary-Fudge-3218 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyxp46/aita_for_telling_a_woman_i_dont_care_about_her/j28bu9x/)", "She was mean and trying to scam your kid. NTA, not petty. Of course, I usually will pay extra if they do a good job.", "You sound like a great neighbor, but she wasn\u2019t being neighborly. She was being a demanding and entitled AH. And waking you up at 6 AM to boot.", "Yeah I pay my Buddies son 20 and am happy to.  Women is stuck in the 80\u2019s", "Where is the wrong question. It should be when. And the answer to that is probably sometime around the 60s.", "Somewhere that it doesn't snow very much!", "1973...", "1978", "1978", "The 1980s, probably. Maybe the 70s.", "In Brazil.", "My brother charged $5 50 years ago, lol.", "1980", "And it is since many took him up on it. If it wasn\u2019t a deal they wouldn\u2019t have. Basic capitalism, it\u2019s worth what people are willing to pay for that service or product. Did he supply his own shovels too? No wear and tear on their tools. And since no one else thought it was a multi day thing then clearly this woman was trying to pull a fast one. I do agree he should help out elderly or disabled neighbors maybe at a discount or free rate but not liars like that woman.", "First off NTA \n\nSecond it\u2019s great your kid has some entrepreneurial spirit at that age. \n\nMight be a good opportunity to explain how contracts work.", "Very elaborate response. Kudos.", "But he didn't say \"females.\" (noun) He said  \"female neighbors.\" (adjective)", "These driveways need to be at least.... 3 times bigger than this!", "[removed]", "In 1975.", "Nah I was charging 15 - 30 per driveway in 1995. 50 for the super long ones, or if they wanted an all-day guarantee that they could call me back if more snow fell or the plow re-blocked the end of their driveway.", "Terrible deal then too", "OP should probably leave a note reminding her that Reagan isn't the president anymore.", "How is that missing the point? The son clearly didn\u2019t commit to shoveling for $5. That\u2019s a made up number the neighbor tossed back at him.", "Why are you calling u/asecretnarwhal \"kid\"? Just to be a condescending jerk?", "If you'd like the obvious explained: you don't know the kid", "I\u2019da given her 30$ then proceed to snowblow half my yard into her driveway and when she inevitably comes back to bitch about that I\u2019d tell her to take her 15$ in profit and pay a professional snow removal service 30$ to do it and see how that works out for her.", "I really hope you get a good nights sleep tonight. Your neighbor is nuts. NTA", "Would you ask the lady next door to do it for you?", "You are right. \"Woman\" is not an adjective. \"Female\" is. \"Female neighbors\" is the correct way to say it. The problem is when people use \"female\" as a noun to refer to human women. \n\nThe word can, in fact, be correctly used as a noun, but it's usually used that way when talking about livestock or in scientific terms, \"the females of the species...\" For many women (myself included), it feels degrading to be referred to as \"females\" even if the term is technically correct.", "I saw what you did there!", "It was a day job! D-A-I-Y-E!", "Bad bot.\n\nComment partially stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyxp46/aita_for_telling_a_woman_i_dont_care_about_her/j28bu9x?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)", "Because I said the dad is NTA. I said how he presented himself may have seemed assholish, because he was tired and irritated.  I think probably she misunderstood.
