{"id": 33810, "submission_id": "18rertw", "title": "AITA for kicking my brother-in-law out of my home and uninviting him to Christmas celebrations when he was visiting from another state?", "selftext": "**TLDR at the end.** I\u2019ve never been on great terms with my sister Becky\u2019s second husband, Bill. He has an inflated ego and he will talk about his time as a Marine as if he was a war hero, when in reality he had a paper pushing job stateside, had issues with authority, and was a failure to adapt.\n\nNormally my mom hosts Christmas. Becky and Bill stay with her from out of state. Due to circumstances, mom is living with me and I hosted Christmas. I told Becky and Bill they should stay in a hotel. Bill was adamant that if they couldn\u2019t stay with us then they couldn\u2019t afford to come to Christmas. I said they can camp in the living room.\n\nWhen they arrived Bill said he needs a bedroom. He was insistent that it\u2019s proper for kids to give up their room. I said no. Without my knowledge he convinced my kids it would be fun to camp with the cousins in the living room. Fine, I wasn\u2019t going to make an issue of it.\n\nOn the 24th we hosted Christmas Eve. I have a brother, Michael who was injured by an IED in Afghanistan. He has a brain injury. Michael isn\u2019t a fan of Bill. During one of the first times they met, Bill went off on how gays serving openly was \u201can insult to veterans like us.\u201d My brother asked why, Bill gave some reason I don\u2019t recall, then my brother simply said \u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d Bill quickly changed his opinion in favor.\n\nSince that conversation Bill has been extra goofy around my brother, I believe in an attempt to smooth things over. One of Bill\u2019s favorite things to do is to try distracting Michael\u2019s service dog. He will always say he\u2019s joking, that he\u2019s testing how well trained the dog is, keeping the dog on her toes, etc. Bill claims only fellow veterans will understand. This visit was no different. As usual, Bill ignored Michael and his husband asking him to stop. I asked Bill to take something seriously for once, Michael could get hurt.\n\nBill proceeded to imitate Michael\u2019s stutter, dramatically exclaiming \u201coh no, I\u2019m f-f-f-faling!\u201d and pretended like he was tripping and getting hurt. It was cartoonish. It royally pissed me off. I yelled at him to get the fuck out of my house.\n\nSoon the entire family was packing to leave. I made it clear that only Bill wasn\u2019t welcome, Becky and the kids could stay. Becky\u2019s stance was she\u2019s an extension of Bill and where he isn\u2019t welcome she isn\u2019t either. Mom wanted us to reconsider and let Bill back in, for the kids sake. I said again the kids and Becky can stay, go convince them to stay without Bill. Mom said she\u2019s disappointed with me and gave them money for a hotel. She hasn\u2019t spoken with me since the 24th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**. Brother-in-law, Bill, and my sister Becky and her kids were staying at my place for Christmas. After a history of issues with Bill I snapped when he began mocking my disabled brother. I kicked Bill out from my home. Becky and the kids left with him. My mother is upset with me for not being able to look past Bill for the sake of Becky and the kids. For clarity, only Bill was not welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**. Sorry I have to add information this way because my comments were removed for not having 100 comment karma.\n\nBill did not receive a dishonorable discharge. He received a general discharge. He wanted to re-enlist but from what I'm aware of he was essentially administratively barred from it. He tried to join the police academy but couldn't pass the psych exam.\n\nAbout my mom and sister... \n\nNot claiming my sister is free from all blame here, but in her defense our father was a real piece of work. It really messed all of us up. Her first husband was an abusive pig who landed himself in prison. So for what it's worth, Bill is moderately better than the first guy, and Bill isn't all that great. I have more sympathy for her and why she either feels she needs to put up with this behavior or otherwise can't fully see the issues with it. I don't want to cut Becky off because if she wakes up to it I want her to have somewhere safe to go. \n\nMy mom is here temporarily while her home is being fixed from severe storm damage. My little brother has always been her scapegoat. I've always been the one to keep the peace between them. It's complicated, but my tolerance for her is more than my tolerance for Bill.
