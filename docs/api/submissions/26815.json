He\u2019s being immature. And if he can\u2019t have fun without alcohol, he may have a problem. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are growing a person and putting your life at risk to do so. I shudder to think what he\u2019ll be like as a dad.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m concerned that he\u2019s unable to:\n1) prioritize your health over alcohol\n2) prioritize your unborn child\u2019s health over alcohol\n3) doesn\u2019t feel he can have fun without alcohol\n\nThis is seriously concerning and should not be taken lightly.", "NTA.\n\nI hope your husband understands how different yalls life will look once the baby is actually here. You are totally valid for trying to be prepared and responsible. Its not wrong for you to expect your husband to do the same. Hardly anyone gives birth on their due date, anyways - its not unrealistic to labor early. Both of my kids came at 38 weeks.

He sounds self centered.\n\nGet on birth control right away, you can get pregnant soon after birth regardless of breast feeding. \n\nYou will be taking the physical and mental load for childcare as well. You also need a contingency plan for being a single mom in the future.", "NTA at all.  This should be expected.\n\nJust curious - why can't you eat carbs?", "NTA  Decent men are active partners in the pregnancy they helped to create.  If your 3rd trimester isn't enough to get him to stay sober, it's hard to imagine a baby will.

If he wants to get wasted, I just wouldn\u2019t go with him. You need to be calm, cool and collected in this high risk pregnancy not playing drinking games with the frat boy.", "NTA.

Best of luck to you.", "NTA - my girlfriend made the same request. and i found it to be a very reasonable one - driving late at night through the city\u2019s many obstacles can be taxing in normal conditions, that compounded with the side effects of pregnancy makes your request very reasonable. you shouldn\u2019t be made to drive late at night while feeling nauseous and tired after baking a human for however many weeks. \n\nif i\u2019d rather stay out later,  then i drink very little. if i\u2019d rather unwind with a few more drinks then she doesn\u2019t mind driving if we leave at a reasonable time. compromise.", "NTA. Except you do too much for him. Stop cooking all the meals, buying everything you need and finding the fun activities for you to do. You\u2019re teaching him by your actions that you\u2019ll take care of everything, and soon you can add taking care of all the baby\u2019s needs also.

I spent two months before the pregnancy on an anti inflammatory diet doing hormone injections.

He should be thankful that you are still up to go to the concert with him at all.", "You're definitely NTA, and as for your husband, I have a feeling once the baby arrives, he's still gonna be \"having a good time\" since that seems to be his priority.  Best of luck to you and your little one, hopefully he can pull himself together, and if not, you can find support in friends/family.", "NTA but it sounds like he has a drinking problem. Probably time to start addressing it before the stress of a newborn gets here. Good luck and take care of yourself.", "From what's here, NTA. Theres not much of the specifics of the change in workload and what he was allowed during the early stages. However, regardless of that part, it is perfectly reasonable to ask him for that one month to be available in case of an emergency.", "NTA.  You are exactly right that he needs to be ready when the baby decides it\u2019s time.\n\nIf he thinks that is too big an ask for a few weeks, there are other problems.", "NTA\n\nI went into labour naturally with both of mine at 37 weeks, which is completely normal for some women.\nThis is your first baby, so you have no idea what your body will do.\n\nHe is in for a rude shock when the baby arrives, and it sounds like you\u2019ll have 2 babies to deal with.", "NTA. But this reminds me of the birth of my friend\u2019s first baby. She was 3 weeks from her due date, and her husband went out with the \u2018boys\u2019. He came home drunk, and was woken up with a hangover, because my friend\u2019s water had broken. He drove her her to the hospital, and was by her side through a long labor and delivery. For their 2nd baby, he put himself on lock-down a month before her due date.", "NTA. It seems like your husband doesn\u2019t care enough about you nor the children you will have together since it will in convenience his \u201cgood time\u201d. Think about it logically. You\u2019re very pregnant and near your delivery date, yet you still do most of the cooking. You also stated you researched/procured ALL of the baby gear and you\u2019re putting in effort to find activities for both of you to spend time together. On top of all of that, you\u2019re the one driving? Is he trying to find activities that will be comfortable for you as well? Is he taking care of the rest of the household chores? Do you both work or is he the only one working at the moment? Are you a stay at home mom or on maternity leave? Is he an alcoholic? Personally, I would hope my children\u2019s father is not drinking alcohol or smoking anything other than bbq meat around them due to my own beliefs. I feel like you\u2019re way to over stressed and burdened by things your husband should be helping/accommodating you with. I\u2019m sure you have other responsibilities and so does he, but shouldn\u2019t you both be focused on preparing for the baby\u2019s arrival and looking to lessen your workload?\n\nEdit: Also, you\u2019re a HIGH RISK PREGNANCY. I think he should be more attentive to his wife.", "Definitely NTA and it\u2019s a very reasonable request. Your husband sounds selfish honestly. He needs to be prepared for a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario. He\u2019s being selfish, inconsiderate and insensitive for what you\u2019re going though too. Hopefully he steps up better once your baby is born!! \n\nCongrats and good luck!!", "Nta it\u2019s a really reasonable ask specially since it can be dangerous for pregnant women close to their due date.

A pretty severe one.\n\nHard for me to suggest anything since I don't know you, but I wouldn't be in a relationship with an alcoholic. Dude is 33. It's pathetic", "NTA. \n\nIf he can't control his drinking for one month, then he may have a problem.", "NTA, are you sure he is going to be a good father and partner if he isn't willing to stop getting inebriated? It sounds like his priority is drugs and himself. Not you and your child.", "There's a reason this dude is 42 and this is his first child you are NTA But I think you two might need some therapy. And he has some growing up to do.", "NTA.. let him know that you have been putting your mind and body into building a baby and that what you are asking is minimal in comparison.

You're married to someone who has taken zero responsibility for researching/obtaining gear for his soon-to-be-arriving child, who still expects you to cook all his meals, and who can't \"have fun\" without getting shitfaced... And you're asking the internet in the last trimester if asking him to be sober in case something happens makes you an asshole.\n\n\nRagebait? Probably. But if not... Ffs, woman.

I thought this dude was 22... he's 42. 42 and pissed off he can't get drunk at 1 concert. Someone has a substance problem. \n\nWhen you say \"tipsy\"... you need to be saying \"drunk\".

Right on 36 weeks there was a band he was desperate to go and see so I went and had dinner with the group and left them to enjoy the music.  He arrived home at 3 am the next morning in a right mess.

This shouldn\u2019t even be a conversation. It seems to me that your husband is childish and has a lot of growing up to do. This incident makes me feel as though you may be on your own with the bulk of child care.", "I think it\u2019s irresponsible of him but he could be nervous about becoming a new dad and will revert back once he\u2019s comfortable nta though", "ESH. This seems like a rough situation to raise a kid all around.", "NAH but he could do better under the circumstances and he shouldn't expect you to be his Uber.\n\nIt is just at these concerts that he gets drunk or is this a regular occurrence?  If it's a regular occurrence, you have bigger issues.\n\nYou have a high risk pregnancy, why would you want to attend a concert at 36 weeks?  And then have to drive home.\n\nIf this is the last concert for a while, I wouldn't over think it if he does get drunk.  If there are more to come or more drinking before the birth.. then you have bigger issues.\n\nBut I'd be skipping out.  You're tired.  You don't want to up late and then have to drive.  Maybe better to skip this one and whatever happens happens.  He may have to realise that you'll have your secondary support person at your birth and he doesn't get to see his child born.\n\nHopefully you won't be giving birth at 36 weeks.\n\nI remember someone that I know going into labour at 35 weeks.. on a night that her husband had gone out and was rather enebriated.  She came to the hospital alone.  From memory, I think her waters broke which brought her in but wasn't contracting all that much at this point which is why she was able to get herself in.  I think her husband was trying to sober up and someone else was bringing him in.  I've got a feeling he did get dropped off but looked like death warmed up.  She was not impressed at the get go and let everyone know.\n\nI can't remember whether this was her first or second kid this happened with... and if it was her second, then I think her first came early too.. so her husband should've known better....\n\nWhat gets worse, is that it happened again with baby number 3.... I'm not sure they are still together... I think the drinking was a much bigger problem as time went on.\n\nNormally at 35 weeks you'd be pretty safe but not always.  And in reality, you could go into labour at any point so should the partner not drink during the whole pregnancy like the person pregnant?\n\nI'd change my judgement if drinking is an issue in general.", ">My one request has been that he refrain from getting tipsy/drunk one month prior to my due date.\n\nBut now you're mad at him for being drunk when you're at 33weeks.\n\nAlso, potentially being induced at 38 weeks does NOT change your due date. It means you're likely to deliver before your due date. Your due date is still that same it's been.\n\nYour initial request doesn't not make you an AH. Making it a moving target does", "NTA. You also like to have a good time. Yours includes not dealing with a drunk guy, feeling like he actually cares about the wellbeing of yourself and the baby, and not driving if you feel tired or unwell.", "NTA. Is he an alcoholic? My husband was dry my entire pregnancy because I couldn\u2019t drink and he wanted to show his support. This way we didn\u2019t have to have alcohol at home and I didn\u2019t have to deal with the smell (which lets face it, if you don\u2019t drink it stinks).", "NTA \n\nYour husband seems to have a more serious problem than not wanting to help.\n\nHis defensive behavior about his drinking habits indicates he needs intervention. You need to talk to someone who is close to you and get them to discuss it with your husband.\n\nYou cannot take the responsibility of the intervention at this stage of your pregnancy- you have enough to prepare for and deal with.", "Nta imo. Probably bias because I was scheduled to be induced and showed absolutely no signs of labor. my sons dad went out two days before my induction date and lo and behold I went into labor. He made it to hospital and smelt like he drank through three bars. It made me so nauseous he couldn\u2019t be in the room while I was pushing because I kept having to stop and vomit.", "Do you have a friend or family member you can count on to take you to the hospital when you need to go?  Are you sure you feel like going to a concert at 35 weeks, much less driving?", "NTA\n\nYou're not being unreasonable about this. (Though IDK about the mention regarding eating carbs. WTF?)\n\nThough I also wonder why you're still going to shows while being that pregnant if this is a concern for you. I mean, I'm on your side regarding drinking. But it seems like drinking is an essential part of the experience for your husband (which is weird to me, but OK). \n\nYou are not being too demanding. However, I feel like his drinking is going to turn into a problem if he cannot stop drinking for one month before the birth of his child. It sounds like he has a dependency of some sort regarding alcohol.", "NTA, but good god why do so many of us women choose to breed with men like this?", "NTA\n\nYou aren't asking for much.  He needs to take his responsibilities seriously.\n\nI did what you are asking for when my wife was pregnant with both our kids.  I didn't touch alcohol at all during the month before her due date and would drive most places so I could be back in good time if needed.  \n\nIt's probably unlikely that you will go into labour before your due date.  It's probably even more unlikely that if you do it would be when he isn't in a fit state to drive.  However it's simply not worth the risk because sods law says that the minute he has a few drinks that is the time you need him.", "NTA  - A totally reasonable request. You should not even have to say it, he really should be thinking of this himself. Yes, go out and have fun at the concerts but he should have the impending arrival of the baby and his responsibility in driving you to the hospital at the forefront of his mind at the moment, just like you do.", "NTA you husband has a drinking problem if he can't stay sober enough or even stop drinking for a lousy month when you're pregnant. You're his wife ffs you and the baby should always be his number one concern. If he's like this now do you honestly expect him to help you when the baby is born. He is putting himself and booze before your safety. What if you have an accident because you're tired or you go into labor early. He's a selfish cactus", "NTA.\n\nIf you can't count on him *now*, how will you be able to when the baby comes?\n\nParenthood is a full-time job, one where you can't just wash your hands of responsibility when you feel like it.", "NTA. How's MIL? My mother, who spanked us so infrequently that I can count them all on one hand, would beat my brother within an inch of his life for pulling that shit. Like, the woman who only ever shook a wooden spoon at us and went over a decade without using any corporal punishment would be breaking an Amazon warehouse's-worth of them over his head. Hopefully your MIL would do the same. \n\nThe two I got were when I literally asked \"or what, you'll spank me?\" and the time I told her to fuck off as a teen. Tbh, I had it coming. Like, I was a menace. She's patient. She would still commit filicide over what your husband is pulling, unless my dad beat her to the punch. Someone needs to introduce your husband to the business end of their wooden spoon.", "NTA. Sorry you\u2019re having a child with this person.", " Before you get any closer to your due date, your husband needs an alcohol evaluation.  If you\u2019re breastfeeding, he won\u2019t need to be sober because you will be.  I think he plans to keep partying the way he always has, so the mom (you) will always have to be the sober, responsible one.  When will you ever feel that it will be safe to leave him alone with your child?  He\u2019s about to become a parent, too; it\u2019s time for him to grow the fuck up, become a responsible parent-to-be/parent and stop worrying about when he can get drunk.

Smoking anything around a baby is a terrible idea, and just because it\u2019s weed and not a cigarette doesn\u2019t make it okay. If he\u2019s dadding right, he\u2019s likely to be so sleep deprived that even driving sober might be iffy, let alone slightly buzzed. And if something happens to you or the kid (or later, a play date) and he can\u2019t be a 100% sober and safe presence, irreparable harm could be done. If he can\u2019t make it one month, how will he manage for the next X years?\n\nIt sounds like he is substance dependent. Sure, everyone might like to have a good time, but for people without a dependence (and / or with good judgement), they don\u2019t *need* to consume the substance to enjoy themselves to the point that they would sacrifice the well-being of a loved one. Even if you take on 100% of child care, having someone with substance dependence around your child will take a toll - on you and the kiddo. Take some time to think about this and start lining up resources for yourself in the event that you need them. \n\nRemember that the future is promise to no one, and we don\u2019t know what tomorrow holds. If you have a medical issue like postpartum depression or need to recover from a c-section and literally can not take on childcare during that time, do you have friends or family who can step in? If he\u2019s drunk or high when you go into labor, do you have a medical directive in place and someone available and ready who can make decisions on the spot about you and baby\u2019s health if you are unable to do so?\n\nBest of luck. Maybe holding his baby for the first time (if he\u2019s sober) will bring clarity to him and he\u2019ll turn out to be a great dad immediately. But please plan for what if in case he doesn\u2019t.
