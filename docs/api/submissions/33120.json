Mine has always been a green bean casserole. It's nothing fancy, just a random recipe I found online.\n\n\nA few years ago, Amy joined our group. There have been 0 issues with Amy until parties. My casserole was overhyped and after tasting it, Amy said she could do better. I gladly passed casserole duty to her. It \"didn't hit the same\", and it was gently suggested to get passed back to me.\n\n\nAmy took this personal. For years, she texted me after parties about how offended she is that I keep making the dish to spite her, and how bad it tastes. She's even \"accidentally\" brought her own green bean casserole several times.\n\n\nThis Thanksgiving, Amy snapped over someone complimenting my casserole. She screamed at everyone for pandering to me, how I'm out to get her, and for everyone hating her family since her recipe has been passed down for generations. Then she stormed out.\n\n\nWe all talked afterwards, and I explained this had been going on for years, even showing the her texts. Everyone said it was out of character for Amy, and wondered if something else is going on. As far as I'm aware, it's only the casserole. We get along 100% otherwise.\n\n\nI took Amy, her husband, and my husband out for coffee to talk, and was told it was all a misunderstanding. Amy has been struggling with depression, so it was within her rights to act how she did. I asked how I could help, but Amy said questions like those were what her therapist warned her of me attempting to manipulate her. We agreed to end our talk there since we were getting heated in public, and hadn't talked since.\n\n\nWhen the groupchat began planning Christmas dishes, Amy went out of her way to say I should make the casserole since I accused her of \"hating it\", and she wouldn't want everyone to feel more uncomfortable than I'm making a misunderstanding out to be. When I tried to speak up, everyone said I shouldn't take things so seriously, and to sympathize with Amy going through a rough patch.\n\n\nTo me, Amy has made it well aware that something to do with myself or the casserole is causing her so much turmoil over the years. She simply won't talk to me about it, just claims I never listen to her.\n\n\nI have no plans to make the casserole, but now I don't want to go to the Christmas party. My husband thinks it's unfair for me to do to everyone, and that I shouldn't exclude myself from a fun time. I told him there's no hard feelings of him going on his own, but he says I'm missing the point. He says such a minor thing shouldn't affect years of good moments with Amy and our friends.\n\n\nI fully understand how depression affects people, but it's hard for me to accept as a get-out-free card. I'm very confused, and failing to see why this shouldn't be taken seriously. \nAITAH??", "created_utc": 1702725000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jp2d9/aitah_for_refusing_to_make_my_green_bean/", "score": 4255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And people asking how they can help isnt a form of manipulation - her therapist would never say that.

Seems like they are using her depression as an excuse and they are not dealing with whatever is really behind the casserole fixation.\n\nIf you don't want to go, don't.

FUCK EVERYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS BUT YOURS!\n\nAmy is unhinged over some shitty casserole (no offense but green been casserole is just ....whatever) If it was black forest cake or something, then yeah, let's fight.\n\nIf you don't feel like it , then the rest of them can go to hell.

YOU don't get those good moments, because AMY AAAAMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYYY won't let go of a casserole. THEY haven't had to get the texts, or have the argument in public. they all get to sit on their fat casserole eating high horses and enjoy the time together.

You don't need that drama in your life.", "I think her therapist is giving advice on the screwed version Amy is describing in sessions, so I would take that with a pinch of salt. \n\nHowever, still go. Maybe bring a new dish that people will enjoy.

But you should go to the party anyway.", "I'm sorry but if Amy is discussing a green bean casserole with her therapist,  it's an indication to me that she's a bit self obsessed.  I think you should factor her completely out of the equation; make your casserole,  go to the party and have a great time. Ignore Amy and be civil but walk right past any silly comments from her about a casserole.  Time to stop feeding this narcissistic beast.", "Amy is being manipulative about a damn bean casserole! It\u2019s not your fault hers was rubbish tbh! It\u2019s not your fault or your casseroles fault that she is going through depression. Do what will make you happy. NTA", "NTA. It sounds to me like she's trying to make you feel bad in order for her to feel better because depression is not a reason to treat people like that.", "NTA  \n\nHell, she even said to make it.  Let her feel bad is she wants to.  Let her stomp and cry all she likes, you're not responsible for managing her big feels.  And she probably lied about the therapist...like either what she told them and/or their response.  \n\nGo to the party with your casserole and ignore her.  Have fun!", "NTA and something is really very wrong with her and\u2026. She\u2019s saying something to the friends for them to behave like that too.  \n\nGo and have fun.  Take a dish that\u2019s completely different and unexpected, perhaps a dessert or buy something from a shop. if anyone asks, say along the lines of that you\u2019re just trying to fly below the radar and not cause any issues, that you bought the most harness thing possible and hoped no one would get offended and everyone can just enjoy the good timesz", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go either. Amy has been doing this for years. Your friends are being dismissive and are not realizing that people don\u2019t have a multi-year rough patch over a casserole.", "From the very beginning, Amy has been behaving so badly I wonder that she's still in your friend group. What normal adult person attends a Christmas party, tastes a casserole, curls her lip, and says \"I could do better.\"  And it's only gotten worse from there.  She's treated you abysmally.\n\nI think you can make or not make whatever dish you choose.

She is probably jealous of more than your casserole skills. \nDon't make the dish and take something else. See what else she kicks off on, stand back and watch.   If your friend group wants green bean whatever so much they can find someone else to throw to the wolves, aka Amy.  If she doesn't complain about the new bean casserole then it's definitely personal.\nThis woman is batshit crazy and not worth appeasing", "NTA.\n\nBut go to the party and bring something else like Swedish beetroot salad  or  anything else then the  green been casserole which seams to be a trigger for Amy.", "NTA - As someone with depression that doesn't sound right. It sounds more like her actions are stemming from jealousy and insecurity. After she tried making the green bean casserole and everyone preferred yours, she probably became insecure and embarrassed after saying she could make a better dish. Then, as the years continued and everyone still liked your dishes better, she spiralled into jealousy towards you for, in her eyes, being better than her. Her actions are 100% not your fault. And with how uncomfortable she must be making social gatherings I totally understand not going.\nThese are her own issues to deal with, hopefully your other friends will see this over time", "NTA. She sounds like she is projecting her own insecurities onto you. I would go to the party with a new dish and stay well away from her. Maybe try the \u201cgray rock\u201d method with her so she moves on to someone else.", "NTA depression isn\u2019t an excuse to treat people like shit or to throw temper tantrums like a toddler", "Nta. Don\u2019t go this year. My guess is she will then turn her ire on another member of the group without you there.", "NTA, at this point I'd skip the party too. Or make just enough casserole for myself.\n\nSounds like Amy has tainted that friend group and it's time to move on. That or just make an awful casserole when -trying a new recipe-.", "Amy is manipulating you. If you exclude her opinions from the table, you want to make the casserole, your friends want you to make the casserole and they also want you to be present for your party. Don't let one person's personal struggles and mental issues isolate you from the rest of your friends or make you hate something you liked doing and were proud of because other people like it too. Amy needs to deal with her shit. She is not your responsibility.\n\nThe question about the verdict is a bit confusing but I think Y W B T A to your other friends if you use Amy's issues to skip party with them and treat them with the casserole. If you are ignoring your own wishes and just swaying by the whims of others, then their wishes and preferences deserve to be taken with at least as much weight as Amy's.

She set up a competition with you using a casserole to win her place in the family and you won. You weren't competing but she was.

Amy's therapist should be helping her here but seems to believing her that you are the issue (if Amy honest which she probably wasn't). You can't win that one so step away.\n\nYou not going is probably going to make the whole situation worse but you may need for your short-term mental health. Amy may see you not going as her having won. But the rest of the family are going to be unhappy and fair chance that will make her spiral.

But they are not the ones she feels she need to compete with just to compete for.", "NTA  Tell everyone that due to Amy having such a hard time handling her depression for so many years that it seems to get worse when your casserole is presented that you'd like new suggestions on what they'd like you to bring.

And perhaps not going would read to some of your friends like you do feel some responsibility for her feelings. Or maybe it would feel like a victory to Amy that you\u2019re not there.\n\nBring a different dish, be prepared to sparkle, and anytime that wet sock enters a room you\u2019re in, keep well away from her drama.

I wouldn't waste my time on people who rather soothe the egos of the Amys of the world, but your friends, you'd know. \n\nDo you want to make the casserole? I'm not American, so I'm not entirely sure what a green bean casserole is. Green beans are something I eat steamed served with butter and occasionally macadamia or almonds lol. But if you want to go to this thing with your casserole, you should. \n\nMy point is, Amy doesn't get to decide how YOU live your life. YOU do. So block her, grey rock her, move on. She'll get bored if you don't feed her crazy.", "NTA - I have major clinical depression. It doesn't do THAT to someone. She's got something else going on, and she's clearly giving a very warped version of events to her therapist. \n\nHonestly, I had kind of a similar situation happen years ago. We had an annual Christmas party in a high school friend group that one friend in particular had begun hosting. They dropped the ball in planning it, so I picked it back up to continue the tradition. I never insisted I always hosted, and there were never any complaints. It's just how it happened since I had the best space for it and no one else ever offered. Years later, one of my close friends told me the original host was making regular snide comments about me \"stealing\" the party. They said something like \"good luck getting it away from her\" and accused me of ruining things for them. So I was like \"yes, please take it back!\" I hate people in my house, and I was literally hosting *for them*. They did one awkward holiday party the next year, and there hasn't been a group party since. I refuse to overextend myself for someone so ungrateful anymore, so I just didn't pick up the ball when they dropped it again. \n\nWhich is all to say that some people get a bug in their bonnet about something, cannot let it go, and do not handle conflict appropriately. It can't be helped.

Honestly if I were you (and I hope not - for you - since I'm a sarcastic french lol) I'd just screen all the texts she sent me over the years to send them in the groupchat if there's one, and tell them no thanks, my recipe seems to be shit and disgusting, I don't want you guys to eat it just so as not to upset me.\n\nIf you want to go, just go. And cook another recipe, not the green beans, to keep the peace - or to be petty since the green beans recipe is apparently a hill to die on for her. If you don't want to go, don't go.

This is about Amy manipulating the group with her talk of depression in order to get them on her side, and the group falling for the manipulation.

So she makes snide comments, gets upset when people don\u2019t like her dish, and gets heated when OP shows compassion while trying to sort out the problem. \n\nOP could go and bring a different dish, and the problem will still persist. Because it\u2019s not about the dish. It\u2019s about how Amy sees her as some sort of competition in the group and is trying to \u201cwin\u201d some sort of non-existent competition, but it\u2019s also about the other people in the group accepting AH behavior because they don\u2019t seem to get that being depressed doesn\u2019t entitle you to be an AH. No wonder OP doesn\u2019t want to go! I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to, because the joy of it is being sucked out by this very obnoxious person. But I might also choose to go anyway because I have a stubborn streak and wouldn\u2019t want her to win. \n\nI think it may be worth OP having a discussion with the group members either together or one-on-one about Amy, about the YEARS of her awful behavior, about how she tried to clear the air but Amy blew up at her, and about how being depressed doesn\u2019t excuse one from being an AH. This may escalate to an either me or Amy situation, which OP has been avoiding, but Amy is probably trying to make happen.

They will try to turn other members of the group against you and tell themselves that you're out to 'get them' now. They have created a massive popularity war in their mind and they will do all they can to get the rest of the group to say how much better their offering is than yours. That's when they will feel they 'won'. Unfortunately, no one else knows or cares about the casserole or potatoes as much as that person because for them - quite reasonably, I might add - it's just food at a party.
