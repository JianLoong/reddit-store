Last year was the first year we spent it at my brother (20s) and his wife (20s). Due to it being their first time, they were understandably very stressed and had troubles getting things together especially taking into account my dietary restrictions.\n\nLast year I (F20s) didn\u2019t live in the same city as them so I couldn\u2019t really help with the preparations but this year I do. Since I\u2019m a student the money is tight but my brother and sil earn extremely well even compared to our parents. When we spent the Christmas at our parents we didn\u2019t have to contribute financially towards the feast but this year the cost are shared by our parents and them. As I can\u2019t afford it my compensation is the organization and cooking the feast as none of them enjoy such things. This is not a small task since I\u2019ll have to start the preparations days before Christmas and do everything on my own.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m not the one paying for the meal I have shared my plans weeks ago with all of them and they have agreed on the menu. Couple days ago I sat down and calculated how much all of this would cost and sent the info to my family. This did not go down well with my brother.\n\nHe is extremely frugal which is fine and all but the cost of the feast is the same as it has been every year. Mind you, it is nothing crazy honestly but costs more than a regular everyday meal. \n\nI said fine we can cut something back if he wants and asked what he wanted to give up. He chose the one thing I wanted to make for myself as a treat since almost everything else is something I can\u2019t eat but the rest of them can eat all of it. I said okay anything else but he didn\u2019t want to give up anything else. I asked him if he was serious that \u201dmy dish\u201d would be the only one we would get rid off and not one of their multiple sides. I don\u2019t want to eat only potatoes and salad.\n\nHis response was that it\u2019s all so expensive and since it\u2019s something that most of us wouldn\u2019t eat it didn\u2019t make sense to make it. My brother pulled the same move last year and my mother put her foot down and forced my brother to include me. Since then he has constantly told us \u201dhow we are so emotional and stir up unnecessary drama\u201d\n\nSo to his opinion I said that it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just not attend and spent the Christmas by myself since I can\u2019t afford to pay for the dish since I already provide my main\n\nMy brother got mad and said that it\u2019s not what he meant.\n\nI replied that this would be the most elegant solution to the problem since the feast would be cheaper and I wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard for a meal I can\u2019t eat. And this would have the added bonus of not causing  too much drama since I\u2019d do so voluntarily (I know I\u2019m probably an ah just for this)\n\nHe got super mad at me while my mother got mad at him and decided to spend the Christmas at my place. Now everyone is mad at everyone but honestly I\u2019m mainly just sad and feel like I ruined everyone\u2019s Christmas.

Our family was huge until I was in my 30s. (then parents, grandparents, great grandparents died,  others moved away).  It was never ever even a moment's blip for our family.  NOBODY wanted any one person to have to struggle with food prep.  We ALWAYS did a covered dish thing.  It was never even a question.  It was just the natural response.

So toxic.", "NTA, from my take, they know you are vegan, have been for years, and the additional costs are only $5-6! That is a ridiculously small amount of money for your brother to take a stand on when it means deliberately excluding you from eating. He is well aware that you don\u2019t have the money yourself and has already agreed to help foot the costs. And you are doing all the work cooking! This is a stupid hill for him to die on. If I had someone offering to do all the cooking for me I\u2019d be glad to throw in a little extra money. The cooking is the hard part.

What about his IL\u2019s? Did they contribute too? Because this sounds like your bro and his wife were wanting someone else to do the heavy lifting. And you didn\u2019t play along.

I was leaning towards E S H because I thought that you had gone straight to \"fine I just won't come!\" but I see that you looked for reasonable options first. So, I'm going with NTA. You're not at fault for stepping away. You had all arrived at a democratic solution weeks ago, your brother's reaction this week was miserly, and your response was reasonable, given that you are paying for your own main, and would be left with potatoes and salad while everyone else enjoyed a feast that you labored over for days.

So for example my brother is bringing cheese and wine, my parents are cooking and bringing the meat and we\u2019re doing all the sides etc. this way none of us take a huge hit and we can all celebrate together. For us it\u2019s wanting to all be together and we don\u2019t have an issue with bringing things to the table to do so. I get that this might not be the normal way to do things but it means we can be together instead of all having separate Christmas\u2019. \n\nIn this case though NTA. I don\u2019t see any reason why he would need to stop the one thing you can eat and it seems deliberately cruel in this context.\n\nEdit. I replied to the wrong person I meant to reply to the person who said usually this situation you\u2019d do a \u201cpot luck\u201d", "I'm Jewish, but I'd think Matthew 25:35 is a bit appropriate for Christmas, right?", "And in cases where the host can't afford food,  they'll set up a pot luck sort of deal,  not charge. \n\nI've never heard of families charging for Christmas dinner before.  That just feels so gross to me. \n\nNta", "I didn\u2019t explicitly explain him my reasoning but rather used the same reason as always ie I love cooking so I don\u2019t mind. But yeah I guess that\u2019s what happened", "No they don\u2019t. My brother decided on his own that no presents this year and had some good points so I wasn\u2019t too opposed. But since he didn\u2019t really include us in the conversation I\u2019m still \u201dgetting\u201d them something. And by getting them I mean I\u2019m doing something home made as a present (mainly pastries and stuff) as I have done every year as I can\u2019t afford to buy anything", "Oh the veganism is not the problem. He is more than happy to eat vegan food especially if someone prepares it for him. It\u2019s just that he feels that this one side dish or actually a spread to put on a bread is not necessary since he won\u2019t be eating it as I\u2019m preparing a similar spread for the rest of them that\u2019s not vegan since my mother asked for it.\n\nAnd as for my mother she will most likely to be the one to get my brother to change his position. But I\u2019m sorry to put her into this position once again since it\u2019s hard on her too. I feel like at this point my brother and I should be able to resolve things without her but I don\u2019t see that happening. He in general doesn\u2019t appreciate my thoughts and opinions on things so this is really nothing new", "Impact matters more than intent here. Doesn\u2019t matter what the brother\u2019s reasons are, his actions and the consequences remain the same.", "To be fair to him he is not a bad person in general. He just is extremely strict with his money. I think the reason why I\u2019m singled out is that he has more respect towards his wife and our mother to not pull this sort of thing on them. And they are taking part in paying for the feast as well\u2026", "Caring about other people is an important prerequisite to being a good person in my books. But you know him better than I do, so okay.", "I hate to be the one to tell you this but all these traits you listed above DO make him a bad person.", "Sooooo he\u2019s an asshole", "He sounds very self-centered. I think your family needs to  sit him down and tell him that his behaviors are going to result in people not wanting to spend time with him anymore.", "Ok thanks, I get it. Your brother and his wife are not stellar hosts. He probably doesn\u2019t realize that his kids are going to be charging to eat at their homes in idk, 10-20 years or so. I hope he takes it well when the shoe\u2019s on the other foot.", "Going on about the cost of one home cooked meal that they can well afford since the summer makes me think your brother needs therapy. This is really extreme.", "Your heart is in the right place and you sound so nice and caring. I will hold my bitterness back because you sound like you would bend overbackwards for anyone but know that one day you might break from bending so much. Have a happy holiday no matter where and who it is with.", "Just because he's not a bad person doesn't mean he's not behaving badly. You're not being mean if you acknowledge that this behavior of his has hurt you. Instead of that, you're blaming yourself for ruining Christmas. You sound like a very thoughtful person, who wants to do right by their family. You don't have to take on the guilt and anxiety that your brother should be feeling. It's not fair to you! I think people are speaking in such strong language about your brother because you are so unwilling to do so, and we all want you to see how completely in the wrong he is, and how completely fair and reasonable your choices and feelings are."]}
