Last year was the first year we spent it at my brother (20s) and his wife (20s). Due to it being their first time, they were understandably very stressed and had troubles getting things together especially taking into account my dietary restrictions.\n\nLast year I (F20s) didn\u2019t live in the same city as them so I couldn\u2019t really help with the preparations but this year I do. Since I\u2019m a student the money is tight but my brother and sil earn extremely well even compared to our parents. When we spent the Christmas at our parents we didn\u2019t have to contribute financially towards the feast but this year the cost are shared by our parents and them. As I can\u2019t afford it my compensation is the organization and cooking the feast as none of them enjoy such things. This is not a small task since I\u2019ll have to start the preparations days before Christmas and do everything on my own.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m not the one paying for the meal I have shared my plans weeks ago with all of them and they have agreed on the menu. Couple days ago I sat down and calculated how much all of this would cost and sent the info to my family. This did not go down well with my brother.\n\nHe is extremely frugal which is fine and all but the cost of the feast is the same as it has been every year. Mind you, it is nothing crazy honestly but costs more than a regular everyday meal. \n\nI said fine we can cut something back if he wants and asked what he wanted to give up. He chose the one thing I wanted to make for myself as a treat since almost everything else is something I can\u2019t eat but the rest of them can eat all of it. I said okay anything else but he didn\u2019t want to give up anything else. I asked him if he was serious that \u201dmy dish\u201d would be the only one we would get rid off and not one of their multiple sides. I don\u2019t want to eat only potatoes and salad.\n\nHis response was that it\u2019s all so expensive and since it\u2019s something that most of us wouldn\u2019t eat it didn\u2019t make sense to make it. My brother pulled the same move last year and my mother put her foot down and forced my brother to include me. Since then he has constantly told us \u201dhow we are so emotional and stir up unnecessary drama\u201d\n\nSo to his opinion I said that it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just not attend and spent the Christmas by myself since I can\u2019t afford to pay for the dish since I already provide my main\n\nMy brother got mad and said that it\u2019s not what he meant.\n\nI replied that this would be the most elegant solution to the problem since the feast would be cheaper and I wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard for a meal I can\u2019t eat. And this would have the added bonus of not causing  too much drama since I\u2019d do so voluntarily (I know I\u2019m probably an ah just for this)\n\nHe got super mad at me while my mother got mad at him and decided to spend the Christmas at my place. Now everyone is mad at everyone but honestly I\u2019m mainly just sad and feel like I ruined everyone\u2019s Christmas. AITA?\n\n//EDIT to add:// I have seen a lot of comments saying that they would like to help me to contribute financially towards the meal. While I find these offers extremely kind, I simply feel like this wouldn\u2019t be appropriate since I will be fine regardless of the outcome of my Christmas. Instead I\u2019d like ask you to consider donating (only if you truly can) e.g. to your local homeless shelters, food banks etc. so that those who have nothing or very little could have something for the holidays.

No one of us can afford to host Christmas so we do a sort of \u201cbring some stuff\u201d situation. So for example my brother is bringing cheese and wine, my parents are cooking and bringing the meat and we\u2019re doing all the sides etc. this way none of us take a huge hit and we can all celebrate together. For us it\u2019s wanting to all be together and we don\u2019t have an issue with bringing things to the table to do so. I get that this might not be the normal way to do things but it means we can be together instead of all having separate Christmas\u2019. \n\nIn this case though NTA.

Your brother is being unreasonable. If the issue is truly the cost (and could be since you don't actually know their whole financial situation), good manners alone dictate that he not choose to cut the one thing you prepare for yourself. Especially when you are doing the cooking. And, it also makes light of your contribution. Preparing the meal singlehandedly is a lot of work. Work that no one else in your family cares to do.  However, you could have settled this by setting a boundary. \"I am doing the cooking for everyone and catering to the majorities taste and preference. The dish you want to cut, is the only one that I am preparing to suit my needs. We can cut the similar dish rather than have 2 versions of it if you want. But cutting mine is not negotiable.\" He can argue but presumably since you are doing the cooking, you will also be doing the grocery shopping.  Or at least making the grocery list.  Your mother should probably not gotten involved at all other than to possibly point out that your brother was not the sole decision maker for a family meal unless he was covering all of the costs, doing the grocery shopping and preparing the meal.  Ultimately, as personal as food is and no matter how much we attach meaning to traditions, one dish should not \"ruin\" Christmas for anyone. You saying you just wouldn't come to Christmas and taking a victim stance is manipulative  and contributed to the drama.  Apologize for that, state that you will be cooking your dish and can cut the other one to save some of the costs and that if anyone would prefer a different dish be cut instead (other than the one you are making for yourself), this is the time to speak up. And then stand your ground. Standing your ground is merely repeating, \"Since I am contributing to the meal by cooking and that is a major contribution, I will make my favorite. That's not negotiable.\" Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Then your brother can either agree or cough up 1/2 the money for one dish. I can't imagine the savings are significant only cutting out one item, so the whole argument seems completely pointless.", "NTA.

I wonder what he's thinking? You say that he makes good money, but you say that he's always this frugal. He sounds like he's genuinely concerned about the costs. If the costs are a burden to him, I understand wanting to lower them however he can, but picking your vegan dish is still AH behavior.

Planning, calculating costs within a budget, shopping, and preparing an entire Christmas meal is A LOT of work.\n\nThe fact that he would choose the one dish you want to keep to scrach is extraordinarily petty.

But no one in your family is doing that for you.

Why can't they eat the leftovers as you already cooked them? \n\nThey're using you. They want a cushy holiday that they don't have to cook for and because you don't have any money they're using that as an excuse to make you do all this work. If you work this out and end up doing Christmas there, I hope you put your foot down and say you won't do the leftovers cooking. \n\nLet me put this in a slightly different perspective for you that you may not have considered. Your budget is $200. I'm not sure whether your brother is paying all of this or if your parents chip in for this too. \n\n* If your parents aren't splitting it and it would just be your half and your brothers half, it would be $100 each.\n* If you all three parts of the family were able to pitch in evenly, you'd each be responsible for $66. \n* If it was split evenly across the number of people eating (sounds like 5 people), that would be $40 each. \n\nPersonally, I think the last one is the one we should be going by since you are one person and the other family units are each 2 people and you obviously aren't going to enjoy as much of the food as they are. Since your family/brother likes to break things down so it's even, this only seems fair. \n\nYou are contributing WAY, WAY, WAY more than $40 worth of effort. Frankly, you're putting in way more than even $100 worth of effort. How many hours do you put into this? I'm guessing a lot. I cook my family dinners too and it usually an entire day just for the cooking.\n\nYour brother is acting like the cost of the food is the only piece that has value here. I realize the point of you cooking is so you can pitch in some value yourself, but it has to be balanced. And now that he is for bidding you a SIX DOLLAR MEAL (unbelievable), I am certain he is just taking advantage of you. \n\nYour brother is only looking at the specific monitary value that his money adds and is completely ignoring the value that your efforts bring. \n\nWhat would happen if you did have that $40-$100 to contribute? How would you divvy up the cooking then? Presumably you'd do 1/3 or 1/2 of the cooking in that situation. You're only responsible for contributing what you can't. You don't have to match that entire $200 value. \n\n**You're only responsible for the piece you can't afford since you're brother is responsible for his portion of the contribution regardless of that.** \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to sit down and think about how much your time and effort to plan, budget, shop, and cook all this food is worth. Is it minimum wage? Is it more than minimum wage? For a $40 contribution, anything over 5 1/2 hours is putting in more than a mimimum wage worth of effort. And you are obviously worth way more than that. \n\nI know it sucks to reduce this to nickels and dimes, but your brother is asking for it when he refuses to pay for your $6 side.", ">My main is not included in the budget but theirs is which is about 30% of the budget.\n\nAlso, stop allowing this. You are family! If their main is included, your main should be included. The whole point is that you are doing the cooking as your part of a FAMILY MEAL. If they can't include your meal as part of the family meal then there is no reason you should be cooking for them at all.\n\nIf you are expected to do 100% of the planning, shopping, and cooking, then your brother is expected to pitch in 100% of the costs. If he's not willing to do that, then he needs to pitch in and cook some of the food to match the amounts you are putting in, just like you are cooking to match the amounts he puts in. That is the only way it is fair.\n\nRight now the way your family is going about it, when he pays for the food, you have to cook it. When you pay for the food, you also have to cook it. How is that fair?", "Sorry for the multiple replies, but I am still trying to figure out how your family came to this arrangement and decided it was fair.\n\nI can't get over the fact that your brother is contributing $200 to feed himself, his wife and your parents, thinks your food somehow doesn't make it into the budget, and yet you're the one that is doing all the cooking.\n\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your brother.\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your SIL\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your parents\n* You're cooking the food YOU PAID FOR that is for you.\n\nI'm sorry, this arrangement is completely unfair.

I was thinking meeting for dessert that afternoon/evening would work if that sounds good to you.) At this point, you will have done what you can do as a course correction and it is up to your brother to meet you halfway. He can be gracious and accept the compromise or he can continue to argue. If he continues to argue, it is perfectly acceptable to say, \"I appreciate your financial concerns and ask you to think about my contribution too. Although I am not contributing monetarily, I am contributing a significant amount of time and effort and that has value.  As a contributor, I insist that this dish be included.

You are being too easily cowed and too apologetic.  The right way to fix this is for him to get over it and just have the meal cost what it costs, with generous portions for the others and your special dish for you.   His is a false economy.   He doesn't need it, he's just doing it because either he's cheap and the amount sounds huge because he's never thought of it before, or he is specifically targeting you out of some particular version of sibling rivalry.  Either way,  you should go back to \"I'm making what I'm making and you will enjoy it.\"", "Definitely NTA. He's the one who's ruining it with this weird miserly crap.\n\nINFO: even with sitting out xmas, you're not still planning on cooking everything for them but not going right?! Please say no bc that would be unbelievably unfair and you shouldn't have to do that. \n\nSpeaking of unfair, I also want to point out that based on how you described it, it seems like the amount of labor you're putting in FAR exceeds the cost of chipping in for food. In other words, if you were to go along with this plan of you cooking and others paying (which I really hope you don't), you're getting the short end of the stick. I don't think you said how much the total cost of the food is, but I can't imagine it's more than 100, 150 bucks. If you have to start cooking days in advanced, at a labor cost of $20/hr, you're likely \"paying\" far more than anyone else chipping in for the food. \n\nAnyways, I hope you and your mom have a great little xmas together :)", "He\u2019s saying *you\u2019re* the one that\u2019s causing drama when *he\u2019s* the one that has an issue with it? \n\nBro NTA, you\u2019re brother is purposely trying to exclude you and make it seem like you\u2019re the problem when it\u2019s actually him.", "You didn't ruin everyone's Christmas. Scrooge McBrother ruined it.\n\nWell off penny pinchers are the worst", "NTA\n\nIt's ridiculous that he wants you to prepare a meal you can't eat as your contribution to a family dinner he's \"hosting\" all because he thinks his financial contribution is too much.", "NTA", "Has your brother ever watched a z Christmas Carol?  He should", "Why is your family being so complicated!? If you host, you should expect to buy the food and cook. Maybe everyone else can bring a dish to pass to add to the meal. It shouldn\u2019t be this complicated. NTA.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is a dick.", "We\u2019ve had people bring casseroles but not money.", "This exactly.", "Why is she the asshole - just curious", "We don\u2019t really have a choice on the matter due to multiple reasons. One is that our parents are old and sickly so the stress would not be good for them. Another is that they live pretty far away so the travel costs would prevent me from attending. A third is that our jobs etc keep us here for the holidays but our parents are able to get a few days off around Christmas. There are other reasons but I won\u2019t be listing them off here", "I\u2019m definitely not cooking for them if I\u2019m not going. They can figure out all the prep and cooking by themselves. I\u2019m not lifting a finger for them other than maybe for the presents. And I\u2019ll not be delivering those on the day of either since I\u2019ll be too busy with my own plans. But I still want to bake something for them even if just out of spite (I know he will not feel good about those goodies if I do this) kill them with kindness and all ;)", "Why the fuck are they even hosting if they aren\u2019t paying or cooking??\n\nIs everyone missing the facts which are \n\nA) BROTHER WANTS TO HOST\n\nB) brother is making his parents foot the cost of hosting\n\nC) brother and his wife have shafted all hosting duties onto his sister\n\nD) not only do they not want to host, cook or provide, they expect OP to starve due to dietary requirements.\n\n\nEdit to add\n\nE) brother has a history of excluding and bullying OP.", "He\u2019s well off and yet can\u2019t put money toward a family dinner? What a miser.", "I\u2019m going to have a hard time getting that pic out of my mind!", "If the one thing you eat is Unnecessary, it absolutely is about excluding you", "Why do you keep letting him host things? I would just not go", "Back in the day, my mom would host 20-40 people for Christmas. It wasn't so much the money as the TIME to prepare food for that many people. She'd prepare the main dishes and a couple sides, but would ask others (usually 1 item per family) to bring along a dessert, appy or side dish. Worked out great for everyone.\n\nI can't ever imagine asking for MONEY from people I invited to my home for a meal!", "Yup, and coming from a toxic family, the cutting off of the truly foul is sooo good", "Girl. I spent $200 on two people for the holidays two years ago. What. That's an insanely small budget. \n\nThe cost of your contribution, if they were going to be paying for it, is WELL above $200. Doing all the shopping, not at one, but multiple grocery stores, then cooking over multiple days for 5 people. Does your brother have any idea how much people pay for a person who does that for them? \n\nAnd he's now complaining over 3$? Less than a Starbucks coffee. That's not frugal, that's straight cheap. That makes my cheap friends look like big spenders. Just no.", "Get the feeling people are not reading the whole story here.", "Exactly this. Why is this ending up so complicated!?!? You host, you expect to cook and foot the bill. End of story.", "Why do these mother\u2019s always stand for the drama Queen?", "Sounds like the non-vegan one is the unnecessary one. Pretty obvious, really.", "If is isn't personal, it's misogyny.", "Bruh. So your reasoning is you told your brother it wouldn't matter if you were included or not. Bruh.", "I wish your brother wasn't a jerk because id just Zelle you the money for your dish, but he doesn't deserve the satisfaction.", "Makes me wonder if he\u2019s not as well off as he pretends.", "My 79 year old mother can\u2019t do grocery shopping on her own anymore so I do it for her. If she doesn\u2019t insist on handing me cash before I leave, then she demands to see every receipt when I return so she can pay me back. I can easily afford to help her with groceries but her reaction is the same as your dad\u2019s.", "That one was like... lunacy. Booking an air b and b for Xmas dinner and buying a whole plater set for it brand new??? She had to have been panic out of her mind planning it was crazy.", "Oh, I think her brother is beyond being in training, he\u2019s a miser.  Notice the wife hasn\u2019t been mentioned.  Can you imagine being married to this man?", "Absolutely agree.  I would pitch in too.  But what really needed to happen is everyone needs to stand up to your brother and tell him you will be making the originally planned dinner, with generous portions for everyone because it's a holiday and with your special dish and he needs to get psychologically comfortable with paying for things like a big boy.  He has the money.  NTA", "That\u2019s sooo crazy!", ">\\[Info\\] has your brother ever been visited by three ghosts?\n\nBAHAHAHA... thank goodness I wasn't drinking a beverage when I read that!", "OP needs to cook, there is no way her brother would make her food for her. Or he'd lie about it being vegan to punish her. She can't trust him with her food.", "Yeah she would have to cook regardless. But at least then she\u2019d just be cooking for herself. Or they\u2019d all be pitching in.", "NTA I\u2019m amazed he\u2019s getting worked up over one single dish.", "NTA, your brother fucked around and found out.  I would just assume Christmas is off until you can pay for your own meal or it is at your parents house.  It is sad but your brother is to blame not you.", "NTA. I'm guessing you're vegetarian or vegan and bro has an issue with this? Not your problem. You don't get to dictate someone else's diet on holidays.\n\nAlso, I think it is an elegant solution. They want you to cook the meal and also for you to not be able to eat it. That's absolutely shitty.", "NTA. This is what I dislike about Christmas -- the societal idea that one must go into debt, regret one's life situation (which might be fine for the other 11 months of the year), and emphasize the haves vs the have nots. Attending the family Christmas celebration should be about family getting together. There should be no price of admission (even if its bickering over a given dish). If you make the decision not to attend the family get-together because you can't afford it, you might regret having made such a decision for that reason alone.", "That\u2018s why I sometimes hate the holidays... NTA.", "NTA - Your brother is an AH expecting you to do all the cooking for them that you can't eat, where does he get off treating you like this, has he always been this nasty when it comes to you....It's one thing to be frugal it's another thing to expect the person cooking to make the sacrifices.", "You're not the a******you're going to be okay make something for yourself to eat in your own house and celebrate Christmas with your mom your brother needs to grow up", "How nice for people to be privileged enough to not worry about holiday food budgets. Your bro needs to check himself in that regard. I'm 35 years old and there is NO way I would be able to afford to fund a christmas dinner with my family.\nNta, whatsoever.", "NTA it is a holiday that your family gets together once a year. Does he realize how blessed he is to have a family that wants to be together?  If he cannot make a sacrifice for one meal a year he is definitely the AH.", "NTA your brother was trying to be mean as fuck and exclude you \"its something most of us wouldnt eat\" yeah you asshole because its what OP eats! reading this just made me mad, and im glad your grandmother had your back the year before, hes being spiteful. why? who knows but its definitely on purpose to fuck with you. hes mad everybody sees him for who he is.", "You mentioned in your comments that the amount of money your special dish costs is $5-$6! If that really is the case, and your brother really is that much of a wanker, why wouldn't you just pay for it yourself? If you really can't afford $6, you could take up the generous offers from our fellow redditors to PayPal you the cash, or let your parents pay the extra few $... I suspect the dish costs more than you are letting on, or that you're being a bit of a drama queen and stirring up 'unnecessary drama' - sorry OP, for those reasons it's a soft YTA from me!", "I saw in another comment how much money your brother would be saving by cutting out the dish that is for you, its less than a coffee at Starbucks. A HUGE NTA for having a spine. That you cook the whole meal (for free!!) and he couldn't be bothered to drop literal pocket change so you would be sure to having a filling meal says everything you need to know about what your brother thinks of you. I hope you enjoy your extra special holiday with your mom free of the true Drama Llama in your family.\n\nEdited: \"was\" to \"saw\"", "No my diet is not an issue for him. He is more than happy to eat vegan food if someone prepares it for him. For him I think this is mainly about the money (for him about $3 extra due to my side) For me it is more about how he treats me", "To your edit: it\u2019s not your place to tell people who to donate their money to. Everyone is aware shelters and food banks exist, genius.", "So what you are telling us is he is frugal and lacks the intelligence to understand his treatment is innaprorpriate since you are paying(with your time) for a diner you can\u2019t eat", "honest question why are trying to defend him? you literally said he did the exact same thing last year and granny had to gather him. he IS excluding you. why are you ignoring that or trying to justify it?", "I know it\u2019s not my place and if you read my edit carefully you\u2019ll notice that I did not tell anyone to do anything with their money. I only asked them to consider their options if they wanted to donate some money this Christmas. \n\nBut I\u2019m glad you are aware of those places in case you ever feel the need to donate.\n\nHappy holidays to you! :)", "no need to be an asshole, go touch some grass", "Was this necessary?", "That makes him the asshole.  So he realizes he is screwing you over he doesn\u2019t care because there is money involved with the food.", "Is this like $300 caviar that you had in for your meal?  I mean common.", "I have a weird family where they resent me because I went to university and did well for myself. They act like I\u2019m too good for them even though I\u2019ve never done anything to make them feel that way but they think the fact I\u2019m vegan and try to help the environment means I am just trying to be better then them. \n\nI\u2019ve just gone LC and I love my life peacefully avoiding the drama", "No not about caviar. My side dish for him would cost about $3 extra", "That\u2019s the only way you can deal with dysfunctional families.

I repressed a lot of my feelings growing up since my mom was a single mother but she pushed my to work from an early age and I gave all my money to support my family. \n\nLuckily my wife helped me see that how they were treating me was wrong and I slowly grew and distanced myself. Only reason I\u2019m not NC is because I\u2019m her only son and I just feel too guilty to totally cut them off", "It was only when I described my husband\u2019s obnoxious driving behavior as \u201cemotional\u201d that he started to improve. They should teach girls this in high school.", "Why was I downvoted? I'm surprised someone was willing to help OP", "I am saying it is BOTH of their hill to die on. I passed no judgment on whether or not OP is being an a-hole here. Not that it matters, but my upvote went to NTA.\n\nIt's amusing to me though, that in this thread, OP is being praised for expecting her family to foot the entire bill (her own personal food that no one else will eat included), in exchange for the labour; meanwhile other posts in this same sub are calling OP the a-hole for hosting dinner & expecting family to pay to attend.\n\nI'm not saying either perspective is right. I'm not saying OP is wrong either. But she IS choosing that hill to die on, just as much as her brother is.", "Right?! Going to the store to buy the ingredients takes what? An hour at most? Cooking takes a minimum of three hours and honestly probably significantly longer. It\u2019s not even like OP is being stingy (like her rude brother), she literally can\u2019t afford to contribute.", "I tried for years to cut my mother out but she would start calling my in laws so that never worked. People I worked with would answer my phone and I say I wasn\u2019t at my desk when she was in a rant.  She passed 11 yrs ago and it was a relief.  So many things came out after."]}
