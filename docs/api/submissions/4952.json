Last year was the first year we spent it at my brother (20s) and his wife (20s). Due to it being their first time, they were understandably very stressed and had troubles getting things together especially taking into account my dietary restrictions.\n\nLast year I (F20s) didn\u2019t live in the same city as them so I couldn\u2019t really help with the preparations but this year I do. Since I\u2019m a student the money is tight but my brother and sil earn extremely well even compared to our parents. When we spent the Christmas at our parents we didn\u2019t have to contribute financially towards the feast but this year the cost are shared by our parents and them. As I can\u2019t afford it my compensation is the organization and cooking the feast as none of them enjoy such things. This is not a small task since I\u2019ll have to start the preparations days before Christmas and do everything on my own.\n\nHowever, since I\u2019m not the one paying for the meal I have shared my plans weeks ago with all of them and they have agreed on the menu. Couple days ago I sat down and calculated how much all of this would cost and sent the info to my family. This did not go down well with my brother.\n\nHe is extremely frugal which is fine and all but the cost of the feast is the same as it has been every year. Mind you, it is nothing crazy honestly but costs more than a regular everyday meal. \n\nI said fine we can cut something back if he wants and asked what he wanted to give up. He chose the one thing I wanted to make for myself as a treat since almost everything else is something I can\u2019t eat but the rest of them can eat all of it. I said okay anything else but he didn\u2019t want to give up anything else. I asked him if he was serious that \u201dmy dish\u201d would be the only one we would get rid off and not one of their multiple sides. I don\u2019t want to eat only potatoes and salad.\n\nHis response was that it\u2019s all so expensive and since it\u2019s something that most of us wouldn\u2019t eat it didn\u2019t make sense to make it. My brother pulled the same move last year and my mother put her foot down and forced my brother to include me. Since then he has constantly told us \u201dhow we are so emotional and stir up unnecessary drama\u201d\n\nSo to his opinion I said that it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just not attend and spent the Christmas by myself since I can\u2019t afford to pay for the dish since I already provide my main\n\nMy brother got mad and said that it\u2019s not what he meant.\n\nI replied that this would be the most elegant solution to the problem since the feast would be cheaper and I wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard for a meal I can\u2019t eat. And this would have the added bonus of not causing  too much drama since I\u2019d do so voluntarily (I know I\u2019m probably an ah just for this)\n\nHe got super mad at me while my mother got mad at him and decided to spend the Christmas at my place. Now everyone is mad at everyone but honestly I\u2019m mainly just sad and feel like I ruined everyone\u2019s Christmas.

Our family was huge until I was in my 30s. (then parents, grandparents, great grandparents died,  others moved away).  It was never ever even a moment's blip for our family.  NOBODY wanted any one person to have to struggle with food prep.  We ALWAYS did a covered dish thing.  It was never even a question.  It was just the natural response.

So toxic.", "NTA, from my take, they know you are vegan, have been for years, and the additional costs are only $5-6! That is a ridiculously small amount of money for your brother to take a stand on when it means deliberately excluding you from eating. He is well aware that you don\u2019t have the money yourself and has already agreed to help foot the costs. And you are doing all the work cooking! This is a stupid hill for him to die on. If I had someone offering to do all the cooking for me I\u2019d be glad to throw in a little extra money. The cooking is the hard part.

What about his IL\u2019s? Did they contribute too? Because this sounds like your bro and his wife were wanting someone else to do the heavy lifting. And you didn\u2019t play along.

You had all arrived at a democratic solution weeks ago, your brother's reaction this week was miserly, and your response was reasonable, given that you are paying for your own main, and would be left with potatoes and salad while everyone else enjoyed a feast that you labored over for days.

If the issue is truly the cost (and could be since you don't actually know their whole financial situation), good manners alone dictate that he not choose to cut the one thing you prepare for yourself.

The dish you want to cut, is the only one that I am preparing to suit my needs. We can cut the similar dish rather than have 2 versions of it if you want. But cutting mine is not negotiable.\" He can argue but presumably since you are doing the cooking, you will also be doing the grocery shopping.  Or at least making the grocery list.  Your mother should probably not gotten involved at all other than to possibly point out that your brother was not the sole decision maker for a family meal unless he was covering all of the costs, doing the grocery shopping and preparing the meal.  Ultimately, as personal as food is and no matter how much we attach meaning to traditions, one dish should not \"ruin\" Christmas for anyone. You saying you just wouldn't come to Christmas and taking a victim stance is manipulative  and contributed to the drama.  Apologize for that, state that you will be cooking your dish and can cut the other one to save some of the costs and that if anyone would prefer a different dish be cut instead (other than the one you are making for yourself), this is the time to speak up. And then stand your ground. Standing your ground is merely repeating, \"Since I am contributing to the meal by cooking and that is a major contribution, I will make my favorite. That's not negotiable.\" Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Then your brother can either agree or cough up 1/2 the money for one dish. I can't imagine the savings are significant only cutting out one item, so the whole argument seems completely pointless.", "NTA.

Why can't they eat the leftovers as you already cooked them? \n\nThey're using you. They want a cushy holiday that they don't have to cook for and because you don't have any money they're using that as an excuse to make you do all this work. If you work this out and end up doing Christmas there, I hope you put your foot down and say you won't do the leftovers cooking. \n\nLet me put this in a slightly different perspective for you that you may not have considered. Your budget is $200. I'm not sure whether your brother is paying all of this or if your parents chip in for this too. \n\n* If your parents aren't splitting it and it would just be your half and your brothers half, it would be $100 each.\n* If you all three parts of the family were able to pitch in evenly, you'd each be responsible for $66. \n* If it was split evenly across the number of people eating (sounds like 5 people), that would be $40 each. \n\nPersonally, I think the last one is the one we should be going by since you are one person and the other family units are each 2 people and you obviously aren't going to enjoy as much of the food as they are. Since your family/brother likes to break things down so it's even, this only seems fair. \n\nYou are contributing WAY, WAY, WAY more than $40 worth of effort. Frankly, you're putting in way more than even $100 worth of effort. How many hours do you put into this? I'm guessing a lot. I cook my family dinners too and it usually an entire day just for the cooking.\n\nYour brother is acting like the cost of the food is the only piece that has value here. I realize the point of you cooking is so you can pitch in some value yourself, but it has to be balanced. And now that he is for bidding you a SIX DOLLAR MEAL (unbelievable), I am certain he is just taking advantage of you. \n\nYour brother is only looking at the specific monitary value that his money adds and is completely ignoring the value that your efforts bring. \n\nWhat would happen if you did have that $40-$100 to contribute? How would you divvy up the cooking then? Presumably you'd do 1/3 or 1/2 of the cooking in that situation. You're only responsible for contributing what you can't. You don't have to match that entire $200 value. \n\n**You're only responsible for the piece you can't afford since you're brother is responsible for his portion of the contribution regardless of that.** \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to sit down and think about how much your time and effort to plan, budget, shop, and cook all this food is worth. Is it minimum wage? Is it more than minimum wage? For a $40 contribution, anything over 5 1/2 hours is putting in more than a mimimum wage worth of effort. And you are obviously worth way more than that. \n\nI know it sucks to reduce this to nickels and dimes, but your brother is asking for it when he refuses to pay for your $6 side.", ">My main is not included in the budget but theirs is which is about 30% of the budget.\n\nAlso, stop allowing this. You are family! If their main is included, your main should be included. The whole point is that you are doing the cooking as your part of a FAMILY MEAL. If they can't include your meal as part of the family meal then there is no reason you should be cooking for them at all.\n\nIf you are expected to do 100% of the planning, shopping, and cooking, then your brother is expected to pitch in 100% of the costs. If he's not willing to do that, then he needs to pitch in and cook some of the food to match the amounts you are putting in, just like you are cooking to match the amounts he puts in. That is the only way it is fair.\n\nRight now the way your family is going about it, when he pays for the food, you have to cook it. When you pay for the food, you also have to cook it. How is that fair?", "Sorry for the multiple replies, but I am still trying to figure out how your family came to this arrangement and decided it was fair.\n\nI can't get over the fact that your brother is contributing $200 to feed himself, his wife and your parents, thinks your food somehow doesn't make it into the budget, and yet you're the one that is doing all the cooking.\n\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your brother.\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your SIL\n* You're cooking the food he paid for that is for your parents\n* You're cooking the food YOU PAID FOR that is for you.\n\nI'm sorry, this arrangement is completely unfair.

At this point, you will have done what you can do as a course correction and it is up to your brother to meet you halfway. He can be gracious and accept the compromise or he can continue to argue. If he continues to argue, it is perfectly acceptable to say, \"I appreciate your financial concerns and ask you to think about my contribution too. Although I am not contributing monetarily, I am contributing a significant amount of time and effort and that has value.  As a contributor, I insist that this dish be included.

There\u2019s 5 of us in total", "I have explained in other replies but yes it is too much for me at the moment. I\u2019m careful with my money and budget but sometimes life just happens and unexpected costs appear that can drain your savings. And before you ask, my unexpected costs were medical so they were very necessary.\n\nBut in the end, for me this is not about the dollar amount. I just gave the sum since people felt like they needed it to make a fair judgement.", "I haven't attended a family meal as an adult where I haven't contributed at least one dish.  It's called being an adult.", "I understand. I have had years where a difference of a dollar or three was of immense impact. A lot of people have never had the blessing (in disguise) of that experience", "For sure. The problem is not the expectation to contribute in some way- the problem is the demanding and unreasonable way OPs brother calculates the \"value\" of those contributions. \n\nHe knows OP doesn't have to money to contribute up to his specifications, so she's contributing labor instead. And according to him the value of that labor does not amount to the extra $5-6 required to include her preferred dish. That's unhinged."]}
