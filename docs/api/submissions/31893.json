Let\u2019s call it Villa Como. A night stay at a room in the villa for 2 people run north of $650 (this will be important later). In the beginning of the planning stage, we had hoped for an intimate wedding with only our closest family and friends. Due to the low guest count, we decided to pay for everyone\u2019s hotel stay as a way to thank our guests for flying all the way to Italy. \n\nI met up with one of my friends Kara (32f) for dinner, and verbally invited her. I mentioned that everything is still in the early stage of planning and that (at that time) we haven\u2019t even come to a final decision about the venue yet. I did told her that we really wanted to do it at Villa Como. I also told her that since only a small number of guests will come, we wanted to do something nice for our guests and provide a hotel stay for everyone the night of the wedding. She told me that was incredibly nice of us, as usually the bride and groom don\u2019t pay for guests\u2019 lodging.\n\nAs we started inviting people, we find our guests count growing to almost triple what we had planned for. Considering the guest count, we didn\u2019t think it would be sensible to provide everyone a night stay at Villa Como as it would have cost us more than $30,000. We still wanted to provide a hotel stay for everyone, so we went to find a cheaper hotel nearby. This hotel we booked is a nice 4* hotel. Granted it is not as luxurious as Villa Como, but it has decent amenities like pools, Jacuzzis and an inclusive Italian breakfast spread. We decided to use the rooms that we\u2019ve booked at Villa Como for close family members like our parents, siblings and grandparents.\n\nWhen I hung out with Kara again, I showed her the hotel that we booked and told her that we\u2019ll be chartering cars with drivers to take care of everyone\u2019s transportation. Her only response was, \u201cSo I won\u2019t be staying at Villa Como?\u201d I explained to her everything. She then started to say things like, \u201cwell, if you and your family wanted to invite more people then you should have been prepared to provide everyone a stay at Villa Como\u201d. Throughout the night, she made multiple offhand comments about how bummed she was and how she \u201cwas already so excited to stay at Villa Como!\u201d\n\nI understand that she has to travel (14 hours flight from the US) and pay for her flights. But I never pressured her or anyone to come to the wedding.\n\nMy mom said maybe we should just pay for Kara\u2019s stay at Villa Como as I had already got her hopes up. My sister thinks that Kara should understand that wedding plans change (especially as Kara knew I was still very early in our wedding planning when I first told her). She thinks that Kara should be grateful that we\u2019re providing her a hotel stay at all and that if she really wanted to stay at Villa Como, she can pay for it herself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701129676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185i0c0/aitah_for_downgrading_the_guests_accommodation/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is correct.", "Nta.  If the hotel was the reason she was coming she should stay home...can I get her spot?  Sounds like an amazing time.", "NTA and your sister is right. \n\nThe only compromise I\u2019d be willing to offer here is telling Kara you\u2019re covering $xx for the hotel rooms, and that if she\u2019d like to pay the difference to book the fancier hotel on her own, she\u2019s welcome to do so. But tell her she needs to book it on her own, and you\u2019ll help pay the agreed on portion to the hotel when you\u2019re there, since I\u2019d bet money she\u2019ll run up plenty of room charges on your bill otherwise. Suddenly she may be perfectly happy with the four star place. \n\nThat said, have you specified to group sales at the guest hotel whether your guests are/are not allowed to charge things to the room during their stay? I\u2019d make it clear additional charges are to require separate payments. Someone, whether Kara or someone else, may take advantage of your generosity unless ground rules are clear from the start.", "NTA, and I'd uninvite her. She doesn't care about your wedding, she just wants the accomodation.", "I'm going with NTA.\n\nKara is a potential AH, depending on how far she is pushing this. I do think its reasonable for her to bummed, and its reasonable for her to briefly vocalize that disappointment and lightly call you out. But beyond an initial comment, she should be dropping it and moving on. If she is continuing to harp on this moving forward, she is definitely the AH.\n\nAs far as your behavior - its not AH territory, but I'd say you did make a small mistake. Don't dangle premature offers to people - especially expensive ones - if you aren't making concrete plans to deliver. Its just a recipe for disappointment.", "Holy fuck the entitlement some people have. Fucking Kara man. NTA.", "NTA, she's not entitled to that hotel and it's already a pretty big gesture to pay for everyone's hotel for the wedding. \n\nCan I get her spot? Lake Como is only 2 hours from London ;)", "NTA \u2014 your sister is right and Kara is a leech :(", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound from the post that OP promised anyone a room a Villa Como\u2026 just that they wanted to just have the wedding itself there. Plus, they reserved a small number of rooms.\n\nKara sounds pretty entitled.", "NTA. But I hope you learned to keep your mouth closed", "Nta, but you really should have just kept it nice and small and invite only the few people you originally wanted to. Because the more people you invite the more I'm going to think it's a vacation and they want the great hotel on you. If she's that unhappy but where she's staying you are correct she can pay for the upgrade herself or not come.", "You are providing a 4* hotel accommodation for your guests and arranging for chartered vehicles to the wedding venue. It\u2019s really thoughtful and courteous of you to do that.\n\nKara is really entitled and is trying to take advantage of you. Don\u2019t give in. She can take this offer or leave it. NTA", "NTA - Kara sounds like a little entitled brat and should just be happy to get a free stay while attending her friend\u2019s wedding.", "Kara can stuff it. You're NTA and overly generous. It's your (and your fiance's) show; you run it how you see fit, period... especially if you're paying.", "ESH - regarding Kara, I agree that she is being rather fussy by complaining about not provided extremely expensive accommodation when what she is being provided sounds more than comfortable.\n\nI\u2019m not letting the OP off the hook either.  The modern trend for luxury destination weddings is extremely expensive for guests who are often expected to fund flights and / or accommodation.  It is rather selfish to expect all these guests to fly themselves to Italy at great expense.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure you want to spend money on accommodations for someone who has already told you she will find them unacceptable? \n\nI sure wouldn't.", "Kara sounds like a party pooper.

This does not apply to weddings where one spouse has a large amount of family somewhere, and others have to travel there.
