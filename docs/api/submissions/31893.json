In the beginning of the planning stage, we had hoped for an intimate wedding with only our closest family and friends. Due to the low guest count, we decided to pay for everyone\u2019s hotel stay as a way to thank our guests for flying all the way to Italy. \n\nI met up with one of my friends Kara (32f) for dinner, and verbally invited her. I mentioned that everything is still in the early stage of planning and that (at that time) we haven\u2019t even come to a final decision about the venue yet. I did told her that we really wanted to do it at Villa Como. I also told her that since only a small number of guests will come, we wanted to do something nice for our guests and provide a hotel stay for everyone the night of the wedding. She told me that was incredibly nice of us, as usually the bride and groom don\u2019t pay for guests\u2019 lodging.\n\nAs we started inviting people, we find our guests count growing to almost triple what we had planned for. Considering the guest count, we didn\u2019t think it would be sensible to provide everyone a night stay at Villa Como as it would have cost us more than $30,000. We still wanted to provide a hotel stay for everyone, so we went to find a cheaper hotel nearby. This hotel we booked is a nice 4* hotel. Granted it is not as luxurious as Villa Como, but it has decent amenities like pools, Jacuzzis and an inclusive Italian breakfast spread. We decided to use the rooms that we\u2019ve booked at Villa Como for close family members like our parents, siblings and grandparents.\n\nWhen I hung out with Kara again, I showed her the hotel that we booked and told her that we\u2019ll be chartering cars with drivers to take care of everyone\u2019s transportation. Her only response was, \u201cSo I won\u2019t be staying at Villa Como?\u201d I explained to her everything. She then started to say things like, \u201cwell, if you and your family wanted to invite more people then you should have been prepared to provide everyone a stay at Villa Como\u201d. Throughout the night, she made multiple offhand comments about how bummed she was and how she \u201cwas already so excited to stay at Villa Como!\u201d\n\nI understand that she has to travel (14 hours flight from the US) and pay for her flights. But I never pressured her or anyone to come to the wedding.\n\nMy mom said maybe we should just pay for Kara\u2019s stay at Villa Como as I had already got her hopes up. My sister thinks that Kara should understand that wedding plans change (especially as Kara knew I was still very early in our wedding planning when I first told her). She thinks that Kara should be grateful that we\u2019re providing her a hotel stay at all and that if she really wanted to stay at Villa Como, she can pay for it herself.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701129676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185i0c0/aitah_for_downgrading_the_guests_accommodation/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not have mentioned paying for rooms until you had a guest count, so I think this is one of those times that you admit you made a mistake and tell people they can stay where you can afford to pay or they can pay for themselves.", "We bypassed \"potential AH\" territory when Kara made the second comment about not staying at a certain hotel.", "Yes you\u2019re correct. I should\u2019ve specified it on the post. She asked me about where the venue will be and I told her that I really want to do it at Villa Como. She then asked about the logistics of the wedding (where everyone are staying and stuff) and I told her that I\u2019m thinking of providing \u201ca hotel stay\u201d, not \u201ca hotel stay at Villa Como\u201d. I also clarified with her that everything was still in early planning and I\u2019d update her again once we nailed everything down. \n\nAnd I actually didn\u2019t tell anyone else about us providing a room, other than Kara (because she asked about the logistics) and another friend of mine whom I needed to invite much earlier due her personal situation.\n\nFor the other guests, I told them about the hotel stay after they\u2019ve RSVPed (after I\u2019ve arranged for the 4* hotel).", "Short answer is our parents (who are helping us pay part of the wedding). But it is not as easy to blame them because they\u2019re also in a tough position. It is hard to explain without going into details, but basically the guest count increase is coming mainly from family we did not want to invite. There are family dramas and arrangements behind that. We didn't invite the extra guests but we also can't do anything about it (believe me, we tried everything short of jeopardizing our chance of having any decent relationship with our family).", "Yup so that was also our consideration, that people will be extending our stay. That\u2019s why (I also mentioned this in another comment) we offered everyone the option to either stay at the hotel we booked or we\u2019ll give them cash of the same amount as the nightly rate of that hotel which they can use towards any other hotels of their choice.\n\nWe didn\u2019t separate the guests to two groups. Only our immediate family members (parents, grandparents and our siblings) are staying at Villa Como. Our parents are also chipping in for this stay. All of our guests got the exact same hotel offer.\n\nI actually don\u2019t think Kara is coming only for the hotel. She is coming with our mutual friend, and I do believe she is coming for the wedding.\n\nAs for the guests count, it is hard to explain without going into details, but basically the guest count increase is coming mainly from family we did not want to invite. There are family dramas and arrangements behind that. We didn\u2019t invite the extra guests but we also can\u2019t do anything about it (believe me, we tried everything short of jeopardizing our chance of having any decent relationship with our family).\n\nI was honest with Kara about all these and told her that it\u2019s not financially sensible for us to provide a stay at Villa Como for everyone.", "Y\u2019all are so weird - I know you guys are the type of friends who want free shit and get mad when it\u2019s not handed to you \ud83d\ude2d", "Literally who said they\u2019re forcing people to come?
