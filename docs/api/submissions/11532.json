Is she trying to teach the child to share, control portions, etc.  if it\u2019s just that she always wants what the kid is having, and this annoys you, then I\u2019d just stop buying treats or take the kid out for ice cream without the parent.", "NTA and I\u2019m not sure why people think you are. If it was any other \u201cgift\u201d ie a tv/laptop/gaming console? They\u2019d think the parent WAS the AH if it was mainly used by the parent or the child was pressured into giving it to the parent.\n\nFact is? People seem to forget that food is also a gift. Especially in the context you are giving it to the child. The mother is being selfish and entitled. Especially after giving the go ahead, saying she doesn\u2019t want any and never explaining a \u201creason\u201d for doing it.", "NTA Buy her food and drink anyway even though she says no. That way each of them have their own meal.", "NTA. But maybe try to buy extra / larger portions just so she can have some while leaving enough for her kid?", "NTA, but I don't think there's anything you can do. It sounds like neurotic behavior on her part. Either a) she cannot control her urges when she sees junk food (issues with eating behavior), or b) she is trying to control the child, like showing her ability to access the child's food and claim it for herself, not allowing him his own \"personal food space\". She may even not realize whether she does it, or why.\n\nThere was an AITA here a while back about a girlfriend who would always grab stuff from the boyfriend's plate, EVEN if she had exact same things on her plate in front of her. Your story reminded me of that.\n\nI'm afraid this calls for therapy, especially if the child is upset by that, but apart from gently suggesting discussing it to your friend or arranging it so that the child gets to eat it up before the mom is there, I really don't see how you can affect any of that.\n\n*Edit to add:* I read in other comments that she knows that the child is autistic and is uncomfortable about sharing parts of food, straws, etc., and she eats more than a half, this is definitely her having behavior issues. If she knows she's making the child uncomfortable, I'd file it under child abuse in my book. (I'm autistic and my child is, too.) This colors everything in much worse light.", "I get what you are saying. I think these other people don\u2019t.  The parent asking is encroaching on her son\u2019s food.  Does not matter what it is - drinks, burgers, healthy snacks.  My husband did this.  I don\u2019t like my food touched and neither do my kids.  My youngest son would quit eating or drinking whatever has been touched and it was ruined for him.  I\u2019m the same.  We finally told him NO.  We don\u2019t share.  When we\u2019re done with our portion, you can have it but not before.  Once we set those boundaries, it\u2019s worked for all of us.  My husband did not see a problem until we explained that it ruins the food for us.", "NTA, talk to her. Explain that if she is hungry you will buy extra but you feel annoyed she eats her childs potion", "My mom does this with desserts, but respects when we say no. She says it's because she wants just a small bite, not the whole thing. I think it's her strange version of portion control? Like just order the whole thing yourself once in awhile, dangit! \n\nThat said, if we don't feel like sharing, we tell her she should just order her own instead of vulturing off ours. We laugh and she decides whether or not to order her own.", " Some parents seem to like eating their kid's food, for some reason, and there's not a lot you can do to stop that when you're not there. Her house, her rules. Just buy an extra portion of chips or whatever for her and hope that does the trick.", "NTA but maybe she has an ulterior reason for eating child\u2019s food. If it primarily junk food you like to buy for child maybe she doesn\u2019t want to upset you but doesn\u2019t want child eating too much junk food. My SIL does it with nephew when my parents give him cookies or ice cream and has already had a lot and will refuse dinner she will ask him for a bite so parents don\u2019t have to say no to giving him a cookie and he is still happy he got the treat. Maybe have a conversation with friend and ask the reason she does this and come up with a solution together", "It sounds like maybe she's trying to desensitize him to having other people eat his food. If it's as disgusting to you both as you say, then she's parenting by trying to help him adapt in small steps. This could be something she's been advised to do or does to support him.\n\nAlso, the number of calories/amount of fat in fast food is horrifying. Perhaps she's trying to reduce the amount he eats without hurting your feelings about the gift you're getting for him, or she doesn't want to eat a full meal because she doesn't want the calories but she'd like a taste.\n\nNAH but maybe have a non judgemental chat with her about why she does it and explain that it upsets you because you don't understand.", "Ehh NAH because she might just be controlling her child\u2019s portions abcs in the end how she takes care of her child is her business.
