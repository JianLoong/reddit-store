BIL has continued to message me about if I\u2019m gonna get back to his friend or not, to the point where I got suspicious that it was him not a 3rd person. He was just too invested. Last night confirmed this though cause he said \u201cif you don\u2019t wanna add my friend just send me the nudes and I\u2019ll send em\u201d I told him no and he said his friend wants to know what would happen if he sent me $100 on cash app. I told him not to because its not gonna mean I owe him anything and I\u2019m gonna spend it. Right after I said that I got $100 from a random cash app. Now BIL has been texting me every 20 min about if I\u2019m gonna send a pic to his friend or if I just wanna send it to him. Finally he understood it wasn\u2019t gonna happen and now he\u2019s harassing me for his \u201cfriends\u201d money back.

They live down the street and he doesn\u2019t do right by his family so they rely on our house for food a lot of nights, hot water, clean laundry. How I know it\u2019s him also is because he got paid last night so I know he had the money to send cause once he gets paid he blows his check on whatever. I have blocked him on Snapchat since that\u2019s mostly what he was sending weird stuff on and since I told him that my husband knows everything he hasn\u2019t messaged me again. I really don\u2019t know where to go from here but I just needed to know if it was wrong of me to wanna keep the money still lmao. I mostly feel like an asshole I think because like I mentioned he doesn\u2019t spend it on his family so I know he was spending it on nudes instead of diapers and milk.

Stay away from with a ten foot pole and NEVER be alone with him. NEVER EVER no matter what. He is your husbands brother so you are bound to meet him avoid it at all cost. Be ready for backlash from your husbands family cuz I belive the worst in people so they might just call you a Xxxx or ask you did you do something to let this on.
