Now had you said \"Shut the door you stupid moron can't you see I've got coolant out???\" then of course you would be an asshole. But from her view she was just going about her day and all of the sudden someone is screaming commands at her. I think she is overreacting and blowing things out of proportion but still, that isn't pleasant and chances are you could have taken a better tone. I would just say \"I'm sorry that I shouted so aggressively, I just got really panicked I didn't mean any harm\" and in an ideal world she would then say \"Thank you, and I'm sorry blew this so out of proportion that you felt the need to ask the internet, I should have realized your tone was just about concern for puppy\" and you both continue on about your day.

It's like yelling at a child for trying to stick a hand on the stove burner, you're not an asshole for doing it that way in the moment (because it's a highly dangerous action) but if you're TA for not explaining why afterwards depends on how much she actually understood the danger she was putting your furry friend in.", "Not just lethal for dogs, it is lethal for humans too.\n\nIt takes a surprisingly low amount to kill anything.", "Because she needs something to be angry about."]}
