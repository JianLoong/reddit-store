This also applies to children who model and do voice work.*\r  \n\r  \n*The law is named after former child actor Jackie Coogan. In the 1920s, Coogan became one of the first child stars in America and earned millions of dollars. When he became an adult, he discovered his parents had spent most of his money. Coogan battled his mother in court and was able to recover a small portion of his earnings, and the legal battle resulted in the 1939 enactment of the California Child Actor\u2019s Bill. Among requirements for schooling and limiting working hours, the bill requires that a child actor\u2019s employer set aside 15% of the actor\u2019s earnings in a trust.*", "I think you need /r/legaladvice \\- and an actual attorney - more than you need this forum. \n\nIn terms of the AH-ness, NTA for considering or even taking legal action to secure the money you are owed. I do not know how the legalities work of course. You would also need to consider specific circumstances relevant here - do you know why she spent it, or on what? Is she open to any discussions about repayment? Are you willing to cut this relationship out of your life permanently, as that's a likely outcome if you bring legal action against her?", "NTA. She was wrong to spend *your* savings. \n\nI'd sue her. Make sure that any/all communication with her is via email or text, so it's all recorded.

No idea what the law is here.\n\nDoes she actually have the money? No point suing her unless you can actually get the money.", "nta if you decide to sue. This is not uncommon for parents to keep money that the children earned like that. Yes, it will affect your relationship, but I suspect it will no matter what because of the bitterness you likely feel over what she has done. You can decide not to sue her as well, but the question wasn't whether or not to sue, but if you'd be the ah if you do.", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer, then decide. As other's have said, even if you win the judgement, you may not get anything. So talk to a lawyer, figure out the possible outcomes and decide if you can achieve the outcome you are seeking.\n\nI don't know your particular situation, but you may be entitled to back child support based on her actions and custody agreements.\n\nStart with a lawyer, go from there.", "NTA. Your mother stole what was rightfully yours.  I figure if you sue her, you're going to need some of the money from the investments to fund any legal action against her, so you'll need to sort that with your dad (hopefully those investments have made more money for you), but do go ahead and get back what was yours from the get-go.  She had no right to spend that money, and the fact that she's refusing to repay any of it, shows clear lack of respect for you, and clear disregard for her actions.", "If you decide to sue, I think most people will understand\n\nThe people who won't are the kind of people who would steal 50K from their child without any kind of remorse.\n\nOther than that, the truth is...your relationship with your mother is likely never going to recover from this. \n\nShe's a thief and a liar.\n\nIf you do nothing, you'll never trust her again and likely won't have much of a relationship with her given that she is a thief and a liar and has no problems fucking you over if it makes her life easier\n\nIf you sue, you'll likely never have a relationship with her ever again.\n\nThen of course you'll have to deal with all the people who call you heartless and cruel and blah blah blah\n\n\nSo what you have to do is decide if you are ok with your mother's entire side of the family creating all kinds of drama in your life.

And to me, that makes suing her warranted\n\nMe personally...I'd get the money.  I'd never trust my mom again if she did what yours did.  So there wouldn't be a relationship moving forward.

You didn\u2019t start this conflict: your mother committed a crime by stealing, and you happen to be the victim. Taking her to court will negatively affect your relationship, but it\u2019s entirely your mother\u2019s fault. So, if you\u2019re asking for judgement on your motives, you\u2019re definitely not the asshole for wanting her to be held accountable. But, that\u2019s the only help we can give you. Go forth guilt-free and find yourself a good lawyer.", "Guess it depends on whether the relationship or the money is more important.  You have every right to sue for what it rightfully yours and you wouldn't be the asshole for it, but in doing so the relationship may not survive it - that also wouldn't be your fault considering your mother is the one that spent your money and tried lying about it.

Did she use the money for your benefit, i.e. school, activities, etc.?  Was your dad paying adequate and timely child support or did she need the money for basics to feed and house you?  You'd have to find a lawyer that specializes in this field and get a consult to find out what the laws in your area are regarding use of the money for your 'upkeep'.  Keep in mind that it may end up costing you more, both financially and emotionally, than it's worth.  Also, if you mom doesn't have the money to give you, even if you do win a lawsuit, you may never see a dime... and still have legal bills to pay!", "NTA-\"Yet\". Once you actually sue, YATA. \n\nWhat result are you hoping for? It begs the question: are you willing to put a dollar value on your relationship with your mother, because that's what you will be exchanging for the money. \n\nDoes she have the money available, or are you going to strip her retirement fund? Are you going to empty her bank reserves? Are you now out to punish her?\n\nShe has done an injustice to you - she has failed as a mother in a basic way, by spending that which she had promised to you. I suspect that a lawsuit will never fix that problem. \n\nI also suspect that you have an uphill battle trying to recover money that you generated while a minor. Which will also be whittled away by both her and your legal costs.\n\nForgive and walk away from it. It might hurt to do that now, but you will not be happier by carrying this through to its eventual cataclysm.", "NTA,\n\nbut i doubt you would win that suit.
