Tania said nothing. I saw him do that again, run up to the table, lick something and put it back.

The same plate, I saw Nate rearranging with his fingers, touching all the food.\n\nShe kept saying \u2018Just take one, you can eat it later\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t let it go. I broke and told her that I won\u2019t eat it because Nate left his saliva all over it while playing with the food.\n\nShe got really offended, saying it was just a kid and it wasn\u2019t disgusting, and I should get over it and if she can it the food, I should be able to.\n\nI said that I am sorry, but I can\u2019t eat it and she told me to get the fuck out and don\u2019t come back without an apology.\n\nI was completely surprised.

It may not bother her because it's her kid but it's not your kid", "NTA. If she wants to eat after her kid like that it's her business but it's gross, rude, and controlling to expect you to. Communicable illnesses are a thing and I would not risk one, not even for a friend's child.", "NTA at all. Even if there wasn't a toddler playing with the food, Tania's attitude is completely wrong.

Like you I won't eat food touch by a child with \"dirty\" hands no matter how young or how cute is the toddler. It can be full of bacteria. And it's not your child. So it can be totally acceptable a mother eat food touch by the saliva of her child, but it's totally unacceptable to force a friend to do so.\nActually, it's the right moment to teach the child that he has to eat the things he touches, or if he doesn't want to eat something, he just doesn't touch it.", "NTA...Hopefully the reality of the situation will eventually sink in and they'll start being better hosts.", "Not the ahole, Tania is clueless", "Fuck her.

It\u2019s probably worse when it\u2019s a child of that age as they touch EVERYTHING and put hand in their mouth all the time.
