Basically, it was cake and some finger food.\n\nI\u2019ve been drinking my coffee and chatting when I noticed her son, Nate, run up to the table, grab some food, take a bite, then put it back on. Tania said nothing. I saw him do that again, run up to the table, lick something and put it back. Nate tends to have his hands in his mouth (I don\u2019t know, it seems like a lot of toddlers do it) and he kept grabbing food and rearranging it on the plates with his fingers that were just in his mouth.\n\nTania and her husband said nothing even thought they saw exactly what\u2019s been happening.\n\nI have to say, I was grossed out and didn\u2019t want any food. I kept my mouth shut though and said absolutely nothing, just carried on drinking my coffee and chatting away.\n\nTania kept asking if I wanted some food and cake and I tried to excuse myself saying that I wasn\u2019t hungry, but it looked delicious, etc.\n\nSadly, Tania grew frustrated with me not eating anything and became more and more pushy. She noticed that one of the other guys wasn\u2019t eating either and she got really upset. She started complaining how she slaved away in the kitchen (to be honest, and I am not trying to diminish her efforts, but majority of that was frozen finger food and sweets that she just put on the plates) and how we\u2019re ungrateful and should be polite enough to eat at least some of it.\n\nI tried my best to say nothing, but she kept holding the plate in front of me, expecting me to grab something. The same plate, I saw Nate rearranging with his fingers, touching all the food.\n\nShe kept saying \u2018Just take one, you can eat it later\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t let it go. I broke and told her that I won\u2019t eat it because Nate left his saliva all over it while playing with the food.\n\nShe got really offended, saying it was just a kid and it wasn\u2019t disgusting, and I should get over it and if she can it the food, I should be able to.\n\nI said that I am sorry, but I can\u2019t eat it and she told me to get the fuck out and don\u2019t come back without an apology.\n\nI was completely surprised. The other guys looked surprised. I just grabbed my stuff and left.

My 3yo will sometimes grab something, bite a piece of it and try to put the rest back. It's my job as a parent to teach my kid not do it and make sure it won't slobber all over the food Im serving to my guests. It's also my job to make sure the food you're getting is hygenic", "NTA at all. So weird to be that pushy about eating food after someone says they aren't hungry.  Definitely NTA.", "NTA - I understand that most parents aren't bothered by this sort of thing with their own children. But expecting anyone else to be okay with it is gross. I know the kiddo is little and doesn't understand just yet, but Tania still should have kept the food out of his reach and fixed him his own plate.", "NTA I think it was incredibly rude for Tania and her husband to let their kid touch the guests\u2019 food!

They are constantly touching things they shouldn\u2019t be and I would not want to eat anything after I watched the child touch all over it.", "NTA. I am no germaphobe but that sounds gross. Your friend should have made a plate for the toddler to play with and put the other food out of reach. Then everyone would be fine. It may not bother her because it's her kid but it's not your kid", "NTA. If she wants to eat after her kid like that it's her business but it's gross, rude, and controlling to expect you to. Communicable illnesses are a thing and I would not risk one, not even for a friend's child.", "NTA at all. Even if there wasn't a toddler playing with the food, Tania's attitude is completely wrong. I don't know why this persist in some people, but no one has a right to force anyone to eat or drink just because they spent time/money/effort into preparing it. I absolutely hate when hosts do this. \n\nThat said, the fact that they saw their child touching the food and said nothing makes them even bigger AHs. \n\nI have a son and I will very much eat food he's touched, taken a bite off, hell, sometimes I've even eaten food he had inside his mouth for a moment in the past (and yes, I understand this is super gross to some people, and I would never do it for a stranger, but it doesn't gross me out when it's my son, I don't know why, something psychological I'm sure)... But I would NEVER let him touch food that is intended for others to help themselves from! And if for some reason I had failed to parent him and he would've already touched it, I would NEVER even dream of demanding people eat that food anyway! \n\nTania needs to understand that how she feels about her child and about eating food her child touched is her own experience, and she can't possibly expect others to feel the same.", "NTA. That is just gross. The child should have had his own plate to go back and forth to pick at.", "NTA. That\u2019s disgusting (not to mention a health risk), and Tania should be keeping a better eye on her kid.", "NTA\n\nThis specific situation was gross and wrong. But you also don't need it to say no to food. I hate when people push food, the complicated mix of dietary needs, health, etc means food is complicated and no one should be demanding you eat.", "NTA\n\nThat's just nasty. Just, nope. Not worth it.\n\nLazy and entitled parenting at its finest. It's easier to get mad at you than it is to parent her child. She's unwilling to throw away contaminated food, but is perfectly happy to throw away a friendship with her best friend. That tells you more than enough about her.", "NTA\n\nYou don't let your kid touch all the food of the guests. He can do that with his own or the parents food but not the one that's for the guests, that's just unpolite.\n\nYou can show her this thread once a few people have replied.\n\nOr next time if you are really petty, put your fingers into your mouth and touch her food as well and then eat it and say, it's just saliva and if i can eat it you surely can as awell.", "NTA - It's pretty ridiculous that she not only expected you to eat it, but also kicked you out because you wouldn't.

They should have served their son a separate plate to play with.", "NTA- it may not be disgusting to her because it's her own child. But when it's strangers it's different.

Like you I won't eat food touch by a child with \"dirty\" hands no matter how young or how cute is the toddler. It can be full of bacteria. And it's not your child. So it can be totally acceptable a mother eat food touch by the saliva of her child, but it's totally unacceptable to force a friend to do so.\nActually, it's the right moment to teach the child that he has to eat the things he touches, or if he doesn't want to eat something, he just doesn't touch it.", "NTA...Hopefully the reality of the situation will eventually sink in and they'll start being better hosts.", "Not the ahole, Tania is clueless", "Fuck her.

Suddenly kid spit is no big deal, catching vomit in your hands is a typical Tuesday, and decorative poop is common.

Kids are just super unsanitary sometimes.", "NTA I\u2019ve been in the same situation with friends children and haven\u2019t eaten the food. It\u2019s pretty disgusting, why does it make any difference if it\u2019s a kid? Would she be happy to eat food you licked and put back on the plate? It\u2019s probably worse when it\u2019s a child of that age as they touch EVERYTHING and put hand in their mouth all the time. They need to make more effort to keep him away from touching everything and certainly shouldn\u2019t be offended when you don\u2019t want to touch it!", "NTA", "NTA, just because your friend is ok either their kids germs does not make it ok for you or others", "NTA\n\nThis is why I'm not fond of work potlucks.", "NTA\n\nAt all. Ugh, parents are capable of teaching their kids boundaries and sharing information about not picking shared food.\n\nAnd even if he hadn\u2019t been all over it, you get to say you don\u2019t want to eat, what a wildly controlling thing to try and force you to eat.\n\nEither your friend has always been a bit off, or she\u2019s going through something that has her seriously out of sorts. \n\nSorry you had to wear the brunt in front of the group", "NTA at all. I have a baby and a toddler and I would a) be mortified about that behavior and clean up anything they touched and b) never expect anyone to eat anything they don't want to ever, regardless of their reason. That's bizarrely controlling.", "NTA. I hope you took your gift back.", "NTA. \n\nI LOVE my nieces and nephews, and their parents would never let them behave that way. It\u2019s gross!! \n\nEven at 2, they know better because they were raised properly. They can touch any food that\u2019s on THEIR OWN plate after mom or dad has served them.", "NTA. You wouldn't offer guests food that your dog just slobbered all over, this is no different, it's still germs and saliva.", "This is a cute story about how the next pandemic starts. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This is gross", "NTA - She is the perfect example of entitled parent, who let the kid do whatever and expect others to tolerate.
