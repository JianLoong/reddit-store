I would just walk away from her too.\n\nWhen I was in grade 10 the bullying stopped because she was driving a car with some of her friends (not friends who had been involved in my bullying). Anyway, she crashed the car and 2 or 3 of them died. My bully broke her back, shattered her pelvis and broke a bunch of other bones. I was sincerely sad about the teens who were killed, but I was secretly glad my bully herself was suffering after the years of suffering she caused me.\n\nIt presses my buttons when people throw the word bully around for things like someone disagreeing with their opinion because I feel like it really minimizes what actual victims of buying go through.\n\nSo all this to say I would do the same thing OP, so maybe we are both AH \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don't know. I'm sorry you had to deal with that bullying though.

Just because someone apologizes doesn\u2019t mean they are owed forgiveness and if they are expecting or demanding forgiveness then it\u2019s not a legitimate apology.", "NTA nobody is obligated to accept an apology. If they want to apologize all well and good but that's where it ends. Whether you accept the apology or not is up to you. The busybody can see himself out.", "NTA why does he get anything for doing the right thing after 2 years of doing everything wrong?

I was bully in middle school through high school. Some people tried to apologize to me but I never acknowledged them because of the trauma it caused me.", "NTA\n\nThe only person who gets to have the luxury of accepting that apology is you.  Not anyone else.  It is on your timeline and only when you feel the time is right.", "NTA. You owe your old bully nothing. Absolutely nothing.

You were under no obligation to thank him or offer forgiveness. NTA", "NTA \nGood for him that he realized how mean he was and actually apologized; however, just because someone apologizes does not mean the other person has to accept it. It also doesn\u2019t magically make the bullying disappear. Maybe over time you could accept\u2026or not. The ball is in your court and it can stay there.\n\n\nYou did a very classy thing by listening to his apology and not flipping him off.", "NTA you did the right thing. Sometimes in life we have to speak up for ourselves and you did.", "I had a bystander of myself being bullied in HS apologize to me for not standing up. I had to take a minute to think about and, and accepted his apology - but mostly because we are now working in the same field and not doing so could have had a negative impact on my career. \n\nNTA at all.

It does not mean you have to pretend none of the bullying happened, but resentment is a huge weight on the heart. An apology at the minimum is an acknowledgment from them that they did you wrong and though it may not feel like it is enough to make amends, it is a good way to close out the bs you endured and move on. Remember, at the end of the day it probably wont affect them much wether you accepted it or not. Dont let it weigh you down anymore than it should my friend", "NTA.  You don\u2019t owe a bully anything.", "NTA\nAs someone who's owed an apology they're not owed your acceptance and forgiveness.

You don\u2019t have to accept anyone\u2019s apology for anything. You don\u2019t have to become friends with him now that he has grown up. But you just reduced yourself to his level by walking away.

Im also glad that it wasn\u2019t the former bully who was trying to force you to accept it. \n\nAn apology is not really a true apology if it is being forced to be accepted. Sometimes the consequence of being an asshole means that an apology cannot make up for the assholery. \n\nYou owe that bully nothing.

But I do think it's immature that you didn't acknowledge it (by acknowledging I don't mean to say thank you, just more of \"ok\"). But, this isn't your fault. You're still young (20yo I presume). Later in life you'll realize the wiser decision.\n\nPut it this way, he hurt you. He's an ass and he can't take it back.

Or initiate a genuine apology?", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe bullies anything, ever. He apologized so he could feel like a better person, not because he was sorry.

Society has, for some reason, pressured us to feel obliged to forgive when we receive an apology.

That doesn't mean they're entitled to your forgiveness.\n\nI hope you're doing well now. If the bullying has left scars, I hope they heal.

The bullying changed my life and affects me to this day. \n\nIt's been 10 years, but if my bullies apologized today I would not accept it either.", "NTA - I'd have done the same thing.  Why does one apology suddenly make it ok?  You grew up and moved on with your life.  Not your problem that bully hasn't.", "NTA - it was nice of you to allow him the space to make the apology after the years of trauma he inflicted on you, but whatever emotional needs he was satisfying then or now have nothing to do with you.  You take care of your needs and give yourself a good life.", "NTA... but I wish you would have responded in a more constructive way. Apologizing and accepting responsibility is one of the hardest things we have to do. I would guess he may not take this route in the future since he was rejected so bluntly, rightfully so...

I wouldn't go as far as saying you an asshole though because you left alot of detail out, but I definitely think that atleast a nod would have been more than enough. \n\nI was bullied heavily in school and one of them apologised to me years down the line at a busstop, I just said okay and that was it.

We shouldn\u2019t be saying it\u2019s okay to hurt people.\u201d She saw \u201cthank you for the apology\u201d as a better response/neutral statement. I\u2019ve also heard it recommended as a better response to teach than \u201cI forgive you\u201d or \u201cI accept your apology\u201d because we shouldn\u2019t be telling victims they have to forgive the people who hurt them. \n\nSo, I see your point.

You stand proud in the face of the nasty ass bully", "It like people giving homeless people a 20 dollar bill so they can film it post it for likes.", "I think some people are projecting their own regrets on here.\n\n\n\nIndifference is a choice. OP is just making the choice to move on and heal ***without*** having to interact with the bully. It's bizarre that people are calling OP immature for walking away. Maturity is also knowing when it's time to stop being around those who harm you. \n\n\n\nSometimes it's also the best way to avoid escalation.

The purpose of an apology is to express contrition to someone you wronged or hurt.  The apology is for *them*, not for you.  If they refuse to accept your apology, that's their prerogative.  **They** were the one who was wronged, after all.  You don't get to **make** them forgive you, or even acknowledge your existence, by uttering some magic words.  If you're **truly** regretful, you'll understand this and back off.

HOWEVER, in OP's case, this is way beyond a case of wrong doing. He was pushed around and bullied for 2 years because Jack was homophobic and an asshole. That's not something you can accept. I don't think it's fair to say what OP did was immature when what Jack did was beyond immature. What OP is/does, does not affect Jack, and OP not accepting his apologies isn't gonna affect him either.", "The bully had the chance to reach out prior to being in a public place. He had the chance to not bully in the first place. He had the chance to respect OP and ask if he actually wanted to hear him out.\n\nOP is not in the wrong for not wanting to hear more, or even this much from someone who bullied him. Particularly given the bully felt the need to do this in a public place, around their peers without any prior discussion.", "Yes you can. He was a teen when he decided to break another human being. Old enough to understand what he was doing and what a fucking AH he was. \n\nHe may want to feel better about who he is/was. but that's not OP's problem.", "Yeah, I know that. I even stated that myself. What I had asked though was where it said OP walked away before Jack could say more. From what OP is telling, he heard him apology, THEN walked away."]}
