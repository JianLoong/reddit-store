Its so so unacceptable that she puts herself first after you had a traumatic birth. Even if she cared from the beginning family comes first and she should accept that. NTA. She is.", "NTA.   \n\n\nSusan has issues\u2026 that are not about this birth or it\u2019s events.   \n\n\nI have no idea why Susan thinks she should be informed prior to your own family, but\u2026. I don\u2019t know why people like the Kardashians either!", "NTA.  You have every right to determine the order in which family and friends get introduced to your newborn.  Only someone who is incredibly needy would/could turn such a joyful event into something all  about themselves.  You already have one infant to care for; she just made your life a whole lot easier.", "NTA. Of course family sees baby first. Not understanding what she is butthurt about. I would question the friendship because of her response.", "NTA\n\nThis is about you and your baby not Susan's neediness or determination to make this about her. If this is the quality of your friendship you are well rid.", "NTA\n\nAnd stay back from this gate to hell which is about to open at your feet.\n\nWhen people split up sometimes they want mutual friends/family to take their side over the the side of the other partner no matter what happened in the breakup.  Usually its best to stay away from it.  It's too much drama and you've just had a child.  \n\nPretty much unless there is abuse/assault etc I don't get involved and just tell my mutual friends that the first one that insists that I pick and take a side is the one I'm dropping.  \n\n.", "\r  \nNTA. It's completely understandable and within your rights as a new parent to decide who meets your baby and when. Given the traumatic birth experience you had, it's even more important to prioritize your own well-being and establish boundaries. Your best friend, Susan, should have respected your wishes and supported you during this time instead of making it about her own feelings.\r  \n\r  \nThe fact that Susan reacted negatively, expressing annoyance and threatening to end the friendship because your sibling met the baby before her, is unfair and self-centered. It's not reasonable for her to expect to be the first to meet your baby, especially considering the strained relationship between her and your sibling. You have the right to prioritize family members meeting your child and it's important to surround yourself with people who understand and respect your decisions as a parent. Don't let Susan's reaction make you question your actions or feel guilty; you deserve support and understanding during this special time with your newborn.", "NTA\n\nSusan sounds like a delicate snowflake that makes every situation about herself. She\u2019s the AH in this situation, but she is going to spend so much time playing the victim that she will never see it.", "NTA\n\nThis time is about you and your family \n\nIf your mate can\u2019t recognise that, she\u2019s sadly not as close as you thought", "Fuck Susan. NTA", "NTA. Susan seems to be someone who looks at things only through their perspective. I imagine her saying something like, \u201cif we were really best friends she would have kept me in the loop the whole time.\u201d It also sounds like bitterness from the relationship with your sibling has  created a situation where she\u2019s constantly keeping tabs on whether she is more important to you than your sibling, as if it\u2019s one more thing to hold over siblings head. \n\nChild birth is difficult, exhausting, and in your case traumatic. She felt that you should have prioritized her in the days surrounding the birth. When I had my kid I was so exhausted I don\u2019t think I personally messaged anyone for a couple days, and my husband sent a message to family announcing the birth.  Prioritize yourself and your family, and don\u2019t waste time on people who cannot be supportive.", "NTA.\n\nIt's understandable that you'd want your family to meet your baby before your friends. It's also understandable that you gave yourself time to recover beforehand. Good on your family for respecting this need. \n\nSusan needs a reality check.", "NTA Susan sounds insufferable, really. She's mad that you had your family see you and YOUR child first, and not happy at all that you had a successful birth in general. This shit isn't about her, it's about you and your child. Just like not wanting anyone to see the baby for the first two weeks, you have the right to say who can and who can't no matter their relation to you.", "NTA. You get to set the rules around your delivery.", "NTA.\n\nI also had a traumatic first labour and had 'friends' behaviour in immature and childish ways in the early days. \n\nYou tend to lose friends when you first have a baby cause you're moving into a new stage in life and often people are not considerate of this and your tolerance for their drama goes down too, cause you have more important concerns the second you meet your baby.\n\nMy advice is honestly just to let her bow out. You'll make plenty of Mum friends in the next few years! You don't need crappy friends like this.\n\nSending thoughts regarding the birth trauma. My child and I both almost died during her birth and it's a scary thing to recover from - but it will get easier eventually. Wishing you a speedy recovery and quick end to this drama! Focus on bubby - you got this!", "NTA \nIt's your baby and your visitors, and you decide who you are comfortable with.

You don't need people like that in your life. \nShe's trying to make the birth about her. That's super narcissistic.", "NTA. Susan has issues.", "NTA she is being ridiculous. Instead of being supportive when you need it, she's sulking.  She sounds immature & it sounds like this friendship has run its course.", "Somehow not surprised your brother\u2019s relationship with her ended.

Maybe she wanted to have an excuse to make you feel like the asshole but didn't want to be your friend even without that. That's one best friend you don't need either way. You have the right to choose family before friends, and it's actually very logical. It's very strange she had issue with that. She's not family for this baby, so why does she want to bounding so badly with your baby? So weird. The fact she let you down just because your siblings met your baby before her is one big red flag. Don't worry that much for that girl. There's absolutely no \"whole mess\" and like you said, everyone else don't had issue about it.", "NAH.\n\nI'm close to NTA but I think Susan is in a legitimate bind.

You have one baby to look after don't need a second!", "NTA\n\nThe only thing I care about when my close friends are in labour is, do they know to contact me if they need support, babysitting, fill their fridge etc otherwise, I do not pester them until they are ready to reach out.", "My partner gave birth to our second child during lockdown.

A real friend would be excited for you and respect your decision.", "I didn\u2019t see my best friends baby until she was over 2 weeks old because I was sick and they needed to relax. Jesus.
