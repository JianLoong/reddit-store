You have the right to prioritize family members meeting your child and it's important to surround yourself with people who understand and respect your decisions as a parent.

You'll make plenty of Mum friends in the next few years! You don't need crappy friends like this.\n\nSending thoughts regarding the birth trauma.

I was there for it all and spent days advocating for her. This included not sharing info with other family members no matter what, until she was ready.

You need to do what you and your partner need and no one else. Priorities for most people include family over friends. It says nothing about your friend being less important, just that you have only so much time you are willing to spend with others at the time and family is usually first and often all at the same time, to make less preparation time needed. Then you move on to friends. After all, your family members have most likely known you longer than any friends have. For her to think she should be there before your family is a little bizarre unless you are in a LC situation with your sibling. Then maybe.
