For reference, my husband is 43, and I am 36. We've been married for 8 years, and have two children of our own, 5 and 2. \n\nWhen my stepdaughter was 10, her mother relocated to Vermont. We live in South Carolina. It ended up being a huge custody battle between my husband and his ex. Lots of parental alienation from SD's mother (which she confirms) and my husband was only \"allowed\" by her mother to visit SD once a month, and he paid $900 a month in child support. When SD turns 18, he we had our first, so he lowered that amount to $400 a month. We also paid off my old car, to upgrade to a minivan, and gave it to SD free of charge because she was going off to an out of state university. Her mother would not cosign on her student loans, so my husband did to make sure her tuition would be paid. SD also receives $1500 a month in veteran benefits for being a full time student since my husband is a 100% total and permanent disabled combat war veteran. SD also works a part-time job making $17 an hour (which I know isn't a whole lot in this economy). SD is no contact with her mother, by her own admission.\n\nRecently, I started a new job myself. Making more than I ever have in the past. In the past, it was split 30/70, then 40/60 and now we are pretty much making the same salary so it *should* theoretically be 50/50. Suddenly, husband is unable to pay his share of the bills because SD is always needing money. Her student checking is linked to my husband's account, and he saw that she was easily spending $100+ a *day* on DoorDash and other delivery services because she \"didn't want to drive the car that much\". Last month, she needed $500 for new tires and an oil change. Husband gave her that, on top of the $400 he already sends her. This month, husband came to me and said he wouldn't be able to make his half of the mortgage for March, or pay his share of the utilities because SD needed $1000 for her scuba diving equipment that's a requirement for a summer class she has to take to graduate (her major is in marine biology). Husband has told SD to slow down on the ordering out, spending her money unwisely, etc, but she never listens because she knows my husband will bail her out.\n\nHusband found out that SD recently got a $7k grant for the spring semester...and gave five grand of that away to a friend so her friend could buy a car. Now SD is worried about paying for graduation tickets, her cap and gown, etc. Husband is now asking *me* to cover those costs for her and I said no, I can't do it. Husband blew up on me, calling me uncaring about SD, and that I'm being selfish because he \"doesn't want her to struggle\" \n\nI'm at the point where I'm ready to tell him we just can't continue supporting her so much, or at least cutting back. WIBTA if I told him that?", "created_utc": 1676230825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110o9fu/aita_for_wanting_to_tell_my_husband_we_cant/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She made it to young adulthood with zero appreciation for money, and lacks responsibility.", "NTA    Giving YOUR money to a friend is the height of financial irresponsibility.  So is living beyond her means with expensive food delivery services.\n\nI would advise cutting off the money faucet.  She is well beyond adulthood.", "NTA.

You cant afford it and you shouldnt have to afford a 23 year old bad spending habits, I would let him know clearly where *I* stand, if I were you this wouldnt even be a discussion \"fuck off you either stop asking me to pay or we separate I will not pay for this bs any longer\"", "NTA. By not wanting SD to struggle, hubby is enabling her poor money management. He doesn\u2019t have to go cold turkey and completely cut her off but coming up with a sensible budget and limit (for example, at university, I got $100/mo for spending money and if I went over, I had to pay) will benefit everyone in the long run. SD needs to learn how to manage her own finances eventually - especially since she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA \n\nThere has to be a limit. You have 2 children to support. The grown adult with a job can stick to a budget and stop wasting money. Your husband needs to pay his share of bills for the house also, including mortgage, utilities, and half of all the childrens expenses. Anything he wants to give to his daughter should come out of his fun money.", "NTA - at all. SD needs a wake up call, starting with asking for that 5K back. Your husband sounds like he is carrying a lot of guilt here and trying to make up for it by paying for her. He needs to learn he is setting her up to fail, especially if the only bank she is content to keep using is the bank of dad. I personally would start separating your finances and protect your children, because this may end in a lot of debt.", "NTA.  Your husband is probably feeling some guilt about not being around much for his daughter, but throwing money into that hole isn't going to fix it.  Your husband needs therapy and you both need to come to an agreement on how much support SD can receive.  Up to $3000/month on delivery?  HELL NO.", "NTA. I wish this had happened before, but you and he and stepdaughter need to have a frank conversation about how much support this young adult will get from y\u2019all and when that support will end.\n\nObviously the occasional bail out and gift are ok, if it\u2019s within your means, but it should not be the expectation by any means.\n\nWho just gives 5k to a friend for a car? It feels like there might also be something else going on in the background that maybe you aren\u2019t aware of. \n\nWhen you do talk to your husband about it, give him leniency and grace. Don\u2019t go into the convo with all your cards on the table, guns ablazing. Explain your personal financial concerns and then lay out how much money is going to various entities including the SD and ask what you two can do together to support her becoming financially sound in the long run because the current approach hasn\u2019t helped her learn to balance her budget.", "NTA you should certainly scale back on what is given. Giving her the money is enabling her bad spending habits and she needs to learn to control her spending and be more responsible.", "NTA - she needs to be given firm boundaries and your husband needs to learn how to set them.  She may be 23, but she still needs parenting and seems like she hasn\u2019t gotten a lot of it.\n\n Possible solution:   \n\nPlan and give a solid budget for her, but it in an account that she has access to, and she has to keep track of it and pay off any overdraft fees if she incurs them (out of the next month\u2019s stipend or her income).   \n\nShe can be involved in the budget setting process at the beginning to see how it works and give her input. If she whines, she\u2019s out of it and gets what she gets. \n\nIf she has large purchases she needs to make, she needs to plan for them and budget her stipend to make sure she\u2019ll be able to cover them, because the stipend will not increase. This needs to be FIRM.   \n\nSet a deadline for when this stipend will be discontinued - for example 6 months after graduation so she has time to find full-time employment.   \n\nAlso - personally I had heard the word boundaries but never understood what exactly they were or how to set them until I went to therapy. If your husband has a hard time setting and keeping boundaries, I can vouch that therapy helps a lot.", "NTA - But this is way way bigger than a Reddit AITA post should be.  Your husband's inability to properly budget his household finances and set clear financial boundaries for his daughter are going to impact your marriage in a very significant way.  Money and marriage present a complicated balance of power dynamic that are unique to each relationship.  These dynamics are nor one size fits all and the only real advice to give someone is \"do what works best for your relationship\".\n\nObviously, the current structure where your husband has cart blanc to do as he pleases is not working for your relationship since you are posting here.  You need to sit down with him and possible some sort of relationship and/or financial counselor.  I'm going to assume that your guys aren't billionaires, so money is a finite resource for your household.  The two of you have to come to an agreement on how best to allocate those limited resources.  Every dollar spent has an opportunity cost (the lost benefit of what the money could have been spent on otherwise).  Currently, there is a huge disagreement about how the collective family money should be spent, and it's not about the otherwise discretionary portion as it has affected his ability to make required payments (housing, food, taxes, ect).\n\nIt sounds like your husband is well intentioned for what he is doing for his daughter and you are specifically asking in regards to \"so much\" rather than \"not at all\", so it appears as if you aren't doing this *because* she is your step-daughter and not bio-daughter.  So, don't listen to the throng of people who may come out screaming \"red flags\" and \"divorce\".  Get a third party expert to help work through this and set clear financial boundaries to protect the financial future of your entire family, including your step-daughter, because if the well runs dry, she will be suffering too.", "NTA at all! She needs to be sat down and made to figure out a budget, ASAP! 1500 a month and makes 17 an hr? Some ppl working full time only make 1500 a month! Daughter needs a rude awaking.", "NAH or NTA\n\nI'm only considering you and your husband. I think your problem is not the fact that he's helping the young lady; it's that neither of them appear to be financially responsible. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's a different conversation and is theoretically much better received than \"you are helping your daughter too much\"", "Your husband is going to cripple her at this rate. She'll never stand on her own. NTA", "You\u2019re being taken advantage of. NTA.", "NTA \n\nThis is no different than anything else in life when it comes to finances.  You all need budgets and spending limits.  It sounds like both your husband and your step daughter do not keep very close track of their spending. \n\nStart with your joint responsibilities with your husband.  Mortgage, utilities, groceries, other household expenses, cars, all the kids-related stuff, college funds, retirement funds, emergency savings. Then agree on what each of you will contribute to those shared expenses.\n\nYou husband then needs to look at what financial support your stepdaughter requires.  This is technically his financial responsibility, not yours. \n\nThe biggest thing I\u2019d worry about for your SD is that she is about to graduate.  There needs to be a conversation ASAP about what happens financially after she graduates.  It\u2019s one thing to support her through college.  It\u2019s another to expect ongoing substantial support after that.  \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d ask for a full accounting of what she needs through graduation.  What she earns, what her expenses will be, and what the gap is.  Since this is a shorter-term thing you might choose to help out on a one-time basis but you aren\u2019t obligated. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest she work on a detailed financial plan and budget for after she graduates.  Will she have a full-time job? Where will she live (and can she afford it)? What will her other expenses be (car, student loans)?   Will she need any financial  support from her Dad for a period of time (6 months? 12 months?) while she gets on her feet?  What you want is for her to have clear expectations about needing to become financially  independent  within a reasonable period of time.", "NTA: It would not be a problem for dad to keep giving her money if he was able to keep his share of bills paid. 100%P&T +spouse + 2 dependents = about $3,500 a month. \nAlso you don't pay taxes on it. You get car registration covered and a large portion of property tax covered. \nSpouse could legally even work full time if he found the right role. \nI am 100P&T and work full time. I cover the bulk of my homes bills. \nPlus, the daughter could easily get more grants and scholarships as a child of the vet. Plus it sounds like they get either the GI Bill or yellow ribbon benefit. \nAnywho, not the ass hole. The daughter is extremely blessed to not need to take student loans. They have some income from their VA benefit and from work. They need to better manage money and not be so generous with giving $5K away. \n\nI would recommend you sit first with the husband and talk about budgets and how it should be better split. \nThen encourage husband to also sit with his daughter and make her budget. She can live off ramen and peanut butter like the bulk of college kids. \nDelivered fast food can add up super quick. It's not a need, it's a want. \nIt should not be the husband's or your responsibility to even touch on things above necessities. Shoot even that, as the step daughter is an adult, is extra lucky. \n\n\nMoney can be a scary and hard conversation. So when you have that talk try to keep it positive, constructive and discuss long term goals. Like future of the other two kids. Or paying x,y,z debt. \n\nAlso it may be more friendly and kind instead of a strict cut off for the daughter. Start tapering off. \nA hard boundary should be your husband has to pay his half of bills, once he does that then he can start to give to the step daughter. \n\nEdit: It is scary to think he co-signed student loans too. Because if she does not keep up. That is compounded interest he is going to be responsible for. \nI would budget the scary what if, as she is showing to not be fiscally responsible.", "NTA the best thing you and your husband can do is help her to budget. Ordering take out food is a luxury not something that should be the main part of a diet of a student!", "in all honesty i don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the asshole here. it seems like your husband is overly-coddling her to make up for her past traumas with her biological mother. he has good intentions, but her behaviour is something he has allowed to fester, and by virtue of being her stepmother for a while, you too. you are very correct for feeling upset that he\u2019s asking you to fund her unhealthy spending habits, but ultimately this is an issue that needs to be resolved by him.", "NTA I left home at 18 moved from rural country town to a city by myself to start uni. I left with nothing to my name. I saved up $1000 for 3 years while in highschool to buy my first car while paying my parents board to live at their house & food. I worked 3 crap jobs sometimes to support myself, slept in my car at times. I sent money back home so my parents & brother could afford to eat when they struggled. I never took even $5 from my parents & I never would, they never had much of anything financially, things were always tough. I\u2019m not trying to compare myself here but rather illustrating where I\u2019m coming from when I say that:: There\u2019s no logical reasoning for your step daughter to be costing your family that much money at her age, she\u2019s an adult. What is happening almost constitutes financial abuse on her part. She clearly doesn\u2019t care about what her expenses do to you as a family, this is shown by her giving her money that is supposed to alleviate her expenses as an adult in studies away to someone so they could buy a car. You\u2019re being exploited & I don\u2019t understand how she can morally justify that to herself. She does not need support from you guys she needs to learn about adult consequences in life & supporting herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
