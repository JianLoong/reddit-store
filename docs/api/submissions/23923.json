This is our first time living together. \n\nOur house is an old American house that has been reformed many times. As a consequence of this, it has a silly layout where there are two bathrooms right next to each other that share the same wall. When we pulled the trigger on buying it, we made an agreement that I'd take the bathroom on the left with the shower and she'd take the bathroom on the right with a bathtub. Hers is much more spacious than mine.\n\nI soon learned though that my wife preferred to use my bathroom, but only to defecate. She'll go pee or take a bath or do her makeup in her bathroom, but when the time comes to have a bowel movement, she only wants to use my toilet. I usually wouldn't mind this, but the issue is that she sits very far forward on the seat which leaves streaks in the bowl virtually every time she goes.\n\nI first tried approaching this civilly by asking why she used my bathroom. She gave me a vague answer about preferring it. Then I asked if she could at least sit back a bit more. She said it was none of my concern how she sat on the toilet. I offered to change bathrooms with her, to which she said no thanks. Then I asked her to stop using it and she said it was her house too so she should be allowed to go wherever she wants.\n\nI'm honestly tired of opening the toilet lid to see her stool stuck to the bowl. The day before yesterday I installed a lock on the door that I could open with a key. At first she didn't seem to take the hint. She asked me for a key for the bathroom, to which I said no. Then (as she really had to go) she started to panic and asked me again and again to open it. I told her that she has a perfectly good toilet in her bathroom. She finally relented but came out of the bathroom extremely upset with me.\n\nShe's been ticked off and demanding that I remove the lock since.

You did absolutely everything but tell her you not wanting to see her actual shit was the reason you didn't want her using your bathroom. Women aren't looking at the front of the toilet bowl the same way men are because they just sit down to pee vs raising the lid and staring at the bowl the entire time.

It's just me cleaning up her streaks.\n\nI don't know why you think I'm just letting it all accumulate into a mudslide.", "Why is he an ESH? Its not like he locked her inside until she cleaned after herself. Its not like he locked the bathrooms until she cleaned after herself, he only locked H I S bathroom and AFTER trying to talk with her. So what he is supposed to do?", "Did you not read the post? OP tried communicating.", "He did talk it out. You just didn't want to read.", "At the end of the day they each have their own toilet. She can use hers. She clearly knows her poops are both messy and stinky and likes to keep it out of her restroom.", "They're right next to each other. Not a matter of convenience, so there isn't anything childish about this except for wife refusing to use her own bathroom.", "I can just imagine the lawyer drawing up the papers. Hahaha.", "Women don't understand that with men, if we throw something next to a basket, it usually means it's not dirty and we plan on wearing it possibly again. If it's dirty, we throw it in the basket. May not make sense to you all but there is a ton of stuff women do we have no idea why but we accept it", "If the shit hits the fan, she really does need to sit further back.", "Divorce level Amber Heard?", "No no, you destroy her toilet after the mcdonalds breakfast the next morning. Once them greasy hashbrowns start to lube things up, off to the shitter.", "Oh I think that's a little far, upper decker maybe, but shitting in a tub is just rude.", "Pleased to have been of assistance with that.", "I worked at a small store with a woman larger than myself.  Shared bathroom between just two employees.  and she was not capable of sitting any further back.", "Ok, I'm sorry for your situation, but still there are toilet brushes which you only scrub the inside of the toilet with after flushing. No need for a full scale cleaning, just scrubbing off the visible stains.", "Sounds tough, but still doesn't explain why you would rather leave disgusting streaks in your toilet instead of taking 5 seconds to scrub it off.", "What a lame excuse. My partner has IBS and has never left a mess.", "Yah, but that would be an escalation, not a solution...", "Apparently she don't know how to use a toilet brush either unfortunately.", "Then use a brush, that's why they're there. No excuse.", "Doesn't mean he couldn't leave them.", "If scooting forward to dirty her bowl, pooping while she baths, and shaving in there are step 1. Pooping in her sink is definitely phase 2.", "Nope, not ignoring that at all.\n\nMy reply to OP is ***ESH***.\n\nBut in ***no way*** in my book is OP *not* an AH.", "Anti-Man bias???????  I'm a Man you grape.\n\n\nPutting a lock on the outside of a bathroom door in a house where grown people live (and apparently can't conduct themselves as such) is absolutely an AH thing to do.\n\n\nDo not misunderstand - his Wife is a raging asshole as well....but he's not innocent here.", "Its not which she uses, she only shits in his, so he needs to clean after her. She still Has H E R   O W N bathroom.\nThink about like this. Lets say someone borrow your clothes from only for the dirtiest jobs, so their clothes stay clean. Who's the AH?", "But going straight to having a lock on the door, without having a conversation, or even attempting to resolve it like adults seems a bit extreme.", "Because you never mentioned the toilet brush, just her scooting to a different position.\n\nGetting it on the bowl is just inevitable, but leaving it there is not.", "I would try and have a sit down convo and really explain how you feel upset or disrespected in your space, if she continues to not listen and shut it down maybe suggest a third party(marriage counselor) to listen and that may get her attention or help out a bit more to have someone to manage the convo", ">She clearly knows her poops are both messy and stinky and likes to keep it out of her restroom.\n\nAbsolutely not. Neither you nor OP are mind readers so talking about what she 'clearly knows' and trying to talk definitively about her motivations is pure speculation. Adults need to use their words when they have a problem. *Especially* in a marriage", "I'm actually a woman who puts dirty clothes on the floor next to the laundry basket. Why? Because it's wet. It's usually sweat but it could be water from doing the dishes. So, I place it there until it's dry, and then it goes inside the basket.", "Then piss in it after you take a multivitamin", "I've been cleaning up after my own IBS for more than 40 years. It is not always as simple as a quick scrub with the toilet brush. If you don't understand how it can be that bad, congratulations. I wish I didn't.", "I mean if he poops in her toilet then fair\u2019s fair and everyone should be happy right?", "Sometimes people just need a taste of their own medicine.", "It's a shame she doesn't have the shower. A good ol' waffle stomp would have been a great Step 3.", "Dude didn't do anything wrong lol. Wife was disrespectful and refused to change despite him nicely asking and offering alternatives. Typical man hating redditor. \"Figure out if you want to stay together\" most typical redditor armchair therapist bullshit lmfao. \"bathroom issue?? DIVORCE\" get over yourself", "I dont think its a good long term solution but its sounding like she must not clean the toilet after so i feel like that should be nipped in the bud. making someone deal with your poop is so so disrespectful especially when he has asked her to stop that I dont think its too too extreme haha", "Where are you reading there was no conversation? OP literally says his wife refuses to compromise on this, that clearly indicates conversation did happen. Why do you ignore that information?", "Yes, this is why it's a problem. I have to clean it up every time. I do not like scrubbing my wife's poop out of the toilet bowl.", "Given the situation, I can forsee a sit-down convo going to shit \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Totally ignored the she has her own toilet part, and how are you going to call me out for making a guess about her awareness when I\u2019m replying to a comment where you started making guesses about the functionality of her toilet? Somebody else here can tell us both not to guess, but you definitely don\u2019t get to tell me or anybody else not to guess.", "This guy literally put a lock on the bathroom door and told her he didn\u2019t want her using his bathroom. \n\nIf anyone isn\u2019t communicating effectively it\u2019s the wife who \u201cpanicked\u201d because she couldn\u2019t use OP\u2019s bathroom. If something is wrong with her toilet and it needs repair, she can put her big girl pants on and communicate that or call a plumber.", "And a salad of beets, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage.", "Yeah ummm 'figure out if you want to be together' and Divorce are the same thing.\n\n\nThese people shouldn't be married. Hell of nothing else,  ***ESH** for still being married.", "That\u2019s just rude, even children clean their own poo off the bowl.\n\nIf you want to do petty, just poo in hers and leave it there, use her bath and don\u2019t rinse out your body hair, etc.", "NTA. Using a toilet brush is normal. Her insisting to go on your toilet and not using that brush seems like some weird power play. She can use her own toilet and use the toilet brush like every other person with two or more brain cells.", "He...never...directly...told...her...what...his...issue...is. He is a grown man choosing to use hints and smoke signals instead of just telling his wife why he doesn't want her using his bathroom. *That* was my the main point of my comment\n\nYou're going on a witch hunt for me offering potential explanations as to why something that upsets him so much might be something she literally can't see because men and women use toilets differently. You're also willfully pretending like words 'quite possible' weren't in my response whereas you used the words 'clearly knows' for your pure speculation", "As far as we know, he did. Reread the post, he said he asked about sitting further back on the seat, do you think he was being mysterious as to why? No. There are no smoke signals, he communicated clearly from way before they moved in that they would have separate bathrooms. \nHe asked her not to use his since she has her own. She refused. \n\nHe tried to compromise and said at least sit further back on the toilet seat, she refused again. \n\nSo finally he decides to assert his boundaries and prevent unauthorized entry to the bathroom. That was two separate times he communicated in no uncertain terms before putting his foot down. \n\nI\u2019m going to ask you an honest question and I want an honest answer, do you just side with women no matter what? This is a clear cut case where he communicated his issues in several different ways, and you\u2019re here straight up calling it \u201csmoke signals\u201d. That\u2019s such an unrealistic representation of events that I can\u2019t even figure out if we are reading the same story.", "No, you're being ridiculous. If someone randomly tells you you need to change how you sit on the toilet without explaining why, you're going to tell them to fck off too. They own the house *together*. He has no right to put a lock on anything so she can't access it. They aren't roommates, they're a married couple\n\nHe tiptoed around the issue instead of being direct and this is the result. If he wants her to understand what his problem is and change her behavior, he needs to actually tell her. The entire thing is so absurd and unnecessary because the embarrassment alone would probably be enough to immediately stop the behavior. It's not about siding with women; it's about not trying to pass poor communication off as good communication just because of the subject matter", "Watch yourself. You don\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t explain why, we didn\u2019t get all the details there. He summarized that interaction after explaining his issues to us, the reader, from a writing stand point it would of been repetitive to then repeat those same complaints to us a second time while describing what he said to his wife. Stop making assumptions. It\u2019s destroying your own argument. \n\nI don\u2019t know who told you married couples have rights to literally everything of each other. That\u2019s simply incorrect. It\u2019s called boundaries. You know what, I think I solved the issue here. YTA.\n\n\nEdit: ooo I love when they do some kind of angry rant and then block me, there\u2019s no better way to concede an argument \ud83d\ude02 somebody clearly got emotionally overwhelmed", "Watch myself? I'm TA? I don't know who you think you are but you can't threaten or gaslight me into believing my opinion is inferior to yours simply because you disagree with me. I'm not an AH for not crumbling beneath you, you're just toxic and apparently can't handle that being on the internet means others will see things differently."]}
