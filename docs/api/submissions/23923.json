This is our first time living together. \n\nOur house is an old American house that has been reformed many times. As a consequence of this, it has a silly layout where there are two bathrooms right next to each other that share the same wall. When we pulled the trigger on buying it, we made an agreement that I'd take the bathroom on the left with the shower and she'd take the bathroom on the right with a bathtub. Hers is much more spacious than mine.\n\nI soon learned though that my wife preferred to use my bathroom, but only to defecate. She'll go pee or take a bath or do her makeup in her bathroom, but when the time comes to have a bowel movement, she only wants to use my toilet. I usually wouldn't mind this, but the issue is that she sits very far forward on the seat which leaves streaks in the bowl virtually every time she goes.\n\nI first tried approaching this civilly by asking why she used my bathroom. She gave me a vague answer about preferring it. Then I asked if she could at least sit back a bit more. She said it was none of my concern how she sat on the toilet. I offered to change bathrooms with her, to which she said no thanks. Then I asked her to stop using it and she said it was her house too so she should be allowed to go wherever she wants.\n\nI'm honestly tired of opening the toilet lid to see her stool stuck to the bowl. The day before yesterday I installed a lock on the door that I could open with a key. At first she didn't seem to take the hint. She asked me for a key for the bathroom, to which I said no. Then (as she really had to go) she started to panic and asked me again and again to open it. I told her that she has a perfectly good toilet in her bathroom. She finally relented but came out of the bathroom extremely upset with me.\n\nShe's been ticked off and demanding that I remove the lock since.

Clean up your shit (literally).", "I know this is a joke, but my man bought me a 24pk of toilet paper during the pandemic & honestly that\u2019s when I knew he was the one\ud83d\ude02", "We still have a TP stash. It's the nasty paper that was all you could find in those dark days of the TP shortage. No one wants to use it, so it's still stacked up in the basement. Maybe someday we'll have a leak or something and will throw all the TP stash at it to soak it up.", "This is what I was thinking. What sealed it for me was her dancing around because \u201cshe really has to go\u201d and has a actual bathroom of her own lol. \n\nHe talked to her about it (mature) she told him to mind your business and kept leaving crap stuck to his toilet. I mean who does this anyway?! \n\nI don\u2019t know why but this whole post and thread has me laughing my ass off.", "I'm a naturally sloppy person. Which is to say, I am constantly leaving stuff on my counters, on my table, everywhere. I'm always extremely behind on cleaning. I'm working on developing better habits but it's slow going, thanks ADHD, but overall I'm always going to be a very messy person with a very messy home.\n\nHowever. HOWEVER. There are lines that I will not cross. Shit streaks are one. I might not have a sparkling toilet - this reminds me I should clean it - but shit streaks? NEVER. There's a distinct line between being messy/sloppy and being disgusting, in my opinion. Biohazard bathrooms are well over that line. And also well over the line of mutual respect for other people in the house.\n\nI live alone in no small part because of my messiness, mind you, and when I lived with roommates, I made sure my mess was confined to my room as much as I could. I lived with someone who is like you - very fastidious, very clean, down to a single crumb on the floor - and while we had our disagreements, we still made it work because we respected each others' needs. And neither of us was ripe. *Gag*.", "When my youngest was maybe 8 or 9, they went through a fruit snack phase. Like those little packets of fruit shaped gummies. I didn\u2019t mind, the big store brand boxes aren\u2019t expensive and there\u2019s worse things they could have chosen to snack on. However, I didn\u2019t realize they were just tossing the wrappers\u2026 behind their dresser! I pulled the dresser out one day to deep clean and vacuum behind it and I was like WTF is this?? It was like a wrapper graveyard. Put a stop to that pretty quick \ud83d\ude06 \n\nKids and even teens do the dumbest laziest shit. But the operative word here is KIDS.", "I was about to question if I'm a disgusting garbage just because I pee into the water lol What else are people expecting to hear from a bathroom lol", "\ud83c\udfc6 give this to your husband", "> Flushable is part of the name.\n\nthere are many products that say 'flushable' and all them should not be flushed (aside from toilet paper) - you ask any plumber and they will tell you the same.", "I keep concentrated lysol on my toilet brush holders. Serves the purpose of smelling good, killing bacteria, then when you scrub the toilet, you've got the cleaning action and since it's concentrated it still has cleaning power once it's in the toilet. I buy the bottles of concentrate at the dollar tree, highly recommend.", "Yeah. But that needs treatment and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect OP to tolerate it. I get it, I really do (luckily I kicked a lot of my germ phobia compulsions, but I still deal with some OCDisms) but it\u2019s not a way to expect your partner to live. \n\nI hope she gets help, and if it is a compulsion, I have a lot of compassion for that\u2026 but OP is definitely NTA. \n\nOr maybe she\u2019s just nasty, in which case I\u2019d be furious and have no empathy lol, and still vote NTA.\n\nThis would drive me insane. \ud83e\udd2e", "I like that idea. Do you know the shade name/store brand?", "Utterly bizarre is a complete understatement.\n\nIf this story isn\u2019t made up, it\u2019s one of the most ridiculous scenarios I\u2019ve ever heard of in my entire life.", "Yeah, this is exceptionally aggressive and disrespectful. I would only do this to someone I hated", "In The Netherlands they have \u201cshelf toilets\u201d where you can examine your waste to make sure it\u2019s healthy. Maybe this is her reasoning for sitting so far forward. That being said, if it doesn\u2019t all flush away she should use the toilet brush to clean it up.", "I think this wouldn't be as much of a problem if she just cleaned up after herself. OP didn't mention bringing up that part, just told her to sit different. How about, every time you use the toilet and leave it dirty, you clean it. \n\nEither way, this is a really weird dynamic", "Literally! I saw the title and thought \u201cDuh Y T A\u201d but after reading the whole thing I kinda hope OP starts shitting in her bathroom lmao", "I need some celebrity lookalikes to help process this one. Maybe it makes more sense if\n\nOP: Rainn Wilson\n\nWife: Colby Minifie", "This comment should be much farther up. I bet the sitting too far forward is due to the aversion as well (putting as little of her legs as possible)", "Myself and my husband moved in with each other a week after we got married \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Difference I guess being that we talk about eeevvveerrrryyytthhhiiinngg", "I think I know what you mean. My cousin in Germany had toilets with a sort of shelf where the deposit landed. I was absolutely terrified to use these toilets for fear that it wouldn't flush down.

I don\u2019t like his shows he doesn\u2019t like mine. I need to sleep with the TV on \u2026he needs total silence. It\u2019s been a game changer in a positive way!", "My first wife and I had separate bathrooms after our first house (so after the first two years). She had the master bathroom, I had the hall bathroom. If I laid out my clothes for work the night before, I could get up, slip out of the bedroom without waking her, and not have to go back in before I left for work. It was best for everyone.", "I knew a guy who married a woman relatively shortly into their relationship because they wanted to move out together and buy a house in the process. They needed to be legally married in some fashion to share the mortgage (or something) and since they hadn't lived together long enough to be common law, they went and got married. \n\nYou can imagine how long that marriage lasted.", "There is some missing piece of information here. I am surprised how few people are suggesting a CONVERSATION to figure out why this is happening. I would guess maybe her toilet does not flush properly, or the height of the toilet causes discomfort or something.\n\nSome women are conditioned to think that having large BMs is unladylike, so maybe she feels embarrassed that her packages won't go down the pipes in her bathroom. Whatever the case, there should be a discussion that maybe starts with, \"I know this is an embarrassing topic, BUT...\"", "It\u2019s probably about cleaning. They likely clean their own bathrooms and she can\u2019t stand cleaning poo so she uses his to avoid having to clean it.", "I wonder this myself. Is everyone just A-OK with throwing it back in the holder?", "Ugh! Okay, I just learned that term. Why would anyone, ever, shit in the shower?

I remember my 12-yr-old son was horrified when his cousin came to spend a weekend, and the first time my son went into the bathroom after his cousin, he came out yelling, \"what is wrong with you?!?!\" There was \"poo\" smeared on the inside of the bowl, and pee drops on the edge. Nephew, 10 at the time, got a quick lesson in toilet maintenance (from my son!). My sister-in-law was shocked when her son told her all about it. She said she didn't want to embarrass him, so she never mentioned it, just cleaned up after him. Yikes - I told her his future roommates and/or spouse has **me** to thank, LOL.", "That's why I said all the stuff about communication! To me, unconditional acceptance doesn't mean you don't have to change behaviors if your partner lets you know they bother them. I was referring to people that are saying things like, \"I can't imagine loving someone I thought of as gross\". People are gross, it's gonna happen. If a particular gross thing bothers you - you're right - compromise is the mature solution!", "Amen. That\u2019s super disgusting. I keep cleaner in the bathroom and clean the toilet every day. If I\u2019m in a hotel room and accidentally leave a mess, I\u2019ll stand in there dumping water in there until it\u2019s clean. Drove myself batty. I can\u2019t stand the mess.", "Even simply flushing twice is often  enough.  And holding down the handle until the water stops flowing. (A lot of people don't understand or bother, to  do this - just push the lever or button and  let go immediately.)  An appropriately placed container that can be filled with water, to  pour extra clean  water onto the soiled part of the WC basin, can also be helpful.\n\nRather than ask her  to change what may be a helpful physical practice for her and sit further back on the toilet , I'd simply ask her to make sure she leaves the basin, etc. clean.  Perhaps avail yourself of the phrase used  in another context in  \"The Big Bang Theory\" and remind her that doing this is a non-optional social convention!  After all, if  she does the same thing elsewhere she probably upsets other people, too.  Really it's a simple question of good manners.\n\nFrankly, I am taken aback that your wife is apparently not bothered by using the loo and leaving it soiled, for you or indeed  anyone else, to see.  If I were to do this, for  some  reason,  I'd find it excruciatingly embarrassing! \n\nIf your wife is totally unreceptive to any of your gentle suggestions, I too think that either (a) she has some deep psychological problem concerned with using the toilet, and you or a counsellor will need to find out what's going on.  Or(b) you have bigger problems than this in your relationship.  \nI am sorry.  \u2639\ufe0f", "I just tried to and when I explained it to him, he said \u201chuh? what toilet paper\u201d and now we are getting a divorce lol"]}
