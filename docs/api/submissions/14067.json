The way you speak about them and how they can STFU makes me think they might have a few issues", "The relevant part (I assume) is:\n\n> She... threatened to go live with her auntie\n\nBut I don't see how that contradicts me saying: \n\n> you told her to get out and live somewhere else\n\n(also assuming that is your point)", "https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cruae/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_stepdaughter/jf3atrz/", "Not a bluff if she actually did it lmao", "If my niece had to live with a person like you everyday, I\u2019d spoil her too", "And that just chaps your hide, doesn't it? Honestly, take a look at your past comments. You couldn't be more resentful if you tried.", "\"She didn't care to ask\"\n\nNonononono, that's not how it works. You, as the adults who moves her from her room, are the ones who need to start that conversation. You're not TA for moving her to the basement, but as far as I've understood it she's had no input into her new space and suddenly you're just \"hey go live further away from us, you're not core family anymore, you can live in the basement where we don't have to see you\". \n\nYOU TWO were responsible for making sure this wasn't just a \"go live here now, bye!\" moment.", "I think you've got to realize that she needs an out here. She pitched a fit because she wasn't consulted on the basement. So now it's your chance to be gracious and loving if her father does convince her to come back home. I hope you can do this for the sake of their relationship. \n\nTry to let go of your resentment. She needs someone like you in her life so she can bring her expectations into line a little and learn to compromise. So that you are the one she consults when she has trouble with her roommates in college.", "The onus is on the parents not the child", "You need to grow the fuck up.\nAll I hear is me me me. Clearly you didn't even try to care for this girl and I'm sure you're the one making this poor girls life a living hell.", "\"Don't go too far by calling out her behavior for what it is.\"", "Because you are talking like an actual monster. Every comment you have said may as well come from a Disney script it\u2019s so cruel.", "Because we can read context love, you talk like a monster and I can't even imagine what you say to/about her when you're not talking to strangers on the internet that you're pretending to be good for. I don't think she's a perfect angel, but I do think she's a troubled teenager with raging hormones, lacking a stable mother figure, dad won't stand up for her to his insane wife, and now she has to deal with their son being favoured while she is discarded to the basement and her aunt's house, all as reasons why she's acting out and not perfect. \n\nPray tell, what in your life is as stressful? That could excuse why you are talking to her/acting in this way?\n\nETA: look, I'm not ignoring the fact that you are in a relationship with a significant age gap. I know what that could do to a person, I know that you already feel unequal in your relationship and a bit insecure about being able to have a family you can call your own and you see your stepdaughter as the biggest threat to that. But that's literally why people side eye relationships with age gaps like this, because of the differences in life stages that result in things like this. But for one minute take a step back and re-evaluate what you're doing right now. What if you and your husband break up, and his new wife does to your son what you did to his daughter. Would you truly in your heart be okay with that? When you see that the answer is no, you have to face up to some hard truths in your relationship. Are you sure this is what you want? Girl, I'm 24 and I know not to be with a man over a decade older than me with kids because that's not my responsibility level right now. The answer is not to shut out his daughter, the answer is not to relegate her to \"the princess\", the answer is for you to remove yourself from the situation. Not break up a family. And if your husband could shut out his previous wife, he can do the same to your son in 10 year's time. If he's this spineless about his daughter, then I don't see your son being protected. Think long and hard about how you handle this situation, because how you do will be a good indication of what will come back to you.", "Literally every response from you tells another story than what you\u2019re actually saying", "You are", "You're a 25 year old that's jealous of her 16 year old stepdaughter.  You could literally be her sister. You got no parental rights.", "She may not be an angel but you are a monster. So is your husband honestly. People like you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have kids frankly.", "You realize AITA is meant for you to ask and take your judgement, right? Idk why you're wasting time arguing with everyone when you could be, idk, out in the real world working on your relationships?\n\nYTA, regardless.", "So you prove everyone right. \n\nGood plan.", "Being perfect has nothing to do with it. Your stepdaughter is a teenager with unregulated complex emotions that she's unable to navigate through herself because her brain isn't fully developed. YTA for expecting a teenager to be more of an adult than you are. Your temper tantrum caused this mess & she's has every right to be upset.", "No one thinks she\u2019s an angel. We think she\u2019s a teenager with a complicated family dynamic, and you are an adult acting like a petulant child.", "No one thinks she\u2019s an angel, but she\u2019s a child and you\u2019re the grown-up in this relationship. Calling her \u201cthe princess\u201d only furthers the conflict. You married a man with a child. That means treating her with respect even if you don\u2019t get it back from her. Because, again, she\u2019s a child. You could have tried to ease the transition, asked her input on the basement renovation, actively helped her redecorate. She\u2019s going to be a bratty teenager because she\u2019s a bratty teenager, but she\u2019s also a kid with feelings about her dad replacing her with a new family and I guarantee she\u2019s not actually happier at her auntie\u2019s even if she\u2019s happy to be away from you and the constant conflict. Hello, daddy issues.", "Because they way you are typing your answers and replies. The way you're talking about your stepdaughter. You are extremely immature.  \n\nYou need to grow up. You have 2 children. I don't care that you are 25. You accepted her as your child the moment you signed that marriage certificate. Be a parent.", "Maybe idk don\u2019t act like a monster?", "Grow up", "No one cares how she acts. She\u2019s a child. You\u2019re an actual monster", "But you knew he had a child BEFORE you married him, you knew you didn\u2019t have the room BEFORE you got pregnant. \nShame on you. \nYou\u2019re the reason step parents get bad names.\nAnd I wish your son the best of luck because with you as a mother he doesn\u2019t really stand a chance", "YTA for this comment alone", "Wow. WOW.\n\nI can\u2019t believe you just said that about her.

You sound like stepmonster.", "That is a disgusting thing to say. It\u2019s obvious to you she\u2019s only a nuisance in your life and I seriously doubt you were ever nice to her.", "You sound incredibly selfish and resentful that your husband has a kid that isn\u2019t yours and it\u2019s so gross", "and there it is.  Full mask off", "Ew. Did you just call your husbands daughter \u201cthis problem\u201d? I mean\u2026 you really expect people here to respect your opinion when you act like this?", "Wow, you are a MONSTER", "Your comments are not helping your case. The way you speak (type) is so nasty and condescending. No one is going to empathize with someone who can\u2019t even properly explain the situation without speaking like an AH.", "I hope your husband finds this post and reads the awful things you\u2019re saying about your stepkid. Seems like you\u2019re jealous of a kid", "The same could be said for your parents roughly 26 years ago.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Just admit that you don\u2019t want her part of your happy little family. Your husband would leave you if he saw this post", "And there it is. When someone shows their true colors, BELIEVE THEM THE FIRST TIME. I'm not the one to jump to divorce real quickly, but I hope your husband sees this comment and drops you like a hot potato. YTA.", "Wow.  That's... wow.  I mean, WOW.\n\nI doubt I can add anything that hasn't been said.  YTA.", "There's nothing but YTA after that comment.", "How much older are you than the 16 year old because you sound like a tantrum throwing child.", "Why do you hate your daughter so much? Are you jealous?", "That\u2019s a vile thing to say.", "You are beyond nasty!! She was his daughter long before you stumbled into the picture and \"princess\" aside she will always come before you, because that's what parents do! You have this problem because you just assume that a teenage girl wants to be shoved into the basement with no consideration for her feelings. This is on you for marrying a parent. Shame on you for not \"allowing\" your grown man husband to go after his flesh and blood.", "Then why can y\u2019all get a bigger house?", "Except apparently you didn't since they're isn't enough room for your stepdaughter", "The father doesn\u2019t sound great either.

What is the age difference between you and dear hubs?", "Yeah, and at 25 you should've understood what it meant to marry a man with a daughter in an already troubled home life before you decided to procreate with him. She should be able to be perfect as a child, while you as an adult are free to respond as emotionally as you choose? \n\nAnd besides, you listed two issues. She has multiple.  So she wins. And something tells me you deserve the attitude you get from her, what with how you talk about her to us.", "So you were looking forward to your step-daughter leaving? And well um, you are lmao.", "You sound incredibly immature, you very obviously dislike your stepdaughter.\n\nIf someone who has never met either than you can tell, your stepdaughter knows how much you dislike her.\n\n\nI mean this with as much kindness I can muster, you NEED to go to counselling and work through this.\n\nYou _chose_ to marry a man with a child. You, as the adult need to accept what that means and learn how to be empathetic, kind and compassionate to a troubled _child_. \n\nOr you son may end up someone else's stepchild.\n\nGood luck!", "Ah that explains why your husband just follows along with what you say \ud83d\ude02. He just wants some young thing by his side and is willing to give up his daughter for it. Gross. Evil step mom much?", "You're 25 and jealous of a literal child.", "You literally signed up for that when you became a step parent. Step parents have to EARN the status of parent and the respect of their step kids. You aren\u2019t entitled to it.

So, given that she's 16 now, he would be 32ish. \n\nNot the age gap I was expecting, honestly. Why would OP marry a man with a child she hates?\n\nEdit to add: yta", "Explains why she's so jealous lol.", "So you\u2019re 9 years older than your stepdaughter\u2026 no wonder she doesn\u2019t want to respect your authority. You\u2019re literally trying to kick her out of the family.", "In another comment OP says Hubs was 16 when he conceived SD, so 32", "This is the question", "There it is!", "This OP. Seriously, strangers on the internet are telling you YTA just from how you are showing yourself on this reddit because it is obvious how much you dislike her and are jealous of her. It's obvious to us so I can't imagine how much more it is to your stepdaughter.\n\nDon't be surprised when you finally ask him to choose between the 2 of you when he chooses her. Because it's obvious that where you're trying to get to. If he doesn't choose her then he's an AH too and you 2 deserve each other."]}
