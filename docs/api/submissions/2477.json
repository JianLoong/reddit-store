(I have celiac's disease)", "selftext": "I have celiacs disease and should not be consuming gluten. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went to the movies last night. He ordered soft pretzel bites (gluten containing) and I ordered popcorn (which is gluten free). When he was eating his pretzels I asked him to not eat from my bag since he has gluten contaminated hands from his pretzels now. He sarcastically asked me if I want to get a separate popcorn bag for him to eat out of. I said we don\u2019t have to and that I could just put popcorn in his pretzel box if he wants some. He told me he doesn\u2019t think my body would react to the amount of gluten on his hands. \n\nCeliac\u2019s is a very severe disease that can cause asymptomatic destruction of the gut lining. So whether or not it causes symptoms is besides the point of why I have tried my best to be gluten free for 4 years now. \n\nHe got upset cause he was the one who paid for the popcorn \u2018for us to share\u2019. At this point I told him I would pay for the popcorn to fix the situation. And I didn\u2019t mind sharing it in another way - like putting some in his pretzel box. I was even playfully trying to feed him some. After the movie I offered to pay for my popcorn again since he ended up not wanting any after our earlier discussion. He became so upset that I wasn\u2019t seeing his point or giving him sympathy about how it\u2019s hard dating someone who you can\u2019t even share a bag of popcorn with. I don\u2019t think I was being this way as I offered to share in a safe way. I can\u2019t really ease up on my restrictions so I\u2019m not sure what else he wants me to do. \n\nHe eventually said I was being a b*tch about sharing my popcorn on the way home. I\u2019ve never been called a b*tch by a man before. This really broke my heart because now I feel like he doesn\u2019t respect me and how I choose to feed my body. Am I the asshole? \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that we are both doctorate students in healthcare. So, I don\u2019t think this boils down to just ignorance on his part.

One of my parent has celiac and throughout our life we made sure to never have crumbs of gluten contaminate shared food (like using the same knife to spread the butter on the bread. I specifically remember this because it's something most people arent used to do, and that needed constant reminders). I've learn how it can affect them greatly when they eat some by accident but also how in the long run, even when you don't see or feel immediate effects, it can really deteriorate your health, even leading to cancer etc so him knowing that and getting into an argument about your boundaries about food is pretty shitty.\n\nBut I'd like to add a point and advocate for mental health. People with gut and food issues are more likely to devellop an eating disorders or other MH disorder that involves (for example) fear of poisoning etc. Wether or not there is an effect on your physical health of him eating with his gluten fingers in your bag is quite irrelevant in the end, because even if it had absolutely no effect in this area (ensuring he wouldnt leave crumbs or whatnot), it still pushes your boundaries around food and making you feel unsafe when you are already struggling with a physical condition that can be very upsetting at times, as sharing food and eating is a way of sharing and socializing. I find that very upsetting that he wanted to make you feel unsafe by making your popcorn unsafe, and moreover refusing to share non-gluten food through other means that would make you feel safe and enjoy eating the same thing.\n\nI hope you can stay away from him, as this is a extremely shitty behavior.
