He ordered soft pretzel bites (gluten containing) and I ordered popcorn (which is gluten free). When he was eating his pretzels I asked him to not eat from my bag since he has gluten contaminated hands from his pretzels now. He sarcastically asked me if I want to get a separate popcorn bag for him to eat out of. I said we don\u2019t have to and that I could just put popcorn in his pretzel box if he wants some. He told me he doesn\u2019t think my body would react to the amount of gluten on his hands. \n\nCeliac\u2019s is a very severe disease that can cause asymptomatic destruction of the gut lining. So whether or not it causes symptoms is besides the point of why I have tried my best to be gluten free for 4 years now. \n\nHe got upset cause he was the one who paid for the popcorn \u2018for us to share\u2019. At this point I told him I would pay for the popcorn to fix the situation. And I didn\u2019t mind sharing it in another way - like putting some in his pretzel box. I was even playfully trying to feed him some. After the movie I offered to pay for my popcorn again since he ended up not wanting any after our earlier discussion. He became so upset that I wasn\u2019t seeing his point or giving him sympathy about how it\u2019s hard dating someone who you can\u2019t even share a bag of popcorn with. I don\u2019t think I was being this way as I offered to share in a safe way. I can\u2019t really ease up on my restrictions so I\u2019m not sure what else he wants me to do. \n\nHe eventually said I was being a b*tch about sharing my popcorn on the way home. I\u2019ve never been called a b*tch by a man before. This really broke my heart because now I feel like he doesn\u2019t respect me and how I choose to feed my body.

I've learn how it can affect them greatly when they eat some by accident but also how in the long run, even when you don't see or feel immediate effects, it can really deteriorate your health, even leading to cancer etc so him knowing that and getting into an argument about your boundaries about food is pretty shitty.\n\nBut I'd like to add a point and advocate for mental health. People with gut and food issues are more likely to devellop an eating disorders or other MH disorder that involves (for example) fear of poisoning etc. Wether or not there is an effect on your physical health of him eating with his gluten fingers in your bag is quite irrelevant in the end, because even if it had absolutely no effect in this area (ensuring he wouldnt leave crumbs or whatnot), it still pushes your boundaries around food and making you feel unsafe when you are already struggling with a physical condition that can be very upsetting at times, as sharing food and eating is a way of sharing and socializing. I find that very upsetting that he wanted to make you feel unsafe by making your popcorn unsafe, and moreover refusing to share non-gluten food through other means that would make you feel safe and enjoy eating the same thing.\n\nI hope you can stay away from him, as this is a extremely shitty behavior.

It would not have hurt him to get a hand full of popcorn into his pretzel bag.\n\nSince you are both highly trained, I would not attribute this to being something accidental, this is full on-purpose disregarding your health.\n\nIn any case, he should respect your boundaries. If you do not feel safe, he should respect that. When you go to the movies, you want to relax and not be worried.", "Maybe he's right about you not reacting, but it doesn't matter. You gave him a bunch of alternatives.   \nNTA of course, but you could have handled it differently. if he didn't want some in his box or whatever and insisted you could have just given him the bag to hold, say you're going to the washroom and come back with your own bag of corn. I mean, you'll miss a bit of movie but the stupid bickering about popcorn is causing you to miss part of the movie anyway.", "NTA- I have celiacs, ingesting gluten can be extremely dangerous. I know I\u2019m in for a world of hurt if I get it into my system.", "Coeliac here, on an early date with my now husband we went to the cinema and he had oreo bites while we shared popcorn, all i had to do is say 'sorry i can't share cos of the oreos' and he was fine about it, i literally poured some popcorn into his oreo chocolate packet. \n4 years laterish and he is if anything more careful than me. If the fact you are both medical students and he's treating it like a fad don't be surprised if he never cares about cross contamination.\nAlso I have never been called a bitch by any partner, let alone over popcorn- it's important you tell him how its made you feel and understand yourself if he sincerely apologises.", "Celiac here, NTA and why are you still even with him?", "As a fellow coeliac:\n\nNTA.\n\nHe needs to come to grips with that you weren't being selfish. You are suffering from an extremely serious autoimmune disease.\n\nTo OP's boyfriend:\n\nEvery exposure has serious consequences. Besides horrible pain and any other short-term symptoms, the villi in the small intestine are destroyed, which means nutrient absorption is severely reduced. It takes approximately six weeks for them to fully recover. Furthermore, with every exposure comes an increased risk of intestinal cancer. You should know this. Take proper care of your girlfriend, ya dingus.", "NTA for not sharing, but YTA to yourself if you don't dump him immediately.", "Op, This man doesn\u2019t care about you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "AND he's in healthcare?  What a hateful baby. NTA.", "Everything stated so well, here. Please do not keep dating this guy, OP. If he pushes this boundary,  which one is next? \n\nHe clearly doesn't respect you.  \n\nNTA, in any way shape or form.", "I know a nurse who is anti covid vax and said people wearing masks was going to lead to decreased immune systems and soon we\u2019d have people dying from colds\u2026so you don\u2019t necessarily have to believe in science to work in healthcare unfortunately. My mom is a nurse and believes that my depression will be cured \u201cif I just got outside more\u201d", "Sadly, getting a medical degree doesn't mean that a person is actually intelligent. Look at Ben Carson. An extremely skilled surgeon, but an utter moron", "I wouldn't. What relationship? It would be over. ESPECIALLY for being so dense as to ignore a health condition. He can pound sand.\n\n  \n\n\nNTA", "Yeh my friend had a reaction because a bread knife wasn\u2019t properly cleaned between loaves. Like off work for 2 or 3 days", "I've known people with celiac, I'm so sorry you have to go through that. Anyone who would even risk triggering that in someone else is barely short of evil IMO.", "Right??? My roommate who has zero medical background and hadn't even heard of celiac until I was diagnosed immediately made sure to learn as much about cross contamination safety as they could. Even if he honestly didn't know, the fact that he refused to even listen to OP is appalling.", "Celiac has a bunch of short term symptoms that may or may not appear depending on level of exposure (like in my case, even the slightest cross contamination makes me develop a ton of mouth ulcers and awful stomach pain). Consistent exposure to gluten long term, even if you're not seeing visible short term symptoms, can dramatically raise your chances of getting various forms of cancer. It's a pretty awful condition to have tbh, especially since people often don't take it seriously.", "Soft pretzels are basically crusty bread, so yes, a risk. Crunchy pretzels also break and the dust from the package would be a potential problem.", "Wow, you're just looking out for yourself due to a valid allergy concern and he calls you a bitch for it.", "one of the nurses I work with is an anti-vaxxer and a covid denier and like\u2026 ma\u2019am, we work in a hospital\u2026 you have watched covid spread through our unit multiple time\u2026 why are you even working in healthcare lmao", "And then there's Dr. Oz, the snake oil salesman...", "Gluten absolutely does transfer. Bread crumbs can easily stick to fingers, and for most people with celiac, even unimaginably minute amounts of gluten can cause issues. In my case, I'm so sensitive to gluten that I pretty much can't eat food that has touched any surface which gluten containing foods have been prepped on. We had to change out all of my cutting boards and most of my pans after I got diagnosed because I kept getting sick from the remaining gluten on them (porous surfaces like cutting boards can trap gluten), despite the fact that my diet was otherwise completely GF."]}
