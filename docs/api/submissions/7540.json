It felt sudden to me, and there was no warning it was going to happen. However, we handled it very amicably imo and he wanted to try and stay friends.\n\nI met him online through a mutual friend and had been friends with him and the rest of the group for a few months before dating. When I went into hospital back in August, I sort of just fell away from that group of people where I couldn't be online. However one of our mutual friends had caused a lot of drama and we both cut her out of our lives because it was very toxic.\n\nNow in December she reached out to me, apologized and we started to talk slowly again. My ex bf during this whole time would message me and tell me over discord that he hated her guts, she was an *insert bad word here*, and I could talk to her but he was completely done with her. \n\nI'd always ask him about hanging out with other friends or playing games with other people and encourage him to do so while I was sick and or offline. His responses were always \"I don't really talk to anyone anymore\" or \"I only want to talk/play with you\" and when I'd dig deeper he said they all just fell out of touch.\n\nFast forward to the breakup, the first thing he does (after our apparently amicable and no hard feelings talk) was to go straight to that mutual friend he said he hated with a passion, and tell her everything I ever did or said wrong in our relationship. He told her a private conversation we had where I'd jokingly brought up how often she cycled through flings and then told her and every other mutual friend we had, that I was the reason he stopped talking to everyone. That he was worried I'd get jealous or upset if he talked to/played with anyone else but me. Because, and I am quoting him verbatim here, \"I know how I would feel in that situation and I didn't want to put you through that\" I'm sorry what??\n\nSo this friend came for me hard over dms and asked why I would say and do such things. I was shocked and extremely hurt. I never would ask/make someone give up his friends or isolate them from anyone as this seems controlling and I didn't want that. So my petty ass said screw this. I went through our past conversations, took screenshots and privately messaged everyone he told this bs to, apologizing that I was the reason they lost their friend. Then followed up with the pictures to prove he did this on his own and against my wishes. These photos may or may not have also shown the crap talk he said about that one mutual friend.\n\nHe's been blowing up my phone since asking how could I do that and call him out like that? All he wanted was a clean break and to get his friends back, and that I'm an asshole for making them question him. I haven't responded because imo he lied about me and our relationship to friends we both had, who then took his side no questions asked and kicked me out of their lives and discord servers based off word of mouth.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for sending proof to our friends?", "created_utc": 1673934906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e4h5m/aita_for_bringing_the_receipts_when_my_ex_had_me/", "score": 3225, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He consistently talked about her in a bad way, on a call, over messages. I apologized to her profusely when she initially asked me about it and admitted that it was wrong to say that. Didn't deny it to her and told her I'd understand if this changes our friendship.", "I'm sorry you have to deal with such short sighted self satisfaction and hope you have a bright future ahead.", "And what about the other times he messaged you about someone else? Did you just let him vent and not say anything in return, did you contradict him and stand up for your friend, etc?", "Thank you very much. The experiences I've had this past week are making me realize the breakup is a blessing in disguise.", "I let him vent to a degree. I would ask if he wanted a solution or a listener. If he needed to vent that's fine. Everyone has issues with their friends, but there were multiple points where I had to stop him because it was getting out of hand. Those responses were also added in the screenshots I had sent. One of the biggest issues he had was he didn't like how I wouldn't let him continue if he said something out of hand.", "He lied about you to all your friends but he's mad at you for defending yourself?

He wasn't able to refute me, because he knew I remembered exactly what he said.\nI never forbade him from anyone, so he had other intentions with it.\n\nThanks God, he is just an ex long ago.", "NTA.

You already dropped that group anyways-so who cares what nonsense your ex is saying to get his friends back? \nThey all sound flakey anyways. And if you\u2019re in the type of hospital I am assuming-they all seem pretty wacky and self involved to bring drama to you while you are in there.", "I am so sorry you went through that.

All my screenshots were from my phone and they knew immediately nothing was cropped or edited.", "I disagree that this is a justified ah move. IMO it's never being an ah to defend yourself against slander. Setting the record straight is always the fair thing to do.\n\nIf someone experiences consequences from their lies being exposed, that's on them for lying in the first place.", "I do feel slightly bad because for the most part, during our relationship, he was sweet and kind. A little near sighted with being open minded, but kind. But it definitely feels justified as I went out of my way to not say anything bad about him or our relationship after the fact. Not even to my best friend. And he knew this, and did the opposite. I don't usually take the petty route, but this time it felt amazing", "Why do people try to do the full 180 acting like you have memory loss and won't remember the conversations? \n\nGlad he's your ex as well!", "To clarify, I am not currently in the hospital. That was a couple months ago. I had slowly been talking to them again once I was well enough to come home as I wasnt able to keep up with them when I was in there. I don't understand how caring if someone tries to ruin my character makes me an AH? Please explain that part further.", "So let me get this straight.  He lies to the friend group about you but when you tell the truth, with evidence of what really transpired, he's hurt that you called him out?  What an AH \n\ndefinitely NTA", "I am so proud of you. That was epic.  \n\nHe did it because he's an asshole.", "I can see where both of you are coming from. And you make a valid point that it's always fair to set the record straight.

So are these like all online only friendships/relationships with other gamer people?", "Maybe that was harsh-you\u2019re not really an AH for caring-but don\u2019t care anyways. If these people were worth being friends with they would of looked beyond the ex saying things in a break up. You wouldn\u2019t need to show \u2018proof\u2019 after the fact-cuz they would of shut that crap down.", "Basically yes. And before I found out he had done this, he had taken the opportunity to vent to me about me. About every inadvertent thing I'd said or done to hurt him during our relationship and that he believes I don't actually like men and am a sexist to men because I am wary of men I do not know. And I just let him say it while constantly apologizing and validating his feelings towards things like that.", "Lol thank you! It was the most powerful I've ever felt. To be able to actually have a \"Well actually what happened was\" moment!", "It's nice that you do, but he doesn't have the same concern about hurting you. \n\nYou are redressing the balance here, not starting something to hurt him. He hurt you and you are allowed to say, \"that thing you did - that was hurtful to me because it was a lie.\"\n\nYou don't have to accept being hurt to be the bigger person. It's ok to tell the facts of the situation and walk away.", "Some of them are online only, and some are people I know in real life. But yes, it's great for connecting to other gamers as well", "I did respond to another comment saying that at this point, I don't care if I do get that whole group back.

What a jerk", "Out of curiosity, what has been the friend group's reaction to your evidence of what really transpired?  are you back in the group and he's out?", "My video game skills ended with Sega as a kid haha. Other than commenting on like a Reddit post which is anonymous I am way too wary to talk to people I don\u2019t know online. When I was in middle school I believe we watched this movie \u201cStrangeland\u201d that scared the f out of me. Oh and by the way good riddance, on to better things for you!", "I rarely read the comments under the initial posts-so I didn\u2019t see. But that circle sounds flakey. Anyone that bases their connections on gossip doesn\u2019t seem like people worthy of your time. And even if you have been out of the hospital a bit-if it was for mental health-good friends would not bring a bunch of hearsay and drama that could harm your recovery to you.", "I've had one friend completely ignore me, another reach out to get my whole side, and another who completely forgives him but still blames me for him not talking to her. One friend had my back from the start, before any of this happened and never believed what he said. The 2 others have yet to say anything. Honestly though, at this point I don't care about getting back in the friend group or him being out. This has showed me the insanity that can happen based on word of mouth. So I will stick with my couple of close friends who didn't believe the lies and move on from the others. I was more worried about just clearing my name because I try my best to be nice to everyone and non judgmental. So I hated that they believed him without a second thought for my character", "Smart.  Surround yourself with true friends, the rest aren't necessary", "ESH. This is middle school crap. All couples say things to each other about people they wouldn't say to their faces.

If he JUST wanted his friends group back, he couldve just told you -- \"hey im not comfortable with you keeping my friends as your friends\".... instead of trying to make you look bad.", "No. He's gaslighting you. But I'd be very careful where it came to him. Gaslighters can be dangerous people. And if he's pissed off at you, perhaps cut him off completely, and block his phone. If he keeps pestering you, get a restraining order. If he disregards it, arm yourself and keep your eyes open.", "NTA. He messed up with his friends and breaking up with you provided a ready made excuse/scapegoat to get him off the hook. Plus provided payback for whatever imagined offense you did, in his mind, that FORCED him to break up with you (that was sarcasm btw). Unfortunately for him, you came to play \"Now He Found Out\", which is exactly what he deserves for playing \"F'ed Around\".", "NTA\n\nHe learned the lesson:\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prices. \n\nHas he really been that stupid to do all his rants via dm's?", "NTA - sounds like he F'ed around and subsequently found out.", "This reminds me of one of my exes\n\nI met him through mutual friends, got added to their little group and all, but one day he told me he just wanted to date me to get his mother off his back (he was bi, was with a guy before we started going out and his mother was quite against it), but that he turned out to actually like me... And I dumped him cause god-f-dammit, it hurt to know I was lied to like this\n\nI told him we could be friends and could still be close, but that dating was off limits from them on\n\nWell, he went and tried to get me kicked from his friends group \"you either kick her or kick me\"\n\nWell... He got kicked within a second and I ALMOST felt bad for him \n\n\nNowadays I saw that he graduated as an architect and seems to be doing well, I'm happy that he seems ok... Though I'd never talk to him again, I don't wish him ill, he was just immature as fuck and needed to grow up... And seems like he did, so great!", "Lmfao he tried to do the same thing to you and gets upset that when you did it back you have nothing to feel bad about I wouldn\u2019t", "NTA", "INFO: So you're asking if YTA for getting r/pettyrevenge against your ex boyfriend?", "Nta, he intentionally tried to hurt you. He blamed you for his lack of commitment to his friendships and made you look like an abuser. He got caught and is now blaming you for what he did. Block him and move on.", "Sounds like he felt inferior to you and wanted to make sure he had the friends so that there was no risk of anyone finding out about his perceived inferiority. I dunno man the insecurity is awful. Sorry OP. NTA you been to be on r/pettyrevenge", "NTA, he didn't like the taste of his own medicine, fuck'em.", "NTA", "NTA and \ud83d\udc4f for the pettiness. HoW cOuLd YoU cAlL mE oUt LiKe ThAt ummm excuse me?? He was making you look like the bad guy only to make himself look better and he needs to grow up, sounds like you dodged a bullet with that one.", "Y'all are acting like you're in highschool. If he wants to pull some crap like that on your mutual friends and they automatically take his side, then they don't deserve to be your friends and you shouldn't be going to such petty lengths to win them over. \n\nYou're a grown ass adult just move on. ESH", "this is his personality. woe betide the next one he gets involved with.", "Wildest part is he could've easily gotten his friends back by telling the truth and apologizing. Most people have experience getting wrapped up in a relationship and forgetting to keep in touch with others. It's an incredibly common occurrence, and, in my experience, most people tend to be pretty understanding about it if you give a genuine apology.", "I have cut him out completely. And he lives in a different country so thankfully it would never get to that point as it is pretty impossible to get a weapon over into my country. And guns are not acquired easily here. I always keep a samurai sword and machete in my bedroom just in case of break ins though. (Just realized how nerdy that sounded lol)", "Yes, every single thing was lengths and lengths of dms to me", "My intention was not to win them over. I've stated a few times that I believe it is better that I be done with them. My intention is and was to clear my name. As people talk and in our community of online people, things get blown up over small things. I wasn't about to have my character ruined based off word of mouth. As you said, I am a grown ass adult. And a grown ass adult can still stand up for themselves then walk away", "his way which is nasty, toxic, and destructive", ">I went out of my way to not say anything bad about him or our relationship after the fact... And he knew this, and did the opposite\n\nThat's what he expected to happen this time, too.  He thought he could climb back into the friend group by stepping on your back.  Turns out he was wrong.", "Would be pretty funny if they were ngl", "Oh boy... \nI wish him the best of luck :chuckles:", "I have no intention of sharing anything else with any other person. The only thing I wanted/did was share enough to clear my name. No use completely destroying someone", "Would you have taken this venting and responded in this way before you met him? Often (Not always but often, I know some people just don't like confrontation like that) when we end up in relationships with people like this, they cut down your confidence and self esteem over time. It can take some time to build it back up,   \n\n\nAlso I would utterly disregard everything he said in that verbal rampage, he was talking out of his borthole to try to hurt you and cut you down", "He\u2019s a jerk and that friend group isn\u2019t worth it if they take his side after the proof you sent. Sorry you had to go through this, hun. There are really good men out there, you just have to dig a bit to find them. NTA", "yes and be grateful it occurred before it got even more complicated. you can make a break. if you had a kid it would make it that much more difficult", "I lived 25 minutes from Foley and briefly in Missouri! Same!!!", "I don't need more details on than that clarification and I didn't expect any details. I didn't have the impression you where out on a vendetta.\n\nJust thought you'd like to know, his actions amuse me after he tried to badmouth you.", "Fafo. NTA", "NTA. He started this as soon as he started with the lies. You had every right to defend yourself, and from what you said about them taking his side no questions asked, the screenshots were completely justified.", "NTA. YOU did not get his friends to question him, HE did that perfectly on his own. He's just angry he got caught. Good for you for not being in a relationship with this piece of work anymore.", "Nope. Your ex is the asshole here.", ">I'd jokingly brought up how often she cycled through flings\n\nUmm what? Why?\n\nESH. Yall sound exhausting and obscenely immature.", "So...did you get the friends back? Do you even want them back after this episode of bs? Inquiring minds (mine) want to know.\n\nOh, and NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't get a clean break if you date within a friend group if they are in fact completely mutual.  They're not going to tell the other person they're no longer welcome in the group, as much as you'd like them to disappear.  Possibly even if the person cheated, if you've all been friends forever.  That's the chance you take.  It can be great if it works out, but if it doesn't, the other person likely isn't going away.", "NTA", "NTA. This sounds very high schoolish tho. I almost got a headache reading it.", "NTA, and bravo! ( insert slow clap)", "NTA", "NTA", "You are NTA but you need to put this group of friends behind you and move in.  There is far too much drama in this group", "Nta", "NTA. You set a boundary to not accept his lies and betrayal. You backed up your defense with actual evidence. Your ex is suffering the consequences of his own actions. So are the mutual group of friends for blindly trusting him. \n\nYou\u2019re better off with out the whole bunch. If I were you, now that you\u2019ve proven your innocence, I\u2019d walk away from them all with my head held high. Block them all. Nothing he can say or do now will matter. He\u2019s proven to be the liar and manipulator and they\u2019re always going to doubt what he says now. And you don\u2019t have to deal with that drama.", "NTA\n\nHe fucked around with your reputation to cover for his shortcomings, he finds out that you NEVER put anything in writing that could bite you in the arse later.", "You answered their questions honestly.  Not sure how this situation is all your fault. NTA", "Never let anyone disparage your reputation! Ya done guud, gurl! \n\nNTA!", "You're not TA , but you need to distance yourself from this entire group. It all seems incredible unhealthy and toxic.", "You already know that answer. The question is why do you care that his feelings are hurt?", "NTA \nI would've done the same and don't be friends with those other that believed him so easily", "NTA.", "No way Jose you did really well.", "NTA", "NTA but it also sounds like you need some IRL friends.", "Oh my god so childish. Nta", "NTA but damn. Maybe he shouldn't go talking shit if theres proof of lying? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", ">He told her a private conversation we had where I'd jokingly brought up how often she cycled through flings \n\nESH and all y'all have some growing up to do.", "NTA.", "I have both lol", "That\u2019s quite an extreme way to \u201cget closure\u201d. There are better ways than shunning her from the group. You can\u2019t say A (amicable breakup), and finish on Z (completely screw her over).", "He definitely wanted a clean break and wanted you to go away. You are NTA, but think about if you want these people in your life after all of this. Good luck to you. You will definitely find someone better.", "You're protecting yourself! If that \"hurts\" someone else, it's because their own shitty behavior is coming back to bite them. It's Ike if you were to hold up your hand to say stop, and they run their face into it. Repeatedly. You are not the source of the harm here.", "He hurt himself with his lies. He took a risk with lying and they came out. \nThat's not on you. \n\nCongratulations that your trash took itself out. Bullet dodged.....", "Did we date the same guy? Your whole story is so painfully familiar, best of luck and strength to you", "- Maya Angelou", "I dunno, I'm a man and I'd be afraid of a woman killing me. Crazy comes in all shapes and sizes after all...", "NTA\n\nDon't start none, there won't be none. He threw himself under the bus.", "Ding ding ding! I thought I recognised that. I  grew up with a narcissistic mother as well and it took me a long time to realize this. \n\nIt's because you get blamed every time the consequences hit the narcissist, because it can't possibly be their fault, and eventually your normal meter is completely off.\n\nDid you know that children of narcissists are more likely to find a narcistic partner? \n\nDo not take him back, and be aware of hoovering. Look that up online and don't fall for it!!!!!!\n\nETA I highly recommend the videos by Dr Ramani on YouTube.", "Ok, but do you fear going out after dark, going out with your mates for drinks, getting onto any public transport, because you're scared that *any* woman would k\\*ll you (let alone drug/r\\*pe you)?\n\nBecause I have heard plenty of women being afraid because of men for these reasons and many more. I've heard of a very few men being *concerned* about getting into a fight or mugged by *other* men. But I've NEVER heard of men generally being afraid of women.", "Bring those receipts! Yes! NTA.  I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself..", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. He played himself.", "Sounds like he fucked around and found out.\n\nNTA op.", "NTA.   \n\n\nOne good turn deserves another.", "Oh yeah. Discord friends, players, servers... This bring back memories. NTA. I understand what he tried to do, get back friends while dirting you. Maybe the break up was something he had been thinking about for quite awhile, Idk. You're better off without him, and in my experience it's always good to keep the receipts.", "NTA", "NTA. FAFO didn\u2019t he.", "NTA!!! He f\u2019d around and found out! You see the more you f around, the more you going to find out\u2026 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Definitely NTA! Did those mutual friends work things out with you after the proof was sent? If not, they\u2019re not worth it either. Lots of amazing gamer communities out there (I\u2019m in lots of discord places myself!) so you will find something better :D", "NTA he fucked around & found out", "NTA.. play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. He threw you under the bus only for the bus to fall on its side where he was standing. \n\nSmart on you keeping the evidence for the rainy day.", "Bingo", "Crossstitch \ud83d\udca1", "Narcissists tend to (subconsciously) target people who are \u201cpathologically kind.\u201d When someone is always happy and willing to oblige the other, that can be a recipe for disaster. It sucks because it really is the kind person\u2019s true nature to be kind, but they have to learn to be careful."]}
