It felt sudden to me, and there was no warning it was going to happen. However, we handled it very amicably imo and he wanted to try and stay friends.\n\nI met him online through a mutual friend and had been friends with him and the rest of the group for a few months before dating. When I went into hospital back in August, I sort of just fell away from that group of people where I couldn't be online. However one of our mutual friends had caused a lot of drama and we both cut her out of our lives because it was very toxic.\n\nNow in December she reached out to me, apologized and we started to talk slowly again. My ex bf during this whole time would message me and tell me over discord that he hated her guts, she was an *insert bad word here*, and I could talk to her but he was completely done with her. \n\nI'd always ask him about hanging out with other friends or playing games with other people and encourage him to do so while I was sick and or offline. His responses were always \"I don't really talk to anyone anymore\" or \"I only want to talk/play with you\" and when I'd dig deeper he said they all just fell out of touch.\n\nFast forward to the breakup, the first thing he does (after our apparently amicable and no hard feelings talk) was to go straight to that mutual friend he said he hated with a passion, and tell her everything I ever did or said wrong in our relationship. He told her a private conversation we had where I'd jokingly brought up how often she cycled through flings and then told her and every other mutual friend we had, that I was the reason he stopped talking to everyone. That he was worried I'd get jealous or upset if he talked to/played with anyone else but me. Because, and I am quoting him verbatim here, \"I know how I would feel in that situation and I didn't want to put you through that\" I'm sorry what??\n\nSo this friend came for me hard over dms and asked why I would say and do such things. I was shocked and extremely hurt. I never would ask/make someone give up his friends or isolate them from anyone as this seems controlling and I didn't want that. So my petty ass said screw this. I went through our past conversations, took screenshots and privately messaged everyone he told this bs to, apologizing that I was the reason they lost their friend. Then followed up with the pictures to prove he did this on his own and against my wishes. These photos may or may not have also shown the crap talk he said about that one mutual friend.\n\nHe's been blowing up my phone since asking how could I do that and call him out like that? All he wanted was a clean break and to get his friends back, and that I'm an asshole for making them question him. I haven't responded because imo he lied about me and our relationship to friends we both had, who then took his side no questions asked and kicked me out of their lives and discord servers based off word of mouth.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for sending proof to our friends?", "created_utc": 1673934906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e4h5m/aita_for_bringing_the_receipts_when_my_ex_had_me/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The guy tossed me under the bus to make himself look good and me look bad. I let it go at the time but over the months and weeks after, they'd ask me questions and I'd just share screen with them so they could see unedited discord conversations. \n\nYour guy FAFO.

He was the one to expose your private conversations by telling the one friend about the offhand comment you made before you got to know her better. And then he used that to start a smear campaign against you. If he\u2019s going to start some BS like that he really should have thought things through. \n\nYeah you could have just walked away from that mess and the people who would blindly take his side without talking to you first but revenge is so much sweeter. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. You just finished what he started. He wanted to show them one text that reflected you in a bad light and you showed them all the text to clear up any confusion. Was it an A H move on your part? Maybe but it\u2019s a justified one. His way was manipulative and yours was informative. I\u2019m sure your friends are all a bit uncomfortable with being put in the middle of this but they can all talk to him about that since he\u2019s the one to drag them all there. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your breakup wasn\u2019t as amicable as you thought.
