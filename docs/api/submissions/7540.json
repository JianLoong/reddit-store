It felt sudden to me, and there was no warning it was going to happen. However, we handled it very amicably imo and he wanted to try and stay friends.\n\nI met him online through a mutual friend and had been friends with him and the rest of the group for a few months before dating. When I went into hospital back in August, I sort of just fell away from that group of people where I couldn't be online. However one of our mutual friends had caused a lot of drama and we both cut her out of our lives because it was very toxic.\n\nNow in December she reached out to me, apologized and we started to talk slowly again. My ex bf during this whole time would message me and tell me over discord that he hated her guts, she was an *insert bad word here*, and I could talk to her but he was completely done with her. \n\nI'd always ask him about hanging out with other friends or playing games with other people and encourage him to do so while I was sick and or offline. His responses were always \"I don't really talk to anyone anymore\" or \"I only want to talk/play with you\" and when I'd dig deeper he said they all just fell out of touch.\n\nFast forward to the breakup, the first thing he does (after our apparently amicable and no hard feelings talk) was to go straight to that mutual friend he said he hated with a passion, and tell her everything I ever did or said wrong in our relationship. He told her a private conversation we had where I'd jokingly brought up how often she cycled through flings and then told her and every other mutual friend we had, that I was the reason he stopped talking to everyone. That he was worried I'd get jealous or upset if he talked to/played with anyone else but me. Because, and I am quoting him verbatim here, \"I know how I would feel in that situation and I didn't want to put you through that\" I'm sorry what??\n\nSo this friend came for me hard over dms and asked why I would say and do such things. I was shocked and extremely hurt. I never would ask/make someone give up his friends or isolate them from anyone as this seems controlling and I didn't want that. So my petty ass said screw this. I went through our past conversations, took screenshots and privately messaged everyone he told this bs to, apologizing that I was the reason they lost their friend. Then followed up with the pictures to prove he did this on his own and against my wishes. These photos may or may not have also shown the crap talk he said about that one mutual friend.\n\nHe's been blowing up my phone since asking how could I do that and call him out like that? All he wanted was a clean break and to get his friends back, and that I'm an asshole for making them question him. I haven't responded because imo he lied about me and our relationship to friends we both had, who then took his side no questions asked and kicked me out of their lives and discord servers based off word of mouth.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for sending proof to our friends?", "created_utc": 1673934906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e4h5m/aita_for_bringing_the_receipts_when_my_ex_had_me/", "score": 1653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He consistently talked about her in a bad way, on a call, over messages. I apologized to her profusely when she initially asked me about it and admitted that it was wrong to say that. Didn't deny it to her and told her I'd understand if this changes our friendship.", "I'm sorry you have to deal with such short sighted self satisfaction and hope you have a bright future ahead.", "And what about the other times he messaged you about someone else? Did you just let him vent and not say anything in return, did you contradict him and stand up for your friend, etc?", "Thank you very much. The experiences I've had this past week are making me realize the breakup is a blessing in disguise.", "I let him vent to a degree. I would ask if he wanted a solution or a listener. If he needed to vent that's fine. Everyone has issues with their friends, but there were multiple points where I had to stop him because it was getting out of hand. Those responses were also added in the screenshots I had sent. One of the biggest issues he had was he didn't like how I wouldn't let him continue if he said something out of hand.", "He lied about you to all your friends but he's mad at you for defending yourself?

He wasn't able to refute me, because he knew I remembered exactly what he said.\nI never forbade him from anyone, so he had other intentions with it.\n\nThanks God, he is just an ex long ago.", "NTA.

You already dropped that group anyways-so who cares what nonsense your ex is saying to get his friends back? \nThey all sound flakey anyways. And if you\u2019re in the type of hospital I am assuming-they all seem pretty wacky and self involved to bring drama to you while you are in there.", "I am so sorry you went through that.

All my screenshots were from my phone and they knew immediately nothing was cropped or edited.", "I disagree that this is a justified ah move. IMO it's never being an ah to defend yourself against slander. Setting the record straight is always the fair thing to do.\n\nIf someone experiences consequences from their lies being exposed, that's on them for lying in the first place.", "I do feel slightly bad because for the most part, during our relationship, he was sweet and kind. A little near sighted with being open minded, but kind. But it definitely feels justified as I went out of my way to not say anything bad about him or our relationship after the fact. Not even to my best friend. And he knew this, and did the opposite. I don't usually take the petty route, but this time it felt amazing", "Why do people try to do the full 180 acting like you have memory loss and won't remember the conversations? \n\nGlad he's your ex as well!", "To clarify, I am not currently in the hospital. That was a couple months ago. I had slowly been talking to them again once I was well enough to come home as I wasnt able to keep up with them when I was in there. I don't understand how caring if someone tries to ruin my character makes me an AH? Please explain that part further.", "So let me get this straight.  He lies to the friend group about you but when you tell the truth, with evidence of what really transpired, he's hurt that you called him out?  What an AH \n\ndefinitely NTA", "I am so proud of you. That was epic.  \n\nHe did it because he's an asshole.", "I can see where both of you are coming from. And you make a valid point that it's always fair to set the record straight.

So are these like all online only friendships/relationships with other gamer people?", "Maybe that was harsh-you\u2019re not really an AH for caring-but don\u2019t care anyways. If these people were worth being friends with they would of looked beyond the ex saying things in a break up. You wouldn\u2019t need to show \u2018proof\u2019 after the fact-cuz they would of shut that crap down.", "Basically yes. And before I found out he had done this, he had taken the opportunity to vent to me about me. About every inadvertent thing I'd said or done to hurt him during our relationship and that he believes I don't actually like men and am a sexist to men because I am wary of men I do not know. And I just let him say it while constantly apologizing and validating his feelings towards things like that.", "Lol thank you! It was the most powerful I've ever felt. To be able to actually have a \"Well actually what happened was\" moment!", "It's nice that you do, but he doesn't have the same concern about hurting you. \n\nYou are redressing the balance here, not starting something to hurt him. He hurt you and you are allowed to say, \"that thing you did - that was hurtful to me because it was a lie.\"\n\nYou don't have to accept being hurt to be the bigger person. It's ok to tell the facts of the situation and walk away.", "Some of them are online only, and some are people I know in real life. But yes, it's great for connecting to other gamers as well", "I did respond to another comment saying that at this point, I don't care if I do get that whole group back.

What a jerk", "Out of curiosity, what has been the friend group's reaction to your evidence of what really transpired?  are you back in the group and he's out?", "My video game skills ended with Sega as a kid haha. Other than commenting on like a Reddit post which is anonymous I am way too wary to talk to people I don\u2019t know online. When I was in middle school I believe we watched this movie \u201cStrangeland\u201d that scared the f out of me. Oh and by the way good riddance, on to better things for you!", "I rarely read the comments under the initial posts-so I didn\u2019t see. But that circle sounds flakey. Anyone that bases their connections on gossip doesn\u2019t seem like people worthy of your time. And even if you have been out of the hospital a bit-if it was for mental health-good friends would not bring a bunch of hearsay and drama that could harm your recovery to you.", "I've had one friend completely ignore me, another reach out to get my whole side, and another who completely forgives him but still blames me for him not talking to her. One friend had my back from the start, before any of this happened and never believed what he said. The 2 others have yet to say anything. Honestly though, at this point I don't care about getting back in the friend group or him being out. This has showed me the insanity that can happen based on word of mouth. So I will stick with my couple of close friends who didn't believe the lies and move on from the others. I was more worried about just clearing my name because I try my best to be nice to everyone and non judgmental. So I hated that they believed him without a second thought for my character", "Smart.  Surround yourself with true friends, the rest aren't necessary", "ESH. This is middle school crap. All couples say things to each other about people they wouldn't say to their faces.

This should be filed under \u201cdon\u2019t start nothin\u2019, won\u2019t be nothin\u2019\u201d \ud83d\ude0e. Go completely NC with this guy now - he showed you who he is and it\u2019s a toxic mess.", "NTA. You're doing what he tried to do, just more successfully.", "NTA.\n\nYou are clearly a people pleaser as evidenced by your willingness to put up with his moody behavior and the fact that you kept trying to make it better ***for him***, when you were the one who was in the hospital which was NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nPeople like your ex are attracted to people like you because you feed their egos and do all the work to keep the relationship viable. \n\nYou need to realize that your exes behavior was PREMEDITATED. The whole let's stay friends bit was for his benefit so that you wouldn't make a fuss and make him feel bad. He deliberately sabotaged you with the friend group so that you were the bad guy when he failed  to stay engaged with them. He's now trying to make you feel bad that you found your spine and didn't let him get away with it.\n\nI think now is a good time for some self-reflection. Have other romantic relationships followed the same pattern (e.g., getting dumped unexpectedly, apologizing for stuff that is not your fault)?  Or is it a one-off and you got taken in by a smooth operator? \n\nBecause if it is a pattern, people will continue to take advantage of you if you let them.", "NTA And it sounds like it may be a good thing you're out of that relationship. Correcting a vicious lie never ever, makes you an a****** .", "FAFO\n\nNTA", "NTA. He needs to learn the important life rule: \u201cDon\u2019t start shit, won\u2019t be shit.\u201d\n\nHe started spewing lies and half-truths, you showed the facts. Maybe he\u2019ll think next time before he does stupid shit.", "Nta.\nYou had a lucky escape", "NTA. Am I the only one who marvels at the modern way to prove justice over he said/she said with archived screen shots instead of the old fashioned way of real life verbal smears? Kudos to you, dear.", "ESH except for that girl you slut-shamed. Are you sure that y'all are 26-27 years old?", "He FA&FO, OP, and you're NTA.", "NTA", "Nta", "Nta. He started it", "Nta you are a legend for that", "As John Adams said \"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\u201d\n\nA super rationalizer cannot be reasoned with.  But this does not make him/her right.  Based on your post, I vote no you TA.", "NTA is this guy Josh from Boston? Because this is almost the exact situation I was in a couple year ago. Guy really blamed me for making his friends not like him and when I said \"they don't like you because you treime like shit in front of them\" he blew up. You're absolutely so much better off without this loser. He just wants to bitch about everyone behind everyone's back and I'm sure it's a lot to handle rn, but you and your friends are ultimately so much better off without him.", "Definitely NTA! You wouldn\u2019t have had to \u201ccall him out like that\u201d if he hadn\u2019t lied and tried to make you out to be some sort of villain. You were just defending yourself after he tried to scapegoat you to get his friends back causing you to lose friends. \n\nEdit-were from we\u2019re", "This. OP, I had a BF I broke up with when I was younger. He went to college with our friend group and told everyone I cheated. When I found out, I cleared it up with people, but I also called him and asked him why he said that after we ended things nicely. His response was, \"What was I SUPPOSED to say? That you just fell out of love with me.\" Like, yeah, the truth. \n\nI still wish I would have recorded him and played it for everyone, because I'm sure some of them still think I cheated on him...\n\nGood job clearing it up. He made a tangled web of lies, let him untangle them.", "I obviously understand what you're saying, since it's human nature, but there's literally no such thing as **justified revenge**. You can try to justify it, but that doesn't mean it's justified. You literally even admitted that OP could have walked away but \"revenge is so much sweeter\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sub isn't about whether you're justified in being an AH...it's about whether you **were an AH**. In this case, she was. Sure, I would easily say I might do something similar and I understand her reasons...but it's still a petty AH move to go through the trouble to make him look bad just because he hurt you.", "I do agree with this. If I didn't ask him/encourage him to hang out with/talk to his friends then I would feel worse. But there were so many times I did that and he denied having friends or wanting to talk to anyone else", "I have a feeling it\u2019s a purely online relationship and purely online friend group and it sounds exhausting", "He could have just apologized for losing touch with them and be done with that. Most people would understand to a degree. Definitely no need for a smear campaign", "I have no idea why this made me giggle, but it did. Thank you, I am done with most of them", "Truly is the best way to live", "Agreed. I did this after others suggested the blocking route", "Haha thank you for the title! I did believe in this instance it was the right thing to do. But I don't like to make a habit of being petty!", "I have already said, in other comments on this post, that I said that to him over a call once before knowing a situation. And apologized profusely to the person when she confronted me. I didn't make it a habit of doing it. And have already spent the time thinking about the group dynamic and decided it is best to be done with it. I do not agree that my behavior is immature, he spoke blatant lies and had people accuse me of horrible things. I am not someone to sit there and take that. If you're not someone willing to stand up for yourself then that's fine, but I do nkt believe standing up for myself by giving the bare minimum to clear my name is immature. Thank you for your feedback though", "And you know these \u201cflings\u201d are 100% online", "I was curious why no one is pointing that out, lmao.", "He 1000% could have been honest. I have been totally open when anyone has asked me about things he said. And of course he is not fully to blame for the breakup. It takes two to make and break a relationship. But I was under the impression that we would communicate to each other about that stuff. Except he did not and instead ended things and went to talk to others about me instead. I would have loved genuine honesty", "First of all, that is absolutely horrible that he did that to you! I never understand the exaggeration people use after a break up. I am very glad that you don't miss them after 10 years!\n\nI agree, I still have friends on discord and irl that I am really close with, who were not part of that friend group. And they have been amazing through the whole thing.", "I'm sorry what? How is this happening again?", "You two broke up but had mutual friends. That usually lead to a very informal custody share of said friends.\n\nWhat he tried to do was to manipulate your friends into picking only him by tarnishing your reputation. It's akin to parental alienation, really. He got caught and couldn't believe you wouldn't just let him keep all the friends at your expense.\n\nNTA.", "Bro got lucky with a lass that wanted him to not just spend all his time on her and game with his other mates too sometimes and still made her look like an asshole. Damn talk about being a right jackass and taking advantage of a good thing.\nSo my vote, you're definitely not the asshole going based off this context \ud83d\ude02", "This is classic f'around and find out... NTA and well done.", "YEP at 27 I would expect a lot more maturity than this. NTA OP", "OP isn't the only one who dodged a bullet.", "Other story:\n\nOne day he came home from work and said:\nHe: one of my female colleague was watching me.\nMe: I didn't want to hear it.\nHe: I wanted you to know it.\n\nThat was all. \nLater I was thinking about it and realized that until that time I wasn't jealous at all, but after it I was uncertain. \nAnd that was what he wanted to reach.", "He was sweet and kind to lure you in. You see who he really is now. And yeah it usually feels good to put a bully in their place, you did the right thing.", "He told you what you wanted to hear. Think about it.", "I honestly thought yall were a bunch of teenagers. They all sound immature af. You'll be better off without all the drama.", " \n\nIt's worth keeping the friend who contacted and asked for your favor first.", "Being from south East Missouri, I screamed at the Lambert's reference \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Something I recently learned that kinda blew my self-identity as a rather independent person up: one of the big signs of codependency is being unwilling to let people suffer from the consequences of their own actions, because you don\u2019t want them to be hurt. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s definitely the case in *this* situation, but as someone who also \u201cseriously hate[s] hurting people\u201d it\u2019s a good thing to keep an eye on.", "He hurt himself. You didn't do anything. He got lazy about maintaining his friendships and then lied to them about your relationship to get back together with them as if nothing happened. He might have thought that all he was doing was making up excuses to fix his friendships but really he was making you out to be abusive. That's a serious allegation, and depending on where you are, and where you work, they could have really made your life miserable if they wanted to. You are absolutely in the right to set the record straight with proof. \n\nIf he only wanted his friends back, he should have taken the hard road of building the friendships back up.", "Um no, he deserved it. I thought justified A H because it caused drama in your friend group when you could have just walked away from these people who\u2019d believe his lies so readily. But you probably saved them from his narcissistic manipulation too. The way he put that one girl down so badly but then ran to her so quickly was probably because he actually liked her so she\u2019d could have been his next relationship victim. No OP, you should sleep well knowing you did the right thing.", "Beautiful,\n\nTake this in the spirit it is offered - don\u2019t confuse being a doormat with being nice. \n\nThink about the hurt he has caused you and his \u201cfriends\u201d already being twofaced. And imagine all the pain he could have caused his friends in the future had you not given them the receipts. It\u2019s his own actions that have caused the pain, not you.", "FYI, it was originally for gamers, but it's kind of morphed into a combo of Slack and old Yahoo chats. There's subs and content creators I follow that have their own discords on politics, mental health, writing, etc. You can also set up a Discord for IRL groups. Our friend group did this for a D&D homebrew game/social activities.\n\nThere's something there for us older people too! Lol", "Close to your age. You\u2019re not missing anything, it\u2019s just an internet chat platform full of anime gamer kids and some are full of scam artists. I\u2019ve also worked places where coworkers have discords full of friends and they all chat/game outside of work.", "He is a bad friend who messed up his relationships and tried to lie his way into forgiveness. While destroying your reputation. Your friends deserve a heads up about your ex's true self \u2014 if he lied so easily and horribly about you, what else could he do just to save face?", "You are absolutely right to be wary of people you don't know, regardless of their gender. Unfortunately, men pose a greater physical risk to women and it's only logical that women would be more wary of strange men than strange women.", "Ah, so you made him feel like less of a man I see. You must be smarter, make more money, and have your stuff together. Good for you for dodging that incel bullet. Keep being yourself and don't apologize for being who you are. He attempted to take your friends from you to make himself feel bigger and validated. You took it from him (awesome you did it) and he is butt hurt.\n\nQuery: what game do you play? I am a Football Manager nut.", "LOL if it CAN be destroyed by the truth it DESERVES to be destroyed. Home boy did this to himself and you just sped up the collapse. Good for you girl! This is why keeping receipts is always a good idea.", "Ug good bye to that garbage. What a very bad dude", "Such projection. *He* doesn\u2019t like *women*.", "I had an ex like this. The minute he knew it was over he went running to as many mutuals and even MY MOM crying or drunk as pitiful as possible to try to get them on \"his side\" with whatever warped version of the truth he could sling. \n\nHave you ever noticed your ex seemed to enjoy subtly mentioning how terrible other people are or spilling their dirty laundry and encouraging you to get mad about what others supposedly did or said? Bc my ex did that and boy did he like to stir shit with people. Like he actively enjoyed when i thought my friends hated me (and vice versa). He would even misconstrue out of context screenshots as \"proof.\" It's such a dirty narcissistic isolation tactic.\n\nReally glad you got out of there. He sounds like my ex and if he's anything like my ex you dodged a huge massive bullet there. NTA also for standing up for yourself, but in the future if he doubles down and your friends actually believe him fully you may want to consider it a lost cause. Fighting it is just exhausting. The people who believe in you will believe in you.", "It sounds like you truly dodged a bullet.  Congratulations?", "Keep it up.", "Yass. This. Being unwilling to hurt bullies and narcissists who intentionally cause you pain is like baring your neck for a serial killer. It's healthy to take care of yourself and healthy to want to thrive and survive. Defending yourself is loving yourself. The instinct not to hurt is a positive indication to yourself that you are not a narcissist or wantonly cruel. But you still have to act if someone/something is hurting you. Took me too many years to learn. Hope you can also find that space, OP.", "Interesting. Thank you for this, I will genuinely think about this comment and keep an eye on that", "He is already there. He wore the mask for as long as he could but could not do it anymore.", "Haha love the hesitation in that congrats. Thank you nonetheless", "You are right. I grew up with a narcissistic mother and only was able to defend myself years and years being out of that house. I will try my best to try and remember that sometimes people getting hurt isnt my fault or responsibility and can be a consequence of their actions", "That's actually the cool thing about Discord, as much as my personal server has like 3 dozen people on it, I'd say only 5 maybe I don't know well cause they're just friends of a friend. You can join big servers if you want, but you can also make just a solo one for yourself and fill it full of all your notes! Or funny memes, or links. Or you can make a small one and share it only with your 5 closest friends. It's kind of like a personal forum/chat.\n\nAnyway, you can use the internet how you like and your method is equally valid, I just wanted to advocate for the tiny server discord experience. It's kind of like an extremely tiny social media that only goes to people you trusted to invite. As someone who's very bad at Facebook etc it works for me. And all my friends get my latest cat photo anyway XD\n\nAnyway, have a nice day!"]}
