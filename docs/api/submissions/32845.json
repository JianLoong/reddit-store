Your house, your rules. If she's upset about the cost, whoever offered you the money to board the cats could direct those funds to her.

Part of responsible dog ownership is figuring your shit out.", "*My Uncle even offered to send money to board our cats.*\n\nWhy can't he just...pay to board the dog? NTA", "NTA.\n\nFirst, boarding her dog is not the only option. Dog walkers and such are also an option.  We have a teen coming to look after our multiple pets for a week.\n\nSecond, bringing a dog into the cats' space will be hard on the cats EVEN if they are in another room/basement.  Chances are, they will also destroy something since they aren't used to being cooped up.  And they are likely to get out with people coming and going- which could lead to them OR THE DOG getting hurt.\n\nThird of all, it is MUCH harder on cats to be in boarding than dogs.  Cats do NOT like to change environments.  Cats in kennels can experience exceptional amounts of stress (obviously varies by cat).\n\nFourth, if money is the issue, then Uncle can pay the money to have Fido be boarded - problem solved.\n\nFifth, she is coming for a long visit and that's a huge imposition - not like she's coming over for dinner and asking you to let the dog in for a couple hours.\n\nFor the record, I have three cats and one dog at the moment.  The 40ish pound dog is terrified of the 10 pound cat and is the most likely to get hurt.", "NTA. Why is your uncle offering to pay to board your cats rather than paying to board his daughter's dog? All of their suggestions for what to do with your cats during the holiday are entirely unreasonable and while it's sad that your father is disappointed they won't be coming to Christmas dinner, it isn't your fault. They are the ones choosing to put their desire to force you to accommodate your cousin's dog for no good reason over spending time with their family on the holidays.", "NTA - it's your cat's house (you just pay the mortgage). Even if you didn't have pets, you are not obligated to house a large dog if you don't want to. Your cousin can either board her dog or stay home.\n\nFor real though, stress can make cats physically ill. I once tried to introduce my cat (who was raised with dogs) to a new dog and he stress vomited for days. The minute the dog left, he was fine. Cats can also get stress-induced cystitis which is a medical emergency and is extremely painful.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t your uncle pay for boarding the dog? Your cousin is the AH, she is acting like an entitled immature human being. Have your uncle pay for the dog\u2019s boarding", "NTA, but your entire family is. Put the cats in the basement? Why can\u2019t they send her money to hire a dog sitter? People always want to bully others to see if they\u2019ll cave. Stand strong.", "NTA. She expects you to lock your cats in the basement but she won\u2019t board her own dog? Your aunt and uncle are AH too for suggesting you board your cats. It is their home.", "NTA.\n\nAnd the fact that she's badmouthing you on social media should really mean that she isn't welcome in your home any longer, with or without her dog.", "Why can\u2019t aunt and uncle accommodate the dog at their home? It\u2019s always the mouthiest people who won\u2019t actually step up to the plate.  NTA.", "How fucked up is a Great Dane that everyone hates the dog?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

The uncle should have moved to cover his daughter's boarding for the dog in the first place!", "Or, if they like the dog so much, why can't they take it (or even cousin and dog)?  Maybe they don't have the space.  \n\nBoarding the cats would be a bit like saying to OP, \"I'm gunna come visit, and stay at your place, but you have to leave your HOME and stay elsewhere while I am there, ok?\"  Why should the cats leave their HOME so that another animal can stay there?", "I do Rover on the side and sent her some sitters that were near her. She doesn't trust them to take care of her baby.", "Depending upon where they are it could be that expensive.  Sometimes boarding my dog is as expensive as a vacation.", "Sorry my bad. My Aunt is my dad's sister.", "Usually my parents host, but can't this year because of his surgery. My cousin doesn't usually come as she normally has to work the holidays. This year, she got the holiday off and doesn't want to leave her dog behind. My father and Aunt spoke and she let us know that cousin would be attending.", "I have a small dog and she doesn't get to visit where she isn't welcome.", "And it is way more disruptive to cats to board them than it is to a dog that is obviously used to traveling.", "Then I would just tell her sorry, and you'll miss her at this years gathering, because it's obvious she values her dog's company much more than she does the humans in her life.", "Why isn\u2019t she staying with her parents? Why can\u2019t her parents baby sit dog at least? Why don\u2019t her parents pay to board her dog?", "Wow.  You\u2019ve gone above and beyond then by offering reasonable alternatives.  I cannot believe the audacity of folks being a guest in someone\u2019s home and telling them what to do with their pets.  W.  T.  F.  \n\nNTA.", "So your cousin wants you lock your cats im the basement or board them, but she doesn\u2019t trust a dog sitter with her horse? Your cousin is the AH", "That is INSANE! I mean, I can understand her reluctance to board then... But if it was me and my boyos, I still just would say I couldn't go, rather than try guilt anyone into letting them also stay!", "In that case, no.\nBut it's also not very nice to exclude someone if you have a reasonable space to dog-proof where the dog can't get in to contact with the cats, and of course if they take care of and clean up after the dog.", "Exactly.  Then I\u2019d be happy that I didn\u2019t have to go somewhere and be social.", "Why do people need to dog-proof their spaces for a dog that doesn\u2019t live at their home? \nThey weren\u2019t excluding the cousin, just the horse dog. \n\nI have my own dogs and I have said no to my mum brining her dog to my house.", "No, it's not. Yes, it's a very kind thing to be willing to house someone else's pet(s), but it is by no means an obligation. No one should be expected to dog-proof their house. OP also isn't excluding anhone-the cousin is free to board their dogs, hire a sitter, rent a room at a pet-free hotel, or find some other accommodations. Part of taking on the responsibility of being a pet owner is realizing that your pet may not be invited everywhere, and you have to decide whether to fork out for boarding/sitting or stay home.", "You absolutely don't need to do that. It's however a noce thing to do."]}
