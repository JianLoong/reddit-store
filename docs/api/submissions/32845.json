We have a teen coming to look after our multiple pets for a week.\n\nSecond, bringing a dog into the cats' space will be hard on the cats EVEN if they are in another room/basement.  Chances are, they will also destroy something since they aren't used to being cooped up.  And they are likely to get out with people coming and going- which could lead to them OR THE DOG getting hurt.\n\nThird of all, it is MUCH harder on cats to be in boarding than dogs.  Cats do NOT like to change environments.  Cats in kennels can experience exceptional amounts of stress (obviously varies by cat).\n\nFourth, if money is the issue, then Uncle can pay the money to have Fido be boarded - problem solved.\n\nFifth, she is coming for a long visit and that's a huge imposition - not like she's coming over for dinner and asking you to let the dog in for a couple hours.\n\nFor the record, I have three cats and one dog at the moment.  The 40ish pound dog is terrified of the 10 pound cat and is the most likely to get hurt.", "NTA. Why is your uncle offering to pay to board your cats rather than paying to board his daughter's dog? All of their suggestions for what to do with your cats during the holiday are entirely unreasonable and while it's sad that your father is disappointed they won't be coming to Christmas dinner, it isn't your fault. They are the ones choosing to put their desire to force you to accommodate your cousin's dog for no good reason over spending time with their family on the holidays.", "NTA - it's your cat's house (you just pay the mortgage). Even if you didn't have pets, you are not obligated to house a large dog if you don't want to. Your cousin can either board her dog or stay home.\n\nFor real though, stress can make cats physically ill. I once tried to introduce my cat (who was raised with dogs) to a new dog and he stress vomited for days. The minute the dog left, he was fine. Cats can also get stress-induced cystitis which is a medical emergency and is extremely painful.", "NTA. Why doesn\u2019t your uncle pay for boarding the dog?

Maybe they don't have the space.  \n\nBoarding the cats would be a bit like saying to OP, \"I'm gunna come visit, and stay at your place, but you have to leave your HOME and stay elsewhere while I am there, ok?\"  Why should the cats leave their HOME so that another animal can stay there?", "I do Rover on the side and sent her some sitters that were near her.

I mean, I can understand her reluctance to board then... But if it was me and my boyos, I still just would say I couldn't go, rather than try guilt anyone into letting them also stay!", "In that case, no.\nBut it's also not very nice to exclude someone if you have a reasonable space to dog-proof where the dog can't get in to contact with the cats, and of course if they take care of and clean up after the dog.", "Exactly.  Then I\u2019d be happy that I didn\u2019t have to go somewhere and be social.", "Why do people need to dog-proof their spaces for a dog that doesn\u2019t live at their home? \nThey weren\u2019t excluding the cousin, just the horse dog. \n\nI have my own dogs and I have said no to my mum brining her dog to my house.", "No, it's not. Yes, it's a very kind thing to be willing to house someone else's pet(s), but it is by no means an obligation. No one should be expected to dog-proof their house. OP also isn't excluding anhone-the cousin is free to board their dogs, hire a sitter, rent a room at a pet-free hotel, or find some other accommodations. Part of taking on the responsibility of being a pet owner is realizing that your pet may not be invited everywhere, and you have to decide whether to fork out for boarding/sitting or stay home.", "You absolutely don't need to do that. It's however a noce thing to do.", "NTA", "NTA They want YOU to put your cats in the basement or board them? Nope.. and the damage her dog could do in 5 days in your home can exceed the $1000.00 to board him. Your aunt and uncle choosing not to come is on them not you. It is the fault of the dog. Hotels do not take the dog either. You cousin needs to realize that not all of us are dog friendly. My own son cannot bring his dog over in the house as our cats are not dog friendly and he only brings his dog by if we are doing stuff out bag especially because as cute and tiny as he is he is a pisspot if he gets excited or scared.. We have new floors, etc after our pisspot died so no more dogs.. The cats have their litter boxes in a upstairs room with a protected section of floor just in case.", "NTA\u2026why can\u2019t she stay with her mom and dad?  She has options.  She chooses not to use them.  That is on her.   And if Uncle is willing to pay to board your cats, why isn\u2019t he willing to pay to board his own daughter\u2019s dog?", "NTA.  Why should your cats leave THEIR home or be locked up in THEIR home just to accommodate her?  That\u2019s BS.  She can board the dog, hire a dog sitter or just not come.  Her choice.  It\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA! So your cousin and her parents think that you need to either lock up your cats from their home or board them  but she herself can\u2019t board her dog. Let the dog stay with her parents. Once again NTA !", "NTA. I have 2 cat-friendly(ish) dogs, and I wouldn't dream of taking them to someone's house without them offering.

My SIL is hosting this year. We all live within 90 minutes of each other, so not a huge commute to travel. My SIL has her own dog.

We won't stay too late since we don't want to leave him for too long, but he's not coming. That is her house and I respect it. Much like I meet my out of town brother somewhere else so my dog doesn't make his allergies go full bore asthma. It's about respect and your cousin doesn't have any for you and your home.", "NTA. You\u2019re under no obligation to accommodate her dog or displace your cats. And if your uncle is willing to pay to board your cats, he should be willing to help pay to accommodate her dog.\n\nHowever, I can understand your cousin\u2019s hesitation to board her dog right now especially, as there\u2019s a horrible and apparently very contagious canine respiratory illness going around and vets are cautioning people against letting their dogs be around other dogs, including not boarding their dogs if they can avoid it. So she may be trying to avoid boarding the dog for that reason, too, and it might be better - but also way more expensive - for her to find a dog-sitter to stay with him.\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t mean you need to displace your cats or host a dog if you\u2019re not comfortable doing that. But it may at least partially explain the expense of dog care right now.", "NTA. Your cousin is extremely entitled. Why can't her parents pay for the dog to be boarded instead of your cats??", "NTA. I'd respond to the post about your cats, her suggestion to lock them up in the basement and the whole family refusing to have her dog. Why are they picking on you only? Are you an easier target?", "NTA your Uncle should be giving his child & her dog a place to stay, not you!", "Too bad. Stay home with your dog.

If they love the dog so much, why isn\u2019t she staying with *them*???", "OP is not excluding someONE, he's excluding a dog. Dogs are not included in most invitations.
