She has a son, Michael who is 18. We get along pretty well. He's a good kid with a great head on his shoulders.\n\nThis past year, my wife and I welcomed our first biological child together, Sarah. We're going through the process of updating our wills, which means choosing guardians in the event that both of us died. When Michael was younger, Denise had her parents listed, but they're now older and in no condition to take care of a baby. We asked my sister and her husband, they agreed.\n\nWe were explaining some things to Michael that came along with the will (insurance goes to him if we both pass, what he'd inherit, etc). We also explained that there was an account set up for him to get his own apartment once he finished college (he's currently a freshman), should we both pass by then. (Unlikely, but all bases covered sort of thing)\n\nMichael then asked what would happen to Sarah. We told him our guardian choices. Michael straightened up and said that no, he would take on Sarah. I said that was very sweet, but he was still very young. Maybe we'd consider updating it in 10 or so years when he's older and more established. My wife said we'd think about it.\n\nIn private, I asked if she was seriously considering it. She pointed out that Michael spends a lot of time with her, is a good kid, etc and is volunteering. I said I wouldn't feel comfortable putting the fate of our daughter in the hands of a young adult. I said if Denise was changing her mind on my sister and brother-in-law, that was completely fine but to me, Michael is not an option and it should be a \"two yes, one no wins\" situation. She asked if it would really be so mad for Michael to become guardian and I laughed. While yes, Michael is volunteering, he has no real clue what would come with being a parent. As I said, in 10 years, when he's more established and an adult, I'd consider it. For now, it needs to be someone else.\n\nDenise isn't upset that I don't want Michael to be the guardian, but she is upset over how dismissive I'm being and that I laughed at her.

For now, it needs to be someone else.\n\nCorrect.\n\nYTA though because:\n\n> how dismissive I'm being and that I laughed at her.", "YTA for laughing. She was being serious, she has valid reasons. I\u2019m not saying you should change your mind, but you shouldn\u2019t be so dismissive. Also, since it\u2019s your side of the family taking Sarah, are you willing to put visit provisions in the will so Micheal won\u2019t lose touch? You may not think it\u2019s likely, but Michael could be worried about something like that.", "Yes, YTA for your approach. \n\n18yos adopt their younger sibs all the time. Just because Michael isn't ready today doesn't make him a joke. That's his sister and he doesn't want to be separated from her if something happens to you. That's noble and thoughtful, and dare I say it - mature. \n\nYou should have handled his inquiry with much more empathy and kindness.", "YTA\n\nYou're not only being condescending and dismissive, you've also just told your wife \"I don't think you've raised someone capable of looking after his sister and I'd rather break up our blended family unit than give him the chance to try\"\n\nNot thrusting the responsibility for a child upon him is one thing, but if he's responsible enough to ask, you should at least do him the courtesy of discussing it. Your sister and her husband could always take over or help out if it *does* become too much for him.", "YTA - How would you not be the asshole for laughing at your wife? You implied that you think that Michael is so irresponsible and can\u2019t be trusted to look after his sister. Why wouldn\u2019t she be offended when she thinks that you don\u2019t trust her son?", "YTA, either you're reasonably old parents of a newborn or your wife was a reasonably young mom. By implying her son would be incapable of being a good Guardian I imagine your wife is feeling like your invalidating her experience of motherhood and implying she was a bad parent.", "YTA. I think you\u2019re making the right choice concerning guardians, but the way you reacted was rude and dismissive. \n\nYour step-son is clearly concerned about the possibility of his sister being taken away from him, and deserves the respect of a serious conversation about the pros and cons for both your children if he was the guardian (financial security, his education and ability to establish his career, etc). You can also work to figure out conditions that would help him to feel more secure (ex. Guaranteed visitation, holidays)", "YTA. You\u2019re not completely wrong to be concerned with the idea and even veto it, but laughing and being dismissive was completely uncalled for. He sounds like a wonderful person and you should be very grateful that your child has an older brother who is responsible and loving to volunteer for that responsibility, even at 18. So stop being an asshole to your wife about it.", "YTA - not for questioning if your stepson understands  fully what responsibilities come with raising children. As an informed adult and parent, I get where you are coming from.\n\nHowever, the way you dismissed your wife is appalling. You laughed at her when she brought up the possibility that her son, who\u2019s 18, offered to take his own sister. She raised that boy and he wants to put his life on the line for his sister in the case where you both pass away. I don\u2019t know many young adults who would do that. She\u2019s taught him to value his family and if that was my kid I would seriously think about it too. \n\nShe did good with him, and you just laughed at her.", "YTA both for your attitude, laughing at your wife, and arguing with people here who disagree with you. Guess what? Lots of us think you're an AH!", "YTA for laughing and being dismissive. I understand why you might not want Michael to be the guardian but your reaction wasn\u2019t cool. On the bright side, you have a lot of people, including Michael, who love your daughter so much they would be willing to take care of her if anything ever happened. Don\u2019t just be dismissive of that.", "YTA. Nothing makes me more upset than when I'm discussing a serious thing with my partner and he has the audacity to laugh. There was no need to do that. I think you're right that's a two yeses situation, but there's nothing wrong with her talking up her son. She's obviously proud of him, he's obviously a good kid, and it's okay for you to be opposed to him being your younger child's guardian should the worst happen, but don't laugh at someone in a serious conversation. Rude. Since you can't come up with it on your own and it would have been perfect to deflect the situation, \"I think it's so sweet he loves and cares for his baby half sister but I can't imagine saddling him with the responsibility of raising someone else's child at such a young age, even in this unlikely scenario.\" It takes the spin from \"lol you're just a young ignorant kid,\" to \"I want to be sure you have the opportunity to live and enjoy your younger years without that added responsibility.\"", "Look, you need to realize that a child isn't an object you can will to someone. No matter who you say you want to have the kids, that's just a factor for consideration of who gets custody, not the end of the line. Other factors include \"who wants custody\", and \"who's guardianship would be least disruptive to the child's current life\", and \"whose custody is generally best for the child emotionally and physically,\" and \"who the child prefers to be with\" (when the child is old enough) ect ect.\n\nYour \"this is who I want my child to be with\" is a factor, and it's your final decision you really get to offer your opinion on for your child, but you seem to be taking this possibility overly literally and overly seriously? No matter what you say, Michael may or may not end up with the child if you died tomorrow.", "Since you\u2019re only asking for a judgment on your reaction, YTA.  You WERE being dismissive and condescending.  You could\u2019ve communicated the same opinion in a mature, thoughtful way.", "YTA. So much. Do you have any idea what a gift this boy has given you with this?  He wants his half sister and wants to care for her. Extraordinary.\n\nYoung adult children take on guardianship of younger siblings every day and have for as long as we have had the concept of family. Why not make him the guardian with your sibling as a co-guardian so they make the decisions as a family for his sister? Why not both? In ten years your sister may not even want the responsibility. Or your son may not. It would not hurt a thing to speak to your attorney and work this out so he is part of her life if you both die.", "YTA for laughing. Totally get not having your stepson be a guardian in his early 20s but laughing was wrong. It's not unreasonable at all to revisit the plan in the future (my wife and I do that every few years cause things in life change).", "YTA", "YTA for laughing, yes.", "A bit of an AH for laughing but not AH for  your reasoning as to the guardianship , you're right in that.", "YTA\n\nPeople become parents at 18 and cope fine. From your post there are not any known pressing health conditions that make the two of you more likely to have issues looking after your daughter. As he gets older so will she and if he is around her often assisting in looking after her then if the worst happens it will be an easier transition for her.", "YTA.\n\nYou clearly mean well, but all your wife and stepson will get from this is that you don't trust him.", "YTA, you should be ecstatic that your daughters brother wants to be her guardian if shit hits the fan. having the next closest person to her stay with her is best case scenario if something happens to you two.", " YTA other than Michael being young do you really have a good reason for not considering him?", "NTA - he's too young since you have other options. What if something happened to the two of you in the next year. Would your wife expect Michael to drop out of school and abandon his future plans for his life in order to care for an infant?\n\nCan there be something that gives him more of a ceremonial role in her life - like a god parent or something similar, while leaving the burden of child rearing to your sister and husband? \n\nalthough minor YTA if you were indeed dismissive which caused the hurt feelings. Explain you are thinking as much for Michael's well being as you are your daughter.", "NTA. I hope the situation is purely a hypothetical one, but I imagine the reality is that him being her guardian at 18 would seriously affect his life more so than it would your sisters. Maybe you came across as dismissive for laughing, if so hold your hands up to that. But your wife must realise the sacrifices involved in raising a child - money, home, schools, transport - that her son would need to make are a lot to impose on any 18 year old.", "YTA completely for how you handled it. You are condescending and come off as a know it all AH. You have a son and a brother who shows great maturity in wanting to step up and be there for his sister. Is that wise when there are other options? No but for you to laugh and just dismiss his gesture and what he is willing to sacrifice to be there for his sister is just fucked up. He was willing to give up the rest of his youth and sacrifice and you just laugh. So yeah do not make him the guardian but the way you handled it makes him the mature one at 18 and you an AH and a child for the way you dismiss him.", "YTA not for your choice in guardian because you guys know Michael and his abilities best but you were incredibly rude and dismissive of your wife regarding this.", "YTA for laughing also YTA for not considering him if this world and the internet has taught us anything it\u2019s that even the most stable looking people can be in a bad situation in private. 10 years or now he should still be an option already because older guardians will just get older just like the parents did and you had to update. If you\u2019re really planning for your after death situation then you need plan A, B, and C for that baby he should be an option because that\u2019s her brother. If you\u2019re planning this guardianship all on what ifs, what if you, your wife and your sister and your BIL all die together? What happens to baby girl then?", "NTA you\u2019re all valid and mean well. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like ya crushed his soul but were reasonable by saying you\u2019d reconsider in the future. \n\nI am biased tho cause I believe giving a young adult a baby could be detrimental to the future of both lives. But that\u2019s just my opinion and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s many instances where I\u2019m wrong", "NTA\n\nIt IS sweet, but taking on the responsibility of a toddler while he is a college student is not what is best for either of them!  Why would she want that for Michael?  (I know someone who gained custody of her then 11-yo sister at 21, dropped out out of college to raise her, and this girl JUST finished high school - and she was 11, not a baby!)\n\nI think you have the right idea.  It's a heavy thing to have to think about (and some people go to very dark places just considering their own deaths), so maybe cut Denise some slack for getting emotions wrapped up in it.", "Gonna be the lone voice saying NAH here I guess. I would feel the same as you. I\u2019d laugh if someone suggested my 18 year old step son suddenly become a parent full time to a grieving child. That\u2019s not fair to either your step son or your child and it\u2019s not realistic for your step son to think it\u2019s a good idea either.", "NTA, you should absolutely be dismissive of this mother even forbsla second seriously contemplating her son giving up his life to care for a child when a perfectly acceptable alternative is available.  There are many who going to an older sibling is the only option and they step up which is great but this always comes with great sacrifice. Why would she want that for her son? I couldn't imagine doing that to my child when I have established family members who can care for my children. Anyone advocating for you to give him a chance is out of thier minds. Hopefully nine of this ever comes to pass but let that young man live his life, he can still be a part of his sisters life without blowing up his own.", "NTA he's 18!? Are the people in the comments on crack or something. The wife wasn't being objective. Obviously an established couple is a better bet than an 18 y old kid.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI can see why people don\u2019t like that you laughed. I think it\u2019s a little funny that your wife thought if she asked the same question again, she would get a different answer. I\u2019m assuming this was a small, involuntary chuckle, right? \n\nAnyway, good job updating wills and discussing difficult topics as a family!", "ESH. \n\nYTA for laughing, you should sit down and apologise for that. Also explain that you\u2019re not comfortable until he\u2019s older. Your point about it being two yes\u2019s is good, that\u2019s how it should be.\n\nI said ESH because I understand your point. He clearly absolutely loves his sister, but he\u2019s only 18 and doesn\u2019t actually know the responsibility he\u2019ll have if it comes down to it. Updating it in 5-10 years is a good idea.", "NAH just some wrong people. \n\nWhile it's understandable why you don't want him to be the one taking care of his sister at 18 (,and I definitely like you for that as I spent the majority of my young teen and later teen years taking care of many siblings because apparently my mom and my step father doesn't know what a condom is and that leaving a 12(Me) and 10(my little sister) year old girls to take care of 3 toddlers and 1 infant and leaving the managing of the house to a 12(me) year old while they work is not the smartest of choices), you shouldn't have laughed.\n\nYou wife has the right to be upset, and you should apologize, and should also consider how wonderful it is that your step-son was willing to take care of his sister in the event that you may pass. I'd love to switch places with him. He can happily have my life. \n\nSo again, NAH.", "NTA. He sounds like a lovely young man. But you have established adults who have agreed to become guardians if something happens to you and your wife. Even the BEST 18 year old is not equipped for solo parenthood. This is not a judgement on your wife\u2019s parenting, it\u2019s just facts.", "INFO: how old was your wife when she had her son? I\u2019m guessing she was quite young if 18 years later she\u2019s got an infant. You said he\u2019s a good kid with a good head on his shoulders - thanks to being raised by your wife who would\u2019ve been a young adult. \n\nWhy is his age an issue if he\u2019s volunteering to do it? \n\nI want to lean NAH because it should be a two yes situation, but I\u2019m really curious about why you\u2019re so against it. And I do think YTA for laughing and dismissing this so easily. You see so many stories about parents wishing half siblings would accept each other and here he is, offering to take full responsibility for his little sister and you\u2019re denying him that.", "YTA since you probably could found a way to express yourself without flat out belittling your wife.\n\nI think the bigger question here is if YOU know how to be a parent.  What you wrote above makes you sound less mature than Michael.", "Michael sounds great tbh. You however.............yta", "YTA Not choosing him isn\u2019t what makes you the AH automatically dismissing him derisively does.  18 is an adult and they raise kids all the time, nobody has a clue what being a parent is like until they are one.", "Yta. He loves that baby and he would go out of his way to do his best for her.  You are dismissive and you act like he isn't capable.\nChances are he would be much better with her than your sister.", "NTA because Michael is really just barely an adult. Does he want to go to college? Have a normal dating life? Stay out late and party with friends? If in theory you and your wife died tomorrow- his life would completely change. I think the way you approached it wasn\u2019t the best, and maybe sit down with him and your wife again and explain this is in the best interest of both Sarah and Michael. He\u2019ll still have access to her and be her brother, and he\u2019ll still get to pursue his dreams without the pressure of providing for and raising a young child. Maybe tell him you appreciate how much he loves his sister and you\u2019re so happy he\u2019s willing to raise her if anything happens, but that he\u2019s young and deserves the chance to make his own life without extra pressure. Maybe once he finishes college or gets a stable job you will definitely revisit the will if he still wants to be her guardian", "Why is OP TA for not wanting to saddle his stepson with taking care of someone else\u2019s child? If he wanted to do this y\u2019all would be UP IN ARMS about how it\u2019s not this kid\u2019s responsibility, he shouldn\u2019t have to raise his siblings, etc. NTA OP. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have laughed but I agree, he\u2019s too young and putting that kind of responsibility on someone (doesn\u2019t matter if they volunteered or not) is not okay.", "NTA - No dates for him, no social life, he'd have to get a job. That fact that he offered that way shows he has no idea. LOL, no. I'd laugh too.", "Nta it sounds like you have no faith in your stepson and think he is totally incapable of rising to the occasion of raising his half sister.

But I do believe he's mostly just being controlling and arrogant, even if he doesn't realize it.", "For laughing at her, yes.

Yeah, he shouldn't have laughed at his wife, but the idea that giving some 18-year-old a child to raise is NBD is fucking ridiculous. Especially when there is an established, financially stable stable, married aunt and uncle who have experience raising a child.", "I assume this lawyer is a wills and estates lawyer. I work in family law. It is not as rare as he seems to think. It would be a family law issue and not in his practice area at all. He likely means people rarely contest, not that they rarely win. Cause that is not true - over turning a guardianship goes to family court not probate. And people fight guardianships all the time.", "Custody isn't about \"contesting a will\" because *children cannot be willed*. They *are not a possession*. The system decide who is the best option for the child out of the people willing to do so, not fully ignoring what you've expressed, but independent of what you've expressed in your will.\n\nIf Michael wants it, he will ask for it, and as her closest relation by blood, if she's old enough that they have a close sibling bond and a physical closeness of residence to where her life is... he'd probably win? Maybe not tomorrow if you died as an eighteen year old asking for an infant, but in five years when he's graduated college and she's five or so and is emotionally close to him, I think it'd be pretty certain? With a will that was made when he was only 18? Especially if, as I suspect would be the case, your sister isn't aware that Michael would want to take care of his sister before he put his name in the hat-- lots of people would go, \"Oh, if (closer relation) wants to take care of this child, then of course *they* should do so!\" and step back themselves.\n\nFor the record, YTA for LAUGHING at her serious consideration, it doesn't sound like you discussed this respectfully.

Not that I think there is anything wrong with Michael being the guardian. Not at all. He would be a great guardian. But, he is young and I personally would try to limit that kind of responsibility on anyone, if I had another choice. \n\nMaybe sit down with Michael, and your wife, and explain to him, and show him, what it really means to be a parent. Hold nothing back. \n\nNot to scare him off parenthood, but to help him understand why you really do not want to take away his own life choices at such a young age and that you would be fully prepared to re-consider him as her guardian when he has had the opportunities to travel, party, and have his own relationships, unencumbered with this kind of responsibility. \n\nI am sure, given the fact that he is a good kid, he will still keep his offer on the table, but he will also understand that your refusal is coming from a good place, and not from a place of malice or distrust. \n\nGood luck.\n\nSorry forgot to say NTA (although YTA for laughing)", "Yeah unfortunately YTA for how you spoke to your wife.

He\u2019s 18 and has a baby sister which has to be a difficult and honestly weird adjustment & and at a very selfish age and stage of development he is being really selfless. I think that at least deserves some recognition and respect. I think it warrants at least a discussion. Should he be saddled with custody at his age? No - that wouldn\u2019t be good for him either ( not just \u201cyour\u201d daughter). Maybe even involving your sister with discussion with how he can be involved in his sisters life.

The fact that he cares that much about a half sister that is young enough to be his daughter should be appreciated.  There are plenty of people that don't feel the same way about their own siblings.\n\nThere is also the unfortunate possibility that sometime in the next 17 years, your wife, yourself, and your sister all end up passing too early.

Those 2 definitely give more of a damn about you and your daughter than you ever will for them. Maybe they're better off without someone like you.\n\nLet me explain something. In the absence of my parents, I am the \"head\" of the family and the \"general counsel\" of my two siblings regarding all matters, since I'm the eldest. My bro and I are in our early and late 30s. Sis is in her late 20s. We are all Millennials and currently single. One could say \"but you're all adults, why do you need to do this?!\". Yes we are, but some things in certain families just work that way. We dont just go our own ways simply because we're a certain age or whatever, in the absense of parents. Someone, usually the eldest, steps up to take certain reigns, depending on circumstances. Even more so if they're 18+. \n\nIn my family, its me. I had to be the eldest at barely 18 even though according to the birth order, I'm the 3rd kid, not the 1st or even the 2nd. If something had happened to our parents while my siblings were underage, I'd definitely have become the legal guardian. They're MY siblings. I wouldnt trust them or our family stuff to anyone else and vice versa. Neither do our parents. Just cannot risk that shit. So yeah. \n\nOur parents are in their 60s and 70s now. They have financial matters that I will have to handle because I'm the most capable in these regards. They also own estates in another country that will become my responsibility as well since my siblings are not at all familiar with these and what to do with them. We are heirs to everything they have however little or big. \n\nOur parents are in the process of basically handing things over to me for the 3 of us in the near future. We all grew up in Canada and I'm the only one who knows the language fluenty, the cultures, customs etc of the other country our family is from. So now I gotta start paying much more attention to everything. I'm even preparing to travel there with everyone to officially/legally be given that responsibility/rights. If something happens to either or both of our parents, everything will be be on me. Who else will it be on? Not any relative or the govt! \n\nThings like these is no laughing matter. These are serious stuff every family should think about and sort out while they still can, whether all members are biological or blended. And if someone has any problem with including the blended members of the family, everyone should really think hard about the \"closeness\" of their relationships. If I was her, you laughing and dismissing the son would make me rethink everything about you as well as my place in your life. Instead of laughing, start preparing yourselves and also the boy for his future, if you want to continue being a family.", "YTA.\nYou have said that he is a good responsible kid, and there's plenty of people in his position, at his age who would have stepped up.

How would he cope with his grief while simultaneously caring for an infant?  Yes, people figure these things out, but you already have a sister and BIL that are presumably in a much better position to care for Sarah AND have agreed to be guardians.

I ended up with grades much worse than what I was predicted and would have struggled to get into Uni based on it.\n\nOur Mum took the younger siblings abroad after a while but the damage of becoming a parent when I was still a kid had already been done. Please don't ask your son to do it until he is older. People here are saying that 18 is old enough and people start having kids that age, but they forget that it's not like he is becoming a father and having time to process fatherhood, he would instead have to be a Dad right away with no preparation and the inability to grieve over the loss of both his parents.

The main thing that makes that much harder now is the changes in economic security and it no longer being feasible to raise a family with dignity on one young adult's wage. But that is a matter that OP could solve if he wanted to. I take no issue with preferring someone more experienced in childrearing, but I don't think the concept is outrageous. (I am not a young person, BTW, I am probably a fair bit older than OP, and was raising a family not much older than OP's stepson).\n\nAlso, OP should consider that it sounds like his wife probably had her son pretty young and appears to have raised a decent young man.

If he agrees to this arrangement to appease his step son's ego and they both die in a car crash tomorrow, his daughter will be in a situation where an 18 year old freshman will have to put his life on hold to raise his half-sister. Sure, a nice gesture but it's so absolutely unnecessary when there is a better option available that will give the baby a more stable environment and will not impact the son's life as much. As a matter of fact, he will be having a hard time as is, losing his mom.\n\nIs it rude of OP to laugh? Absolutely. Is it kinda justified because his wife wants to make their daughter's emergency plan about her motherhood and her son's ability to care for his sister when the need arises (even though there would be no need)? Not really. But it's still a shitty thing to do.\n\nOP needs to apologize for his behaviour but his wife should also apologize because there is no compromise here. Either he compromises their daughter's upbringing in the worst case scenario while also significantly impacting the life of his step son or he doesn't. Maybe they could put in a clause where he takes over guardianship at a certain age or after he has finished college and has held a job for half a year or something (if that is possible).

It\u2019s a very immature reply. An adult responsible enough to care for a small child doesn\u2019t reject the wishes of the parents of said child based purely on \u201cI wanna.\u201d And I\u2019m not saying that to be mean to the step son; what he said isn\u2019t bad, it was just not very mature and that\u2019s hardly surprising as he is only 18. He\u2019s not bad for wanting to step up, he\u2019s not bad at all. He\u2019s just not acting in a mature way.  \nBut no, OP saying stepson isn\u2019t ready is nothing like saying \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve raised someone capable of looking after his sister\u201d it\u2019s saying he\u2019s just not ready.  \nThe takes in this post are honestly boggling my mind and make me assume that the majority are coming from people who have no idea what it means to raise a child. You don\u2019t have to experience parenthood to have an idea of how big of a responsibility it is.  \nIf it was another story about an 18 year old having a kid when they clearly weren\u2019t ready, people would be all over that.  \n\nThe very fact that you think someone should be willing to *risk* that their teenage son with guardianship of their baby daughter would struggle *and then* have sister step in when things are already going wrong is utterly not living in the real world.  \nLittle sister is not a toy or a training tool for her barely-adult brother to figure out whether he can handle it. She is a person who, should her parents both die, will need great support and stability from responsible adults who have more life experience than  an 18 yr old who has barely dipped a toe into adulthood. This is not a situation where you just make rash decisions to suit the feelings of others. This isn\u2019t a little girl who has no one else other than her teen brother, this is a little girl who has two parents who are in the position to make decisions that are best *for her* in case something goes wrong and no, lightly hurting brothers feelings right now is not reason enough **at all** to change that decision or even entertain it further.\n\nAnd laughing about it in private to his wife doesn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s not a laugh of thinking it\u2019s funny or making fun, it\u2019s an incredulous laugh. Because of the absurdity.

Young people can be good parents. It\u2019s also ideal for children who lose their parents to be raised by their own sibling. Not to discount that aunts and uncles and grandparents can be good guardians as well, but usually the sibling bond is deeper and siblings are together everyday due to living and growing up together in the formative years. Children don\u2019t usually have that same kind of bond with aunts and uncles or grandparents unless they are living in a multigenerational home.

He\u2019s an adult, and honestly you said he\u2019s a good young man and seemingly responsible for his age. If you both passed away there are certainly ways to set things up for them.  That said, I get it, he\u2019s young and you have two people who could provide an option you\u2019re more comfortable with right now.  That said, I imagine his fear is also losing contact with her and not having the same relationship if she\u2019s then living elsewhere so I might consider how to quell some of those things.", "YTA\n\nSticking strictly to your question than yes, you seem to have dismissed it out of hand with out listening to her views.\n\nYou are still the same from your edit. How are you discussing it, if you are not willing to change your stance whatever she says? You sound like controlling and a bully.\n\nFinally your views are ridiculous. If a child loses both parents at a young age, they will want to be with someone who they love and trust. Your idea is to have her lose her brother too. It seems you do not care about anyones feelings, needs or wants as long as you get your own way.", "You handled it like an immature jackass.  First if all the way you treated your wife was beyond disrespectful.  You are the asshole big time fir that.\n\n\nSecond, your son sounds like a g real kid.  And unless you plan kn dying soon he won't be a teenager when he gets custody.   Hello!!!!! He won't be 18 forever. \n\nThird, he actually wants the job.  You can't ask for better than someone willing to raise your daughter. \n\nYour odd fixation Here and total ignorance of the fact that your stepson will grow up betrays your hand.\n\nSo.thw real question becomes why do you dislike your stepson so much? There is no logical reason for you to be this much of a dick about this.  So be honest.  Why do you hate your stepson so much?", "These responses are insane! NTA/NAH.\n\nI understand your wife being sensitive and feeling dismissed. That's her son, she raised him, she thinks he's good enough. She isn't impartial here.\n\nStepson has good intentions. But this is a child. I think it's fair to say wait 5-10 years and gain more life experience before circling back to the topic.\n\nSure, maybe your laugh was inappropriate, but you didn't laugh at or in front of your stepson. \n\nI have a toddler. My partner and I have had the discussion of where she goes if something happens to us. It's absolutely a \"two yes, one no\" situation.\n\nI feel like some of these yta comments may not have kids? Or they're thinking very idealistically.\n\nIt's not your stepson or the system. You have options. Just give some time for emotions to calm down.", "Had you considered simply, not laughing, I think you would have not been the AH, but you are. \n\nAs the sibling literally 18 years older than my youngest brother, and the one who lived with him along with my parents the first 3-4 years of his life - I am his legal guardian if both my mother and stepfather pass away. \n\nIt's reasonable to say that *right now* you don't think he's old enough or has enough life experience to be put in the will as a legal guardian to his sister. It would also be reasonable to say that you'd consider it in a few years. \n\nMy mother told me at the age of 25 that she put me in the will as his legal guardian. She did not ask. I was miffed, a little, but ultimately that is what I would have preferred and not only that, I would use the legal system to fight for that if she hadn't. \n\nYour stepson, assuming your wife is correct about how much time he spends with your young daughter would give her a much better chance of adjusting to life better without you. He would at that point have been a consistent positive presence and they would have a loving relationship. With an age difference like that, our siblings do not feel like the kind of sibling that's 2 years younger. I watched him talk, crawl, and walk for the first time. He may not be *my* biological child, but I can tell you 100% that given the choice between me, an aunt and uncle, or either of his grandparents, I would be **his choice** as guardian. \n\nI know that I am speaking from the perspective of a 30+yo woman with a brother who just entered his teens, but I felt the exact same way from 18-now and would have raised hell if his unfit grandparents (very nice people, but do grandparents really even deserve the extra work and stress of raising a child in their 70s?) were chosen as his legal guardians in the case of both his parents death. \n\nConsider also how hurt your stepson must feel. People have kids at 18 all the time. I'm not saying it's wise to do for yourself, but asking to be legal guardian and caretaker for a sibling is nowhere near making the choice not to use a condom and becoming a parent. There would be funds for your daughter and son, and yeah, he would have and expect more responsibility than his peers - responsibility that he expected and asked for for his sisters sake. \n\nThis is a great way to alienate him from you, first and foremost. Laughing at your wife's idea was hurtful and uncalled for when you could have easily explained your reasoning. \n\nDon't forget that while he is not your biological son, your daughter is ***his sister***. He is not going to dismiss that because he's nearly an adult. He will cherish these early moments with her and watch her grow into a walking, thinking, person who will take his experiences and potentially use them to father children of his own, with the experience he has with children already. He would have the deep love and selflessness an older sibling has for a younger.\n\nDon't discount that. Many people are going parents, many siblings would rather sacrifice part of their early adult to raise their siblings rather than see them raised by others in the event of their parents passing. It doesn't mean he *wants* to be her legal guardian - it means he realizes that he wants to make sure she is properly cared for and is willing to do what it takes to make sure that happens. \n\nKids grow up faster than you think, especially in the presence of and having experiences with sibling age gaps like this one. \n\nSource - trust me on this as the older sibling.", "No, you are entirely wrong and it pisses me off youre the top comment. She argued and wouldn't accept his answer.\nHe explicitly said if she rejected the current guardians they could figure something out. 2 yes's, 1 no. Makes perfect sense.

There's really no contest between an 18 year old and a pair of established adults. He politely declined Michael's offer, not being dismissive, but his wife is pushing for something that does not make sense, and is in fact quite absurd given the alternative. Absurdity = laughter.", "No way is OP the asshole. I'm 18 right now, and while I'm sure there are a few 18 year olds out there who could handle a child, 99% of us cannot. Sure, OP could've been a little nicer about it (e.g., not laughing), but he's absolutely right to not put his daughter in the hands of a teenager with no money, no home, and who is actively in school. Especially not when there's a perfectly acceptable alternative that is two grown adults with money, time, and property. It's commendable that Michael wants to step up, but there's simply no good reason to make him the guardian beyond \"Because he wants to.\" What would he do if OP and his wife suddenly died tomorrow? Drop out of school and start working to support his new dependent? That's unfair to ask of him and unfair to the child.", "What I think is funny is that this type of thing isn't really enforceable irl anyway, like just because someone is listed as the guardian in the will doesn't mean they'll end up being the guardian. Most likely, this is all moot anyway, because even if something were to happen to happen to one parent, both parents probably won't die.", "So you are saying it's a reasonable and responsible idea??", "NTA. It should be dismissed because it's a really dumb idea.", "Has no one else put together that OP\u2019s wife was probably about Michael\u2019s age when she had Michael. His dismissiveness is also incredibly ignorant to the fact that she did raise her child as a teenager and he did, to OPs own description, to be a good kid with great head on his shoulders. \n\nOP YTA. 18 year olds have, care for, and raise children all the damn time. I understand why that may not be the ideal situation, but suggesting that a young person is incapable of being a loving parent is unfair to your wife who actually did it.", "I can't believe so many people are saying OP is the AH just because he wasn't very nice about this situation.aybe he shouldn't have laughed but what he's saying makes a lot of sense. \nNot only is an 18 to early 20's person usually not old enough or ready enough to take care of a child, regardless of how serious, mature or how much he loves his sister. On top of everything this (very hypothetical) situation would be very hard on the 18 y-o. On top of the loss of his mother and the paperwork he would have to sort out, it would be foolish when there are more mature, more stable adults available to properly take care of this child. \n\nCould OP have been kinder ? yes, maybe. is he the AH ? No. NAH", "I totally agree. I have an 18 year old sister. Of course 18 year olds can be mature.

As long as OP didn\u2019t laugh maliciously, I think NTA", "Because if stepdad is dismissive - the apples of the family tree seem as likely to be dismissive and that just hurts both kids. \n\nWhich is why the wife is starting to rethink this.  I know when we set up their dad's friends (couple with children the same age and plenty of room and resources) despite he and I having issues with one another (before my oldest wanted my youngest) we made sure that who we choose would be willing to allow both sides of the family to have some visitation - access because our like or dislike of each other is not a reason to F#$% our kids over in the event they lose us.  Death creates strong feelings.  They will have lost their mother and their father -or in your case step-father.  They need someone who will put them both first - meaning they will allow access.  \n\nOf course, now that my oldest wants my youngest and the man she plans on marrying is all on board with it, we are now changing it up.  Instead of the family friend taking her in - they will just support my oldest in raising my youngest.  Family bonds are vital to kids and to young adults.  Their relationship needs to be protected and nurtured.  Being dismissive is very hurtful and painful.", "he\u2019s right tho, Michael is a teen, he\u2019s not ready to raise a kid.

Does this differ by country?\n\nOn another note, you seem to be saying that there\u2019s something dehumanizing or objectifying about designating legal guardians for your children in the event of your death, which feels like a weird take to me. Isn\u2019t this something that lots of responsible parents do? Where do you get that designating a guardian is the same as \u201cwilling an object\u201d?\n\nWill\u2019s aren\u2019t just for distributing property - they\u2019re for expressing last wishes and wrapping up legal loose ends.\n\nFinally, parents of young children SHOULD take the possibility of their death \u201cliterally and overly seriously\u201d - this is the welfare of their children they\u2019re thinking about.

There's nothing about being her brother that magically gives him a good job an a stable place to live.

The Y T A judgements are baffling to me - it\u2019s not like he laughed at the idea to Michael when he brought it up, that would be an AH move. This was in a private conversation with his wife, who is suggesting something that OP (reasonably) considers ludicrous. Also, it\u2019s not as though OP has said \u2018absolutely never Michael\u2019, he (again, reasonably) suggested that they revisit the terms in 10 years or so when Michael is a more established adult. Could OP have been more tactful in this convo with his wife? Sure.

OP could easily have explained his reasoning further without laughing in her face.", "Lmfao no the immature ones here are the ones thinking an 18 year old student is a better fit for guardianship than an aunt and uncle who are already established adults. This isn\u2019t OP looking out for just the toddler, its him looking out for both kids. If the 18 becomes the guardian then what sacrifices does the 18 need to make to be able to do the bare minimum to care for her? Young adults already work fulltime and still struggle just to care for themselves. Meanwhile you have two adults already established in their career which gives the toddler a much more stable home and allows the son to continue his education and get a good career. Also volunteering to be guardian doesn\u2019t inherently make one responsible, plenty of teenagers overestimate their capabilities. Its honorable but illogical to use that as your justification to prove maturity.", "How is OP showing immaturity?", "It makes sense when you realize Reddit is also full of teenagers who think they\u2019re much more mature than they are.

He\u2019s 18 years old and considering that he would be grieving the loss of his mother and stepfather on top of the life altering decision to take on full custody of a minor child (who could quite possibly still be in diapers) on top of school its crazy to me that anyone would be arguing for him to be the guardian. \n\nI actually don\u2019t think OP was being dismissive to his wife\u2019s feelings at all. Why would you even consider an 18yr old when you have an established married couple that you both agreed on? Why would/should he have tip toed around this point to save feelings? I don\u2019t think his laughing was dismissive so much as an automatic reaction to thinking she must be joking are you for real. \n\nEven considering giving full custody of a baby to an 18yr old sounds like something you did to him as opposed to something you do for him (by allowing him to have a well rounded foundation to adulthood without the stress and worry that having a child brings).", "FACTs !!

It was a ridiculous idea, OP calmly reacted when it was brought up, he only chuckled when the wife kept pushing the idea.
