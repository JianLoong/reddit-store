She has a son, Michael who is 18. We get along pretty well. He's a good kid with a great head on his shoulders.\n\nThis past year, my wife and I welcomed our first biological child together, Sarah. We're going through the process of updating our wills, which means choosing guardians in the event that both of us died. When Michael was younger, Denise had her parents listed, but they're now older and in no condition to take care of a baby. We asked my sister and her husband, they agreed.\n\nWe were explaining some things to Michael that came along with the will (insurance goes to him if we both pass, what he'd inherit, etc). We also explained that there was an account set up for him to get his own apartment once he finished college (he's currently a freshman), should we both pass by then. (Unlikely, but all bases covered sort of thing)\n\nMichael then asked what would happen to Sarah. We told him our guardian choices. Michael straightened up and said that no, he would take on Sarah. I said that was very sweet, but he was still very young. Maybe we'd consider updating it in 10 or so years when he's older and more established. My wife said we'd think about it.\n\nIn private, I asked if she was seriously considering it. She pointed out that Michael spends a lot of time with her, is a good kid, etc and is volunteering. I said I wouldn't feel comfortable putting the fate of our daughter in the hands of a young adult. I said if Denise was changing her mind on my sister and brother-in-law, that was completely fine but to me, Michael is not an option and it should be a \"two yes, one no wins\" situation. She asked if it would really be so mad for Michael to become guardian and I laughed. While yes, Michael is volunteering, he has no real clue what would come with being a parent. As I said, in 10 years, when he's more established and an adult, I'd consider it. For now, it needs to be someone else.\n\nDenise isn't upset that I don't want Michael to be the guardian, but she is upset over how dismissive I'm being and that I laughed at her. She says that I'm being hurtful and offensive to both her and her son. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am not changing my mind on making him guardian.

For now, it needs to be someone else.\n\nCorrect.\n\nYTA though because:\n\n> how dismissive I'm being and that I laughed at her.", "YTA for laughing. She was being serious, she has valid reasons. I\u2019m not saying you should change your mind, but you shouldn\u2019t be so dismissive. Also, since it\u2019s your side of the family taking Sarah, are you willing to put visit provisions in the will so Micheal won\u2019t lose touch? You may not think it\u2019s likely, but Michael could be worried about something like that.", "Yes, YTA for your approach. \n\n18yos adopt their younger sibs all the time. Just because Michael isn't ready today doesn't make him a joke. That's his sister and he doesn't want to be separated from her if something happens to you. That's noble and thoughtful, and dare I say it - mature. \n\nYou should have handled his inquiry with much more empathy and kindness.", "YTA\n\nYou're not only being condescending and dismissive, you've also just told your wife \"I don't think you've raised someone capable of looking after his sister and I'd rather break up our blended family unit than give him the chance to try\"\n\nNot thrusting the responsibility for a child upon him is one thing, but if he's responsible enough to ask, you should at least do him the courtesy of discussing it. Your sister and her husband could always take over or help out if it *does* become too much for him.", "YTA - How would you not be the asshole for laughing at your wife? You implied that you think that Michael is so irresponsible and can\u2019t be trusted to look after his sister. Why wouldn\u2019t she be offended when she thinks that you don\u2019t trust her son?", "YTA, either you're reasonably old parents of a newborn or your wife was a reasonably young mom. By implying her son would be incapable of being a good Guardian I imagine your wife is feeling like your invalidating her experience of motherhood and implying she was a bad parent.", "YTA. I think you\u2019re making the right choice concerning guardians, but the way you reacted was rude and dismissive. \n\nYour step-son is clearly concerned about the possibility of his sister being taken away from him, and deserves the respect of a serious conversation about the pros and cons for both your children if he was the guardian (financial security, his education and ability to establish his career, etc). You can also work to figure out conditions that would help him to feel more secure (ex. Guaranteed visitation, holidays)", "YTA. You\u2019re not completely wrong to be concerned with the idea and even veto it, but laughing and being dismissive was completely uncalled for. He sounds like a wonderful person and you should be very grateful that your child has an older brother who is responsible and loving to volunteer for that responsibility, even at 18. So stop being an asshole to your wife about it.", "YTA - not for questioning if your stepson understands  fully what responsibilities come with raising children. As an informed adult and parent, I get where you are coming from.\n\nHowever, the way you dismissed your wife is appalling. You laughed at her when she brought up the possibility that her son, who\u2019s 18, offered to take his own sister. She raised that boy and he wants to put his life on the line for his sister in the case where you both pass away. I don\u2019t know many young adults who would do that. She\u2019s taught him to value his family and if that was my kid I would seriously think about it too. \n\nShe did good with him, and you just laughed at her.", "YTA both for your attitude, laughing at your wife, and arguing with people here who disagree with you. Guess what? Lots of us think you're an AH!", "YTA for laughing and being dismissive. I understand why you might not want Michael to be the guardian but your reaction wasn\u2019t cool. On the bright side, you have a lot of people, including Michael, who love your daughter so much they would be willing to take care of her if anything ever happened. Don\u2019t just be dismissive of that.", "YTA. Nothing makes me more upset than when I'm discussing a serious thing with my partner and he has the audacity to laugh. There was no need to do that. I think you're right that's a two yeses situation, but there's nothing wrong with her talking up her son. She's obviously proud of him, he's obviously a good kid, and it's okay for you to be opposed to him being your younger child's guardian should the worst happen, but don't laugh at someone in a serious conversation. Rude. Since you can't come up with it on your own and it would have been perfect to deflect the situation, \"I think it's so sweet he loves and cares for his baby half sister but I can't imagine saddling him with the responsibility of raising someone else's child at such a young age, even in this unlikely scenario.\" It takes the spin from \"lol you're just a young ignorant kid,\" to \"I want to be sure you have the opportunity to live and enjoy your younger years without that added responsibility.\"", "Look, you need to realize that a child isn't an object you can will to someone. No matter who you say you want to have the kids, that's just a factor for consideration of who gets custody, not the end of the line. Other factors include \"who wants custody\", and \"who's guardianship would be least disruptive to the child's current life\", and \"whose custody is generally best for the child emotionally and physically,\" and \"who the child prefers to be with\" (when the child is old enough) ect ect.\n\nYour \"this is who I want my child to be with\" is a factor, and it's your final decision you really get to offer your opinion on for your child, but you seem to be taking this possibility overly literally and overly seriously? No matter what you say, Michael may or may not end up with the child if you died tomorrow.", "Since you\u2019re only asking for a judgment on your reaction, YTA.  You WERE being dismissive and condescending.  You could\u2019ve communicated the same opinion in a mature, thoughtful way.", "YTA. So much. Do you have any idea what a gift this boy has given you with this?  He wants his half sister and wants to care for her. Extraordinary.\n\nYoung adult children take on guardianship of younger siblings every day and have for as long as we have had the concept of family. Why not make him the guardian with your sibling as a co-guardian so they make the decisions as a family for his sister? Why not both? In ten years your sister may not even want the responsibility. Or your son may not. It would not hurt a thing to speak to your attorney and work this out so he is part of her life if you both die.", "YTA for laughing. Totally get not having your stepson be a guardian in his early 20s but laughing was wrong. It's not unreasonable at all to revisit the plan in the future (my wife and I do that every few years cause things in life change).", "YTA", "YTA for laughing, yes.", "A bit of an AH for laughing but not AH for  your reasoning as to the guardianship , you're right in that.", "YTA\n\nPeople become parents at 18 and cope fine. From your post there are not any known pressing health conditions that make the two of you more likely to have issues looking after your daughter. As he gets older so will she and if he is around her often assisting in looking after her then if the worst happens it will be an easier transition for her.", "YTA.\n\nYou clearly mean well, but all your wife and stepson will get from this is that you don't trust him.", "YTA, you should be ecstatic that your daughters brother wants to be her guardian if shit hits the fan. having the next closest person to her stay with her is best case scenario if something happens to you two.", " YTA other than Michael being young do you really have a good reason for not considering him?", "NTA - he's too young since you have other options. What if something happened to the two of you in the next year. Would your wife expect Michael to drop out of school and abandon his future plans for his life in order to care for an infant?\n\nCan there be something that gives him more of a ceremonial role in her life - like a god parent or something similar, while leaving the burden of child rearing to your sister and husband? \n\nalthough minor YTA if you were indeed dismissive which caused the hurt feelings. Explain you are thinking as much for Michael's well being as you are your daughter.", "NTA. I hope the situation is purely a hypothetical one, but I imagine the reality is that him being her guardian at 18 would seriously affect his life more so than it would your sisters. Maybe you came across as dismissive for laughing, if so hold your hands up to that. But your wife must realise the sacrifices involved in raising a child - money, home, schools, transport - that her son would need to make are a lot to impose on any 18 year old.", "YTA completely for how you handled it. You are condescending and come off as a know it all AH. You have a son and a brother who shows great maturity in wanting to step up and be there for his sister. Is that wise when there are other options? No but for you to laugh and just dismiss his gesture and what he is willing to sacrifice to be there for his sister is just fucked up. He was willing to give up the rest of his youth and sacrifice and you just laugh. So yeah do not make him the guardian but the way you handled it makes him the mature one at 18 and you an AH and a child for the way you dismiss him.", "YTA not for your choice in guardian because you guys know Michael and his abilities best but you were incredibly rude and dismissive of your wife regarding this.", "YTA for laughing also YTA for not considering him if this world and the internet has taught us anything it\u2019s that even the most stable looking people can be in a bad situation in private. 10 years or now he should still be an option already because older guardians will just get older just like the parents did and you had to update. If you\u2019re really planning for your after death situation then you need plan A, B, and C for that baby he should be an option because that\u2019s her brother. If you\u2019re planning this guardianship all on what ifs, what if you, your wife and your sister and your BIL all die together? What happens to baby girl then?", "NTA you\u2019re all valid and mean well. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like ya crushed his soul but were reasonable by saying you\u2019d reconsider in the future. \n\nI am biased tho cause I believe giving a young adult a baby could be detrimental to the future of both lives. But that\u2019s just my opinion and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s many instances where I\u2019m wrong", "NTA\n\nIt IS sweet, but taking on the responsibility of a toddler while he is a college student is not what is best for either of them!  Why would she want that for Michael?  (I know someone who gained custody of her then 11-yo sister at 21, dropped out out of college to raise her, and this girl JUST finished high school - and she was 11, not a baby!)\n\nI think you have the right idea.  It's a heavy thing to have to think about (and some people go to very dark places just considering their own deaths), so maybe cut Denise some slack for getting emotions wrapped up in it.", "Gonna be the lone voice saying NAH here I guess. I would feel the same as you. I\u2019d laugh if someone suggested my 18 year old step son suddenly become a parent full time to a grieving child. That\u2019s not fair to either your step son or your child and it\u2019s not realistic for your step son to think it\u2019s a good idea either.", "NTA, you should absolutely be dismissive of this mother even forbsla second seriously contemplating her son giving up his life to care for a child when a perfectly acceptable alternative is available.  There are many who going to an older sibling is the only option and they step up which is great but this always comes with great sacrifice. Why would she want that for her son? I couldn't imagine doing that to my child when I have established family members who can care for my children. Anyone advocating for you to give him a chance is out of thier minds. Hopefully nine of this ever comes to pass but let that young man live his life, he can still be a part of his sisters life without blowing up his own.", "NTA he's 18!? Are the people in the comments on crack or something. The wife wasn't being objective. Obviously an established couple is a better bet than an 18 y old kid.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI can see why people don\u2019t like that you laughed. I think it\u2019s a little funny that your wife thought if she asked the same question again, she would get a different answer. I\u2019m assuming this was a small, involuntary chuckle, right? \n\nAnyway, good job updating wills and discussing difficult topics as a family!", "ESH. \n\nYTA for laughing, you should sit down and apologise for that. Also explain that you\u2019re not comfortable until he\u2019s older. Your point about it being two yes\u2019s is good, that\u2019s how it should be.\n\nI said ESH because I understand your point. He clearly absolutely loves his sister, but he\u2019s only 18 and doesn\u2019t actually know the responsibility he\u2019ll have if it comes down to it. Updating it in 5-10 years is a good idea.", "NAH just some wrong people. \n\nWhile it's understandable why you don't want him to be the one taking care of his sister at 18 (,and I definitely like you for that as I spent the majority of my young teen and later teen years taking care of many siblings because apparently my mom and my step father doesn't know what a condom is and that leaving a 12(Me) and 10(my little sister) year old girls to take care of 3 toddlers and 1 infant and leaving the managing of the house to a 12(me) year old while they work is not the smartest of choices), you shouldn't have laughed.\n\nYou wife has the right to be upset, and you should apologize, and should also consider how wonderful it is that your step-son was willing to take care of his sister in the event that you may pass. I'd love to switch places with him. He can happily have my life. \n\nSo again, NAH.", "NTA. He sounds like a lovely young man. But you have established adults who have agreed to become guardians if something happens to you and your wife. Even the BEST 18 year old is not equipped for solo parenthood. This is not a judgement on your wife\u2019s parenting, it\u2019s just facts.", "INFO: how old was your wife when she had her son? I\u2019m guessing she was quite young if 18 years later she\u2019s got an infant. You said he\u2019s a good kid with a good head on his shoulders - thanks to being raised by your wife who would\u2019ve been a young adult. \n\nWhy is his age an issue if he\u2019s volunteering to do it? \n\nI want to lean NAH because it should be a two yes situation, but I\u2019m really curious about why you\u2019re so against it. And I do think YTA for laughing and dismissing this so easily. You see so many stories about parents wishing half siblings would accept each other and here he is, offering to take full responsibility for his little sister and you\u2019re denying him that.", "YTA since you probably could found a way to express yourself without flat out belittling your wife.\n\nI think the bigger question here is if YOU know how to be a parent.  What you wrote above makes you sound less mature than Michael.", "Michael sounds great tbh. You however.............yta", "YTA Not choosing him isn\u2019t what makes you the AH automatically dismissing him derisively does.  18 is an adult and they raise kids all the time, nobody has a clue what being a parent is like until they are one.", "Yta. He loves that baby and he would go out of his way to do his best for her.  You are dismissive and you act like he isn't capable.\nChances are he would be much better with her than your sister.", "NTA because Michael is really just barely an adult. Does he want to go to college? Have a normal dating life? Stay out late and party with friends? If in theory you and your wife died tomorrow- his life would completely change. I think the way you approached it wasn\u2019t the best, and maybe sit down with him and your wife again and explain this is in the best interest of both Sarah and Michael. He\u2019ll still have access to her and be her brother, and he\u2019ll still get to pursue his dreams without the pressure of providing for and raising a young child. Maybe tell him you appreciate how much he loves his sister and you\u2019re so happy he\u2019s willing to raise her if anything happens, but that he\u2019s young and deserves the chance to make his own life without extra pressure. Maybe once he finishes college or gets a stable job you will definitely revisit the will if he still wants to be her guardian", "Why is OP TA for not wanting to saddle his stepson with taking care of someone else\u2019s child? If he wanted to do this y\u2019all would be UP IN ARMS about how it\u2019s not this kid\u2019s responsibility, he shouldn\u2019t have to raise his siblings, etc. NTA OP. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have laughed but I agree, he\u2019s too young and putting that kind of responsibility on someone (doesn\u2019t matter if they volunteered or not) is not okay.", "NTA - No dates for him, no social life, he'd have to get a job. That fact that he offered that way shows he has no idea. LOL, no. I'd laugh too.", "Nta it sounds like you have no faith in your stepson and think he is totally incapable of rising to the occasion of raising his half sister.

Also, of course he doesn\u2019t know how to raise a child\u2026.. but a large number of 18 year olds are parents.", "Neither does you. It is your first kid. Your wife is the one who knows how to raise a child since he raised one already. Sorry she couldnt find a new husband that wasnt a major AH", "I didn\u2019t say first choice I said A choice", "I can make the choice of how I create my will. I understand that wills can be contested but I also spoke with a lawyer. While yes, Michael is family, so is my sister. They have more resources and proof that they can raise her more. \n\nSure, there\u2019s a chance he could get custody in spite of our will. But it\u2019s very rare.", "I\u2019m not making him co-Guardian. Please keep judgment for the question at hand.", "And that\u2019s fine and a choice that they make. I have the right to say I don\u2019t want my child being raised by a teenager.", "I feel crazy reading some of these replies. Yeah, he shouldn't have laughed at his wife, but the idea that giving some 18-year-old a child to raise is NBD is fucking ridiculous. Especially when there is an established, financially stable stable, married aunt and uncle who have experience raising a child.", "I assume this lawyer is a wills and estates lawyer. I work in family law. It is not as rare as he seems to think. It would be a family law issue and not in his practice area at all. He likely means people rarely contest, not that they rarely win. Cause that is not true - over turning a guardianship goes to family court not probate. And people fight guardianships all the time.", "Custody isn't about \"contesting a will\" because *children cannot be willed*. They *are not a possession*. The system decide who is the best option for the child out of the people willing to do so, not fully ignoring what you've expressed, but independent of what you've expressed in your will.\n\nIf Michael wants it, he will ask for it, and as her closest relation by blood, if she's old enough that they have a close sibling bond and a physical closeness of residence to where her life is... he'd probably win? Maybe not tomorrow if you died as an eighteen year old asking for an infant, but in five years when he's graduated college and she's five or so and is emotionally close to him, I think it'd be pretty certain? With a will that was made when he was only 18? Especially if, as I suspect would be the case, your sister isn't aware that Michael would want to take care of his sister before he put his name in the hat-- lots of people would go, \"Oh, if (closer relation) wants to take care of this child, then of course *they* should do so!\" and step back themselves.\n\nFor the record, YTA for LAUGHING at her serious consideration, it doesn't sound like you discussed this respectfully. And laughing that early on in the conversation makes it difficult to step anywhere forward in the conversation without your initial rude dismissal colouring everyone else's responses.", "Please do not post on a public forum then attempt to dictate how people respond. \n\nYTA for how you have treated your wife and your son and your closed mind.", "I know. He is an awesome kid! There\u2019s still no reason for an 18 year old to be the primary guardian of a child when there are established adults in the family available.", "I assumed that by listing what I asked to be judged on, it\u2019d be kept to that.", "Stop forcing your advice onto OP, he doesn\u2019t want it.", " People go off on all sorts of tangents and make up all sorts of scenarios in this sub. On topic is not really a thing. \n\nI do hope you recognize how lucky you are to have a stepson who loves the baby and wants to be there for her. I wonder if he is worried he might lose her if she goes to your sister.", "He posted on an advice sub.", "This is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. The rules specifically say not to post asking for advice, which he didn\u2019t do. \n\nThe guy said he doesn\u2019t want your advice. No means no. Leave it at that", "No, you are right on that. Sorry. I just find him to be a bit pompous and am overreacting", "It\u2019s all good, everyone gets carried away sometimes"]}
