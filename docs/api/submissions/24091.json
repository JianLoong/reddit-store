I'm sobbing at all the **baby clothes** I'm about to lose **that I planned on wearing.**\n\nI'm saying: What about other things, like those that carry sentimental value to you?", "Plenty of parents don\u2019t mind storing their kids things.  And when it becomes an issue and they want the things removed or they want to do something else with them  - they ask the kids!", "We do however know that he didn\u2019t bother to ask his kids and he didn\u2019t care what they thought. He gave the stuff to his young daughter and just ignored his old Family\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s very obvious he could care less about their feelings Lillys gonna get what he wants Lily to have. Why wouldn\u2019t he just buy new toys for Lily?", "Because they were their toys. He should\u2019ve at least asked hey I found this stuff in the attic or wherever are you interested in coming and getting it or can I give it to Lily. They wanted those items for their future children. Children this age mark things up throw things and leave them outside who knows what can happen. Is he gonna watch to make sure she doesn\u2019t destroy these items?\n\nLike I said before I kept a lot of things from my kids childhood and I called them and asked them if they wanted them and they were thrilled to get them back we spent the whole day going over memories of each item and it was a wonderful day for all of us. They won\u2019t have that. I think it\u2019s because he wanted to hurt his old family but that\u2019s just my opinion nothing based on fact", "\u201cPlenty of parents don\u2019t mind storing their kids things\u201d\n\nNothing in my comment goes against this. What I said was that I either took the things I wanted OR communicated with my parents about what things I cared about that was stored at their house. Why does the communication aspect of this 100% fall on OP and not his fully grown adult children?", "Because he\u2019s the one changing the status quo? Like it would be weird to have to say - \u201cremember the things you\u2019re storing for me? I still care about those.\u201d  How often do they need to say that? Is it an annual reaffirmation? \n\nI think the kids assumed that things were fine as is.", "YTA - But you arenlt vindctive, you just f\u2019d up.

Creepy", "Gentle YTA.\n\nYou should have checked in with your daughters if they wanted them first. I have a small collection of toys that my parents are saving for me when I have children and I would be incredibly upset if they were given away", "Soft YTA - I say soft because it wasn't your intention to hurt your older children.  But you do owe them an apology - acquiesce to your thoughtlessness and imperfection as a human in the process of apologizing too.", "So what stood out to me here was this \n\n> I just wanted to see lily happy, and it didn\u2019t cross my mind that there might be any issues with giving her the toys\n\nBecause how I would view that sentence had you said it to your daughters was \n\n> I just wanted to see lily happy, and my older daughters didn\u2019t even cross my mind. \n\nNow, as a painfully sentimental person with a painfully unsentimental father I can kind of understand your position, because my dad has never really gotten the idea that old things can hold strong sentimental value. But as the painfully sentimental person it would have crushed me had he not even considered asking me if I wanted something from *my* childhood before giving it to someone else. I am also sure there are a lot of other dynamics at play given that you have a daughter two decades younger than your daughters with your new wife that likely cause friction in this relationship too, meaning you need to tread even more carefully", "NTAH. If the older kids had future plans for the old stuff, they should have related that information to dad. \n\nConsidering the stuff had been up there for years apparently, dad was not in the wrong for giving them to younger daughter. \n\nHow was he supposed to know if the stuff was just collecting dust.", "Yes you should have asked your daughters for permission before you gave their things away.  You meant well, but yes YTAH here.  I'd buy Lily all new toys of the same type if you can and give the others back to your adult daughters.  Good luck...", "YTA!!! You need to make this right!", "Yta", "EAH if your daughters wanted the toys,  they would've taken them at some point already.

You have replaced them with your new family", "I know it was well intended, but you should've checked with  Sarah first.", "NTA, you've been keeping them in storage for a significant period of time in your own space. As far as I'm concerned, you are the effective owner of the toys. I think the other Redditors talking about how this will build resentment are out of their goddamn minds.\n\nIf your older daughters or these Redditors would hold resentment over toys, which have been in storage for around 2 decades being put to good use for a child who appreciates them, I spare no level of sympathy towards these people having such a pathetically small mole hill to die on.\n\nLily using the toys now does not take away Jane and Sarah's future children from being able to play with the toys and I think it's a rather silly presumption to assume that Lily using them now means they can never be used again. \n\nToy Library's exist specifically so toy's can do what they do best, being in the hands of the playful individuals who will use them instead of taking up space in storage. There's no reason why toys can't have an extensive history of exchanging hands, it's not like the toys are going anywhere after Lily is done with them, you can just put them back in storage or give them to your older daughters as soon as she is finished with them.", "NAH, just give the toys back to your older daughters when Lily gets tired of them.  They can still use them when they have children.", "Are you sure you\u2019re talking about your adult children? If someone gets upset someone else is playing with a toy they weren\u2019t using, that\u2019s a very childish reaction. Maybe it\u2019s time to sit all your kids down and explain the concept of sharing.", "YTA majorly", "ESH - Sounds like from the comments, the older daughters don't like the new wife because she's in close age proximity to them.  Which of course is understandable.  At the same time, I may be in the minority, but I don't feel like your childhood toys (especially for a 3 year old) are really \"your stuff\" I mean, technically they are, but did the daughters actually even know about the toys in the attic?  I know my parents forced me to take my childhood stuff, I didn't come looking for it.  You take it with you when you move out if its that important and the girls are above average college graduate age.  \n\nReally sounds like your daughters have the \"ick\" about them being contemporaries with your current wife and are making up a reason to be upset with your youngest. \n\nOn the other hand, you could have at least asked, even if they didn't know they were still up here.\n\nI went with ESH, but I really didn't want to give a judgement.  You have the right to remarry younger and have been married 6 years and have a 3 year old.  It clearly wasn't some post divorce fling.  Your daughters have the right to feel the ick that their dad is with someone their age.  I think what you all need more than a judgement is some family counseling.", "YTA big time.\n\nMy sister recently got all her childhood toys from my grandma\u2019s and gave them to my niece. Seeing her face light up as she saw the toys from pictures my sis had as a kid made me drive over to grandma\u2019s to grab my toys so I can give it to my kids one day as well.", "Sadly YTA. This could have been so simple. \"Hey daughters, I found this stuff in the attic. I know its yours, would like to have it or can I give it to Lily?\"", "YTA. You chose to start a new family. Jane and Sarah did not choose to start a new family, no matter how happy they are for you. \n\nYou prioritizing the new family over the old family makes sense from your perspective because you've started a new family. They have not changed their priorities.", "NTA these toys were doing nothing but gathering dust and now they are bringing joy to a child. Had your daughters truly wanted them they would be in their homes not yours. it will only be for a few years and then lilly will be too old for them too and they can go to grandchildren.", "I think your ages are off or else you had kids at 15...", "Your not an asshole but you should have asked before giving her the toys.", "This is the most important question for me too.", "Well I've been with my current wife for 6 years now, I met her shortly after my divorce from their mother and they weren't very fond of how fast I moved on from the divorce. She's also around their age and I know that made them a bit uncomfortable. They've always been pretty hostile towards my wife and have never gave her a chance to prove she's actually a really good person.", "Yeah.  I'm not buying it either.", "This is key", "Well, math says he was 15 for the first kid so smart thinking isn't OP's strong suit", "Wasn't lead on toys outlawed in the 70s?", "So she was barely 21 when you got together? So you married someone who could be your daughter, had a child with her and then gave that child all your adult children\u2019s toys? \n\nYTA", "And then got with a teenager when he got divorced from their mom.", "The replacement would be for Lily. :)\n\nI don't get the sense he intended to hurt his adult daughters.   But sure, think the worse of people who don't anticipate every reaction to their choices -- which would be most of us.", "3 year olds can also be taught to not destroy their toys.", "Of course interests change that's not what I'm saying. These adults are saying rather they'd rather these toys stay in the attic and collect dust and possibly be damaged than let their little sister play with them (of course if she had a history of breaking toys this is a no go). They can still pass on these toys to their children when they have children? So what's the issue? \n\nSuper sentimental toys (like if they had a favourite stuffed toy from childhood) would've stayed out of the attic and with them. I know people in uni who still have their sentimental childhood toys.\n\nIt's weird to me that these grown adults are getting pressed about toys they probably didn't even know were up there. If it's that big of an issue then they could take them back.", "Some people keep a super sentimental toy with them. Some put it away because people are assholes and make fun of them for having toys around, or because the risk of losing them is too great.\n\nEveryone is also jumping to the conclusion that the daughters didn\u2019t remember that the toys existed. Based on what?\n\nI know very well that my childhood American Girl dolls are somewhere in my parents\u2019 basement. I have not taken them out of my parents\u2019 basement because I live in a one bedroom apartment because rent is insane; meanwhile, my parents have a house with adequate storage space and don\u2019t intend to move out yet. If they ever ask me to remove my stuff, I will.\n\nMy parents are very generous and have given a lot of our stuff away to second cousins or neighbors but they ALWAYS ask first. And I usually say yes. But they also know that certain specific items like those dolls are important to me and that I will make the choice if I want to sell them, keep them, pass them down to my niece, or whatever.", "Yes? That\u2019s not uncommon.\nIt\u2019s not like Lily is a deprived child that has no other toys.  \n\nMy husband and I both have toys that we saved that our kids than used (mostly legos and American girl and a few of my favorite Barbie\u2019s) and our kids have things already in our attic that they want to save", "Yes.", "It's not like he gave them to someone who didn't even live there tho. The toys will still be in the same house just instead of being in an attic they'll actually be used. The daughters now have a chance to take them back or ask the dad to put them back in the attic so no harm done.", "But he didn\u2019t get rid of them. Their little sister is playing with them. They can easily get them back once she outgrows them. So basically, their father isn\u2019t allowed to give their little sister hand-me-downs?\n\nY\u2019all are reaching. This a power trip from the older sisters in protest on their father\u2019s new family.\n\nIf they held such sentiment, why didn\u2019t they have them to begin with? Sounds like they were with their father in his attic.", "And if you have additional children, you\u2019re going to spend MORE money to buy the same toys for your new child(ren)?", "Y\u2019all petty & so are the sisters lol.", "Because he didn\u2019t even ask. He didn\u2019t care about their feelings. And who knows if they\u2019ll be anything left of those toys when this kid and the other kids that he\u2019s gonna have ate done with them. I guess I\u2019m the only sentimental one. I kept all the special toys for 30 years and when I was cleaning out I called them to ask if they wanted this stuff and every single one of them said yes. They were fond memories with those things. Of course those memories are gone now in place of his new family which seems to be more important to him. Why didn\u2019t he just buy his new family new toys? Make new memories with a new family. But again he doesn\u2019t care", "These kids are a generation apart so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re buying the same toys.  \n\nBut yes, even with kids just a few years apart all my kids have some items that were more special to them that they didn\u2019t share with their siblings.", "Okay.", "I think there\u2019s a difference between sharing random clothes and toys (which maybe did happen) and sharing the absolute favorite treasured items.\n\nLike was this bins and bins of every toy they ever had? Or was it a few things each that were their absolute favorites?", "I am 32 years old. Anything that I want to \u201ckeep\u201d or is sentimental to me, I took from my parents home. My mom is \u201csentimental\u201d as well and has a bunch of junk sitting in my childhood home that will very likely sit, collect dust, and then be sold in an estate sale when she and my dad are no longer with us. I\u2019m being practical and realistic, if the daughters wanted the stuff, they would have gotten it. What if the house has burn down? We\u2019re they going to be mad at their dad for not keeping it in a safe space?", "That\u2019s a good question, and without any responses from OP I wouldn\u2019t want to make assumptions. If the toys were his kids most treasured toys then OP would be the AH for this (as well as not paying enough attention to his kids to know which of their toys are most important to them), but if they were just some random toys from their childhood that they are only wanting now that OP has let the new kiddo play with them then OP is NTA. \n\nI\u2019m at the point of not wanting to make a judgement on the situation but willing to call OP the AH for the complete lack of response", "He should have asked. He put them away when they were young so it did mean something."]}
