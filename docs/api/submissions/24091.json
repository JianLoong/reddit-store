Now he is keeping some of those things for my granddaughter.", "Maybe toys don't have sentimental value for YOU but you can't speak for others.", "You sound like one of these OPs who throw away their SO's beloved childhood plushies then wonder why they're upset (a recurring theme on AITA). They are uniformly found to be assholes.", "I'm not making any equivalence, and I'm not comparing toys to pictures. \n\nCommenter says: So everything you have at home and you did not use last decades, can we take them without your consent ?\n\nReply: Yeah, go for it. I'm sobbing at all the **baby clothes** I'm about to lose **that I planned on wearing.**\n\nI'm saying: What about other things, like those that carry sentimental value to you?", "Plenty of parents don\u2019t mind storing their kids things.  And when it becomes an issue and they want the things removed or they want to do something else with them  - they ask the kids!", "We do however know that he didn\u2019t bother to ask his kids and he didn\u2019t care what they thought. He gave the stuff to his young daughter and just ignored his old Family\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s very obvious he could care less about their feelings Lillys gonna get what he wants Lily to have. Why wouldn\u2019t he just buy new toys for Lily?", "Because they were their toys. He should\u2019ve at least asked hey I found this stuff in the attic or wherever are you interested in coming and getting it or can I give it to Lily. They wanted those items for their future children. Children this age mark things up throw things and leave them outside who knows what can happen. Is he gonna watch to make sure she doesn\u2019t destroy these items?\n\nLike I said before I kept a lot of things from my kids childhood and I called them and asked them if they wanted them and they were thrilled to get them back we spent the whole day going over memories of each item and it was a wonderful day for all of us. They won\u2019t have that. I think it\u2019s because he wanted to hurt his old family but that\u2019s just my opinion nothing based on fact", "\u201cPlenty of parents don\u2019t mind storing their kids things\u201d\n\nNothing in my comment goes against this. What I said was that I either took the things I wanted OR communicated with my parents about what things I cared about that was stored at their house. Why does the communication aspect of this 100% fall on OP and not his fully grown adult children?", "Because he\u2019s the one changing the status quo? Like it would be weird to have to say - \u201cremember the things you\u2019re storing for me? I still care about those.\u201d  How often do they need to say that? Is it an annual reaffirmation? \n\nI think the kids assumed that things were fine as is."]}
