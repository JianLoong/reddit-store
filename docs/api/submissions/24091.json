Recently, I got married again to an amazing woman, and together we have a sweet little daughter named Lily (3).\n\nHere's what happened: While cleaning out the attic, I stumbled upon some old toys that belonged to Jane and Sarah from their childhood. These toys were just gathering dust, and I thought it would be a great idea to give them to Lily. She absolutely adores her older sisters, and I thought the toys would bring her so much joy.\n\nHowever, things didn't go as expected. When I gave Lily the toys, Jane and Sarah got upset and hurt. They felt that these toys held sentimental value and had been expecting to keep them for their future children. I honestly didn't mean to hurt their feelings, and I had no idea these toys were so special to them. I just wanted to see Lily happy, and it didn't cross my mind that there might be any issues with giving her the toys.\n\nSo now, I'm wondering if I messed up and if I'm in the wrong here. Should I have checked with my adult daughters before giving the toys to Lily? I really want to maintain a strong relationship with all my kids, but I'm not sure if I crossed a line.\n\nEdit 1: To those saying I had a kid at 15, back in my town a lot of people had kids very young and by mistake.

If they take them now they're taking toys from a baby. If they have kids and want the toys, it's not their toy anymore, it's Lily's. If they take them when Lily is older will Lily understand that they *aren't* hers or will she be upset that her beloved childhood memories are being given to Sarah and Jane's kids to ruin, the way you've given it to Lily to ruin.\n\nAll you had to do was call them *before* you gave their toys away.

Your youngest won't have formed a deep emotional attachment to the toys yet and it is simply not worth impacting your relationships with your adult daughters. Without any intention, you've just told them that their childhood doesn't have any sentimental meaning to you. Why should they later visit with grandchildren? I'm pretty sure that is not what you really feel. So, please OP exchange the toys and talk with your adult daughters about the situation and apologize.  I also recommend that you three go all in the attic  together and sort the old stuff out (keeping, give away, and trash). If your adult daughters can't store the things themselves, there is at least clarity what belongs to whom.

Did you save those toys from your kids childhood or did they pack them up themselves?\n\n\nNTA unless they are something that holds more than sentimental value (like old Pok\u00e9mon cards that could be worth real money), then there is no reason that when your older daughters have kids that you can\u2019t give their old toys to them.

That said, clearly your daughters are feeling sentimental over seeing their old things with your baby and despite the big age difference they are feeling some sibling jealousy instead of feeling honored or happy to pass down their old toys to baby sis (probably because they had no say in it and feel blindsided).
