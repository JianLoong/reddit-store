I will call her Ava. The previous Sunday (10/29) she asked if we could get the Crunchyroll Streaming Service (yes, apparently this is a real thing) so that she could watch the finale of it live when it aired. Initially, I said no but she kept asking. She didn\u2019t drop the issue & explained it was the show\u2019s finale, it was the biggest show on television, all her (INTERNET) friends were watching, etc.  \n\n\n  \nOn Monday Ava continued to text nonstop about Crunchyroll (she lives with my ex-wife during the week), & I eventually agreed to subscribe for a month if she got above 90% on the AP Biology exam she had on Tuesday.  \n\n\n  \nFriday rolled around, & she texted that she got an A on her exam & asked for Crunchyroll. When I checked Powerschool myself I saw she got 81%. I texted her this to which she responded that the 81% would be \u201ccurved\u201d to 90%, which is clearly BS. Ava arrived at my house Saturday morning & immediately asked for Crunchyroll, I told her NO, & she got upset. She said this was a special occasion and important to her, etc. When my answer remained no, she started crying (which I find a bit ridiculous over a show) & locked herself in her bedroom.  \n\n\n  \nAt dinnertime I knocked on her door she didn\u2019t answer. I threatened to unlock the door, no answer, so I did, & she wasn\u2019t in the room. I don\u2019t know when, but at some point, she left my house. I immediately called my ex-wife, who hadn\u2019t seen her, & we flipped out. Ava hid her location on Find My iPhone. We called the parents of her friends, no dice. My ex-wife & I then each called our neighbors, which is how we discovered Ava was at a house down the street from mine of two boys she babysat. We learned their family had a Crunchyroll subscription & Ava had texted asking if she could watch & they said yes.  \n\n\n  \nIt was mortifying to pick her up & explain to this family that Ava had left without permission. They were watching The Attack On Titan when we arrived. I wanted her to return home immediately, but the couple explained the show was, in fact, quite popular & ended that night. They were actually watching with Ava & seemed sympathetic. I wasn\u2019t in any hurry to seem like a bad person in front of this family, so I agreed to let her stay as long as she came back home right after.  \n\n\n  \nShe did as I instructed, & tried to evade punishment by saying how happy she was to have watched the show. Still, I grounded her & took away her phone for the weekend, the latter of which made her upset again because apparently NOW she had to go online & discuss the show with her (INTERNET) friends & look at \u201cmemes\u201d about it. When I didn\u2019t relent, she said she\u2019d refuse to stay at my house for the rest of the year. I still took her phone, & she\u2019s ignored me all day.  \n\n\n  \nI feel the punishment is justified\u2013she lied & ran away & hid her location! But she finds it incredibly unfair, & the neighbors seem to agree that The Attack On Titan's finale was important.

You come off as way too controlling. She\u2019s 17 yo\u2026.why are you treating her like she\u2019s 10? She only starts lying and running away after you denied her a very simple request without providing any legit reason of why you do so. Why does she have to get good grade to be allowed to have a little harmless fun? She also got 80% on the test, which is not bad at all. The subscription for a month isn\u2019t even that expensive, it\u2019s like maybe 20 dollars? I need more info tho, why does she ask you to make the Crunchyroll subscription? Does she not have any money to make one herself?", "81% isn\u2019t good enough to let your kid watch a show? She definitely went too far but can\u2019t say that I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing at that age. in the future cut the kid a break maybe?

It's one of our favorite anime shows.\n\nShe got an 81% and you dragged her for not getting a 90%.\n\nYou're the kind of parent that posts on Reddit: *I don't know why my adult daughter is distant with me...*\n\nInstead of mocking her...\n\n>Crunchyroll Streaming Service (yes, apparently this is a real thing)\n\n...take a step back and look at the facts:\n\n\u2022she's a good student\n\u2022she asked to watch a show *at your house* instead of asking to go to a party, etc....you could've made this a bonding moment\n\u2022she watched the show with adult supervision...adults who trust her with their young children\n\nIt sucks she ran off, but she ran to other adults nearby (so she did have some sense of safety), and you pushed her to this decision.\n\nIf you were my dad and gave me shit over 81%, I would no longer give a shit what you think about anything because your punishment is over the top.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. She\u2019s 17, crunchyroll has a free trial option so you didn\u2019t even have to pay anything, and it seems like a weird thing to fight over. That being said as a parent it is your rules your house and she blatantly disregarded it all. However once you made the decision to drag her back home you should have followed through on it, even if you were embarrassed by the whole situation at the neighbors house. You\u2019re setting a weird double standard that your rules can apparently be broken if she can find some way to apply social peer pressure to you.\n\nThat all being said, this really shouldn\u2019t have been an issue to begin with. 5 minutes of google would have revealed that crunchy roll has free trials, AOT is in fact a big thing, and your daughter is old enough to watch it.

Crunchyroll has been operating for nearly 30 years, it\u2019s a whole-ass American company. Anime has been a thing since the early 1900s.\n\nWhat the hell was the plan when she graduates high school? All you\u2019ve done is create a monumentally underprepared adult that won\u2019t be able to function at the same level as her peers, and that is due to your nearly-criminally abusive, sad excuse for parenting.\n\nAnd yeah, *I can* read all of that from your sugarcoated post.", "YTA.\n\nYou said she lied about her grades, but only assumed a round up (which yeah, would've been wrong), yet she still got an A.\n\nBesides this clarification, I just want you to understand that you got over a \"threatening my daughter to force enter the room\", and results in her leaving the house and acting the way she did over a few bucks.\n\nI do not live in the states, nor am I a parent, but as a son, I can tell you that strict parents don't make better kids, they just make them better at lying.", "YTA. What is wrong in your life that you pick fights this petty with your own child?", "YTA\n\nYou seem like  a judgmental parent that neither respects her hobbies or even cares to understand them. Is there anything you care about in life at all? Watching sports? Following TV shows? Reading the news? You have no empathy at all for something your daughter obviously cares deeply about which only makes me think your life is a hollow joyless mess and you want your daughter to suffer the same. \n\nAlso it's the year 2023 old man. Internet friends are just as real as regular friends. I've been happily married to my husband for over 10 years from being internet friends first.", "OP, I can be as strict a dad as the next person, but... imagine instead how this could have gone: your almost-adult daughter asks to see the Titan finale. You look into it, get a free trial, sit down and watch it with her, she tells you she got an 81 on her exam and you congratulate her (it wasn't a requirement for this), and she explains the show to you over popcorn and hot chocolate. Nobody gets punished, freaks out, and your daughter doesn't make plans to stop visiting you for the rest of your life. Doesn't that sound better?", "YTA. The way you say \"internet friends\" I kinda feel you don't think they're \"real friends\". Buddy, this is their world, not ours. I don't understand why my son enjoys watching others play games streaming, but I wouldn't stop him just cuz I didn't \"get it\". Sheesh, chill out a bit dad. You'll lose her.", "YTA. She's 17 not 10. Why would she need to ask to go to a house down the street and watch a show with her friends?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i didn't bother to read the part about the grade before now but you're an asshole about that too.", "YTA - At 17 I was staying out till 2AM and getting into all types of trouble and you\u2019re blowing your stack over you kid sneaking out to watch anime \n\nAlso if you cared in the slightest you would have looked into it and seen there was a free week trial but instead you jumped straight to locking something that is clearly a big deal to her behind the ridiculous demand of a 90% grade on a test\n\nYour kid is going to remember this along with all of the other extremely controlling bullshit you probably put her through and will grow to resent you", "YTA\n\nCrunchyroll is the biggest streaming service for anime. They even host comic con conventions every year. Plus, there's a free trial and it is only $8 a month to get the ad free version... all of that is pretty easy to see with a simple Google search.\n\nAnd yeah, Attack on Titan is one of the biggest animes at the moment. It's been going on for 12 years and this finale has been one of the most anticipated events in the community. \n\nAnd why emphasize \"Internet\", like they're not real friends? Everything about this post screams that you think anything your daughter likes is inferior. \n\nDude, I get it. You value education, but that's too far. Is your daughter not allowed any interests outside of school? 81% on an exam for an AP class with a high fail rate is not good enough to watch ONE EPISODE of a show ?", "Be a helicopter parent. It always worked out for kids.", "Oh no not (INTERNET) friends!!! What is your daughter thinking?!?! Yes, YTA. Settle down unless you don't care to have a relationship with her when she leaves the house.", ">(yes, apparently this is a real thing)\n\nyou literally came to the internet for advice and then acted like the internet wouldn't have a clue what you're talking about lmao crunchyroll isn't some foreign concept, neither are memes or having internet friends, how old are you? \ud83d\ude06\n\nYTA, not because your daughter snuck out, but because you've clearly strained the relationship between you and your daughter so much that she felt she had to run off to begin with. You can't be shocked that your kid is trying to distance themselves from you when you're this controlling over her life and privacy, don't be surprised if this turns into full on no-contact after she becomes a legal adult and isn't subject to the court order of split custody anymore.\n\nIt's a finale for a show that's been running for 10 years now, she's not out doing drugs or drinking. If it was the money that was the issue, why not just sign up for a free trial if all she wanted to watch was the finale? No one was making this into a real issue except for you and it was a really weird hill to die on.\n\n(ironically, it might click if you watch Zeke's backstory, because his entire plot arc is about how he carried a grudge against his parents due to their extreme expectations of him. but I doubt you'd be willing to do that judging by your attitude towards this whole situation lmao)", "YTA and a very condescending one at that.", "YTA because wow what a massive over reaction. You act like she was asking to go to a party. She was literally asking to watch ONE episode of a show live that she really likes. That is so insane that you couldn\u2019t do ONE nice thing for her with no strings attached. Not every single nice thing in her life has to be earned. Do you even know how grateful she would have been if you had just said yes??? Instead you blow it up into a huge fucking thing. And yea, the parents of those kids are right to feel sorry for her. She sounds like a good kid. She\u2019s in AP biology for fucks sake. Cut her some slack. She\u2019s already done something massively impressive for her age, literally just having the self motivation to go for an AP class alone is something to be extremely proud of her for. That alone could have been rewarded if you so badly need to only do nice things as a reward\n\nand her grand old rebellion was\u2026.going to the house of the kids she babysits to watch a show??? OP, do you know how many kids in my high school did xanax? I went to an incredibly prestigious, incredibly difficult high school. Loads of kids probably just like your daughter. And yet our school was so fucked up with kids addicted to xanax to the point that they hired a! addictions counselor. You better pray that your sweet kid doesn\u2019t decide to lash out more", "She\u2019s 17, she could be doing drugs, partying, sneaking into clubs and bars, drinking. I\u2019m her age and know plenty of people doing exactly that, so I\u2019m not exaggerating. My 16 year old cousin does it regularly. Maybe you should be grateful that her biggest rebellion is sneaking out to watch anime\ninstead of being so controlling over a TV show.", "OP\u2019s like this is so sad. And they almost NEVER REPLY after getting called out for being TA. Bro cmon have some balls and respond to the comments lol", "YTA\n\nI say this because you seem to be very dismissive of your daughter's feelings, interests, and friends, and apparently for no reason other than you don't give a shit.\n\nAs an artist, I'd say AoT is a very important piece of anime, both in style and quality. Further, it has near-unbelievable ratings, especially in the past year.\n\nAs a teacher, I'd like to tell you that it is quite possible that a grade of 81% could go up to an A if the teacher is grading on a curve. This sometimes happens when a test is unintentionally difficult for students. If a teacher finds that not a single student got over 90%, that would suggest they inadvertently made the test too hard, and an 81% could absolutely be raised to an A.\n\nOut of curiosity, why are you so dismissive of the things that you're daughter is into. You apparently don't like that she has friends online; you don't seem to even want to feign interest in anime, which is obviously a passion of your daughter; you think it's ridiculous to get upset about something that means the world to her, and I'm willing to bet you are very vocal on how ridiculous you think she is being.", "YTA. Massively. And just reading this post you sound like an awful, control freak of a parent.\n\nYou can literally get a free trial to this service. Instead of letting your kid watch a single episode of a show that makes her happy, you used it as an opportunity to punish them and make them, instead of focusing on good exam results, stress because you tied an incentive to it?\n\nOh, and also, saying (FRIENDS) like that doesn't mean the relationships she's developed with people online are insignificant. It's honestly no wonder she chooses to befriend people over the internet when the alternative would be spending time with family like you..\n\nWelcome to the world of your child rebelling because you are refusing her perfectly reasonable requests because you have control issues.

Your post is a pretty clear snapshot of a parent who is condescending about their child's interests and makes no effort to understand them.  Like you,  I hadn't heard of Crunchyroll but it took me 30 seconds of googling to discover that it's a legit, well established and popular streaming service.  I am not an Anime fan, and neither is my husband,  so it's not a big surprise that I didn't know about it but that you didn't make an effort to find out about it is kind of pathetic.  The way you write \n\n>all her (INTERNET) friends were watching, etc. \n\n...as though \"internet\" is a euphemism for \"imaginary\" made me sad for your daughter.  You just don't take an active interest in learning about her life beyond your own narrow priorities.

Also I assume AP Bio is hard, so an 81 is still pretty damn good. If she goes NC in the near future, please, don't be surprised. Also regarding your response on why you may be the asshole, just for context, AOT has been running for 10 years, fans have been waiting for this for a long time. The most recent season, season 4, has been split into multiple different parts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 Part 1, Part 3 Part 2), so yeah, it's pretty special.

Again a B is a solid grade.)\n\nMy kids \"know\" ahead of time that breaking clearly stated rules results in a loss of certain privileges. My kids aren't kids anymore and they were pretty easy to deal with, particularly because we kept reasonable expectations at the forefront and did not criticize them for their successes.

And she'd face a reasonable loss of privilege for the stress and worry she put you through. But, YTA for telling her a B isn't good enough.

You don\u2019t have to like what she likes or think the show is good, you just need to care that she cares about it. That\u2019s what good parents do. \n\nTeaching kids to be obedient is overrated. All that does is make it easy for authority figures to take advantage of them. Teaching kids to truly respect one another is far more valuable, and you do that by showing respect for them and what they care about. You teach respect by demonstrating respect.

There are streaming services for all niches nowadays. Anime is very popular, so it\u2019s not a surprise (or at least, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise) that a streaming service exists for it.\n\n\u201cInitially, I said no but she kept asking. She didn\u2019t drop the issue & explained it was the show\u2019s finale, it was the biggest show on television, all her (INTERNET) friends were watching, etc.\u201d\n\nInternet friends are still friends. People on the Internet are real people\u2026 and you\u2019re asking people on the Internet for their opinions right now\u2026 \n  \n\u201cFriday rolled around, & she texted that she got an A on her exam & asked for Crunchyroll. When I checked Powerschool myself I saw she got 81%. I texted her this to which she responded that the 81% would be \u201ccurved\u201d to 90%, which is clearly BS.\u201d\n\nPlenty of exams are curved\u2026 if the highest grade in the class was 91%, then yes, her grade could be curved to 90%. Hard exams do get curved, they get curved in high school, and they even get curved in college.\n\n\u201cShe said this was a special occasion and important to her, etc. When my answer remained no, she started crying (which I find a bit ridiculous over a show) & locked herself in her bedroom.\u201d\n\nBut you see how much the show means to her and you\u2019re denying her one small thing that she really wants that doesn\u2019t even cost much money at all. She\u2019s almost an adult, there are a lot of things she could be doing or things she could be asking for, but all she wanted was to watch one show, in your home, and you denied her that. \n  \n\u201cMy ex-wife & I then each called our neighbors, which is how we discovered Ava was at a house down the street from mine of two boys she babysat. We learned their family had a Crunchyroll subscription & Ava had texted asking if she could watch & they said yes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a direct consequence of your actions. Being controlling will cause kids to become rebellious. And it\u2019s not even like she was being incredibly rebellious because she just went a few houses down to WATCH A SHOW. That should show you how much the show means to her\u2026 again, she could be doing so much worse at that age and all she wants to do is watch one episode of a show.\n\n\u201cbut the couple explained the show was, in fact, quite popular & ended that night. They were actually watching with Ava & seemed sympathetic. I wasn\u2019t in any hurry to seem like a bad person in front of this family, so I agreed to let her stay as long as she came back home right after.\u201d\n\nSo you didn\u2019t want to look like a bad person in front of another family, but you have no problem being a bad person in front of your daughter. That\u2019s the issue. She had to go find sympathy and understanding from a family that\u2019s not even her own\u2026 when she couldn\u2019t find it from you. \n\n\u201cI feel the punishment is justified\u2013she lied & ran away & hid her location! But she finds it incredibly unfair, & the neighbors seem to agree that The Attack On Titan's finale was important. AITA?\u201d\n\nYou should have tried to understand what the show was, why she found it so important, and you could have been a part of that moment for her. But instead, she had to go to someone\u2019s else\u2019s house to find happiness. So yes, YTA.", "YTA and you know it.\n\n>I wasn't in any hurry to seem like a bad person in front of this family\n\nThat right there is quite telling if you wanna take a step back and think of what you're doing to your kid. If yours was a reasonable approach, you wouldn't worry about seeming like a \"bad person\" in front of other people.\n\nSure, she shouldn't have snuck out. But teenagers do stupid shit, they always have, and they always will. One of the important things **you** can do as a parent is not be the reason they do stupid shit. She may have made the decision to sneak out but you were certainly the catalyst for it, given that she tried to communicate to you that the show is important to her and you chose to dismiss that almost entirely.\n\nShows and media in general like that can be important to people in itself, especially large event-like releases, like finales. But in this case, it was also important to her social interactions. You essentially directly would've resulted in her feeling socially excluded. I'm sure there's plenty of research on the importance of social inclusion amongst adolescents. Like yeah, sure maybe none of this actually matters in the long run, and that it's \"just a show\" or however else you wanna put it. But, she isn't there in her development yet and it matters to her, and it matters because all these things build up and affect her developing relationship with you, and what that relationship is going to be like 10 years from now. \n\nYou don't need to try to control every aspect of her life. She's a kid, let her be one and let her enjoy things she enjoys as long as it's not harming her or anyone else. She's doing just fine in school (it's honestly better for her to understand the material and score 81% than simply be good at cramming information and regurgitating on a test and scoring 95%, especially the way our general education systems work) and she has a social life, online or otherwise - there isn't really as big a delineation as you think there is between \"internet\" and IRL.

I will call her Ava. The previous Sunday (10/29) she asked if we could get the Crunchyroll Streaming Service (yes, apparently this is a real thing) so that she could watch the finale of it live when it aired. Initially, I said no but she kept asking. She didn\u2019t drop the issue & explained it was the show\u2019s finale, it was the biggest show on television, all her (INTERNET) friends were watching, etc.  \n\n\n  \nOn Monday Ava continued to text nonstop about Crunchyroll (she lives with my ex-wife during the week), & I eventually agreed to subscribe for a month if she got above 90% on the AP Biology exam she had on Tuesday.  \n\n\n  \nFriday rolled around, & she texted that she got an A on her exam & asked for Crunchyroll. When I checked Powerschool myself I saw she got 81%. I texted her this to which she responded that the 81% would be \u201ccurved\u201d to 90%, which is clearly BS. Ava arrived at my house Saturday morning & immediately asked for Crunchyroll, I told her NO, & she got upset. She said this was a special occasion and important to her, etc. When my answer remained no, she started crying (which I find a bit ridiculous over a show) & locked herself in her bedroom.  \n\n\n  \nAt dinnertime I knocked on her door she didn\u2019t answer. I threatened to unlock the door, no answer, so I did, & she wasn\u2019t in the room. I don\u2019t know when, but at some point, she left my house. I immediately called my ex-wife, who hadn\u2019t seen her, & we flipped out. Ava hid her location on Find My iPhone. We called the parents of her friends, no dice. My ex-wife & I then each called our neighbors, which is how we discovered Ava was at a house down the street from mine of two boys she babysat. We learned their family had a Crunchyroll subscription & Ava had texted asking if she could watch & they said yes.  \n\n\n  \nIt was mortifying to pick her up & explain to this family that Ava had left without permission. They were watching The Attack On Titan when we arrived. I wanted her to return home immediately, but the couple explained the show was, in fact, quite popular & ended that night. They were actually watching with Ava & seemed sympathetic. I wasn\u2019t in any hurry to seem like a bad person in front of this family, so I agreed to let her stay as long as she came back home right after.  \n\n\n  \nShe did as I instructed, & tried to evade punishment by saying how happy she was to have watched the show. Still, I grounded her & took away her phone for the weekend, the latter of which made her upset again because apparently NOW she had to go online & discuss the show with her (INTERNET) friends & look at \u201cmemes\u201d about it. When I didn\u2019t relent, she said she\u2019d refuse to stay at my house for the rest of the year. I still took her phone, & she\u2019s ignored me all day.  \n\n\n  \nI feel the punishment is justified\u2013she lied & ran away & hid her location! But she finds it incredibly unfair, & the neighbors seem to agree that The Attack On Titan's finale was important. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Let the girl have crunchy roll.  If you don\u2019t like the idea maybe, sit down with your daughter AND WATCH WITH HER and try to understand why she\u2019s interested. Bond with her. If you just punish her without even doing any of that\u2026 sorry bro YTA. Children are the reflection of their parents.

In my ap class, EVERY exam taken in our classroom WAS curved. The only one NOT curved is the standardized test to see if she gets the college credit. And given she got an 81% on the exam, it's likely she got a 3 or 4 and passed it. So you can't say for sure if she's lying or not (and even if she is, it's your fault for wanting a 90% in an AP class, which are notorious for their difficulty and being worse than dual enrollment classes and signing up at a college as a highschool student).\nI've been watching AOT since I was a good 11 years old. I'm 19 in less than 3 hours. You just cannot admit you are that out of touch from your daughter. An 81% is NOT going to kill her. That's a B.

It\u2019s been a long journey and she wants to see how it ends, I understand grades are important in your house as you\u2019ve said but does an 81% really warrant you not allowing her to watch a television show ? \n\nI will say though she definitely didn\u2019t have to watch the show on crunchyroll and could have found it on a third party site that streams it and not even told you about it at all.", "YTA, and honestly, you need to get with the times before your daughter starts realizing life is more chill without you as involved in it.

If my daughter wanted to watch the season finale of an anime she really likes and enjoys, I would NOT take that away from her, instead I\u2019d ask for her to explain why she likes it. I\u2019d use it as a way to BOND with my child. The fact you\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s 10 and not 17 is honestly pathetic and disgusting. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she does end up cutting all contact with you and not just over this, but the fact you feel the need to try and police every little thing she does.

Maybe by American standards, but for people who are serious about education, 81 is basically a fail.", "OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s grades are also excellent!", "If daughter offers to pay for it, if dad signs up and dad refuses then he would clearly be an A H. But I still think daughter could offer to pay. What\u2019s clear is that Mom has refused to sign up for it, as OP and daughter wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation if daughter had a subscription.", "Better to ask forgiveness and whatnot. Lol", "appreciate your comment back, you pose some statements that I as well agree with- specifically that she was wrong for taking such drastic measures and running away from home, because at the end of the day she is a minor and her parents are 100% responsible for her- like you stated.\n\nhowever, i feel as though regarding his age in the grand matter of this discussion- although yes he is 49, isnt necessarily a complete excuse for his criticism. i would expect that especially at that age, and when i become a parent in the future, i take the time out to understand my childs likes/hobbies and keep an open mind to things like (INTERNET) friends. just because he is 49 and wasnt brought up with the same things that the younger generation has now doesnt warrant some of the ignorant perspectives he has about \"internet friends\" and \"finding it ridiculous that she was crying over a show\"\n\nalso your point you make saying that it is an indicator on how the real world works is true- but why at the expense of something like grades? from personal experience this doesnt have the greatest impact on child's mental health in the long run imo and secondly he was calling BS to the fact that there was no way a 81 could be curved to a 90? (which like i mentioned before is something that is infact common in AP classes) he honestly could have done something better like giving her x amount of chores or something less detrimental seeing that it was literally for a show she wanted to watch\n\nalso i didnt mean quick to punish in the sense of the literal punishment, while it is true that he grounded her AFTER she was reckless and ran away, he could have used it as an opportunity to understand his daughter better, reflect on his own actions and approach to the original situation that started it all and educate her on the fact that he didnt mean it in a bad way but she is still a minor and he is legally responsible for her vs just grounding her and making the entire situation seem in a negative light", "With how controlling this guy is, she likely is only able to have internet friends because he socially sabotaged her into being a social outcast in her school/area.\n\nShe's 17, wasn't grounded prior. Yet, he grounded her for going out to a friends house to watch a show. ? I wonder what else goes on in that home..", "Yeah but his requirement had nothing to do with that, it was totally arbitrary. If he said Ava has to pay for the service that would make sense. Clearly this wasn't about the money. Teens aren't stupid, they can tell when parents are being controlling for no reason and that's exactly what OP is doing.", "A 17 yo that needs to sneak out to watch a harmless show. Of course her father is TA. She is 17, not 10. I am a mother myself and I cannot imagine putting grades above a relationship with my kids.", "I'm also in my 40s and I don't understand his very Boomerish attitude here. We were the originals with online friends. We were the trailblazers on the internet. And he's behaving like he just learned people talk to each other online. lol", "While he's ON THE INTERNET asking for peoples' opinions.", "In this same vein it seems very hypocritical to be judgmental about her INTERNET friends and the turn to Reddit for advice. Like, WTF?", "I graduated high school 17 years ago and it was a thing then. College we had it too. I think he just didn't care and didn't want her to watch anime. Some people have this weird thing against anime but will watch western cartoons. It's all the same. I find anime has better story lines.", "She can find another roof.", "Yea, OP is giving very much boomer energy. He should not be surprised if she cuts him out of her life.", "Totally. Grade boundaries are a real thing!", "81 is absolutely not a fail. In the UK our papers have questions that are worth several points. The difference between achieving 90 on a test and 81 on a test could be literally getting one question wrong. Depending on grade boundaries, it's the difference here between say a low A at GCSE level and a high B.", "81 is an A. 'Basically a fail' if you come from an archaic family, perhaps. 81 is great in MOST countries.", "A B is not a fail.\n\nYou know what they call the ones who got Cs in med school?", "An 81 is an A. It's an A. An A is good. An A is not a fail.", "I had assumed she watched it at her mum's place but had to be at her dad's when the finale was on. Otherwise, why would she be excited about a show finale she doesn't already watch?", "Ok think you keeping missing the point\u2026 his age plays a massive role because in his eyes the entire idea of making friends on the \u201cinternet\u201d is just unfathomable to him. Not saying that shields him from criticism or lack of understanding for his daughters sake but it is his POV. \n\nAlso, if not grades WHAT ELSE? What other metric or thing could he have used to teach his daughter the lesson? Doing household chores? The same chores you are supposed to do everyday regardless? He used the only metric that mattered because it directly effects his daughter\u2019s career. Also I have never heard of any AP class curving a grade that much. I have seen one or two points but to go from 81(B-) to 90(A) is a stretch. If they are doing that NOW in schools then what\u2019s the point in AP classes at all? \n\nIf the father caves and just gives the daughter what\u2019s she wants she learns nothing other than she doesn\u2019t really have to try to get what she wants.", "Sometimes in life you need to hit a seemingly arbitrary goal in order to get something. Whether that's getting a certain grade or cleaning up your room to be allowed to watch TV, or having to work a certain amount of hours even if you could finish the work in less time in order to get paid. I work in a store/caf\u00e9 and we get a bonus if a certain amount of people buy something over the course of a month, which is an arbitrary number and something we don't even have that much influence over.", "Agreed. All these comments expect the kid to stop acting immature. It\u2019s pretty clear the parents treat her like a 12 yo child. If you treat them like children they will always be children.", "She basically did", "And another dad, who would care about her and her likings. This one seems too much old school to really have the right to educate her for our 2023's world.", "Doctors!", "i mean tbh you saying that his age playing a massive role in his perspective that \"making friends on the internet is just unfathomable\" is pretty much essentially in the same line of him saying \"Crunchyroll Streaming Service (yes, apparently this is a real thing)\". yeah at the end of the day its his POV but he could be doing better in terms of integrating his current mindset in alignment with his younger daughter/ understanding her better, bc if not i can easily foresee other arguments occurring in the future due to their differing mindsets\n\nalso fyi i was enrolled in 5 AP classes myself throughout my academic career, depending on the class size and how poorly the overall score was amongst students ive been incases where an 81 was readjusted to a 90 and the overall curve for the class was recalculated lol, but i cant really say anything about whats the point of having AP classes at all- just giving insight into the curving situation and the father immediately calling BS on it", "My daughters are 15 and 12. I don't treat my 12 yo as controlling and power- hungry as the OP does with his nearly adult daughter. \nWe have a loving and respectful relationship. Respect is a road that goes both ways."]}
