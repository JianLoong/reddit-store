I mean, I'm spending upwards of an hour just listening and adding \"mmhmm\" and \"oh wow\", because she says she gets even MORE distracted when I ask questions.\n\nI brought this up with Polly, and she said that I am asking her to mask her disorder, and that's just how her brain works.

Speaking from someone who has Autism, ADHD, and can really relate to your wife's experiences (also have a long time gf w/ both as well) it is something that happens to us where 1. Time management is something many of us struggle with on accident, she may not realize just how much time she's taking up, or she might realize but is still trying to learn how to stop herself, and many of us with ADHD are also autistic, and if she happens to be or she is and doesn't know it, the autism part of the neurodivergency may make her not realize that you're not paying attention and you're following along to pity her essentially. I read the comment that you do the \"I'm actually not paying attention so I give a half-assed response\" thing of saying \"mhm\" \"uh-huh\", etc. Don't do that, it makes us feel worse. Either fully pay attention or don't. \n\nBut the fact that she hasn't caught on to the fact that you're not even fully paying attention leans me towards that she is autistic too as well as ADHD and doesn't know since she's not picking up the social cue of it. \n\nWe are also very verbose people accidentally, with those of us who are ADHD and autistic. As you can see from my response even that I don't know if what I'm saying and added context is important, because to me everything feels equally important to mention and not leave out. We genuinely don't mean malice by it, it just happens.\n\nAlso by her comment with masking: Especially if she's talking a lot and having to deal with people on a daily basis like a sales position or an office job with phones, it becomes mentally and can eventually physically painful. After a long day, those of us who have to mask to function in society want to be able to drop the mask at home and especially around the people we love. Especially since you married her, she likely wants to trust and feel safe at home to be her true, authentic self, neurodivergencies and all.\n\nShe can get help for these things though, I manage it through therapy and medication personally. So in that way it is on her that she's not trying to manage her condition, which could help her a lot with many aspects of her neurodivergency long term.\n\n\n***As to what you can do with it: Maybe while she's at work, you can ask her to text you about her day instead, that way she's updating you throughout the day and the conversations are shorter in the evenings. I also recommend you doing research on neurodivergent experiences and things you can do to be a supportive partner to her and then work together to see if those things can aid her and help you two reclaim your evenings together.***", "NAH.

The reason why this is important varies from person to person. Or even day to day. For me, not being able to share my thoughts/feelings about my day will often lead to insomnia because my brain can\u2019t process all the thoughts/feelings without getting them out. \n\nThis, however, does not mean you shouldn\u2019t also get a chance to talk about things that are on your mind! This is a fairly common struggle in relationships where one person is neurodivergent and the other is neurotypical. \nI suggest sitting her down and explaining how you feel without putting too much emphasis on what\u2019s bothering you about her way of sharing details about her day and instead try to focus on how you feel when you can\u2019t share your thoughts with her and make it clear that you want to find a solution that works for both of you. You mention that you eat separately. Maybe she can use her dinner time to write down her scattered thoughts. That might give her an overview of what\u2019s actually important for her to tell you and what\u2019s not. This is something that helps me a lot because I find it easier to think before I type but when I speak I usually just blurt out what\u2019s on my mind. \n\nAnother advice I have for you is to try and find a support group for friends/relatives/partners of neurodivergent people. It\u2019s a great way to educate yourself and share your experiences with people who can relate!\n\nI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t also get educated (and treated) if she hasn\u2019t been already, she absolutely should!", "NAH.

If she has some form of ADHD she might be info dumping which is how she connects with other people.\n\nIf what you are asking was possible she wouldn't be neurodivergent. She'd be neurotypical. \n\nA solution might be to talk about your stuff first or alternate days where you share and she shares if the timing is hard. \n\nFor autistic people the tangents are context setting. Our neurons are cross wired. It seems logical and it seems like after a whole day of masking coming home to mask is the least appealing thing. \n\nI dated someone who couldn't handle it and we ended things because he'd pout when it would happen. So I left because a life of masking at home and outside is just so exhausting I'd be miserable. I'm highly functional/very low support needs too. I'm not sure it's mild. I call it well managed.

You need to start with: I love you, and I want to hear about your day, but I want to be able to share too. It hurts my feelings when I don\u2019t have a chance to share.  Neurodivergent people often need to hear this plainly. They arent motivated by selfishness, but their behavior ends up making it feel that way unintentionally. \n\nSo agree upon a set time and set a timer. One of you goes first, then switch. Assure her if she is not done, she will have another turn. It will help her to put effort into organizing her thoughts. It works. \n\nNeurodivergence doesn't mean you should be expected to just accept her ways, end of discussion. Like all of us, she needs to practice skills that are more challenging for her. Relationships and communication must be reciprocal. It\u2019s not asking her to \u201cmask\u201d- it\u2019s asking her to have empathy for her partner. Don\u2019t allow it to be framed in that manner in your relationship. In any relationship, one person doing all the accommodating is not healthy or okay. \n\nAs her partner, you will need to communicate with more intention and explicitness. Another person may suddenly notice \u201coh! I\u2019m hogging the conversation!

For me, branching out like that is the only way I can really vent. The side bits may seem irrelevant to my partner, but they aren't to me. Not being able to get it out is, in a way, worse than just not talking and keeping it all bottled up. It's important to remember that talking about your day is as much for her as it is for you. You may be bored, but it sounds like it's an important release for her. You could always suggest her writing it down, too. Journaling might be a helpful release so she doesn't feel like she has to vent everything to you. It could also help her organize her thoughts.

For example, maybe you like her voice, or you like how she talks quickly when she gets excited, you like how she can sort of zone out when she's thinking about something, or maybe she's just daaaamn fine to you and you like looking at her. Pick something that you enjoy about the way she talks and just be an ear to talk at while you continue to fall in love with her. If she picks up that you're not fully listening just state that you were distracted by her beauty or just sort of lost in admiring her.\n\nShe's likely been masking all day to her coworkers and the public, and you are the only person that she feels comfortable around not having to do that, it's the only time she can actually relax.\n\nSo, NTA because I absolutely understand how mentally fatiguing it is keeping up with those stories, but also YTA because she's your partner and you're the only person she can feel comfortable not having to restrain herself for. If you make her feel guilty for speaking comfortably with you, she'll start to feel distant from you; it doesn't matter if you're right in saying her story is boring, if the end result of that path is she ends up leaving you.\n\n\nEDIT: Another point towards not being the asshole is if you accommodate her like I've said here, you'll end up feeling distant from her because you'll end up feeling like you can't even get a word in edgewise. So perhaps, if you really want to talk about your day or how you're feeling, you should lead off with confiding in her and tell her what's bothering you about today, she may continue to branch off based on your story and may overtake you, but that's when you just have to calmly and gently nudge her back into providing comfort.", "Does she actually have a diagnosis or is she self-diagnosed?", "NTA, and unless wife is in therapy and medicated, she's just being selfish and self-centered.", "Bruh.

Masking is what we do to hide our disorders from people who we need to pretend to be neurotypical around. Like when I\u2019m at work, or in public.

It is absolutely something she should work on, for the sake of your relationship and because she (hopefully) loves you.\n\nA lot of neurodivergent people, I have noticed, will try and absolve any self improvement by claiming others are being ableist, or telling them to mask. Its extremely frustrating; having a neurodivergency doesn\u2019t mean you can just stop bettering yourself. Like sure, you\u2019ll never be the same as a neurotypical. But understanding your behaviors and working to improve them as best you can is important to functioning in society. Like, someone with Tourettes cannot control having tics, but they can remove themself from a crowded space full of kids if their tic involves saying something inappropriate. Or in your wife\u2019s case, she can recognize when you want to talk too and let you speak. \n\nAnyways, I hope you can find a way to get this through to her.

Once we figured it out, it opened up a whole new toolbox of ways to communicate and resolve issues. We got into a fight last night. Ostensibly, she was in the wrong. While expressing my issue with her behavior, I descended to a position of hyperbole and condescension. She apologized. I apologized. We had a great conversation about why we do those things.

Their minds go on tangents they can't control. Internal restlessness also can feel like anxiety, not wanting to deal with external stimuli, not being able to focus on external stimuli because their mind is \"too loud\" or too full of racing thoughts, having a hard time doing just one thing-even if it's something you like, etc. For example, a lot of people with ADHD-PI could sit quietly while a movie is on, but feel compelled to pick up their phone to play games or browse social media because they need more stimulation than just the movie.
