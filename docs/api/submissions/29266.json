Then, afterwards, we sit in the living room and shoot the shit.\n\nPolly has a mild neurodivergence that means she tells... let's call it \"branching\" stories. She will get bogged down in sidestories and background stories and details that, frankly, add nothing to the core story about her workday. That's usually fine, but I've noticed it getting a bit worse, to the point that, by the time she's done, it's basically time to watch a show and go to bed. I mean, I'm spending upwards of an hour just listening and adding \"mmhmm\" and \"oh wow\", because she says she gets even MORE distracted when I ask questions.\n\nI brought this up with Polly, and she said that I am asking her to mask her disorder, and that's just how her brain works. I get that feeling, I really do, but I am starting to feel like I'm a side character here, because she takes up all the airtime that we set aside to debrief.\n\nHere's why I might be an AH: I said \"well, we all change our communication styles based on context, right?\" And she said that's different, and that masking is not code switching.\u00a0\n\nI just want some time to talk about my day, too, but I don't want her to feel bad.

Speaking from someone who has Autism, ADHD, and can really relate to your wife's experiences (also have a long time gf w/ both as well) it is something that happens to us where 1. Time management is something many of us struggle with on accident, she may not realize just how much time she's taking up, or she might realize but is still trying to learn how to stop herself, and many of us with ADHD are also autistic, and if she happens to be or she is and doesn't know it, the autism part of the neurodivergency may make her not realize that you're not paying attention and you're following along to pity her essentially. I read the comment that you do the \"I'm actually not paying attention so I give a half-assed response\" thing of saying \"mhm\" \"uh-huh\", etc. Don't do that, it makes us feel worse. Either fully pay attention or don't. \n\nBut the fact that she hasn't caught on to the fact that you're not even fully paying attention leans me towards that she is autistic too as well as ADHD and doesn't know since she's not picking up the social cue of it. \n\nWe are also very verbose people accidentally, with those of us who are ADHD and autistic. As you can see from my response even that I don't know if what I'm saying and added context is important, because to me everything feels equally important to mention and not leave out. We genuinely don't mean malice by it, it just happens.\n\nAlso by her comment with masking: Especially if she's talking a lot and having to deal with people on a daily basis like a sales position or an office job with phones, it becomes mentally and can eventually physically painful. After a long day, those of us who have to mask to function in society want to be able to drop the mask at home and especially around the people we love. Especially since you married her, she likely wants to trust and feel safe at home to be her true, authentic self, neurodivergencies and all.\n\nShe can get help for these things though, I manage it through therapy and medication personally. So in that way it is on her that she's not trying to manage her condition, which could help her a lot with many aspects of her neurodivergency long term.\n\n\n***As to what you can do with it: Maybe while she's at work, you can ask her to text you about her day instead, that way she's updating you throughout the day and the conversations are shorter in the evenings. I also recommend you doing research on neurodivergent experiences and things you can do to be a supportive partner to her and then work together to see if those things can aid her and help you two reclaim your evenings together.***", "NAH.
