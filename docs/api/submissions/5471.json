Your BF IS a bad person for repeatedly asking you for something you have REPEATEDLY told him no for. And for good reason because nude pictures are just asking for trouble.

You should leave now before he breaks your wonderful willpower and spirit down. This is a major red flag, it is YOUR body.

He IS a bad person. So why do you put up with that? Date a guy who respects your boundaries.\n\nIMO nudes are kind of unnecessary. In this day and age there's porn everywhere but you need it to be specifically MY tits? Puh-leaze.  Besides, these things are better in the flesh. I'd much rather have sex than send some pixelated amateur porn from some awful angle. \n\nAnd if you do send them, should be cropped with your face not in the picture, and even then only to someone you habe been with for years and years who had proven trustworthy. \n\nAs you point out, a lot of young men share the nudes theory receive from their girlfriends.  Or keep them after they break up. Or post them on revenge porn sites. Cloud storage gets hacked. Phones get stolen. I've never sent nudes to my partner- he has the real thing and that does him just fine ;) \n\nAnd currently, women in most countries can get fired from their jobs if their nudes get leaked. As well as suffering socially. On top of that, spreading revenge porn is not a crime in many countries and remains hard to prosecute and hard to get off the internet if it gets leaked.\n\nIn this day and age, sending nudes just is not worth it for women. I respect those who do, and they absolutely deserve to have those nudes treated appropriately.\n\n But no woman should be made to feel mad if she is not comfortable with it. \n\nHonestly, the fact he keeps asking for the nudes despite you not being comfortable is proof that you should Definitely not be sending them to him. Red flag for sure.", "NTA. Do what you feel is necessary to avoid future problems. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as they say, and you are right that this is something that could impact your future without probably having any consequences for him.\n\nIf he's pushy and whiny about it, he's actually making your case for you, honestly, because a good person wouldn't push once you set a boundary.", "NTA and I understand you 100% I've had a guy threaten to post some things I've sent to him.

You should have huge, giant red flags waving in your face right now about this guy.

You sound relatively young, but smart enough to know that kind of thing can and does happen. \nRegardless, no is a complete answer and you are, in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM, obligated to send anyone nudes. Him asking so many times shows a blatant disrespect for your bodily autonomy. \nAlso, if you are under the age of 18, sending nudes is illegal, so\u2026there\u2019s that too. \nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable with the idea for any reason at all, don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. You are not saying you don't \"trust him\" per se, just that you don't engage in that behavior because it has too many potential negative outcomes and you don't want to put him or yourself in that position.
