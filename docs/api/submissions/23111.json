Here's what stands out to me. \n\nDuring your daughter's childhood, you seem obsessed with lying. What difference does it make if she went to McDonald's or Wendy's? Next to none, it's just a kid re-imagening past events. That's what you should have told her. Instead you chose to guilt trip her repeatedly by \"teaching her what lies cause\", even though her therapists said her lies were ok for her age. So back then, you were an AH towards your 8 year old child. \n\nThen there's you accepting her when she came out a lesbian. No AH there. \n\nThen there's the undisclosed episode that led to your ultimatum, which she refused, and then you threw her out. Normally, throwing out a recently diagnosed seriously mentally ill daughter is very bad. But perhaps you had done your best to help her and needed to protect yourself. We don't know, because you haven't told us.\n\nLastly there's the Facebook incident. Of course she's the AH for saying you threw her out a week after coming out, when in fact it was two years after, and probably related to her BPD rather than her being a lesbian.\n\nBut as you yourself has told us, this story runs deeper than this last event, and judging by your behavior in her childhood, I am going with ESH.", "NTA. your daughter committed defamation against you. that's really what that is. by extension, her workplace could be liable for the defamation considering it was published through them. you could even be fired for your job.", "I thought she was doing better until now.

Your daughter hurt you with her lies, and you have every right to defend yourself.\n\nAlso, it sounds to me like she was likely either misdiagnosed or only partially diagnosed. As someone who grew up in a family of people with severe BPD (including a mom who had the most severe case a therapist who'd specialized in treating BPD for decades had ever seen), and who has been through tons of therapy regarding that, I can say that BPD doesn't usually cause habitual lying. Manipulation, yes. But if lies are part of that manipulation, it's usually for a reason (that reason most often has to do with a deep seated fear of rejection and/or abandonment, whether realistic or not). It sounds like your daughter started habitually lying from a young age \"just because,\" and even she couldn't explain why she did it. Also, BPD usually gets *worse* with age, not better (short of receiving some pretty intensive treatment). And it often doesn't even go full blown until a person's late teens.\n\nI'm not at all saying your daughter doesn't have BPD. Just keep in mind that lots of therapists actively dislike people with BPD and will automatically assign that label to anyone who's particularly difficult. There are other conditions that are more often closely tied with habitual lying. BPD isn't one of them.\n\nEither way, I'm sorry your daughter put you through that. I can only imagine how hurtful that must feel, especially when you've done so much to be supportive.

There are millions of people going through the experiences your daughter wants to appropriate in order to appear marketable in todays society. She should have focused on lifting those people up. Her own insecurity on not having her own queer sob story is not a reason to lie about trauma. If she feels uncomfortable being in her position while having a supportive family, she should address that issue before taking that kind of job.\n\nPeople who have been abused by their families, queer people, the people she is supposed to be advocating for, get treated like liars all the time because people with the same opinions as your daughter feel it is ok to fabricate your backstory to get ahead. Not really Rachel Dolezal, but similar. The need to feel legitimate at any cost. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just on Reddit too much but young people seem to have gone in that direction. You can be whatever you want, including an abuse survivor. All without the crushing PTSD and inability to function.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. I hope your daughter is willing to continue to engage in treatment for her BPD as it seems it\u2019s badly affecting her career at the moment. Maybe follow up with her place of employment about the affect these lies will have on you - she needs workplace consequences so she doesn\u2019t keep lying about herself and becoming whatever she needs to be in the moment to get ahead.", "NTA. She is responsible for her behavior and her lies. Not you or your family.", "NTA, she tried to throw you under the bus, just for the attention. If it's appropriate, you could ask her and/or her girlfriend about how her treatment is going. Because it sounds like she could be having some issues.", "NTA but i'm not sure this level of lying is typical of someone of BPD (i assume you use it toean \"borderline personality disorder\" and not \"bipolar disorder)...i could be wrong, i don't have BPD myself afaik and most of what i know about it comes from close friends who have it...i've neven seen compulsive lying as a symptom of it. are you sure there's not something else going on? maybe she's misdiagnosed and has something different?\ni don't think there's much more you can do for her either way. hopefully her girlfriend can help her recover from whatever mental problems she has.", "\"It's just a way to get clicks\".  \n\nNTA but your daughter is for doing this for clicks.", "NTA she lied and defamed you. this goes beyond harmless lying since you were harassed because of it. you had every right to call her out", "Ehhh, what she did was really shitty but I think this is more akin to lying about being in the twin towers than lying about being raped. I have never seen a homophobe question if someone was lying about being kicked out by their parents for being gay.", "Lying is not a symptom of BPD.", "I would gently push back on the idea that she\u2019s harming the LGBTQ community in some way. If someone is prepared to withdraw their support of queer people because of hearing a story like this, they were clearly not actually supportive of queer people to begin with. This girl is seriously troubled, but the harmed party here is the family.\n\nYou see this argument used a lot in discussions about racism and sexism, too, and while it sucks when people lie, it\u2019s flawed logic to suggest that hatred or bigotry is ever caused by the people within the group. Bigotry is always the fault of bigot.", "She could absolutely have written a compelling and beautiful story about her experience coming out without vilifying you. The internet also loves stories of affirming parents who are overjoyed to know their beloved child a little bit better when they come out.", "I mean, she\u2019s mentally ill. Generally we don\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, interpret the actions of the mentally ill as representative of whatever other group they happen to be in.", "She's definitely better... at lying. Lying is a skill and she's been practicing since she was a little kid.", "If you could clarify, did you mean bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder? They share the same acronym.", "It\u2019s not but sometimes can be associated with their behavior.", "Except they have in fact shared the same acronym. It's perfectly possible it's being phased out and they finally have separate ones, but they definitely have (confusingly) shared them for quite awhile now.", "People shouldn't judge groups based off of individuals but people do. Bigots love to use individuals actions to try and make their hatred more credible", "I also have a \u201cDiagnosis\u201d. However\u2026I Do NOT LIE & invent Past Traumas and Post it to Social Media. Having a Mental Illness IS NOT a \u201cGet Out of Jail Free\u201d card.", "Lying, compulsively or otherwise, is not a symptom of BPD.", "Literally no one said it was, but go off I guess.", "My sister has BPD and lying is her default setting. If it gets her attention of any kind, she'll do it. She even took it so far as to lie about having an abortion to get out of cleaning her room. If you Google BPD lying there are several articles that explain the connection between those with BPD and their impulse to lie.", "Exactly\u2026 the lying is not because of BPD. Something else is wrong."]}
