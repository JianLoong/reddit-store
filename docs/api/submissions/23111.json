Here's what stands out to me. \n\nDuring your daughter's childhood, you seem obsessed with lying. What difference does it make if she went to McDonald's or Wendy's? Next to none, it's just a kid re-imagening past events. That's what you should have told her. Instead you chose to guilt trip her repeatedly by \"teaching her what lies cause\", even though her therapists said her lies were ok for her age. So back then, you were an AH towards your 8 year old child. \n\nThen there's you accepting her when she came out a lesbian. No AH there. \n\nThen there's the undisclosed episode that led to your ultimatum, which she refused, and then you threw her out. Normally, throwing out a recently diagnosed seriously mentally ill daughter is very bad. But perhaps you had done your best to help her and needed to protect yourself. We don't know, because you haven't told us.\n\nLastly there's the Facebook incident. Of course she's the AH for saying you threw her out a week after coming out, when in fact it was two years after, and probably related to her BPD rather than her being a lesbian.\n\nBut as you yourself has told us, this story runs deeper than this last event, and judging by your behavior in her childhood, I am going with ESH.", "NTA. your daughter committed defamation against you. that's really what that is. by extension, her workplace could be liable for the defamation considering it was published through them. you could even be fired for your job.", "I thought she was doing better until now.

Your daughter hurt you with her lies, and you have every right to defend yourself.\n\nAlso, it sounds to me like she was likely either misdiagnosed or only partially diagnosed. As someone who grew up in a family of people with severe BPD (including a mom who had the most severe case a therapist who'd specialized in treating BPD for decades had ever seen), and who has been through tons of therapy regarding that, I can say that BPD doesn't usually cause habitual lying. Manipulation, yes. But if lies are part of that manipulation, it's usually for a reason (that reason most often has to do with a deep seated fear of rejection and/or abandonment, whether realistic or not). It sounds like your daughter started habitually lying from a young age \"just because,\" and even she couldn't explain why she did it. Also, BPD usually gets *worse* with age, not better (short of receiving some pretty intensive treatment). And it often doesn't even go full blown until a person's late teens.\n\nI'm not at all saying your daughter doesn't have BPD. Just keep in mind that lots of therapists actively dislike people with BPD and will automatically assign that label to anyone who's particularly difficult. There are other conditions that are more often closely tied with habitual lying. BPD isn't one of them.\n\nEither way, I'm sorry your daughter put you through that. I can only imagine how hurtful that must feel, especially when you've done so much to be supportive.
