From little things like \u201cI had Wendy\u2019s for lunch\u201d when she had McDonalds all the way up to big things like \u201cI got into a fight at school\u201d when she didn\u2019t. We started her in therapy when she was around 8 years old to try to get to the root of it. Even she couldn\u2019t see why she was lying. We tried 3 different therapists but they all seemed to think it was age appropriate. My husband and I focused on teaching her what lies cause, making sure she knew she could come to us with anything, etc. We\u2019ve always been the type to let our kids make mistakes while knowing we\u2019ll always be there with no judgment, just there to help them do better.\n\nThings somewhat got better as she got older. There\u2019d be the occasional small white lie but when we talked about it, she got better. When Casey came out as a lesbian at 16, we were supportive and treated her girlfriend as one of the family.\n\nIssues arose when the lying began again and Casey became rather aggressive. We took her back to therapy and she was diagnosed with BPD. She refused treatment. We did all we could to get her in, but she was diagnosed shortly before she turned 18 so there was very little we could do. After a really bad incident, we told her she either seek help (that we\u2019d pay for) or she had to leave. She chose to leave. A few years later, she finally agreed to accept help. She\u2019s now 23 and doing a bit better.\n\nCasey works as a DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion) manager for a company. For pride month, the company showcased the LGBTQ+ employees, sharing their stories. I was excited to read Casey\u2019s when she shared it on Facebook.\n\nMy heart sank when I read it. Casey wrote that her parents were not at all supportive when she came out. She added that we had kicked her out of the house for a week after she told us, but took her back when we were \u201cguilted into it\u201d. I tried to reach out to Casey but she didn\u2019t answer.\n\nSo many people in her FB comment section were apologizing for the \u201ctraumatizing\u201d experience she went through. They were attacking myself and my husband. I finally commented that none of this was true and it was extremely hurtful to see this narrative spun.\n\nCasey finally got back to me and said I need to remove my comment. She said it\u2019s just a way to get clicks. I said it\u2019s a lie and she posted it so everyone can see, making us look bad. I shared how hurt I was that yet again, she was lying for attention. She then deleted my comment for me.\n\nI made a post showing the various pride events we went to, pictures of her girlfriend on vacation with us, even videos Casey took herself of the two of us discussing her journey, etc. I tagged Casey in it. Some still back her up, but most have apologized to me. Her girlfriend also finally called her out on it and said I\u2019ve always been nothing but nice to her. \n\nShe is mad at me, saying I\u2019m making her look bad and saying I don\u2019t understand how stuff like this works.

Here's what stands out to me. \n\nDuring your daughter's childhood, you seem obsessed with lying. What difference does it make if she went to McDonald's or Wendy's? Next to none, it's just a kid re-imagening past events. That's what you should have told her. Instead you chose to guilt trip her repeatedly by \"teaching her what lies cause\", even though her therapists said her lies were ok for her age. So back then, you were an AH towards your 8 year old child. \n\nThen there's you accepting her when she came out a lesbian. No AH there. \n\nThen there's the undisclosed episode that led to your ultimatum, which she refused, and then you threw her out. Normally, throwing out a recently diagnosed seriously mentally ill daughter is very bad. But perhaps you had done your best to help her and needed to protect yourself. We don't know, because you haven't told us.\n\nLastly there's the Facebook incident. Of course she's the AH for saying you threw her out a week after coming out, when in fact it was two years after, and probably related to her BPD rather than her being a lesbian.\n\nBut as you yourself has told us, this story runs deeper than this last event, and judging by your behavior in her childhood, I am going with ESH.", "NTA. your daughter committed defamation against you. that's really what that is. by extension, her workplace could be liable for the defamation considering it was published through them. you could even be fired for your job.", "I thought she was doing better until now.

Abusive parents though and you will get sympathy so people will lie for attention.\n\nLgbtq+ people are no different from any other people.
