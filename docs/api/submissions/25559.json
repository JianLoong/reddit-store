I put my meds in one of those weekly cases and take them daily, the pill bottle with remaining pills is on my dresser in my bedroom.  Last week, after not seeing my husband for several days, due to working, he mentioned to me that he's been taking my extra meds (Adderall for those wondering). I told him those weren't extra and after looking in the bottle told him that now I didn't have enough to get me through the rest of the month. I usually only take the adderal on days I'm working, because that's when I need to be focused (hence the extra sometimes), but I've been working a ton of overtime lately to catch up on bills. \n\nSo the following week, I'm back to working a ton of hours and barely being home. I go to fill my weekly med pack and the bottle of adderal is empty. I wake my husband to ask what happened. He replies that he finished them. I get upset and start yelling at him. He apologizes and says that he thought it would be ok, since I could take these (handing me my step son's medication). I am furious and explain to him that 1) I am not stealing my sons meds and 2) his meds are a different strength and long acting whereas mine are immediate release. (I do want to mention that my son just left for boot camp and won't be home for several months therefor doesnt \"need\" these). \n\nToday happens to be our anniversary and my husband is saying that I shouldn't be mad at him, he's sorry, blah blah blah.

He is using his mental health issues to control you by bringing up suicide as a way to keep you from being angry with him and that is abuse and both the abuse and the stealing are both really big red flags. First you need to take a few steps back and away from him to really see how you feel about all this. Then you need some place to lock up your medication and your sons since your husband can\u2019t be trusted. He needs to start talking to someone and getting his own medication. Also threatening suicide against you to get his way is grounds for you to file for divorce. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be treated this way.", "He needs to be on a 72 hour hold and you need to dump this thieving addict", "NTA, but is this really the life you envisioned for yourself? Your husband has problems far beyond your wheelhouse to assist with. He needs rehab and therapy and if he refuses both you need to make plans for your own therapy (if you aren't already getting it) and extricate yourself from this relationship. If he threatens suicide call the emergency line.", "Call an ambulance because he has indicated that he is a danger to himself. I think that\u2019s what you are supposed to do if someone threatens suicide.", "NTA. His choices are either going to rehab or being reported to the police for stealing your meds which will result in his arrest. You know he\u2019s been taking your meds for awhile & also probably taking your son\u2019s meds too, right? This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIs your license in jeopardy if you don\u2019t report him to the police?", "If he's diverting your controlled ADHD stimulant medication and has no clinical indication for this medication, he's likely already tipped the scales into substance induced mania/psychosis. Call 911 and get him petitioned.", "Once a druggie, always a druggie.", "NTA but get a lockbox for the meds. And tell him that threatening suicide is manipulative as fuck and to drop that shit.", "NTA. Call the cops if he threatens suicide. Even in marriage vows, no one says you have to stick with your partner through them trying to manipulate you with threats of violence.", "The kind that sells them. Know someone who got his child diagnosed so he can get Adderall but refuses to let his son take medicines like that so he does them instead and sells them \ud83d\ude44\nFunny enough he's a \"Mormon\"", "A friends an ex did this so I called the police and told them. He never threatened it to her again. He\u2019s still alive 15 years later", "This is the way to go. If someone threatened suicide in my presence, I would take them at their word, treat it as an emergency, and call 911. If the threat is real, maybe they get help. If they\u2019re being a manipulative AH, they learn a valuable (and expensive) lesson about consequences."]}
