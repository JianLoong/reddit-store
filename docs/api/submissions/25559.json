I put my meds in one of those weekly cases and take them daily, the pill bottle with remaining pills is on my dresser in my bedroom.  Last week, after not seeing my husband for several days, due to working, he mentioned to me that he's been taking my extra meds (Adderall for those wondering). I told him those weren't extra and after looking in the bottle told him that now I didn't have enough to get me through the rest of the month. I usually only take the adderal on days I'm working, because that's when I need to be focused (hence the extra sometimes), but I've been working a ton of overtime lately to catch up on bills. \n\nSo the following week, I'm back to working a ton of hours and barely being home. I go to fill my weekly med pack and the bottle of adderal is empty. I wake my husband to ask what happened. He replies that he finished them. I get upset and start yelling at him. He apologizes and says that he thought it would be ok, since I could take these (handing me my step son's medication). I am furious and explain to him that 1) I am not stealing my sons meds and 2) his meds are a different strength and long acting whereas mine are immediate release. (I do want to mention that my son just left for boot camp and won't be home for several months therefor doesnt \"need\" these). \n\nToday happens to be our anniversary and my husband is saying that I shouldn't be mad at him, he's sorry, blah blah blah.

Then you need some place to lock up your medication and your sons since your husband can\u2019t be trusted. He needs to start talking to someone and getting his own medication. Also threatening suicide against you to get his way is grounds for you to file for divorce. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be treated this way.", "He needs to be on a 72 hour hold and you need to dump this thieving addict", "NTA, but is this really the life you envisioned for yourself? Your husband has problems far beyond your wheelhouse to assist with. He needs rehab and therapy and if he refuses both you need to make plans for your own therapy (if you aren't already getting it) and extricate yourself from this relationship. If he threatens suicide call the emergency line.", "Call an ambulance because he has indicated that he is a danger to himself. I think that\u2019s what you are supposed to do if someone threatens suicide.", "NTA. His choices are either going to rehab or being reported to the police for stealing your meds which will result in his arrest. You know he\u2019s been taking your meds for awhile & also probably taking your son\u2019s meds too, right? This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIs your license in jeopardy if you don\u2019t report him to the police?", "If he's diverting your controlled ADHD stimulant medication and has no clinical indication for this medication, he's likely already tipped the scales into substance induced mania/psychosis. Call 911 and get him petitioned.", "Once a druggie, always a druggie.", "NTA but get a lockbox for the meds. And tell him that threatening suicide is manipulative as fuck and to drop that shit.", "NTA. Call the cops if he threatens suicide. Even in marriage vows, no one says you have to stick with your partner through them trying to manipulate you with threats of violence.", "The kind that sells them. Know someone who got his child diagnosed so he can get Adderall but refuses to let his son take medicines like that so he does them instead and sells them \ud83d\ude44\nFunny enough he's a \"Mormon\"", "A friends an ex did this so I called the police and told them. He never threatened it to her again. He\u2019s still alive 15 years later", "This is the way to go. If someone threatened suicide in my presence, I would take them at their word, treat it as an emergency, and call 911. If the threat is real, maybe they get help. If they\u2019re being a manipulative AH, they learn a valuable (and expensive) lesson about consequences.", "Holy shit, OP! You are definitely NTA! I had this happen in a relationship with a guy who I didn\u2019t understand at the time was love bombing the ever loving fuck out of me. He did it with my narcotic pain medication and mine and my daughters\u2019 Adderall. \n\nAt the time, we had just moved in together and I had full custody of my twin girls and he had full custody of his 15 year old daughter who, also at the time, was describing symptoms of pretty serious depression and anxiety to me, and I was working on getting her seen by healthcare professionals and a therapist. \n\nBecause of the meds I had possession of and my concern about his daughter being able to access my narcotic pain meds while which I was afraid could be easily used to hurt herself, I kept all of these medications in a safe at the top of our bedroom closet. He had the combination because at that point, I had not seen a reason to distrust him. And he also expressed to me that he had no reason or desire whatsoever to take pain meds or stimulants. \n\nOne month, just a few days after I got my pain and our ADHD meds refilled, I went into the safe to get out the amount I needed for the day and to get my girls\u2019 and my Adderall for the day. I noticed that all four bottles that had all been refilled the same day suddenly looked way empty. So I took them out and subtly stuffed them in my purse and counted them in my car at work. They all had a fuck ton missing. \n\nI confronted him. He totally denied having taken any of the stimulants but said he\u2019d \u201ctaken a few Percocet\u201d to keep just in case he needed them. And then I found out he\u2019d stuck them into a bottle of Excedrin (which his daughter routinely took for migraines) and left them on top of his dresser. I was *furious* because it completely defeated the purpose of keeping them safe in the safe and even put his daughter in particular in danger of accidentally taking a huge dose of narcotic pain medication. I got most of them back and I\u2019m sure the story about that was BS anyway. \n\nI never found the Adderall and given that he refused to take a drug test to prove he hadn\u2019t had any (I was just bluffing anyway and figured he\u2019d refuse), I know he took them. He very shortly thereafter began taking the Xanax the vet prescribed his anxious dog and drinking heavily. Despite my initial reaction, I pretty quickly cooled down and was ready and willing to forgive and forget. His dad was dying of pancreatic cancer and I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that it was all just grief in action. \n\nHowever, he did a total 180 after that despite my willingness to forgive him and help him cope with his dying dad. In retrospect, I later began to understand it as his mask having slipped and me getting a glimpse into who he really was. He began hacking into my personal and work email accounts and my social media messages and accusing me of inappropriate behavior with my completely platonic male friends he\u2019d always known about my friendships with and already known about conversations I had with them because he was literally sitting right beside me as I read and sent them because I wanted him to feel comfortable.\n\nI later learned that after I left him, he went immediately back to a girl who he claimed he\u2019d been FWB with but cut her off weeks before we started dating and he talked mad shit about her as a mom and person. I doubt they ever quit seeing each other while we dated and now understand his accusations as projections of a guilty conscience. They\u2019re now married and the last time we spoke, I threatened to send her the screenshots of the way he talked about her and her son and minutes later, I couldn\u2019t see her Facebook profile anymore so he obviously blocked me from her account before I had the chance! \ud83e\udd23\n\nHe threatened to unalive himself if I left him but I finally did and despite me having loads of evidence via screenshots and messages that he was the abusive asshole in the relationship, he trashed me for years after that on socials and accused me of having used him which was wild. He knew I wasn\u2019t the type of person to air my dirty laundry in public. \n\nIf I had it to do over again, I\u2019d probably expose him but I still stand by the knowledge that anyone who knows me well enough would never believe I\u2019d do the things he accused me of, and while a handful of people I knew believed him, even members of his own family and friends who\u2019d known him way longer are still friendly with me and reached out to say that they understood why I left. \n\nHis own sister and BIL are to this day my Facebook friends and even before we broke up, she told me that she loved me and hoped I\u2019d be around for good but doubted her brother would treat me well enough to keep me. I should\u2019ve known then I was in for trouble! \n\nThis got way longer than I intended for it to be, but I just wanted to say that I can relate and in my case this was the impetus for our relationship imploding and what helped me realize he\u2019s probably the only true narcissist I\u2019ve ever been in a relationship with despite having had lots of experiences with assholes when I was younger and dumber. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened. You are so very much *not the asshole* and you need to protect yourself and your (and your son\u2019s meds). Get a safe he doesn\u2019t know the code to, bolt it down, and set up a camera in front of it. He\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2019s an addict who absolutely cannot be trusted or given the opportunity to steal your meds and will continue to do it unless you prevent him from being able to do so. \n\nDon\u2019t let him gaslight you into believing that he\u2019s actually gonna unalive himself because of the consequences of his addictive actions or emotionally manipulate you otherwise. The fact that you\u2019re even a little concerned you could ever possibly be the asshole in this scenario is a product of his manipulation.", "Hubby is in deep shit.\n\nNTA but you need to do more than pouting. \n\nYou should report your CONTROLLED PRESCRIBTION meds stolen. You may have to, to get a refill. Your husband has a drug problem and you cannot cover for him or enable it. Lock the meds away or keep them off site, like in your car with no car ley acess to him. \n\nAlso call the cops for a wellfare check every time hubby threatens suicide. It's pure manipulation. Addicts will do anything to keep their train going. \n\nDo not allow him to guilt you into 'helping' him. He will use anything to not take responsiblility: You weren't particularly nice to him? He will blame you for his addiction or lack of progress. You argue with him? It's your fault that he relapsed because you stressed him out. He never attemps to abstain or seeks treatment? Of course that's because you XYZ...\n\nYou may have to disengage personally and spacially to protect yourself and remove one way of him making excuses. \n\nLook into support for addicts family members.", "OP, You need to wake up!  You have been living with an alcoholic/addict for many years.  Multiple DUI's, losing his driver's license for several years, and now stealing scheduled 2 narcotics from you and your son?????????  Now he's refusing to go to rehab and says he's going to kill himself.  Stop enabling him!\nEither he goes to rehab NOW or you call the police and tell them he's threatening suicide.  Rehab, psych ward, or the street.  Only choices.  Stop playing his games and stop asking Reddit for answer's.", "NTA if he's threatening suicide then you need to get him admitted to a hospital. It honestly sounds he has a problem and is manipulating you but either way he needs professional help beyond you.", "NTA\n\nCall the emergency line. Say that your husband is having a mental health crisis, that he\u2019s been stealing your medication and is now threatening suicide. \n\nMost hospitals will keep someone at least overnight and get them assessed. \n\nThreatening suicide as a manipulation tactic is abuse btw. Always follow through when someone makes this threat - call 911. If they\u2019re serious with the threat it could save their life. If they aren\u2019t serious with the threat then they will be pissed off and won\u2019t make that threat again if they know it\u2019s going to get them carter off to the hospital.", "NTA. That's a FEDERAL crime. Go report his ass to police and hope he gets sober. He's a selfish addict and deserves what's coming to him.  If he's threatening suicide put him on a 5150 and start his rehab right away in the psych ward.\n\nEdit: this nonsense has been going on for 2 years? Girl, leave.  He's a scrub. Move on.", "INFO: Just saw your previous post. Does your husband still have a drinking problem? It\u2019s possible he\u2019s drinking AND taking your meds at the same time. That sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nNTA. But looks like you\u2019d have to seriously think of how you\u2019ll move forward with your relationship with your (STBX) husband.", "NTA. If someone threatens suicide, they need to be hospitalized to get the treatment they need. Even if you think it is an empty threat, you want to be careful.", "If he isn't willing to help himself and is laying it all on you then he needs to go stay with other family members. You can't take all of this on. Get a lockbox for any medication you have in the meantime and stop storing it in the open.  \n\n\nIt's time to decide if he's worth staying with in his present state as there is no guarantee he will ever get better.

As someone who has problems with suicidal ideation, I would never use my mental health to bully people in to putting up with me blatantly stealing from them and keep them from getting me help.

He just doesn't gaf about OP or the child.", "If this guy is threatening suicide, then she needs to call the cops\u2019 nonemergency line and ask what to do.

And her husband can get the help he needs if he is, indeed, suicidal.", "That never even occurred to me", "This is the way.", "I have never once regretted it. At the time my friend was worried that he would unalive himself but knew he\u2019d be angry if she called the police. So I was the bad guy and did it, she told me a few years later that me calling is what really started to show her just how manipulative he could be. \n\nHe spent 48ish hours in a hold before he was let go. I\u2019m sure he learned a lesson."]}
