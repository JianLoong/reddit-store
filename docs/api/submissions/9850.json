Do you grandparents know the way she is treating you and screaming at you? Go live with them if you still have the chance.", "Nta ur body ur choice go and live with ur grandparents their 100% better than her", "Your hair, your choice.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \nYou're old enough to make that decision yourself. Mom sounds like a controlling AH. \nHair grows back regardless. Cut her out of your life ASAP", "INFO: Is not cutting your hair a part of your religious beliefs? Because, for example, in Sikhism, you actually aren't supposed to cut your hair, so could that be a factor?\n\nNot that she can force it on you, but just want to know the entire information.", "NTA- she doesn't own your body.", "NTA.

I have super thick hair, and it grows fast and is very, very strong.  A few years ago, I decided I wanted to see how long my hair would grow.  I got to just past mid-calf, but after the third time I tweaked my neck by standing on my hair when getting up from a seat, I decided it wasn\u2019t worth the injury risk. I have proprioception issues, so it\u2019s hard for me to keep precise track of where my limbs are, and I can\u2019t bun my hair all the time without headaches, so I knew I was going to keep doing that, and it\u2019d probably get worse as it got even longer.", "Well, I can certainly understand that, and while I have seen alot of Sikh girls who now cut there hair, I have also met tons, who follow their religious beliefs vigorously and don't cut their hair, and they have gorgeous hair, some as you said, have hair till their calves. But they also maintain there hair properly with oiling and braiding, which results in very thick and beautiful strong hair.", "NTA for sure but I do want a crumb more context. Never ever cutting your hair isn't the norm in most cultures and its not like teenagers getting haircuts is a new thing - I feel like there's definitely more to this story.", " NTA"]}
