You were being honest regarding your experience and perspective. You acknowledged the stress they were under and how it made it hard for them. \n\nI suspect you burst a bubble for your mom.

You can\u2019t help having a disabled sister, she can\u2019t help that she is disabled, god knows your parents wish things were different. With that said, it sounds like they tried the best that they could to give you guys vacations and do these trips hoping to give you guys normal family experiences as much as they could, yes even tho they were really hard to accomplish with your sister\u2019s disability. For a Mom to hear that she failed so miserably to one of her kids with all her efforts\u2026 I\u2019m sure you broke her heart! One day you might be a parent and understand.
