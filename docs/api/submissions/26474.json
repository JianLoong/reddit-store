You were being honest regarding your experience and perspective. You acknowledged the stress they were under and how it made it hard for them. \n\nI suspect you burst a bubble for your mom. She probably thought it was all worth the stress she went through because you and your other sibling came away with great vacation memories. Now she doesn\u2019t even have that to hold onto.", "NTA \n\nYou have your truth and you are allowed to own it.  The fact that they want you to hide your truth to fit their fairy-tale makes them the AH. \n\nSorry, OP! You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s understandable that they\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s the reality. You don\u2019t owe an apology. You appreciate their effort, but it was awful.", "NTA. Not a similar situation, but I can relate: your parents tried to keep up a facsimile of a \"Kodak happy family\" by doing \"the things they're supposed to\" and neglecting their kids in the process, then want to get resentful that their misplaced efforts don't make up for mistreatment.", "NTA", "NTA> Question asked and answered.", "YTA\u2026 not because you agreed with your Mom that they were hard\u2026 but you went for the throat and basically said they were so horrible to you.. you wish they never made you go on them. You can\u2019t help having a disabled sister, she can\u2019t help that she is disabled, god knows your parents wish things were different. With that said, it sounds like they tried the best that they could to give you guys vacations and do these trips hoping to give you guys normal family experiences as much as they could, yes even tho they were really hard to accomplish with your sister\u2019s disability. For a Mom to hear that she failed so miserably to one of her kids with all her efforts\u2026 I\u2019m sure you broke her heart! One day you might be a parent and understand.

Likely this was a set up for how, when they pass, you should take up the mantle because of all the effort they've provided before, and take care of your disabled sister.  Apparently you've derailed that plan.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour feelings are perfectly valid. You did nothing wrong. Your parents have a martyr complex and you're not obligated to play along. Please do not apologize to your mother. She is totally in the wrong.", "It wasn't, and my parents acted like I was crazy for not enjoying these \"vacations\"", "Well, they must be in delulu land or not remembering the vacations truthfully.\n\nMostly, I think your mother was hoping that her and your father hid their arguments better from you as a child. They also likely don't want a reminder that you took on a lot as a child.", "Which is fucking mental, as *they obviously didn't either*. Sheesh.\n\nNTA, OP. And not crazy, either.", "NTA\n\n\"Most kids don't get a vacation home.\"\n\nYeah well most kids get a normal childhood, but that wasn't on the menu dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for the childhood you and your youngest sib were robbed of. I\u2019m a special educator for students with significant behavior needs, I know that car scenario well. \n\nThis is a common dynamic in homes with a special needs sibling, alas. You said nothing you need to apologize for. Parenting your sis was rough, but your parents neglected your needs, and your safety. You spoke your truth. \n\nYou need a firm boundary with mom and dad. \u201cMy childhood was not fun. I was scared a lot of the time, and ignored. I am not grateful for those vacations, they were not enjoyable at all.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d take a break from them for a few weeks at least.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu called out your mom for a shitty childhood. It's true, so you are not the AH", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are full of it. Your youth sounds dreadful, and at least at home you were behind a locked door in your room.\n\nA family vacation when some of the family is dangerous is not good at all, so there's nothing to be grateful for.\n\nYour father is self-righteous and huffy. Don't apologize. Demands for apologies ae the acts of a bully.", "Nta I don't believe for a second that your parents didn't realize that your sister used to hit you and mistreat you. It's fine that she's upset and it is fine that this hurts her feelings. It is not fine to lash out at you. You were perfectly polite and empathetic but I don't think you have to beat around the bush or lie to her about your own experiences. \n\nWhen my mom insists on revising my childhood a common phrase I say is \"mom we don't have to fight about this and it doesn't have to be an issue but I will not sit here and accept your lies\" and if she won't stop I very nicely give her a hug goodbye and leave.  I think neglectful/abusive parents often pretend not to remember the crappy things they did. My go to for that is \"it doesn't matter if you don't remember, I remember and that's what counts\".", "NTA, but I can really see both perspectives here. We have a son who is prone to meltdowns and we try so, so hard to give his siblings a normal childhood and to find ways that everyone, including us parents,  can relax and enjoy ourselves - and when it doesn\u2019t work, all our hard work and preparations are for nothing, it\u2019s just devastating. Parenting a special needs child can be relentlessly difficult sometimes and I can really see how your mom might have needed that break - or at least, the fantasy of it, to keep her going. You could have expressed yourself with a bit more empathy.", "You're NTA. Your parents must have been completely oblivious and/or in absolute denial if they really thought you had any reason to enjoy those vacations. Were they even paying the slightest bit of attention to what was going on the back of the van and in the house?", "NTA.", "NTA a vacation house means nothing if you\u2019re constantly miserable there. Might as well be miserable at home. Like you said, at least at home your room has a lock to keep your sister out. Hold your ground and don\u2019t apologize, they\u2019re just mad that you aren\u2019t holding up their delusions.", "OP absolutely burst her bubble. Now she needs to come to terms with the fact that her desire to create \u201chappy\u201d vacation memories resulted in the exact opposite. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow to know your attempts to be good to your children actively harmed them.", "Hard disagree. Her mother displays zero empathy towards her. So often the \u201ceasy\u201d siblings are neglected. They had to remove their seatbelts due to aggression from their sister. The only way she felt safe was to lock her bedroom door. That is abuse and too often special needs parents will throw their other children under the bus. I\u2019m a sped teacher I adore my students but more than once I\u2019ve advocated for a residential placement because the violence is out of control. The parents come to accept it as normal, and it IS NOT. If a child is unsafe in the home, the empathy should be FOR THE CHILD BEING ATTACKED. \n\nThe fact is that her parents failed her and her other sibling.", "Boohoo and go somewhere else. The mom\u2019s happiness is not OP\u2019s responsibility and she has the right to give her mother an honest account of these vacations from her point of view. If the mom is too weak to accept that, apologize, and move on that\u2019s her problem.", "I think that your mom was saying that the vacations were hard FOR HER, and had never thought about how hard it was for you. She was expecting you to talk about how much you loved those sacrifices that she made and had wonderful memories of these trips. \n\nShe never even thought of what the actual experience was for you. She wasn't looking for you to commiserate and agree it was hard for all of you, she was looking for praise for selflessly shouldering that burden FOR you.\n\nIt's absolutely crazy how tone deaf some parents are to how their behavior actually affected their children.  My mom is the same way and it's mind boggling how she truly believes that certain things were such amazing things for us kids, bit it was actually completely miserable for us and benefitted no one but her.", "They\u2019re allowed to feel hurt- they probably thought \u201cwell at least we had the vacation home\u201d but they\u2019ve chosen not to think about the cost that came with that. \n\nThey don\u2019t get to act like you wronged them", "Hide sight being 20:20, had the parents set aside days to have 1-on-1 time with the kids would have probably been far cheaper, less stressful, more memorable, and mentally good for all involved. \n\nI think 1-on-1 time with kids is so important, especially if there\u2019s a special needs sibling who tends to get far more of the parents\u2019 time and attention daily. The other kids need to know that they aren\u2019t an after thought just because they don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d the parents as much.", "Wow! Mommy and Daddy issues?!?  Don\u2019t broadcast your issues \u2026 obviously 20 something issues on hurting someone else\u2019s feelings. MOST moms give the best that they can to do the best that they can..
