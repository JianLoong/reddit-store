Take time & sort your own thinking, but at some point before being married, you owe her honesty so she too can make fully informed decision.", "YTA if you don't tell your significant other. The vast majority of AITA situations could have been avoided completely by having an adult conversation. They aren't easy,but head in the sand and lying, even by omission, doesn't solve anything.", "I'm leaning towards YWBTA for not telling her you're seeking therapy solely on the basis of this might come back to bite you in terms of keeping secrets.\n\nOn the other hand  you don't have to tell her what's its about. If your partner respects boundaries a simple \"theres some things that seem to be troubling me from my childhood that im seeking help for. If i need some kind of support from you ill let you know\" should suffice", "Why are you with somebody that you speak about like this? Why are you trying to marry somebody who you\u2019re not honest with?", "YTA. How can you consider marrying someone but you won\u2019t talk with them or even acknowledge you have deep issues and are seeking help for it?", "NAH. The content of your therapy is no one's business but your own. I would say that just the fact of your seeing a therapist shouldn't be kept secret to someone you plan to marry your life to, but I'm really concerned about this description you give of the reaction you anticipate from your fiance - that you would have to console her (and everything else you list) is ridiculous. Your therapy isn't about her. \n\nI'd say talk it over in therapy. Figure out there if and how you should share any information.", "Light YTA \n\nI'd just let her know what you're doing and tell her things have gotten a bit much in life and you're going for better ways to cope \n\nThis secret will just weigh on you and if it comes out later your partner will feel hurt that you felt you couldn't tell her", "You don't have to tell her from the get go, but you'll have to tell her eventually. One option is to go to a session and spend that time consulting THIS problem with the therapist and THEN make a more informed decision. We are only strangers on the internet after all.\n\nYou guys are planning to get married, you should have that kind of relationship where you can tell her if you need help. It is only fair she knows what's going on with you. On the other hand it's on you how much are you willing to share and what pace. There are no black and white answers to this.\n\nNAH", "NTA \n\nWe never know the inner private lives of others. It\u2019s only really what is in our nature to reveal. I can understand why you haven\u2019t told her about exactly how you are feeling or are affected by things. In my case, there aren\u2019t always the words for these things.\n\nTherapy is private, but you have to tell her. And you have to tell her that you want privacy around it. Therapy can cause disturbance while you process things - and I think explaining how you need support will be really important for both of you. You don\u2019t have to tell her you want to talk about your relationship. Perhaps request that she not ask you about the sessions, but that you will talk to her about them if you need to.", "You are not the asshole for not wanting to tell your wife everything about your issues, especially when you are trying to make sense of them yourself. And of course not an asshole for admitting you need professional help. \n\nThe therapist is there to help you make sense of what is going on in your mind and she/he/they will also help you share with your wife when you are ready. That is why you are paying a professional, so you don\u00b4t just dump all this on your wife and end up with the questions, panic etc\n\nYour wife is not an asshole either, you don\u00b4t really know what her reaction would be so you can\u00b4t call her the asshole.\n\nNAH", ">Been together 8 years now and we\u2019re doing well in 90% of our life together but I feel that other 10% is something I need help with.\n\nNTA if you don't tell her.\n\nBut that 10% clearly includes some pretty problematic behaviour, given your expected responses from her if she knows you are getting therapy and if she learns about your childhood issues. \n\nI can't understand why she would need to be consoled because you are getting to help you cope with feeling overwhelmed and dealing with personal issues?\n\nPerhaps this is something you could also discuss in your therapy?", "NTA. You should tell her. But on your own time. I applaud you for recognizing you need help and a therapist is someone to help you digest and pick apart some of the issues you have in your life.", "YTA.\n\nDon\u2019t get married to someone you don\u2019t have any interest in being honest with about your mental health.", "The fact that you feel you can't tell your fiancee about your therapy, and the reasons you feel you can't tell her, really make me worry about the health of your relationship, her sensitivity to your needs, and your ability to tell her directly what you need.\n\nI want to suggest that in addition to you personal therapy, you consider going into couples therapy before you marry.  It sounds that the 10 percent of the relationship that isn't wonderful could sink the whole shebang if some of the issues not wanting to reveal that you're going to therapy suggest aren't addressed.\n\nNTA, as whatever you have to do (including making it secret) to get yourself into therapy is completely OK, but please please look at what's going on between you and your fiancee more deeply.", "I will preface this by saying NTA.\n\nIt is fantastic that you are seeking the appropriate supports that will allow you to have the resources and knowledge to manage your issues. Personally, you should consider starting with the therapist and exploring all your options with them. Explain your issues and how this impacts on your relationship. Once you have a workable plan, then might be the time to gradually bring your fianc\u00e9 into the loop. Right now, you don\u2019t seem ready to do so; and that is absolutely okay.\n\nFocus on you first and foremost. Then when you feel more comfortable, consider opening up more to your fianc\u00e9. But do it at your pace. \n\nTherapy isn\u2019t something fianc\u00e9 HAS to know about, it is something she probably NEEDS to know about if you plan to get married.", "THis sounds like you should discuss ending the relationship with your therapist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Simple, why you're going to therapy is your business but tell them you're going to therapy.", "YTA but gently.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to tell her every single detail of why you\u2019re going to see a therapist but you *do* need to tell her you\u2019re going to therapy.

I believe we dont need to share 100% with our partners and there are some parts that we can have for ourselves. However you cannot hide major things. Also if you are exhausted at the possibility of explaining this to your partner, How will you explain it to her in future when she finds out that you were seeking professional help without telling her? That would be even more exhausting than the alternative. \nIt would have been understandable if you didnt want to tell her now since you don't want to affect her work at a vital time, But it seems like you dont want to tell her completely. \n\nHow would you feel if the situation was reversed and she seeked professional help without the intention of telling you?", "As someone who is in therapy to tackle childhood trauma, YTA. Childhood traumas are no joke. Your fiance\u00e9 deserves to make an informed decision about who she is marrying. YWBTA to begin your marriage with dishonesty and lies - not a great start.", "Exactly that", "Agree. He shouldn't be marrying (or even in a serious relationship with someone) that he feels like he can't communicate/be honest with.", "Op is hiding something. Absolutely YTA.", "A bit more context is needed here maybe. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked about everything in our lives from the very beginning so we both know our pasts. \nSome things from my childhood have impacted me more than I\u2019ve let on so things can be left to (hopefully) just die but it seems that hasn\u2019t happened. \nI\u2019ll edit the post to cover this.", "So, you\u2019re keeping secrets. Definitely YTA.  Your fianc\u00e9e (female spelling) deserves to know what she is getting into.
