I had a friend message me a couple weeks after finding out asking if they could also join.  I explained to them that, since was my pup's first hiking/camping trip, I didn't know how it would go and that the planning on what we were doing and when we'd return was really based on his behavior during the trip - which they acknowledged and agreed to at the time. Since live in another province and dont drive, they planned to fly out where I would pick them up and we'd use a single car.\n\nFlash forward to present where we left on Thursday morning to arrive at the campsite (about an hour away). We had a great first day, hitting some easy trails and getting in ~12km of hiking. The next day, we kicked it up a little bit and did another 15km of easy/moderate trails - at which point my friend was getting irritated because there were no \"views\" (lots of beautiful sights, but we never got up to a peak to see a nice 360). \n\nThat night, I noticed my pup was limping a bit on one of his hind legs. I did a check to make sure nothing was stuck in his paw, and resolved it must be a bit crampy after the day of trails (he's ~1 year old, 85 lbs, and we do >10km walks regularly, so I wasn't concerned about him not being fit enough for what we had done). In the morning, the limp was still there and he seemed reluctant to walk more than a block when I took him for a pee. After thinking about it for a couple hours, while I waited for my friend to get up, I decided it was best not to push him and call the trip there.\n\nAs expected by the fact I'm posting here, my friend was disappointed and angry at me for calling the trip a day early.

It was your trip to begin with. The friend invited themselves, then gets upset when you did exactly what you said you\u2019d do: observe the pup and do more or less depending on pup\u2019s behavior. The friend is being unreasonable.", "NTA, because you told them it was all contingent on how the dog felt. \n\nI suppose since the dog's issue wasn't an emergency, you could've stayed and your friend could've gone on a hike on their own? Of course the incident's now over, but that was another way of handling it.", "YTA, you need to ease your pet into hiking. You over did it and injured your dog.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
