You are also \"unable\" to help her this semester.\n\nDon't contact her until you have the cash in hand to pay her back.  I would think that moving across country for a job should have come with a really good pay raise.\n\nSheesh", "YTA. Sorry, but forgetting to pay her back is assholery. And you know what? Even if you disagree that forgetting to repay your debt to your own family crosses the asshole line, you're still an asshole. Why? Because you think your daughters short response of \"sure\" was wrong on her part. Buddy, that was the POLITEST response you could have gotten.\n\n\n\nAre parents obligated to help their children with tuition? No. But you *committed to helping them* and then renegged on one of your kids, AND THEN FORGOT THE DEBT, which shows a lack of respect for your daughter on your part. For all your daughter can estimate, you are simply renegging on both your debt and your commitment to help her with college. That makes you an asshole.\n\n\n\n\nYour daughter thus far has been incredibly forgiving. This is not chump change we are talking about here. Even if shes been working and saving since she was a teenager, you think that makes it ok to go back on your word to your child? Listen, I can forgive (and I think your daughter could too) you not having the money at the time to help both kids. What makes you an *absolute* asshole is literally everything that came AFTER that.\n\n\n\nIve been the sibling the parents do not financially help when I needed it. Ive been the sibling the parents dont get a large gift for when everyone else got a large gift. It fucking sucks. From your perspective, you think \"well Im GOING to pay her back. Why doesnt she trust me?\" But from her perspective, its closer to \"Why did my parents choose to help only my brother and then lie to me about paying me back?\" Because so far, thats what you've done. Youve lied.\n\n\n\nFYI, if you cant repay the money, the correct thing to do is to periodically (once a month or however long your daughter would like you to) send a text acknowledging you havent forgotten the debt, but things havent changed this period and you still cant repay her. Then apologize and say you cant help in the future either (because sounds like you cant)", "YTA\n\nYou told her you would pay her back and you didn't.  Its really that simple. \n\nLife happens.  If you and your husband are going through a financial hardship and can no longer pay tuition for your kids, you need to communicate that.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your daughter's responsibility to remind you to pay your debt to her. It's your responsibility to pay it. You just made it clear that she is your absolute last priority.

With her whole 3 years of work history? Bet you've been working at least 7 times as long, so why is it an issue for you? \n\nGet off your ass and get a side hustle or 2nd job until that debt is paid. Eat rice and beans and sell your jewelry. As a mother myself, I am appalled at your disregard for your promise to your child.\n\nAnd if you absolutely can't do that?

Middle child and only introvert in a family of extroverts here. My birthday is near Christmas.

I don\u2019t think your daughter is upset that moving forward you won\u2019t be paying for her tuition because of unexpected financial difficulty, but rather because not only did you have her pay for her own tuition after saying you would do it, but you paid for your son\u2019s semester in full without contributing anything to her\u2026you should have split what you did have between your daughter and son. Paying only for your son\u2019s semester is extremely unfair and I can only imagine how your daughter must feel. I know how she feels because my family did and continues to do similar things with me and my sister. And I don\u2019t talk to them anymore, so don\u2019t be surprised if this is just the beginning. \n\nFurthermore, you failed to communicate to BOTH your children that you, in fact, will NOT be paying for their tuition. You\u2019re completely blindsiding them and not giving them the chance to fully prepare. Sure, your daughter might have some savings, but it still isn\u2019t fair to have her pay for something that you said you would, tell her you\u2019ll pay her back, and then just back out of EVERYTHING. Like, holy shit. That is A LOT. And now, you won\u2019t be paying for any of her tuition for the foreseeable future either. All of this time, she could have been preparing, but instead, you gave her no chance. Also, why in the world are you waiting for your kids to ask you about this huge financial responsibility instead of telling them from the get go that you won\u2019t be able to help?? Why are you letting them believe that they\u2019ll have your help, when in reality, they won\u2019t? I understand hoping that things will get better and that you actually WILL be able to help them, but surely you could have given them more time and not waited for them to ask you. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better for them to expect to pay for it on their own and make arrangements with time? And then, when the time comes, if you WERE able to help, it would have been a nice, unexpected, but welcome relief. \n\nYou screwed both of your kids over with your failure to communicate and prepare them, but your daughter suffered the brunt of it. Not only financially, but emotionally. By paying for your son\u2019s semester in full, but not hers, even if unintentionally, what you did was let her know that your son\u2019s studies are more important than hers. That *your son himself* is more important. Regardless if those were your intentions or how you actually feel, that is what you made her feel and coming back from that won\u2019t be easy. Especially if history has supported this.\n\nYTA. Find a way to make it up to your daughter, know that it won\u2019t be easy, and keep trying to make it up to her. If you care about her and the situation that is. I can\u2019t blame her though. My whole life, everyone in my family (namely my grandmother) had always helped my older sister and left me to fend for myself. There were times where I had nowhere to sleep, literally, while my sister stayed with my grandmother and slept on her bed and mine (pushed together to make a big bed) while I slept in my car. I don\u2019t talk to them anymore the same way that your daughter will stop talking to you and I can\u2019t say that I blame her. The least you could do, besides paying her back when you can and trying to make up for everything, is continue to try and make things better financially and emotionally. It won\u2019t be easy.", "YTA because you don't know how to accept the blame for something you did.

It\u2019s the failure to talk that is the AH move.\n\nAll it takes is \u201clook I\u2019m very sorry daughter but you know what has happened with our jobs and so forth and with all the upheaval we don\u2019t have the money right now. Do you have the means in the short term to keep up your classes? Let\u2019s make a plan. And as soon as things are straightened out we will start paying that money back to you. Thank you for understanding in the meantime, let me know if you\u2019re struggling.\u201d", "I\u2019ve often been in the position where I couldn\u2019t count on my parents financially. Hell, I\u2019ve even paid for the mortgage a few times while in high school. I\u2019ve been homeless, I\u2019ve gone weeks with only eating food the school provides, I\u2019ve had to use all of my money to take care of my drug addict father and disabled mother. I\u2019ve had to work and put all my money in my father\u2019s commissary when in jail, paid for his lawyer, all while trying to keep up with mortgage payments at the ripe age of 18. You make opinions and assumptions sound like facts and IT SHOWS. Not everyone was served food on a silver platter. Not everyone had parents who actually took care of them or cared for their children in any way instead of the other way around and to assume as much is incredibly ignorant.\n\nOP messed up was by paying for the son\u2019s tuition in full instead of splitting that money between the two of them. That, straight up, isn\u2019t fair. Maybe they didn\u2019t know that they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for the daughter\u2019s tuition that semester, but when they realized that, they should have had the son take half of his tuition money and give it to his sister so that they would each be paying for half of that semester. If the daughter had the money to pay for her semester in full, then the son should have had the money to pay for half.\n\nThe other mistake that OP made was letting their kids believe that they would be paying for their tuition when they weren\u2019t sure that they actually could. Instead of telling them that that was the last semester that THEY KNOW FOR A FACT that they could help with, they ASSUMED that they would be financially stable by next semester and able to pay for their tuition. They gave them a false sense of security. They should have told them that due to their financial situation, each kid would have to make arrangements and start preparing for next semester IN THE EVENT that they won\u2019t be able to pay for their tuition. Yes, they said that they were having financial difficulties, but they still let them believe that their tuition would be covered. And to top things off, they WAITED for their kids to ask them what was going on. Instead of telling their kids right away, instead of giving their kids time to make plans, they waited until the last minute, leaving the kids to scramble for solutions. Should the kids have had a plan and solution made despite depending on their parents? Sure. That\u2019s the responsible thing to do, but are you really going to blame them for not having anything ready because they chose to BELIEVE THEIR PARENTS when they said that it would be covered?? Yes, shame on those kids for thinking their parents would keep their word despite the parents knowing their financial predicament!\n\nShit happens. No one is denying that, but the way OP handled the situation was wrong. They needed to have communicated with their kids to better prepare them. Instead, they stiffed one kid and showed favoritism. Part of being in \u201csurvival mode\u201d means taking care of your kids and communicating to them that they will no longer be able to help them financially. Not waiting for their kids to ask what\u2019s going on, but giving them ample time to seek another solution.", "Isn't this what the savings accounts the parents have paid into since birth is for?\n\nOh wait. There's no financial planning here. \n\nI wonder if OP and her husband have older cars or if they're financed to the hilt on new cars?\n\nThey really should sit down and work out their finances properly instead of this money in = money out attitude that has now failed them.", "Step down off your high horse. OP literally came here, a sub dedicated to strangers analyzing and making judgements on whatever limited info a person provides, to be judged. \n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s not having the money this go and then there\u2019s somehow \u201cforgetting\u201d they owe someone $2500 bucks. Total asshole move to not pay it back and then act like the victim when her daughter gets pissed off. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just based on the info OP gave.

My dad set up a trust fund for me and my sister and paid in like \u00a3100 a month or smth like that until we turned 18, and then we got the passcode to it on our birthday. So something like that would\u2019ve been better to ensure that you had enough money for both.", "With the repeated mentions of \"she has savings, she can afford it\", it sounds to me more like you were hoping *she* would 'forget', i.e. that she wouldn't hold you to your promise and you would never have to pay.\n\nNo way you genuinely didn't remember you owed your daughter.

Why on earth did you think it was okay to not communicate with your daughter about this? You\u2019re very cavalier about not paying your daughter back. I\u2019d be pissed! You\u2019re acting like she was an afterthought (if even a thought at all). Even if you can\u2019t pay her back all at once you should make SOME type of attempt even if it\u2019s just a monthly payment of $150 until you pay her back what you owe her!", "Then why promise them to pay their tuition?

Another parent who takes for granted the responsible child.  Another parent who makes bullsh\\*t promises and doesn't keep them. Another parent who thinks that they can get away with making bullsh\\*t promises without repercussions. \n\nWell, most likely OP's daughter's trust and respect just went down a notch or two. No doubt, she has experienced this kind of bullsh\\*t before from her parent because sh\\*t like this from a parent isn't a one off- pay for the son's needs but screw the daughter. Parent- \"Oh, son is asking for tuition money that I promised okay, no problem. But I'll just use the money I promised daughter because after all she has got a lot saved. Of course, she did work hard for that money throughout high school but still I promised to help. Ah, f\\*ck her, she's a girl and she has her own money.\"\n\nWhy parents think that they can screw over their kids and get away with it is crazy. Sure the parent is probably in the 40s or early 50 and reasonably healthy, and also thinking that those kids still rely on them. They don't think that when they are in their 70s or 80s or they get sick that they will be counting on their kids to come back and wipe their mouths and asses when they can't take care of themselves. Or when the children do really well in life and wonder why they don't want to include their parents in their vacations or have the parents come for a visit since they have a nice big house.  Repercussions of broken promises especially when those promises have an impact on a kid's future.   \n\nI hope this parent does better otherwise she is going to lose her daughter and the parent will certainly deserve it.

They are in debt, and it is entirely possible this debt was accrued at no fault of theirs (e.g. medical). However, their inability to think more than two minutes ahead doesn't speak positively of their ability to escape that debt. \n\nYep, in this current climate, being in debt isn't why the OP is at fault. It's that they keep saying they'll pay for this and that yet don't. Let the kids know and they can prep for loans or whatever.
