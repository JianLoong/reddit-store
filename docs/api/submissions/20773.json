You are also \"unable\" to help her this semester.\n\nDon't contact her until you have the cash in hand to pay her back.  I would think that moving across country for a job should have come with a really good pay raise.\n\nSheesh", "YTA. Sorry, but forgetting to pay her back is assholery. And you know what? Even if you disagree that forgetting to repay your debt to your own family crosses the asshole line, you're still an asshole. Why? Because you think your daughters short response of \"sure\" was wrong on her part. Buddy, that was the POLITEST response you could have gotten.\n\n\n\nAre parents obligated to help their children with tuition? No. But you *committed to helping them* and then renegged on one of your kids, AND THEN FORGOT THE DEBT, which shows a lack of respect for your daughter on your part. For all your daughter can estimate, you are simply renegging on both your debt and your commitment to help her with college. That makes you an asshole.\n\n\n\n\nYour daughter thus far has been incredibly forgiving. This is not chump change we are talking about here. Even if shes been working and saving since she was a teenager, you think that makes it ok to go back on your word to your child? Listen, I can forgive (and I think your daughter could too) you not having the money at the time to help both kids. What makes you an *absolute* asshole is literally everything that came AFTER that.\n\n\n\nIve been the sibling the parents do not financially help when I needed it. Ive been the sibling the parents dont get a large gift for when everyone else got a large gift. It fucking sucks. From your perspective, you think \"well Im GOING to pay her back. Why doesnt she trust me?\" But from her perspective, its closer to \"Why did my parents choose to help only my brother and then lie to me about paying me back?\" Because so far, thats what you've done. Youve lied.\n\n\n\nFYI, if you cant repay the money, the correct thing to do is to periodically (once a month or however long your daughter would like you to) send a text acknowledging you havent forgotten the debt, but things havent changed this period and you still cant repay her. Then apologize and say you cant help in the future either (because sounds like you cant)", "YTA\n\nYou told her you would pay her back and you didn't.  Its really that simple. \n\nLife happens.  If you and your husband are going through a financial hardship and can no longer pay tuition for your kids, you need to communicate that.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your daughter's responsibility to remind you to pay your debt to her. It's your responsibility to pay it. You just made it clear that she is your absolute last priority.

With her whole 3 years of work history? Bet you've been working at least 7 times as long, so why is it an issue for you? \n\nGet off your ass and get a side hustle or 2nd job until that debt is paid. Eat rice and beans and sell your jewelry. As a mother myself, I am appalled at your disregard for your promise to your child.\n\nAnd if you absolutely can't do that?

So she\u2019s dealing with that favouritism as well.\n\n(Also, \u201cI forgot\u201d isn\u2019t the brilliant defence you think it is.

Middle child and only introvert in a family of extroverts here. My birthday is near Christmas.

Which is technically the truth. I learned early that complaining just got me told to \"stop making drama.\" My birthday party is now a 40 person affair with all my aunts and uncles and cousins because everyone's in town for the holiday and I'd rather scream into a paper bag for 3 hours than be around that many people for that long?

Your poor daughter.", "You should have known.", "So by \u2018financial hardship\u2019 do you mean you\u2019ve made a lifetime of crappy financial decisions because you don\u2019t plan ahead?", "And these things plus the debt magically appeared in the 30 days between when your son signed up and you daughter?", "Yuuuuuup.\n\n\n\nI hate that about your graduation gift. I hate even more that I can relate to that specific pain", "Ugh. Early January birthday and it sucks. My mom was a horrible gift giver and having a birthday that close the Christmas compounded it. Honestly I just kind of want to forget it now.", "I have a friend whose birthday is 12/26, and despite having parents, a sister/BIL with 4 kids, a husband and 3 kids of her own, I am the ONLY person who even acknowledges her birthday. It makes me so sad to hear that other people go through this stuff too. Birthdays are YOUR day, and everyone gets Christmas. I don\u2019t care if it means it gets celebrated at the half birthday point\u2026 it deserves celebrating.", "Yeah Ill never forget the thing that made me realize \"oh. My parents love me the *least*. Got it.\" I had spent years going to computer building classes, clubs, camps, stuff like that. I loved computers. I begged my parents every single christmas for a new graphics card. You see, I dont remember what kind mine was, but my computer was actually built out of parts from the dump. I couldnt actually play most games. Hell I could BARELY play Roblox on minimum visual settings. And then one christmas, about 3 years of begging in, my little brother who had only casually mentioned one time that it would be nice to have a better graphics card got a new graphics card for christmas. One of the better ones you could get at the time. I excitedly thought \"oh surely there will be one for me too. The person who has consistently asked for one.\"\n\n\n\nThere was not. In fact I had to watch every single year after that until the other 3 of my siblings got a new card before I got a hand-me-down card *from my sibling* because they had their own money and was upgrading again.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily things have changed now and the parent who didnt love me is out of the picture. If OP isnt careful, OP is gonna end up being the parent cut out of the picture one day.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, hell yeah you. You kick poverty's fucking ASS", "Tell me you nonchalantly break promises to your loved ones and play favorites with your children without telling me", "YTA.", "Don't you think it might be a good idea to let him know ahead of time instead of letting him wait until the last minute to ask because he likely assumes you'll help him due to helping him in the past? Why are you waiting every time for kids to come and ask you about financials when you already know the answer ahead of time?", "Found the OP\u2019s alt account", "Lighten up. Sounds like you might be OP other half.", "She probably been letting her daughter down her whole life.", "Well yes, of course the 'chosen child' is well catered for.", "I'm trying to figure out how they moved across country but in debt... and how they were able to pay for son but not daughter or pay their daughter back....", "Well... at least we have each other, right? \n\nIt's funny. A lot of my friends were the \"low-maintenance kids\" in their families too. We seem to find each other.\n\nWhen I was dating my husband, I thought he was a \"golden child\" because of the way his parents treated him. Then I went on a weeklong vacation with his whole family and... they just treated all of their kids really well? It was wild.", "Try going through something serious like loss and cancer, and then get back to me", "This checks out just by username", "Par for the course. Is the son the favorite? The daughter should go NC. Finish on her own and forget that she had a family.", "Well the special boy child will need a house bought for him first", "At least your husband has good parents. Hopefully they treat you like family too and are good replacement family.", "Ive gone through plenty of loss, bud. And what Ive gone through and what youve gone through doesnt change the fact the OPs an asshole.", "Oh they're wonderful! His mom schedules everything (she's very Type A but it all comes from a good place) and she is always careful to put \"introvert time\" into the schedule. First time she did it about brought me to tears. There's a quiet sun porch with good light. She always makes sure there's books and cool craft supplies in there before we visit. I told her she didn't need to, but she insists.\n\nMy parents are always like, \"Oh, we forgot to tell you, we're going to [sibling's] for [holiday] and we can maybe fit you guys in on an air mattress if you want to come out...\" and then they wonder why I hardly ever come out.", "I just read another good comment about in-laws and got teary reading about your \"introvert time\". Maybe we need a subreddit about good parents-in-law to wash away everything else we read here.", "Maybe one day your parents regret treating you like that. I hope they do, anyway. Before theyre on their deathbeds.\n\n\n\nYay for your in laws!"]}
