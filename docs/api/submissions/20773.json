You are also \"unable\" to help her this semester.\n\nDon't contact her until you have the cash in hand to pay her back.  I would think that moving across country for a job should have come with a really good pay raise.\n\nSheesh", "YTA. Sorry, but forgetting to pay her back is assholery. And you know what? Even if you disagree that forgetting to repay your debt to your own family crosses the asshole line, you're still an asshole. Why? Because you think your daughters short response of \"sure\" was wrong on her part. Buddy, that was the POLITEST response you could have gotten.\n\n\n\nAre parents obligated to help their children with tuition? No. But you *committed to helping them* and then renegged on one of your kids, AND THEN FORGOT THE DEBT, which shows a lack of respect for your daughter on your part. For all your daughter can estimate, you are simply renegging on both your debt and your commitment to help her with college. That makes you an asshole.\n\n\n\n\nYour daughter thus far has been incredibly forgiving. This is not chump change we are talking about here. Even if shes been working and saving since she was a teenager, you think that makes it ok to go back on your word to your child? Listen, I can forgive (and I think your daughter could too) you not having the money at the time to help both kids. What makes you an *absolute* asshole is literally everything that came AFTER that.\n\n\n\nIve been the sibling the parents do not financially help when I needed it. Ive been the sibling the parents dont get a large gift for when everyone else got a large gift. It fucking sucks. From your perspective, you think \"well Im GOING to pay her back. Why doesnt she trust me?\" But from her perspective, its closer to \"Why did my parents choose to help only my brother and then lie to me about paying me back?\" Because so far, thats what you've done. Youve lied.\n\n\n\nFYI, if you cant repay the money, the correct thing to do is to periodically (once a month or however long your daughter would like you to) send a text acknowledging you havent forgotten the debt, but things havent changed this period and you still cant repay her. Then apologize and say you cant help in the future either (because sounds like you cant)", "YTA\n\nYou told her you would pay her back and you didn't.  Its really that simple. \n\nLife happens.  If you and your husband are going through a financial hardship and can no longer pay tuition for your kids, you need to communicate that.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your daughter's responsibility to remind you to pay your debt to her. It's your responsibility to pay it. You just made it clear that she is your absolute last priority.

With her whole 3 years of work history? Bet you've been working at least 7 times as long, so why is it an issue for you? \n\nGet off your ass and get a side hustle or 2nd job until that debt is paid. Eat rice and beans and sell your jewelry. As a mother myself, I am appalled at your disregard for your promise to your child.\n\nAnd if you absolutely can't do that?

Middle child and only introvert in a family of extroverts here. My birthday is near Christmas.

I learned early that complaining just got me told to \"stop making drama.\" My birthday party is now a 40 person affair with all my aunts and uncles and cousins because everyone's in town for the holiday and I'd rather scream into a paper bag for 3 hours than be around that many people for that long?

Shit happens, deal with it. Take Joplin Missouri for example, do you really think that after the tornado things like this is what they were thinking about. Or having to pack up and move for jobs and having to navigate places you don\u2019t know, things get forgotten", "Hey guess what? I was raised in generational poverty", "Yup, didn\u2019t feel like typing all that out again", "Look, now you\u2019re getting it, shit happens", "Yes why do you have no empathy for the daughter?\nThe OP has also said in a comment that you may not have read that they won\u2019t be able to help the brother next term either\u2026 but they still haven\u2019t told him - so he\u2019s not going to be able to prepare.\n\nYou have no idea what their hardship is but from what they are saying on this post they are the AH for how they are handling the situation", "Listen, if you wanna lie and steal from family, thats your perogative. Im done.", "Good. Based on your replies of \"shit happens\" you wouldn't be able to manage money if you had it", "Well duh. We all have to use toilet. We can\u2019t survive without using the bathroom. Why are you mentioning something so obvious? Think before you type please.", "I do have empathy for her, but I do have more experience with being below the poverty level and realizing that shit happens, like this is the real world. I\u2019ve had to pawn and sell stuff just to keep a roof over my head, and I wasn\u2019t expecting any money back for what I did because I get it.", "Well, bye", "What? You think because people have money that means that shit won\u2019t happen to them? Get real"]}
