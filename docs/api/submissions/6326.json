It's usually at our grandparents house since they have the biggest place, but whenever someone gets a new place we'll have the next few parties there. Trent and my SO don't get along, they went to high school together and Trent was a bully. Trent tried to apologize but it was only because SO's job was hiring and Trent wanted him to put in a good word. My SO didn't accept and now we don't get invited to anything they host unless it's important holidays. \n\nThe party started around 7 and at 4 Trent texted me saying the party was going to be adults only and that we would need to find a sitter. We told them that it was fine and we'd stay home and Trent said I should still drop off the fireworks I bought. I told him I was going to pop them off with my kids but he thought that was selfish of me. I told him I didn't care, he said he didn't buy any because he heard my SO talk about how many fireworks he was planning to bring to the party. I told him that wasn't my problem and made sure to decorate the house for my kids because they were very excited for the party. My husband and I set up bubble machines and set up those fun spinning lights the kids love.\n\nI was supposed to give my sister Tori and her family a ride to the party so I called her to let her know I could still take her but Trent said the party was adults only so I could watch her kids while she went. She said she would get another ride but would bring her kids over. Our cousin Mary called and said she didn't know the party was child free (Tori called her for a ride) and asked if she and her kids could hang out with me and my family and that my sister had decided to stay with her kids at my place. I said yes and within a few minutes I had a lot of relatives asking if they could hang out at my place. Keep in mind I only told my sister about Trent's text.\n\nAbout 80% of my relatives were at my place by 6:30 and I ended up ordering a ton of food. We were all having a good time. Around 7:30 my brother Tom called and asked when we were showing up to the party and I said since it was child free we decided to spend it with our kids at home. He said no it's not and that his kids and a few other kids were there too. I told him about Trent's texts and he was confused because the party was definitely not child free. I sent him screenshots and I guess he confronted Trent about it. Trent, his wife, and parents are calling me petty for throwing a party to compete with theirs. Then they admitted it wasn't child free they just didn't want us there.\n\nHere's where I maybe the asshole, while I didn't throw the party intentionally once he started berating me I sent texts out to the family members that weren't at my place with a screenshot of Trent's  text saying hey if you need a babysitter for the party tonight I'm staying home with my kids. I started posting pictures and videos to Facebook and IG and by 11 almost all of the family was at my place.\n\nAITA for taking over their party?", "created_utc": 1672694023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101nw5r/aita_for_hosting_a_separate_nye_party/", "score": 537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trent was described to be a HS bully who only apologized for self serving reasons and all of this post goes on to show that they have not changed at all.

You weren't an a****** until you publicized everything, and tried to get everybody to come over, but that's the best part. You took his ass-holeness, and turned it around for everybody to see. You did it in a way that he couldn't try to play it back on you. He got exactly what he deserved. Not only that, all of those poor people who would have been without fireworks had they gone to his party, got to watch fireworks. Do not, in any way feel bad about what you have done.
