You will both be hanging onto your sanity by a thread and maximum stressed and feel like you are giving 100% and the other person only 50% - you just have to be extremely extremely kind because otherwise the hate and resentment grow so quickly.  \n\n'I'm just being honest' where 'honesty' is them just them wanting no consequences for hurting you has no place here - especially towards someone post partum who is flooded with a sea of crazy hormones trying to fix your body.  I burst into tears several times for absolutely no reason at all - just a random flood of emotions.  \n\nI think it's a good idea to sit him down and make it extremely clear that post partum you will be extremely, extremely vulnerable.  Physically and mentally you will be at your weakest - and on a instinctual and primal level what we need at that point is a mate who protects and supports us - who makes us feel safe.  If you don't feel safe - if you don't feel like your babies are safe those instincts can absolutely fork over your mental health. He's gonna need to step the fork up and acknowledge that you will need someone who can be gentle with you and provide that safe feeling you need.

And ideally, it wouldn't be great for the kids to see their parents arguing, od course. But honestly, it *would* be better for any kids to see their mom tell dad to shut up after he was being blatantly rude to her than it would be for them to see their dad insult mom and talk down to her for no reason. It's always better to teach your kids to stand up for tourself than it is to teach them that it's okay to be mean and rude to someone else. \n\n>This conversation went like this: you hurt me so now I\u2019m going to hurt you. Not the best plan if you\u2019re married. \n\nWhen one person is emotionally abusing the other and their response is essentially \"please stop\" (yes, shut up sounds harsh without context but remember that she is facing abuse), one of them is clearly more in the wrong than the other. Lashing out at someone who just wants to hurt does not carry the same weight as saying something just to hurt the other person. \n\n>They clearly have a different perspective of how this conversation went & neither one of them are interested in listening to another person\u2019s perspective. \n\nWell, the husband's perspective is bullshit, let's just get that out of the way. Under no circumstances is requesting a name she likes begging and being childish. To say those things to your partner when they bring up a name they like is pretty cruel. \n\n>There\u2019s nothing wrong with your most trusted life partner being honest. Often times they\u2019re right.\n\nOkay, but that wasn't the case here. \n\n>You\u2019re too excited.\n\nYou're too excited is nowhere near close to \"you're so desperate, you're childish, you beg too much\",", "\"And honesty without tact or compassion is just cruelty.\"", "Always stick up for yourself.

Seems to me the response could have been .... \u201cokay you tell me the names that get you really excited smartass\u201d. I read this as hubby doesn\u2019t really love the name so he said something stupid (as people often do). OP reacted & they were off to the races about who is right & who is wrong. It appears they were both being pretty honest with the intent of hurting each other feelings. They really should get help from a professional on how to communicate.\n\nMarried for 32 years, 4 kids (including twins) I can\u2019t imagine why these people may be stressed & not behaving their best right now ... lol (that\u2019s sarcasm).
