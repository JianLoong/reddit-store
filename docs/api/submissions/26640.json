I have definitely yelled shut up, you're being an asshole, etc. And I've had it twisted around on me to make me feel like I was a monster, and like retroactively I'd *earned* the abuse.\n\nBut angrily telling someone to stop abusing you is not wrong. Having a backbone is not wrong. Not ALWAYS being capable of politely telling someone abusing you to please stop, etc, is okay. You are human. You do not deserve this.\n\nYou need couple's counseling or to break up. Honestly. There aren't many choices here that won't leave you miserable forever. I'm concerned on why you've stayed with him for this long in the first place when you know he is like this... most likely you have been worn down over time and made to feel like you are crazy because \"he's just telling the truth\" -- but that itself is a manipulation and not reality. \n\nHe's making you feel crazy every time you defend yourself.
