{"id": 27813, "submission_id": "16ul27f", "title": "WIBTA If I Refused To Be A Bridesmaid In My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding?", "selftext": "So I (25F) recently learned that one of my best friends from college, Lila (25F) is engaged. I\u2019m incredibly happy for her, and I was initially excited until she told me what her and her fianc\u00e9 Ben\u2019s (27M) plans are for the wedding.\n\nFor some background, I met Lila in college. We were dorm roomies in freshman year, then roommates again at a nearby apartment in junior year. Senior year, she moved in with Ben and I got a new roommate. A few months later, the pandemic began. Ben and Lila used the pandemic to try and develop interests together. Both of them enjoy their at-home movie dates, so they tried to find film and tv series to watch together. A month into this endeavor, one of Ben\u2019s friends suggests Game of Thrones, and to say they got hooked is an understatement. Aside from her chosen field of study/work, I have legitimately never seen Lila so passionate about something. It became her and Ben\u2019s life. They watched the series, read the books, and even started dressing up for conventions. I thought it was super sweet, but I\u2019m not much of a high fantasy person, and I\u2019ve heard the show is heavy on gore and SA, which I have a lot of trouble sitting through. Lila did invite once to a re-watch party she and Ben hosted the next year (2021) but I declined and told her why, and she\u2019s not made efforts to get me interested since and says she gets it.\n\nWhile I would definitely call Lila and Ben\u2019s interest in the show obsessive, they don\u2019t push it onto other people and it\u2019s not caused issues so far when me or other friends aren\u2019t into it. That being said, I\u2019m worried that if I refuse to be a bridesmaid in her wedding due to her Game of Thrones theme, I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll actually take it poorly. I don\u2019t know if this makes me an asshole, but I genuinely do not want to put money into dress/hair/makeup for me to be styled as an imaginary character for a wedding. It feels ridiculous. She and her husband are going to be married dressed as their favorite characters (who are also either in a relationship or they think they should be? All the names are hard to keep up with and I get them confused), and the bridesmaids and groomsmen will also be styled to look like other characters, and the guests will be asked to wear the \u201chouse colors\u201d of the character the bride or the groom is dressed as, depending on which one invited them. We haven\u2019t been \u201cassigned\u201d characters yet, but I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t want to do it.\n\nI want Ben and Lila to have their special day, and I want it to be what they want, but I don\u2019t want to pay good money for what are essentially costumes of fake people. It feels weird, but I want to be supportive and not be a dick. WIBTA if I backed out?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify two things: my main concern is how much money I\u2019ll have to sink into this because she doesn\u2019t want simple dresses that sort of go with the characters, she wants full (somewhat extensive) costuming and most likely expensive styled lace fronts. I don\u2019t want to sink money into something that I\u2019m going to feel ridiculous wearing. Also, I wasn\u2019t necessarily asked, I was just added to a group chat and she said \u201cyou\u2019re all going to be my bridesmaids!\u201d I replied excitedly before she started rolling out all of these expectations.\n\nEDIT 2: I can\u2019t keep up with these comments, but I\u2019m seeing some common threads. No I don\u2019t think her wedding idea is stupid. No it\u2019s not the theme that\u2019s throwing me off. No I don\u2019t hate the show. She wants us to get new custom wigs and costumes, it will be at serious expense to each of us, and she will be keeping it all afterwards to display in her Game of Thrones room. I love Lila and I think her wedding theme is going to be fun, I just don\u2019t know if I can financially keep up, and if I could, it would be a lot of money going to something I really won\u2019t be comfy in that I then have to turn over to her, so I\u2019ll never get any more use out it. That\u2019s where my conflicting lies. I do not hate her or her theme or the show, I\u2019m just worried about being physically uncomfortable in an expensive costume, that will then go on a mannequin. It\u2019s also going to be an outdoor ceremony in spring and I\u2019m worried about the layers getting too warm.", "created_utc": 1695919672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ul27f/wibta_if_i_refused_to_be_a_bridesmaid_in_my_best/", "score": 1350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they want to have a GOT themed wedding, they should have a GOT themed wedding! I do think you could be a tiny bit less judgmental though. There are two separate issues here you're kind of conflating into one:\n\n1 - it's expensive to be a bridesmaid. This would be true regardless of theme. Even for a \"regular\" wedding, it's basically standard for bridesmaids to pay for dresses they won't wear again, hairstyles they don't like, heavy makeup that may not be their style. The bride can choose to either cover those expenses herself, or accept that not everyone will be able to spend that much and some people will say no. If you can't afford to spend the money, you can't afford it, and that would be true regardless of theme. It's okay to say no to being a bridesmaid for financial reasons. You **do not** have to tell her that you think her theme isn't worth spending money on.\n\n2 - you think the theme is stupid. This one, it's kind of on you to suck it up and celebrate your friend. You don't have to love the theme or agree with it or even know a single thing about the theme; all you have to do is show up in the general color scheme she asks for with a smile on your face and be happy that your friend found someone who shares her interests. If you genuinely don't think you can do that, then you should not attend the wedding at all. It's not your day and frankly, it shouldn't be her priority or her desire to make you love her wedding theme. If you can't get there on your own then it's better for you to stay home. \n\nWhere you **might** be an AH is if the bride offers to pay all the expenses for her bridesmaids and you still don't want to do it because you think it's dumb. If that ends up being the case, you will need to come up with a different excuse for declining the job; you cannot tell her that you think it's dumb and you don't want to.", "Eh, soft YTA.

And yes, I know there is SA in Game of thrones. Does it make it inherently bad? No. In fact in the series there are loads of moments where people who committed it get their dues quite badly for that specific reason, also lots where it doesn't because surprise surprise it's a story about war in a fantasy world.

Just stick on the costume and let her be happy for one day.", "YTA enjoy losing your friend. Being a bridesmaid is generally expensive.

It feels ridiculous\n\nVery slight YTA. You say a few times that you don\u2019t want to put money down because you think the theme is ridiculous, not that you can\u2019t afford it. But the theme shouldn\u2019t really affect your budget much. It\u2019s rare to be able to rewear bridesmaids dresses anyway.  Either you have the money or you don\u2019t.\n\nWhat would be reasonable is to have a conversation with Lila and tell her you\u2019re concerned about costs. Maybe choose a budget that you would be willing to spend to be a bridesmaid at a more traditional wedding, and tell her you can\u2019t go over that. If that is a problem for her, tell her you understand and are happy to attend as a guest. That way you aren\u2019t hurting her feelings by quitting before making any attempt to resolve the issue. As many have said, there are definitely decent looking costumes and lace front wigs for way less than the 1k price you are estimating, and it\u2019s also possible that Lila will be willing to help with some of the costs. She also may be willing to assign you a character/outfit that will be less expensive or won\u2019t require you to wear a wig at all. You can also ask her for help finding affordable stuff that she will be happy with. Just have an open conversation about it that focuses on your budget and not judging her for her wedding.\n\nEdit: just looked it up - there are reasonable quality costumes in the $100-$300 range, and styled wigs for $50-150. This might be even cheaper than some bridesmaids dresses. You can go lower too if she is willing to compromise quality", "YTA. Be a good friend. This isn\u2019t about you. It would be selfish to choose not to participate because you don\u2019t enjoy their passion.", "YTA. \n\nWould it be less weird if they asked you to dress up as real people?

You don\u2019t have to make it super expensive, you can rent a costume or talk to your friend about your limited expense. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to not want to do something but this isn\u2019t a simple party invite, not even a simple wedding invitation.

The fact you\u2019re so set on not going shows that it\u2019s an issue with the theme.

You're TA 100%. If you *would* spend the same amount of money on a more \"traditional\" bridesmaid dress you also wouldn't wear ever again just because it's *not* Game of Thrones if she was having a non-themed wedding, you're TA. \n\nIt sounds like you just have a weird extreme bias against this show and don't want to be involved in anything having to do with the show.

Yes, nice ones can't be purchased off the rack but ppl who make them are genuinely doing it out of love more than outrageous profit so I (a very geeky person with many high quality costumes) have usually found that if you shop around online (etsy is great) the price is equivalent to normal off the rack gowns.\n\nIf it's really only about the cost then just let your friend know what you can afford. At the end of the day i have never reworn a bridesmaid dress (I have 4 sisters, 3 sister in laws and literally dozens of cousins so I've been a bridesmaid/maid of honour/matron of honour/best woman many times) all the dresses are wastes of money as you only wear once. You do it out of love and support for the couple.", "Hmmm... there is not enough info here. Have you confirmed that you're expected to spend all this money? I'm planning to pay for my bridesmaids' dresses, and my wedding isn't themed or anything. Maybe she's contributing or paying for all/some of the cosplay. \n\nI think you're jumping the gun because you don't like the theme. Ask her some questions privately, like if they've priced out these things or not. Explain in a non-judgmental, compassionate way that you can't justify spending a lot on a cosplay you'll never wear. Give a budget you're willing to work with, maybe $200-$300 or something. \n\nIf this really is your best friend, you need to be willing to meet her halfway, and she should do the same for you. If she expects $1,000 cosplays, she needs to be willing to fork out some cash or adjust her expectations.

As a guest I control just how much I spend and how in detail I go, you don\u2019t have that choice as part of the wedding party. \n\nThat is my suggestion to you.

Tell her you don\u2019t want her to have to compromise her vision or cause her stress, so you need to talk about expectations up front to avoid hurting feelings down the road. That would be what you are comfortable spending on the outfit, makeup and accessories. If you are willing to dye your hair or wear a wig, and what type of character you are comfortable playing.  \n\nI am betting that several other people in the wedding have concerns, if you could get together and all document those and present them together that would be best. In situations like this the bridal party has to agree on more then just a dress type or hair style.  I would expect there would be fights about who plays which character as well.\n\nLastly a lot of people are asking what the difference between paying for a normal bridesmaid dress you will never wear again and a costume. I do believe that there is a difference, usually it it cost. That, or the fact that in addition to the outfit there is usually expectations on wild hair and makeup, and then the added discomfort in being able to relax in the outfit and dance and enjoy yourself. I may hate a dress, but typically I have a bit more control over the rest of my appearance to be comfortable functioning at the wedding. Now if the sole reason is simply you hate GOT, and it is not a moral objection to a lot of themes in the show (with this show that is in itself a reason to not want to participate as a woman), and the cost is no different then what would by a typical wedding party expense. I would lean towards a soft ahole judgment.", "INFO\n\nWhere is the \"WELL over a grand\" estimate coming from?", "NAH - I love a good theme.

I've needed dresses I'd *never* picked for myself to be altered professionally, which costs money. I've never even looked at the dresses after the weddings were over.  I did it because I wanted to be part of my friends' happiness and experience their joy with them. \n\n\nIf that's your concern, then you should clearly let your friend group know you're not looking to be *anyone's* bridesmaid, but again, that could cut you out of the group.", "Other people have pointed this out elsewhere but I\u2019ll add it here: if you have an elaborate cosplay costume, you can absolutely sell it.

I know this because I\u2019m a part of the fandom and I have friends who cosplay characters still. \n\nI feel like a big part of your hesitance is that you think you\u2019ll feel stupid wearing a costume, but the whole experience might actually be fun!

If everyone\u2019s in costume then everyone is ridiculous meaning no one is ridiculous.", "Just an FYI, most every single dress you're going to wear as a bridesmaid is going to be one you will never wear again to anything else. That is the nature of being a bridesmaid. The brides will always tell you that you'll have plenty of opportunities to wear the dress again. That is a lie. Very rarely, if ever, will you take that thing out of your closet once you put it in there. And it is the same with getting your hair and make-up done for a wedding. You don't get to have it done the way you'd like.. not usually. The bride decides if it is going to be up or down, curly or straight. They decide if you're going to have a smokey eye or look natural... They choose it all. You have no real autonomy when you're in a wedding. \n\nSo, my point is that the theme is kind of inconsequential because you'd be running into all of these very same issues just being a bridesmaid at a normal wedding.\n\nAsk yourself if you'd be saying yes if this was a standard wedding..

Be honest, tell her how much you would love to be a part of her wedding and how exciting it sounds (even if you don't love the theme) but there nothing wrong with asking how much she expects bridesmaids to front towards the cost of everything.", "That's a good amount of time to reach a compromise about the costume/dress, styling and costs.

Asking someone to dress up as some character, especially one that they've never heard of, is something else.  Cost aside, some people really don't like dressing up as a particular someone else.   I get that that's exactly what some people like - the chance to cosplay as someone else, but to others (what's the term - mundanes?), it just feels weird and alien to wear a wig and dress up as someone specific.

At least, if she could keep it, it could be used as a Halloween costume if not for the bride wanting all of the costumes for free.", "That's funny, because when you first started replying to comments it was \"over a grand\" but your more recent comments are \"minimum 3k\". If $1k is your limit then just tell your friend that?\n\nThis is a really simple conversation of \"I can't afford that\" but you're turning it into something else entirely. And you still haven't answered anyone asking the question 'would you still refuse to pay that much if it was a different theme?'", "I think it would be reasonable for you to approach the bride with some sort of nice, \"hey, I think your vision for your wedding is so suitable to you! I'm so touched you invited me to stand with you as part of your day. That said, with my current finances, I would have a budget of about $500\" (or whatever you deem reasonable) \"for dress, shoes, hair, and makeup to be a bridesmaid at a wedding. Would you think that's reasonable and able to fit your vision?\" And then follow up with whatever relevant questions could follow her answer: \"Would you rather I attend as a guest instead? I can still lend a hand with wedding prep without needing to be standing wirh you.\" Or if she thinks you could meet your budget to her vision, \"What are your suggestions to keep the cost down?\"", "I think OP is TA because it seems like she's doing a lot of assuming to get out of going, just because she doesn't like the theme.

OP is sounding very lazy, she is not putting a drop of effort in the marriage of her best friend..", "And u sound like those ppl who posted every week how their watching the latest GoT episode. The bride is literally making a simple wedding into some big thing based on a fictional fantasy world of fucking magic and dragons. Just cause ur friend has a unhealthy obsession doesn\u2019t mean you have to or participate in it. Also only OP gets to decide if they have the time and money not a bunch of random ppl on the internet that know little to nothing about OPs life. Not everyone makes it to the wedding and ur not an ah or less of a friend for not going.", "Reading your other comments, it's sounds like you've only made an assumption about what the price of the outfit will be. Sit down, figure out what you'd be willing to spend on a dumb bridesmaid outfit regardless of theme and talk to her about what she anticipates the cost of your outfits will be and work from there with all the real info, not your assumptions.", "Can you just communicate with her what you are and aren\u2019t able to afford? Then she will either choose whether she wants to make allowances to have you in her wedding, or have the theme wedding she wants without you in it. The way you talk about it here seems a very immature way of handling it.", "Oof. So you\u2019d be paying the majority of the cost for an outfit you won\u2019t even get to keep? Are you also expected to buy a regular gift as well?", "If she wants to keep them, she can pay for them.", "It doesn't work that way. If you buy a bridesmaid dress, you keep the bridesmaid dress.\n\nI've never even heard of a bride keeping the bridesmaids dresses when the bride bought them.", "GOT ended in 2019. Seems a bit odd to still be obsessed about it. \n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s debatable that a themed wedding will be more expensive for a bridesmaid than a traditional wedding. However, it you are concerned that being a bridesmaid is not within your budget, you are definitely NTA for declining.", "Some commenters have helped me figure out it\u2019s a girl named Sansa. When I googled that one the pics looked like what Lila showed me. I don\u2019t know who Ben is, I just know she made a comment about how his hair is dark enough/right length that he won\u2019t need a wig, just some styling. He\u2019s got dark brown hair, basically black in some lighting. Does that help at all, bc telling people Lila\u2019s character was a redhead helped", "Pay hundreds for a costume and then give it to the couple. I think that seals the NTA for me. You dont ask someone for that kind of financial commitment and then take things they paid for. \nEdited for a missing word lol", "The edit is the kicker. The bride expects to be \"gifted\" these expensive costumes after the wedding. OP can't even attempt to sell it to recoup some tiny percent of the price or keep it and repurpose it for Halloween for the next decade. OP is not the asshole for not wanting to spend on this.", "I was all ready to walk to the theme from Brideshead Revisited, until I realized that if anybody there recognized it, they would find it pretty unsettling given the marital misery endured by most characters in that show. Really pretty theme, though, and very wedding-y.", "Uh\u2026.yes, that\u2019s the point? The comment u/ed_lv was replying to makes reference to a Lannister theme with red clothes and blonde hair, which is why they joked about debts being paid.", "I really don\u2019t get the whole Sansa-hype thing. She was the least interesting character to me in both the books and the show.", "The price. And wigs are itchy.", "Ehh, that's not always the case regarding bridesmaid dresses.  They're typically more fancy than the usual dress a female wedding-goer would wear, but not always.  Then there's also the fact that a fancier bridesmaid dress can typically be worn to a black tie wedding without looking like a bridesmaid dress.", "I would have been with you on this, except for the seemingly over the top expense of things like custom wigs. A GOT custom dress is also likely to be a lot more expensive than your average bridesmaid dress. Where the bride went into AH territory was then expecting to keep the booty for herself. The bridesmaids could possibly resell those costumes and get much of their money back. Since the bride wants to keep the stuff, she needs to pay for all of it.  NTA", "She\u2019s given us very rough estimates in regards to hair, makeup, and clothing because it will all be very dependent on what we need for our characters. But she wants us to have new custom wigs, dresses, accessories, shoes, etc. It\u2019s not just a bridesmaid dress of a specific color or style, it\u2019s like the whole get-up with all the frills and intricacies. She says she knows people who are also fans that style wigs, make gowns, etc or are just very experienced with cosplay and that she can get a good deal, but it will still be very expensive and at minimum, any of us would be looking at like 3 grand over all. She\u2019s been saving for this, is going to keep saving, and is accepting donations on her social medias and stuff. She said she\u2019s more than prepared to go further in debt for her dream wedding.", "Except the bride wants the dresses at the end to display, not for the bridesmaids to keep", "My parents had a Halloween themed wedding and a lot of us rented our attire! I went in a Renaissance dress, and it was so inexpensive. I should note it is my mother's second marriage. It was fun, and not costly, and well worth it. The memories made were great. I can 100% second rentals!", "If she\u2019s a bridesmaid, she has to wear the wig. That shit is expensive!", "OP goes from 1k in the post to 3k in a comment.  Sounds hinky to me, like she wasn't getting the responses she wanted so the cost has more than doubled.", "Yeah maybe I'm reading too much of a tone, but OP seems to be looking for excuses. I really doubt the bride is expecting the wedding party to have professional grade costumes and wigs. At the very least if that's really the impression OP got from the bride then I'd expect they'd be able to talk about it as best friends.\n\nOn that note, if I was the bride and set ridiculous expectations I would hope my best friend of all people would tell me.", "She sounds anxious about it but I don\u2019t think it makes her TA. I think she needs to have a good talk with her friend and just to get on the same page. I\u2019d imagine her friend would be understanding if she backs out under the circumstances (big request/knows OP is uncomfortable with the show).", "We did The Rains of Castamere instead of the Wedding March during our Friday the 13th wedding. It was fun.", "I learned \u201cRains of Castamere\u201d for a friend\u2019s wedding a few years ago.

If she were a fan of Game of Thrones, then yes, she *could*, but the point is that she *isn't*, so she likely *won't*.\n\nNot only that, but in a lot of instances, a standard bridesmaid dress can be worn to other weddings without looking too over the top, especially black tie weddings.", "I think it's more the fact that she doesn't get to keep the dress.. it's going into the friends \"GOT room\". \nSo they spend all that money on a cosplay dress for something they know nothing about, and then give it up for free, that's a bit much. If the friend wanted to keep all the outfits for a display, she should buy them herself or at least reimburse, or give the option of not giving it up.", "Please read what is probably an update in the original post.  Bride wants them to pay money for the themed dresses/wigs and then the bride WANTS TO KEEP THEM.  I would be out. If I cannot resell it, I'm not buying it.", "Do brides not pay for bridesmaids' dresses anymore? I'd always get the dress and then maybe pay for shoes and whatever else. And we'd all go together to get our hair done and that was paid for by the bride or her family. The last wedding I went to I was just asked to buy a dress in a specific color to match the other women in the family as the bride didn't have bridesmaids.", "I have never reused any of the bridesmaid dresses because even when I had formal events to attend they were just not appropriate. Bridesmaid dresses are clearly bridesmaid dresses, and are usually too colorful for most formal events, unless you are going to a HS prom which would be weird for most bridesmaids. \n\nThere is no difference in reusability from a bridesmaid dress and this GOT cosplay outfit. Which again, if OP didn't want to wear something of her choosing to the wedding, the appropriate response to being asked to be a bridesmaid is \"no.\"", "If she is including hair/makeup in that, it could very well be close to $1k. The weddings I\u2019ve been in have had someone come and do makeup for like $100/person. I\u2019d imagine cosplay makeup and hair/wig could easily $250-$300.", "That\u2019s incredibly expensive, especially given that she wants to keep your costumes. NTA if you want to back out. If I were you I\u2019d also message her privately saying that you\u2019re honored to be her bridesmaid, but your maximum budget for this is ___. And if there\u2019s a way you could rent a dress for her wedding, etc. With the wedding planned for 2026, there\u2019s so much time to get a cheaper wig and outfit from online!\n\nPersonally I think if she wants to keep the costumes she should pay for them. However, if she\u2019s not offering, don\u2019t tell her that!", "NTA. But I would not back out outright. I would explain that you are so excited for her and can\u2019t wait to celebrate the day with her. I understand your vision for your day and I want it to be perfect. I took a look at my finances and I have X amount of money to be able to spend towards the wedding with the costume, hair, makeup and bachelorette party. Do you think we can make it work within this budget? If she says yes, I would clarify if the costume can be cheaper or if there is a certain amount of money she is allocating to some of the costumes? If she says no, then that is when you can politely bow out and explain you understand and maybe see if you can participate in the bachelorette party. Maybe help plan it a bit if you want to use that as reassurance that you do care about her.", "Lace front wigs sounds pretty professional\u2026 and it seems like the couple is taking it very seriously, so it seems like there are some valid excuses, but agreed, they just need to talk about it (and maybe the talk will help the bride/couple adjust their expectations too).", "Weddings are expensive. Being in a wedding is expensive. I was in a wedding last year and spend about two grand on dress, makeup, and flight, and that was a year\u2019s notice. A different wedding a couple years ago was about $900. \nAnd OP clearly says they don\u2019t want to pay it BECAUSE of the theme. They never answer the question of what would happen if it was a normal dress. They are not obligated to go, but they shouldn\u2019t expect to stay friends with them. 3 years is a long time to know your friend thinks your wedding theme is stupid and won\u2019t attend.\nBesides, you can 100% resell the costume after the wedding.", "Sansa/Jon is a fairly popular ship and plenty of people genuinely think it'll happen. Sorry to be a bearer of bad news lol", "For the record I don\u2019t disagree, but I love how the cousin sibling thing is the least objectionable of the common possibilities for her. This show.", "You're seriously objecting to an incest pairing? From the notorious incest show? Really?", "I bet it is those two. On AO3 it is the most popular ship behind Jaime/Brienne.", "Really depends on where you\u2019re from. I\u2019ve never had the bride pay for my bridesmaid\u2019s dress (though hair+makeup has been gifted on the day) but I know cousins in the UK have paid for their bridesmaids\u2019 outfits.", "it depends tbh? for my sister\u2019s wedding, my mother paid for my dress and styling cuz family but for my bff\u2019s weddings, i bought the dress myself for both and we all did our hair & makeup ourselves as per the couples instructions. But they were also pretty reasonable (one did any grey dress that was cocktail length & i still wear that dress to formal events, another did long dress but same designer & colors but both were maybe like 200$ each). I honestly would usually expect to buy the dress or at least foot some kind of money in being part of the bridal party, but not amounts that are beyond reach of the members of the party. \n\nWhat really gets me about OP\u2019s situation is the bride expects them to GIVE her their costumes at the end of the event. Then she should be the one paying for it!", "Yes, but is it really that common to have to buy more than the dress? I wore my own shoes, jewelry, etc for my friend's wedding. The only thing I had to buy was the dress.", "I think you are vastly underestimating that people like she\u2019s describing will be the type to spend a ton on this wedding! The wedding industry is crazy!  \n\nEdit: will not won\u2019t", "Glad you got it sorted out. I love poshmark!", "The outfit includes a lace front wig. That is not reasonable. \n\nAnd it also was not reasonable for your friend to rack up $2k in bills on your behalf, or your other friend to charge you $900.

It's that, or one or both parties are dead lol.", "I actually don't care about the ship or fictional incest, but making an incest ship the focus of a wedding that has non-fandom folks in it is wild.

I know those scenes also occurred in the show, but I think that maybe book readers are more okay with these ships specifically because they\u2019re not watching teenage Sophie Turner and 40-something Rory McCann.", "Yeah, now that I think about it, shoes and jewelry depend on the bride.  I let my bridesmaids where their own but I was a bridesmaid twice and both times I had to buy specific shoes and jewelry.", "I have never heard of the bridesmaids\u2019 stuff being paid for by the bride or family.  Having to pay for your own bridesmaid\u2019s dress is even a specific plot point in the movie Bridesmaids.", "Ah well, we didn't have one. On a budget, and we'd have never watched it.", "Likely, but Sansa was never really linked with anyone in a positive, romantic sense (at least not on the show as far as I can remember). But far be it for me to question some random couple's wedding decisions. As long as they are happy, good for them. Hopefully OP can be a character with her own color hair.", "Yeah, that's why off-topic: was referring to your comment about your daughter and your general 'it is weird to dress up as unknown characters' statement."]}
