{"id": 27813, "submission_id": "16ul27f", "title": "WIBTA If I Refused To Be A Bridesmaid In My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding?", "selftext": "So I (25F) recently learned that one of my best friends from college, Lila (25F) is engaged. I\u2019m incredibly happy for her, and I was initially excited until she told me what her and her fianc\u00e9 Ben\u2019s (27M) plans are for the wedding.\n\nFor some background, I met Lila in college. We were dorm roomies in freshman year, then roommates again at a nearby apartment in junior year. Senior year, she moved in with Ben and I got a new roommate. A few months later, the pandemic began. Ben and Lila used the pandemic to try and develop interests together. Both of them enjoy their at-home movie dates, so they tried to find film and tv series to watch together. A month into this endeavor, one of Ben\u2019s friends suggests Game of Thrones, and to say they got hooked is an understatement. Aside from her chosen field of study/work, I have legitimately never seen Lila so passionate about something. It became her and Ben\u2019s life. They watched the series, read the books, and even started dressing up for conventions. I thought it was super sweet, but I\u2019m not much of a high fantasy person, and I\u2019ve heard the show is heavy on gore and SA, which I have a lot of trouble sitting through. Lila did invite once to a re-watch party she and Ben hosted the next year (2021) but I declined and told her why, and she\u2019s not made efforts to get me interested since and says she gets it.\n\nWhile I would definitely call Lila and Ben\u2019s interest in the show obsessive, they don\u2019t push it onto other people and it\u2019s not caused issues so far when me or other friends aren\u2019t into it. That being said, I\u2019m worried that if I refuse to be a bridesmaid in her wedding due to her Game of Thrones theme, I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll actually take it poorly. I don\u2019t know if this makes me an asshole, but I genuinely do not want to put money into dress/hair/makeup for me to be styled as an imaginary character for a wedding. It feels ridiculous. She and her husband are going to be married dressed as their favorite characters (who are also either in a relationship or they think they should be? All the names are hard to keep up with and I get them confused), and the bridesmaids and groomsmen will also be styled to look like other characters, and the guests will be asked to wear the \u201chouse colors\u201d of the character the bride or the groom is dressed as, depending on which one invited them. We haven\u2019t been \u201cassigned\u201d characters yet, but I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t want to do it.\n\nI want Ben and Lila to have their special day, and I want it to be what they want, but I don\u2019t want to pay good money for what are essentially costumes of fake people. It feels weird, but I want to be supportive and not be a dick. WIBTA if I backed out?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify two things: my main concern is how much money I\u2019ll have to sink into this because she doesn\u2019t want simple dresses that sort of go with the characters, she wants full (somewhat extensive) costuming and most likely expensive styled lace fronts. I don\u2019t want to sink money into something that I\u2019m going to feel ridiculous wearing. Also, I wasn\u2019t necessarily asked, I was just added to a group chat and she said \u201cyou\u2019re all going to be my bridesmaids!\u201d I replied excitedly before she started rolling out all of these expectations.", "created_utc": 1695919672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ul27f/wibta_if_i_refused_to_be_a_bridesmaid_in_my_best/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your reasoning is justifiable, and you have every right to say no to being a bridesmaid even if she\u2019s your best friend \u2014 as long as you say no as your first and definite answer and not switching up weeks later. However, please take into consideration that she\u2019s you best friend as well as she is understanding of your distaste for GOT. Perhaps make a small effort to at least show up as a guest. At least go for a little bit. What matters is that you show up and try to have a good time and not make it about yourself. Even if you go just for an hour. \n\nI understand your situation because I\u2019ve been in a similar one where my best friends were friends with someone that made me uncomfortable once. I would get triggered whenever I saw that person and my anxiety would spike. I sucked it up because they were my besties and still showed up at their parties where that person would be showing up too\u2026 but I made sure to set boundaries. I would only go for an hour and then leave. They understood and were appreciative of me showing up. If your best friend truly loves you, she will understand your decision and will work something out with you so that you\u2019re more comfortable. You never know, you might actually have a great time and end up staying throughout the entire ceremony. Best of luck with all of this.\n\nMy answer: Inconclusive AH", "I cannot wrap my head around how people are so obsessed with tv.

They sound like they've been pretty reasonable about their Fandom in the past, so don't make any decisions without talking it out first.  You both may decide it would just be better for you to be a guest and let someone else who's more excited about the theme take the bridal party position. \n\nAnd to be clear, I'd feel the same way for any wedding that might require a large outlay from guests, be it destination, cosplay, or black tie.", "NTA, it's their wedding and you're under no obligation to do it.

If they want to have a GOT themed wedding, they should have a GOT themed wedding! I do think you could be a tiny bit less judgmental though. There are two separate issues here you're kind of conflating into one:\n\n1 - it's expensive to be a bridesmaid. This would be true regardless of theme. Even for a \"regular\" wedding, it's basically standard for bridesmaids to pay for dresses they won't wear again, hairstyles they don't like, heavy makeup that may not be their style. The bride can choose to either cover those expenses herself, or accept that not everyone will be able to spend that much and some people will say no. If you can't afford to spend the money, you can't afford it, and that would be true regardless of theme. It's okay to say no to being a bridesmaid for financial reasons. You **do not** have to tell her that you think her theme isn't worth spending money on.\n\n2 - you think the theme is stupid. This one, it's kind of on you to suck it up and celebrate your friend. You don't have to love the theme or agree with it or even know a single thing about the theme; all you have to do is show up in the general color scheme she asks for with a smile on your face and be happy that your friend found someone who shares her interests. If you genuinely don't think you can do that, then you should not attend the wedding at all. It's not your day and frankly, it shouldn't be her priority or her desire to make you love her wedding theme. If you can't get there on your own then it's better for you to stay home. \n\nWhere you **might** be an AH is if the bride offers to pay all the expenses for her bridesmaids and you still don't want to do it because you think it's dumb. If that ends up being the case, you will need to come up with a different excuse for declining the job; you cannot tell her that you think it's dumb and you don't want to.", "Eh, soft YTA.

Not that it's been officially priced out, which is an important distinction, and one that easily makes for a point to the bride, I can only invest X amount into this, otherwise, I'm thrilled to be a guest. Leaving them both at NAH.", "AND? \n\nShe said \"I don't want to pay that much for the theme\" not that she didn't want to pay that much period. If it wasnt GOT, she'd pay...so the price is irrelevant here.", "It's LITERALLY about not wanting to spend over $1K for a bridesmaids dress, LOL.", "No, you're being disingenuous.\n\n>I was just added to a group chat and she said \u201cyou\u2019re all going to be my bridesmaids!\u201d I replied excitedly\n\n\nSo they have you on record, in writing, being excited about this, so you can't use the \"told\" thing as an excuse.", "Hmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think they\u2019re allowed to just dump all that commitment onto you without asking you first. Just have a conversation with her. Explain your thoughts and feelings about all of this and decide together what your next move will be. Again, if she is your best friend and truly cares about you, your friendship will be okay regardless of your decision.", "Oh, I've always wanted to have \"the rains of castamere\" played at a venue, I bet that these people would actually get it!", "I went to a superhero wedding, and it was literally just men wearing superhero shirts under their tuxedos and ripping them open. And the husband was dressed like Clark, Kent and the wife was super girl. Which was \ud83d\ude12 side eye cuz they are cousins in the comics but cute wedding.", "BOOM, this.\n\nYou'd actually get more use out of a cosplay wedding outfit than you would from a traditional wedding. Think Halloween, Renn faires, Purim.\n\nYou can also resell the dress after the fact. The fandom isn't dead yet, there's still a market for them.", "That was my thinking too. Its Ygritte and Jon or Jon and Danaerys. \n\nBut I'm holding out hope its Brienne of Tarth and Tormund \ud83e\udd23", "Funnily enough my first thought was Melisandre but that\u2019s just because I think she is cool.", "The comfort level of the person wearing them and willingness to play the part.", "Honestly? OP would probably be able to resell a GOT cosplay get up a lot more easily than a bridesmaid dress!", "Sansa Stark has red hair as well. She would definitely have a fancy dress.", "The photo she showed me was a girl who looked like a princess", "The option about renting the costume is excellent. The other, not so much. You cannot show up to that kind of wedding with a walmart quality level costume. And unless you have a lot of experience with cosplay,  making your own costume is not really an option due to all the time and money you have to spend on quality materials and building it. And OP's concern is comfort and not going overboard paying a lot for a costume they will wear only once.", "Yeah, I want to know how she came up with that estimate. That's obviously an unreasonable amount to spend, but is OP just assuming that based on what the character's clothes look like? Or has the bride given her a specific costume/pieces that she must buy? There are definitely ways to make, rent, or piece together a costume that looks fancy for way less than $1k.", "She didn\u2019t state anywhere that the bride demanded a $1000+ look. I think that\u2019s the OP\u2019s own estimate", "This is the very specific point I'm commenting on as well. \n\nLike 97% of the time in most cultures, being a bridesmaid for someone's wedding means shelling out a bunch of money for an outfit you definitely don't like and will definitely never wear again. \n\nIf she *is* willing to do this for, say, just some regular bridesmaid-style ugly satin orange dress, but she's *not* willing to do it for a Game of Thrones-themed dress,  then she's 1000% TA. But if she's not willing to spend money *at all* on *any* dress, regardless of whether or not it's themed from a show, then it's consistent and while it's going to be a let down for the bride, I guess she'd be not TA.", ">my main concern is how much money I\u2019ll have to sink into this because she doesn\u2019t want simple dresses\n\nYou're sure reading a lot between the lines.", "She said she thinks it will be that much, but provided no reasoning for that, other than the dresses look fancy--there are a lot of ways to make or rent a costume for less that a grand. She can also sell it afterwards.", "Who said it was 1k ? She said it could be over that much , but  plenty of comments saying it doesn't have to cost nearly that much she's just assuming it will cost that much cause she already hates the idea and is trying to think up reasons to say no", "I've seen a few comments and say this, but I don't see where OP actually said this...? All I saw is a comment of hers where she said that she imagines it's going to be up to $1000. Why would she think that? What made her think it's going to be that expensive?", "I went to a wedding once that did this. Once the bridal party entered, all the doors to the dining hall were closed and the beginning notes of Rains started to play. Only the people in our age group/younger seemed to get it. It was hilarious.", "Playing it at my wedding next month during the ceremony and I'm so excited to see the various reactions \ud83d\ude02", "Gonna be completely honest: I've found some weird corners of the internet so I wouldn't be surprised if it was Sansa and The Hound or something (I think that ship is more popular among book readers, but still), which... I mean, normally I'm all for not yucking someone's yum but OP should be aware that a lot of the relationships in the show/books are pretty fucked, just in case someone ever sees these photos and assumes she supports one of the more disturbing relationships.\n\nI don't think it could be Jon/Dany if the bride has red hair, and tbh with how it worked out for them I would feel weird going to a a wedding based on that too.", "That's what I was thinking. Cosplay at Cons is huge.", "Either one of Sansa's weddings would be an... interesting choice. Especially the second one. Then again, if the couple has a sense of humor, why not?", "Ah, as other person pointed out, that may be an actual princess. Which had two weddings. First one was creepy and occurred under very messed up circumstances. Second one was an utterly screwed up wedding to a deranged violent psychopath.", "I\u2019m a bit confused by your comment - What other option beside renting a costume did I give?\n\nShe can defo do her own hair (I\u2019ve done the GoT braids lots of times). Rent a beautiful dress and you\u2019re GTG", "That sounds frightening and glorious!", "I hope you have a very wonderful wedding with scared guests :-)", "Thank you!"]}
