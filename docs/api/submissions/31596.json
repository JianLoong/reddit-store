{"id": 31596, "submission_id": "182idst", "title": "AITA for leaving Thanksgiving because my partner's creepy brother was there?", "selftext": "I (F25) and my partner (M26) have been friends for a few years and started dating more seriously early this year. This was the first time he's invited me to Thanksgiving -- he called it a Friendsgiving when he pitched it. His parents, who I adore, were hosting it, but it was mostly their friends and his friends, not extended family -- as he put it. I guess for whatever reason I assumed his brother wouldn't be there. \n\nI've tried really hard to be nice to his brother. He has always creeped me out with staring, hovering, etc. -- but he reads as neurodivergent (I think he's diagnosed ADHD but it seems a lot more severe to me). But I tried to be nice. Then last year, my partner asked if his brother could come with us and our friends on our big summer renaissance fair road trip, and I told him how I felt uncomfortable around is brother and didn't want him to spoil this trip (in nicer words than that) and my partner assured me he wouldn't. He... kind of did. I felt like I was babysitting a little kid for most of the trip, but whatever. It was a few weeks after that that my partner posted something on Instagram and his brother commented, and I went to snoop on his Instagram as one does -- and saw that he'd drawn a bunch of pornography of me while we were on our trip. I mean very obviously of me. I brought it up to my partner and he mostly seemed to brush it off? I didn't exactly say how uncomfortable it made me, but I also don't feel like I should've had to spell that out! \n\nI've been pretty clear that I don't want to be around his brother after that. I've had dinner with him and his parents occasionally, but his brother usually either isn't there or stays up in his room. He might come down to get a plate of whatever we're eating and pass by, but he never stays -- I *thought* because my partner conveyed to him that I'm not okay with being around him. \n\nAnyway. Friendsgiving today. I was honestly having a blast. I got up early and spent all morning making side dishes. I was enjoying spending time with our friends and his parents. And then his brother turns up. And gets sat at the \"kids\" table with us, right next to me. It isn't even that he was there, but that my partner didn't feel inclined to warn me or make sure we weren't sat together or anything.\n\nI feel terrible now, like I overreacted, but I just got up to leave. I went over to his coat and got the keys, and when he asked what I was doing, I might have raised my voice a bit and told him he could either spend time with me or his creepy ass brother. Which was, like. maybe not the thing to do in front of this whole twenty person gathering. We also drove together so I kind of left him stranded, but he WAS at his parents house with his side of the family and we live nearby. Someone probably gave him a ride. I went to my sister's about forty minutes away. He hasn't tried to call or text me. \n\nDid I overreact? AITA?\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you all for your input -- genuinely. I'm staying with my sister and she's ready to go into this situation swinging a baseball bat, but I knew she'd be like that and I wanted some more candid opinions from people who aren't already on my side. \n\nThe main advice I'm getting is to be more explicit with my communication and this is honestly something I've been working on for a while. My family isn't a \"directly and verbally express your needs\" family, which isn't an excuse but hopefully is an explanation. I try to remind myself that no one can read my mind and failed in this case.\n\nI really shouldn't have blown up at the party and I'm extremely aware of that. I wish I had stepped out with my partner and reminded him of my feelings about his brother and given him a chance to correct it. I'm sure we've all gotten angry and wished we could take it back. \n\nAnd I guess I should have assumed he would be there. My partner specifically pitched it as some of his friends and some of his parents' friends. And if he had just come down to get a plate like he normally does, it would've been fine. His brand of neurodivergence includes not liking big crowds of people. Also this guy is 24 -- I forgot to include in the main post. He's not a kid. \n\nAnyway. I hadn't really had the perspective to consider the long-term feasibility of just avoiding my BIL. I'm going to text his parents to apologize (I should call, but I don't want to demand their attention if they're really pissed at me) and explain a little where it was coming from. I took screenshots of the IG post that I'll share with them if they ask. (Also, to answer a common question, I guess it would be \"lewd art\" rather than pornography. He draws fat fetish art and drew someone who looks like me wearing 10% my ren fair garb and 90% nothing in a compromising pose.) \n\nI'm going to suggest a pause with my partner through the holiday season, at the very least -- if he doesnt dump me first, that is. I don't think this relationship is feasible if he isn't going to do the bare minimum of trying to keep me safe. \n\nThank you all again -- I mean it.

You told your partner about this and expressed your discomfort and 3. You don't have to stay somewhere that you're uncomfortable. At the very LEAST your partner should have told you that his brother would be there and taken steps to ensure you were not sitting close to each other / not in each other's space. \n\nWith that said. You were invited to a thanksgiving that you know his parents would be at, and it was at his parents' house, and...you assumed brother would be elsewhere? Why? I would have been assuming brother would be there, and in your position, would likely have asked my partner to make sure and expressed the expectation that I am not sitting close to him / do not interact with him. \n\nI am not in any way trying to excuse brother's creepy behaviour - it's not okay and you deserve to be protected from it. However, as a person with a neurodivergent sibling, it's not always easy to deal with their unsociable behaviour. Depending on the manner of neurodivergence, brother might not understand what he's done wrong or what he should do to make it better. I see it as the role of the parents to either teach him this, or take steps to keep him away from / control his behaviour. Your partner may not feel able to step in (brother may not listen to him, or parents might not back him up - I can't tell you the number of times I was told off for getting annoyed with my brother's unsociable behaviour). However, if that's the case your partner should be bringing it up to his parents and getting their support with keeping brother away from you. Obviously I don't know brother and don't know the level of his neurodivergence - what I've said above really applies in the case where he doesn't have full capacity to understand social interactions and inferences. If it's solely adhd, this doesn't really apply at all.\n\nI do think you have the responsibility to ask whether brother will be at x event - it's going to be easier and more polite to refuse to go before the fact, rather than making a scene in front of the whole family and their guests. To be clear, I still think you were in the right to prioritise your own comfort - your partner should've done that too and he failed you. But it's wild to me that you just assumed the brother wouldn't be there when it was at their parents' house and his parents were hosting. Why would they NOT invite their son?

Your boyfriend should have listened to your feelings and advocated for you. On the other hand you never came out and clearly stated your discomfort before your big blow up. You implied and just thought he would get where you were coming from. You assuming the brother would not be at HIS PARENTS house where HE LIVES for Thanksgiving is really na\u00efve and on you for not asking about it. He has been there every other time you have gone why would he not be there for a family holiday? I think that you are at fault for not making yourself clear and should apologize to your boyfriend and his family for ruining their Thanksgiving. The only reason I\u2019m going ESH is because your boyfriend should have stepped up more when you said you didn\u2019t really want his brother on the trip and when you showed him the \u201clewd art\u201d.", "YTA. You\u2019re a spoiled little girl and you\u2019re not ready for serious dating. \n\nCreepy family members are part and parcel of serious relationships and marriage.  You can\u2019t expect someone to give up their flesh and blood because you\u2019re uncomfortable for a few hours. \n\nLeave this guy alone and ride the cock carrousel until you\u2019re ready for more serious commitments.", "OP should share those pictures with the entire family.  That shit is *waaay* out of line.\n\nAnd then dump the guy who insisted on exposing OP to the creep who is perving on her while OP is dating (hopefully not for long) the brother.", "She said the brother reads as neurodivergent, and didn't describe his behavior as aggressive or sexual. You're way off base here.", "Why would she not assume the brother would come downstairs to eat at Thanksgiving at the house he lives at with his family there?", "Finally someone who is honest! She was a assholes for sure!", "Should not be unpopular opinion because it is realistic. She was a dick to everyone there at the get together. The parents who she adores definitely don't adore her. I would be shocked if she even still has a bf. Insulting her bfs bro is a good way to get kicked out of a relationship.", "TIL sexually deviant behavior is totally acceptable as long as you\u2019re neurodivergent /s", "The brother appears to live at the house where the party occurred. I feel like the boyfriend didn\u2019t mention it because it seems like a given. \n\nOn that note, however, I am not excusing any of the behavior described in the post.", "This was really freaky. I\u2019d go scorched earth if a family member did that to my partner. Signals to me that her partner may have more red flags that they are hiding.", ">Well this is wildly untrue. I have one sibling who thinks the absolute opposite way to the rest of us. His views and general disrespect for other people is not how he was raised at all.\n\nexactly. One sibling. Different from the rest. The 3 of you are how you were raised and there is an outlier\n\nIn this case it is both. That makes it more likely to be how they were raised", "Excellent point and also thank you! \ud83d\udc9a -someone in cat rescue", "when they are acting dang near identical thats almost always because of upbringing. Especially with its an ND man drawing the porn and not caring about consent. \n\n\"mommys special boys can do no wrong, the mean old girles just are mean\" type parenting. see it far too often here", ">immediate family\n\nI was looking for someone else who caught this. Drove me nuts! He's a brother/son, that's part of the definition of immediate family.", "I would like her to tell us how it went if she told her BF that she will never be around his brother with some developmental disorder. Because he is creepy and she doesn't like him. I would laugh and tell her we are done.", "I interpreted Friendsgiving as the parents inviting their and their children's friends rather than extended family such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. Why would the parents invite one son and his friends while turfing out their other son, a neurodivergent guy who, according to OP, has to be constantly babysat?", "She was in a room full of people lol", "He went out of his way to call it a friend giving because he knew full well that had he said THANKSGIVING that his brother being  there would make her say NO. So it was NOT a given. He lied and deceived her because he KNEW a that she was not comfortable.", "He posted them online, they either are aware of them or they will be eventually. OP should get ahead of this and at least show their mutual friends what Creepy Brother did so (Hopefully Ex) Boyfriend gets a shaming, which they will do if they are decent people. If it were me I'd also send an apology text to the parents for leaving and explaining that \"I was extremely uncomfortable being around Creepy Brother because he drew me in a lewd fashion with accessories from my Ren Faire costume\" along with screenshots. If OP does the correct thing and dumps her crummy boyfriend she'll never see them again anyway.", "And it doesn't have to be Thanksgiving foods. It's a way to celebrate that you're thankful for your friends, either on or around the actual holiday.", "Before extrapolating all this, we need to first know if the bf agrees that the drawings were of OP's likeness. Wonder if bf did not see the likeness and felt OP is overreacting but did not know how to tell her that without upsetting her.\n\nBesides, the brother seems have been drawing a fat person in ren faire garb. Ren faire garbs are usually full sleeves with ankle length skirts. It is possible that the bf did not even consider it as porn, but regular art that his might have been drawing since their younger years.", "I think she just didn't want to be sat right next to the dude who keeps creeping on her.", "Sorry, I forgot that sexual assault only happens in dark alleyways", "The brother lives in the house. I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t have warned her, and again, I am not excusing any behavior, but the brother does live there so there is an assumption that he will be around without it being explicitly stated.", "I mean yeah but ideally this would also get the pictures taken down, which may be a benefit in itself\u2026", "Most people just age out of having friends", "The drawings included specific references to her renfaire garb after they were both on a renfaire road trip. It was intentional and disturbing.", "OP states it was specifically her ren faire garb, and less than would usually be present when out in public. It was intentional fetish art.", "Thank you! Like. I'm and artist and had people claim I drew them... but very much did not. The response also ignored the fact I've had this same thing happen to me - the reason I knew was because this person didn't draw a lot, lusted after me in person  and drew the charavter in question wearing goggles I was well known for. But i wouldnt assume art done with my hairstyle, eye colour, and hair colour was of me - lots of people have the same style and general look.", "I'm also confused how he drew pornographic images of her but the pictures still had 10% of the clothes on and the images were able to stay posted on Instagram, the social media app that gets censored the most for that type of content.\n\nAlso, don't understand how OP never asked her bf if the brother was going to be there when the brother lives there and the rest of his family was going to be there.  That's a common sense first question to ask", "Nah.", "That's ridiculous.", "I think it is also possible that the BF has been conditioned to brush off his brother's bad behavior due to his \"issues\". A lot of families do that. And it then becomes an involuntary response, rather than really thinking about what is/was happening.", "This is OPs take on it, who did not like the brother even before they went on that road trip. It might be biased or it might be not.\n\nDoes the BF concur with OPs inference? This is important for context.", "She could have been like thanks for the invite but if your brother is going to be there I am not coming.  Went to her sister's to start.", "I'm obviously joking. You need that stupid /s thing?", "That is still both brothers behaving inappropriately, it's still both of these people's children. It's still suspicious about their parenting that both of their children are  behaving badly. Infact for him to be conditioned that way it pretty much has to be from the way he was raised", "And he could have said \u201chey do you want to come sit beside the guy drawing naked pictures of you and making you feel extremely uncomfortable for thanksgiving?\u201d", "You don't invite coworkers families or neighbors to friendsgivings. You invite your FRIENDS to friendsgivings. The neighbor and your coworkers family that you aren't friends with, don't matter.", "Are you a parent or a single child?", "Absolutely that is much better communication than either have been doing it's honest and gets everything out in the open.", "Neither.\n\nI am someone who has a sibling and a partner (not sure what you mean by single child) and has worked with 100s of children/ parents/ families with issues", "I meant only child. Sorry, single was weird and not what I meant. Lol. I respect your opinion, I just don't fully agree.", "The argument you\u2019re going with is seriously \u201cthe pornographic drawings of a woman who looks like you is just a coincidence.\u201d This creep sounds like he\u2019s a half step away from straight up assaulting OP, but let\u2019s keep making excuses for the pathetic incel.", "When there is an asshole in the family, there is an asshole in the family. If there are 2 assholes in the family, odds are a there are more than 2 assholes in the family.", "She should leave, if her partners brother is drawing porn of her and her partner doesn't care then she needs to leave", "I mean about the porn, and larger situation, obviously. But in the post she repeatedly says \"I tried to be nice\" \"I brushed it off\" \"I didn't say how uncomfortable it made me\" etc. Outside of this particular situation, doing that with a partner will set one up for failure forever and will lead to a pattern of people pleasing and then explosion.", "That's where I was leaning. The drawings could look a little like her in one or more features but not be about her at all. There are people who do lookalike.", "There is precisely zero evidence in the post that the creepy brother doesn\u2019t know right from wrong. You invented that detail in your zeal to cape for an incel.", "Creeper.", "Dude. He's *drawing and posting porn of her*.", "And there\u2019s a vast vast range of levels of talent in online artists. I\u2019ve definitely seen plenty of stuff where if you know who it is *supposed* to be you can see it, but if you didn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t be so clear - which also means that someone else can see it as someone else potentially.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s definitely what happened here, just that I think more info is required to figure out exactly what is going on with everyone.", "Oh. You meant the fiance is the \"good brother\". \nA better brother and parents would protect the son who is being creepy by giving him healthy boundaries and consequences for his creepy behaviour.", "Special needs gets the benefit of the doubt in a story like this until we have an accurate representation of his level of special needs", "That\u2019s true. I\u2019ve come around on that part. Especially after reading the edit", "Who would have conditioned him to do that?", "Yeah. They're doing him a real disservice by not communicating what's wrong. Have a good day.", "I agree that both brothers are being AHs. I think it is unfair to blame the parents. Or maybe it is fair. I will just agree to disagree."]}
