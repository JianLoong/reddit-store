This was the first time he's invited me to Thanksgiving -- he called it a Friendsgiving when he pitched it. His parents, who I adore, were hosting it, but it was mostly their friends and his friends, not extended family -- as he put it. I guess for whatever reason I assumed his brother wouldn't be there. \n\nI've tried really hard to be nice to his brother. He has always creeped me out with staring, hovering, etc. -- but he reads as neurodivergent (I think he's diagnosed ADHD but it seems a lot more severe to me). But I tried to be nice. Then last year, my partner asked if his brother could come with us and our friends on our big summer renaissance fair road trip, and I told him how I felt uncomfortable around is brother and didn't want him to spoil this trip (in nicer words than that) and my partner assured me he wouldn't. He... kind of did. I felt like I was babysitting a little kid for most of the trip, but whatever. It was a few weeks after that that my partner posted something on Instagram and his brother commented, and I went to snoop on his Instagram as one does -- and saw that he'd drawn a bunch of pornography of me while we were on our trip. I mean very obviously of me. I brought it up to my partner and he mostly seemed to brush it off? I didn't exactly say how uncomfortable it made me, but I also don't feel like I should've had to spell that out! \n\nI've been pretty clear that I don't want to be around his brother after that. I've had dinner with him and his parents occasionally, but his brother usually either isn't there or stays up in his room. He might come down to get a plate of whatever we're eating and pass by, but he never stays -- I *thought* because my partner conveyed to him that I'm not okay with being around him. \n\nAnyway. Friendsgiving today. I was honestly having a blast. I got up early and spent all morning making side dishes. I was enjoying spending time with our friends and his parents. And then his brother turns up. And gets sat at the \"kids\" table with us, right next to me. It isn't even that he was there, but that my partner didn't feel inclined to warn me or make sure we weren't sat together or anything.\n\nI feel terrible now, like I overreacted, but I just got up to leave. I went over to his coat and got the keys, and when he asked what I was doing, I might have raised my voice a bit and told him he could either spend time with me or his creepy ass brother. Which was, like. maybe not the thing to do in front of this whole twenty person gathering. We also drove together so I kind of left him stranded, but he WAS at his parents house with his side of the family and we live nearby. Someone probably gave him a ride. I went to my sister's about forty minutes away. He hasn't tried to call or text me. \n\nDid I overreact?

If you handled it like an adult you wouldn\u2019t have been because you may have some valid concerns but you can\u2019t just do what you did unprovoked", "This one is difficult for me, because in the beginning of your story you really come off as someone who just doesn\u2019t like people with special needs - or are willing to help them. Then the drawings came up which is obviously way over the line. But I\u2019m wondering if your negative attitude towards the brother before the drawings has made your partner less sensitive to your valid concerns now. All in all, I think you need to have a very serious potentially final talk with your partner, because there are obviously some major concerns here.", "Yta- why would you say that out loud", "YTA.\n\nIt's his brother.

That's beyond fucked up.", "Tell me you\u2019re a man without telling me you\u2019re a man", "Yeah, that's wild, and particularly disturbing. It's insane for her partner to not think anything of that. It's beyond inappropriate.", "He publicly posted porn he drew of her you degenerate.", "It's her boyfriends BROTHER. Your reading comprehension is bad. And so is your support of the behavior.", "It may be a cultural thing, but no not really. To me, they're the same thing.", "All I\u2019m saying is the young man didn\u2019t do anything. She is acting like a \u201cmean girl\u201d ostracizing him because he is different. \n\nI hope he trust his instincts also. This will be hell on his mental stability and his family. But we\u2019ve already established screw them, right?", "How much you wanna bet this is the brother?", "But I\u2019m not making excuses though. Why can\u2019t anyone see that? OP asked a question. We seemed to be stuck on putting little brother on trial. He did not do anything on Thanksgiving to deserve to be ostracized by his own family. She has every right to leave. She has every right to end the relationship. She doesn\u2019t have the right to walk into his house and assume everyone will neglect lil bro for her benefit. Bad behavior is bad behavior. She made their thanksgiving about her. That\u2019s some AH shit. You ask me if he is an AH I would say yes. But that wasn\u2019t the question, was it? He came down for a plate for Thanksgiving like everyone else does and got bullied for just existing.", "You got me. No point in editing. All other points are moot. I made a typo. Please continue ruining other families holidays", "Thanksgiving is generally with relatives - people that you are related to.  You might not like some of them.  It's sometimes a gathering based on obligations that people have to tolerate.  You know Uncle Fred is going to drink too much and go on a political rant, and Aunt Mary is going to ask way too personal questions about your future plans.\n\nFriendsgiving is roommates, or co-workers, or friends who are not relatives, who get together less out of obligation, and more out of wanting to share the day with people they like, and/or are geographically close to.  \n\nWe can explain it to you, but we can't make you understand it.", "I live in Australia. It's not cultural, you're just a bit thick", "Do you consider your coworkers family? Or the neighbors? Or the nice lady at the store who you stop and chat with daily? Probably not. Those are the types of people who get invited to friendsgiving, including your actual friends who probably have their own families to celebrate come Thanksgiving Day. Friendsgiving is usually celebrated before or after Thanksgiving Day with your informal family or acquaintances.", "Bro, come on. Using her for pornographic images he's putting out onto social media is absolutely not nothing.", "If you'd discovered a colleague or boss had drawn pornographic pictures of your daughter and posted them on social media, for example, you'd be fine with that, yeah? And you'd tell your daughter she has to be around them and be nice to them? If there's nothing wrong with it, let's start allowing teachers, police officers, hell even doctors, to start drawing pornographic images of people and publishing them on social media. They could even print them out and post them through all the neighbours' letterboxes. It's the uncreepy thing to do, after all.", "You're telling me if someone drew pornographic pictures of your mother and she found them online and was reasonably upset you'd tell her she's being dramatic? It's not because he's different. It's because he's a pervert. Being neurodivergent doesn't give you excuses to do shitty things. She doesn't have to be around him if she doesn't want to, so she left.", "He was sat next to OP. The least the partner could have done is separate them. She didn't make Thanksgiving about her. She felt utterly uncomfortable (who wouldn't, sitting next to someone who made pornographic images of you) and got up to leave. She made her feelings a priority instead of others, that is not an AH shit.", "I haven\u2019t celebrated Thanksgiving with my actual relatives (aside from my siblings) in 20 years. My friends are my family.", "See, that explanation makes more sense. It was the way they were explaining it that I couldn't understand, not the concept itself .", "The part I wasn't understanding was using different words, not the general concept of it.", "That's completely different from having a gathering with JUST your friends, and not acquaintances. I don't understand specifically when it's just your close friends.", "If someone drew pornographic pictures of my mom I wouldn\u2019t be at his house. I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect him to magically not be home during a family dinner and I\u2019m just getting to know the family. It\u2019s called foresight. If she doesn\u2019t want to continue the relationship, cool. I\u2019ll respect myself. But I still wouldn\u2019t assume I have the power to upset their family dynamics out of the blue. I would assume that even though he has a disability, that his family loves him. Because at the end of the day, who the hell am I? I mean\u2026 my partner loves me, but I can\u2019t expect everyone else to just neglect to poor boy for a guest. And if they do, that\u2019s a red flag. You don\u2019t treat one of your children any better or worse than the other.", "So you don't understand having out with just non related by blood friends?\n\nFriendsgiving is when they just see their friends for the holidays vs seeing family. Like that's it.", "It really isn\u2019t that hard to understand.", "Sorry I don't understand American culture"]}
