I noticed that a piece of cake from a different friend\u2019s birthday was about 20% of the size it was when I left it in the fridge. \n\nWhen my mother (50F) came into the kitchen, I asked her blankly as to  where most of my slice of cake went. She said that she cut a bit off for my grandparents, which struck me as a bit odd, as she was planning on going the following day, and I couldn\u2019t see any container or anything ready to be taken to see them (the grandparents). We take cake to them all the time so this isn\u2019t out of the ordinary, but I was a little annoyed on principle, as that piece of cake wasn't hers to give away.\n\nFast forward to the following day, my mum is back from visiting my grandparents, and we\u2019ve just finished cleaning up from dinner. I then ask if they (grandparents) enjoyed the slice of cake, when she reveals that she in fact ate it herself. When I ask \u2018Why did you do that and then lie about it?\u2019, she responds with \u2018I\u2019m not very happy that you were rude to me in front of your friend\u2019. I inquire \u2018So you ate my slice of cake because I asked you where my slice of cake went after you had already eaten it?\u2019 She proceeded to shout at me to get out of the room and that she was sick of me and my \u2018rudeness\u2019, and called me \u2018greedy\u2019 because I\u2019m \u2018keeping tabs on everything\u2019.

He told me that I was out of line, and that I shouldn\u2019t argue back to my mother. I said that she couldn't give me a valid reason as to how I was rude, and also wouldn't apologise for eating my cake and lying. The next thing I know is that my Xbox has been disabled remotely for the evening and following day.\n\nI spent an hour in my room on my phone, and then come into the living room, where my parents are watching a film. I ask them if they can explain my they have disabled my Xbox, as I am struggling to see what I have done wrong. My dad tells me that they won't talk to me until I've had a shower. I shower and come back down. I'm then told that they said that they weren't speaking to me. I remind them of what they said only 10 minutes ago, and my mum tells me that I'm arrogant, annoying and (ironically) unable to take accountability for my actions. My xbox is subsequently blocked for the next week, with a 3 hour time limit per day afterwards. My dad said that was because I'd had 7 hours already that day, but I said that I was home alone and that I go for weeks at a time without going on it, so he's just trying to be difficult.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking my mother where my cake went, getting annoyed when she lied about it, and then pressing them for their reasoning behind my punishment?", "created_utc": 1689021759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w5pl9/aita_for_asking_my_mother_where_my_cake_went/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How you deal with this needs to be more than what is absolutely right. Sometimes you need to accept that they took your cake and won't apologize, and figure out what your best options are moving forward within the agency you have.
