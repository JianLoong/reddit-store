I noticed that a piece of cake from a different friend\u2019s birthday was about 20% of the size it was when I left it in the fridge. \n\nWhen my mother (50F) came into the kitchen, I asked her blankly as to  where most of my slice of cake went. She said that she cut a bit off for my grandparents, which struck me as a bit odd, as she was planning on going the following day, and I couldn\u2019t see any container or anything ready to be taken to see them (the grandparents). We take cake to them all the time so this isn\u2019t out of the ordinary, but I was a little annoyed on principle, as that piece of cake wasn't hers to give away.\n\nFast forward to the following day, my mum is back from visiting my grandparents, and we\u2019ve just finished cleaning up from dinner. I then ask if they (grandparents) enjoyed the slice of cake, when she reveals that she in fact ate it herself. When I ask \u2018Why did you do that and then lie about it?\u2019, she responds with \u2018I\u2019m not very happy that you were rude to me in front of your friend\u2019. I inquire \u2018So you ate my slice of cake because I asked you where my slice of cake went after you had already eaten it?\u2019 She proceeded to shout at me to get out of the room and that she was sick of me and my \u2018rudeness\u2019, and called me \u2018greedy\u2019 because I\u2019m \u2018keeping tabs on everything\u2019. As I walked to the door, I pointed out that she notices when I so much as have a can of coke from the fridge. She didn\u2019t like that and sent my dad (50M) to \u2018deal with me\u2019.\n\nI walked out, and my dad followed. He told me that I was out of line, and that I shouldn\u2019t argue back to my mother. I said that she couldn't give me a valid reason as to how I was rude, and also wouldn't apologise for eating my cake and lying. The next thing I know is that my Xbox has been disabled remotely for the evening and following day.\n\nI spent an hour in my room on my phone, and then come into the living room, where my parents are watching a film. I ask them if they can explain my they have disabled my Xbox, as I am struggling to see what I have done wrong. My dad tells me that they won't talk to me until I've had a shower. I shower and come back down. I'm then told that they said that they weren't speaking to me. I remind them of what they said only 10 minutes ago, and my mum tells me that I'm arrogant, annoying and (ironically) unable to take accountability for my actions. My xbox is subsequently blocked for the next week, with a 3 hour time limit per day afterwards. My dad said that was because I'd had 7 hours already that day, but I said that I was home alone and that I go for weeks at a time without going on it, so he's just trying to be difficult.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking my mother where my cake went, getting annoyed when she lied about it, and then pressing them for their reasoning behind my punishment?", "created_utc": 1689021759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w5pl9/aita_for_asking_my_mother_where_my_cake_went/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents should be honest with you, if there\u2019s something they can\u2019t say then they should say that.  They shouldn\u2019t punish you for getting caught lying, what sort of example does that set?  \n\nI am going to give you a tool op.  The next time your parents pull this sort of stuff say something like: \u201cI feel disrespected when you lie to me and take my things, is that what you intend?\u201d  Whatever they respond just say, \u201cok,\u201d in whatever tone of voice is appropriate and walk away.", "An important thing to learn when you are dependent on other people for your whole everything: pick your battles. You could have been out a fifth of your cake slice, now you are punished for weeks. Righteousness rarely gets you anywhere, and while it feels good to let out those feelings, they rarely will help you.\n\nNTA, but be smarter in the future. Until you live under your own roof, you will face some degree of minor inequities from your parents. Because they provide your home, your entertainment, your food. Everything. They control those things. You don't. There is no court to appeal to, no way to argue your case. Not until you are old enough and self sufficient enough to handle your own affairs. Which likely won't be for a while.\n\nYou are a teen. This is a normal thing for people your age to chafe at. At the end of the day, the cake isn't important. The lesson you can learn here is. You'll have bosses, landlords, co-workers, and plenty of other relationships where minor inequities and petty grievances will happen. How you deal with this needs to be more than what is absolutely right. Sometimes you need to accept that they took your cake and won't apologize, and figure out what your best options are moving forward within the agency you have. Is arguing and pointing out going to put you in a better position? Probably not. Can you find a way to protect your cake from being stolen in the future? Probably so. Learn the right lessons.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunatelly any validation we might give you is not gonna change anything for you.\n\nYep your parents are hypocrites and think just because they're the adults they can do no wrong automatically. Apparently apologize to their kid is a big no-no and they would rather go through his whole drama instead. \n\nSince you live with them and are a minor for quite some time you can use this time to practise to steal yourself against stupidity and arrogance as you'll probably meet some people with those qualities later in life as well . \n\nAnyways take this lesson and do better than them in life, but also when/if you ever parent yourself. That is the important thing.", "INFO:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not very happy that you were rude to me in front of your friend\u201d\n\nThis got glossed over.

Especially when the person is your mom and it's a piece of cake. I would probably assume she lied in order to deflect having this convo in front of someone she doesn't know. And based on the rest of the story, it sounds like if she was honest you'd of reacted badly.\n\nLet's be honest, your parents likely pay for 99.9% of everything you eat and drink every day. (Not to mention the Xbox and internet.) I really think going to city hall over a piece of cake is pretty petty.", "NTA. Your mom lied about eating your cake, she should have apologize for eating your cake. She\u2019s pissed you called her out, so she drags your dad in to handle the conflict she created.
