A couple years back I was seeking insight about my then-girlfriend\u2019s mismatched socks. Comments were vicious, but useful. She did not leave me as some hoped, and we married. \n\nThe situation today: My wife, Gia, is heavily pregnant with our first. It\u2019s been tough on her and I\u2019ve tried to be as accommodating as possible until I can take leave and help her out full time until baby is here. \n\nGia has not been able to shave her intimate areas recently. As such, she asked me to do it for her. I told her no and it escalated into a massive fight. It just grosses me out. I go down on her and everything, that\u2019s not what grosses me out. The idea of having to shave long pubic hairs simply puts me off. I know she feels better about herself when she shaves and I know she\u2019s going through something I\u2019ll never understand but it\u2019s not an absolute necessity to be shaved. I just don\u2019t want to, and I wouldn\u2019t expect (or want) her to do it for me either. \n\nWhen she finally relented and started being less emotional, she floated the idea of me paying for a spa day and she could get waxed. Again, I told her no and we had another fight. \n\nI\u2019m well off so she does not work and I supply her needs. She asked why she should have to use her allowance (she has personal, savings, household, and baby) and why can\u2019t I just do this one thing for her? I told her there\u2019s literally no reason to, she has plenty of money from me. She said my options were to pay for the spa day, or shave her. I laughed in her face and walked away, saying \u201cneither\u201d. \n\nSince this all went down on Sunday, I\u2019ve been getting texts about how fucked up it is that I \u201cwon\u2019t help my pregnant wife\u201d. She\u2019s just acting spoiled and ignoring boundaries and being overly emotional. I\u2019m not \u201crefusing\u201d to help her, I\u2019ve been doing nothing but helping her even after I work all day. We have a housekeeper right now so she really isn\u2019t expected to do anything and it\u2019s beyond me why I should have to give her MORE money on top of the 8k I just gave her. \n\nAm I really the AH in this situation because I don\u2019t want to shave her, and don\u2019t want to give her more money?", "created_utc": 1678142643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kgpj5/aita_for_not_shaving_my_pregnant_wife_and_not/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As she gets more pregnant, there will be more and more fluids that come out and getting pubes stuck in a pantiliner is no fun. She\u2019s giving you so much and possibly sacrificing her life to produce a child for you both (yes, pregnancy is dangerous and life threatening.

Having 8k to spend for yourself to have fun is a lot the wife is just being spoiled", "But she can command another man\u2019s body to shave for her. \n\nAnd he\u2019s unreasonable for saying no.", "You don't get to drip-feed additional, self-serving info in the comments and try to change people's judgement on that basis.\n\nYou're still an AH for a bunch of reasons, including that you claim to be sooooo rich but you're dying on the hill of paying for your pregnant wife's bikini wax. Even at a nice spa this is less than $100. Prioritize.", "Why would I make a post with a bunch of unnecessary financial details? No one likes those overly detailed posts and it doesn\u2019t even pertain to the actual conflict at hand. You\u2019re the one saying things that are flat out wrong. I might be being an AH in this situation but to say she\u2019s being financially abused is actually ridiculous and I\u2019m going to call it out."]}
